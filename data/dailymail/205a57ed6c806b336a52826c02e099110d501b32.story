It was always going to be a tough battle to claim the title of Britain’s brainiest child.

But viewers of Child Genius have questioned whether the Channel 4 show went too far as two boys were shown sobbing after losing the competition.

When maths prodigy Rubaiyat, 11, was defeated by eventual winner Sharon Daniel the cameras zoomed in for a close-up shot of him bursting into tears.

Upset: Eight-year-old Tudor Mendel-Idowu is shown crying as he lost the final of Channel 4 show Child Genius

Then viewers were also shown Tudor Mendel-Idowu – who is just eight years old – crying as he also lost to Sharon, 11, in the final showdown.

Rubaiyat, who has an A* in maths at GCSE, was level on points with Sharon after correctly answering 16 questions on particle physics. They faced a tie-break until Sharon successfully challenged a wrong answer ruling on her specialist subject of the Battle of Stamford Bridge, meaning she won the point and got through to the final two.

As the boys were shown in tears, viewers took to Twitter to criticise the ‘cruel’ competition.

One wrote: ‘Oh Rubaiyat, you’re breaking my heart! #ChildGenius – what a horrible competition!’

Another tweeted: ‘This programme is terrible – too much pressure on the kids.’

Afterwards, Rubaiyat’s father Miraz said he should be proud of himself for getting as far as he did.

Physicist Dr Brian Wecht, who set the string theory questions, told Rubaiyat that most people needed a PhD to understand the subject and that he was ‘remarkable’.

Earlier in the series Rubaiyat, from South London, was shown reading two books called How To Make Friends and How To Be Happy. He is trying to convince his parents to let him undertake a degree course. Winner Sharon’s mother Hepzibah said she had not pushed her daughter to study.

The doctor from Bolton told the programme: ‘She has her own way of doing it.’ Sharon, who is a former under-11s UK girls’ chess champion, said her determined nature helped her win: ‘Once I set my mind on something I won’t give up.’

Tudor was visibly upset after he lost the final 10-6. His parents, Tolu, a 39-year-old pastor, and Gold, a 36-year-old NHS administrator, had put him through a rigorous coaching regime and were shown wincing or shaking their heads when he got a question wrong.

Last night Claude Knights, chief executive of children’s welfare charity Kidscape, criticised the show for ‘exploiting’ children by filming them in ‘visible emotional distress’. She said: ‘A number of the parents were sadly too preoccupied with the end goal and their own ambitions to realise that their children were being taken beyond safe levels of endurance.

‘We also have to ask what aspects of intelligence were being tested, and what was the point of pushing these bright young minds “to their limits”, in for the most part, pointless tasks devoid of real context. The need to consider the nurturing and development of the whole child was ignored in favour of cruel entertainment.’

The competition is overseen by British Mensa and featured children aged seven to 12.

A Channel 4 spokesman said chaperones and a psychologist were available for the children during and after filming and the families were happy with the show.

‘We take our duty of care very seriously indeed and have been guided by the Ofcom code and a set of bespoke processes and protocols throughout,’ he said. ‘[Rubaiyat] did extremely well in the competition and he and his family are very proud of his achievements.’
