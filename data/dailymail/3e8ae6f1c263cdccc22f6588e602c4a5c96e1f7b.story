An Arkansas woman has learned the hard way how easy it is to overdo it with eye shadow.

Brandy Allen, 31, from Fayetteville, was arrested Monday for allegedly shoplifting $144 worth of makeup from a local beauty store.

But her booking photo tells the tale of her alleged crime better than any arrest report.

The makeup enthusiast was photographed for her mugshot with her eyelids smeared bright pink and blue.

Living in the shadows: Brandy Allen, 31, from Arkansas, has been arrested for allegedly shoplifting $144 worth of eye shadow and other makeup from a beauty store.

Police said they received a call Monday afternoon from the general manager of Ulta Beauty Store in Fayetteville about a suspected shoplifter.

According to the arrest report obtained by 5News Online, Allen was spotted indiscriminately grabbing makeup by the handfuls without looking at prices or colors.

Investigators stated that the makeup fanatic entered the store on North Mall Avenue with a companion who tried to create a diversion by asking employees questions and leading them away from Allen.

When officers responded to the scene, the manager approached Allen and asked to examine the contents of her purse.

After a few moments of rummaging through her bag, Allen took out several eye shadow containers.

According to the report, as the woman pulled out the little boxes, she would smear the surface of the colorful powder in an attempt to make the beauty products appear used.

Makeup heist: Allen was caught with boxes of lifted eye shadow and a red eyeliner in her purse that she had allegedly stolen from Ulta Beauty Store in Fayetteville 

The 31-year-old then became belligerent and unleashed a torrent of profanities, claiming that no one had witnessed her steal anything.

Police noted that customers with young children were within earshot of Allen’s foul-mouthed tirade.

Ms Allen then allegedly pulled out a red eyeliner from her purse, which a store employee noted she had helped her pick out earlier, and broke it in half claiming that it was hers all along.

Just after 3pm Monday, Allen was booked into Washington County Detention Center. She was released hours later after posting $840 bond.
