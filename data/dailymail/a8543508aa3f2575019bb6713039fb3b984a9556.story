Real Housewife of Miami star Lisa Hochstein and her plastic surgeon husband have had to postpone plans for their Star Island dream home after complaints from locals.

Lisa and husband Dr. Leonard Hochstein want to demolish the mansion at 42 Star Island Drive and rebuild, but Miami Beach preservationists claim the current structure has great historic value and must be maintained.

On Wednesday Miami Beach city commissioners denied a resolution by the Hochsteins to not designate the home as historic, meaning that the debate over the future of house will continue.

Dozens of local preservationists who make up the Miami Design Preservation League showed up to the two and a half hour hearing.

‘There is no question that the property is of historic and architectural value,’ one member told WSVN.com.

The ivory mansion was built in 1920 and designed by Florida's first registered architect Walter DeGarmo.

It is valued at $9.1 million and boasts elegant arched windows, grand columns and balconies with intricate wrought-iron railings.

The couple bought the mansion at a foreclosure auction in late 2012 and claim it is ‘falling apart,’ reports The Miami Herald.

They say the entire structure is sinking and has slid 30 inches below the floodplain. They also allege that the home is dangerous and the roof could collapse.

‘We bought this house with the intention of building our dream home,’ Lisa Hochstein, a 29-year-old who has made three appearances in Playboy magazine,  told The Miami Herald.

‘If we knew this was going to happen, we would have never purchased this home.’

Miami Beach's Historic Preservation Board has thrown its support behind the appeal for historic designation, and doesn't believe the home is in as bad a shape as the owners claim.

Dr. Hochstein says he has followed every law, code, and rule and as the owner he should have the right to demolish it.

‘I'm just tired of being punished for 
following the rules,’ he told WSVN.com, ‘And doing every single thing 
that every citizen of Miami Beach has had the right to do up until now.’

Several more board meetings are expected before a final vote takes place.

The Hochsteins want to tear down the existing structure and replace it with a new 14,000-square-foot mansion including a wine cellar and five-car garage.

Self-proclaimed ‘professional housewife’ Lisa Hochstein married legendary Miami plastic surgeon Dr. Lenny Hochstein, known as the ‘Boob God’ of Miami, in 2009.

After traveling the world together to exotic locales like Venice, St. Tropez, and Paris, the couple recently purchased a house on Star Island where they wanted to live with their two dogs, Puffy and Leo.
