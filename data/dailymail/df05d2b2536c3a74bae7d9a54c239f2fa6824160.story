Xian Chen, 35, was locked up for 12 weeks yesterday after his colleague suffered a cut head and burned arm during a vicious knife fight

A chef has been jailed after he brawled with another cook over who would prepare a chicken breast at a Chinese restaurant.

Xian Chen, 35, was locked up for 12 weeks yesterday after his colleague suffered a cut head and burned arm at the vicious knife fight in the Fontana Chinese eaterie.

Chen admitted affray at South East Suffolk magistrates court in Ipswich.

The incident sparked a manhunt on land and in the air as police searched for the chef for nearly three hours after he fled the scene in Cattawade, near Brantham, Essex, at 1.40pm on Saturday December 29.

One of the men had been preparing vegetables while the other was said to have been cooking rice, the court heard.

Chen claimed a furious row began over who would cut up a chicken breast.

The injured man, who has not been named, told police that Chen then started a fight by throwing a punch at him.

The victim, who was unarmed, was hit on the head with a knife.

Both cooks fell on to a hot oven during the brawl, leaving the victim with a burn to his arm.

Chen ran off and police were alerted, and several officers and the police helicopter went to the scene.

Chen's victim was left lying on the ground outside with a five-centimetre cut to his head, a burn to his left forearm, bruises and swollen top lip.

He was taken to hospital, where the cut was stapled.

The bizarre incident at the Fontana Restaurant in Suffolk sparked a police manhunt

The police helicopter was scrambled and flew over the nearby River Stour scouring bushes and hedge in a bid to find Chen.

Chen, of The Fontana restaurant, was found and arrested in nearby woodland just before 4.25pm.

A restaurant spokesman has today refused to comment.
