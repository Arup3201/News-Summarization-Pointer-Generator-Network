Enner Valencia is out of West Ham’s trip to Arsenal after treading on a broken cup at home.

And the bizarre injury to Sam Allardyce’s £12million summer signing leaves the Hammers boss with just one recognised striker fit to face Arsene Wenger’s side.

When asked how his frontline was shaping up, Hammers boss Allardyce admitted: 'Well there is one but it's not really an injury in terms of an accident, which is Enner Valencia.

Valencia, pictured in action against Chelsea, has been ruled out after treading on a broken cup 

'He had an accident at home and has cut his big toe quite severely on a broken cup and that's been stitched.

'We're not exactly sure [how long he is out for] but we think it will be too soon to be considered for this game.

'So a freak accident at home is something that we didn't expect and these are the things that seem to happen.'

Valencia has struggled to make an impact with just five goals in 30 appearances since his move to east London.

Sam Allardycwe has come under growing pressure at West Ham after a disappointing run for the Hammers 

But he could still have anticipated featuring heavily in the Hammers' run-in with Andy Carroll expected to be out until the end of the season after undergoing surgery to repair torn knee ligaments.

Carlton Cole is also out of Saturday’s London derby as he steps up his training schedule in a bid to return from a hamstring strain.

So it means Diafra Sakho is the only frontman available to Allardyce at The Emirates as his side try to get back to winning ways after going through their five games in February without a victory.

'Of course [Valencia] being one of our few strikers that were available, it's a big blow for us,' Allardyce added.

Here Sportsmail looks at other unusual injuries which have kept footballers out of action over the years.

RICHARD WRIGHT: Wright was ruled out of Everton's FA Cup fourth-round replay at Chelsea after suffering a freak injury during the warm-up. Wright ignored a notice warning him not to practice in the goalmouth and promptly fell over the sign, suffering a twisted ankle. The same player also damaged his shoulder falling through a loft as he was trying to pack away his suitcases.

RIO FERDINAND: During his spell at Leeds the England defender managed to pick up a tendon strain in his knee watching television. Ferdinand had his foot up on a coffee table for a number of hours and ended up injuring a tendon behind his knee.

SEAN FLYNN: The then Kidderminster captain suffered a broken nose, busted lip and bruised toes after tripping over his son's toy cars.

DAVE BEASANT: The veteran goalkeeper managed to rule himself out for eight weeks in 1993 when he dropped a bottle of salad cream on his foot, severing the tendon in his big toe.

DAVID JAMES: The England goalkeeper once pulled a muscle in his back when reaching for the television remote control and the keen angler also tweaked his shoulder when trying to land a monster carp.

ALEX STEPNEY: In 1975 the Manchester United goalkeeper Alex Stepney dislocated his jaw while shouting at his defenders during a match against Birmingham.

CHIC BRODIE: The Brentford goalkeeper's career came to an abrupt end in October 1970 when he collided with a sheepdog which had run on to the pitch. Brodie shattered his kneecap while the dog got the ball. "The dog might have been a small one, but it just happened to be a solid one," he reflected.

SANTIAGO CANIZARES: The Spain goalkeeper missed the 2002 World Cup after accidentally shattering a bottle of aftershave in his hotel sink. A piece of glass fell on his foot, severing a tendon in his big toe.

ALAN WRIGHT: The diminutive former Aston Villa full-back strained his knee by stretching to reach the accelerator in his new Ferrari. He subsequently swapped the sports car for a Rover 416.

SVEIN GRONDALEN: The Norway defender had to withdraw from an international during the 1970s after colliding with a moose while out jogging.

KEVIN KYLE: The Scotland and Sunderland striker missed a game having scalded his testicles and thigh whilst attempting to feed his eight-month-old son, who kicked a jug of hot water over his father whilst sat on his lap.

ALAN MULLERY: The England star missed the 1964 tour of South America after injuring his back while brushing his teeth.

DARREN BARNARD: The former Barnsley midfielder was sidelined for five months with a torn knee ligament after he slipped in a puddle of his puppy's urine on the kitchen floor.

LEE HODGES: The then Barnet player slipped on a bar of soap in the shower and wrenched his groin.

KIRK BROADFOOT: The Rangers defender scalded a cheek when an egg he had poached in the microwave blew up and squirted hot water into his face. The Scotland international was treated in hospital but managed to not let his egg error rule him out of any games.

CHARLIE GEORGE: Arsenal's 1971 FA Cup hero managed to cut off his toe with a lawnmower.

DARIUS VASSELL: The then Aston Villa striker missed several games after he drilled through his toe nail with a home power drill thinking it would relieve the pressure on a swollen toe. The attempt at DIY surgery succeeded only in giving the toe an infection which required medical attention.
