Ralph Lauren has agreed to destroy a range of its athletic shoes, after popular footwear brand Converse filed a lawsuit against the company claiming that the designs were a direct copy of its iconic Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers.

Last October, Converse Inc. filed trademark infringement lawsuits against 31 companies, including Ralph Lauren, alleging that it competitors had knocked off the sneaker's mid sole stripe and rubber toe cap.

But, according to Women's Wear Daily Converse has now reached an out of court settlement with Ralph Lauren Corp, which stipulates that the rival brand must scrap all of its copycat sneakers within the next 30 days.

Coveted copies: The two companies have reached a settlement agreement, which stipulates that Ralph Lauren has 30 days to scrap the 36 different style of sneakers Converse had named in its complaint

The two companies have filed a joint motion to end the case pending before the US International Trade Commission.

Ralph Lauren has less than one month to destroy the 36 different styles of shoes named in the complaint as well as the related molds, parts, tools, marketing, packaging and promotional materials. 

The company will also pay Converse an undisclosed sum, although the brand has maintained that the lawsuits are about more than just money.

'The goal really is to stop this action,' Converse chief executive Jim Calhoun told the New York Times last October.

He added: 'I think we’re quite fortunate here to be in the possession of what we would consider to be an American icon.'

The Converse All Star, the brand's first sneaker created for basketball players, was introduced in 1917 and was named after famed basketball player Chuck Taylor. 

But the outlet noted that trademark infringement is difficult to prove in the fashion world.

Converse has to demonstrate that its design is not a part of a larger trend, but rather it is one that consumers associate with its brand.

Skechers, Walmart, K-Mart, FILA and Ed Hardy were among the other companies accused of copying the brand's 'Chucks'.
