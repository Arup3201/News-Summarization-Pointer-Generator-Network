A 61-year-old man was overcome with joy when he went to Grand Rapids, Michigan last month to encounter a man, 81, he believed to be the father he never met.

However, paternity results obtained yesterday reveal the pair are not related after all.

Samuel Childress, received the test results in the mail on Monday, February 2 and was shocked to see it was negative, said his wife Donna Childress on Tuesday morning.

'It's been rough on him,' she said of her husband finding out the results. 'He's been up and down all night.'

The unfortunate maternity muddle began when Tony Trapani, 81, of Grand Rapids was cleaning out some filing cabinets following the death of his wife when he discovered a 56-year-old letter.

The note had been hidden from him by his wife and was from a woman claiming that she had given birth to a son, and he was the father, reports Michigan Live.

The letter: A letter says Samuel Childress is Tony Trapani's son but a paternity result revealed on February 2 proves that the pair are not related 

Bond: Despite the men not being father and son like this found letter stated, they will remain friends and continue to build a father and son bond 

Trapani reached out to Childress and the two men tearfully embraced believing they were related. 

They spent a week bonding with one another and decided to take a paternity test to make sure the news wan't too good to be true. 

Despite the paternity results being negative, the men have chosen to continue a relationship with on another.

'They're keeping that bond,' said Donna Childress.

'That paper doesn't mean anything to him. That bond has been made - and we're going to move on from here.'

Years ago, Childress resigned himself to the fact that he had been abandoned by his father. Even though Trapani may not be his father by blood the men have become close and will act as though they are father and son.

As for why Trapani's wife would hide the misleading letter from Childress' mother for all these years, Trapani points out the difficulties the couple faced trying to have children of their own.

'She wanted children,' said Trapani of his late wife in an interview with Fox 17. 

'She couldn't have any. She tried and tried.'

That being said, Trapani still seems to resent her decision, no matter what her motivation may have been, saying; 'He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me,' said Trapani after thinking Childress was his.

Childress spent his youth in Pennsylvania and described growing up feeling a void because he did not know who his father was.

Lost time: Childress' mother wrote Trapani with the news of his alleged son over 50 years ago, but his wife hid the letter (above)

As for the letter, written in 1959, it began; 'I have a little boy. He is five years old now. What I'm trying to say Tony is he is your son. He was born November 14th, 1953.'

When he never responded, Childress' mother simply assumed the man wanted nothing to do with the boy, and informed the child of his decision.

'I always asked my mom, I said, 'Well what does he look like?'' says Childress. 

'She said, 'Well, go look in the mirror.''

Childress may not ever learn who his father is but now he has a father figure he can proudly call his friend.
