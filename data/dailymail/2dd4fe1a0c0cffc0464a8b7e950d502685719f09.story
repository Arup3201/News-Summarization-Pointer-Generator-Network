Two U.S. bound planes were forced to land at Heathrow and Paris this afternoon after suffering mid-air emergencies within minutes of each other over British airspace.

A Kuwait Airways plane had to land at Heathrow Airport shortly after take-off while an Air France aircraft returned to Charles De Gaulle in Paris.

It is believed the cabin of Kuwait Airways 777 filled with smoke as it approached the Irish Sea off Wales, forcing the captain to turn the plane around and land back at Heathrow.

Dramatic: Two U.S. bound planes were forced to land at Heathrow and Paris this afternoon after suffering mid-air emergencies within minutes of each other. This included a Kuwait Airways plane

Emergency: The Air France 010 flight left Paris at 3.42pm BST and was over the Irish Sea when it experienced technical problems and was forced to return to the French capital

Passengers were then taken of the plane while the incident was investigated. It is thought the smoke was steam from an air conditioner unit.

The Air France 010 flight, which left Paris at 3.42pm BST, was over the Irish Sea between Liverpool and Blackpool when it experienced technical problems in the cockpit.

Its captain turned the plane around and headed back to the French capital.

Both flights were heading to New York's JFK airport.

Problems: The Kuwait Airways flight had left Heathrow Airport and was over Wales close to the Irish Sea when it had to return to the airport

A spokesman for Air France said: 'Due to a minor technical incident the AF010 which was going to JFK returned and landed at Charles De Gaulle but there is no more issue. It was just a minor technical incident.'

He added that it was a heated windscreen failure that needed to be dealt with back in Paris.

The Air France flight landed back at Charles De Gaulle at 6.06pm BST.  The 261 passengers were moved to a new flight, which has since landed in New York.

A spokesman for National Air Traffic Services (NATS) said both incidents were minor.

Meanwhile a Heathrow spokesman said: 'Yesterday evening, a Kuwait Airways aircraft had to land at Heathrow Airport shortly after take-off due to reports of steam appearing in the cabin. Shortly after landing it was established mist was coming from an air conditioner unit and the incident was stood down. As a precautionary measure, and in line with standard procedures, emergency services were on standby as the aircraft landed.’
