A son was denied a fair slice of his dead mother's £1m fortune after he stopped visiting her and neglected to send flowers on Mother's Day, the High Court has heard.

Kenneth Hart is suing his sister, Susan Burbidge, 47, whom he claims controlled his 'vulnerable' mother Phyllis Hart's finances in the months before her death aged 86 in November 2008.

He and his brother, Paul, 49, are now urging a High Court judge to overturn cash and property transfers worth around £450,000 executed by their mother in Susan's favour in the year before she died.

Kenneth, 67, described his mother as a 'good woman and housewife' but claimed she 'could not make up her mind about anything' - even when it came to choosing her own curtains.

And she had no idea about financial matters, he told the court.

Phyllis was widowed when his father, Ernest, died in 2005, Mr Hart told the court, inheriting the £1m-plus fortune Ernest had created through a thriving marquee business, Ernest Hart and Sons.

By 2007, his mother was increasingly under his sister's influence, insisted Kenneth, claiming that 'any suggestion you made to mother would have to be passed by Susan'.

Tension was already building within the family after Phyllis announced the previous year that she was transferring part of the company's business premises to Susan, the court heard.

Kenneth, from Poole, Dorset, said this news left him 'annoyed' and conceded that he went for at least 12 months without visiting his mother, although he 'never stopped caring for her'.

His sister's barrister, Paul Emmerson, suggested that Kenneth had succeeded in 'alienating' his mother, who had become increasingly 'angry and bitter' at his apparent indifference.

She had every right to 'seek sanctuary' with her daughter and son-in-law, said the barrister, as they were 'doing everything for her' and had taken her in.

Mr Emmerson also cited complaints made by Phyllis about Kenneth's alleged neglect of his filial duties, including his failure to send her flowers on Mother's Day and sending a Christmas card 'which didn't even have the word mother on it'.

She was 'entitled to feel upset and to distribute her property as she wanted', he added.

Kenneth said he had always loved his mother but Mr Emmerson suggested he 'could have made her aware of how you felt about her'.

'You could have stayed in more regular 
contact, and you could have written to her or sent her Christmas and 
birthday cards?' the barrister put to him.

'I think I did send her Christmas cards,' Kenneth replied, although accepting that he 'could have done more'.

He had been working long hours and into weekends, he said, and had done his best to keep in touch when she moved house during her final year, also denying any terminal rift with his mother.

Describing the family culture he told the court: 'We were never a close family and could go for weeks and weeks without seeing one another, but we were never at loggerheads'.

The Hart brothers' barrister, Charles Auld, argued that Phyllis' transactions in her daughter's favour 'call for an explanation' and urged the judge to rule them invalid unless Susan can establish that her mother was acting of her own free will.

But Mr Emmerson argued that Phyllis was 'not the vulnerable old lady' portrayed by her sons.

She had 'come out of herself' since the death of her controlling husband, he told the court, and managed to weather a series of 'hectoring' exchanges with Paul, some of which he taped, said the barrister.

'She was strong and independent of thought, and perfectly capable of standing up to Paul Hart and being annoyed by his actions and the apparent indifference of Ken Hart,' he told the court.

The brothers' lawyers say that, by the time of Phyllis' death, nearly everything her husband had left her - valued at over £1m - had been transferred to Susan Burbidge and her husband, Brian, subject to an 'unsigned loan agreement' that the couple would pay back £410,000 into her estate.

Kenneth and Paul are asking Judge Sir William Blackburne to overturn a £290,000 cash transfer to Susan and her husband and the transfer of the proceeds of sale of the Hart family home in Beacon Park Road, Upton, Poole, to the couple.

Phyllis had lived in that house throughout her marriage but moved into Little Manor Farm, in Poole, shortly before her death.

The brothers' claim is being hotly contested by Susan and Brian Burbidge.

The High Court hearing continues.
