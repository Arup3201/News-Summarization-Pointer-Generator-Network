A lavish waterfront mansion in Maryland belonging to a tech tycoon has been destroyed by an enormous fire which has left the building a smoking ruin and growing concerns about the safety of six people.

Emergency crews in Annapolis were scrambled early on Monday morning to the blaze at the waterfront home of Don Pyle, a former CEO.

Eight-five firefighters were on scene later in the morning fighting the fire at the 16,000sq ft home, which caught alight around 3:30am.

Pyle, 56, lived in the home with his wife Sandra and their two adult sons. There are unconfirmed reports that Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren. Authorities are reportedly looking for six people, none of whom have been located.

Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am, and is now little more than a smoking ruin

Owner: There are unconfirmed reports that Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren. Authorities are reportedly looking for six people, none of whom have been located

Intense: Eighty-five firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the early-morning blaze - which still needed attention at midday on Monday

Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle revealed  that the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house

According to local station WJLA, none of the home's residents have been accounted for.

Neighbors have told the media that they hope the Pyles were out of town when the fire started. 

'We are hoping and praying there is no loss of life,' County Executive Steve Schuh told Capital Gazette. Another neighbor, Anne Tiffany, described the Pyles as 'lovely people.'

'They've always been kind to me,' she said.

Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people.' 

Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies.

In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley.

His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia.

He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house.

His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from Chesapeake Bay and it has an estimated $9million value.

Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty.

Inferno: The blaze, pictured from the air, tore through the home. Bottom right, firefighters can be seen standing near the pools as they spray water at the ruins

Aftermath: Firefighters were still spraying water on the smoking ruins after the sun rose. Homicide detectives were at the scene - thought it isn't certain whether the owners were home

Gutted: The house, which still needed water poured on it, was ravaged by the flames. Only some of the stone core remained, along with some twisted metal frames

Wreckage: The home had often been the site of charity gatherings and parties, according to neighbors and local reports

Huge loss: The home, built in 2005 to be a cross between a castle and a beach house, was worth an estimated $9million

Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement.

Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture.

Though most of the fire appeared to have been extinguished by late Monday morning, some firefighters were still reportedly pouring water on the ruins at midday - almost nine hours after the fire started. Fire chiefs said they were not able to search the house during the blaze, and that it is unlikely they will be able to confirm whether there are any victims until Tuesday.

ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic.

'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.'

Emergency crews: Because the house was nowhere near a fire hydrant, the Anne Arundel County Fire Department deployed a boat to a nearby jetty
