James Smith is the most common full name in the country with more than 38,000 people bearing the moniker, while Maria Garcia occurs most frequently among women. 

A list of the most common combinations of first and second names in America compiled by WhitePages.com and published on Slate also gives an interesting look at the racial make-up of the U.S.

While most of the male names are run-of-the-mill with Anglo-Saxon origins, most of the female names have Spanish roots.

The name game: According to a list compiled by WhitePages, the most popular full name for men in the U.S. is James Smith while the most popular for women is Maria Rodriqguez

1. James Smith - 38,3132. Michael Smith - 34,8103. Robert Smith - 34,2694. Maria Garcia - 32,0925. David Smith - 31,2946. Maria Rodriguez - 30,5077. Mary Smith - 28,6928. Maria Hernandez - 27,8369. Maria Martinez - 26,95610. James Johnson - 26,85011. William Smith - 26,07412. Robert Johnson - 28,87413. John Smith - 25,255

In
fact, all but one of the female names on the list start with Maria and 
end with a Hispanic last names such as Garcia, Rodriguez, Hernandez and 
Martinez.

Although there is no definitive explanation of why Hispanic names dominate the women's list, a quarter of all births were to Hispanic mothers in according to census data from 2011.

The only other female name on the list is another from of Maria - Mary Smith.

Males get a bit more diversity when it comes to first names with the options of James, Michael, Robert, David or William. 

Johnson is the only alternative to Smith for male last names on the list.

But this list may soon change since most parents are no longer using the first names included on the list when naming their babies.

The boys name Jacob and girls name Sophia, were the most popular baby names in 2012, according to data from the Social Security Administration.

These names come as no surprise to Pamela Redmond Satran, co-creator of the baby name website Nameberry.

'They're classic, with a rich history yet a lot of contemporary style,' she said. 'And they appeal to a wide range of parents so their popularity is understandable.'
