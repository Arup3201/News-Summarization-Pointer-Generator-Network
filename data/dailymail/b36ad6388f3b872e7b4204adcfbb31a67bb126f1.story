He is a convicted murderer and rapist, but Barry Whiteoak has won damages after a tribunal found he was racially discriminated in an Australian jail - for being British..

The 66-year-old UK-born killer and repeat sex offender won the payout based on claims he suffered racial discrimination when classified as a British lawful non-citizen.

Whiteoak's taxpayer-funded legal battle lasted six years and cost up to $100,000 (£55,362) in legal aid, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Victim: Irish nurse Noreen Hannon, pictured, was murdered by Barry Whiteoak in her flat in Parramatta, Sydney, in 1983

In jail since 1983 for the murder of Noreen Hannon, the Yorkshire-native based his racial discrimination claim on his British nationality - which meant he was not entitled to perks including day release.

Despite the marathon compensation battle, Whiteoak won $500 (£276) compensation, all of which goes to the Victims Support Fund for victims of crime.

Whiteoak forced his way into 25-year-old nurse Noreen Hannon's Parramatta flat, in western Sydney, in September 1983, after she rejected his sexual advances.

He then stabbed and strangled her to death, leaving her naked body in the lift of the building.

Ms Hannon arrived in Australia from Ireland on working holiday before she was killed.

Despite pleading innocent, the killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.

At the time he committed Ms Hannon's murder, Whiteoak was on parole for a rape he committed in 1980, while already on parole for indecently assaulting a woman a knifepoint in 1978.

Arriving in Australia as a 20-year-old, by 27, Whiteoak had been jailed for the indecent assault, in which he told the victim: 'It would be easy to carve you up'.

Crazy: Ms Hannon's boyfriend at the time of her murder, Michael Maher, has slammed Whiteoak's racial damages claim

For the rape of his next victim, Whiteoak received an 18-month jail sentence and was described by the judge as an inadequate, lonely socially inept man.

Ms Hannon's boyfriend at the time of her death, Michael Maher, has called the convicted murderer's claim 'crazy'.

'It's an absolute disgrace when people who have genuine cases can't get Legal Aid but these guys can,' he said.

'He is a serial rapist and murderer who should have no rights in prison, never mind the right to bring this case and we have had to pay for it.'

Under new laws that saw all life sentences redetermined, Whiteoak's prison term for the murder was cut to a minimum of 15 years in 1994, with the rest of his life to be served on parole.

He was to be released in 2003, but public outcry and political pressure kept him in jail.

The rapist was refused bail multiple times until August 2008, when the Department of Immigration cancelled his permanent residency visa, thus ensuring the killer's deportation to the UK.

In December 2008, Whiteoak launched his racial discrimination case, following Corrective Services implementing a blanket ban on lawful non-citizens like himself being classified a C3, which allows them to apply for prison perks including day release.

The murderer told the Administrative Decisions Tribunal: 'It is discrimination because the policy decisions are treating me differently to what an Australian citizen is treated'.

Whiteoak said the decision to cancel his permanent residency was based purely on his British nationality and not his offensive behaviour.

He asked the tribunal to use all powers available to persuade and or force the Corrective Services to change his classification back to what it was originally.

This month, after multiple hearings, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled that Corrective Services had racially discriminated against Whiteoak under the Anit-Discrimination Act.

The lengthy case has resulted in a NSW Legal Aid review of foreign-born cases that are pending.

NSW Legal Aid CEO Bill Grant said the review will determine if there is appropriate ways of spending limited Legal Aid resources.

It is believed the case was funded by Legal Aid because it involved a 'fundamental legal principle'.

However, the loophole had been closed before the case went to the tribunal.
