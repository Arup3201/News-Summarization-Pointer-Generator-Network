Rescued: Jon Hammar, 27, pictured, has opened up for the first time about his horrific ordeal, which saw him spend more than four months in a corrupt prison on the Texas-Mexico border on weapons charges

A U.S. Marine veteran who was thrown into a Mexican prison for carrying an antique shotgun across the border says gangsters threatened to behead him while he was in jail.

Jon Hammar, 27, has opened up for the first time about the horrific ordeal, which saw him spend more than four months in a corrupt prison on the Texas-Mexico border on weapons charges.

He was released just days before Christmas but says there were times he believed he wouldn't escape with his life.

'They threw every threat in the book 
at me,' Hammar told McClatchy Newspapers. 'They'd cut my head off, 
they told my family.'

The terrifying threat took Hammar, a 
sufferer of post traumatic stress disorder, straight back to his tours of 
duty as a U.S. Marine in Iraq. He added that the gangsters demanded money in 
exchange for his life.

The former Marine was arrested on August 13 when
 he crossed into Mexico in a motor home heading for Costa Rica on a 
surfing trip with a friend.

But when Mexican border control 
searched their Winnebago and discovered his great-grandfather's 
vintage shotgun, he was thrown behind bars. His travel companion was set
 free because the gun wasn't his.

The Matamoros prison where Hammar was
 kept is notorious for being controlled by the criminal gang Los Zetas. Its members regularly use beheadings and mass killings to instill fear 
in rivals and protect their drug trafficking and criminal activities, 
according to McClatchy.

Hammar said not guards but prison inmates controlled the facility and that he quickly learnt they weren't to be messed with.

'There was a tattoo artist in there, 
and he said to me, "You can die in this place for nothing,"' Hammar 
said. He added that prisoners were 'full-blown' mobsters, some of whom 
were serving triple life sentences. 'I knew not to go around picking 
fights with anybody,' he said.

Hammar explained that, while in the prison, he never knew when the next meal would come.

'You eat when someone gives you food,' he told McClatchy.

But while the prison guards being hardened, he said they were more efficient than the Mexican authorities.

'To me, they were acting more 
professional than the officials in Mexico. If I needed a translator, and
 the cartel was talking to me, I had three. But when I'd go to court, 
they laughed at me when I asked for a translator,' he explained.

After suffering for four months in 
dirty conditions and on little food, Hammar was finally released on 
December 21. But he is only now recovering from a stomach virus and 
dehydration he says he contracted while in the Mexican prison.

After his relieved father collected 
him at the Texas border, the pair began the 22-hour drive to Florida to 
spend Christmas with his mother. But he fell ill with
 a fever in Lafayette, Louisiana, and was hospitalized there and then 
again after arriving in South Florida.

'I think it was just an accumulation, just not being in a good environment,' Hammar told McClatchy.

Hammar developed post traumatic stress disorder following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet 
when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq.

After serving a four-year battlefield tour, he
 served another four years in the reserves then checked himself into a 
nine-month PTSD treatment program in California, which is where he was 
immediately before taking the trip to Central America.

Hammar said he checked twice with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to see if carrying the gun to Mexico would be a problem.

'I went to two different border 
crossings and asked a dozen different people, and at the end of the day,
 I got a smile on their face, you know, here’s the paperwork. Enjoy 
yourself,' Hammar told the news service.

'At any point, if anyone had told me that [I risked jail in Mexico], I would’ve pawned the gun in a pawnshop in a second.'

The 27-year-old thanked Americans, 
particularly his fellow Marines, for the outpouring of support he 
received while locked in the prison.

'In America, we have people who 
care,' he said. 'I'm really grateful. But at the same time I kind of 
expected that from Marines. Marines don't just throw each other under 
the bus. They look after each other.'

Senator Bill Nelson, the state's 
Democratic senator, has sought written records from Customs and Border 
Protection and has asking for an investigation.

Speaking ahead of Hammar's release, 
Nelson said: 'No American should be in a Mexican jail for five months 
without being able to have his case in front of a judge. We're grateful,
 this is a good Christmas present.'

Hammar's attorney Eddie Varon Levy flew from Mexico City to Matamoros to pick his client up on December 21. Later that day, the pair flew to Brownsville, Texas.

'I'm very 
happy. I feel that the Mexican legal system came out the way it should 
have,' Varon Levy said. A defense lawyer said it was 
determined there was no intent to commit a crime.

Nelson was among a handful of local 
elected officials who urged the State Department to help get Hammar out 
of Mexico. His family said he was being held in isolation after they 
received threats to his safety.

Weapon in question: Hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway

Civilian gun ownership is illegal 
under Mexican law unless the owner purchases the weapon from a special 
shop run by the country's Department of Defense.

'The Department of State warns all 
U.S. citizens against taking any type of firearm or ammunition into 
Mexico,' according to the website of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.

'Entering Mexico with a firearm, 
certain types of knives, or even a single round of ammunition is 
illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into Mexico 
unintentionally.'

Mexican law also bans shotguns with barrels of less than 25 inches. The family said Hammar's shotgun had a barrel of 24 inches.

Tourists are allowed to bring guns 
for hunting on rare occasions, but Mexican officials said all visitors 
must receive a special permit before entering the country.

Mexican 
customs agents do not issue gun permits. As a result, anyone crossing 
the border with a firearm or ammunition without a previously issued 
government permit is in instant violation of Mexican law, which 
stipulates long jail terms for breaking weapons laws.

Hammar said agents told him to fill out a form for his great-grandfather's gun.

But when the pair crossed the border 
and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and
 jailed the men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun.

A photograph released of Hammar while he was still being held captive showed him in a solitary cell,
 shirtless, barefoot and chained by handcuffs around his right ankle. He
 was sitting on an thin mattress with a red blanket in a room with 
chipped walls and a squalid floor. 

The email containing the photo was sent anonymously to Hammar's mother from a Yahoo.mx account.
