Jailed: Sgt Danny Nightingale was part of a crack counter-terrorism unit

The SAS hero jailed for keeping a pistol as a war trophy was part of a crack counter-terrorism unit known as the ‘Wheel of Death’, ordered by David Cameron to protect Britain from a Mumbai-style terrorist attack.

Sgt Danny Nightingale, 37, led a sniper team that was on 30-minute emergency standby at the height of a scare involving a plot to shoot civilians on the streets of a British city.

The specialist helicopter squad was briefed about its role after a meeting of the Government’s emergency committee, Cobra, chaired by the Prime Minister, in the summer of 2010.

According to court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, Sgt Nightingale was the ‘sniper co-ordinator of a fast-reaction counter-terrorism team’. It was described as the ‘Wheel of Death’ because of its high-stress combat role, rotating the SAS soldiers between counter-terrorism assignments and tours in Afghanistan and Somalia.

Sgt Nightingale’s supporters believe the non-commissioned officer, who served with valour in Iraq and Afghanistan, should never have been brought to trial after police found a pistol and ammunition in his Army accommodation.

His wife Sally, 38, with whom he  has two young children, has written to Mr Cameron asking him to intervene in the case. Downing Street sources say the Prime Minister sympathises with the soldier’s predicament.

This week his lawyers will ask the Court of Appeal to lift his ‘manifestly excessive’ 18-month prison sentence.

While in Iraq, Sgt Nightingale helped train a group of Iraqi special forces known as ‘the Apostles’, who presented him with a 9mm Glock pistol in recognition of his service.

He intended to have the weapon deactivated and presented to the regimental sergeants’ mess as a war trophy.

But
in November 2007, two members of his squadron were killed. Sgt 
Nightingale returned to the UK with the bodies of his friends after 
volunteering to help the bereaved families, while his equipment, 
including the pistol, was packed into a security box and returned to SAS
headquarters in Hereford.

This box was held in a secure cage at the Hereford base where Sgt Nightingale was stationed.

In the summer of 2010, British intelligence received warnings of a Mumbai-style terror plot against Britain, similar to the 2008 atrocity in India in which 174 people were killed during a 24-hour attack by ten gunmen.

Sgt Nightingale was assigned as a co-ordinator of the sniper team.

It was during his time with the unit that he was granted permission for a two-hour break to move his belongings from the box to his accommodation. This is when he is believed to have brought the pistol into an unsecured location, contrary to regulations.

His court martial was told: ‘It is extremely stressful, and it is hardly surprising... that you might not remember that you had in your possession this Glock gun.’

Next week SAS officers will give evidence in support of a reduction in Sgt Nightingale’s sentence. His legal team will be led by William Clegg QC, who represented Barry George, wrongly accused of murdering Jill Dando.
