Hospital waiting room magazines, surfaces and toilets are known to harbour germs.

But a new study has revealed a little-known germ hotspot: the hospital elevator button.

Research, conducted by physicians in Toronto, compared the amounts of bacteria living on 120 elevator buttons and 96 toilet surfaces at three hospitals.

The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of bacterial 
colonisation on lift buttons in large urban teaching hospitals.

Results: The presence of bacteria was 24 per cent higher around lift buttons than on toilet surfaces

To find out just how the dirty hospital surfaces were, researchers took samples from two interior buttons and two exterior buttons.

For the toilet surfaces, swabs were taken from the exterior and interior handles of the entry door, the privacy latch, and the toilet flusher.

They found that the prevalence of colonisation of elevator buttons was 61 per cent, while in and around toilet surfaces it was just 43 per cent.

Scientists said the kinds of bacteria most commonly found - Coagulase-negative staphylococci - had 'low pathogenicity,' so are unlikely to make people unwell.

But, patients may still be at risk from disease, they warned.

'Patients 
remain at potential risk of cross-contamination because of the frequent 
use of these buttons by diverse individuals,' the study authors wrote.

'In addition, a visitor is more likely to come into contact with an 
elevator button or a toilet than with inanimate hospital equipment and 
may transmit organisms if interacting with inpatients.'

Killer bugs: The study found superbugs, like MRSA, pictured, and C-difficile were among the infections lurking on the button panels

The researchers suggested placing more alcohol-based hand sanitisers in hospitals, specifically outside lifts, as they are effective for removing surface bacteria.

They also put forward the idea of enlarging elevator buttons to allow for elbow activation or installing touchless proximity sensors.

Increased public education about hand hygiene was also suggested.
