Billionaire Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has checked himself rehab, the team announced in a statement Tuesday afternoon.

The announcement comes just days after Irsay was arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of illegal prescription drugs following a traffic stop in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel on Sunday evening.

In the statement, the team thanks fans for their support and applauds Irsay's decision to seek help for what reportedly has been a long battle with prescription drug addiction.

'Yesterday, Jim Irsay took the first step toward regaining good health,' the team says in the statement.
 'He voluntarily checked into a highly-respected health care facility 
and is committed to undergoing the treatment and care necessary to help 
him meet his challenges head-on. Jim, the Irsay family, and the Colts 
organization are all deeply appreciative of the incredible outpouring of
 support and compassion from our fans and the Indiana community.'

Additionally, Irsay thanked supporters in a post on Twitter.

'Deepest
 thx to family, friends, fans, colleagues for the messages of support, 
thoughts and prayers. Impossible to tell u how much this means,' the NFL
 owner posted on the social networking website on Monday afternoon.

Friends say Irsay has been battling his drug problem for some time, and that his arrest could be a blessing in disguise.

'He's a sick, sick man,' one source told the Indy Star. 'He desperately needs help.'

According to the Indy Star Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances.

The night of his arrest, Irsay drove at a slow rate of speed, stopped in the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release.

'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said.

Myra Borshoff Cook, a spokeswoman for Irsay, declined to comment early Monday on his arrest.

In an inventory of Irsay's vehicle, 'multiple prescription drugs were discovered in pill bottles,' police said. 'These Schedule IV prescription drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles found in the vehicle.'

Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't drink...haven't in over 15 years.'

Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment.

Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay.

A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs.

League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would.

'The league's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel,' Aiello said.

Irsay, who lives in Carmel, became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Along the way, Jim Irsay held virtually every job from ball boy to general manager. Forbes magazine estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion.

Meg Irsay filed in November for divorce from her husband of 33 years, citing an 'irretrievable breakdown' of the marriage.

A joint statement issued by the couple said Jim Irsay would retain full ownership of the Colts and his other business interests.Â  The couple, who married in 1980, have been separated for a decade and are the parents of three adult daughters.

Since taking ownership of the team, Jim Irsay has made a reputation for himself by buying the scroll manuscript of Jack Kerouac's beat poem 'On the Road. 'for $2.43 million and often takes to Twitter to post comments ranging from the Colts' inner workings, popular music, and idle thoughts.

Irsay's next court appearance is scheduled for March 26.
