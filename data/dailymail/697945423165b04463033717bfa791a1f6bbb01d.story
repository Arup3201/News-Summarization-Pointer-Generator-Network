Whether they be Republicans, Democrats of independents, most Americans today believe the 113th Congress has been the worst in history.

A new poll conducted by CNN and ORC International also found that an even larger three-quarters of Americans believe this Congress has done nothing to address the country's problems.

'That sentiment exists among all demographic and political subgroups. Men, women, rich, poor, young, old - all think this year's Congress has been the worst they can remember,' CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. 'Older Americans - who have lived through more congresses - hold more negative views of the 113th Congress than younger Americans. Republicans, Democrats and independents also agree that this has been the worst session of Congress in their lifetimes.'

The 113th Congress is on track to be the least productive in the last four decades. Above, Congress meets to count the Electoral College in January 2009

While Congress did recently pass a budget to ensure the government won't shut down in the next two years, it has passed less than 60 bills into law.

Since next year is an election year, their rate of legislation is unlikely to escalate which means there's a very good chance this will be the least productive Congress in the last four decades.

And after that, Americans aren't really hoping for better. Both Republican and Democratic voters expressed their opinion in the poll that legislators on the other side of the aisle will move the country in the wrong direction.

Fifty-four per cent of Americans said that about Democrats, compared to the 54 per cent that said it about Republicans.

An equal  54 per cent said the same thing about President Obama.

The poll was conducted between December 16 and 19, and involved phone interviews with 1,036 adults across the U.S.
