Sebastian Vettel is testing with Ferrari for the first time since signing with the Formula One team.

The Gazzetta dello Sport reports that the German driver was at the wheel of an F2012 from two seasons ago at Ferrari's private Fiorano circuit.

It was announced last week that Vettel, who won four consecutive F1 titles at Red Bull, had signed a three-year deal with Ferrari to replace Fernando Alonso.

Vettel wore a white helmet that had the words, 'My first day at Ferrari' plus Saturday's date, written on it.

The 27-year-old faces a difficult challenge to restore Ferrari to prominence, with the Italian team having just concluded its first season without a win since 1993.

Vettel also struggled this year, finishing 217 points behind F1 champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes.
