If there was a World Cup for thighs Xherdan Shaqiri would already be beyond the last-16 as the Swiss hat-trick hero reaps the rewards for intensive rehabilitation work on his troublesome leg muscles.

His huge thighs even rival those of cycling legend Chris Hoy - whose upper legs each measure 27 inches in circumference.

Shaqiri has hit top form at the right time for Switzerland, scoring the tournament's second hat-trick as they beat Honduras 3-0 in their final group game to set up Tuesday's date with Argentina.

But it's been anything but a smooth build-up for the Bayern Munich midfielder, who suffered no less than three thigh tears last season.

He takes no
 chances in training even now, continuing to work intensively on 
strength and flexibility in a bid to avoid a repeat injury before Ottmar
 Hitzfeld's side is done in Brazil.

Switzerland are undoubted underdogs going into Monday's meeting with Argentina at Arena de Sao Paulo.

Lionel Messi has been in imperious form in the blue and white, but his dominance - the Barcelona star has scored four of his side's six goals - may be viewed as somewhat of a weakness.

The Swiss, despite Shaqiri's hat-trick, have five goalscorers in the tourament so far.
