It's one of the biggest shows ever made and one of the biggest acquisitions for streaming service Netflix.

But Friends was nowhere to be found on the website today despite it's long-advertised arrival telegraphed for January 1.

The much-loved sitcom was uploaded to the site as promised, it's just that no one could find it.

That's because it had been written into the Netflix search engine as F.R.I.E.N.D.S - the way it is fashioned in the show's opening credits - making it impossible to track down.

Where art thou?: Something of a Netflix search engine stuff up meant viewers were not able to track down Friends when all 10 seasons premiered on the streaming service on New Years Day

The issue became quite a headache for those nursing New Years Day hangovers and wanted some light watching of their favorite show, Gothamist reported.Â 

Some worked out they could search one of the actors that appear in the series, such as Jennifer Aniston, and Friends would come up.

Netflix has acquired all 10 seasons of the show, allowing 236 to be instantly streamed on their website.

So long as viewers can track it down.

Netflix hasn't commented on the search stuff up.

However the website seems to have reworked the configuration.

Friends is now able to be searched using normal spelling.
