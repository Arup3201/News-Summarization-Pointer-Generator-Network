A senior detective close to a phone-hacking probe tried to sell information to the News of the World including claims that former deputy prime minister John Prescott had been 'interfering' with the investigation, jurors were told today.

Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, is accused of offering the now-defunct tabloid information about Operation Varec, the investigation into whether Scotland Yard’s inquiry into phone hacking should be reopened.

She is accused of one count of misconduct in public office on September 11, 2010, which she denies.

On trial: Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn (left) has been accused of trying to sell information to the News of the World about a Met Police phone-hacking probe, including claims that former deputy prime minister John Prescott (right) was 'interfering' with the investigation

At that time, she was working in counter terrorism, managing the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit.

Today Southwark Crown Court was told that one of her team had been asked to carry out financial investigations as part of the Scotland Yard probe into phone hacking.

It is alleged that she rang the news desk of the tabloid at 7.51am that Saturday morning to offer information in exchange for payment.

The court heard that the call was taken by a journalist called Tim Wood, who was then a news editor for the NotW.

He said the caller refused to give her name, but introduced herself as a senior police officer.

Mr Wood told the jury: 'The one thing that stands out in my mind is the fact that she kept going on about Lord Prescott.

'Her
saying that he was pressing for them to put charges on the News of the 
World, and she was saying that she felt it was wrong that he was 
interfering in the scandal, so to speak, and she resented that.'

Claims: Casburn allegedly also told the news editor of the News of the World that six people were under investigation including former NotW editor Andy Coulson (left) and reporter Sean Hoare (right)

He added: 'She was almost justifying her call by saying that it was this interference by Prescott that had upset her.'

Mr
Wood sent an email to news editor Ian Edmondson and crime journalist 
Lucy Panton after the call to say that a police officer wanted 'to sell 
inside information' on the phone-hacking inquiry.

Casburn
told him that six people were under investigation including former NotW
editor Andy Coulson and reporter Sean Hoare, Mr Wood said.

She also mentioned that 'counter-terrorism assets' were being used in the probe, which was 'highly unusual'.

Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron said: 
'The prosecution says she sought to undermine a highly sensitive and 
high-profile investigation at the point of its launch.

'The
prosecution say, and it’s a matter for you 12, that the act of 
telephoning the News of the World to offer to sell information and the 
provision of some information during that call was misconduct, it was 
misconduct in public office.

'It
was a gross breach of the trust that the public places in a police 
officer not to disclose information on a current investigation in an 
unauthorised way, or to offer to do so in the future for payment.'

Charged: Casburn, 53, is accused of offering the now-defunct tabloid information about Operation Varec, the investigation into whether Scotland Yard’s inquiry into phone hacking should be reopened

The newspaper did not publish anything and no payment changed hands, the court heard.

The
court then heard from Detective Superintendent Christos Kalamatianos 
who led the 60-strong National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit.

He
said that his relationship with Casburn was 'cordial', but on one or 
two occasions she had accused him of failing to support her and the 
unit.

Later, Casburn sobbed in the dock as a colleague gave evidence against her.

The
53-year-old was seen taking her glasses off so she could dab her eyes 
with tissue as she listened to Detective Superintendent Christos 
Kalamatianous talk about the terror unit she used to run at Scotland 
Yard.

Mr Justice Fulford 
paused proceedings at Southwark Crown Court after noticing Casburn, who 
has been suspended from the force, was 'distressed.'

Accused: It is alleged Casburn rang the news desk of the tabloid at its offices in Wapping (above) at 7.51am one Saturday morning to offer information in exchange for payment

Det Supt Kalamatianous said Casburn, who he line managed, said on occasion she felt unsupported by him and the unit, but that they always seemed to resolve matters.

Previously the court heard she felt 
bullied at work and was going through a divorce and failed adoption 
proceedings at the time she made the call on September 11, 2010.

He said: 'I believe I was managing her sensitively, I don't know that I was managing her well.'

Casburn had no desk for some time, jurors were told, despite more junior officers having them.

However Mr Kalamatianos said his relationship with her was not hostile and he supported her application for promotion.

Detective Chief Superintendent Dean Haydon, who led Operation Varec in September 2010, told the court how the investigation was set up following allegations linked to phone hacking made in an article in the New York Times.

He said he was initially following seven lines of inquiry: the editor of the New York Times and the journalist who wrote the article, and six former journalists, Coulson, Hoare, Sharon Marshall, Brendan Montague, Ross Hall and Paul McMullan.

An investigator from Casburn's unit was asked to check financial records for the six to make sure officers had the correct address for each of them.

They were also asked to look at whether Mr Hoare received payment for the New York Times article, although this line of inquiry was discontinued.

Mr Haydon said the work for the investigator would have been 'minimal' and he would have been 'very surprised' had Casburn raised concerns about resources.

When asked in cross-examination whether the counter-terrorism unit was investigating 'active plots' at the time, he said: 'There are always active investigations being led by the command into terrorism-related activity.'

He also told jurors that one financial investigator on Operation Varec admitted he had been at a dinner party with a journalist who worked for the Sun, and had discussed phone hacking.

The investigator was then removed from the team.

Dressed in a navy skirt suit, tights and high heels, Casburn struggled to compose herself in the afternoon of the first day of her trial, which is expected to last four days.

Casburn, from Hatfield Peverel, Essex, admits making the phone call, but denies asking for money, and says she had reasonable excuse.

She says she was concerned that resources that were supposed to be used to combat terrorism were being allocated to the phone hacking investigation and that much of the information was already public knowledge.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
