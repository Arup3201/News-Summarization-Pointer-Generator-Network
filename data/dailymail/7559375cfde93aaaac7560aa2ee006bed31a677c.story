A massive search is underway for four young siblings who police believe were snatched by their allegedly abusive parents after they bonded out of jail.

The sisters, one-year-old Mendy, two-year-old Evelin, five-year-old Jackelyn and six-year-old Kimberly, were last seen at their home in Canton, Mississippi on September 7. 

The girls had been put into state protective custody after their mother and stepfather were arrested on abuse and neglect charges but authorities believe the couple took them after being released. 

'We have every reason to believe the children are in danger,' Canton Assistant Police chief Juan Cloy said.   

Fears: Four sisters, including one-year-old Mendy Coria-Coronado (left) and two-year-old Evelin Fernanda Coria-Coronado (right), are missing from their Mississippi home. Cops believe they were taken by their parents

Where are they? Jackelyn Belinda Gomez-Coronado, five (left) and Kimberly Elizabeth Gomez-Coronado, six (right), have also been missing from the home in Canton since September 12

He said they were desperate to get the girls away from their stepfather, 24-year-old Fernando Coria-Pelay, who was charged with felony child abuse in May.

The girls' mother, 28-year-old Sonia Elisabeth Coronado, had been charged with felony child neglect in the case and had agreed to testify against her partner.  

'We want to get him away from the children,' Cloy said of the stepfather.

Madison county District Attorney Michael Guest told Mississippi News Now that the prosecutor said the children had suffered the 'worst physical abuse marks she's ever seen'. 

'These children were severely beaten at the hands of [Pelay] not to the point where they required hospitalization, but well and beyond the type of necessary discipline for a 5-6 year old,' Guest said. 

Wanted: The girls' stepfather Fernando Coria-Pelay, left, and their mother Sonia Elisabeth Coronado, right, are believed to have taken them after leaving jail earlier this month. Pelay had been ordered not to contact them

After the children vanished on September 7, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation issued a missing and endangered child alert for them on September 12. 

Cloy said Canton police have issued kidnapping warrants for Coria-Pelay and Coronado, but he would not say whether investigators believe the family is still in Mississippi. 

Investigators added that authorities had granted temporary custody of the children to the mother, and a no contact order had been in place to keep Fernando Pelayo away.

Their case was due to go to trial next month. 

The girls' full names are: Kimberly Elizabeth Gomez-Coronado (aged six), Jackelyn Belinda Gomez-Coronado (five), 2-year-old Evelin Fernanda Coria-Coronado (two) and Mendy Coria-Coronado (one).

Last seen: The girls were last seen at their home in Canton, Mississippi on this road on September 7

All were born in the United States, while their mother is from Guatemala and the stepfather is from Mexico. Authorities did not release the whereabouts of their biological father(s).

Canton police are working with state and federal investigators and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on the case, Cloy said. 

If you have information regarding the whereabouts of the girls or their parents, contact Investigator Eilarene Walker with the Canton Police Department at 601-859-2121.
