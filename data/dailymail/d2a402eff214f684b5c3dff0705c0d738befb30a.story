Accused: Thortsen Rushing, 18, allegedly shot his father and younger brother in their home

An 18-year-old high school senior accused of murdering his father and younger brother carried out the killings to get survivor benefits, court records suggest.

A tearful Thorsten Rushing had initially claimed that he saw two masked intruders shoot dead his father, Uwe Rushing, and 14-year-old brother Stefan at their home in Lawton, Oklahoma in January before scaring them away by grabbing a shotgun and firing.

But his story quickly unraveled when investigators realized the trajectory of the bullets did not match his story and three of his four alleged accomplices - his school friends - confessed to the plot.

A week after the January 20 killings, Thorsten Rushing was arrested on murder and conspiracy charges, but authorities have never released a motive.

Now a subpoena filed in the case has suggested that Rushing, who had recently turned 18, could have been trying to get his hands on a life insurance payout, The Oklahoman reported.

In February, Comanche County Assistant 
District Attorney Mark Stoneman asked for records relating to 
Uwe Rushing's job at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, 
specifically 'all documents related to survivor benefits', the publication reported.

Thorsten Rushing
 and four co-defendants - Ethan Thompson, 19, Wesley Bankston, 18, Cody 
Davis, 19, and Timothy Delahoy, 18 - are to attend preliminary hearings this month. Rushing's is scheduled for Wednesday.

He allegedly carried out the killings on January 20 before calling 911 at 2.35am, claiming he was sleeping in the living room when two men broke in and started shooting, killing his dad and brother.

The brothers' mother, who had struggled with a drug problem, did not live at the home and had reportedly not had contact with her sons for nine years.

Autopsy reports said Stefan Rushing was
 shot three times in the head and face and then suffocated when he didn't bleed to death fast enough, police said.

Their 50-year-old father died of gunshots to the chest and head, the autopsy found.

Arrested: 19-year-old Ethan Thompson, left, allegedly hid in the closet for hours until after the shooting and then drove the murder weapon from the scene with 18-year-old Wesley Bankston, right

'Plot': Timothy Delahoy, left, and Cody Davis, right, had allegedly been part of an earlier attempt to kill the father and younger brother three days prior but after it failed, they both backed out

Police said they believe Rushing was the only one who pulled the trigger but that Thompson, Davis and Delahoy confessed to 
their involvement in the plot.

Thompson allegedly hid in a closet for 
hours until after the shooting, while Bankston allegedly drove Thompson 
and the murder weapon from the scene - which led to their first-degree murder charges.

Three days before the murder, Davis had donned a black hooded sweater to break in - but Uwe Rushing saw him as he went outside and pulled out a pistol, scaring the man away.

Davis was allegedly going to take the gun from Thorsten Rushing after he shot his family before driving away with Delahoy, but after the scare, both men backed out, authorities said.

Instead, Thortsen and two of his friends carried out the plan three days later, police said.

Scene: Thorsten Rushing had claimed he was sleeping in the living room when two men broke in and opened fire, killing his father and brother. He said he scared them off after grabbing a shotgun

All of the men are charged 
with two counts of conspiracy. Thompson and Bankston face 
two counts of first-degree murder, while Davis and Delahoy face two counts
 of being an accessory after the fact.

The arrests shocked the comfortable town perched between Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City and came after a week of arduous detective work from the Lawton Police Department.

'From what we understand, they were smart kids,' Lawson police Captain Captain Craig Akard told KSWO after the arrests. 'They were polite kids.'

Stephen Jones, an attorney representing Thorsten Rushing, said his client will be entering a plea of not guilty.
