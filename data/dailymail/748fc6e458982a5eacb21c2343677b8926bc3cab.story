Vogue magazine has sparked international outrage after publishing a photograph of a 'beaten-up' model.

The image, in this month's edition of Vogue Italia, was an attempt at making a political statement against domestic violence, the publication claimed.

But critics have blasted the fashion shoot for 'glamourising' violence against women.

Outrage: This image of a woman bleeding and strewn across the floor in Vogue Italia has enraged readers

The photograph shows a model in a Prada dress sprawled upside down at the bottom of a flight of stairs, blood streaming into her hair, as a blood-splattered man looks on from an armchair.

Other images in the violence-themed edition show a girl in a Prada dress screaming as a man approaches her with blood on his hands.

Another girl hides in a cupboard, with a man leaning over brandishing shears.

And in one, the model looks petrified crouching under the stairs as a man descends.

Outraged Twitter users attacked the 'poor taste' shoot.

One user wrote: 'Vogue Italia is repulsively glamourising domestic violence. It makes me very angry.'

Critics advised Vogue editors to meet victims of violence before publishing a violence-themed edition

Another said: 'God. Terrible. I can't quite believe we're seeing it.'

One said: 'There is nothing glamorous about domestic violence. Anyone who thinks there is need to speak to victims simple.'

One simply wrote: 'Unacceptable'.

Anticipating the outrage, editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, wrote: 'It doesn't matter if we run the risk of causing a general uproar with the media or arousing criticism; or if we are accused of exploiting pressing issues just to push our way in newsstands.

'What is important for us is that at least one of the dozens of women suffering violence every day can feel our nearness.

Political statement: In a forward, editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, pictured with Courtney Love, defended the edition as a political statement in support of women who have been subjected to domestic abuse

'And that those who follow us may feel stimulated to take action, condemn, and support women in trouble.

'And that they all see that all of us at "Vogue Italia" are on their side: by utterly and radically condemning all types of violence. This awareness urges us to make some noise. In our own way.'

It is not the first time Ms Sozzani has courted controversy in her tenure as Vogue Italia editor.

She was the first magazine editor to produce an edition featuring only black models, and later sparked outrage by labelling large gold hoops 'slave earrings'.
