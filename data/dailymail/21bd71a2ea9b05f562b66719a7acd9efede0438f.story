Ched Evans, 25, is set to meet officials from Sheffield United when he is allowed on day release in July with a view to signing a three-year deal in October

Disgraced footballer Ched Evans is set to sign a new deal with his former club when he is on day release from prison this summer.

The 25-year-old, who is serving a five-year sentence for rape, will hold talks with officials from Sheffield United in July with a view to signing a £3million deal for the club after his full release in October.

The Welsh striker was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales.

But it is 
understood that officials from the club, including manager Nigel Clough, have
 visited him in during his sentence at HM Wymott in Lancashire and have discussed his 
future at the League One side.

The prospect of him returning has sparked an angry reaction from a group of supporters who say it would be a 'humiliation'.

Almost 60,000 have signed a petition addressed to Kevin McCabe, the club's chairman, urging him not to resign Evans.

An extract reads: 'For the male leaders of the club to endorse him and "welcome him back" is an absolute humiliation to all women who expect the men who commit gross acts of violence against women to pay for what they have done and part of that is relinquishing the celebrity they attained, and in this case used as a tool to facilitate the violence.

'The clear message to young boys and men is that you will be forgiven for this crime. Women will not be believed when they accuse you of that crime even if a court believes them.

'The 
message given is that men who commit such atrocious crimes will suffer 
only a small penance whilst the women they attack suffer for the rest of
 their lives.'

One
 supporter wrote: 'I want to feel safe in a city that takes a strong 
stance against sexual assault, not a city that ignores and rewards it.'

Evans is suspected to be allowed out 
on day release from July and will be forced to wear an electronic ankle 
tag during his provisional contract negotiations.

A source told the Mirror that Evans has been training hard in prison and the terms will be agreed if his fitness levels are good enough.

Evans was found guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court of raping a woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales, in April 2012.

He admitted having sex but has ­always claimed it was consensual.

One of his appeals has already been overturned, but his legal team are planning on submitting another proposal so his case can be heard again.

Former Port Vale and Walsall defender Clayton McDonald, also admitted having sex with the same woman but was cleared of rape charges.

Evans was transferred to Sheffield United in 2009 from Manchester City for £3million.

A spokesman for Sheffield United said they would not be commenting on the allegations.
