Probes: Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered further investigations into the standards of care at several trusts

More than 3,000 patients have died ‘unexpectedly’ in just five NHS trusts in the past two years.

The five are among nearly 20 hospitals facing inspections over concerns that thousands of patients are dying needlessly, it was revealed last night.

David Cameron has ordered an investigation into standards of care at trusts where death rates are persistently high.

In addition, he outlined plans for performance-related pay for doctors, nurses and managers based on their level of care.

He made the announcements on the day the author of the report into one of the Stafford hospital scandals warned a similar outrage could happen again.

The five hospitals which will be inspected are Basildon and Thurrock, Colchester, Tameside, Blackpool and East Lancashire, where death rates have been persistently high over the past two years.

Officials would not confirm which other hospitals face inspections, but over the past year a total of 20 trusts have been found to have high death rates. They include Wye Valley, Aintree University Hospitals, Mid Cheshire Hospitals, Northern Lincolnshire and Goole and Hull and East Yorkshire.

Mr Cameron told the Commons: ‘I have asked the NHS medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, to conduct an immediate investigation into the care of hospitals with the highest mortality rates, and to check that urgent remedial action is being taken.

'The way Robert Francis (the report’s author) chronicles the evidence of systemic failure means we cannot say with confidence that failings of care are limited to one hospital.’

At risk: Ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at Stafford Hospital (pictured) and Cannock Chase Hospital are 'dotted around' the NHS

Mr Cameron also took the unprecedented
step of apologising to the families of patients who suffered ‘horrific 
abuse’ at the trust.

He said: ‘This public inquiry not only
repeats earlier findings but also shows wider systemic failings . . . 
so I would like to go further as Prime Minister and apologise to the 
families of all those who have suffered for the way that the system 
allowed such horrific abuse to go unchecked and unchallenged for so 
long.

‘On behalf of the Government – and indeed our country – I am truly sorry.’

Mr Cameron announced that hospital 
chief executives and chairmen could be sacked if patients say their 
trust’s care is poor. At present, senior managers are usually sacked 
only if their trust gets into debt or if they miss targets.

The Prime Minister also confirmed that
healthcare assistants – untrained nurses – would be subject to new 
minimum standards and better training. This autumn, he will appoint a 
chief inspector of hospitals who will be responsible for checking they 
are clean, safe and caring, in the same way as schools inspectors check 
educational standards.

Mr Cameron said: ‘We need a hospital 
inspection regime that doesn’t just look at numeric targets, but makes a
judgment about the quality of care.’

In addition, Mr Cameron has appointed 
MP Ann Clwyd – whose husband suffered appalling care – to investigate 
the NHS’s complaints system.

Mr Francis said the Mid Staffordshire 
scandal was not an ‘event of such rarity or improbability’, and he could
not ‘assume that it has not been and will not be repeated’.

Debate: David Cameron spoke in the House of Commons about the public inquiry into failings at Stafford Hospital

Christine Green, chief executive of 
Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said she looked forward to 
receiving Sir Bruce’s team, adding it was ‘well recognised’ that the 
trust’s death rate had been elevated for the past two years.

Miss Green said: ‘Over recent years 
the hospital has undertaken an extensive quality improvement programme, 
which has seen significant quality gains across a wide range of other 
clinical indicators including hospital infections, falls, deep vein 
thrombosis screening and pressure ulcers.’

A spokesman for Basildon and Thurrock 
University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said they were committed to 
improving mortality rates, with all hospital deaths reviewed to identify
any lessons that can be learned.

Doctors, nurses and NHS managers should face jail for failing to tell the truth, the report states.

It calls for new honesty rules to ensure staff don’t try to cover up their mistakes, as routinely happened at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust.

Robert Francis QC also wants failed 
managers to be ‘blacklisted’ to prevent them being rehired at other 
hospitals and nurses to face annual ‘compassion’ checks.

In total, he set out 290 recommendations to ‘change the culture’ of the NHS to ensure the mistakes of Mid Staffordshire could not happen again.

The measures include appointing a dedicated ‘older people’s’ nurse at hospitals and banning the practice of patients being discharged at night.

He also calls for future nurses to undergo personality checks before being enrolled on courses, to ensure they were capable of caring for patients.

The report also demands a ban on gagging clauses, under which NHS staff are bribed with tens of thousands of pounds to stop them speaking out about poor care. The Care Quality Commission would also carry out ‘honesty checks’ during routine inspections of hospitals.

Officials would ask patients and relatives if they felt staff were being open with them, and trusts or wards would be given a score. If staff were found to be covering up their mistakes they could face prosecution.

Nurses who worked at Mid Staffordshire have revealed how they were threatened with physical violence for raising their concerns. One, Helene Donnelly, 34, told the inquiry how she was afraid to go to her car at night in case she was attacked by another staff member.

Giving evidence in 2011, she spoke of two senior nurses, the ward sisters, who ruled the A&E unit with fear: ‘The staff were scared of the sisters and afraid to speak out about the poor standards of care patients were receiving.’

Last night Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was looking ‘very sympathetically’ at the call for criminal sanctions for NHS workers who covered up bad care.
