A fun-loving family is creating a massive 130ft-long waterslide in their back garden after buying it from a local leisure centre for just £50.

Rachel Betts is making the huge flume for her two boys Oscar, 2, and six-month-old Oakley. Once completed, it will snake all the way around their two acre garden.

The 26-year-old was given the enormous slide by her father Paul, who saw it being dismantled at his local leisure centre in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where it had been used for 20 years.

He paid just £50 for the pipes, then the family spent a week carting them 25 miles across country to their home using a truck, trailer and lorry.

She plans to use it as a slide all year round, but will place a paddling pool at the end  during summer

Rachel and her family have already constructed half the slide, which comes in 18 three-metre pieces.

They hope to eventually create a treehouse at the end of the garden, with the slide spiralling out of it.

'I was absolutely shocked when dad said he had bought the waterslide, but I thought it would be brilliant to have in the garden,' said Rachel Betts, from the village of Stonham Aspal in Suffolk.

'It was very tricky to get all the pieces here as they are so big and heavy, but we managed to use our truck and hire an articulated lorry.

'We're planning to use it as a slide most of the year round, but we may put a paddling pool at the bottom in the summer and use a pump to get water flowing through.

'Oscar is really excited about it and we're looking forward to it too. We're all big kids.'

Her father Paul said he saw the slide being taken apart and thrown on the skip and thought it would be fun to rescue it.

'We have often used the slide over the years and when I was taking my youngest daughter swimming when I noticed them breaking it up,' he said.

'I offered to have it and we ended up having 90 per cent of the black slide. Rachel's lucky to have a big garden and it fits in well and the children will be able to have amazing fun.'

The waterslide, which he bought for only £50, was taken to his home in pieces then constructed on-site

St Edmundsbury Borough Council said the slide was being removed as it had come to the end of its 'natural life'

The family has already been taking it in turns to try out the slide.

Rachel's brother Shaun, 24, who remembers using the slide when it was at the leisure centre, said: 'We've all had a go on it - apart from nan and gran. It still needs a few improvements but we're getting there.'

A spokesman for St Edmundsbury Borough Council spokesman said: 'The old flume had come to the end of its natural life, having undergone several repairs in the past.

'We are investing approximately £170,000 in a new flume which should be in place by early next year.

'As we understand it, the builder was approached by a member of the public who asked if he could take a few sections of the old flume to use as a feature in his garden.

'It would have cost money to put it into landfill and so the builder agreed that the man could take sections.'
