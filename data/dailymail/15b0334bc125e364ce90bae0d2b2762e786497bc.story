Jailed: Andrew Harris, 45, charges swingers £40 to continue conversations with alluring, 'open-minded' couples on a fake casual sex site

The creator of a fake swingers website stole more than £200,000 from people looking for casual sex.

Andrew Harris, 45, conned hundreds of victims for four years by charging them £40 to access 'titilating' but fake profiles.

But, afraid to risk exposing their fetishes, users were too embarrassed to complain.

Finally, after a man contacted trading standards, Harris was today jailed for two years.

The user - known as TB - told Birmingham Crown Court he and his partner were surprised at the number of 'open-minded' people on the remote island of Anglesey.

'Anglesey is not renowned for its swinging scene,' the court heard.

After exchanging a few messages with a number of contacts, the couple were blocked and ordered to pay a subscription fee to continue.

They did - but the interested users suddenly disappeared without trace.

Fearing a scam, TB set up a different profile and received exactly the same messages from the same people.

He contacted Birmingham Trading Standards.

Judge Simon Drew told Harris, who owns Zilet Ltd software company: 'This case is a large scale fraud and involves a large number of vulnerable victims.

'Although you sought to dupe them of relatively small sums of £40 each, they were very, very unlikely to complain beyond the limited scope of others with similar interests on the Internet.

'They were very unlikely to complain because of that embarrassment factor of having their sexual interests examined by the authorities and other people.

The businessman, who runs a software company, was caught after four years when a user in Anglesey was surprised by the number of swingers on the remote island - who disappeared when he paid the fee

'Further more, this was long term running for at least four years and sophisticated because it involved clever use of the website.'

Mr Mark Jackson, prosecuting, said a council enforcement officer set a trap for Harris by signing up to the 'free service'.

The officer received messages from the same people who had contacted TB, including Kitten, who boasted of her 'personal attributes'.

Sentence: Birmingham Crown Court heard Harris's scheme was calculated and clever, charging little for something users would be too embarrassed to complain about. He was ordered to pay more than £60,000

Byron Broadstock, defending, said the site started off as a legitimate business and it involved lots of genuine profiles.

It was not a case of people getting nothing for their money, he added.

The judge fined the company £42,000 and ordered it to pay £21,358 costs.
