When Guus Hiddink started his second spell in charge of the Dutch national team on August 1, the whole nation was basking in the warm Oranje afterglow of a third-place finish at the World Cup in Brazil.

Now, just 73 days on and Hiddink is already in danger of being frozen out following Monday night's abject Euro 2016 qualifying defeat in Iceland.

Former players and supporters rounded on Hiddink following the 2-0 loss at the Laugardalsvollur Stadium, Holland's second loss in three qualifiers so far.

The warm reception received by former boss Louis van Gaal and his team following their third-place finish at the World Cup in Brazil seems a distant memory 

Ronald de Boer's comments were the most frosty, the former midfielder saying Hiddink was 'done' as a coach with his 'old-fashioned' ideas.

While the expansion of the European Championship, with as many as three teams from each group getting through, means Holland surely can't fail to make it to France, the positive feeling left behind by Louis van Gaal has soon disappeared.

That mesmerising 5-1 rout of Spain in their opening World Cup game and the 3-0 defeat of Brazil in the third-place play-off already seem a distant memory, with Hiddink having lost as many competitive matches in two months as Van Gaal lost in his entire two spells in charge.

Qualification for tournaments is usually a formality for the Dutch but they were a pale shadow of their usual selves in Iceland, succumbing to two goals from in-form Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson.

The defeat in Iceland made the front page of De Telegraaf on Tuesday morning, but for all the wrong reasons

The front page of Metro featured Robin van Persie, Jasper Cillessen and Bruno Martins Indi looking dejected 

Having lost 2-0 to Italy in a September friendly, Hiddink's side were defeated 2-1 by the Czech Republic in their first qualifier before recovering some pride with a 3-1 win over lowly Kazakhstan in Eindhoven on Friday.

But the lacklustre performance in Iceland exposed flaws in Hiddink's plan that simply weren't there under Van Gaal, now at Manchester United.

'I think Guus Hiddink doesn't really have a game plan in my eyes,' said De Boer, a pundit on Sky Sports, who believes Ronald Koeman, now at Southampton, was the right choice to succeed Van Gaal.

'He doesn't show the guys 'this is the way we want to go'. I want to see, for example, running midfielders supporting [Robin] Van Persie. I don't see any of this.

Dutch legend Ronald de Boer, seen here at the 1998 World Cup, said Hiddink's methods were 'old fashioned'

De Boer suggested that Ronald Koeman, now at Southampton, should have been offered the post 

'There's plenty of games to play and change it around. But the pressure will be enormous now for Guus because there was criticism for his nomination beforehand.

'Of course he has a great record. His ideas now are old-fashioned.'

Those who watched the game from the stands and on television weren't impressed either. The official Dutch supporters' club was inundated with emails criticising the manager following the defeat.

Its president Theo Pouw told De Telegraaf that 'disappointment and anger were great, with some writing Guus Hiddink should leave.'

With Holland trailing both Iceland and the Czech Republic in the Group A standings - and just one point ahead of Latvia - there is already a little bit of pressure in what should have been a straightforward qualification process.

Arjen Robben struggled to make an impression on the match in Iceland as Holland slipped to defeat

Arjen Robben was among the senior players who admitted the performance wasn't good enough.

'This was not worthy of Oranje,' the Bayern Munich star told NOS.

'But we did it all ourselves. We need to look at ourselves. We made things unnecessarily hard for ourselves.

'Now I have to be careful what I say because I'm so angry. We shouldn't point fingers at each other, but what happened tonight shouldn't at this level. If you play like this, you don't win games.'

While you sense Robben wanted to make a point about Hididnk's leadership, Van Persie defended the under-fire manager.

When it was put to him that Hiddink, initially manager of the team between 1995 and 1998, has had a negative impact on the Dutch camp, the Man United striker replied: 'That's not fair.

Holland are third in Group A, behind Iceland and the Czech Republic, but should still qualify for Euro 2016

Robin van Persie defended Hiddink and his methods after the match, calling him a 'fantastic coach'

'He's a fantastic coach. We worked hard to get here in as good shape as possible. Iceland were looking for our mistakes.

'I still have hope. Nothing is decided yet, but there's a lot of work to do. We'll do anything. We don't give up.'

Holland would have expected to be sitting pretty at the top of their group by now but now next month's qualifier at home to Latvia becomes a must-win match.

Lose it and Hiddink's Oranje encore could be short and far from sweet.

With temperatures hovering just above freezing point at the Laugardalsvollur Stadium, seven of the Holland players donned gloves for the first time this winter.

In addtion to goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen, Gregory van der Wiel, Arjen Robben, Ibrahim Affelay, Nigel de Jong, Wesley Sneijder and Jermain Lens all sported black gloves.

Daley Blind, Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij all braved the cold temperatures without gloves and in short sleeves, while captain Robin van Persie wore long sleeves but no gloves.

By contrast, none of the Iceland team were in gloves apart from the keeper.
