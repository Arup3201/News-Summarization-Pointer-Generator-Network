A Moscow oligarch whose attempted killers were allegedly fingered by the banker shot in London has claimed Russian 'terrorism' has arrived on Britain's streets.

Alexander Antonov spoke out in support of German Gorbuntsov, 45, now in a coma after being gunned down in a suspected contract killing attempt last Tuesday.

Shortly before the attack the wounded banker had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia-style assassination bid against Mr Antonov, a key figure in the Converse Bank empire.

At one point, the Russian authorities 
regarded Mr Gorbuntsov as a possible suspect because of an alleged 
$106million debt owed by Mr Antonov to Gorbuntsov.

Yesterday, 61-year-old Mr Antonov claimed that he and Mr Gorbuntsov had 'normal' and even 'friendly' relations.

'He was not a part of the 
assassination attempt. He had some information about how it was 
prepared, and wanted to pass it on, that's it,' he said.

Asked why Mr Gorbuntsov had been 
targeted, he said: 'Perhaps because the people who did it were very 
scared of this information getting publicly known, specially given that,
as I understood, German was adamant in his decision to make it public.

'So they went as far in the centre of 
the legal world - I consider London to be the capital of the legal world
- in prime time, to carry out this slaughter.'

He stressed: 'My personal attitude to 
it is that it simply beggars belief, it beggars belief. How can you sort
business issues by such methods? It is terrorism. It is simply 
terrorism.

'But I think the fact that it happened
in London does give hope to believe that Russian and British law 
enforcement systems would together discover who did it, and get the 
b******s.'

Asked if he agreed that the two men 
named by Mr Gorbuntsov to Russian prosecutors - Pyotr Chuvilin and Sergei 
Mendeleyev - as being behind the Mr Antonov assassination attempt, were 
indeed involved.

'I'm scared to give the positive 
answer to that, is it up to the investigation and the court to establish
it. But they can be somewhere there. Nearby. '

Asked if Russians were behind the crime, he said: 'I agree.'

Asked whether he would now feel safe coming to London, he said: 'Well, what do you do? You've got to keep living. '

Gorbuntsov's testimony appeared to give the missing link in establishing who ordered the attack against Antonov.

Gorbuntsov's lawyer Vadim Vedenin has 
admitted in the Mr Antonov case that his client was initially 'suspected in
organising this attempt on his life', because he was present at the 
meeting where property claims to the Antonov family were talked about 
and where the Antonovs were threatened.

'This is true, he was present there, 
we do not deny it. But still he is not in anyway related to the attempt 
on his life itself.'

Alexander Antonov, father of former Portsmouth FC owner Vladimir Antonov, lost the use of an arm after a 2009 assassination bid in Moscow.

Three Chechen men were convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison on long sentences a year later, but police never identified the mastermind.

The same gang was convicted of killing Ruslan Yamadayev, rivals to hardman Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Kremlin-backed president.

Ex-Russian MP Yamadayev was gunned down in his car close to the British Embassy in Moscow in September 2008.

His brother Sulim, a Kadyrov enemy, was shot dead in Dubai in March 2009 by men using a gold-plated pistol.

In November 2006 Russian dissident Alexander 
Litvinenko (pictured above) was murdered in London.

British
prosecutors have named his fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the 
main suspect in his poisoning with radioactive polonium-210.

However, the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK.'

The lawyer stressed: 'He clearly said he had nothing to do with the attempt on Antonov's life.'

It has also emerged Mr Gorbuntsov was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain for himself and his family.

The financier's business visa, which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008, expires next year.

It is thought the 45-year-old feared he would be forced to return to Russia and into the clutches of his many enemies.

He said recently: ‘If I go back to 
Russia, they will kill me.’ Last night Mr Gorbuntsov was under armed 
guard in hospital after being hit up to six times.

With
the would-be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the 
safety of Mr Gorbuntsov’s wife Larisa, 46, and son. Mrs Gorbuntsov flew 
to London to be at her husband’s bedside while their 25-year-old son 
Vladislav is seeking a visa to come to Britain.

Scotland
Yard yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the 
shooting to come forward. Mr Gorbuntsov was shot after being dropped off
by taxi at his apartment block next to Canary Wharf on Tuesday evening.

The
banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City 
earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just 
stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The 
hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot.

A
young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the 
mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services 
arrived.

Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer also said the banker had been planning to submit a 
political asylum request to stay within days. A successful asylum claim 
would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on 
allegations of embezzlement.

There
was also an apparent financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways, 
whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin.

An estimated £415million 
was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank 
whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.
