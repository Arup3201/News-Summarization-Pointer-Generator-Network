Take a trip back in time for a tour of bustling Chicago at the peak of the 1940s.

This rare colour footage showing the Windy City some 70 years ago, was discovered by chance at an estate sale in the Auburn Gresham district by professional film and video colorist Jeff Altman.

Mr Altman, a former Chicago resident who recently moved to New York, decided to take a gamble after the dusty old canister caught his eye among other items at the sale this fall.Â

He had no idea what was on the film and the only clues were two labels reading 'Chicago' and 'Print 1', but he decided to take a chance and shell out $40 to take it home.

And the gamble certainly paid off, as he was delighted to discover it contained hundreds of historical clips of his hometown and best of all they were in stunning color.

The film was produced by the Chicago Board of Education with help from United Airlines and is accompanied by a traditional 1940s-style voice over.

'Chicago, a city of beauty, strength and power', it declares. 'Chicago, commercial capital of the nation, agricultural market and industrial center of the world. Chicago, the most American of American cities.'

Mr Altman, 27, told the website dnainfo.com: 'I was curious. so I picked it up, and it turned out to be pretty cool.'

The 32 minutes of footage shows scenes from all parts of the city including beaches, parks, factories, sporting events, universities and numerous views of downtown.

It depicts a city in transformation, ready to embrace the modern age.

One moment an old steam train creaks down the rails pulling a load of dirty old tankers, the next a gleaming new diesel locomotive is seen rolling out of Central Station.

Another scene shows hundreds of people packed onto one of the city's beaches to enjoy a sunny day.

A marquee which appears to be for the 1945 Humphrey Bogart film 'Conflict', helps to date the footage.

The film's narrator Johnnie Neblett died on September 15, 1946, and John Howatt, credited on the film as Chicago Board of Education's business manager, was elected to the post on january 8, 1945, which suggests the film must have been first released sometime between those two dates.

Mr Altman transferred the film digitally and tweaked the colours slightly which he deemed to be a little too pink.

After tightening up the focus he uploaded the film onto the internet where it has been warmly received.

The Chicago Board of Education is now trying to find out more about the film such as why it was made and who it was shown to.

Mr Altman said the film was unusual as it ventures beyond Downtown into areas where visitors wouldn't likely go, like the steel plants in South Shore.

He added: 'Back then, travel films were very popular; they'd be shown before your mainstream movies. This seems a bit different, which I thought was very interesting.'
