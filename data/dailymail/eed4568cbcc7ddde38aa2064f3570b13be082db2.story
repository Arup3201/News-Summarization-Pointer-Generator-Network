Shocking CCTV footage has captured the moment a knife-wielding teenager realises he is a murderer.

Edward Redman, 18, is shown laughing and joking in the footage, filmed after he brutally attacked tragic 17-year-old Jay Whiston in September 2012.

The footage shows Redman's mood suddenly changing as he puts his hand to his mouth, the moment police believe he was told that Mr Whiston had died from his wounds.

After putting his hand to his mouth, Redman leans over and shows his accomplice, Rhys Hennebry, a message on his phone

Redman, pictured in the red top, stabbed Mr Whiston at a party in Colchester, Essex which had been advertised on Facebook and Twitter.

Redman and his friend Rhys Hennebry, 19, who is also shown in the footage, fled the party after the attack.

About 90 minutes later, they were seen running for a bus and, after getting on, Redman receives a message, which he shows to Hennebry before putting his hand over his mouth in shock.

Redman then made a series of frantic phone calls and text messages, the details of which were later deleted from his phone.

The CCTV footage was released after Hennebry was yesterday locked up for his role in Jay’s murder. He was sent to a young offenders’ institution for three years on two charges of affray.

During the pair's trials, Chelmsford Crown Court heard the party had been well organised until a number of uninvited guests, including Redman, arrived.

CCTV footage was released after Rhys Hennebry, 19, pictured, was yesterday jailed for his role in the murder.

The jury heard that Redman and his friends 'spread an air of fear' and told party goers that they were 'tooled up'.

A
 confrontation then developed when one of Redman's associates attempted 
to steal alcohol from Mr Whiston's friends, the court heard.

Redman stabbed Mr Whiston inside the house before following him onto the street where he delivered the second, fatal wound.

Redman and Hennebry then fled the scene and boarded the bus on which the CCTV footage was filmed.

The court heard that Mr Whiston, from Clacton, Essex, collapsed onto the street outside the party and was rushed to hospital but was later declared dead.

The court heard Mr Whiston had tried to defend a friend after Redman gatecrashed a party he was at in 2012

Redman, of Colchester, received a life sentence for the murder and was given a minimum sentence of 17 years in jail.

Hennebry, also of Colchester, admitted affray and was sent to a young offenders institute for three years this week for the attack on Jay and another incident the night before.

At the end of Redman's trial, Mr Whiston's mother Caroline Shearer paid tribute to her son in a highly emotional victim impact statement.

She said: 'All I know is when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out. Grieving the loss of your child is the hardest work I will ever have to do.

'It is a war I will never be able to finish fighting - a peak I will never be able to climb. Jay’s heart was so big they stabbed him in it - they couldn’t miss it.'
