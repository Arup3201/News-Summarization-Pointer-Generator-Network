For Dennis, 20, from the port of Kolding in southern Denmark, balloons are more than just a party favour - they're a way of life.

One of a growing number of 'looners' worldwide, Dennis and girlfriend Lila, 21, are sexually attracted to the rubber inflatables and say that the toys play a key role in their private life.

Strange though it might sound, the couple insist that not only is their penchant for balloons harmless, it's completely normal as well.

That, however, is not what Dennis thought when he first realised he had an unusual interest in balloons as a teenager.

'I was just continually inflating this balloon and feeling it against my body and then suddenly, it was just the most fantastic and extraordinary thing I have ever tried,' he says of his eureka moment.

But his euphoria soon gave way to fear. 'The way I felt after I found out that I had this special interest in balloons was that I was a freak,' he admits.

'I felt that I was standing out. And I felt most of all that I was alone.'

But, as he soon discovered following a foray onto the internet, he wasn't. Indeed, as Denis soon found out, he wasn't even unusual.

The 'looner' community worldwide is thought to be approximately 250,000 strong, with men outnumbering women by 30 to one.

Passion: According to Dennis, different colour balloons have different meanings for him

Despite sounding like an internet-fuelled phenomenon, looners have also been around for more than three decades, with the first looner club, Buster Bill's Balloon Buddies, launched in 1976.

'A looner has a special interest for balloons,' he explains. 'We use balloons as a sexual aid and we see balloons differently than most other people do.'

For her part, girlfriend Lila had long harboured a fetish for latex outfits and voluptuous gentlemen but all that changed when she met Dennis.

Now a committed looner herself, she says she enjoys being able to combine her penchant for chunky chaps with balloons.

'I love that my man is big,' she smiles. 'It's just who I am and I love big things. I see the balloons a little bit like a man, a big man who I am trying to make a little love with.'

So what exactly does being a looner involve? According to Dennis, much of it revolves around blowing up balloons and cuddling them, although colours do, apparently, make a difference.

Not so good: Dennis prefers balloons made from natural latex as the party variety are too easily popped

'What turns me on about a balloon is mainly the expansion part of it,' he confesses. 'I am very fascinated that such a small thing can grow into being huge  without having to explode, although they do, of course, explode occasionally.

'Every colour wakes up a feeling inside of me,' he adds. 'The yellow colour makes me happy. And then there is these red and black colours as well which are like: "I'm naughty. Do whatever you'd like to do with me".'

'Balloons are brought out during special times, which is one thing that would make it more likely to be a fetish object than something you would see every single day,' comments sexologist and sociologist, Dr Carol Queen.

'Part of the thing that makes a balloon fetish too is that many look as though they're a sexual shape. Many balloons are very breast like. Others are buttock-like.'

Regardless of what shape they are, Dennis, who prefers special balloons made from natural latex, says he won't be giving up his penchant for inflatables any time soon.

'If I had to choose between Lila and my balloons, then I would of course choose her first,' he muses. 'But if there wasn't any other way of doing it, I would probably just hide it and do it by myself.'
