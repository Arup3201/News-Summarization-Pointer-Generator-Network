Absent: Reverend Sara Cliff, pictured, has been labelled the 'invisible woman' after claiming £23,000 for attending just 19 council meetings in three years

A Tory councillor has been labelled the 'invisible woman' after claiming £23,000 for attending just 19 council meetings in three years.

Reverend Sara Cliff, who represents Lincoln East, is estimated to have pocketed just under £500 an hour, despite living 119 miles away in the Cambridgeshire market town of Soham.

Now furious residents are calling for the Lincolnshire County Councillor - whose ward is one of the most deprived areas in the country - to quit.

Between June 2009 and the start of this year, Ms Cliff, 46, attended just 19 from a possible 52 meetings of the county council.

Council colleagues say that each of the meetings she has attended would have lasted around two and a half hours.

This means she attended less than 50 hours of meetings in three years being paid around £484 an hour for her council duties.

Fellow politicians say her attendance is unacceptable. Even her own party leader admitted it was 'not good at all'.

Lincolnshire County Council Labour leader Cllr Rob Parker said 'She should do the decent thing and stand down now.

'The people of Lincoln East are not getting the service they should expect from an elected member.

'She is letting the people down. She lives over 100 miles away and makes little attempt to represent them. 

'She’s the invisible woman. She was missing at this year’s budget meeting when huge cuts were brought in which will affect the people she represents.

'Her ward is one of the most deprived in the country but she wasn’t there to speak up for her constituents.'

Community activist Eve Wind, who chairs the Tower Action Group which represents people living on a local council estate within Cllr Cliff’s ward, said the Conservative had failed to distribute her £2,000 community budget in either 2011 or the current year.

'We have invited her to a number of meetings. She hasn’t even replied. We’re paying her to do a job, so where is she? She should quit and do it now.

'This part of Lincoln is one of the most deprived areas of the country. We are all struggling to survive and keep morale high with activities for the local community, and there she is sitting on £2,000. It is disgraceful. 

'We’re screaming out for a bit of money. I am so annoyed by it all. I feel like she has slapped every volunteer in the face thanks to her lack of action.'

Local resident Sarah Whitworth added 'Nobody I know has seen her in this area. It’s an absolute joke. It’s scandalous to be honest.'

Cllr Marianne Overton, leader of the council’s Independent group, also criticised the Tory. She said 'She is ruining the reputation of county councillors and should step down immediately. I believe it is this kind of example that undermines democracy.

'Perhaps Sara Cliff should donate the substantial sum of allowances she has claimed in the last three years to the community of Lincoln East. It certainly needs the money.'

After being elected in May 2009, Ms Cliff moved to Soham - 119 miles from County Hall where meetings are held - to become a Methodist minister.

Since then, her attendance has plummeted year on year.

Council records show Ms Cliff sat in on six from a possible eight committee meetings in 2009. She went on to attend four from a possible 17 in 2010, and sat in on just one meeting in 2011. This year she has relinquished any committee responsibilities.

In addition to her committee meetings Ms Cliff attended eight from a possible 13 full county council meetings.

Local government rules state councillors must attend at least one meeting every six months.

Ms Cliff attended full council on December 9, 2011. Records show the next meeting she attended was full council on May 18, 2012.

A Lincolnshire County Council spokesman confirmed her poor attendance had been flagged up to the Conservative party by authority clerks. She is the only county councillor to have this happen in the three years of this council.

Martin Hill, the Conservative leader of Lincolnshire County Council, admitted he had spoken to Ms Cliff about her attendance levels six months ago.

'There is no doubt her attendance of late has not been good at all,' he said.

Each year county councillors are allocated £2,000 to spend on small schemes in their patch. Ms Cliff did not spend a penny of her community budget in 2011.

In a statement Ms Cliff said: 'I thoroughly enjoy representing the residents of the Lincoln East ward and make myself available as much as possible to local people who come to me for support.

'My role outside of the council as a reverend has seen me appointed to a parish outside of the county in Soham which means it is more difficult to attend council meetings during the day but I try to attend as many as I can.'

Ms Cliff added that she attends fortnightly meetings of an adoption panel but council attendance records do not include these.
