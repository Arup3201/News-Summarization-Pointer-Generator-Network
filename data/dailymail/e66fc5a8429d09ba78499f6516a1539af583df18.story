 Bitcoin's value has fallen 22 per cent after its most important business Mt. Gox went offline after rumours that $375 million-worth has been stolen.

The rumoured theft and subsequent shutdown has caused problems for the online currency's public and financial image, as it still struggles for legitimacy.

Visitors to the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox site now see only a blank page, and the shutdown of the page follows the resignation of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.

Bitcoin has been majorly set back by the most recent theft and disappearance of Mt. Gox, known as the most important business in the Bitcoin economy

Bitcoin trader Kolin Burgess said he had 
picketed the Tokyo headquarters of Mt. Gox since Feb. 14 after flying in from London, having lost $320,000 that he has tied up with the company.

Burgess said: 'I may have lost all of my 
money...it hasn't shaken my trust in Bitcoin, but it has shaken my trust in Bitcoin exchanges.'

A 'crisis strategy' report shared widely online that claims to be an 
internal Mt. Gox document says more than 740,000 bitcoins are missing 
from the exchange, around 6 per cent of all Bitcoins currently in existence.

The Mt. Gox exchange froze withdrawals this month after reports from traders of increased delays trying to withdraw funds, with some waiting three months before being told they couldn't withdraw anything.

It says 
the theft went unnoticed for several years and turned on disguised 
withdrawals.

The theft is equal to losses of $350 million at current bitcoin 
prices, but in reality, such a figure is highly uncertain because of 
Bitcoin's extreme fluctuations in value and its lack of acceptance
 as a currency.

 Bitcoin is a piece of data confined to an internet network by an algorithm.

Once
 released it can be traded and used like money online and can be 
purchased with real cash.

Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a 
form of currency.

As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins.

It
 has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as 
the future of money.

It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and 
complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according 
to the developers.

There
 are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite 
nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold.

The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009.

Users
 choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables
 them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.

Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces

Financial speculators are saying the problems with Mt. Gox are hindering Bitcoin, which was 
started in 2009 as a currency free from government controls.

Meanwhile, supporters of the virtual currency have said its cryptography makes it 
immune to theft or counterfeiting.

Because of Mt. Gox's recent disappearance, Bitcoin currency's value has fallen from $550 to $418 in the past few hours.

The six major Bitcoin exchanges and related organizations have released a joint statement that said they are working to 're-establish the trust squandered' by the failings of Mt. Gox.

They said funds under their control are held securely, and Mt. Gox should not be considered a reflection of the value of Bitcoin or the digital currency industry.

The joint statement insisted that Mt. Gox doesn't reflect the practices of the digital currency industry or the denigrate the value of Bitcoin itself.

The statement said: 'This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company's actions.

'As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing.

'Mt. Gox has confirmed its issues in private discussions with other members of the Bitcoin community.

'There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in Bitcoin.

'These
 companies will continue to build the future of money by making Bitcoin 
more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants.'

Crash: The value of the online currency has fallen fast in the time since Mt. Gox disappeared from the internet, sparking fears among Bitcoin investors and enthusiasts.

Bitcoin is an attempt to create a currency that is free of government influence, and it is one the public have been slow to accept

Mt. Gox was founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange website by Jed McCaleb, specifically for the use of buying and selling Magic: The Gathering trading cards.

In 2010 it changed to a Bitcoin exchange, and when Bitcoin started to dramatically rise in value in 2011, McCaleb sold the business to the now former Bitcoin Foundation board member Mark Karpeles, who became the CEO.

Following Karpeles takeover, the company became one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges in the world, managing over 70 per cent of Bitcoin exchanges by April 2013.

Mt. Gox proceeded to have several troubles over the years, with examples including:

Despite there being no trace of Mt. Gox at their Tokyo offices, their name is still listed in the building directory, and people continue to picket outside.

Burgess said: 'I have no idea where they are.

'I'm both annoyed and worried.'

Before Mt. Gox's disappearance, Bitcoin
 had been heading toward broader acceptance in spite of wild swings in value
 in the past year.

For most of the currency's history, each digital coin
 had been worth less than $10.

New Bitcoins are 'mined' or generated by computers, and they get harder to 
generate all the time, which means the inflow of fresh Bitcoins keeps 
falling.

Today, there are about 
12.4 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Blockchain, a 
public registry of Bitcoin transactions.

The maximum number of Bitcoins 
that can be generated is 21 million, and it is estimated that by 2032, 99 per cent of those 
will have been created.

Silk Road 2.0, the successor to the dark web and a major Bitcoin marketplace, was hacked on Feburary 14 by attackers who made off with nearly $2.7million in bitcoin - 
the online marketplace's entire holdings.

The
 trading site is a reincarnation of Silk Road, the online black market 
that was shut down last year following an FBI 
sting.

The site's
 administrator, Defcon, said it had been infiltrated by the same hackers who 
exploited the 'transaction malleability' that caused temporary 
transfer shutdowns at bitcoin exchanges BitStamp and Mt Gox earlier this month.

Defcon is now calling on the hackers to return the bitcoin.

The
 site’s users attempted to track down one theif, who was responsible for around 95 per cent of the theft.

News of the theft has driven the price of BTC down by about 50 points at the time, with hackers making off with over 4474 bitcoins, worth $2,747,000.

Defcon said that a claims a vendor exploited the bug 
during a vulnerable moment in the site's relaunch process, initiating 
and hiding a flood of transactions until the accounts were emptied.
