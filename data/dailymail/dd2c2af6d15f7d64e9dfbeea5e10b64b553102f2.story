A devastated mother has told how her son died aged 12 days old after doctors cancelled a life-saving heart operation five times in a week.

Danielle Gatehouse, 23, said staff at the scandal-hit Bristol Children's Hospital deemed her son Harley Pascoe 'too healthy' for an immediate operation.

Miss Gatehouse and partner Lee Pascoe, from Fraddon in Cornwall, are now considering legal action over the treatment Harley, who was born with half a heart, received on ward 32 of the hospital.

Harley died on October 1 last year after being denied a potentially life-saving operation for a week, his parents claim

Miss Gatehouse was induced at 38 weeks after Harley's heart condition was picked up by scans. The child was born at Bristol’s St Michael’s Hospital in September weighing 7lb 7oz.

The baby was then transferred to Bristol Children's Hospital and Miss Gatehouse said she was told Harley would need three operations wuith the aim of inserting a shunt into his heart to improve blood flow.

She was told if the operations were successful, he would have an 80 per cent chance of living a normal life, The Sunday People reported.

On the Monday they arrived at ward 32, the couple were told the proceedure had been postponed for three days. Miss Gatehouse said the operation was postponed again on the Wednesday until Friday, and on the Thursday she was told it was nothing to worry about.

When Friday came, the operation was put back for a third time. Then on Sunday, September 29, the procedure was postponed for a fourth time.

All the time, Miss Gatehouse said her baby was deteriorating in front of her.

It
 was reported that the reasons for the postponements given to the parents included that he was 'too healthy 
and not an emergency' and there was a bed shortage.

It was only after he became an emergency case on the Monday that Harley was rushed into the operating theatre.

But six hours after he was finally operated on, his blood pressure dropped and he could not be revived. Harley died on October 1 last year.

The
 couple say they still have no explanation for the tragedy, but they 
believe the wait for an operation severely limited his chances of 
survival.

They say they are still waiting for official confirmation of the cause of Harley’s death, after an inconclusive post mortem.

Miss Gatehouse told The Sunday People:
 'We were at his bedside day in, day out, seeing him getting weaker. Yet
 doctors were repeatedly telling us Harley was not ill enough.

'How
 sick did our baby have to be? He had half a heart – it doesn’t get much
 worse than that. I can’t forgive the hospital for how it treated my 
baby.

'Five times in a week 
his operation was cancelled. After they eventually operated, we stroked 
his tiny hand, whispered to him that we were so proud of how brave he’d 
been and loved him so much.'

Harley was buried on October 18.

A spokesperson for the hospital trust told the People that Harley’s operation was postponed because he was 'stable' and there were more urgent cases.

The trust added that its mortality rates of 2.5 per cent ranked well nationally.
