James Purnell, who served as both Culture and Work and Pensions Secretary in Gordon Brown's Cabinet, has been appointed as the BBC's strategy chief

The appointment of a former Labour cabinet minister to a senior BBC job on a salary of almost £300,000 a year last night re-ignited concerns over the corporation’s links with the Left.

James Purnell, who served as both Culture and Work and Pensions Secretary under Gordon Brown, has been handed the job as the corporation’s strategy chief.

MPs claimed it was ‘unprecedented’ to have someone with such a politically active past become a senior BBC executive, while others said having a ‘partisan political figure’ would do little to reassure people that the corporation is impartial.

Even insiders admitted it did little to dispel the impression there was ‘a revolving door between the Left and the BBC’.

Eyebrows were also raised over the fact that there was no open recruitment process for Mr Purnell’s job. Sources at the BBC claimed there was no point in such a costly exercise because he was viewed as the ideal candidate for the newly-created job.

It is understood no fees were paid for recruitment consultants. Mr Purnell will receive £295,000 to be the corporation’s director of strategy and digital when he joins next month.

He will be a key figure in the BBC’s charter renewal negotiations over the next few years, but has also been given a role which puts him in charge of communications, policy, public affairs, marketing and audiences.

It will make him one of the corporation’s best paid and most powerful executives.

Mr Purnell quit Parliament in 2010 and is currently a senior producer at production company Rare Day as well as an adviser to the Boston Consulting Group.

MPs warned he would have to make it clear he had put his ‘Labour affiliations’ well behind him.

Conor Burns, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, who sits on the culture, media and sport select committee, said he had an ‘intrinsic nervousness’ about the appointment.

He said: ‘There is sometimes an agenda within the BBC that is Left-leaning.

'The BBC does not just need to be impartial, it needs to be seen to be impartial, and it is hard to see how it is impartial when it has just appointed a former Labour cabinet minister to head up its public affairs programme.’

John Whittingdale, chairman of the committee, added: ‘I recognise that James Purnell is a bright guy with a lot of experience.

‘But it is unprecedented to have someone in a management role that has been quite as politically active and he will have to make it clear he has left his Labour affiliations behind him.’

Another member of the committee, Tory Philip Davies, described the move as ‘provocative’ and ‘totally unacceptable’ in the light of previous accusations of Left-wing bias against the BBC.

One senior BBC boss said: ‘He is probably very capable. But having a former secretary of state working on charter renewal is a bit weird.’

They added that his appointment would add to the impression that there was a ‘revolving door between the Left and the BBC’.

Yesterday the corporation said that Mr Purnell had stepped down from his membership of the Labour Party. He has resigned as chairman of a left-of-centre think tank.

Others pointed out that the BBC Trust’s chairman, Lord Patten, is a former Tory Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party chairman.

Mr Purnell previously worked at the BBC as head of corporate planning from 1995 to 1997 under former director general Lord Birt.

He said: ‘I’m really excited to be coming back to the BBC. Over the last couple of years, producing and developing programmes has rekindled my passion for the career I had before politics.’

A member of the board of the British Film Institute and the Royal National Theatre, he also wrote on Twitter: ‘I feel very lucky to be going back. It’s a special and important place.’

The BBC said that his deal would not represent an increase to the senior management pay bill.

Savings are likely to be made as other executives lose their jobs in the restructure which accompanies Mr Purnell’s appointment.

A spokesman said: ‘It is perfectly possible for an individual to work at the BBC without allowing their personal views to impact on their job and the BBC has strong guidelines on potential conflicts of interest that may be caused by political activity.’
