Michael Hayes, 20, pictured, grabbed a woman police officer's bottom 'as a joke' as he walked through central London

A drunken man who grabbed a woman police officer's bottom in the street 'as a joke' was convicted of sexual assault today.

Michael Hayes, 20, of Wallington, Surrey, molested the woman as she was walking along Bridge Street in Westminster, central London.

The Met officer then turned around and confronted him, asking: 'What the hell do you think you're doing?'

She told him she was an off-duty policewoman and Hayes then said: 'I’m sorry, I’m drunk,' Westminster Magistrates Court heard.

The man tried to escape - but the officer chased him down the road and he was arrested by a uniformed officer.

After he was arrested, Hayes claimed he grabbed the officer’s bottom 'as a joke' because one of his friends had dared him to.

He pleaded guilty to sexual assault in court today following the incident on July 21.

He was released on bail and will be sentenced on 12 August.

Prosecutor Nicholas Earl told the court today: ‘The complainant in this case was an off-duty police officer.

‘She was walking along Bridge Street and felt her bottom being grabbed.

‘She turned around and confronted Hayes, asking him "what the hell do you think you’re doing?"

‘She explained she was an off-duty officer, produced a warrant card, showed it to him and told him to remain there.

‘He replied "I’m sorry, I’m drunk".  She tried to stop him getting away by grabbing his arm but he managed to wriggle out and run away.

‘She chased after him and saw a uniformed officer and alerted him to Hayes.

‘He was detained a short while later and when cautioned said "I want to apologise, it’s only because I’m drunk."

‘In interview he fully admitted assaulting the officer.

‘Hayes claimed he was with his friend, they had been drinking alcohol and his friend dared him to grab someone’s bottom and with that in mind he went up to the off-duty officer 'for a joke'.

‘He knew that was wrong and improper but did it anyway.’

Euan Macmillan, defending, said Hayes is remorseful.

He said: ‘He clearly picked on the wrong person for all sorts of obvious reasons and his behaviour was poor and he knows that.’

Magistrate Gay Cheyne warned Hayes that he could be sent to prison.

‘We are going to adjourn this matter for a pre-sentence report,’ she said.

‘We are leaving all options open so the sentence could be anything up to custody.’

Hayes grabbed the off-duty officer's bottom while the two were walking down Bridge Street in Westminster, London. A court heard how the woman confronted him, asking: 'What the hell do you think you are doing?'

The man pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was released on bail. He will be sentenced next month
