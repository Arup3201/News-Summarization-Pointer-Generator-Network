A man has told how he was taken on a 'death roll' by a crocodile as he hunted near a creek but managed to escape when he poked the beast in the eye.

Stephen Moreen, 20, was hunting pigs, geese and emu in Peppimenarti, 320 kilometres south-west of Darwin, in the Northern Territory, about 7.20pm on Friday when he waded into the water to collect a water fowl that a member of the group he was with had shot.

He was in a two metres of water when the crocodile struck, latching its giant jaws on to his arm.

Mr Moreen said he drunk beer after the attack to numb the pain

Mr Moreen was transported by Care Flight to Darwin Royal Hospital for further attention to his numerous wounds

The animal, thought to be 2m long, dragged Mr Moreen underwater. 

'We were shooting geese, my cousin-brother told me go and get the duck there,' Mr Moreen told the ABC from the Peppimenarti Community Health Clinic.

'I just walked. I got the first goose, the second one, then the number three one, he grabbed my on my arm.

 'The croc did the death-roll. Lucky for me when we went underwater I saw him and poked his eye. He let go. Once he let go he ran for the bank. Then my cousin-brother shot him.' 

Mr Moreen's sister-in-law, who was in the hunting party, was able to give him first aid before they took him on a quad bike to the nearby Wudaduk Outstation, where he waited for an ambulance.

Mr Moreen told the ABC that at he drank some beer to numb the pain as he waited to be airlifted to the Royal Darwin Hospital. 

'I wasn't too worried until I saw the scars,' he said.

'It made me cry. I'm fine, I'm alive. It could have been bad. It could have got my leg. I was about waist deep.

'I have a scratch on my back, the rest on my arm. He ripped out a bit of skin and left me with two to three holes.'  

The 20-year-old was hunting for geese in wetlands near Wudaduk Outstation, about 20 kilometres from the remote community of Peppimenarti in the Top End

The man was attacked by a crocodile, estimated to be about two metres in length when he waded into the water to recover a goose he had shot 

Bart Irwin, the head of the Northern Territory branch of Field and Game Australia, advises against hunting in dark conditions

Superintendent Louise Jorgensen told Daily Mail Australia: 'Like a true Territorian, he wrestled the crocodile and was able to shake it off finally by poking its eyes.

'He was conveyed to Darwin via Care Flight for further attention to the numerous puncture wounds, tears and claw marks to his arm and back. He is one lucky man.' 

The hunting of waterfowls is an ancient tradition in the Northern Territory. This year's hunting season started on September 12.

Bart Irwin, the head of the Northern Territory branch of Field and Game Australia said retrieving birds from marshlands is too dangerous, and that hunters should be using dogs. 

He told the ABC: 'I'd hate to lose one of my dogs. I try and hunt in areas where I don't put them in danger – but better them than me. I love my dogs but I love my legs.'

Mr Irwin said Mr Moreen was probably also hunting too late in the day. 

'That sort of darkness gives the crocs the upper hand,' he said.
