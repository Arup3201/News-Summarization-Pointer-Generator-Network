Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

Barcelona will turn their attentions to Gonzalo Higuain if they fail to land Sergio Aguero this summer, according to Mundo Deportivo.

The Catalans are looking to add new faces to their side after a dismal campaign under Gerardo Martino which ended trophyless.

Claim: Marca say Real Madrid are lining up a move for Luis Suarez while L'Equipe back Michel Platini to the hilt

Higuain's spell at bitter rivals Real Madrid isn't said to have any bearing on Barca's interest, but they remain keener on his Argentina team-mate Aguero.

The same paper also links Luis Enrique with a move for Polish defender Lukasz Piszczek, currently at Borussia Dortmund.

Marca claim that Real Madrid are in the process of prepping a bid for Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, while Carlo Ancelotti is bullish on the front of AS by stating that the club is now a 'world religion'.

The Spanish tax office have found another problem with the Neymar deal from Santos and have called president Sandro Rosell to appear in court on June 13.

Vicente Del Bosque has a selection headache on the eve of the World Cup, with the same paper saying Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas will go head-to-head for the No 9 spot.

Meanwhile over in Italy, Juventus want to inflict more pain on Serie A next season by signing a glut of star names.

Tuttosport report that Antonio Conte wants to strengthen in the wide areas with Real Madrid's Marcelo, Barcelona's Adriano and Daryl Janmaat of Feyenoord on the manager's radar.

National coach Cesare Prandelli has gone on the offensive in Corriere dello Sport by attacking Giuseppe Rossi for lashing out after he wasn't called up to the Italy World Cup squad.

Prandelli made it abundantly clear that he had been straight with the Fiorentina striker throughout, even if Rossi claimed otherwise.

Interestingly, French national L'Equipe has waded into the ongoing debate surrounding Qatar, asking 'Who is out to get Michel Platini?' in a bold front page backing the UEFA president and national treasure.Â
