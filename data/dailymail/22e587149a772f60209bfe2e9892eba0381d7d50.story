When reporter Lauren Vargas was sent to cover a bee swarm, she knew there was going to be a buzz about it.

However when the ABC 15 correspondent arrived at the scene in Phoenix, she didn't realize she would be the one to get stung.

The journalist was filming a segment for the Arizona station about a swarm of the insects which had caused a neighborhood to virtually lock down on Saturday when the pest got into her hair.

She freaked out, so a fire captain came to help her out.

But, however hard she tried to get rid of the bee, it stung her scalp.

Vargas starts screaming: 'It stung me'

She said her initial reaction was pain, but when she started to edit the footage in her news van, she could only see the funny side of it.

The story concerned a hive that had developed on the roof of a women's house while she and the other occupants were away.

A neighbor called 911, prompting the emergency services to tell residents to stay inside.

One person who was caught up in the swarm was reportedly stung eight times. 

In Utah, 1,000 bees terrorized baseball fans on Saturday. One man was said to have been stung between 200 and 300 times and is now recovering in hospital. 

Several other people were treated for stings at the scene.

Lone Peak High School baseball coach Matt Bezzant told The Spectrum newspaper of St. George that the bees came from a dugout and players were chased by as many as 70 bees at one point.

Fire crews doused the dugout area with a chemical foam to combat the bees. 

Reaction: Vargas said it was initially painful, but now sees the funny side of it
