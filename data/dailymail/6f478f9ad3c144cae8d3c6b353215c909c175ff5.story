An English language teacher has been arrested in Washington D.C. after he allegedly murdered four members of his family in the Czech Republic.

The man, identified as 20-year-old American citizen Kevin Dahlgren, fled the Czech Republic for the U.S. after four bodies were found in the family house in the city of Brno, 200km southeast of Prague, on Wednesday.

'Kevin Dahlgren, charged with quadruple homicide, was detained on 
Thursday,' Czech regional police chief Leos Trzil told reporters
on Friday.

He arrived at the court shackled in a green jail jumpsuit and guarded by two U.S. marshals.

Neighbors said Dahlgren had been visiting his aunt and uncle, Veronika and Martin Harok, and their two sons, 22-year-old Filip and 18-year-old David, in Brno. He arrived just a few weeks ago.

They have been named by local TV reports as the victims of the brutal attack. They were all found dead by firefighters who responded to calls of a fire.

It is believed this was an attempt by the killer to cover up the murders. They were all stabbed in the head and neck several times.

'We were originally called to intervene against a fire. On the spot the suspicions arose that a violent crime had been committed. We immediately called the police,' firefighters' spokesman Jaroslav Mikoska told ABC News.

Veronika Harok was a Czech language 
teacher at the local elementary school.

Martin Harok and his son Filip 
were musicians who played several nights a week with a local ukulele 
orchestra, while the youngest victim, David Harok, was described as very
involved in sports and also loved to play the guitar.

The Facebook page in his name, set up
only earlier this month, says Dahlgren was from Palo Alto, California, 
and was offering English lessons in Brno.

However, spokespersons for the Palo Alto Unified School District, Palo Alto police department and Stanford University said there was no record of Dahlgren in their files.

The Czech Justice Ministry said it now had two months to ask for his extradition.

Their dead bodies were discovered late on Wednesday in the family's home.

Czech TV station tn.cz. reported that Dahlgren's parents sent him overseas to live a quiet, simpler life because of psychological issues. He was said to be having an identity crisis of some kind.Â
