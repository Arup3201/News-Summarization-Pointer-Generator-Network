Beneath the Regency splendour of Sussex Square in Brighton is a little-known tunnel that connects the square’s private gardens to the seafront. 

When writer Lewis Carroll used to visit Brighton, the ivy-strewn tunnel fascinated him and, according to some, was the inspiration for the hole through which Alice fell in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland, so starting her escapades with the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts and the Cheshire Cat.

Now, 150 years since the publication of the children’s classic, which will be marked with a number of special events, literary fans have the rare chance to buy a complete Regency townhouse just above the tunnel. 

Regency splendour: The Alice in Wonderland townhouse in the exclusive Lewes Crescent in Brighton

The house, which inspired author Lewis Carroll, comes with a west-facing balcony and a 65ft Italianate rear garden

The Grade I listed five-storey property in exclusive Lewes Crescent carries a £4.25million price tag, making it one of the most expensive homes ever to have come to market in the seaside city.

Lewes Crescent sits at the bottom of Sussex Square on the seafront in the Kemp Town area. The house itself was designed by Charles Busby and Amon Henry Wilds in the 1820s and built by Thomas Cubitt. According to Brighton Heritage Department, it is one of only a few Regency properties that has not been converted into flats, and it comes with access to the private gardens and incredible unobstructed sea views. 

Musician Nick Cave and his model wife Susie Bick live nearby in Sussex Square, and when fellow Australian Cate Blanchett bought a house there in the Noughties, the road had to be closed while an enormous new bath was winched into her home.

Price: £4.25million

Location: Kemp Town, Brighton

Bedrooms: Six

Unique features: One of the city's few Regency houses, cinema room, iPad-operated lighting

Barry Grogan, 59, who owns the Lewes Crescent property, says it was in a dilapidated state when he bought it with two business partners last January.

The property developer adds: ‘We befriended the former owner when we worked on a nearby property in 2010. He was an art dealer who had lived here for about 40 years. A large, vaulted room with roof lights at the top of the building was probably a former studio, but latterly he just lived on the lower ground floor. He loved the place and had no intention of moving, but he sadly passed away in January 2013.’

Barry has since brought the 4,600ft six-bedroom house up to date, adding a cinema room, steam room and state-of-the-art Helvar lighting system that is operated via an iPad. He even managed to gain permission to add a double-height glass conservatory.

Revamp: The Grade I listed home's modern kitchen maintains its intricate coving

The ivy-strewn tunnel outside the home is said to have provided Carroll with the inspiration for the hole Alice falls through at the start of the book

There are grand Doric pillars at the entrance, four reception rooms, three bathrooms, a fantastic sweeping staircase, a west-facing balcony and a 65ft Italianate rear garden. There are parquet floors throughout the ground floor, high ceilings, intricate coving and original fireplaces.

The lower ground floor has underfloor heating and a huge family room, while the highlight of the first floor is the ‘grand lounge and library’, which has three floor-to-ceiling French windows opening on to the large balcony.

New skylights on the top floor flood the bedrooms with light and there are views from the back to the Sussex Downs. Explaining the high asking price, Barry says: ‘It is like a new build dressed up in Regency clothing. None of the other complete Regency properties has had such a thorough redevelopment.’

Apart from the Alice connection, the property is rich in history, having been the original home of Roedean girls’ school.

So who does Barry think the house will suit in the future?

‘We’d love it to be a family house so that all of its many delights are fully used. However, it would just as easily suit being a weekend or holiday home.

‘It would be good if the buyer was from Brighton, but they will more likely come from London or overseas.’

Or maybe the new owner will be a big fan of Alice who fancies a new adventure down by the sea…
