A 'heartbroken' polar bear in South Africa has died in a zoo after months of pining over the death of his partner earlier this year.

Officials at Johannesburg Zoo said Wang, 28, believed to be the last polar bear in Africa, was put down because it was suffering from heart and liver failure.

The zoo said Wang had been pining over the death in January of polar bear GeeBee, his partner of 27 years at the zoo.

He was the last remaining polar bear at the zoo, which has said it does not plan to replace the animals.

Keepers had given Wang special treats following the death of GeeBee and even a Valentine's Day celebration to try to cheer him up.

Born in 1985, Wang arrived at the Johannesburg zoo one year later as part of a conservation exchange program with a zoo in Japan.

Zoo spokesman Jenny Moodley told The Telegraph that for a day after the death of GeeBee, Wang would not let zookeepers take her body.

Ms Moodley said the bear also became 'quite aggressive' following the loss of his partner.

Last month MailOnline reported how Argentina had refused to relocate its lonely polar bear to a wildlife park that specializes in the species, despite a petition by more than half a million people.

Animal rights activists had been calling on the 28-year-old animal to be moved to a zoo in Winnipeg, Canada, over claims that it was showing signs of stress.

But Gustavo Pronotto, director of Mendoza Zoo, said that the bear, named Arturo, was too elderly to make the nearly 6,000-mile journey.

Pronotto said that to make the two-day journey, Arturo would have to be sedated which carries risk for an animal his age.

'Arturo is close to his caretakers. We just want everyone to stop bothering the bear,' he said.

He added that the behaviors which others had highlighted as signs that the animal was in distress were merely down to his age.

A team of vets in Argentina ruled in February that the polar bear should remain in the zoo.

Arturo's plight came to the attention of animal rights advocates, who dubbed him 'the world's saddest animal' when they launched a petition to call for him to be moved.

The polar bear has been alone in his enclosure since his partner, Pelusa, died of cancer in 2012.
