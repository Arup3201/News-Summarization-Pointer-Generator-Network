Borrusia Monchengladbach have offered £6.8million for Chelsea starlet Thorgan Hazard.

The 21-year-old brother of Eden has impressed during his loan spell and the German side want to make his move permanent.

Sportsmail reported that talks were ongoing last week and the fourth-placed Bundesliga side have followed that up with a firm offer as they press for a Champions League place.

Hazard has also been on loan at Belgian side Zulte Waregem and is considering whether his prospects of breaking through at Stamford Bridge are too limited.

The former Lens youngster has made 15 Bundesliga appearances this season, scoring once and providing four assists.

Hazard joined Chelsea for an undisclosed fee from the French club in July 2012, a month after his brother Eden had signed from Lille for £32m. 

The younger Hazard has played once for Belgium, in 2013, and was on the stand-by list for the World Cup.
