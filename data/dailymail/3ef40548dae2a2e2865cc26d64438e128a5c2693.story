From a shady villain lurking in the background, to scantily clad women and the suave superspy himself, it is the very essence of a classic Bond movie.

And anyone who takes a shine to this original cinema poster for 1962 blockbuster Dr No will this week get a chance to buy it – providing they have rather deep pockets.

Experts at Bonhams expect the poster for the first Bond movie, starring Sir Sean Connery, will fetch around £5,000 at the firm’s London auction rooms tomorrow.

Iconic: The rare UK poster for the first ever James Bond film, 1962's Dr No,  is expected to fetch £5,000

Bonhams’ head of entertainments memorabilia, Stephanie Connell, said she expected fierce bidding when the 30in x 40in poster goes under the hammer.

She added: ‘Dr No was the movie that launched the whole Bond franchise and this rare original poster would have been used in a UK cinema to advertise it.

‘It is one of the rarest and most sought-after you can find.

Stylish: The American poster has been valued at between £300 and £500

‘The artists have really captured the
 film but it has everything. It features all of the things that  people 
associate with Bond –  Connery in his tuxedo, holding his gun and, 
obviously, the girls and the villain.

Classic: Sean Connery and his Dr No co-star Ursula Andress

‘Dr
 No was the first Bond movie. While there would have been some hype, it 
wasn’t yet a guarantee of success, so it’s all the more remarkable that 
this poster survived, particularly in such good condition.’

She added: ‘Sean Connery is the original Bond and, in many people’s minds, still the best. When collectors think of Bond, they think of Sean Connery.

'There is a growing market for Daniel Craig but it’s always Connery and his posters which command the best prices.

‘This poster will appeal to movie fanatics, Bond fanatics and anybody who wants an iconic film poster for their wall or office. It’s almost timeless.’

The movie is best remembered for the stunning scene when original Bond girl Ursula Andress, playing Honey Ryder, emerges from the sea in a bikini – a sequence dubbed one of the sexiest in film history.

The poster, which is in perfect condition, comes from a private UK collection.

Other items in the sale include a US version of the Dr No poster,  valued at £300-£500, while one  for the 1963 Bond film From Russia With Love is expected to fetch £500-£800.

Others advertising the 1967 film You Only Live Twice and 1971 movie Diamonds Are Forever, also starring Connery as 007, are expected to make £500-£700.

Meanwhile, a poster for James Bond: On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, which starred ‘forgotten’ 007 actor George Lazenby, is expected to make £300-£500 at Bonhams’ sale of Entertainment Memorabilia.
