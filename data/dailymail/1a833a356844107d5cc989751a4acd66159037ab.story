Thomas Hitzlsperger says it would have been almost impossible for him to come out as gay had he still been playing professionally. 

The former Aston Villa midfielder, who retired from football back in January, believes that he couldn't of come out as homosexual during his time as a player because of the media.

He told the Metro in a Q & A: 'I did so many interviews and it took up all of my time so it would have been difficult to go back into training as if nothing had happened. 

Proud: Thomas Hitzlsperger is the only openly gay player to have played in the Premier League

'For me it would have been almost impossible had I still been playing – not because of the fans or the other players, but because of the media.'

The 32-year-old is an ardent supporter of the Stonewall campaign – a lesbian, gay and bisexual rights charity in the UK – which helps tackle homophobia in football.

And the former Germany international says players should show their support to the campaign this weekend by wearing rainbow laces.

Respect: Hitzlsperger spent short spells at Everton and West Ham, as well as four years at Aston Villa 

He added: 'It would show there is no place for prejudice in football. Last year Everton, one of my former clubs, wore the laces which was great.

'Some players may not want to because of their personal beliefs, and we must respect that, but it is great to see so many players and clubs getting involved.'

As well as Hitzlsperger a number of Arsenal players have pledged their support to the rainbow laces campaign, including England duo Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, as well as QPR midfielder Joey Barton.
