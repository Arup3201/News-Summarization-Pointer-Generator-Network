Branded: BBC's Neil Oliver in a Berghaus jacket

The BBC has been accused of allowing its presenters to advertise Berghaus clothing by ‘the back door’ – after negotiating a deal to buy jackets at a 45 per cent discount. 

The Corporation has spent thousands kitting out staff on its most popular programmes in a range of the brand’s latest jackets and fleeces.

Presenters such as BBC news anchor George Alagiah and diplomatic correspondent Peter Hunt have been seen in the jackets bearing the brand’s red and blue logo alongside the name Berghaus.

Regional reporters Jon Kay, Alex Bushill and Fiona Trott, science host Professor Brian Cox and Coast presenter Neil Oliver have also worn them on screen.

BBC editorial guidelines state that staff should adhere to a set of strict rules banning them from the on-screen promotion of products or brands.

The reason for Berghaus’s on-screen popularity is the BBC’s massive discount on the brand.

But MPs accused the Corporation of ‘advertising by the back door’ and many licence fee payers have aired their concerns on internet message boards.

One wrote: ‘The advertising of products or the deliberate, prominent display of commercial brand logos whilst on-screen by BBC personnel is forbidden by the Corporation.’

Another wrote: ‘Why do I keep seeing 
TV presenters wearing Berghaus coats? Just seen one with the Berghaus 
logo on one side and BBC on the other. What’s this shameless advertising
 on the Beeb?’

The Mail on 
Sunday can reveal through the Freedom of Information Act that the BBC 
bought 169 jackets from Berghaus during the last financial year.

When bought in shops, the waterproof jackets cost between £85 and £320.

But the BBC has negotiated a deal to 
purchase the items for a corporate discount worth a minimum of 45 per 
cent, although bigger discounts may apply.

The jackets were given out free of 
charge to staff on location, but the Corporation refused to say how much
 it has spent on them and who received them.

Estimates based on an average-priced 
jacket costing £200 would put the figure at more than £18,500 in the 
past year, including the discount.

The
 special deal has been in existence since 2005 – prompting speculation 
the BBC has actually spent much more on clothing since it came into 
place.

As part of a separate deal, BBC staff are already entitled to purchase Berghaus items personally at a discount of 45 per cent.

'Clearly the licence fee payers don't benefit from this arrangement'

Last night the Corporation insisted it had no arrangement to advertise any brand of clothing via on-screen presenters.

But Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons media select committee, said: ‘It is inappropriate for any relationship to exist between the BBC and any commercial organisation wanting to advertise through the back door, and this appears to be a case of just that.

'Clearly the licence fee payers don’t benefit from this arrangement in any way.’

Liberal Democrat culture spokesman 
Don Foster said: ‘The BBC should be squeaky clean about any commercial 
arrangements it enters into, particularly if the products might be seen 
on screen.’

In March, Berghaus made clear on its website that it has no advertising deal with the BBC.

The brand was founded in 1966 by Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison, two climbers and mountaineers from the North East.

Frustrated by what they saw as a lack of decent outdoor gear, they decided to import and sell their own.

In 1972 they began designing and manufacturing their own products in a shop in Newcastle under the brand name ‘Berghaus’ – meaning ‘mountain house’ in German. The firm still has its headquarters in Sunderland.

Last night the BBC said: ‘Berghaus is one of a number of suppliers of clothing used by the BBC. It would be wrong to suggest the BBC ever agrees to clothing discounts in exchange for on-air promotion.’

The BBC Trust said it had received no complaints on the issue. Berghaus said: ‘No advertising or sponsorship deal exists between the BBC and Berghaus as this would break the BBC’s editorial guidelines.

‘It is common practice for us to agree favourable trade terms for broadcasters such as the BBC, and for individual staff.’

The North Face: BBC newsreader Evan Davis

This is not the first time questions have been asked about the BBC’s use of branded clothing on screen.

There was a similar ‘product 
placement’ controversy in 2008 when several high-profile presenters made
 regular appearances in outdoor clothing showing The North Face’s logo.

Economics editor Evan Davis, business
 presenter Declan Curry, Newsnight’s David Grossman, Paris correspondent
 Clive Myrie and transport correspondent Tom Symonds were all criticised
 for wearing the distinctive American brand on camera.

There was yet another controversy over BBC attire worn by staff at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada.

Presenters including Clare Balding 
were seen by millions wearing jackets bearing the letter K – the logo of
 Kjus, one of the skiing world’s most expensive brands.
