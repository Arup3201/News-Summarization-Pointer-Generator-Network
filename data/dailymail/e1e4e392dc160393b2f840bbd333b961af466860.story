Two New Jersey drug addicts who were arrested last year after the woman's baby nearly died after eating heroin have avoided prison time.  

Mark Tomat, 26, this week admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff on Valentine's Day 2014.

Last month, Bradbury - who comes from an upper-middle class New Jersey community - gave birth to a second child while she was being treated at an intensive program - to ensure she didn't take any more drugs to harm her unborn son.  

Mark Tomat, 26, admitted to a judge that he and his girlfriend Tara Bradbury, 23, took heroin at her home in Wyckoff last February. Bradbury's nine-month-old baby accidentally ingested the drug 

Tomat said he left the narcotic lying around the house and learned Bradbury's baby had ingested the drug about an hour after he left  that night.

Police found text messages between the two in which they talked about a plan to deny that they knew the baby had eaten heroin - so as not to incriminate themselves. 

Paramedics responding to a 911 call found the infant unresponsive and with a bruised forehead. The baby recovered after it was administered Narcan, an antidote for heroin overdose.

Bradbury, who is from the upper-middle-class community Indian Hills, was sentenced to drug court, which means she will be provided with ongoing treatment in an intensely supervised drug treatment program.

On February 27 she delivered the couple's first child together - her second. 

Bradbury voluntarily entered Bergen County Jail earlier that month so that she could receive proper medical attention in the weeks leading up to her due date, according to her attorney Joseph Rem.

Her stay would also protect Bradbury from doing anything that could potentially hurt the fetus, Rem told the Cliffview Pilot. 

Tomat will be sentenced to probation in exchange for his plea. 

His attorney Warren Sutnick said Tomat has made 'enormous strides' since the incident and that he believes his client will be 'very successful'. 

When Wyckoff Police Department officers searched Bradbury's home last year, they discovered Suboxone, which is used to treat narcotic addiction, and other drug paraphernalia, according to prosecutor John L. Molinelli.

Molinelli said investigators also found deleted text messages from Bradbury and Tomat's cell phones in which the couple allegedly planned to deny that they knew the baby had ingested heroin. 

The infant is now in the care of relatives.
