An overweight mum shed seven stones after suffering the embarrassment of being turned away from an Alton Towers ride because she was too fat.

Jackie Hem, 37, had been waiting for her turn on the theme park's popular 'Air' rollercoaster, where revellers are suspended in a harness before being travelling head first around the track.

But as the 20 stone parent prepared to be buckled in, she realised the safety belt would not fasten around her midriff.

Too big: Staff at Alton Towers had to turn Jackie away from the Air ride after she had waited with her children

Overweight: The mum-of-three had queued for the 'Air' ride, above, but staff couldn't fasten the harness around her midriff

As other thrill-seekers looked on from the queue, the shamed mother was forced to step away and watch from the side.

Jackie, of Belper, Derby, said: 'It was so embarrassing and I became really upset when I was not allowed on.

'It was a lovely weekend and it was really busy so everybody could see what was happening.

'When we got home I knew I had to do something about it because I didn’t want to go through it again.'

Jackie, who's grandfather died of heart disease aged just 50, decided to seek professional help.

Doctors told her that she had only ten years 
to live unless she changed her unhealthy lifestyle.

The devastating experience and stark warning about her health inspired the teaching assistant to change her lifestyle.

Inspired: The embarrassing incident in 2011 sparked Jackie into action and she has since lost seven stones

Life-changing: Jackie was forced to act after doctors told her that she may only have 10 years to live

She ditched fried meals and chocolate treats to light salads and zero fat meals since the incident in 2011 and has since lost six-and-a-half stone.

Jackie said: 'I virtually tried to starve myself by just hardly eating anything. It was entirely the wrong thing to do and didn’t work at all.

'I didn’t want my children to be without a mum, so when I saw a banner for a Slimming World group in Belper I went for it. I’ve not looked back since.

'I’ve even been on rollercoasters since with the children at Thorpe Park and really had a great time again.

'I feel like a different person and we’ve all benefited as a family through eating better. It’s made us happier as well.

'I’ve been so inspired I now want to help others because, if I can do it, anybody can.'

She has been so encouraged by the group’s support and diet that she is now launching her own group.

Breakfast: Lots of toast with jam and butter

Dinner: Sandwiches with crisps, yoghurts and chocolate bars

Tea: Fried meals with chips. Always with slices of bread on the side

Breakfast: Brown bread toast, cereals or fruit.

Dinner: Salad with pasta.

Tea: Salmon with pasta and salad and, on occasions, Slimming World chips.
