It's that time of year again and some of the world's best footballers have been joining in the Halloween festivities.

Cesc Fabregas was out and about trick-or-treating with his girlfriend Daniella Semaan and daughter Lia with a Scream mask on.

His Chelsea team-mate Oscar, meanwhile, showed his daughter Julia Emboaba's witch costume off on Twitter.

Interestingly, Stoke City's Peter Crouch and Real Madrid's Gareth Bale both shared similar costumes for the occasion.

Both dressed up in skeleton outfits, with Crouch's wife Abbey Clancy posting a picture of the former England forward before his night out.

Elsewhere, Queens Park Rangers forward Charlie Austin - who netted twice during the 2-0 victory over Aston Villa on Monday - dressed up as a zombie.

The striker wore his QPR tracksuit but used makeup and fake blood to complete his costume.
