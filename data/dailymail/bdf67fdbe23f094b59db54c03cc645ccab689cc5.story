The astonishing greed of bankers was laid bare last night as it was revealed their salaries soared by more than a third last year.

While the rest of the nation coped with an unprecedented squeeze on incomes, City workers were enjoying the high life, with the top 2,700 taking home an average of £1.6million each.

The figure – which makes Britain’s financial elite the highest paid in Europe – flies in the face of the banks’ repeated claims that they have scaled down enormous pay rewards in the wake of the financial crisis.

Allegations: Last night there were claims the sector had learned nothing from the financial crash

Last night there were claims that the sector had learned nothing from the greatest financial crash for decades – a crisis that their own greed and incompetence was in part to blame for.

The figures also follow a string of  scandals at the country’s lenders over mis-selling, failing to help struggling small businesses, and rigging lending rates. Campaigners said that while City salaries have soared, ordinary families are still facing the worst squeeze on household income in living memory.

Average workers saw wages rise by a minuscule 0.8 per cent last year, well below the rate of inflation.

But figures from City-based watchdog the European Banking Authority show that last year 2,714 ‘high earners’ received salary, bonus and pension packages worth at least £830,000.

Soaring salaries: The average pay reward for workers in the City was £1.6million, up from £1.2million in 2011

This is 12 times the number in any other EU country.

The average pay reward was £1.6million, up from £1.2million in 2011. By contrast, there are just 212 euro-millionaire bankers in Germany, and their average pay was £1.3million, almost a fifth less than their counterparts in the UK.

Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of campaign group the High Pay Centre, said the report made a mockery of the banks’ claims to have reined in lavish payouts.

‘This goes to prove that the idea that banks are cutting back is a lie,’ she said.

‘They claim they are showing restraint – but everyone else is suffering from cuts in living standards while bankers are living the high life.’ John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘The banks are failing to lend and giving themselves staggering increases in pay. This is despite the fact that the reason they are doing well is because of quantitative easing – in other words taxpayers lending them money.’

The City watchdog has begun an industry-wide inquiry into banks’ lending to small businesses, after claims of ‘unscrupulous’ practices at Royal Bank of Scotland.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it will look at claims that state-backed RBS forced some business customers into collapse to seize their assets. RBS denies the claims.

The regulator said it will also write to other banks ‘seeking confirmation that they are satisfied they do not engage in any of the poor practices’.

The Bank of England said net lending to business fell by £1.2billion in October – reversing a £714million rise in September.

Dominic Hook of Unite said it showed that fictional Wall Street villian Gordon Gekko was ‘alive and well and living in the City of London’. The huge pay rises come despite bank bosses repeatedly insisting they have cleaned up their culture in an effort to win back the public’s trust.

RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said last year: ‘Pay is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years.’

And addressing shareholders at its annual general meeting earlier this year, Barclays chairman Sir David Walker said: ‘It is without question that in Barclays, and more widely in the banking industry, pay became excessive.’

But critics say the figures show that behind the scenes bankers are intent on carrying on paying themselves just as much as before the crisis, if not more. Experts said the generous increase in bonuses was partly fuelled by the Government’s money printing stimulus – quantitative easing – which has helped push up share prices. Bonuses are typically  paid partly in bank shares, which rose sharply last year.

The six and seven-figure banker bonuses have also put the City on course for a showdown with Brussels because the awards breach strict limits on payouts which will be introduced next year. The highest earners in the UK have been  bagging bonuses averaging 3.7 times their basic salary.

That is well above a new European Union-wide cap that will limit them to a maximum of one year’s annual salary, or an upper limit of two years’ salary if shareholders approve.

Criticism: Jonn Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury Select Committee (left), said bankers were giving themselves pay rises while taxpayers lent them money and RBS Chairman Sir Philip Hampton claimed last year that 'Pay is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years'

Despite public anger over boardroom greed, the Government has lodged a legal challenge against the EBA bonus cap with the European Court of Justice. It fears the banks will respond to a cap by pushing up basic pay for top staff.

Banks have complained they will lose staff to non EU and US rivals which do not have similar pay restrictions if the bonus cap is introduced.

Industry lobby groups defended the pay rises. Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK, said: ‘London is the world’s leading financial centre. That means we attract the best people around the world to the UK. It would be unfortunate if the City were to lose this mantle, because we’d lose the tax that companies and individuals pay.’
