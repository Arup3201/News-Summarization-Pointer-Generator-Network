David Cameron last night urged wobbling European leaders not to go soft on Vladimir Putin in the wake of a ‘ceasefire’ in Ukraine.

At an EU summit in Brussels, the Prime Minister insisted Europe must stand firm in maintaining sanctions against Russia.

His comments came after the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany reached a deal to end the spiralling bloodshed in the region after a tense 17 hours of negotiations.

Under the agreement in Minsk, a ceasefire will begin on Sunday and heavy weapons will be pulled back from the conflict zones in eastern Ukraine, with a buffer zone created between the frontlines.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the deal offered a ‘glimmer of hope’. However Mr Cameron adopted a more sceptical tone on last night’s apparent diplomatic breakthrough. 

'If this is a genuine ceasefire, then of course that would be welcome,’ he said. ‘But what matters most of all is actually actions on the ground rather than just words on a piece of paper.

‘I think we should be very clear that [Russian President] Putin needs to know that unless his behaviour changes, the sanctions we have in place won’t be altered.’

However former British army chief Lord Dannatt told the Mail the deal was a ‘huge gain’ for Putin.

He said there will now be two days of ‘frantic land grabbing’ from the separatists in Ukraine, who have ‘established territory’.

UK officials agreed the ‘ceasefire’ should be treated with caution until there was proof that Putin meant to pull back. ‘We need to send a clear signal,’ said one British diplomat.

Several countries – including Greece, whose new far-Left government has been cosying up to Moscow – are understood to be seeking to unpick the embargoes put in place when Putin invaded Crimea. 

Meanwhile, fighting continued in eastern Ukraine last night as 50 tanks and 40 armoured vehicles crossed the border, Ukrainians claimed.
