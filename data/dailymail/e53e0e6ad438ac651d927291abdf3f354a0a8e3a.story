He claimed to be a journalism graduate and an experienced writer for rock magazines NME and Kerrang - not forgetting his experience in human resources, bar work and music tuition.

But it turned out Jack Francis Dean, with his 10 GCSEs and four A-Levels, wasn’t even a real person - instead, he was a fake identity for Jeremy Forrest, as the teacher looked for French bar work.

Mr Forrest, 30, who sparked a massive police operation after running off to France this month with schoolgirl Megan Stammers, 15, was trapped by police after a bar manageress recognised him.

CV: Jack Dean, who had '10 GCSEs, four A-Levels and a journalism degree from Northampton University', was a fake identity for Jeremy Forrest, the teacher who ran away with Megan Stammers

The CV suggested he had a 2:1 BA degree in journalism from Northampton University in 2008, after studies at Crown Woods College in Eltham, south-east London, had brought him four A-Levels.

It claimed he had achieved a B in English literature, a C in history, a D in general studies and a C in maths - the subject he taught at Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

The CV stated he had GCSEs in maths (A), English language (A), English literature (A), history (A), music (A), double science (B), religious education (B), French (C) and design and technology (D).

It also said he was an employee at the Rising Sun pub in Eltham - and also as a human resources administrator in London for IPC Media, publisher of magazines such as Marie Claire and TV Times.

Found: It was Mr Forrest's application to work at an English pub in Bordeaux - the HMS Victory (pictured), staffed by English and Irish workers and popular with expats - which is said to have blown his cover

The CV described him as ‘a keen writer and musician’ who had been ‘writing freelance articles for music magazines’ such as NME, Rock Sound, Big Cheese and Kerrang since 2008.

Jack Francis Dean's CV

In real life, Mr Forrest was known as a keen musician who played the guitar in a band in his spare time and had a MySpace page. His favourite group was said to be Nineties rock band Nirvana.

The CV added that Mr Dean had taught beginners’ guitar at university and had ‘played gigs across the UK since 2004’. The CV also listed a French Hotmail email address and a French phone number.

But it was Mr Forrest's application to work at an English pub in Bordeaux - the HMS Victory, staffed by English and Irish workers and popular with expats - which is said to have blown his cover.

The manageress recognised him as Mr 
Forrest, rather than Mr Dean, and suggested he returned the following 
day. In the meantime she contacted police and later identified him from 
other photos.

'He
was arrested when looking for work to extend his stay in France a 
little longer in a country that is perhaps a little more understanding'

Sussex Police officers, already aware 
of rumours that the couple were in Bordeaux, flew there on Thursday for 
the trap. Officers waited from early on Friday and detained Mr Forrest 
at lunchtime.

Mr Forrest’s 
French lawyer, Daniel Lalane, said: ‘He was arrested when looking for 
work to extend his stay in France a little longer in a country that is 
perhaps a little more understanding.‘

The lawyer added that Forrest was 'very disappointed by the brutal ending of his love story'.

After
the arrest Megan was taken into protective custody, and returned to 
London Gatwick Airport on a 3.15pm easyJet flight yesterday for an 
emotional reunion with her family.

Mr Forrest is still in love with Megan and wants to be extradited from France so he will be closer to her, his lawyer said today. 

The 30-year-old is currently being held in a remand prison after being arrested in Bordeaux on Friday. Megan flew back to the UK yesterday after more than a week on the run.

Daniel Lalanne, his French lawyer, said: ‘We have discussed how he feels about being taken back to Britain and he will not contest it.’

‘This is primarily because going home will take him back closer to the person he loves.

‘His only crime is to have fallen in love with a 15-year-old, without any recourse to violence or manipulation. Of course he is devastated and only wants to be reunited with Megan.’ 

Forrest will appear in court in Bordeaux on Tuesday for formal extradition proceedings.

He confessed the couple had planned to 'lie low' in Bordeaux for another six months - when they could legally return to the UK as lovers when Megan turned 16.

Hotel staff now concede there was something unusual about the couple. For instance, Mr Forrest left Megan waiting outside, her arms sheepishly folded, while he checked in, paying €61 cash up front.

‘He seemed calm and relaxed; but I never saw her close up,’ said a hotel worker.

Police are now investigating how the passport belonging to mother-of-five Mrs Wilson came into her daughter’s hands – and how the teenager managed to pass herself off as 37 years old.

They went to Paris but soon dumped Mr Forrest’s Ford Fiesta and boarded a TGV train at Montparnasse station then travelled to Bordeaux, 400 miles away in the south-west of the country.

Once there, they were not required to show their passports when they checked into the Choiseul, a two-star hotel which stands half way down the Rue Huguerie in central Bordeaux.

They stayed just one night and, then, after repeatedly moving hotels, Mr Forrest - who had been scrupulous about remaining anonymous - made the crucial error when applying for the bar job.

Earlier this year Mr Forrest had spent six days  in Los Angeles with 50 pupils and five other teachers from the Bishop Bell school.

It was on that trip that pupils were reportedly shocked to see Mr Forrest holding hands with Megan as they sat together on the flight home.

Further details have emerged about the group’s itinerary, which began on February 11 when they checked into the £100-a-night Sportsmen’s Lodge Hotel which, in Hollywood’s golden era, hosted stars such as Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn.

Megan was given Room 229, on the first floor, sharing with three friends. Mr Forrest was close by in Room 211 with another male teacher.

The trip included a tour of Disneyland and Universal Studios, a visit to Warner Bros and Sony Studios, and a stroll along the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

They visited the millionaires’ shopping playground of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, walked on Venice Beach, and explored the legendary Sunset Strip.

Staff at the Lodge remembered Forrest as friendly and capable but did not notice Megan among the other students.
