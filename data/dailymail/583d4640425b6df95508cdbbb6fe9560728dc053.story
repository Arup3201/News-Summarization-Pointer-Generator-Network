A boat once used by Germany’s Luftwaffe for navigation training ran aground during a race around the Isle of Wight.

The 41ft classic yacht Sea Scamp became stranded on a receding tide on a ledge at about 7pm last night.

Rescue crews came to the aid of the Bermudan-rigged sloop but the crew of six had to wait until the early hours of this morning until high tide to refloat.

Marooned: The 41-foot classic yacht Sea Scamp became stranded on a ledge at about 7pm last night as the tide came in

The yacht had been participating in the clockwise direction race for classic yachts which had started earlier in the day from Cowes.

It ran aground on Quarry Ledge, near Thorness Bay and Cowes and Yarmouth RNLI came to the aid with support from Needles Auxiliary Coastguard.

Rescue crews used the yacht’s anchor to help stabilise the stricken boat and left the scene once the boat was secure.

The rescue dinghy returned after midnight this morning to ensure the boat refloated safely and then escorted it back to Cowes.

It was due to be inspected for damage today to see whether it could return to its base at Shamrock Quay, Southampton, Hampshire.

A Nazi accident: It was one of five built for the Luftwaffe in 1936 by the premier boatyard Abeking and Rasmussen to aid pilots with navigation training

Photographer Owen Buggy, 30, from Cowes, captured the scenes while walking his dog.

He said: 'I had just taken my camera in case there was a nice sunset when I spotted a group of very annoyed sailors.

'Somehow, they had managed to run 
aground during the race. They were pretty fed up but resigned to the 
fact it just happens sometimes.

'I think they were more annoyed at the fact that the they were going to be stuck for seven hours until the tide came back in.

'It’s
a beautiful old yacht with some fascinating history. Fortunately no-one
was injured but I think the crew’s pride may have taken a hit.'

Originally named Zeisig, which means ‘Siskin,’ Sea Scamp was built in Germany and for eight years was used for sail training and recreation by German armed forces.

It was one of five built for the Luftwaffe in 1936 by the premier boatyard Abeking and Rasmussen to aid pilots with navigation training.

In 1945, the British forces found some 200 yachts in German harbours, and took them as prizes of war.

Called the 'windfall' yachts, they were sailed to England and distributed to service units all over the world.

Thousands of British servicemen were trained to sail in them.

Since 1984 it has been owned and sailed by the Sea Scamp Syndicate.

The ledge where it went aground is very close to the remains of the PLUTO pipeline which was laid in 1944 to pump fuel to France for the D-Day invasion.
