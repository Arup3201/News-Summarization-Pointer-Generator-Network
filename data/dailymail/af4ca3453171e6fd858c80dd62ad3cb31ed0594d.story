Chelsea's preparations for the Premier League season were dealt a blow as Didier Drogba limped off less than 30 minutes into his first start since returning to the club, as Jose Mourinho's side rounded off their pre-season tour of Europe with a hard-fought win against Ferencvaros.

The former Ivory Coast international went down clutching his ankle midway through the first half and had to be replaced by Oscar after 28 minutes. Chelsea were already behind at the point, due to the left boot of former Fulham playmaker Zoltan Gera.

Ramires equalised for the visitors with an impressive dipping strike early in the second half, before substitute Cesc Fabregas netted his second goal for the Blues with a stunning individual effort nine minutes from time.

Goal: Ramires 51, Fabregas 81

The Blues lined up without goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois due to a minor injury problem, with Petr Cech starting in his place, but Mourinho fielded an otherwise strong side with just eight days to go until their Premier League opener against Burnley.

In Istanbul on Friday, Chelsea beat Fenerbahce 2-0 and lost 1-0 to Besiktas in 45-minute games - and Mourinho would have been pleased to see better from his charges as they edge closer to both full fitness and the start of the competitive season.

Andre Schurrle was dangerous for the Blues in the early stages of the game, setting up Drogba with some neat footwork inside the box and then forcing Dibusz into making a smart stop low to his left with a fizzing shot from the edge of the box.

Chelsea bossed the opening exchanges but it was Ferencvaros that took the lead in the 17th minute, former Fulham and West Brom playmaker Zoltan Gera ghosting in at the back post to smash a volley past  Cech at the back post after a well-worked move  down the right.

Minutes later Drogba went down clutching his ankle after trying to meet a cross inside the Ferencvaros box and though the Ivorian tried to continue his night was curtailed as he limped off with boot in hand to be replaced by Oscar.

Mourinho made six changes at the break with Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa among those introduced, but it was one of those that survived his half-time cull, Ramires, that drew Chelsea level with a fabulous finish from the edge of the area. 

Ramires and Jon Obi Mikel made way for Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic on 61 minutes, and the latter was immediately involved, sprinting back to stop Ferencvaros from bursting into the Chelsea box after the hosts had broken with lightning speed when Gary Cahill's header bounced back off the right-hand post.

The visitors looked the more likely to score a winner in the closing stages as their exciting attacking trio of Fabregas, Costa and Hazard caused problems in the Ferencvaros penalty area, and nine miuntes before the end they got their goal.

Fabregas cut in from the right-hand side, bewitched three Ferencvaros defenders with some quick feet, and then hooked a right-foot finish past Dibusz to make it 2-1.
