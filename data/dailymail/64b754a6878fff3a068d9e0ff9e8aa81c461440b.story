Christmas just isn't Christmas without a turkey in the oven, the Queen's message on TV – and a cookbook by Jamie Oliver in your stocking.

The 36-year-old chef has topped the seasonal bestseller chart for the fourth time in ten years with Jamie's Great Britain.

He has sold 319,217 copies of the book, which accompanies the Channel 4 series of the same name, in the past three months.  

Fourth festive No 1: Jamie Oliver landed the Christmas number one in 2010, 2005 and 2001

Industry experts predicted the book would be the Christmas number one as early as September with bookmakers slashing the odds to 1/2.

Despite the £30 price tag, demand shows no sign of slowing and the book is expected to sell well into the New Year.

Last year Jamie's 30 Minute Meals became the fastest and best-selling book in UK history.

He also claimed the Christmas number one spot in 2001 with his book Happy Days with the Naked Chef and again in 2005 with Jamie's Italy.

His latest book is not proving quite the same runaway success as 30 Minute Meals but he is still comfortably ahead of the second placed book. In the last week alone, Oliver's book has sold 59,156 copies, compared to 55,392 for Guinness World Records 2012, according to official figures released by sales analysts Nielsen BookScan.

Cookery proved an enduring Christmas favourite with TV chefs Lorraine Pascale and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall also featuring in the top ten.

Former model Miss Pascale, who made her name on the BBC with her show on baking, secured fourth place with her book Home Cooking Made Easy.

Christmas bestsellers

Channel 4 star 
Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage Veg Every Day was inspired by his
brief stint as a vegetarian, and has been in the bestseller list since 
its release in mid-September.   

Bizarrely,
the third most popular choice this Christmas is Where's The Meerkat? by
Paul Moran, which is loosely inspired by the Where's Wally books and 
the growing popularity of meerkats, which star in a series of car 
insurance commercials.

The only adult fiction title in the Christmas top ten is The Help by Kathryn Stockett which is at number five.

The book follows the lives of African-American maids working in Mississippi during the 1960s.

First published last year, it has sold more than 850,000. It has enjoyed a boost over the festive period because the film version is now in cinemas.

Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs, the biography of the Apple founder, also experienced a sales boom which propelled it into the top ten.

The sixth instalment from the Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise by Jeff Kinney – entitled Cabin Fever – was the only other work of fiction in the Christmas chart.

The seasonal bestseller list also features two TV tie-in titles – Frozen Planet, which accompanies the controversial BBC series, and The World of Downton Abbey.

Billed as the comprehensive guide to the quintessentially English series created by Sir Julian Fellowes, it features behind-the -scenes insights, interviews with the actors, and in-depth information on costumes, props and the history of the stately home used in the hit ITV series.
