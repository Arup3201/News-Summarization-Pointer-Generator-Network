Royal Ascot is one of the most 
popular events in the sporting and social calendar, with an annual 
attendance of nearly 300,000 people.

Getting - appropriately - dressed up is part of the experience, at least it was until recent years 
when standards started to slip and spaghetti straps, mini skirts and - shock horror - fascinators began showing up in the Royal 
Enclosure.

In a bid to 
reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event, which starts on June 17 and runs until the 21st, the bosses at Ascot
 introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 and they're still going strong.

Inspiration: Royal Ascot have released some inspiring shots to help men and women adhere to this year's dress code

Tightening up: In a bid to reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event, the bosses at Ascot introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 and, judging by these campaign shots, they're still going strong

Now the folks at Royal Ascot have 
unveiled their dress code and styled some looks compliant with it to 
inspire racegoers. Ladies and gentleman, take note.

'A day at Royal Ascot is very special and dressing accordingly is an important part of the experience,' states the guide.

If you're lucky enough to snag a seat in the Royal Enclosure, you're reminded that dresses and skirts should be of 'modest length' - defined as falling just above the knee or longer - and should have straps of one inch or greater.

Hats are, of course, compulsory but a headpiece which has a base of 4 inches (10cm) 
or more in diameter is acceptable as an alternative and fascinators are strictly forbidden.

She wears the trousers: The style guide explains
 that trouser suits are welcome but they should be of full length and of
 matching material and colour

Elegant: Ladies in the Royal Enclosure are reminded that dresses and skirts should be of 'modest length', like this Gareth Pugh number

Menswear style: A black or grey morning suit, which must include a waistcoat and tie (no cravats), is fitting for the Royal Enclosure, while a suit, shirt and tie are required to enter the Grandstand

As for the men, a black or grey morning suit, which must include a waistcoat and tie (no cravats), a black or grey top hat and black shoes are the order of the day.

Ladies within the main Grandstand enclosure are encouraged to dress in a manner as 'befits a formal occasion' - that translates as wearing a hat at all times, banning strapless dresses and concealing your midriff.  

It's easier for the men who are required to wear a suit with a shirt and tie.

Fashion police: Those who want to veer away from the bod standard dress can experiment with their style by opting for a long pencil skirt and crisp shirt

Speaking about this year's occasion, Royal milliner Jane Taylor said: ‘It’s a brilliant excuse for ladies to dress up and have fun with their outfits and headwear.

‘There
 aren’t many occasions as traditional and formal as Royal Ascot, and 
it's great they keep the bar high with the strict dress code.

'Hats
 have always been a significant part of the event, at Ladies Day in 
particular, so it's wonderful to see so many on show during the week and
 in particular women having fun with them!

‘I’m
 really pleased the dress code was updated recently, as its given ladies
 a push to make their hat the most important element of the outfit. ‘Its a wonderful opportunity to show off your style, and keep such an established tradition alive.

‘Part
 of the charm of Ascot is the quintessentially British aspect of it, 
which means we can take pride in our choice of outfits and hats. Its 
wonderful to see so many people looking so elegant.

Have some fun with fashion: Speaking about this year's occasion, Royal milliner Jane Taylor said: 'It's a brilliant excuse for ladies to dress up and have fun'

attends Ascot every year, could not hide her delight as her horse 
Estimate romped home to win the trophy at last year's event

Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice also attended the racing event last year and seemed to enjoy it as much as their grandmother

How it's done: Princess Eugenie, left, and singer Pixie Lott, right, show us how to dress for the races

How NOT to do it: The rules have become stricter year on year as women fail to meet the requirements

important part of the experience. The dress code set out below is
