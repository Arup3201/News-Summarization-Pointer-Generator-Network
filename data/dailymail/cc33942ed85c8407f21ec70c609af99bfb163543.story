A hunter from Maine has shown off his softer side as he managed to deliver a baby porcupine after seeing its mother flattened by a car.

Jared Buzzell was on his way to search for mushrooms with medicinal properties in woods near Minot when he saw the car in front strike the porcupine dead.

At the time of its death, he did not know the animal was pregnant but decide to slice her open in his search for a rare stone found in the animals stomach.

Saved: This cute little fella was found inside his pregnant mother and was saved by a passing motorist on the roads in Maine

Savior: Jarred Buzzell Maine inadvertently delivered a baby porcupine by what amounted to emergency C-section after its mother was killed by car

Attention: Now Jarred has taken it upon himself to look after the baby porcupine and nurse it back to health

First steps: The little animal will be with the Buzzell family for a few more days before being handed over to a rehabilitation center

Time consuming: Baby porcupines require feeding every two to three hours

Jared had been told by his uncle that a valuable mineral forms in a porcupine's stomach, so when he realized the animal was dead, he said he cut it open to have a look inside - and it was then he found a baby Porcupine.

The mineral deposit is called a bezoar stone that forms in the stomach of porcupines.

Hunter: He said he knows the story sounds bizarre, but is glad he checked to see if his uncle's story was true, because it saved the baby animal's life

A bezoar stone, or 'date,' is a tightly packed undigested or partially undigested mineral deposit stuck in the stomach or intestinal tract of animals. They can consist of hairs, fruit and vegetables, seeds or other hardened objects and are used in Chinese herbal medicine, as they are thought to cure a range of illnesses from diabetes to cancer. Bezoar literally means

'antidote' in Persian.

Bezoars were sought because they were believed to have the power of a universal antidote against any poison. It was believed that a drinking glass which contained a bezoar would neutralize any poison poured into it.

Porcupines are herbivores that feast on plants and tree bark. They also love salt and are 'attracted to objects that have salty human sweat on them, such as ax handles, boat oars,' as well as frequently gnaw on dropped deer antlers for minerals.

Hunters are permitted to trap porcupines year-round in Maine, but not permitted to keep them as pets without a license, the Maine Wildlife and Fisheries Department.

Instead of a bezoar stone, Jared found a baby porcupine inside

'I
 cut the sack open and out fell the porcupine. I cut the umbilical cord,
 put it in a hat. We thought it was dead - then I started massaging it 
and all kinds of stuff starting coming out of its lungs so it started 
breathing,' he said.

Jared is now looking after the cuddly creature that he delivered by c-section, until it can be given to animal rescue in the next couple of days.

The baby porcupine requires a great deal of attention and needs to be fed every two to three hours.

He has been using baby formula and his daughter's toy baby doll bottle to help it regain its strength, according to ABC News.

Jared says that he is glad his uncle told him the story about the rare stone because otherwise he would not have bothered to look inside, nor have saved a life.

Although his wife and kids want to keep the adorable animal, Jared believes the 'pocupette' stands the best chance of survival if it is handed over to a wildlife rehabilitator.
