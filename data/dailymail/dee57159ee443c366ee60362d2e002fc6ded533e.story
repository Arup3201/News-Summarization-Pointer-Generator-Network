They say you shouldn't take your work home with you, but the owner of this car is clearly reluctant to ever stray too far from the office.

When traffic police in Germany pulled the driver over for breaking the speed limit, they were stunned to find a mobile workspace set up in the front of his Ford MondeoÂ  - complete with a laptop, printer, and two mobile phones.

The 35-year-old workaholic, who was stopped by police on the autobahn, also had a navigation device, a GPS receiver attached to his windshield, and a voltage converter to power the precarious set-up.

The man was stopped by police who spotted him overtaking another car at 80mph in a 62mph zone.

Officers fined him 120 euro for speeding and 'driving with improperly secured cargo' according to a report in Der Spiegel.
