Foreign lorry drivers are to be charged £10 a day to use British roads, ministers have announced.

The levy is designed to counter the unfairness of UK hauliers paying tolls when driving across the continent.

The tax, which will be capped at £1,000, is expected to raise more than £20million a year.

Ministers say foreign lorries often cause more damage to roads than British hauliers

There are around 1.5 million trips by foreign registered HGVs in to the UK every year.

Ministers claim foreign lorries are likely to cause more damage to British roads and they should make a contribution to their upkeep.

Complex rules mean British lorry drivers will have also have to pay the HGV Road User Levy but will receive a rebate in the form of a cut to vehicle excise duty.

Transport minister Stephen Hammond 
said: ‘The Government believes that it is right that vehicles which 
cause wear to our roads should make a payment to take account of this.

‘HGVs registered abroad are likely to carry more weight on fewer axles than UK registered vehicles.

'This means that foreign-registered vehicles are more damaging to the roads and it's therefore all the more unjust that they don't make a contribution towards the maintenance of the roads they use, leaving the burden to fall entirely on the British taxpayer.’

The levy is expected to raise between £18.7 million and £23.1 million in its first year of operation, starting in April 2014.

Tory MP Andrew Percy warned there are still significant problems for the industry.

He said: ‘It's a delight to know our UK haulage industry will be receiving a shot in the arm from this proposal.

‘There are still considerable challenges faced by the sector. I meet with them regularly and only over the summer was chatting to one local haulage firm who explained to me the particular challenges the sector faces in light of the rising fuel costs.’

He also criticised the "convoluted" process of creating a new levy that applied to British hauliers as well as foreign HGVs to comply with EU rules.

Shadow transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick added: ‘The unfairness dealt to the UK road haulage industry is well documented and they have long pressed for this measure to defend British industry, to protect UK roads and to create a level playing field with their European competitors.’
