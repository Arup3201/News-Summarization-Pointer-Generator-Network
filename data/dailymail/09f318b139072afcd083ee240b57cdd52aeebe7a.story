A nationwide discount clothing chain is under fire for producing 'sexist'  washing instructions on a label.

On a pair of beige chinos sold by Madhouse, the printed label states the standard washing instructions, which is then followed by 'Or give it to your woman: It's her job.'

The trousers which sparked the fury were purchased in London at Madhouse’s flagship Oxford Street store last month.

Courting controversy: On a pair of beige chinos the label states the standard washing instructions, but is then followed by 'Or give it to your woman'

As the news spread, many people took to Twitter to discuss the controversial label.

One user wrote 'How dare #Madhouse this is 2012 not 1950s.'

But one male user wrote 'Personally, I think the "Give it to your woman label" in the Madhouse trousers is funny, and my girlfriend would laugh about it too #relax'

Other users on the social network were more cynical, deciding it was a
 publicity stunt on the brand's part, aimed to gain free advertising.

Backlash: Madhouse, a nationwide discount clothing store is under fire for producing the 'sexist' label washing instructions

Holly Combe, from feminism website, The F Word, commented:

'It
 would be effectively ironic and "just a joke" if it weren't for the 
fact that all too many women do still find that domestic tasks are still
 considered their job, regardless of the employment status of both 
partners.

Instead, I think it's a case of the 
usual double irony, where we have to pretend something is ironic when 
the undercurrent of the joke actually serves to put us in our place and 
persuade us not to offer any critique if we want to be seen to "have a 
sense of humour" ' she added.

Last
 month it was reported that Madhouse had gone into administration, 
putting 700 jobs at risk, although recent reports suggested it has been 
saved by an 'unknown buyer.'

Many clothing retailers have come under fire recently for controversial clothing gaffes.

Offensive: Last year, Topman was forced to apologise and remove a range of t-shirts from shelves after Twitter users said they were sexist. One t-shirt said: 'Nice new girlfriend: what breed is she?'

Removed: Topman was forced to remove hundreds of T-shirts after being accused of promoting sexism

Last year, Topman was forced to apologise and clear its shelves of hundreds of ‘sexist’ T-shirts.

Dozens of customers complained about two designs at Topman, one of which was said to have glamorised domestic violence by listing male excuses such as ‘You provoked me’.

The other T-shirt carried the slogan ‘Nice New Girlfriend: What Breed Is She?’ – prompting complaints that women were being likened to cattle and dogs.

Bad at maths but good at...? Forever 21's offering, left, and JC Penney's, right, have also raised the ire of commentators who deem the shirt designs offensive

One shopper wrote a message on the chain’s website, saying: ‘Apparently Topman think domestic violence makes a hilarious T-shirt slogan.’

Another posted: ‘Let’s glamorise domestic violence, shall we? Topman you should be ashamed of yourselves.’

The T-shirts were also condemned by campaigners.

Forever 21 came under fire in September for releasing a football-style T-shirt for girls emblazoned with the slogan 'Allergic to Algebra.'

The LA-based retailer soon removed the controversial tee from stores.

In August, JC Penney has been forced to back down over a slogan sweatshirt after the blogosphere went into overdrive over its apparently demeaning message.

The white top read 'I'm too pretty to do homework, so my brother has to do it for me' and was aimed at 7-16 year olds.

Some claimed the retail giant's apology over the misjudged top to be a 'women's rights victory.'
