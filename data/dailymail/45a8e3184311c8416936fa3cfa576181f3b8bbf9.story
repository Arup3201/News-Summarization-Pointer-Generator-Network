Marie Watton stabbed Jonathan Barras after he told her she was 'fit' in a pub in Telford, Shropshire

A woman who stabbed a man in the stomach because he told her she was 'fit' has been told to expect a lengthy prison sentence by a judge.

Marie Watton, 25, was so offended when Jonathan Barras complemented her looks she stabbed him in the abdomen after sparking a violent pub brawl.

The woman from Telford, Shropshire, was told to expect a 'double figure' sentence after pleading guilty to wounding with intent in Shrewsbury Crown Court.

A group of Watton's friends attacked the victim in the Duke of York pub after he told her she was attractive on January 16.

Barras punched one of the woman's friends amid the brawl, prompting Watton to go across the road to a friend's house to fetch a kitchen knife.

When she returned, she stabbed the 27-year-old and tore through his liver, kidney and small bowel after seething: 'He is having it now'.

Mr Barras required extensive medical treatment following the incident but has made a full recovery.

Yesterday, Judge Robin Onions told the court: 'He said she was fit, didn't he?

'I though that was a compliment, isn't it?'

Prosecuting Adam Warner said there was a 'significant degree of premeditation' to Watton's crime.

'There was a remark made to her by Mr Barras to which she took great exception.

'The
CCTV shows her moving towards him at the bar in an extremely aggressive
way, and it looks in all the world that she has in fact headbutted him.

'She did not, but fighting broke out and she took an active part.

The 25-year-old went to a friend's nearby home to retrieve a kitchen knife before slicing through the victim's organs

'Mr Barras punched Matty Warrender, a friend of Wattonâ€™s, hard on the nose and there was blood everywhere.

'Marie Watton saw that and immediately said "he is having it now"'.

Though the kitchen knife was never found, a bloodstained leather jacket worn by Watton on the night in question was discovered by police in her loft.

She was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on January 6.
