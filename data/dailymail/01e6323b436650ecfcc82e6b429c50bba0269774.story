The parents of a woman who died on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 travelled from Perth, Australia to honor their daughter at the crash site in eastern Ukraine.

Jerzy Dyczynski and Angela Rudhart-Dyczynski, parents of 25-year-old Fatima, crossed territory held by pro-Russian rebels to reach the wreckage-strewn farm fields outside the village of Hrabove.

They last spoke to Fatima shortly before she boarded the flight for Kuala Lumpur in Amsterdam on July 17.

Jerzy Dyczynski and his wife  Angela Rudhart-Dyczynski flew to Ukraine from Australia to see the site where their daughter Fatima died on board the doomed aircraft

Mr Dyczynski, right, along with his wife Angela, left were able to wander trough the debris field without being stopped by rebels who still control the site

Mr and Mrs Dyczynski became clearly emotional as they walked through the scene, inspecting the aircraft's wreckage searching for any sign of their daughter Fatima

Mrs Rudhart-Dyczynski said, 'We have promised our daughter we will come here.'

Her husband added that his daughter 'was for peace. She will be forever for peace.'

The Boeing 777-200 twin-engined passenger jet was shot down by pro-Russian separatists more than a week ago. 

Meanwhile,two cargo planes have flown 38 more coffins carrying victims of the Malaysia Airlines disaster out of eastern Ukraine to a forensic centre in the Netherlands for identification and investigation.

Mr Dyczynski said he had to travel to Ukraine with his wife after making a promise to their daughter Fatima who was among the 298 casualties onboard MH17

The Royal Netherlands Air Force returned a further 38 bodies to Holland earlier today where they will undergo a forensic examination in a bid to identify the remains 

Soldiers could be seen carrying coffins with the remains of the victims of MH17 from a plane and into a waiting hearse at Eindhoven military airport today. It is the fourth day that Dutch and Australian transporter planes have brought the bodies from Charkov to the Netherlands, where the formal identification process will be carried out

Friends and relatives of the 298 victims of MH17 have laid thousands of floral tributes outside the main terminal building at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam 

The planes took off from Kharkiv, a government-controlled city where the bodies have been brought from the crash site in territory held by pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian government.

US and Ukrainian officials believe the plane was shot down by a missile from rebel territory, likely by mistake.

Officials said the flights took the last of the victims that have been brought to Kharkiv, while international observers said there are still remains at the crash site.

Access has been limited due to rebel interference and security concerns.

The aircraft's two black boxes have been transferred from rebel-held territory to experts at the Air Accident Investigation Branch in Farnborough, Hampshire. 

Russian leader Vladimir Putin has faced severe international criticism for his failure to withdraw ongoing support to rebels in Ukraine.

After being flown into Eindhoven military airport in the Netherlands, the coffins were transported in hearses which drove in convoy to a nearby forensic centre

The hearses, led by officials on motorbikes, took the coffins to a forensic centre where formal identification of the victims will be carried out

Ukrainian forces have advanced to the outskirts of a key town north of Donetsk, officials said today, as they try to retake the stronghold held for months by pro-Russia rebels.

The move comes as Ukrainian forces appear to have gained some momentum recently by retaking control of territory from the rebels.

But Russia also appears to becoming more involved in the fighting, with the U.S. and Ukraine accusing Moscow of moving heavily artillery across the border to the rebels.

Ukrainian national security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces were outside Horlikva, just north of the regional centre of Donetsk.

'The direct route is open for the forces of the anti-terrorist operation to the capital of the Donbass region - the city of Donetsk,' Lysenko said.

'The approaches to Donetsk are being blocked so that the terrorists do not get the chance to receive ammunition, reinforcements or equipment.'

Donetsk, a city of about 1 million people, is a major center of the separatist uprising that has battled Ukrainian government forces for five months.

Russia reacted angrily on Saturday to additional sanctions imposed by the European Union over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis, saying they would hamper cooperation on security issues and undermine the fight against terrorism and organised crime.

Russia's Foreign Ministry also accused the United States, which has already imposed its own sanctions against Moscow, of contributing to the conflict in Ukraine through its support for the pro-Western government in Kiev.

The 28-nation EU reached an outline agreement on Friday to impose the first economic sanctions on Russia over its behaviour in Ukraine but scaled back their scope to exclude technology for the crucial gas sector.

The EU also imposed travel bans and asset freezes on the chiefs of Russia's FSB security service and foreign intelligence service and a number of other top Russian officials, saying they had helped shape Russian government policy that threatened Ukraine's sovereignty and national integrity.

'The additional sanction list is direct evidence that the EU countries have set a course for fully scaling down cooperation with Russia over the issues of international and regional security,' Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

'(This) includes the fight against the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction, terrorism, organised crime and other new challenges and dangers.'

'We are sure such decisions will be accepted with enthusiasm by global terrorists,' the ministry added.
