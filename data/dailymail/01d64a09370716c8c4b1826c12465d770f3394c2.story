Leighton Baines insists that Everton have turned a corner by no longer selling their best players as the club look to challenge for a top four finish.

The England defender was courted by Manchester United last season but stayed to help the club finish a creditable fifth in the Premier League.

And, manager Roberto Martinez has managed to ignore the advances of other clubs for his leading players while making some impressive signings during the close season.

New dawn: Everton are no longer a selling club says defender Leighton Baines (L)

Big statement: Everton have broken their transfer record to sign Romelu Lukaku (C) for up to £28m

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Baines said: 'What the club has done lately is retain its best players.

'Everyone here who has been linked with someone has stayed and committed to the club. The younger lads; Ross, Stonesy, Seamus have all been linked with clubs and they've all got their best football ahead of them, but they're all happy to do it here. That's as big as anything for me.

'The manager was telling me that's what he wanted to do when I signed my contract.

'I signed following that summer of the whole United thing, but that was in their minds back then in terms of how to change the status and perception so we can keep hold of players when other clubs come calling.'

Martinez has continued his revolution by bringing in high quality signings including Gareth Barry, a loan deal for Chelsea youngster Christian Atsu and breaking the club's transfer record for Romelu Lukaku.

'It was a big statement,' he says. 

Forward planning: Roberto Martinez has tied down young prospects like John Stones to long-term deals

'Rom was linked to loads of clubs and I think the Chelsea fans would have liked to have him back there as well. So it was a brilliant signing for us. 

'Everyone is back now and I think the gaffer will be working on another couple of things he wants to do, but it's great to have Rom back and Gaz (Barry) as well.'
