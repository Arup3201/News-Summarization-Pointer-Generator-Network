A Romanian man has been arrested on suspicion of ferrying eight suspected illegal immigrants across the English Channel in an inflatable boat.

Border Force officers intercepted eight suspected illegal immigrants just five miles from Dover when their boat broke down and was drifting dangerously close to shipping lanes.

It is believed that the Romanian national tried to sneak the eight Afghan men under the cover of darkness into Britain when the 50hp engine on board his inflatable boat ran out of fuel.

The RNLI found the rigid inflatable boat was located by the RNLI about five miles from the port of Dover in Kent after receiving a report from a passing cross channel ferry fearing it was going to drift into busy shipping lanes

Crew aboard a passing P&O ferry alerted the Coastguard after spotting the small craft in difficulty at 6.40am yesterday.

The RNLI and Border Force raced to the scene, approximately five miles from the port of Dover in Ken to tow the stricken boat to safety.Â 

The rescue team managed to bring the boat ashore at 9.55am, when the Romanian man was arrested on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration.

RNLI Dover Lifeboat spokesman Tony Hawkins said: 'The vessel had suffered engine failure and its occupants were drifting in choppy seas with a force four wind blowing.

'They were spotted by passing vessels concerned for their safety which called the Coastguard. The occupants were cold but didn't need medical attention.

'They were lucky. They were drifting in an incredibly busy stretch of water with the wind picking up. We're glad everyone is safe and well.'

The Romanian man was believed to have been trying to smuggle the eight Afghans into Britain under the cover of darkness when the 50hp outboard motor ran out of fuel, leaving the boat drifting in force four winds

He said when they arrived the crew set up a tow to the immigrants' boat and waited for a Border Force vessel to arrive.

The Border Force cutter vessel then took over the tow and brought the boat and its nine occupants to Dover lifeboat station, with the RNLI crew providing an escort.

A ship worker, who witnessed the drama, said: 'This is the first time I've ever seen a craft like this make it across the Channel. They obviously made a great attempt to get across one of the most dangerous shipping routes in the world.

'You might say they were very brave but also very foolish as they could have died.

'They could easily have been run over by a large tanker and they must have set off during darkness so it was incredibly risky.

'We saw them and then we saw the lifeboat coming out to them. They're lucky to have been rescued.'

The condition of the nine people is thought to be ok. There was no call for any medical assistance and they all appeared to be well.

Immigration Enforcement Officers have launched a criminal investigation after the attempted channel crossing

A Border Force spokesperson said: 'Border Force is aware of an incident off the coast of Dover involving an inflatable craft carrying suspected illegal immigrants.

'One Romanian male has been arrested on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration and eight Afghani nationals have been detained.

'A criminal investigation has been launched by Immigration Enforcement officers.'

They were being kept in custody at a police station in Dover and are likely to be taken later to an immigration detention centre, although the Romanian man faces possibly being charged and appearing in court.

This is a repeat of a similar incident which happened on June 6 when a Mongolian man was rescued from the middle of the English Channel trying to paddle to England in a rubber dinghy.

He was spotted in a 4ft long blue inflatable kayak by a fishing boat eight miles from shore.

His craft was described as being similar to those stocked by Decathlon which has a store in Calais.
