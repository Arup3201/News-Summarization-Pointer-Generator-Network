Ed Balls today hit back at former Cabinet colleague Peter Mandelson over claims Labour wanted to 'clobber' the rich with new mansion taxes – but refused to say exactly how much people can expect to pay under the levy.

The shadow chancellor said he 'promised' the tax on homes worth more than £2million would not be implemented in a 'crude' way and would raise £1.2billion a year for the NHS.

He said people with homes worth between £2million and £3million would have to pay £250 a month - but he refused to reveal how much people would have to pay if they owned properties worth any more.

Mr Balls' remarks came after Labour grandee Lord Mandelson last night denounced the flagship policy - claiming it was 'short-termist'.

The former business secretary said he preferred the Liberal Democrats' proposal to extend the council tax system with higher rates for more expensive properties, which he said would be better than 'just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short-term mansion tax.'

But Mr Balls said that revamping council tax would be 'cumbersome and bureaucratic', and said that Labour's scheme in fact met Lord Mandelson's requirement for the levy to be banded.

He sought to reassure those with properties worth just under £2million that this threshold will be regularly uprated in line with luxury house prices, and that HM Revenue and Customs will accept independent valuations obtained by home-owners to determine which side of the line their property falls.

But he refused to set out in detail what those in home worth more than £3million could expect to pay.

The shadow chancellor told BBC Radio 4's World at One: 'I promise you that it won't be crude.

'I don't want to clobber anyone, but I want to make sure that people who are paying too little tax because they are undertaxed in multi-million pound properties - and many of these are foreign owners who don't pay tax at all - pay their fair share to the NHS.'

Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, has described Labour leader Ed Miliband's plan to impose mansion tax as 'crude'

Labour's proposed mansion tax is causing tensions within the party, with strong criticism from many including potential London Mayoral candidates Diane Abbott, Dame Tessa Jowell, David Lammy and Margaret Hodge.

In an interview with BBC Newsnight last night, Lord Mandelson acknowledged: 'We don't have an efficient way of taxing property in Britain.'

But he added: 'I don't happen to think the mansion tax is the right policy response to that, I think it's crude, I think it's short-termist, what we need is what I think the Liberal Democrats are proposing and that is the introduction of further bands that relate to different values of property within the council tax system, that's what I would like to see, it will take longer to introduce, that's true, but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short-term mansion tax.'

Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last year said homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income.

Critics warn the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans.

Labour estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country.

People earning less than £42,000 will be able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands in an effort to protect people, especially in the capital, who have seen the value of their house soar in recent years.

Lord Mandelson said: 'You do need a fair, progressive taxation system where people who are earning the most and accumulating the most wealth pay the most.

'And for very many people they shouldn't pay anything at all, because they simply don't have the incomes, or the wealth, or the assets, to support that.'

The former business secretary said he was not worried about the message being sent out by the mansion tax, but he added: 'I want policy effectiveness, I want efficiency.

'I think people are entitled to expect thought-through, sophisticated responses to serious problems.'

He told Newsnight: 'We have to make sure that what we are doing is, in a sense, recreating the policies that we saw in the Clinton-Blair era, where we saw a pro-business, liberal economic approach but combined with very strong policies and interventions by government in order to create opportunities for individuals and to redistribute income and wealth more fairly.'

In November, Ed Miliband (centre) was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the mansion tax proposal by singer and classical musician Myleene Klass (left) in a heated television debate

Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'With Mandelson joining the chorus of Labour voices opposed to Labour's homes tax, it is clearer than ever that Ed Miliband is a weak leader peddling a bad policy. 

'It is yet more proof that he simply isn't up to the job of running the country.' 

The Liberal Democrat plan, backed by Lord Mandelson, would involve a series of extra bands of taxation for properties worth more than £2million on top of council tax.

Earlier this month, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy caused outrage from within the party after he set out plans to use millions of pounds raised from the tax in England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border.

In November, Mr Miliband was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by Myleene Klass.

The singer and classical musician tore strips out of his pledge during a television debate, telling him that it was 'disturbing'.

'You may as well just tax me on this glass of water,' she told him during the angry exchange. 'You can't just point at things and tax them.'
