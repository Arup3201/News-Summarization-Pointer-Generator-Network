Shoppers across Europe may soon have to pay for plastic bags under planned EU laws designed to reduce litter.

Euro MPs voted in favour of strict targets that would force each country to halve its use of the lightweight disposable bags by 2017 and to cut it by 80 per cent by 2019.

The 28 member states will be allowed to decide themselves how to meet the target – but MEPs suggest they will either have to introduce a charge for the single-use carrier bags, tax shops which give them out for free, or impose a complete ban.

Britons could soon be banned from taking their shopping home in plastic bags after the MEPs approved EU targets

Parliament’s Environment Committee 
yesterday backed a report by the European Commission that would require 
each government to take some form of legislative action to curb free 
handouts of plastic bags.

The
 average EU citizen uses 198 plastic bags a year, the vast majority of 
which are single-use. Critics of plastic bags argue they waste 
resources, contribute to litter, and represent a powerful symbol of the 'throwaway society', and last year the European Commission put forward 
proposals to require member states to enact plastic bag bans, levies, or
 other measures to reduce their use.

MEPs
 have now approved the plans, which aim to halve plastic bag hand-outs 
over three years and then reduce use to 80 per cent of today’s levels by
 the end of the decade.

Every year each EU citizen uses, on average, 200 bags with 8billion of them ending up in seas and rivers

Under the new rules, which still have 
to be voted on by the full European Parliament and backed by the 
European Council, member states would have the option of introducing a 
small levy on plastic bags, as has already been successfully enacted in 
the Republic of Ireland, France, Norway and Spain.

Alternatively, they 
could introduce mandatory plastic bag reduction targets.

The
 legislation would also make it possible for governments to introduce an
 outright ban on plastic bags, without contravening single market rules.

Italy is currently facing legal action from the Commission, after 
launching Europe’s first plastic bag ban in 2011. But that case could be
 dropped if the new proposals get the green light.

However,
 despite the ENVI Committee’s overall support for the plan yesterday, 
Conservative MEPs were strongly opposed to the idea.

Writing on Twitter,
 MEP Vicky Ford questioned if plastic bag use should be within the remit
 of the EU.

It now remains 
to be seen whether the whole Parliament will now approve the plans in 
April, when they are due to be discussed at a Plenary session.

Green
 MEP Margrete Auken had originally proposed a target to reduce plastic 
bag use by 80 per cent over two years, but the Socialists, European 
People’s Party and ALDE group reached a compromise agreement to deliver 
on the target over five years, in the hope that it would be more likely 
to gain majority backing in the plenary vote.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has already set a minimum 5p charge for plastic bags from 2015 in response to the Mail's Banish the Bags campaign

Chris
 Davies, Liberal Democrat MEP and environment spokesman for the party in
 Brussels, accused the Conservative Party of opposing action to tackle a
 serious environmental problem.

'It is clear that we need an EU-wide 
approach to prevent the enormous damage being done by plastic bag waste 
to Europe’s seas and beaches,' he said.

'Plastic bags not only blight 
our landscape, they pose a serious threat to marine wildlife. 
Three-quarters of seabirds and one third of fish in the English Channel 
have been found to be contaminated by plastic waste, much of it from 
plastic bags.

By voting against these proposals, the Tories are sending 
out a clear signal that they don’t care about preserving our marine 
environment for future generations.'

However,
 if the proposals are approved, they are unlikely to have much impact on
 UK policy as the government has already announced plans to introduce a 
five pence charge on single use carrier bags in England in 2015, 
following similar legislation that was successfully introduced in Wales 
and Northern Ireland. Scotland is also planning to introduce a plastic 
bag ban in October this year.
