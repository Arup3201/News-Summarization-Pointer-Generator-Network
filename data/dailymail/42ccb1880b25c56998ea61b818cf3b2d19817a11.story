A would-be doctor murdered in an apparently unprovoked stabbing achieved top grades in his GCSEs, his teacher has revealed.

Ajmol Alom, 16, described as 'one of our brightest prospects' by his headmaster, died after he was wounded in the thigh in Poplar, east London, on August 12.

The teenager, who went to Langdon Park School in Poplar, achieved eight grade As in subjects including maths, science, English literature, geography, religious studies and citizenship; and three B grades in English language, humanities and physical education.

Headteacher Chris Dunne said: 'One of the careers he was considering was in medicine, and these results would have made that a very real possibility in terms of university entrance.

'All the many journalists who interviewed me after the horrifying event of his murder wanted to know how "good" he was as a student. I was able to say without hesitation that he was very able, looking forward to GCSE results at a very high level and very capable of going on to achieve the kind of grades which would have secured him a place at any one of our best universities.'

He said that he had interviewed Ajmol for a place in the school’s new sixth form a few weeks ago, and that he would remember most 'how hardworking he was as a student, and how very decent he was as a person'.

Mr Dunne went on: 'Some youngsters as able as Ajmol don’t ever realise their full potential because they aren’t prepared to do what’s necessary to ensure success. Some are remembered for the way they show off their cleverness at the expense of other, less able students. Ajmol’s approach was the opposite.

'He would always have been the last person to boast of his ability. He regularly attended the extra classes and revision sessions run by his teachers, even when he probably didn’t need their help any longer. His friends could rely on him for help if they needed it, not for arrogance or scorn.'

The teacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in Northern Ireland.

Mr Dunne went on: 'We are constantly bombarded with negative stories about young people, about their poor attitudes and anti-social behaviour. Working in schools and youth clubs for the past 40 years I have learned the opposite, that the vast majority of young people are in fact very decent, and undoubtedly go on to be equally decent adults.

'Our school, our community, our country 
has just lost one of its brightest prospects and we are all rightly 
shocked and depressed by it. The best comfort we can take from it is 
that, for however a short a time, those of us that knew Ajmol knew a 
very splendid young man and a fine citizen.'

Three men have been arrested in connection with the alleged offence.

One, 19-year-old Aminur Khan from Poplar, has been charged with murder and appeared in court on Monday. The two others have been bailed until a date in September.
