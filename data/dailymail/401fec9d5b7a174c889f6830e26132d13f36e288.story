Veteran defender Frank Sinclair admitted he is happy to have left management behind to focus on his playing career... at the grand old age of 43!

Sinclair resigned from his player-manager post at Conference North side Colwyn Bay – after just one win in 13 games – but returned to the pitch on Saturday for fellow seventh tier side Brackley Town.

The former Chelsea defender played the full 90 minutes during the Northamptonshire club's 1-0 win against Harrogate Town on Saturday and Tuesday night's one-all draw with North Ferriby United.

'It's an opportunity to forget managing and coaching.' Sinclair told BBC Sport

'There is a chance to coach at the youth set-up with a League club. And it will probably do me some good as I will have time to reflect.

'I didn't take him seriously so I rang him and he was very serious. They have a few injuries and suspensions so he wanted me to help out.

'I haven't been playing that regularly but have kept myself fit and I know I can do a job and help the young lads.'

Sinclair appeared for Jamaica in the 1998 World Cup and played nearly 500 games in the Premier League and Football League for Chelsea, Leicester, Burnley and Huddersfield.

But, he left Colwyn struggling in 15th and just five points above the relegation zone.

'The last couple of months have been very stressful and I wanted to give the club an opportunity to get someone with different connections and ideas,' he said.

'It didn't go well and it wasn't just down to form. Vital players were out with injuries and we had to play some reserves.'
