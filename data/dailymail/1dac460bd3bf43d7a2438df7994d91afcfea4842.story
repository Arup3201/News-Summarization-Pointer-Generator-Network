Manchester City are showing interest in Keiren Westwood.

The goalkeeper, 29, is a free agent after leaving Sunderland and would aid City's home grown quota.

Sunderland are keen on former City keeper Costel Pantilimon and have revived interest in Hamburg's Rene Adler but the German has damaged knee ligaments.

The Premier League champions have already confirmed the signings of former Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna and are expecting to anounce the signing of Brazilian midfielder Fernando.

Making up the numbers? Keiren Westwood would provide Manchester City with another homegrown player

Sagna has joined City on a free transfe, signing a three-year deal worth Â£150,000-per-weekÂ  - inclusive of add-ons and bonuses.

As revealed exclusively by Sportsmail in May, the 31-year-old will officially join City on July 1 - ending his seven-year spell with the Gunners.

City failed with a bid to sign Fernando in the January transfer window, but appear to have finally landed the Porto midfielder.

Manuel Pellegrini has been interested in the 26-year-old for some time and sees him as the ideal player to assist Yaya Toure and Fernandinho in central midfield next season, as City try to challenge on four fronts.

Done deal! Premier League champions have confirmed the signing of Bacary Sagna, with Fernanod expected too
