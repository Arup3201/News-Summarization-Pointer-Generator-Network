Jailed: Mahdi Mohammed was sentenced to 27 months in prison after he groomed two schoolgirls for sex via Facebook

An Iraqi-born paedophile, who has been jailed for grooming 13-year-old girls for sex via Facebook, avoided deportation in 2005, it has been revealed.

Questions are now being asked about why the UK Border Agency allowed Mahdi Mohammed to seek asylum in Britain after he first appeared in court charged with inappropriately approaching girls as young as ten back in 2005. 

This week Mohammed, 33, was jailed for 27 months after he admitted sexual activity with a child, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, attempting to sexually touch a child and possessing indecent images at Peterborough Crown Court in Cambridgeshire.

Judge Nic Madge described his crimes as ‘sophisticated offending,’ plying schoolgirls with mobile phone top-up vouchers. When he was caught he blamed them for ‘making themselves available’ to him.

Claire Matthews, prosecuting, said Mohammed was seen hanging around a playground in Peterborough where he met two 13-year-old girls on a number of occasions.

He gave them mobile phone top-up vouchers, offered to take them home, and tried to put his hand down one of the girl’s trousers.

He also showed the girls pornographic TV channels and encouraged them to take part in sexual activity.

He sent indecent Facebook messages to one of them and even posted a memory stick to her home and asked her to put pictures of herself on it.

He also sexually touched a 15-year-old in another park and had 19 indecent images of children on his computer.

Lawrence Bruce, defending, said: ‘He came to the UK in 2000, having fled persecution from Saddam Hussein in Iraq.

‘Admitting guilt publicly has been a very difficult process, and has involved the loss of faith, character and reputation.’

After
reading a letter from Mohammed, Judge Nic Madge said: ‘The letter is 
disturbing in two senses.

'Firstly, the account of treatment of your 
family in Iraqi Kurdistan, but also allegations that young girls were 
making themselves available in a sexual manner to you.’

Mohammed first appeared at Peterborough Crown Court in September 2005 when he admitted using inappropriate language towards young girls in the city.

He was sentenced to 80 hours of community punishment and a 12-month rehabilitation order and also got an ASBO banning him from approaching young girls for five years.

At the time, the court was told that Mohammed’s application for asylum had been refused and he would be returned to Iraq.

But the Border Agency confirmed today that he was granted leave to stay in Britain shortly after the case and was legally here when he committed the latest offences.

'Appalling case': Conservative MP Shailesh Vara, said serious questions needed to be asked about why he was allowed to stay since 2005

They refused to say why Mohammed had been allowed to stay in the country.

Shailesh Vara, Conservative MP for North West Cambridgeshire, said: ‘This is an appalling case.

'Serious questions need to be asked as
to why despite the asylum application having previously failed, the UK 
Border Agency allowed him to stay.

‘The sooner this man is deported the better.’

Tory MP for Peterborough Stewart Jackson added that it was ‘appalling’ Mohammed had not been deported in 2005.

He said: ‘This is a shocking case and is typical of the previous government’s lax and dangerous policy of unrestricted immigration.

‘This man should have been removed from the UK in 2005 and the fact that he wasn’t is appalling.

‘I will be writing to the Immigration Minister to ensure that he is permanently removed from our country after his prison sentence is served.’

The Border Agency said that Mohammed would now be deported at the end of his prison sentence.
