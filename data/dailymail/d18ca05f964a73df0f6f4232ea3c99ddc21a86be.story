Fire starter: Sadie Renee Johnson, 23, pleaded guilty last May to starting the fire

A woman who pleaded guilty to tossing a lit firework out of a car and starting a massive wildfire –to help her firefighter mates out who were ‘bored’ has been fined $7million.

Sadie Renee Johnson, 23, pleaded guilty last year for the crime of setting brush and timber on fire on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in north central Oregon.

The wildfire that she started blackened over 51,000 acres and forced widespread evacuations.

According to the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, the approximate cost to fight and contain the wildfire was $7,901,973 -- which she has been ordered to pay back in full.

During
 questioning, Ms Johnson told police that she started the fire because her 
firefighter friends were bored and needed work but she didn’t mean for 
it to be 30,000 acres.

But two days after the fire began, Ms Johnson took to social media site Facebook and posted an entry stating: ‘like my fire?’

She told authorities she thought it would be a two-day fire and be put out.

The
 U.S. Department of Justice said it released details about the case to 
deter others from attempting similar types of reckless behaviour.

According to police, Ms Johnson started the fire at 9.20am on July 20th last year.

Fire: The wildfire that she started eventually blackened over 51,000 acres and forced widespread evacuations

Ablaze: The Sunnyside Turnoff Fire -- grew quickly, ultimately burning about 51,480 acres of brush on the reservation, officials said

She was riding as a passenger in a car on Route 3 near Sunnyside Drive, in Oregon, when she used a lighter to light a small firework.

She then tossed it out of the passenger window into the brush along the side of the road.

The firework lit a brush beside the road on fire, which quickly spread northwest.

The fire was reported about 15 minutes later.

The first responders to the scene identified the point of origin at milepost 5 on the north side of the road, within a 1- to 1.5-acre area.

Within minutes, the fire -- later named the Sunnyside Turnoff Fire -- had grown quickly, ultimately burning about 51,480 acres of brush on the reservation, officials said.

Warning: The fire sparked mass evacuations of dozens of homes

Luckily, the fire, less than five miles north of Warm Springs, destroyed no structures,  but it did spark mass evacuations of dozens of homes nearby.

Ms Johnson is currently being held at the Columbia County Jail. She is due for sentencing on September 3.

In addition to having to pay back millions of dollars for the fire, she also faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Gabriel told NewsChannel 21 yesterday that the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Indian Affairs gave the case ‘top priority.’

The crime was investigated by both the BIA Special Wildland Arson Investigation Team and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Police Department.

Meanwhile, Aassistant U.S. Attorney Pamala Holsinger is handling prosecution of the case.
