A  castle which has hosted some of the world's most famous writers is up for grabs and could become Scotland's most expensive home at £5million.

Craigcrook Castle, which dates to the 16th century, Craigcrook Castle was known during the 19th century for its literary soirées and welcomed visitors as luminous as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Sir Walter Scott.

The lot in Blackhall, Edinburgh, was put on the market on Wednesday and is likely to break previous records for a residential property after it was set at just under £5million in 2007.

Craigcrook Castle, which dates to the 16th century, is up for sale for £5million and could become Scotland's most expensive home

Literary giants like Alfred Lord Tennyson, Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Sir Walter Scott have stayed here

Rory Ballantyne, of Ballantynes Estate Agents, which is marketing the property with Sothebys, said: 'Properties like this are very rare. We would expect to pass through that £5 million figure and beyond, by a significant margin.

'It is so enclosed and private that many don't know that it is there and that may attract celebrities and those who value their privacy.

'The lure is the possibility of owning a castle without having thousands of acres to upkeep.

'It really could be described almost as a lock-up-and-leave, and is therefore great for someone who has houses elsewhere.'

The literary link was established in the 19th century when Archibald Constable, the publisher, occupied it until 1815.

Afterwards it became the home of the lawyer and literary critic Francis Jeffrey. Sir Walter Scott visited the castle frequently under both tenancies.

Another 19th century tenant was the writer and politician William Stirling who, in 1855, offered the use of the grounds to the English poet Gerald Massey, then in Edinburgh as an editor on the Edinburgh News. Massey wrote the poem Craigcrook Castle while he was there.
