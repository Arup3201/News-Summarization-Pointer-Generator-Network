A couple 'taking a selfie' on the edge of a cliff died when they fell hundreds of feet while their young children watched.

The Polish couple died after falling from the rocky edge in Cabo da Raca, west Portugal.

Police say the pair, who are yet to be named, may have been trying to take a photo of themselves moments before they fell.

The children, aged five and six, saw their parents fall to their deaths 'while taking a selfie'

The cliffs at Cabo da Roca, where the pair fell, are known for their fantastic views of the Atlantic Ocean

The couple's children, aged five and six, witnessed the accident and are now undergoing psychiatric care.

The parents apparently crossed a safety barrier in order to reach the cliff edge, but the police are still investigating their final moments.

Captain Dario Pinto Moreira, who is in charge of the port at nearby Cascais, told Portuguese news channel CMTV that the Poles slipped.

Emergency services were alerted on Saturday evening by a Spanish couple, but attempts to recover the bodies were suspended until Sunday because of the rising tide.

Monika Dulian, Poland's consul in Lisbon, said the family had lived in Portugal for several years.

Relatives have been informed and are on their way to Portugal.

The couple are believed to have crossed a safety barrier before attempting to take a photo of themselves

Emergency services had to wait overnight for the tide to go out before recovering the two bodies

The couple would not be the first to die while taking a photograph of themselves.

Russian 17-year-old Xenia Ignatyeva plunged 30ft to her death as she climbed on a railway bridge to take a selfie.

She fell and was hit by 1,500 volts when she tried to grab live electrical wires.

Similarly, Italian teenager Isabella Fracchiolla fell 60ft on to jagged rocks while trying to take a selfie on a seafront in the town of Taranto, in south-eastern Italy.

The 16-year-old schoolgirl suffered serious injuries and could not be saved by doctors.
