The mother of a little boy who was upset about his new glasses asked some friends to help reassure him about his new look.

Lindsey Fisher began a Facebook account called Glasses for Noah, where bespectacled friends could send in pictures of themselves to reassure her son, Noah, about becoming a glasses-wearer.

Fisher reached out to friends and family, but the page took on a life of its own and strangers from around the country have sent in pictures for four-year-old Noah.
