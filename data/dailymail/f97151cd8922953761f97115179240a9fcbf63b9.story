NBC News' veteran chief medical correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman announced her departure Thursday, months after she sparked a controversy by violating a quarantine upon her return from covering the Ebola epidemic in Africa.

In a statement released this morning, Snyderman, 62, said that her decision to leave NBC was partially informed by her desire to return to her medical ‘roots.’

However, she noted that the Ebola scandal also played a role in her resignation.

Contrite: Snyderman, pictured working in Africa, returned to Today Show in December and apologized for violating the terms of her quarantine 

Rumor mill: On February 22, Snyderman appeared in a Nightly News segment about peanut allergies, in which she seemed disoriented and was tripping over her words.

'I stepped out of the OR a few years ago and it is now time for me to return to my roots, so I am stepping down from my position as Chief Medical Editor at NBC News.

‘Covering the Ebola epidemic last fall in Liberia, and then becoming part of the story upon my return to the U.S., contributed to my decision that now is the time to return to academic medicine,’ Snyderman stated.

‘I will be shortly taking up a faculty position at a major U.S. medical school. More needs to be done to communicate medicine and science to our viewers and citizens, especially in times of crisis, and with my experiences in the field and on air, that is going to be a priority for me.’

“I have loved my nine years at NBC and I am proud of the work my team has done. Very few people get the chance to combine two professions and I have appreciated the chance to inform the public about medical updates and the plight of so many in other countries. Every moment has been an honor.'

In conclusion of her parting note, Snyderman said she has loved her nine years at the network and was proud of the work her team has done informing the public about the plight of people around the world.

‘Every moment has been an honor,’ she summed it up.

NBC also released an anodyne statement Thursday commenting on Dr Snyderman’s abrupt departure from NBC News.

‘Throughout her career with NBC News, Dr. Nancy Snyderman has provided her expertise on countless health and medical topics that are vitally important to our audience,’ a spokesperson for the network wrote. ‘She’s been a valuable voice both on air and in our newsroom, and we wish her all the best.’

Nancy Snyderman had been reporting on the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC in October at the time a cameraman who briefly worked with her, Ashoka Mukpo, came down with the deadly virus.

Mukpo was transferred back to the U.S. for treatment at a Nebraska medical facility and has since recovered.

Snyderman and the rest of the NBC team were urged to voluntarily quarantine themselves for a 21-day period upon their return to the United States.

But during the midst of that quarantine, Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant, prompting New Jersey officials to make her quarantine mandatory.

Neither she nor anyone else from the network came down with Ebola.

Her takeout foray angered her bosses and unleashed a bitter response online, with some viewers saying that they would have a hard time trusting her again after the mistake in judgment.

NBC News President Deborah Turness told Dr Snyderman to take some time off.

In early December, after spending more than a month off air, Snyderman appeared on the Today Show to apologize profusely for her blunder.

Heir apparent: There is no word on who will replace Snyderman, but one possible contender could be NBC medical contributor Dr Roshini Raj, who presented a Today Show segment on Thursday

'I'm very sorry for not only scaring my community and the country but adding to the confusion of the terms that came as fast and furious as the news about Ebola did,' she told Matt Lauer.

'We had already been taking our temperatures... and we knew our risks in our heads... but we did not really appreciate and - frankly were not sensitive to - how absolutely scared Americans were.'

On February 22, Snyderman appeared in a Nightly News segment about peanut allergies, in which she seemed disoriented and was tripping over her words. 

Some NBC viewers quickly took to Twitter, wondering whether the veteran medical reporter was drunk on air.

Snyderman, a surgeon and former executive at Johnson & Johnson, has been at NBC News since 2006 after spending 17 years as a medical correspondent for ABC News.

There is no word at this time on who will replace Snyderman in the position of chief medical editor at NBC News, but there are a several possible candidates.

On Thursday, the day of Snyderman's announcement, NBC medical contributor Dr Roshini Raj appeared in a segment about a study that says there's a link between sleep deprivation and obesity.

Contender: Another possible contender for Snyderman's old job is Dr Natalie Azar, who came on the Today Show earlier this week to talk about hormone replacement therapy

Raj is a Harvard-educated gastroenterologist and internist with a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine.

She has ample media experience, having been a medical contributor at NBC News, Good Day New York, the day-time talk show Bethenny and Fox 5. She is also the medical editor of Health magazine.

Another possible contender for Snyderman's old job is Dr Natalie Azar, who came on the Today Show earlier this week to talk about hormone replacement therapy.

According to her biography, Azar is a Cornell Medical College graduate who specializes in rheumatology.

Dr Azar also has been a NBC News medical contributor and has made appearances on MSNBC, Fox News, Fox Business news and Fox 5 local news in New York.
