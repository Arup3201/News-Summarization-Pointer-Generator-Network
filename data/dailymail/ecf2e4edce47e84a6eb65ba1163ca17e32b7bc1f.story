We've seen him riding a camel across a desert in Arab robes, impersonating Elvis Presley in Las Vegas, and even posing naked - all in the name of promoting his Virgin brand.

It seems there are no lengths Sir Richard Branson won't go to to generate publicity, with the 62-year-old dressing up as a Maharaja and surrounding himself with a bevy of Indian beauties in Mumbai for his latest wacky PR stunt.

Never afraid to make a fool of himself for the cameras, the billionaire performed a traditional dance, banged a drum and waved the Indian flag, all to mark the relaunch of Virgin Atlantic flights from London to Mumbai, India.

Virgin is resurrecting its London to
Mumbai flights after dropping the route in 2009 due to falling demand 
in the wake of terror attacks on three hotels in the city.

Three
years on the number of foreigners visiting India is rising, increasing 
by almost 25 per cent to 6.29 million between 2009 and 2011, while the 
number of Indians taking trips abroad has risen to 14.2 million.

The
airline is hoping to capitalise on demand from inter-continental 
transfer passengers by timing its relaunched service to depart or arrive
at Heathrow within two hours of flights from U.S. cities including New 
York and Washington, according to a report in The Washington Post.

'As
you grow, you get to a stage where you can’t just fill your planes on 
point-to-point passengers, you need some connecting passengers,' said 
Virgin Atlantic CEO Steve Ridgway.

Earlier this month Branson's Virgin group was gifted a PR victory after the Department for Transport was forced to ask him to keep running trains on the West Coast main line.

It came after Virgin Trains lost the lucrative contract to run Britain's busiest rail line in August.

Virgin was due to hand over the line to rival First Group on December 9 but ‘significant technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed this month, which saw three civil servants suspended and the deal torn up.

The fiasco saw ministers pleading with Virgin Trains to remain in control of the line for between nine and 13 months while the government decides who will operate the franchise on a more permanent basis.
