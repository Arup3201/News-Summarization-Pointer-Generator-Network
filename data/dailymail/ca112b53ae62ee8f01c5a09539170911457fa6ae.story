Four women have been indecently assaulted in less than two hours and police believe the same man was responsible.

The series of incidents, where the women were either grabbed or the man exposed himself to them, unfolded in Melbourne's north west on the first of November.

The first case occurred when a 46 year old woman was running on the Tan track on Birdwood avenue at around 6am when she was approached from behind by an unknown man.

Police say he grabbed the woman before fleeing towards St Kilda road.
