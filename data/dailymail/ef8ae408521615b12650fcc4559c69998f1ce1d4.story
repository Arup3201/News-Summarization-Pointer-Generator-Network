John Terry might be taking instructions from Jose Mourinho during Chelsea's pre-season training camp in Austria, but he'll also have the words of another Premier League manager for company.

The Blues skipper revealed that he is taking Harry Redknapp's autobiography Always Managing on the club's trip after sharing an Instagram picture of what he'd be packing for the flight.

QPR boss Redknapp, who guided Chelsea's west London neighbours back to the Premier League via the play-offs last season, released his latest book in October last year.

VIDEO New teams won't break into top seven - Redknapp

1. NutriBullet food processor (£99)

2. Harry Redknapp autobiography (£20)

3. Personalised diary

4. iPad Mini, 64GB (£429)

5. MacBook Air laptop (£999)

6. Bang & Olufsen BeoPlay H6 headphones (£329)

7. Personalised washbag

The hardback, which looks back on the highs and lows of Redknapp's career, is sure to be of interest to Terry as he is mentioned on three separate occasions.

In his book, Redknapp claims that he received a text message of support from Terry when the England job became available in 2012.

He also says that he understood Fabio Capello's decision to step down from the role after Terry was removed as captain and that the Chelsea man, along with fellow senior players Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole, is not the type of player to avoid representing his country.

The views of the former Tottenham and West Ham boss are sure to keep Terry entertained during Chelsea's intense pre-season, which sees them play five games across Austria, Holland, Slovenia and Germany.

As well as
 Redknapp's book, the former England captain also showed off the gadgets
 which will accompany him over the next fortnight.

Terry
 packed a MacBook Air, an iPad Mini and a large pair of Bang and Olufsen
 BeoPlay H6 headphones to help fight the occasional boredom during Chelsea's European tour.

Whether
 it's chatting to his family on Skype or listening to his favourite 
tunes using his top-of-the-range audio equipment, the veteran defender 
is certain to be well connected while he's away.

He
 also made sure not to forget the essentials, packing his passport, 
customary washbag and a personalised diary, which may well hold the secrets to his food and fitness regime.

The 33-year-old has been in superb form during pre-season so far, netting three goals in two games, including the winner in a 3-2 victory against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.

And he seemed to put some of that early success down to his summer diet, adding the message: 'Packing my bag to fly to Austria this morning. Thanks to NUTRIBULLET, Loving the healthy shakes for pre season.'

Terry will continue knocking back fruit and vegetable smoothies abroad after packing a NutriBullet food processor, instruction guide and what appears to be a bag of almonds.

Mourinho will be hoping his captain's good form continues when Chelsea begin their hunt for the title away at newly-promoted Burnley on August 18.
