One diver experienced a real life trout pout after puckering up for a smacker with a fishy friend.

Photographer Cesare Naldi, 36, from Napoli, Italy, captured the moment a grouper fish popped its head out of a hole and landed an underwater kiss on diver Maurilio Mirabella's lips.

The tender moment happened when Maurilio was diving in the waters of Roatan, Honduras, and decided to make friends.

Pucker up: Maurillo Mirabella shares a tender moment with a grouper fish while diving near Honduras

Photographer Cesare Naldi, 36, captured the moment the grouper fish swam from its hiding place among some rocks and moved in for a kiss

The fish popped out of its hole and let Maurilio embrace it and even have a kiss.

Photographer Cesare said: 'To take these pictures I used standard scuba diving equipment, but the guide that came with us had extra equipment for cave diving including double oxygen tank and lights.

Grouper fish are often a favourite find of snap-happy scuba divers, due to their impressive size and the fact that they are largely unafraid of humans

'I couldn't believe I managed to shoot such unique pictures. The fish was very friendly with the diver and even let him hug and kiss on the lips which was amazing to watch.'

The Nassau grouper fish, which live in warm waters around the world including in Honduras, Florida, Brazil, Panama and Columbia, can grow up to 4ft long and weigh as much as 55lb.

They are often found hiding in shipwrecks and reefs, preferring to stay hidden in cracks and crevices. They are carnivorous, eating smaller fish and other small crustaceans.

Grouper were once common, congregating in groups thousands strong around spawning time in December and January, usually to coincide with a full moon.

However, thanks to their large size and peaceful demeanor, numbers dwindled as they were hunted for food and for sport - as their impressive bulk makes for a good trophy.

Habitat destruction has also helped cause this decline, as the fish need large reef systems to hunt and breed in.

They are now listed as endangered and have protected status in the U.S., though as stocks have recovered in recent years, officials are now considering removing this protection.
