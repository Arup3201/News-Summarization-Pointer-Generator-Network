Louis van Gaal has challenged £43million misfit Radamel Falcao to prove himself — and took a swipe at the on-loan striker’s agent in the process.

The Manchester United manager also claimed there will not be a January purchase to boost his side’s chances of Champions League qualification.

Falcao, 28, has struggled for fitness and form since his deadline-day switch from Monaco, scoring just three times in 13 appearances.

604 - Minutes played for United so far

3 - Goals scored and three assists in all competitions

201.3 - Minutes per goal. Papiss Cisse leads the league on 70.33

£40,000 - Falcao’s daily wages

£1.77m - Cost of each of his United goals in wages, not including bonuses (Each of Alexis Sanchez’s 18 goals has cost Arsenal £210,000 in wages)

Van Gaal dropped him ahead of their home defeat to Southampton last weekend — Falcao did not even make the bench — a move that prompted agent Jorge Mendes to claim his client would walk into any other team in the world.

But Van Gaal responded: ‘He has to prove himself. We have made a deal and everything is clear. It’s not the end of the year so he has a chance.’

United have a clause in the £6m season-long deal that would allow them to sign Falcao for a reported £43m, but Van Gaal said that when it came to making the squad the player’s value counted for nothing.

‘If a player cost £95m or £5,000 it’s not any different for me,’ Van Gaal said. ‘You have to prove yourself.’

Van Gaal declined to comment on how Falcao, who is earning about £265,000 a week, had handled his omission but the striker travelled to London with the squad yesterday for the Barclays Premier League clash with QPR today. 

Louis van Gaal refused to answer questions about whether Falcao and Van Persie would start at QPR

‘That is not for you or the media,’ he said. ‘It is between the player and the manager. I’m sorry.’ 

When asked if Mendes’ outburst was unhelpful, Van Gaal said. ‘Of course, but it does not interest me’. 

Van Gaal, who spent £156m in the summer, has been linked with two full backs, Seamus Coleman of Everton and Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne. But he insisted he was not expecting to spend big.

‘I don’t think we shall be very active,’ he said. ‘Not many players at a certain level are available.

‘I have also said when we have to buy a player he has to be better than our players who are playing now and that is a difficult job.’

Former United midfielder Paul Scholes has criticised Van Gaal’s preference for a 3-5-2 system, claiming it means possession but creates few chances.

Despite his side not having one shot on target against Southampton, Van Gaal disagreed and pointed to his side’s draw at Tottenham as proof it could work.

‘You pick up a match like that but I can pick up a match like Tottenham Hotspur away,’ he said.

‘A top-six club, and we played fantastic, were creative and could have scored a lot of goals.’

Robin van Persie is United’s only injury worry against QPR but he should be fit to play.

The 31-year-old’s contract expires at the end of next season but Van Gaal refused to reveal whether a new deal was in the pipeline.
