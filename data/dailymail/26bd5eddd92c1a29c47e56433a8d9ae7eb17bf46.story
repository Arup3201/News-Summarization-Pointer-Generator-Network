It appears that Conan O'Brien was able to pull off one of the greatest celebrity pranks of all time yet never shared the details of his awesome feat - until now. 

The popular talk show host revealed that while attending Harvard University in the 1980s he managed to convince Bill Cosby that he had received a lifetime achievement award from the prestigious Ivy league institution.

What's more, Cosby then flew to Harvard and showed up in a tuxedo, at which point O'Brien presented him with an old bowling trophy.

O'Brien was a student at the time and worked at the Harvard Lampoon when he told Cosby he won the Lifetime Achievement in Comedy award, which he showed up to accept in a tuxedo (above)

O'Brien shared this story as he appeared on The Howard Stern Show.

'I honestly wanted to meet him,' explained O'Brien. 

'I think it came from a good place.'

Making the entire experience even more hysterical is that Cosby arrived at the airport in a private plane already wearing his tuxedo, and O'Brien picked him up in his parents' dirty station wagon.

'He walks out, and I’m like, "Mr. Cosby! Hey!"' O’Brien told the popular radio host.

'And he’s looking past me for the stretch limo — and there’s no stretch limo. So I opened the door and went, "'It’s in here, c’mon!"'

O'Brien then said at one point Cosby even held up the wrapper of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

Then, Cosby arrived at the school where he accepted what he believed to be the Lifetime Achievement in Comedy award, presented by the popular Harvard Lampoon, looking thrilled to be there.

'He comes out, and that’s when I saw what a master he is,' said O'Brien. 

'I saw this guy not really do material, he just went out. But in that Bill Cosby way, he’s got the rhythm.' 

This as women continue to come forward claiming they were raped and sexually assaulted by Cosby over the years.

Despite all of this though, Cosby told fans in a recent letter after being forced to cancel numerous shows over the uproar; 'I'm far from finished.'

He also said in the letter, which thanked the Heymann Performing Arts Center for not cancelling his show set for Friday; 'I can't wait to see your smiling faces and warm your hearts with a wonderful gift – LAUGHTER.'

Dear Fans: 

For 53 years you have given me your love, support, respect and trust. Thank you! I can't wait to see your smiling faces and warm your hearts with a wonderful gift – LAUGHTER. I'm ready! I thank you, the theatre staff (Heymann Performing Arts Center), the event organizers and the Lafayette community for your continued support and coming to experience family, fun entertainment. Hey, hey, hey – I'm far from finished
