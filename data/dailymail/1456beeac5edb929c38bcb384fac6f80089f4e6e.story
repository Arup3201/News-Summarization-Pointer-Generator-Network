Security researchers say that the hi-tech 'worm' has stolen 45,000 Facebook log-ins and passwords - and that the cyber-criminals behind it may be using these to infect others, or even penetrate email accounts

A hi-tech cyber attack has stolen 45,000 user names and passwords from Facebook - mostly from customers in the UK.

Researchers fear that the criminals - using the Ramnit worm, an attack often used to steal banking details and attack corporate networks - may be using these 'infected' accounts to send links to people's Facebook friends, spreading the computer 'worm' further.

Clicking on links can direct Facebook users to infected websites, which download the worm into their PCs, turning them into another victim.

They also say that the passwords for the 45,000 accounts could be used by the cybercriminals to break into email services.

Anyone who uses the same password across several web services is at risk.

Seculert estimates that 69 per cent of infected computers are in the UK.

'Worm' is a technical term for malicious software made by hackers which can spread itself without human help - making worms potentially more dangerous than viruses, which only spread through innocent-looking but infected files.

Security company Seculert, which tracked the attack, says, 'Seculert has discovered 
that Ramnit recently started targeting Facebook accounts with 
considerable success, stealing over 45,000 Facebook login credentials 
worldwide, mostly from people in the UK and France.'

'We suspect that the attackers behind 
Ramnit are using the stolen credentials to log in to victims' Facebook 
accounts and to transmit malicious links to their friends, thereby 
helping it spread even further. I

'Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the fact that users tend to use 
the same password in various web-based services -Facebook, Gmail, Microsoft Outlook - to gain remote access to 
corporate networks.'

Ramnit is a hi-tech cyber attack which infects a computer in several different ways, designed to steal passwords and sensitive information.

Ramnit is estimated to account for 17.3 per cent of new computer infections worldwide, according to security experts Symantec.

Between September and December last year, 800,000 machines worldwide were infected with Ramnit, say the researchers.

The recent infection was tracked by security company Seculert, who tracked the 'command and control' servers used to send commands to remote-control computers infected with Ramnit.

Computers infected with malicious software often 'wait' for commands from the hackers who have infected them.

In the case of Ramnit, the server that sends the commands is well known, 'Since the Ramnit Facebook command-and-control site is
visible and accessible it was fairly straightforward to detect that 
over 45,000 Facebook login credentials have been stolen worldwide, 
mostly from users in the United Kingdom and France.'
