Dawn Barry was loved on Come Dine With Me for her eccentric personality - but behind her bubbly image, she hid a sadness that led this week to her suicide.

For over a decade, she had been seeking celebrity stardom on a string of reality television shows.

After appearing on Blind Date and Club Reps the glamorous salon owner from Lancashire finally shot to fame as a contestant on the TV cookery programme in January 2009.

Miss Barry, 38, was named on fan sites as the Channel 4 show's ‘best ever contestant’, causing endless amusement after becoming raucous and then suddenly falling asleep.

She drew gasps from viewers when she became tipsy on her own competition night and went to bed - leaving one of the other contestants to cook her meal.

Popular: Miss Barry was a fan favourite thanks to her bubbly personality and unusual behaviour

During the week-long show, Miss Barry collapse at the table with her hair falling into a dish filled with avocado dip, and another night she left a dinner party unannounced after she felt sleepy.

The sudden bouts of sleepiness caused some viewers to debate whether she was suffering from narcolepsy.

But the beautician had in fact been dealing with alcohol and mental health problems for a number of years and had spent time in rehab.

And in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Miss Barry apparently killed herself after a long battle with alcoholism and depression.

Friends paid tribute to Miss Barry, describing her as ‘talented’ and the ‘life and soul of a party’.

Lindsay McCann, 27, who worked with Miss Barry for six years, said: ‘She was a very bubbly person and incredibly loveable.

‘She had a wonderful character and she enjoyed making people laugh and I have so many good memories of her.

‘We have been so shocked by what has happened but she had been poorly for some time. Yesterday was a dreadful day.’

Miss Barry, who owned the Naughty Nails Salon in Preston, was so ill that she had stopped working at the beginning of the year.

As a result, last week her father Raymond sold her beauty business to her long-standing friend and colleague, Samantha Eastham.

Miss Eastham, 30, said: ‘I had known Dawn for 12 years and it was fantastic working with her.

‘Everything about her stood out because she had such a big personality and she would really make you laugh. In her heyday she was a brilliant businesswoman who travelled the world and was incredibly successful.

‘She had been poorly since the beginning of the year and she had not really been herself for a long time. It has been very upsetting and sad and we will all miss her.’

Meanwhile, her friends also took to social networking site Facebook to pay their respects. Anna Holden wrote: ‘Goodnight and godbless - Lots of love - don’t terrorise the old people up there!’

Another friend, Delicia Mick Day, said: 'RIP Dawn, thoughts with the family.’

In April 2009, Miss Barry hit the headlines after she was convicted of drink-driving. She was three and a half times over the drink drive limit when she ploughed her Audi into two parked cars outside a nursery yards from her home.

She was handed an eight-week suspended prison sentence and banned from driving for five years. She also had a previous drink-driving conviction dating back to 2000.

At the time her solicitor Barry David Scully said she was suffering from alcohol and mental health problems and her family were ‘concerned for her emotional well-being.’

In June 2011, her former partner Carl Anthony Britton, 40, was spared jail for domestic abuse. A court heard he hit Miss Barry in the face during a drinking session, gashing her forehead.

A police spokesman confirmed that Miss Barry had been taken to the Royal Preston Hospital at around 5am on October 1 and died later the same day. Her death is not being treated as suspicious.
