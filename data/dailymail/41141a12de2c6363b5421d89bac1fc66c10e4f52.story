A witness testified at Drew Peterson's murder trial today that the former Illinois police officer offered him $25,000 to hire a hit man to kill his third wife just three months before she was found dead.

Prosecutors allege that Peterson, 58, killed Kathleen Savio himself because he feared a settlement after their divorce would ruin him, but they presented the hit-man testimony in a bid to establish that he had thought seriously about her murder in advance.

Jeff Pachter told the jury that Peterson asked him to locate a hit man during a late night ride in his squad car in the Chicago suburb.

Savio was found dead in a bathtub in her suburban Chicago home with a gash on the back of her head in March 2004, just three months later.

'He asked if I could find someone to take care of his third wife,' said Pachter, who worked with the Bolingbrook police sergeant when he was moonlighting at a cable company.

'He indicated that he would give me the $25,000 and if I could find someone to do it for less I could keep the remaining balance.'

The two agreed on a code word that he would use to let Peterson know when the deed was done. Pachter said he couldn't remember the exact word but that it had something to do with cookies.

Prosecutors, who say they could rest within several days, have no physical evidence, so they are trying to build a circumstantial case that leads jurors to conclude Peterson must have killed Savio.

Her death was initially ruled an accident but was reclassified a homicide after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007.

Peterson is a suspect in Stacy Peterson's disappearance but hasn't been charged in her case.

Peterson hunched forward in his Joliet courtroom seat and appeared to listen intently to Pachter, 38, who spoke in a firm, monotone voice.

Pachter said the officer also told him to let him know when the hit was scheduled so he could arrange a plausible alibi.

It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the 
bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a 
homicide

One idea Peterson mentioned was starting a fight at an amusement park on the day so there would be a record he was there.

And he told the jury Peterson warned him to keep the plan quiet.

'He told me at the end of the ride along that, "This is something you will take to your grave",' Pachter said.

During cross-examination, defense 
attorney Joe Lopez pressed Pachter on his criminal record, which 
includes a conviction for sexual abuse, and accused him of inventing his
story for personal profit.

'It's hard to remember things when 
you are making them up, isn't it?' Lopez asked when Pachter said he 
couldn't recall details of an earlier statement. 'You want your 15 
minutes of fame, don't you?'

Pachter shot back: 'No, I do not.'

Pachter conceded he had a hard time 
telling if Peterson was serious about the request, describing him as 
prone to kidding around and that he was always calm no matter the 
situation.

Forensic pathologist Larry Blum told jurors he didn't believe a single, fatal slip could explain how Savio had a fresh gash on the back of her head

And, he said, he took no steps to act on the request.

Pachter hadn't heard that Savio was 
dead when he called Peterson in July 2004 to ask how his newest wife, 
Stacy, and their kids were doing.

'He said his family was doing good,' 
said Pachter. 'After that, he said, 'The favor that I asked you — I 
don't need it anymore.''

Prosecutors' only witness yesterday 
was pathologist Mary Case, who testified that a two-inch gash on the 
back of Savio's head could not have caused her to pass out.

That counters defense suggestions that Savio slipped in her bathtub, hit her head, lost consciousness and drowned.

As Case spoke, prosecutors projected 
autopsy photos of Savio's head with the top half of her skull cut away 
and some jurors shifted uncomfortably in their seats.

The wound penetrated the thick layer of skin around the skull, Case told jurors, but caused no damage to the brain.

'There was no brain trauma ... no internal brain injury that would have caused a loss of consciousness,' Case said.

Case is one of several forensic experts to testify as prosecutors seek to prove that Savio was murdered. She 
said Savio would have had to fall hard three separate times to account 
for deep bruises on the front of her body and the injury to the back of 
her head.

But the judge upheld a defense objection about that comment and told jurors to disregard it.

Last week, another pathologist  testified last week, saying he 
didn't believe a single, fatal slip could explain how Savio had a fresh 
gash on the back of her head and a pattern of deep bruises on the front 
of her bod

‘I couldn't see how that could happen,’ Dr Larry Blum testified.

Blum, a key witness for the state, was subject to aggressive questioning by the defense later in the day.

Over the objections of prosecutors, 
the judge let defense attorney Ralph Meczyk ask if three other 
pathologists who reviewed autopsy data still held Savio died 
accidentally.

‘Despite their opinion, you say homicide?’ the attorney asked. 'I haven't changed my opinion,’ Blum responded.

Blum
also denied Meczyk's suggestion that he manipulated his autopsy results
to mesh with Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow's theory that 
Savio was murdered.

Blum
testified earlier that Savio's circular tub also had no edges 
pronounced enough to cause the two-inch, straight-line wound on her 
head.

Also,
the position of Savio's body in the tub - face down and with her feet 
jammed against the sides of the tub - did not support a theory that she 
slipped and hit the back of her head, he said.

Peterson,
a 58-year-old former suburban Chicago police officer, has pleaded not 
guilty to first-degree murder in Savio's death. He is also a suspect in 
Stacy Peterson's disappearance, although he has never been charged in 
her case. Authorities presume she is dead, though a body has never been 
found.
