‘If I hadn’t fallen pregnant the brain tumours would have carried on growing,' said Mel Hennessy

Recovering in hospital the day after giving birth to her daughter, Mel Hennessy was suddenly crippled by an excruciating headache.

‘I’ve never known pain like it,’ says the 43-year-old former beauty therapy tutor from Redcar, North Yorkshire.

‘It was in my eyeballs and eye sockets. 

'I couldn’t stop trembling — I couldn’t even hold my baby, Daisy.’

At first, Mel put her symptoms down to side-effects from the Caesarean anaesthetic. 

But four days after the birth, in September 2009, the left side of her face was paralysed, too.

Mel’s GP diagnosed Bell’s palsy, where the facial nerve becomes inflamed after a viral infection, and prescribed steroids. 

Two weeks later, the paralysis had gone, but the pain had returned.

‘I had toothache, headaches, eye ache,’ says Mel, who is married to Wayne, 45, a pipe fitter. 

‘I was exhausted and could barely look after Daisy. Then I began losing the sight in my left eye.’

Mel was referred for CT scans, which revealed two brain tumours — one so huge it stretched from behind her left ear to the bottom of her jaw and then down her spine.

‘A hospital oncologist later said it was like an octopus wrapped around everything — it was the largest brain tumour he’d seen,’ says Mel.

The second tumour was smaller and on the right-hand side of her face.

Doctors believe the tumours had been there for ten years and hormones produced during Mel’s pregnancy with Daisy had caused them to grow aggressively, pressing on nerves that resulted in her symptoms.

‘If I hadn’t fallen pregnant the brain tumours would have carried on growing, but much more slowly until it was too late,’ says Mel. ‘Daisy saved my life.’

Mel is one of the 14,000 Britons diagnosed with brain tumours every year. 

The recent case of Ashya King, the five-year-old whose parents were arrested in Spain after removing him from Southampton General Hospital, has thrown a spotlight on this Cinderella cancer.

The Kings wanted their son to undergo proton beam therapy, a more sophisticated form of radiotherapy. 

However, the NHS will not always fund the treatment for brain tumours and even if it does, patients have to travel overseas to get it.

Nine people die from brain tumours every day in England and Wales — they are the biggest cancer killer of children and under-40s in Britain. Yet brain tumours receive 1 per cent of the money spent on cancer research.

A report from Cancer Research UK found that while half of patients diagnosed with all types of cancer survive for at least ten years, this drops to 13 per cent for brain tumour patients.

Indeed, survival rates for brain cancer increased by only 7 per cent between 1970 and 2014, while the majority of other cancer survival rates soared.

Part of the problem is that it can take months, even years, to be diagnosed because many GPs are poorly informed about brain cancer, says Sue Farrington Smith, chief executive of the charity Brain Tumour Research.

‘The speed and quality of brain tumour diagnosis is patchy across the country. This is a reflection of the lack of investment and awareness about this disease.

‘Diagnosis is often delayed because GPs and A&E teams may not request scans early enough or scans showing abnormalities may not be referred promptly to a specialist neuroscience team.’

'I couldn’t stop trembling — I couldn’t even hold my baby, Daisy,' said Mel

And many symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, vomiting and difficulty in walking, can be attributed to other causes, such as migraines or stress.

Furthermore, as there are more than 120 different types of brain tumours, their location and behaviour mean symptoms can vary, as can treatment.

The number of sufferers may be nearly three times as high as the statistics indicate, says Geoff Pilkington, who leads the Brain Tumour Research flagship centre at the University of Portsmouth.

‘Until recently, statistics included only those with primary brain tumours — those originating in the tissue of the brain. 

'However, there are other types of brain tumour.’

These include secondary cancers from other parts of the body spreading to the brain, tumours growing on the brain membrane and those growing on the cranial nerve. 

‘If these are taken into account, 14,000 cases a year becomes more like 40,000.’

And unusually, compared with other cancers, cases are increasing. In 2012, there were 23 per cent more men diagnosed as suffering from brain tumours than in 1970 and 25 per cent more women.

One explanation is better diagnosis, thanks to increased awareness and improved diagnostic tools, says Professor Pilkington.

Lifestyle factors — such as mobile phone use, chemicals and exposure to radiation — could be contributing factors.

The largest number of brain tumours in adults are due to secondary cancers spreading to the brain via the bloodstream — particularly from breast, lung and skin cancers (the structure of these cancer cells enables them to stick to the blood vessels in the brain in a way other cancer cells do not).

‘I had to learn to walk again and it affected my speech. My husband Wayne had to wash and feed me. In the end, things were so bad I had to live with my mother-in-law for four months,' said Mel  

Between 20 and 40 per cent of all cancers spread to the brain, says Kevin O’Neill, consultant neurosurgeon at Imperial College Healthcare Trust. 

Treatment options include surgery (location and tumour type permitting), radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Proton beam therapy is a more targeted form of radiotherapy and is thought to be less harmful to healthy brain tissue, though some experts question this.

Meanwhile, some chemotherapy drugs are ‘no use’ in brain tumours ‘because the blood/brain barrier that prevents toxins reaching the brain stops some drugs getting through,’ says Dr O’Neill.

Blood vessels are more tightly packed together in the brain, and are bound by proteins and special cells, meaning only fat-soluble substances (most chemotherapy drugs are water-soluble) get through.

Thanks to fundraising and sponsorship, £20 million is to be invested in new centres for brain cancer research: two in London — at Queen Mary University and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust — and one in Plymouth. Seven centres are planned.

‘I still get a lot of pain in my head, eyes and teeth,’ said Mel

Mel’s tumours were found to be a meningioma, a relatively common tumour originating in the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain. It can usually be removed with surgery as it rarely penetrates brain tissue.

However, the largest tumour had grown aggressively, fuelled by pregnancy hormones. 

Its size and the fact it had grown around delicate brain structures and important blood vessels made it difficult to fully remove without risking brain injury or paralysis.

In March 2010, Mel underwent surgery to remove 30 per cent of the largest tumour — the part surrounding her left eye — followed by radiotherapy.

‘I was told there was a chance I wouldn’t survive surgery or I’d be paralysed afterwards,’ says Mel. Fortunately, she was unscathed.

However, she says: ‘I went through hell.’

‘I had to learn to walk again and it affected my speech. My husband Wayne had to wash and feed me. 

'In the end, things were so bad I had to live with my mother-in-law for four months, so she could look after me and the baby as Wayne had to work.’

The sight in her left eye could not be saved, because the tumour had damaged the optic nerve.

‘I still get a lot of pain in my head, eyes and teeth,’ says Mel, who has MRI scans every eight months and is too exhausted to return to work.

‘I’m weak and need to sleep several hours a day. I need a childminder to help look after Daisy.’

The tumours have stopped growing (the smaller one did not require surgery), but she may need another operation if that changes.

‘Despite it all, I’m hugely positive — and you never know what scientific breakthroughs may be around the corner.’
