She arrived in a flurry of cream silk and tipped a wink to the royals as her car pulled up on Horse Guards Parade.

Today, Angélica Rivera was back in a cream ensemble as she said her farewells to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace this morning.

The moment came at the end of the three-day state visit from Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto and his glamorous wife, with the couple set to spend the afternoon in Aberdeen before flying home tonight.

On their way: The Queen emerges from Buckingham Palace with President Enrique Peña Nieto

President Peña Nieto, 48, and Ms Rivera, 45, began the visit with a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade.

There, they were treated to a 42-gun Royal Salute and a traditional procession along the Mall, with the Queen travelling with President Peña Nieto in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach.

Behind them came the Duke of Edinburgh and Ms Rivera who chatted happily as they waved at the crowds from their seats in the Australian State Coach. 

Ms Rivera, a former soap star, was then squired on a tour of the Royal Collection by a clearly charmed Duke of Edinburgh, with the pair seen deep in conversation as they inspected a saddle presented to Prince Philip during a visit to Mexico in 1975.

Later, she drew all eyes as she arrived for the traditional State Dinner in a spectacular crimson dress that made her look almost as regal as the Queen herself.

Ms Rivera's whirlwind tour also included a solo visit to the set of Downton Abbey alongside the Countess of Wessex yesterday, and a dinner at London's Guildhall.

Meanwhile, her husband spent much of yesterday locked in talks, with Nick Clegg visiting the president at Buckingham Palace in the morning and Ed Miliband following in the afternoon.

In between meetings, President Peña Nieto travelled to Downing Street for a meeting with the Prime Minister, during which the issue of human rights was raised.

But the Mexican leader was back at his wife's side for last night's dinner at the London Guildhall, where they were joined by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and his wife Birgitte.

On arrival, the couple were welcomed with a  Royal Salute fired from the cannons at the Tower of London during which a total of 62 shots were fired - the basic 21-gun Royal Salute, plus another 20 because the Tower is a royal palace and a further 21 for the City of London.

The Mexican National Anthem was then played and President Peña Nieto was invited to inspect a Guard of Honour before making his way inside.

At the end of the banquet, both President Peña Nieto and Lord Mayor Yarrow made speeches - in President Peña Nieto's case, for the second night in a row.

The Mexican couple, who are currently in Aberdeen meeting with the Secretary of State for Scotland, Alastair Carmichael MP, will spend the afternoon touring the Robert Gordon University.

During the visit, they will be introduced to academics and be shown a demonstration of the Drilling and Advanced Rig Training simulator.

This evening, they will be formally bid farewell by Viscount Brookeborough, Lord-in-Waiting to the Queen before boarding a flight back to Mexico.
