Andy Murray was almost late for his appointment at the Palace to collect his OBE.

Just minutes before the Wimbledon champion was due to leave his Surrey home for the trip to London yesterday, he had a knock on the door.

It was the doping squad asking him to take a random drug test and was, he ruefully admitted, not the best of timing.

Panic: The tennis star posted on Twitter suggesting he may not be at Buckingham Palace in time

Award: Wimbledon champion Andy Murray smiles as he receives his OBE medal from the Duke of Cambridge

Proud pet: Murray shared a picture of his dog 'Maggie May' wearing his OBE on Twitter

He tweeted at the time: ‘I’m in the 
middle of a drug test hahaha I’m goin [sic] to be late!!!’

But
the tennis star managed to arrive on time, turning up in a 
chauffeur-driven people carrier and posing for photographers with his 
girlfriend Kim Sears and parents Judy and William before the ceremony.

He said testers turned up at his door at 8.20am when he had booked a taxi for half past eight.

'I was a bit worried I was going to be late but the taxi did a great job in getting us here.'

'It's part of the job but when you have a day like today you are looking forward to, it's the last thing you need.'

Later in the day Murray went on Twitter again, posting a photo of his dog Maggie May wearing the medal around her neck.

When he went to pick up his award, the two-time Grand Slam winner teased The Duke of Cambridge  
about a good luck note he had sent him before the Wimbledon finals.

After the player's name was called - 'Mr 
Andrew Murray For Services to Tennis' - William smiled and talked to 
Murray for more than a minute, discussing his recent back surgery and a letter
the Duchess of Cambridge had sent him.

The former US Open champion said he was surprised they had spoken for so long as he was told the handover would only take around 15 seconds.

'He asked me about my recent back surgery which I had a few weeks ago and how I was feeling after Wimbledon.

'I teased him a bit as he had sent me a note to me before Wimbledon wishing me luck and his wife had written me a letter afterwards.

'Her handwriting was beautiful and I told him how fantastic it was compared to his.

'I have met him a few times before and he has always been very easy going. He seemed very relaxed today.'

Chat: The Duke of Cambridge spoke to the tennis star for longer than any other of the award winners

Support: The Wimbledon champion was also joined by his parents Judy and William

Emotional: Andy's mother Judy took to Twitter to demonstrate the pride she felt for her son

Murray's mother, Judy, also took to the social network site during the day, posting a photo of her son on the steps of Buckingham Palace after the ceremony, saying: 'Yes I cried.'

In what is sure to be the first  
ceremony of a long royal career, William also presented awards to 
recipients from across the UK, including an 
OBE to Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman and an MBE to singer and 
presenter Aled
Jones. 

Sir Kenneth Gibson was the first person 
to be knighted by the prince for his services to education.

There were no decorations (i.e. medals or Garter sash) as is usual practice for Investitures.The
prince was permitted to wear his RAF Uniform as, although he has left 
operational service, he officially remains in the force until January 
2014.

The Duke has 
recently given up operational duties with the RAF after serving three 
years as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot in North Wales.

He is now in a 'transitional' year, sources have said, and is considering options for his public service.

But
with his grandmother the Queen and grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh 
advancing in years, there is speculation that William may take on extra 
responsibilities.

William 
arrived in the gilt and scarlet palace ballroom attended by two Gurkha 
Orderly Officers, a tradition begun in 1876 by Queen Victoria.

On
duty were five members of The Queen's Body Guard of the Yeomen of the 
Guard, which was created in 1485 by King Henry V11 after his victory at 
the Battle of Bosworth Field - making them both the oldest royal 
bodyguard and also the oldest military corps existing in the UK.

William
waited for the name of each recipient to be announced before taking the
decoration from a velvet cushion and pinning them onto the recipient's 
lapel.

Services to the restaurant industry: Jill Stein, who co-owns The Seafood Restaurant with TV Chef Rick Stein, was also given an OBE

After investing his 
first award, making Professor Dame Nicola Cullum a Dame Commander for 
services to Nursing Research and Wound Care, he smiled and appeared to 
breath a slight sigh of relief.

Two
of the recipients were made knights, kneeling on a velvet investiture 
stool in front of the prince as he wielded his late great-grandfather 
King George VI's sword.

William
appeared cautious but had clearly been practising hard as he tapped the
men in turn on each shoulder before placing their honour around their 
necks.

Duties: The Queen was also at the Palace today, where she met Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan Vaughn Schofield

Sir Kenneth, who has worked in education for 35 years and is currently executive head of several 'challenging' schools in the north east of England, described William as a 'complete natural'.

'He seemed very relaxed, far more so than myself. I found it all very overwhelming and was very nervous but he took it in his stride,' he said.

'I told him that it was a huge privilege to be the first person to be knighted by him and he acknowledged it with a smile.

'I know there was some speculation in the press about him practising so that he didn't chop anyone's ear off but he was absolutely fine.'

As the hour-long 
ceremony unfolded an orchestra drawn from the Bands of the Household 
Division played tunes including Scarborough Fair by Faure and Salute to 
Handel.

Murray was awarded 
the OBE in the New Year Honours, before his historic triumph at 
Wimbledon, after winning the US Open and men's tennis final at London 
2012.

He beat Novak Djokovic to become the first British man in 77 years to win the singles title at Wimbledon.

TV host Jones was also recognised with an MBE for services to music, broadcasting and charity.

The
former teenage choirboy, who now fronts morning show Daybreak, found 
fame at the age of 12 with his top five hit Walking In The Air, which 
was written for the animated movie The Snowman.

Another
recipient, Jon Plowman, served as the BBC's head of comedy for 10 
years, producing classics such as Absolutely Fabulous, French And 
Saunders, Vicar Of Dibley, Little Britain and The Office.

He was also an executive producer of the Olympic satire Twenty Twelve, which won a Bafta.

The Queen hosts the majority of investitures but shares the role with the Prince of Wales and the Princess Royal.

Around
25 investitures are held each year, with most staged in the ballroom at
Buckingham Palace, but others take place at the Palace of Holyroodhouse
in Edinburgh and at Windsor Castle.
