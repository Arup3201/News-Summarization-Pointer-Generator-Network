A 52-year-old Michigan man accused of murdering his sister and her husband in a crime of incestuous passion became combative in court this week when he took to the stand to answer questions about his inappropriate sibling relationship.

Prosecutors argued that it was Ryan Wyngarden's sexual history with sister Gail Brink that caused him to fatally shoot her and husband Rick out of jealousy on November 21, 1987 - just 18 months after the couple were wed.

The Brinks' murder was a cold case for many years until Wyngarden's wife Pam came forward to authorities, saying her husband confessed to killing the couple as well as revealing the fact that he had an incestuous relationship with his sister.

Combative: Wyngarden had to be warned several times not to talk out of order when he became argumentative in court yesterday

Suspect: Ryan Wyngarden, 52, argued with prosecutors in court yesterday as they questioned him about the incestuous relationship he had with his sister, who was murdered along with her husband in 1987. Wyngarden is pictured in court on Tuesday

Crime of passion: Rick and Gail Bring were found murdered in their Park Township, Michigan home on November, 21 1987. Prosecutors are arguing that their deaths were carried out by a jealous Wyngarden

At a hearing last year, Pam recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating.

Case reopened: The Brink murders were a cold case for many years until Wyngarden's wife came forward, and told authorities that her husband confessed to the crimes. He was arrested last year and wrote 29 letters to wife Pam, trying to discourage her from testifying

'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, "What's wrong?" and he said, "I shot and killed Rick and Gail". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.'

When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said.

But in court this week, Wyngarden tried to convince the jury that those sexually-related incidents wouldn't have provided a motive for killing his sister.

In his testimony, Wyngarden admitted to having three sexual experiences with Gail, but denied the two ever had intercourse.

The first instance happened when Wyngarden was 12 and his sister was nine.

He said they were naked and 'just playing around...comparing body parts' when their mom came into the room.

'There was nothing sexual about it,' he said.

The next time the two had a sexual encounter was one or two years later when the siblings were smoking marijuana.

'We just groped on each other a little bit. There was no clothing that ever came off. That was pretty much that,' he said.

The final instance happened when Wyngarden was 15 and again involved marijuana.Wyngarden described the encounter as 'consensual' and says the two touched genitals but it didn't escalate to sex.

'My sister did not lose her virginity to me,' he said.

Those he confided in about the incest, including his other sister Lynn, say he wanted to apologize to Gail because 'he felt like he raped her'.

'I wouldn't have killed my sister over this,' an emotional Wyngarden said.

Having to talk about the sexual encounters caused Wyngarden to become antagonistic with the prosecutor, constantly talking out of turn.

At one point the judge had to order the jury out of the court room so he could warn Wyngarden not to talk over the prosecutor.

'Mr. Wyngarden, you canâ€™t argue with me,' the judge said. 'This isnâ€™t going to end well for you with the jury.'

It was also revealed in court this week that Wyngarden tried to convince his wife Pam not to testify in the trial after he was arrested for the murders last year.

He sent 29 letters to Pam in the span of six months while he was in jail waiting for arrival, sometimes threatening her with God's spite.

'I am beyond belief that Pam sticks to this lie, but I truly believe God's light will bring the truth' he wrote in one letter.

Wyngarden's defense attorney is arguing that the Brinks were victims in a case of a mistaken identity.

The couple had recently moved into a home vacated by residents who had links to the narcotics trade and connections to a Detroit-area biker game.

Wyngarden is facing two charges of first-degree murder and could serve life in prison if convicted.
