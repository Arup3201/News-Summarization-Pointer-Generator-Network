Barack Obama has made it quite clear he believes it would be game over for the U.S. if the Republicans get into power next year.

But the President still seems sure his two daughters are on the road to success - even if the country he runs falls flat on its face.

He told supporters at a campaign event on Wednesday in Manhattan, New York, that he doesn’t worry about Malia, 13, and Sasha, 10.

‘Our kids are going to be fine,’ President Obama, 50, said last night. ‘And I always tell Malia and Sasha, look, you guys, I don't worry about you.

‘I mean, I worry the way parents worry - but they’re on a path that is going to be successful, even if the country as a whole is not successful.

‘But that’s not our vision of America. I don't want an America where my kids are living behind walls and gates, and can’t feel a part of a country that is giving everybody a shot.’

He spoke at a $10,000-a-person fundraiser in the home of supporters Jack and Phyllis Rosen about his last three years in office.

‘I don't think any of us realised what an extraordinary transformation would be taking place over these last several years,’ he said.

'Our kids are going to be fine. And I always tell Malia and Sasha, look, you guys, I don't worry about you. I mean, I worry the way parents worry - but they’re on a path that is going to be successful, even if the country as a whole is not successful'

‘They've been tough years for the American people. They've been tough for the world.  And we're not out of the woods yet.’

President Obama often talks highly of his two children, saying they are kind, respectful, responsible and well-behaved girls.

‘I could not ask for better kids,’ he told ABC News in June. ‘I'm not anticipating complete mayhem for the next four, five years.

‘But I understand teenage-hood is complicated. I should also point out that I have men with guns that surround them often.’
