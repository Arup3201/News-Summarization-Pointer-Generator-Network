Paul Jewell walked out of West Bromwich Albion after only a week in the job after being asked to accept a pay-cut that in turn would cover the salary of another new coach; Gerry Francis.

In consultation with his legal team the former Wigan, Ipswich and Derby manager is now understood to be considering a case of constructive dismissal.

Having agreed the terms of his employment to become assistant head coach to new boss Tony Pulis – indeed he was even sent a draft of his contract by the club – Jewell was then staggered to find himself being asked to accept a revised salary package.

This, Sportsmail understands, was a request made by Pulis but only after it was made clear to Pulis by his new employers that he could not add Francis to his team if it meant spending more than the agreed figure on his new backroom staff.

Jewell and fellow coach Dave Kemp were asked to consider a pay cut – believed to be less than £20,000 each – last Friday, with Jewell returning on Monday to say that, having given the matter some thought, he was leaving after only seven days into his new role.

While the 50-year-old had not signed the original contract, believed to be worth well in excess of £100,000 a year, he had already begun working for the club on those fiscal terms and he felt his new employers had unilaterally altered his payment. 

The news comes as a blow to Pulis, who is looking to guide West Brom to Premier League safety

While West Brom do not deny the request for a pay-cut was was behind Jewell’s departure, they insisted they had not broken any agreement with Jewell. 'We would dispute most strongly any suggestion that we have reneged on a deal,' said a spokesman.

But a club that has been accused of penny-pinching in the past does appear to have lost a valuable member of its new coaching staff over what seems to be a relatively small amount of money.

Angered by reports in Wednesday’s newspapers that he had left by mutual consent, Jewell issued a statement of his own.

‘My departure was not by mutual consent,’ he said. ‘It is in the hands of my lawyer. I will not be making any further comment at this stage.’ An official club statement issued on Tuesday night said only: ‘Paul Jewell decided that he will not be continuing his recent assistance on a more formal basis.’

Jewell’s appointment represented a bold move by Pulis, who likes to surround himself with experienced deputies. His working relationship with Francis now enters a seventh year.

The former QPR and Tottenham manager had been helping West Brom informally on a part-time basis since the 7-0 Cup win over Gateshead earlier this month.

Asked by Sky on Wednesday if he was unaware of the reasons behind Jewell's departure, he said: ‘I've no idea. He was there Saturday, I was there Saturday at the game. I don't really know what the situation is from that point of view. I only found out myself last night.'

The situation leaves Pulis now searching for another assistant, given that Francis only works part-time. While Jewell has already been linked with a move to Hull to assist Steve Bruce.
