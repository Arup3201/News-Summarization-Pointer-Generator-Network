Spared jail: Killer Alison Richardson, 46, arriving at court earlier in her trial

A woman who killed her boyfriend and then went on to abuse vulnerable patients after she was employed as a health care assistant has escaped jail.

Alison Richardson - who jailed for manslaughter after stabbing her boyfriend to death in 1993 - was handed a suspended sentence after being caught on CCTV abusing a patient at The Priory hospital in Middleton St George, near Darlington.

The 46-year-old, who fully disclosed her conviction when she was hired, jammed a bin onto a female patient’s head following a ‘tussle’.

She later put her hands around the same patient’s throat in a ‘throttling position’, shaking her and poking her in the ribs. Other patients and members of staff were present during both assaults.

Detective Constable Fiona Laws said: 'She denied everything in formal interviews, never showed any remorse and never admitted any wrong-doing.

'She was in a position of trust at the hospital, working alongside other members of staff caring for vulnerable patients.

'The assaults represented a loss of control and abuse of that trust.'

Graham Hunsley, mitigating, described Richardson’s actions as horseplay gone too far, saying they reflected a lack of training at the private hospital.

He asked District Judge Andrew Meachin to show leniency on the basis that the assaults were without malice.

Judge Meachin, sentencing Richardson at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates Court, repeatedly expressed astonishment that somebody with Richardson’s background was allowed to work with vulnerable people and questioned whether the hospital had been investigated as a result.

Describing the situation as ‘disturbing’, he said: 'This young lady has a certain conviction and has ended up in a position of carer, working one to one with a group of teenagers with certain difficulties.

'She went too far and was given certain leeway in doing so. The incidents were a serious breach of trust and she was in a position she shouldn’t have been in.'

Richardson, who now lives in Hull, previously admitted two counts of assault by beating. Five other charges were dropped.

Sentencing her to four months imprisonment for each offence, suspended for 12 months, the judge said: 'You came to believe you could act in a certain way with these people.

'The term play fighting has been used and that is unbelievable, you went far too far and there was an element of humiliation.'

Following the events, the hospital was warned by the Care Quality Commission for putting patients at significant risk’ by failing to conduct risk assessments relating to the suitability of employees to work with vulnerable people.

A spokesman from The Priory said the decision to employ Richardson was taken by previous owners Affinity Healthcare.

She said: 'The decision to employ this person and change her role was taken under the previous ownership of the hospital.

Sentence: Alison Richards was given the suspended sentence at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court. The judge said he was surprised she had ever been employed caring for the vulnerable

'This has been dealt with, and under the new senior management at the hospital a robust review has been undertaken.

'The hospital has apologised to the victim of this offence. It has robust procedures, including routine CCTV recordings, in place to safeguard patients and staff alike.

'In this isolated incident, our CCTV footage indicated unacceptable behaviour which acted as crucial evidence in this matter.

'We were therefore able to take immediate and vigorous action to protect patients by referring the matter to the Police, suspending and then dismissing the employee involved.'
