The Philippines military has been pictured handing huge wads of cash to masked informants, who gave up information on al-Qaeda-linked terrorists, in a bid to encourage more sources to come forward. 

An astonishing series of photographs show four tipsters clasping bounties of up to 5.3 million Philippines pesos ($120,454) each inside the military headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo, east of Manila.

The military released the photographs to illustrate the huge rewards available to police sources, in a bid to encourage more informants to come forward – but the men pictured are clad in hoods, heavy jackets and sunglasses to protect their identities.

The rewards follow the arrest of suspected of members of Abu Sayyaf - an extremist group of al-Qaeda-linked militants responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the Philippines.

According to local reports, Armed Forces of the Philippines deputy chief of staff, Lt. Gen. John Bonafos handed over a total of 12.1 million Philippines pesos ($270,000) to the four informants.

It is thought they assisted in the arrest of a rebel leader of the New People's Army (NPA) - named as Maria Loida Tuzo Magpatoc - as well as members Abu Sayyaf.

Reports state that Magpatoc, also known as 'Gwen' and 'Bebyang', carried a reward of 5.6 million Philippines pesos ($125,000) on her head. 

The military believe The NPA, whic is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands, as well as kidnappings of locals and foreigners.

The Abu Sayyaf members arrested  were identified as Basal Talb Sali and Abu Husni, who carried a reward of 5.3 million Philippines pesos ($118,000) for their arrest, and Muktar Ladjaperma and Jailanl Basirul, who carried a 600,000 Philippines pesos ($13,000) reward for their arrest.

The Abu Sayyaf has also been held responsible for high-profile kidnapping for ransom cases involving foreign hostages.

The group claims it is fighting to establish an independent Islamic homeland in the Muslim populated south of the mainly Catholic Philippines.

In July, a video appeared on Youtube in which one of the Abu Sayyaf's leaders, Isnilon Hapilon, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State extremists who have taken control of large parts of Iraq and Syria.

But local authorities regard the group as a non-idealogical band of criminals chiefly focused on the lucrative business of kidnapping for ransom.

Earlier this month, a Swiss man kidnapped by the group escaped after nearly three years in captivity following a fierce struggle with one of his captors over a machete.

It is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, which has provided military assistance and training to Filipino troops to hunt down the group.

The Philippines military hope the rewards will encourage more sources to come forward with information
