It is fair to say Leeds United fans are not exactly cock-a-hoop over David Hockaday.

How does a man sacked from Forest Green Rovers in the Conference Premier after losing seven of eight games next land the main job at arguably the biggest club outside the Premier League?

Confused, and not a little angry, Leeds supporters can be forgiven for never having heard Hockaday’s name before Italian owner Massimo Cellino plucked him from obscurity.

Forest Green was Hockaday’s managerial debut and the team ended his first season in the relegation places, only to be saved by Salisbury City getting punished with demotion instead for financial irregularities.

Another season of struggle followed before Ecotricity owner Dale Vince completed a takeover and supplied Hockaday with the division’s healthiest budget.

Despite this the side finished 10th in consecutive seasons and by this campaign the 56-year-old was receiving abuse from the stands. During a 4-1 defeat to Kidderminster last October his own supporters sung: ‘F*** off Dave Hockaday’ and ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’. He managed two more defeats before being given his P45.

But there is another side to that story. Some observers felt the style of football he implemented – 4-3-3, passing – was commendable but players were simply not adequately skilled. Such tactics might work with a Championship squad.

Also, while he possessed big-name players at non-league level accusations were levelled that once they had their pay cheques performing on a Saturday came secondary. Mentality was the problem. Still, it was Hockaday’s responsibility to motivate.

An ability to developing players on the coaching field is what Leeds have trumpeted and his roles at Watford and Southampton are testament to that.

Watford won promotion to the top-flight in 2006 with Hockaday on the staff. He had joined with Graham Taylor manager in 2000 as Under-18 coach and brought through Ashley Young among others.

But Bothroyd replaced Hockaday with Malky Mackay in January 2007 as the team struggled in and he was also dismissed from Southampton two years later.

His playing career was largely spent at Swindon Town and Blackpool playing as right-back. This appointment by Cellino is as left-field as they come.
