They may not look like the most spacious, or glamorous, of buildings. 

But these shipping containers have been earmarked as a novel way to tackle the housing crisis in Detroit, Michigan. 

In one of the city's sprawling factories, the first converted shipping container is being constructed and it is hoped it might potentially be a model for the future. 

The first shipping container converted home is being constructed in a Detroit General Motors factory 

It is hoped the shipping container idea could take off and be used as a way to tackle the city's housing crisis

Once the finishing touches have been applied, the container will be delivered to Michigan Urban Farming Initiative's headquarters in Detroit's North End neighborhood. 

It will serve as a base for university student caretakers for the nonprofit group and agricultural research activities.

The 40-foot long container will feature 320 square feet of living space with two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. 

It is hoped the shipping container idea could go some way to helping Detroit's housing problems - the city has roughly 40,000 vacant homes waiting to be demolished. 

Tyson Gersh, from the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, said: 'It's scalable, works for everyone and it's also not going to ruin the environment. It's easier to maintain and can re-purpose existing materials.'

The home is being prepared inside General Motors' Hamtramck Assembly plant in the city, which usually produces the electric Chevrolet Volt and other vehicles. 

Mr Gersh and others from the farming group met with the automaker a couple years ago, and came up with the idea. 

GM spokesman David Darovitz said: 'I loved the creative idea of taking and reusing an old shipping container and giving new life. It can be used as a model for a bigger idea.'

The unusual building is viewed as a way to tackle the deteriorating and disappearing housing in Detroit 

Shipping containers converted in to living or working spaces are common in some other cities. 

For instance, in Salt Lake City's rundown warehouse district, a nonprofit group last year converted them into 'micro-retail' spaces.

It was in 2006 that California architect Peter DeMaria designed the first two-story shipping container home in the US, Redondo Beach Home. 

This in turn inspired the creation of Logical Homes, a company based on the idea of converting containers in to homes.
