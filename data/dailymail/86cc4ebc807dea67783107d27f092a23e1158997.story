You might look at your desk and think it looks pretty clean. 

But a gruesome new video shows how it could be riddled with invisible bacteria all the way from the bathroom - and is easily spread to your hands and mouth.

As one in four office workers fail to wash their hands after going to the loo, anything from the door to the keyboard and computer mouse is covered with millions of bacteria.

In order to avoid getting ill, experts have revealed the best ways to try and remain as germ-free as possible.

Flushing the loo without putting the seat down causes a 'sneeze effect', in which bacteria is sprayed all over the cubicle and can cover surfaces as far as 20 feet away

Bacteria spreads throughout the office. Previous studies have revealed 3,000 organisms per square inch on a keyboard or over 1,600 on a computer mouse

Touching the keyboard and then later eating lunch transfers the bacteria from the hands to the mouth 

Using hand sanitiser throughout the day can stop the spread of bacteria, experts say

It's known 16 per cent of people carry the norovirus – which causes vomiting and diarrhoea – but show no symptoms

Dr Lisa Ackerley, Professorial Fellow at the Royal Society of Public Health, warns of the 'sneeze effect' when flushing the toilet.

Failing to put the toilet lid down before flushing means bacteria is sprayed and can cover surfaces as far away as 20 feet.

She said: ‘If you go to the toilet and you don’t put the lid down before you flush, when you do flush the germs that are in the toilet will spread around the toilet cubicle.

‘This means they could land on the toilet seat or toilet paper itself and that means they could be spread on your hands and other surfaces later on.’ 

To combat the sneeze effect, use an antibacterial seat cleaner to wipe the germs away, she added.

Usually after going to the toilet we have around 200 million bacteria per square inch on each hand.

And hands contaminated with viruses can transfer them to five more surfaces or 14 other subjects.

In fact, U.S. researchers found that when they contaminated a single doorknob or table top with a 'tracer virus' it spread through an office building, hotel or healthcare facility within two to four hours.

After using the bathroom one hand has 200 million bacteria per square inch, often picked up from the toilet paper or toilet seat 

Contaminated hands transfer viruses to five more surfaces or 14 other people. Previous research found viruses can spread through and office within two to four hours

700 harmful bacteria inhabit car interiors., but almost half of illnesses can be reduced by washing hands effectively, experts advised

Dr Ackerley continued: ‘We know from studies 3,000 organisms per square inch can be found on a keyboard or over 1,600 a computer mouse. 

‘Over the course of a day you might be picking up those bacteria and then if you suddenly decide to have lunch at your desk without washing your hands first, you’re basically transferring those bacteria into your mouth.’ 

It's known 16 per cent of people carry the norovirus – which causes vomiting and diarrhoea – but show no symptoms.

'So you may feel perfectly fine and well but you’re carrying around the virus and spreading it around the office’ Dr Ackerley said.

She recommended using a hand sanitiser after leaving the bathroom, and over the course of the day.

Office workers come into contact with 10 million bacteria every day, with many spreading the norovirus around the office without knowing it

A keyboard is covered with 3,295 organisms per square inch and a computer mouse riddled with 1,676 organisms per square inch

A phone is covered in 25,127 organisms per square inch which can be transferred to the face and mouth

‘This means if someone else has forgotten to wash their hands you won’t pick up their germs and then spread them around the office.’

But the most effective ways to stop infection in the office is simply washing hands, she said.

Around half of illnesses can be reduced by people simply washing their hands effectively.

And just 20 seconds of hand washing can stop the journey of the germ.

Ensuring the hands are thoroughly dry after a wash is important too,added Dr Ackerley.

‘It’s been found germs are more likely to be transferred to other surfaces if they’re damp.

‘So dry your hands completely and you’ve done the job.’ 

Washing hands after going to the bathroom and drying them thoroughly is essential, as 80 per cent of infections are spread by hand
