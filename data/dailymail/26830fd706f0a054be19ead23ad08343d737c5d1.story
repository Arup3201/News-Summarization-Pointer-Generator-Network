One of the hostages rescued in a daring raid on a remote Afghan cave has spoken for the first time of the dramatic SAS rescue mission and their perilous dash to safety.

Aid worker Moragwa Oirere and her British colleague Helen Johnston were thought to be hours away from execution when David Cameron ordered Special Forces to make the 1am swoop on their captors’ hideout.

Now Miss Oirere has told of the ‘terrible’ firefight that left five of the kidnappers dead – and of how the fearless troops helped them scramble barefoot for miles over rocks and mountains in pitch darkness until they could be airlifted out of harm’s way.

Miss Johnston, from Cambridge, and Miss Oirere, from Kenya, were on a mercy mission to bring health-care and medicine to mothers and babies in isolated communities

The 26-year-old described how the stillness of the night in the so-called ‘Valley of the Ants’ in the isolated province of Badakhshan, in north-eastern Afghanistan, was shattered by the surgical rescue operation 

She said: ‘I didn’t even know what sounds I was hearing when the soldiers came. I was in a deep sleep and I’d never heard a gunshot or a bomb explosion in my life. I know now that the British troops were killing the kidnappers, a terrible sound.

‘Helen and I were groggy from sleep, but we were pulled out of the cave and found ourselves being rushed towards safety.’

But the flight out of the steep-sided valley to the waiting helicopter was not easy. ‘We had no shoes on so the soldiers had to carry us in their arms,’ Miss Oirere said. ‘It was a pitch-black night and very cold. We climbed up stony mountainsides and down through valleys.

‘The soldiers had already done the difficult journey to come and find us, and there was a terrible shoot-out with the kidnap gang.

‘But they talked to us, comforted us and carried us, all the way back to the helicopter. We thank them and we thank God for saving our lives.’

Last weekend’s joint British and American-led operation came after the two women and their two Afghan translators had spent 12 terrifying days in captivity, drinking water made from melted snow and living in constant fear for their lives.

The heavily armed criminal gang, who demanded a £7 million ransom, had seized the group from the  charity Medair on May 22 as they were crossing the mountains on horseback.

Their cameras, mobile phones, laptops and wallets were stolen and the group was taken at gunpoint to a cave. Shortly afterwards they were moved to another.

‘We stayed in the second cave for about a week,’ said Miss Oirere. ‘There were no comforts but the kidnappers needed to keep us alive.

‘We were given adequate food and there was water from melted snow. Helen and I comforted each other and that helped us both. After that we were moved to a third cave, and that was where we were rescued.

‘I’m still very shaken by what we went through. Twelve days seemed like a lifetime and there was no knowing when or if it would ever end.’

After their escape, the two women were flown to the Afghan capital Kabul for medical checks and a  military debriefing.

Miss Johnston, from Cambridge, and Miss Oirere, from Kenya, were on a mercy mission to bring health-care and medicine to mothers and babies in isolated communities.

Now safely back home with her family in Ngong, near Nairobi, Miss Oirere declared: ‘It’s not just a job to me, it’s a calling. I felt sure it was the right thing to do and I would probably do it again. But I need to spend time just getting back to  normal now. I know my parents and my brothers went through a lot, not knowing if I would survive this.’

She said she had never ridden a horse before but agreed to tackle the eight-hour journey because of her desire to help mothers in a region where maternal death rates are among the highest in the world.

Special forces swooped in on the cave where Miss Johnston and Miss Oirere were being held captive in the isolated Badakhshan province and carried them to a helicopter to be airlifted out

Miss Oirere has been receiving counselling at her home, an imposing hilltop house where she lives with her two older brothers and her parents, Naftali, a doctor, and his teaching consultant wife Milcah.

She said she hoped to enjoy a reunion with 28-year-old Miss Johnston – a nutrition expert who trained at the London School of Medicine and Tropical Hygiene – because their ordeal had brought them so close together. Miss Johnston, who has still to talk about her ordeal, was said by friends last night to be ‘resting’.

Miss Oirere’s father told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It would be good for Moragwa to talk to Helen. The two girls hardly knew each other before but the dreadful circumstances of their kidnap have brought them close. I think they need each other.’

Dr Oirere added that he was monitoring his daughter’s health, saying: ‘She seems physically fine but we are concerned. It’s very early days and she often breaks down.’

He also said that the conditions in Afghanistan had taken his daughter by surprise. ‘She has been to some remote, arid areas but I don’t think she was prepared for the scale of that hard, barren landscape,’ he added.

After the operation, David Cameron praised the rescue team, which also included members of the New Zealand SAS, American Rangers and Navy Seals, and Afghan special forces called the Tiger

Teams. He said: ‘We will never be able to publish their names but the whole country should know we have an extraordinary group of people who work for us who do amazingly brave things.’
