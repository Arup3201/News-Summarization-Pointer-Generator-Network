Tim Sherwood has admitted that he wasn't shocked to be sacked by Tottenham, despite leading the club to a sixth-placed finish and qualification for next season's Europa League

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy relieved Sherwood of his duties in a meeting on Tuesday, bringing an end to his spell in charge at White Hart after just five months.

And Sherwood, who is already looking forward to getting back into management, insists he has no issue with Levy's decision.

Man in charge: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy informed Sherwood of his decision in a meeting on Tuesday

Speaking as a pundit during ITV 4's Europa League final coverage, Sherwood said: 'Put it this way, I didn't fall off my chair when he (Levy) told me. It wasn't that much of a shock, but it's obviously a disappointment to lose my job. A job that I thought I'd done reasonably well in.

'I have to respect the decision of the club. It's a massive football club. It's going to be bigger than any manager who comes in and any of the players who are there. I've got full respect for their decision.'

The 45-year-old enjoyed mixed fortunes on and off the pitch during his time in charge, but he believes the experience of managing in the Premier League has taught him a lot.

'It was a massive learning curve. It was my first opportunity to manage. I did see a transfer window, but I decided not to make any signings,' he said.

'I've seen it all - wins, draws, losses and a few tantrums. And I've seen the sack, which I didn't want to see. I experienced a lot in that five months and I'll certainly learn from it.'

Sherwood's honest nature in press 
conferences and interviews is believed to have been a contributing 
factor in his demise, but the ex-Blackburn midfielder won't change his 
style.

He said: 'Would I do it any differently? Probably not. I want to be true to myself and that's the way I want to adapt things. We'll see if another door opens. Onto the next one, as they say.'

Sherwood is keen to find a new job as soon as possible, with links to the vacancy at Championship side Brighton growing after news of his sacking by Tottenham.

He added: 'Peversely I like doing it - anyone who wants to do that job must be crazy. I knew what I was going into - a lot of pressure and it occupies your mind totally.

'You're waking up in the middle of the night thinking of teams - who should play and who shouldn't. But I really liked it and really enjoyed it. I can't wait to get back in.'
