ARSENAL

Borsussia Dortmund

Galatasaray

Anderlecht 

Arsenal were handed a difficult group in the Champions League despite being placed amongst the top seeds.

Arsene Wenger's side were drawn against 2013 finalists Borussia Dortmund in perhaps the toughest group they could have been given.

The two sides met in last season's group stage, with Arsenal losing at home but winning against Jurgen Klopp's team in Germany.  

Tough task: Arsenal's reward for beating Besiktas is a group featuring two top sides

Borussia Dortmund

Arsenal's Head-to-head: P 6 W 3 L 2 D 1

Star man: Marco Reus

Manager: Jurgen Klopp

Stadium: Westfalenstadion

European pedigree: Although not traditionally a giant of European football, over the past few years Dortmund have become on of the most feared sides in the Champions League. 

Klopp built a fabulous squad which shocked Real Madrid on the way to the 2013 final, and despite selling Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski to domestic rivals Bayern Munich, they are still a threat.

Did you know: Borussia Dortmund reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season, despite having a smaller wage bill than Championship QPR.

Galatasaray

Arsenal's Head-to-head: P 1 W 0 L 0 D 1

Star man: Wesley Sneijder

Manager: Cesare Prandelli

Stadium: Turk Telekom Arena

European pedigree: Champions League regulars, but the Turks haven't been past the quarter-finals in the past two decades. 

However, they won the UEFA Cup in 2000, beating Arsenal on penalties in the final, and have managed to get out of their groups in each of the last two seasons.

Did you know: Galatasaray's trip to the Emirates will see a return for former Arsenal favourite Emmanuel Eboue. The Ivorian full-back spent six years with the Gunners and became an unlikely hero after once being booed off the pitch by his own supporters.

Anderlecht

Arsenal's Head-to-head: P 2 W 1 L 1 D 0

Star man: Steven Defour

Manager: Besnik Hasi

Stadium: Constant Vanden Stock Stadium

European pedigree: A well-known name in European football, but always just outside of the elite. Last season saw Anderlecht pick up just one point in the Champions League group stages and, despite a talented young squad, they can expect little more this time.

Did you know: Arsenal's only previous meeting with Anderlecht came in the final of the 1970 Fairs Cup, when they won 4-3 on aggregate (1-3 away, 3-0 at home)

Re-match: Robert Lewandowski, now departed from Dortmund, scored twice at the Emirates last season

Achievable: Arsenal hit back in Germany and managed to get out of their group in second place last year

Excited: Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta didn't seem too unhappy with a difficult draw

The Gunners will have to travel to Turkey to face Galatasaray in one of the most daunting trips European football has to offer.

Arsenal have already seen off Turkish side Besiktas in qualifying but struggled in the away leg, which they drew 0-0.

On paper the easiest game Arsenal will play is against Belgian champions Anderlecht, but they will face a struggle to top the group and potentially avoid the biggest names in Europe in the second round.
