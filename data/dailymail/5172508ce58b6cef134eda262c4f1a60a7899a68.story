Orlando’s streets have been paved in purple, and gold, as the city embraces football and its newest sports team.

Orlando City face Frank Lampard’s future club New York City in a battle of the MLS debutants on Sunday evening in Florida’s Citrus Bowl stadium.

But the night before, the city was gripped with football fever as the club created their own festival downtown. Everything was awash with the purple and gold-trimmed Orland kit.

A city has warmly welcomed its newest arrival, coming out in their hoards and spending their hard-earned dollars to don the gear and get behind the team.

There was even a band brought in to play live to the thronging masses where a whole street was closed off. At one stage, as an item of clothing was thrown amongst the crowd it caught in a light fixing above.

'That's for the soccer Gods,' the lead singer roared and the audience duly erupted in delight (perhaps not the person who lost their jacket).

In a country where American Football, basketball and ice hockey already vie for the nations' attention, he could even be forgiven for calling it 'soccer.' 

But they might have to start finding a new name for their beloved NFL if football keeps growing over here at this rate.

New York City have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase

David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City

Brazilian star Kaka will also play in the match on Sunday, for the new MLS franchise Orlando City

Orlando’s main other sports team, basketball’s Orlando Magic, are struggling and in these parts a new rival has waltzed in.

The entire city was painted purple leading up to the match; signs, posters and banners everywhere.

Americans certainly know how to celebrate a sporting occasion. The pre-match partying went well into the early hours, but they did not let sore heads stand in the way of preparing for the game.

The fans were out in force again in the hours leading up to kick-off, the smell of barbecues strong in air around the stadium as they set up marquees and settled in for the long haul.

Frank Lampard will join the MLS revolution at New York City in the summer when his loan at Man City ends

Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be at the game and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out'

Lampard and Steven Gerrard are soon to join the league, this summer, but even before then they already have Kaka, once considered the greatest player on the planet, at Orlando City and David Villa at New York City, amongst a growing list of prominent names.

Hopefully Saturday night’s celebrations did not keep up the New York City squad staying in a nearby hotel, where just that morning Claudio Reyna, their director of football operations, had sat having a contrastingly quiet and relaxed breakfast with his family.

There is a sell-out 63,000-strong stadium to entertain.

Kaka - Orlando City SC

The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass.

Frank Lampard – New York City FC

One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City.

Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy

The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane.

David Villa - New York City FC

Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season.

Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls

Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.
