Professor John Ashton has stepped down from his role within the Faculty of Public Health following a vicious Twitter spat

A prominent Government health adviser has been forced to stand aside for sending abusive messages on Twitter.

Professor John Ashton stepped down as president of the Faculty of Public Health yesterday following a venomous spat on the social media site.

The doctor, who is strongly opposed to e-cigarettes, called one supporter a ‘c***’.

In another tweet he said: ‘These abusive ecig people remind me of the lads who used to play with themselves behind the bike sheds at school. 

'They are even more pathetic than that. 

'Need ecigs to get aroused.’

He had been involved in a debate about the merits and dangers of e-cigarettes. 

Advocates say they help smokers quit, while objectors such as Prof Ashton – who want tighter controls – are concerned about their long-term effects.

They also believe the tobacco industry is using e-cigarettes to lure youngsters into smoking.

In the online debate, Prof Ashton complained he was being abused by e-cig ‘trolls’ and accused them of being apologists for the industry.

He hit back at one, saying: ‘Have you always been an anonymous c***.’

And he told another: ‘I think I have identified a new species of human being this week. 

'Obsessive, compulsive, abusive onanist with ecig tendencies.’

As president of the faculty, which is independent of Government, he gives advice to ministers on public health.

A statement posted on its website stated the faculty ‘apologises unreservedly’ for Prof Ashton’s comments.

While some say e-cigarettes are better for health, others, like Professor Ashton, worry about their long term effects 

It said: ‘Professor Ashton used inappropriate and offensive language, which unnecessarily personalised a public health issue, and we do not condone its use. An investigation is currently under way.’

Earlier in the week Prof Ashton tweeted: ‘I very much regret my choice of language to describe some vapers... and any offence caused.’
