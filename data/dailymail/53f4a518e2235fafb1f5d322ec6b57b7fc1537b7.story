Gunned down: Modesto Pellino was shot seven times in front of dozens of people in the busy central square in Nettuno, near Rome

Fears are growing that Rome may be at the centre of a Mafia turf war after a gangster was gunned down in a busy square.

Modesto Pellino, 46, was on the phone when he was shot seven times in front of dozens of people in the central square of Nettuno, near the Italian capital.

More than two dozen similar execution-style killings have been carried out on Rome's streets in the last year, as organised criminals from the capital and elsewhere battle over territory and interests in drugs and extortion.

Pellino had previous convictions and known links with the Moccia clan of Naples's Camorra, one of Italy's oldest and largest criminal organisations which dates back to the 18th century.Â 

Zaratti Filiberto, chairman of the Lazio region's security and crime prevention commission, said police chiefs had warned that rival gangs from different Mafia groups were operating in and around the capital.

'This is the umpteenth episode of tit-for-tat in an area where the clans have been jockeying for dominance for some time,' he told La Repubblica newspaper.

'After some months of silence the gunfire has returned... The brutality of the murder, carried out in broad daylight in one of the city's main squares shows how worryingly powerful organised crime has become in this area.'

Experts believe the rise in violence may be linked to the resurgence of Rome's Magliana gang.

Younger elements of the gang are fighting over the drug trade, possibly in conflict with members of southern Mafia groups such as Camorra and 'Ndrangheta, the Independent reported.

Rome's mayor, Gianni Alemanno, has admitted the city is suffering an 'assault by organised crime, the like of which we haven't seen since the 1970s'.

Opposition politicians say the capital has become the new 'Wild West' and have accused Alemanno of failing to keep his promise to clean it up.
