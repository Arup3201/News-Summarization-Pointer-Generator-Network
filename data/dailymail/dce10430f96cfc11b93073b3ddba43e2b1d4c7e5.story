MPs have complained that rules around dinner expenses are not generous enough, they do not get as big a meal allowance as soldiers and that they cannot claim for 'a large lunch at lunchtime'.

Labour MP Thomas Docherty said it is 'ludicrous' that MPs from outside of London have to wait until 7.30pm to claim for an evening meal when they are required to be at the House of Commons for late sittings.

At a House of Commons administration committee hearing, Kevan Jones, a shadow Labour defence minister and MP for North Durham, said that MPs are only given £15 a night towards their evening meals while civil servants get about £24.

He claimed a colleague told him that serving soldiers receive a £29 allowance, but the Ministry of Defence told the Daily Telegraph that soldiers get £25 to cover all three meals if they are away from their base on a course.

MPs earn at least £65,738, with extra money for ministerial roles.

Mr Docherty, MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, asked the Independent Parliamentary Standards Committee's policy director John Sills to consider letting MPs have a subsistence allowance.

Mr Jones said he 'might choose to have a large lunch at lunchtime', but he is not allowed to claim it back.

He said: 'I never claim the £15 full amount, but what you have now stopped doing, which I cannot quite understand, is if, for example, I choose at lunchtime to have a meal and then have a snack in the evening, you will not pay for the one at lunchtime.

'You will perhaps pay for the snack in the evening, even if it all comes to less than £15.'

Administration committee chair Sir Alan Haselhurst, the Tory MP for Saffron Walden, said: 'Some declared in their election manifestos that they would not claim for the overnight cost of eating when they were away.

Mr Docherty said it was 'ludicrous' that MPs that are not from London have to wait until after 7.30pm for an evening meal if they are to claim it back when the House of Commons sits late

'If you are a businessman away you would normally get remunerated for the actual costs. For those that have come down from distant places, they are here for three nights probably, in which case they eat more than one meal a day.

'It would be helpful to some new aspiring Members not to find themselves trapped into declarations, which then, when they get here, they find are very uncomfortable.'

Mr Docherty told the Daily Telegraph: 'I have no problem with the receipts or with the figure of £15. My point is that it’s ludicrous that the test that is applied is the House of Commons Chamber sitting at 7.31pm. That in itself is not the only measure of what MPs are doing.'

Mr Jones told the newspaper: 'Things like the subsistence allowance seem very arbitrary in the way they are being implemented. What we need to do is simplify the system to make it less bureaucratic for claiming and cheaper for the taxpayer.'
