A Florida teacher and her 58-year-old boyfriend have been accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl.

Kimberly Honaker, 48, had been charged on Saturday with child neglect for allegedly failing to intervene to stop Robert Pruitt sexually abusing a child.

But on Tuesday Honaker, who has been suspended from the middle school she worked at for 17 years, was arrested again over claims that she had also molested the young girl.

When the language teacher was arrested for a second time, she was charged with lewd molestation and the use of a child in a sexual performance.

The couple's alleged victim has been put in the care of the Florida Department of Children and Families.

The couple were arrested after Pruitt's 
ex-wife alerted police to Facebook messages, texts and emails that 
suggested an inappropriate relationship was taking place.

Pruitt had moved in with Honaker, who he has known for years, in May. Police described the house they shared as being filthy and containing 20 dogs.

Honaker, a mom to twin girls, has been banned from the school campus and is expected to have her pay suspended at the next school meeting, a district spokesman told the Orlando Sentinel.

Police said that the alleged abuse did not take place at the school Honaker works at, but its principal released a statement to students' families earlier this week, announcing the arrest.

'You may see media reports regarding one of our teachers who was arrested this past weekend for a situation unrelated to any of the duties the teacher performed here at our school.

'The teacher has not returned to school since the arrest. We are cooperating fully with law enforcement,' the statement said.

Police told Click Orlando that Pruitt's ex-wife had kicked him out of their home earlier this year after suspecting him of having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old.

He then moved in with Honaker, who is accused of allowing the abuse to continue over the next few weeks.

Honaker and Pruitt are being held without bail at the Orange County Jail.
