Maybe it is a formality, after all. Brendan Rodgers said recently no decision had been made on who would be Liverpool’s next captain but is there really a decision to make?

For all that Liverpool’s manager will not be rushed into anointing Steven Gerrard’s successor, Jordan Henderson is compiling a case that is becoming impossible to overlook. He did exactly what a Liverpool skipper should do, making the difference in a game of great significance.

Fresh from unleashing a thunderbolt that unhinged Manchester City, Henderson delivered once again, with a goal, an assist – his 11th of the season – for Daniel Sturridge and 90-minutes of relentless running in a 2-0 win that enhanced his side’s Champions League ambitions.

Daniel Sturridge caps off a well worked Liverpool move to give his side a 2-0 lead on 51 minutes. 

This may not have been as eye-catching as Sunday’s tour de force but it was no less impressive. They were ruthless, efficient and energetic with excellent performers all over the pitch and in Henderson, Rodgers had someone to set the necessary example.

‘We were talking before the game about how well he (Henderson) is doing,’ noted Sturridge. ‘He is improving in every game and he has taken the responsibility with the armband. He has taken it to the next level.’

These are the types of games that Gerrard, watching in the Directors Box, has grabbed by the scruff of the neck and he would have nodded approvingly at the way Henderson led Liverpool in his absence. So, too, would Rodgers.

Games that come so soon after significant victories can often become tests of endurance rather than opportunities to make statements and there was a reason to believe, having expended so much energy against City, that Burnley could make things difficult.

Liverpool started, however, with intent. Quick, aggressive, energetic, they burst out of the blocks and could have had the lead within 24 seconds when move full of deft flicks and subtle touches, that brought Anfield to its feet, ended with Tom Heaton flinging himself to thwart Sturridge.

Yet Burnley were not daunted. Gerrard noted in his programme notes that “nobody has it easy” against Sean Dyche’s side and they were intent of making this a contest, just as they had done at the Etihad Stadium and Stamford Bridge.

At one point, when Martin Skrtel scuffed a clearance that nearly allowed Burnley to profit, Rodgers span on his heels and shook his head, anxious Liverpool might not capitalise on that big effort three days prior to topple the champions.

His anxieties, though, were soon quelled. Henderson had served notice of his intent in the 24th minute, when forcing a plunging save from Heaton, but there was nothing Burnley’s keeper could do when the ball fell to him on the half-hour and he rifled in a swerving half-volley into the Kop net.

Henderson might not commands big headlines but his importance to this Liverpool team should not be taken for granted and this was a vital contribution, his goal releasing the tension. With 16 months left on his current deal, Liverpool must surely endeavour to finalise a new contract for him. 

‘His strike was terrific and so was the ball for the second goal,’ said Liverpool’s manager. ‘He has wonderful athleticism and is improving all the time. With him learning tactically he will become even better. It was a wonderful performance by him.’

Had Sturridge taken a glorious chance in the 42nd minute, when Coutinho ushered him through, the game would have been wrapped up but, as it was, Liverpool were given a reminder in injury time that they still had work to do when Ashley Barnes tested Simon Mignolet with a header.

Burnley came out fighting at the re-start and Mignolet needed to take dramatic action in the 48th minute when he surged out of his goal to head away a ball that was Barnes was chasing, clattering into the forward in the process.

Henderson’s strike meant Liverpool scored three Premier League goals in a row from outside the penalty area for the first time since 2007.

Yet any hope they had of a comeback was soon extinguished. Liverpool pushed forward, with Lallana bobbing and weaving on the edge of the area, trying to find a way through; Henderson arrived to provide support and his precise cross demanded Sturridge apply the finish touch. Job done.

From that point on, there was never any suggestion Liverpool, who have collected 30 point from the last 36 available, would falter, particularly with Emre Can – the hugely impressive German whom Rodgers labelled as being on the verge of “world-class” – helping Henderson set the tone.

With good reason, Liverpool will be looking at their fixtures in the spring and sensing an opportunity to attack but so, too, do Burnley. This might have been an eighth game without winning but he is not in the mood to thrown in the towel.

‘Liverpool were a different side to the one we (lost to) on Boxing Day,’ said Dyche. ‘I would have taken being in this position with 10 games to go. There are teams under more pressure than we are.’
