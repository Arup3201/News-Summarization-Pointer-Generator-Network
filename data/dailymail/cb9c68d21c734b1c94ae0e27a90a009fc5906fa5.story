They say everyone has a double.

And this man certainly believes so after spotting his doppelganger in an old Victorian photograph.

Steve Cross, 64, saw his own face staring back at him in the faded black-and-white image, which was taken more than 60 years before he was born.

And he is so convinced it is his historic twin that he has even had t-shirts printed with the photo on.

The grandfather-of-four, from Bean, near Dartford, Kent, said: 'They say everyone has a doppelgänger and I've found mine.

'I've showed it to a few people and they all said: "That's definitely you", and my grandchildren said it was me dressed up.'

Mr Cross, a former firefighter who now works in security at Gatwick Airport, was sent the photo of two men at a Victorian funeral by a friend who had spotted the doppelganger. 

He immediately noticed the man on the 
left-hand-side of the image had a similar head shape, eyes, nose and 
even facial hair as him.

He then asked local photographer, Pete Bresser, 55, to picture him dressed up in similar clothing as the mourner - and was stunned by the results.

'When he saw it, he said he couldn't believe his eyes - it was like he was looking back at himself,' Mr Bresser told Kent Online.

After carrying out the internet search, Mr Cross discovered the photo had been taken at least 120 years ago.
