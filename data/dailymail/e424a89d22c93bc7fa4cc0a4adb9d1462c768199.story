A final letter home from an exhausted First World War soldier that his grieving widow carried in her handbag for the rest of her life has come to light.

The poignant note was sent by a war-weary Frederick Swannell, originally from Bethnal Green, London, who wrote how the hellish conditions in the trenches were beating him and how he longed to be returned to his wife and five young children.

The letter makes for heart-rending reading and highlights the terrible toll the conflict had on the men’s mental and physical health.

Within weeks of penning the letter to wife Nell, the dejected Lance Corporal was killed during the Battle of Arras in April 1917.

Unbeknown to her family, his widow kept the touching letter by her side in her handbag for the next 64 years.

It was only after her death that her daughters Elizabeth and Charlotte opened the bag and found their father’s fragile six page letter which they read for the first time.

They were so moved by it that they placed it alongside Nell in her coffin at her funeral.

The family kept a copy of the note and have recently uploaded it to military genealogy website Forces War Records.

L/Cpl's daughters were amazed to discover their father's heartfelt love letter to their mother after her death.

In full, the letter reads: 'My foot is progressing very slowly but lately I have been very bad in health for the conditions I have had to go through out here is gradually telling upon my constitution for I reckon I have stood it well up till now but I feel as I am getting beaten.

'How I wish
 that this terrible anxiety and suspense was over for I do long to be 
with you and our dear little ones who are continually in my mind.

'I
 have done over my bit as you know but it seems no matter how long or 
what you have been through out here they are never done with you

'Let
 us... Hope for a peaceable time for us both and all for if I am lucky 
enough to get through it alright I hope to have a happy and loving life 
with you and our dear little ones for you know I love you and I always 
will and I know you do me.

'I am your ever loving husband Fred Swannell.

'Kisses for you love and my little ones.'

Experts for
 the site were able to provide them with details of L/Cpl Swannell’s 
service record and have now revealed the letter to mark the 100th 
anniversary of the start of the First World War.

Tom Bennington, of Forces War Records, said: 'This letter is beautifully scripted and speaks volumes about the personal cost of the war and the terrible physical and mental toll of trench warfare.

'It was a war the soldiers had grown sick of, not just because of the terrifying bombardments but the stench, mud and disease in the trenches.

'That comes across in Frederick Swannell’s letter. He felt almost beaten by it all and desperately wished for it to end so he could be back home with his family.

'He was clearly most fearful that he would never return home to them.

The letter is undated but it is likely to have been his last as Nell treasured it so much.

On April 28, 1917, L/Cpl Swannell, who served in the Essex Regiment, and his comrades were defending Oppy Wood during the Battle of Arleux which was part of the British offensive on the city of Arras.

On that day he was declared missing, presumed killed. He was aged 35.

His body was never recovered and his name was added to the Arras memorial along with 34,785 British and Commonwealth soldiers with no known grave.

L/Cpl Swannell’s grandson Roger Potts, from Chester, who has been researching his grandfather’s war, said: 'Every time I read the letter it brings a lump to my throat.

'It vividly illustrates the horror of his life at the front and of his desperate wish to be home with his young family.

'With the WWI centenary approaching it is something we want to share so people are aware of the terrible times these brave young men lived through.'

L/Cpl Swannell, from Bethnal Green, East London, was a French polisher before the outbreak of war.

He joined the 13th Battalion of the Essex Regiment in November 1915 and was sent to France.

He fought through many major battles of the war including The Somme in 1916 and then Arras in 1917.
