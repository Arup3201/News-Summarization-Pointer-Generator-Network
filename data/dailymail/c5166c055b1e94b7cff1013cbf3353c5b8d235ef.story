Long-time ‘Jeopardy’ emcee Alex Trebek has been with the quiz show nearly 30 years, but he may be on his way out and this ‘Today’ show host might just replace him. Who is Matt Lauer?

Ratings have plummeted for the ‘Today’ show, which now plays second fiddle to ABC’s ‘Good Morning America’ in the battle for top morning news program.

Ann Curry was the last ‘Today’ host to face the axe for sinking ratings. Now, Matt Lauer’s popularity has hit an all-time low and he’s facing the blame, too.

Way out: Matt Lauer's claim to the daytime throne may have ended, but some say he could move on to host 'Jeopardy' as Alex Trebek exits

Cue Sony Pictures Television, owner of the popular game show, who are now reported by the New York Post to be courting Lauer to be their next host.

Exiting: Alex Trebek has hosted the popular game show since 1984, but his age and health complaints mean his current contract, up in 2016, is his last

Current host Alex Trebek has hosted ‘Jeopardy’ since it was rebooted in 1984. He also suffered his second heart attack last summer and it has been reported that he wants to retire.

Sony has managed to keep Trebek onboard for another three years, however.

Meanwhile, their feelers are now out in search of a new host to replace the man whose name is synonymous with ‘Jeopardy.’

One of those names is Anderson Cooper. The CNN host’s contract is up soon and he’s hosted game shows before—ABC’s ‘The Mole.’

The more likely candidate, however, appears to be Matt Lauer.

Lauer’s
been on ‘Today’ since 1994 and host since 1997. Last year, he signed a 
multi-year contract that was rumored to pay the host a whopping $25 
million per year.

At the
time, NBC News president Steve Capus told the New York Times, 'Matt is 
the franchise, and our franchise player has decided to keep leading our 
team.'

However, since the early 2012 contract signing, things have gotten steadily worse for ‘Today’ and the show has lost its 16-year edge on ‘Good Morning America.’

Many believe Lauer’s sunken popularity may be largely to blame.

This has insiders speculating that Lauer could take seriously the offer of a new gig as ‘Jeopardy’ host.

Lauer’s lucrative ‘Today’ contract ends in 2014, which would give him a long vacation before potentially filling Trebek’s shoes when the ‘Jeopardy’ host ends his own run in 2016.
