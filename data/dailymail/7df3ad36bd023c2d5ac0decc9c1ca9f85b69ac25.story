Bungling Thai police  are to force every man on  Koh Tao to take a DNA test as the fiasco of an investigation into the murders of two British tourists on the island appeared to dry up.

Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe on the beach on September 15.

Police had said their prime suspect was a fisherman who had already fled the island on a private boat.

Killed: Backpacker Hannah Witheridge, 23, was found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe alongside David Miller, 24,  on the beach of Koh Tao on September 15

My hero: It comes as Mr Miller's father said his son died a hero, trying to help fellow victim Miss Witheridge

But today they said they wanted to swab every man across the island including fishermen and boat drivers who may have visited the area at the time of the killings, the BBC reported.

Initial tests show DNA samples found on the bodies almost certainly came from two Asian men, though detectives now believe at least three people were involved in the attack.

But Thai police said they 'still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime'.

Colonel Kissana Phathanachareon cited 'fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David'.

The Bangkok Post last night reported police had narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker.

Picturesque: Police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos

Police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos. Local media in particular have turned on their force, claiming its incompetence stretches way beyond this investigation.

The Thai capital's top-selling English-language newspaper, The Bangkok Post, wrote in an editorial today: 'The handling of the investigation into the murders of British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao is an international scandal and should be a source of deep embarrassment. 

'And it would be, except the egregious lack of professionalism displayed in this case is par for the course for the Thai police force.'

Nevertheless, the commander in charge of the police force sought yesterday to reassure the public that everything was under control.'

Please have confidence in the work of the police. Now we are receiving full cooperation from all parties, especially locals and operators on Koh Tao who keep supplying clues,' Surat Thani police commander Maj Gen Kiatipong Khaosam-ang told the Bangkok post.

It comes as Mr Miller's father said his son died a hero, trying to help fellow victim Miss Witheridge. 

Ian Miller said last night that his 'wonderful boy' was probably killed attempting to save the 23-year-old.

'It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble,' the 57-year-old, from St Helier in Jersey, said. 'That would be absolutely in his character.' 

He spoke as it emerged Miss Witheridge may have been raped by two local men before she was killed on Koh Tao island.

The bodies of the students, who were staying in the same apartment complex, were found last Monday on Sairee Beach.

Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was bludgeoned with a hoe found nearby while Mr Miller, 24, was battered with an unknown 'metal weapon'.

DNA from Miss Witheridge's body came from two Asian men – but did not match any of 12 suspects.

It is claimed she may have spoken with her attackers before being dragged to her death, with Mr Miller killed after coming to her aid.

Officers said it appeared one killer had left his blue shorts at the scene, putting on Mr Miller's 'better quality' beige pair. 

Night before: Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars

Running man: Police are hunting this man filmed running frantically away from the beach on the night of the murders

Last night James Isaacs, a tourist, claimed two British women were recently mugged by a Thai motorbike gang at the spot where the bodies were found.

Mr Miller, a businessman, said the family has not been kept informed by Thai police.

He added: 'We have had very little information here about how they are getting on there. We know they are busy but we haven't got any inside track.'
