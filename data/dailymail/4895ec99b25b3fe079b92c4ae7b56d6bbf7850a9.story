A South Korean woman has been accused of 'ruining her face' after 'before' and 'after' shots of her plastic surgery procedure spread online.

The unnamed woman, allegedly a reporter on a South Korean TV channel, has undergone jaw surgery in order to achieve the dainty heart-shaped face desired by many east Asian women.

South Koreans currently have more plastic surgery than in any other country according to recent figures, with the craze particularly popular among 19 to 49-year-olds.

The result of the procedure is an unusually pointed chin, and the reactions on a Japanese online forum did not hold back.

One used wrote: 'Someone please tell me this was Photoshopped!' while another quipped that 'it looks like you could plow a field with that chin,' RocketNews24 reports.

Another asked: 'Is it really possible to taper someone’s chin that much?

'She really doesn’t know what true beauty is.'

South Korea is the world's largest market for plastic surgery, with one in five Seoul women having gone under the knife.

The most popular surgical procedures include double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger, lipoplasty - which uses high-frequency sound waves to eliminate fat - and nose jobs.

The popularity of surgery, particularly among the young, has been blamed by some on a desire to look more 'western' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture.

On the nonsurgical front, Botox and laser hair removal remain firm favourites, a 2012 report said.

It appears the woman in these pictures have undergone drastic jaw surgery, a high-risk operation which involves re-aligning the jaw and shaving off parts of the bone to create a 'heart shape'.

It is usually a last resort solution to correct facial deformities where people have been unable to chew properly due to an excessive over or underbite, but has become popular in South Korea.

A small face with a 'V-shaped' chin and jawline is considered a mark of feminine beauty in much of East Asia, along with a high-bridged nose and big eyes.

South Koreans have more plastic surgery than any other nation according to figures released last year.

Those in the Asian country have more treatments per members of the population, with one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle.

The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks.

While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is in fact booming.

Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife.

One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'.

It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes.

Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery.
