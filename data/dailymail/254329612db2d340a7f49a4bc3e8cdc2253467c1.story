The controversial new chairman of the Government’s historic child abuse inquiry has promised to answer critics who say she is too close to a key figure at the centre of scandal.

Fiona Woolf has for the past fortnight refused to comment on revelations by The Mail on Sunday that she has close links to former Tory grandee Leon Brittan, who is accused of failing to investigate alleged VIP paedophile rings when he was Home Secretary.

A top commercial lawyer and the Lord Mayor of London, Mrs Woolf, 66, has finally bowed to pressure to answer the growing concerns, which have been raised in Parliament.

Critics of Fiona Woolf, pictured, said she is too close to Leon Brittain who lives on the same street as her

She was challenged about her position at the Lloyd’s of London Abseil event on Friday, where she and other fundraisers descended the distinctive 289ft building in aid of charity.

Before donning her helmet and equipment, Mrs Woolf was asked whether she had declared her friendship with the Brittans to the Home Office. She confirmed: ‘I shall be making a statement.’

Mrs Woolf sits on the same City conference board as Lord Brittan and has lived in the same upmarket street as him for a decade. She also worked as a magistrate alongside his wife Lady Brittan for three years and judges a business award with her.

She has to date declined to reveal if she declared her potential conflict of interests to the Home Office.
