Millions of young women  aspire to be like Kate Moss.

The Croydon-born supermodel's wardrobe has long been the envy of almost every girl in the UK. 

But after 20 years in the spotlight, the 40-year-old has now provided a glimpse into another aspect of her life for the fairer sex to salivate over - her beautiful north London home, during an interview with British Vogue.

But while you can emulate Mossy's wardrobe with an afternoon dash around Topshop - her soft furnishings tastes will set you back much further.

Kate, 40, showed off part of her home in interview with Vogue's Kate Phelan (left).  Femail enlisted MailOnline interior design expert Celia Sawyer to value the room and it came in at just under £100,000 

We used an interior design expert to decipher how much Kate had spent on her tastefully decorated living room. 

MailOnline property blogger Celia Sawyer also runs a west London interior design company called Cool 10 Luxury Interiors and is also one of the four art dealers on the TV programme Four Rooms. 

She has been looking at the items pictured in Kate's home and estimating their worth, as well as sourcing similar pieces for those interested in acquiring The Kate Look. 

Celia has estimated the Kate's living room alone cost in the region of £100,000 when decorating, soft furnishings and furniture are all included. 

She said: 'Looking into Kate's living room, I notice that her vintage style really shows throughout her room.  

The glimpse into Kate's private life showed off the model's good taste in decor 

Celia said: 'Due to the period of the property, there is a mix of modern and traditional furniture, with contemporary velvet grey cushions, mixed with more funky retro cushions. 

'Kate seems to have opted for a neutral palate which does surprise me as I would’ve seen her going for more colour and perhaps using more of a mixture of textures. 

'If I were to cost up the entire room with a stylish solid dining table and chairs included I would say the total amount spent in this room is just a touch under £100,000.'  

Vase:  

Kate likes her flowers, and roses give off the softest perfume.A similar vase is this vintage silver vase (below left), which is around £600. 

According to design expert Celia Sawyer, Kate Moss fans keen to imitate her style could buy a similar vase at an antique store for around £600 (left) and Kate's green cup is a typical  stem mug (above centre) and costs between £8-10. Embroidered cushions like the one on her sofa can be purchased from shopping website Etsy for £35 

Mug: 

Kate has a very similar coffee mug to a 60s stem mug (pictured above centre), probably costing no more than £8-10. 

Sofa: 

The sofa looks like it is vintage and re covered, I would think with a price of around £4,000-£6,000.  

The black and white zigzag cushion in the background of Kate's living room is from Day Birger Et Mikkelsen and costs £80 

Sofa cushions:   

The cushions are a mix of velvet grey cushions which could be bought at Habitat for £25 and more decorative pillows. 

I would imagine that with Kate's image and her love of retro, vintage, she would have no problem at all at shopping in places like Ebay for these small pieces. 

Similar funky cushions like Kate's are these handmade decorative paisley cushions at Etsy £35 (top right). 

The black and white zigzag cushion in the background is from Day Birger Et Mikkelsen and costs £80 (right).  

Coffee table: 

The coffee table looks retro 60s steel and glass, probably purchased at around about £12,000.  

Curtains: 

The curtains in her living room look very good quality, and are thick lined and velvet and the fabric would be something like a velvet from Evitavone around £120 per metre.

Kate has always been a big fan of George Michael and his latest album Symphonica is on her coffee table 

George Michael DVD:  

Kate has always been a big fan of George Michael and wrote a review of his latest album Symphonica in Vogue earlier this year. 

Her first ever record was by Wham! when she was just eight years old and her love of his music style has clearly never disappeared.

On her coffee table lies a CD of the album. 

She said of the piece of work in March: 'George's ability to communicate as a performer and make you feel part of a journey is a rare gift. 

'It's an ability that defines the musical greats and, for me, it also defines what makes such a beautiful album. 

'Everyone should experience this.'

Armchair near fireplace:  

The armchair next to the fireplace looks like a modern take on a vintage chair, and the price tag of around £1200.

Table next to windows:  

This is a regency console table. It is mahogany and would cost approximately £9,000.
