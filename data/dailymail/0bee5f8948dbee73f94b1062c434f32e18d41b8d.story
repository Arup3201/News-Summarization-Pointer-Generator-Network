A Texas judge terminated parental rights this week for the biological parents of Baby Chloe, the newborn baby found in a Walmart bag in February in the parking lot of a Houston apartment complex.

Investigators had spent three months searching for the baby girl's parents but to no avail. The decision by a Harris County Juvenile Court judge on Wednesday brings the little girl one step closer to being adopted.

She is currently in the care of a foster family who would like to adopt her.

Abandoned: Child Protective Services are looking for her parents so they know her medical history

'Once the judge signs the order, then the biological parents still have up to 30 days under the law to contest the termination,' Child Protective Services spokeswoman Estella Olguin told the Houston Chronicle.

'This basically gives an opportunity for the father to come forward. It doesn't mean that the child will be returned to him, but we might be able to consider a relative.'

Chloe, who was named by hospital staff, was discovered by a dog walker abandoned outside an apartment block in the Houston suburb of Cypress on February 19.

She was born preterm and weighed 4 pounds and 12 ounces. She still had three inches of umbilical cord attached.

She was
naked, but her body temperature was normal, suggesting that she had not
been outside for a long time and someone had cleaned her up after the birth.

She was treated and named at Texas Children's Hospital before being released into foster care.

Police tried to find her parents, hoping a distinct bottom tooth would offer them a clue.

Police believe Chloe's mother did not
receive pre-natal care which is why it was difficult to track
her down.

Houston police previously released composite sketches of what Chloe's parents could look like.

The
pastel renderings created by a forensic sketch artist depict a man and a
woman with facial features combining Chloe's traits, like her grey eyes
and thick dark hair.

Investigators were unable to locate the parents.

For now, the focus is on caring for the little girl who was abandoned.

'She was very healthy… didn't have a fever,' Estella Olguin with the Child Protective Services told KHOU.

'Fortunately, she did not suffer from being exposed to the elements
that evening.'
