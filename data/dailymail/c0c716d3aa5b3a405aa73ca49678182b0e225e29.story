It seems England fans completely deserted the team for the Three Lions' meaningless Group game against Costa Rica on Tuesday.

With Roy Hodgson's men out of the World Cup, following 2-1 defeats to both Italy and Uruguay, and with nothing to play for besides pride, supporters weren't exactly keen to tune in to England's dead rubber clash.

Having packed pubs up and down the country for England's first two Group matches - when dreams of lifting the famous trophy remained intact - it appeared fans had better things to do on Tuesday evening with most squares and bars deserted.

Meanwhile, in the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte, those supporters who braved the game - after some fans had given up their tickets for a day on the beach - could be heard sarcastically chanting 'England's coming home!'.

A number of England's star names who started the tournament in the first team, including Wayne Rooney and captain Steven Gerrard were left out on the bench while Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw were given their first World Cup starts.
