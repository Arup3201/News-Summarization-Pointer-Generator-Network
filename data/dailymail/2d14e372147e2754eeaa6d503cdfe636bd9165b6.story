John Quinn became one of a select band of trainers to record a Group One victory on the flat and a Grade One success over jumps when The Wow Signal maintained his unbeaten record in the Prix Morny at Deauville yesterday.

Quinn, who won the Triumph Hurdle in 2012 with Countrywide Flame, was on hand to see Frankie Dettori instigate a Group One double aboard the winner who stepped up on his Coventry Stakes triumph to repel fellow Royal Ascot scorer Hootenanny by half a length.

The Wow Signal, now unbeaten in three starts, will be stepped up in trip to seven furlongs for his next assignment according to the ecstatic winning trainer.

Success: The Wow Signal won the Prix Morny at Deauville and has ridden to victory in it's three outings

Quinn said: 'He's crying out for seven furlongs and I would say it will either be the Dewhurst or the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere for him next.

'We're delighted. It's a great day. I wouldn't say this is what we do it for, but these are the days you dream of.

'Everyone works hard and you hope you might come across a horse like him. We're thrilled to have our piece of it.' Dettori completed his Group One brace when the James Fanshawe-trained Ribbons produced a fine turn of foot to land the Darley Prix Jean Romanet from fellow British raiders Princess Loulou and Secret Gesture who filled the places.

Fanshawe, who coincidentally is also a member of the Group One/Grade One winning club, felt the Prix de L'Opera at Longchamp on Arc de Triomphe weekend would be a logical step for Ribbons.

'I asked Frankie about moving up in trip but his advice was to stay at a mile and a quarter as he thinks she just has that turn of foot.'  Roger Varian is eyeing a step up in trip to seven furlongs for Lowther Stakes runner-up Cursory Glance, with either the Moyglare Staks or the Rockfel Stakes the preferred options.
