As one viewer put it, the BBC should have renamed Jamaica Inn, its latest big-budget period drama, ‘The Unintelligible Arms’.

For hundreds who stayed in to watch it on Easter Monday night – including several actors – struggled to understand what was being said.  

The BBC has received more than 100 complaints over the adaptation of the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, while more than a million viewers switched off during the programme.

Complaints: Viewers claimed they struggled to hear the first episode of BBC period drama Jamaica Inn when it aired on Monday evening

Bosses
 blamed technical issues  – but audience members put it down to the 
actors’ thick Cornish accents. They reported having to switch on 
subtitles or turn up the volume to the maximum setting to understand the
 dialogue.

The drama, set 
in 1821 against the bleak Cornish moors, follows Mary Yellan, played by 
Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay, who is forced to live with her
 aunt and smuggler uncle when her mother dies.

Not
 that viewers were any the wiser. Comedian Al Murray vented his 
frustration on Twitter, writing: ‘Find out what happens next in Jamaica 
Inn by getting your ears syringed!’

John
 Challis, best known for playing Boycie in Only Fools And Horses, said 
he hadn’t heard a single word, while former Strictly Come Dancing judge 
Arlene Phillips asked her followers whether anyone else was having 
trouble with the sound.

Viewer
 Alun Rees tweeted: ‘Jamaica Inn. The Unintelligible Arms more like. 
Rule 1. Speak the lines clearly. Even with a Cornish accent.’ Emma 
Frost, who wrote the screenplay for the adaptation, suggested that a 
technical fault, rather than the way that the cast delivered the lines, 
was to blame.

She said: 
‘There was no problem on the version I saw, but tonight I couldn’t hear.
 The director and executives were on the phone to the BBC from the off 
yelling, “Why can’t we hear it?” Too late I fear. None of the production
 team know what happened with the sound. It was fine before.’

Philippa
 Lowthorpe, who directed the drama and recently won a Bafta award for 
Call the Midwife, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘I think there was a sound 
issue ... I don’t think anybody’s actually got down to the bottom of why
 it happened.

‘My mum and dad live in the North and they didn’t have a problem. So I don’t know if it was around the country or in some areas.

‘When
 we are dubbing, we always listen to it back on quite an old-fashioned 
ordinary telly. I suppose you can’t do everything for the vagaries of 
everybody’s telly.’

In an 
apology, the BBC blamed ‘issues with sound levels’, and said that 
although they could not be altered while the drama was on air, the 
dialogue was adjusted for last night’s second episode and the third 
which airs tonight.

Initially
 the drama attracted an audience of 6.8million. By the end, it had 
fallen to 5.7million, bringing the average audience down to 6.1million.

Last year viewers of BBC drama Ripper Street were left similarly frustrated, complaining of ‘muffled’ lines in one episode.

The
 latest complaints come almost a year after BBC director-general Tony 
Hall suggested bosses should look at how to stop actors ‘muttering’ in 
dramas.

He also said that the BBC was addressing the issue of background
 music, which some viewers say drowns out dialogue.
