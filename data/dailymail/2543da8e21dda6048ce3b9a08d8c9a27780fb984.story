A woman whose residence stands both in New York and Connecticut lost half of her home to her neighbor, a spiritual life coach, all because her mortgage servicer didn't pay her New York property taxes.

Roseanne Di Giulio's neighbor Althea Jacob, a self-proclaimed medium, clairvoyant, and healer bought half her land unbeknownst to Giulio for $275 and says she'll only return it for $35,000.

Giulio's home has an address in Brewster, New York and New Fairfield, Connecticut and after having her home refinanced a few years ago her bank failed to pay the $200 annual property tax for the New York portion of her property thereby forfeiting her ownership of the land.

KHOU reports that it wasn't until Roseanne Di Giulio decided that she wanted to build a shed near the property line with her neighbor that she became aware of the sale.

'They told me I no longer owned my land,' Di Giulio recalled.

'I was like, 'What do you mean I don't own that property? I've owned this property since 1997.'

CBS reports that no one is trying to evict Giulio and her neighbor apparently wants the yard and not the house but Giulio has been paying her homeowner's insurance and the upkeep of her neighbor's property without even knowing it no longer belonged to her.

Jacob's lawyer Robert Karlsson said that a sign posted on a tree reading 'property sale' led his client to buy the land and that she had no motives other than to acquire more land legally.

'There was a yellow sign posted on the tree announcing a real-estate sale, and she decided she wanted to snap it up,' Karlsson said.

'Who wouldn't want to make their property larger? She bid on the property, and to her delight, there she goes — she has a larger property.'

Two state solution?:  The tax confusion began when Giulio refinanced her mortgage in 2004 and continued through a second refinance in 2006 but her bank didn't pay her New York property taxes 

When Giulio asked for her land back Jacob said she could buy it for $150,000 but later lowered her asking price to $35,000.

'I'm just an average person living my life,' said Di Giulio, an electrical contractor.

'My neighbor is an opportunist. She was looking for something for nothing.' 

Giulio says she received no notice that her taxes weren't being paid and  feels as though she has been victimized.

KHOU reports that the tax confusion began when Di Giulio refinanced her mortgage in 2004 and continued through a second refinance in 2006.

Giulio used to pay only her Connecticut property taxes via an escrow account and wrote a check to Patterson, New York for the land.

In 2004, JP Morgan Chase officials told her they also needed to put money for the New York taxes into the escrow account.

Two taxes: Giulio's home has an address in Brewster, New York and New Fairfield, Connecticut and after having her home refinanced a few years ago her bank failed to pay the $200 annual property tax

However, the bank never paid the bill and it sold the loan in 2010 to Seterus Inc.

New York State law says that a property owner must be notified by mail if there will be a foreclosure.

Giulio only receives mail at her Connecticut address and her New York mailbox is sealed which may explain why she didn't receive the notice.

Giulio's lawyer Michael Caruso says that if mailing a letter to the resident fails, the postmaster must ask for an alternate address or publish the foreclosure in a public place like a newspaper or county clerk's office.

Giulio wants to overturn her foreclosure case in front of Supreme Court Justice Victor Grossman but because she didn't bring action within the two year statute of limitations it’s problematic.

In  talks before the court date, Di Giulio said she was aghast by her neighbor's initial demand of $150,000, now down to $35,000.

Jacob's lawyer said the mortgage company would make the payment not Giulio, but Di Giulio hasn't accepted the settlement yet.

'I feel like I was the one who was damaged and victimized,' she said. 

'I don't think it's fair that my neighbor should profit.'

Because Giulio  didn't bring action within the two year statute of limitations (because she didn't know it was sold) the case could be problematic

Althea Jacob says she only wants Giulio's yard and says the mortgage company would pay $35,000, not Giulio

Giulio still thinks it's 'unfair' that her neighbor will profit while she is 'victimized'
