A Florida man convicted of grand theft for wooing investors out of $1 million through a sham record company was a 'vampire' who targeted women whose money he take and take until there was nothing left, his victims say. 

Scott Campbell, 49, netted a cool mil over 10 years from the scheme. A jury convicted Campbell of first-degree grand theft after a week-long trial.

Now his penniless victims--which all told numbered as many as 30--have spoken out about the wreckage the scheming womanizer has left in his wake.

Con man: Scott Campbell, 49, netted a cool mil over 10 years BY scheming women out of money by telling them he was a musical producer who could get them big returns

Prosecutors said Campbell used dating and social media websites to find female investors under the guise that he was interested in dating them.

He would tell his potential investors that he was starting a record company that he would use to find new talent.

It was all part of a countrywide contest and tour he called Give Me a Chance, an initiative of his fictional BDO record company.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, he his potential investors, all of whom were women, 'it was going to be bigger than American Idol or The Voice.' 

Prosecutors say Campbell used the money to support his lifestyle, not a business.

An ex girlfriend, who once got a restraining order against Campbell, agrees.

'Scott's like a vampire,' Jeannie Thompson, who dated Campbell for eight years. 'He would take all your personal finances. He would do that until he would literally suck everything out of you.'

'Vampire': Jeannie Thompson once dated Campbell and called him 'a vampire' who 'would take all your personal finances.' One of his victims, Kim Serravalle (right) mortgaged her home in order to give Campbell $70,000

Thompson said her former man 'looked for women with very low self-esteem' and went in for the kill.

According to authorities Campbell managed to drain a shocking $300,000 from one Georgia victim he met online.

Another woman named Kim Serravalle said Campbell wouldn't stop persisting until he got what he want from her.

Serravalle said she often gave him what he wanted because she was frightened of Campbell. Now she's paying dearly.

The 55-year-old Orlando woman went as far as to mortgage her home for Campbell, leaving her $70,000 poorer when the 'returns' Thompson claimed she'd get from his business never came.

'I'm going to be paying until I'm 80,' she told the Sentinel. 

While the dozens of women Thompson victimized are unlikely to ever recover the many thousands they handed over to him, the scam artist will soon pay for his crimes. 

He faces up to 30 years in prison when he is sentenced in February.
