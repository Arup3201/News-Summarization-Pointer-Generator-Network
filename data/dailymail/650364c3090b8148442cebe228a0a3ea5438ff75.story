Georgia Salpa has never been shy when it comes to showing some skin but today the Irish model is at least showing off her body for a good cause

Georgia is the latest star to model small pink lingerie in aid of Breast Cancer Awareness month.

The 29-year-old Irish model and reality star has been photographed in a limited edition set from Alexis Smith underwear created to raise money for the charity Against Breast Cancer during October.

Georgia, who has a 30F bra size, was made the face of Alexis Smith lingerie in May this year

Alexis Smith, the woman behind the lingerie says that she is thrilled to be helping the charity once again. 

'It's great to be working with the Against Breast Cancer charity again. We have worked with them in the past and wanted to support them again this year throughout Breast Cancer Awareness month. 

'25% of all sales from our limited edition pink satin set will be donated to the charity throughout the month of October. I hope that sales of the limited edition pink set will help raise vital funds for the charity that carries out pioneering research at the University of Westminster in London.' 

Launched in 2010, the Alexis Smith brand caters for women with big busts and small frames, like 30F cup Georgia, who was signed as the new face of the brand in May 2014 . 

Georgia isn't the only woman to be dressing down to raise awareness, Kate Moss has also been doing her bit for charity. 

For every set sold, Alexis Smith will donate 25% of the profits to the Against Breast Cancer charity

The 40-year-old model was happy to use her posing skills for a good cause as she has teamed up with Stella McCartney for a cheeky studio shoot.

The British model posed in the British designer's specially designed lingerie with just a strategically placed BCA ribbon to save her blushes. 

Stella McCartney has designed the special Gemma Relaxing range in neon pink as part of the Autumn/Winter 14 Lingerie Collection.

A percentage of the profits from the worldwide sales of the range will be donated to the Linda McCartney Centre in Liverpool, UK. The proceeds will help fund a new mammography suite at the centre, to offer breast cancer patients the best prospects for early diagnosis, treatment and recovery. 

The inspiration behind the project was to raise awareness around the disease through creating a set that reminds women to keep healthy.

On Kate's involvement in the campaign Stella McCartney commented: 'Kate is a strong feminine woman with a daughter and a husband; a strong family unit. For her it was important to bring awareness to this campaign to keep families together.

'Women are an integral part of the family unit, they keep and hold families together and are a source of strength'

Stella McCartney explained: 'I wanted to remind women that when they wear this set, the first thing they put on in the morning, to keep on top of their health and visit their doctor regularly.

She added: 'I wanted it to be the initial starting point of awareness of this terrible illness. Not only does the set serve as a healthy reminder, but it looks great, fits incredibly well, and is comfortable and stylish'. 

Kate Moss was happy to use her posing skills for a good cause too as she teamed up with Stella McCartney for Breast Cancer Awareness month

The Alexis Smith limited edition pink satin lingerie set is available for £30 from www.alexissmith.eu – 25% of all sales from this set during October 2014 go to the charity Against Breast Cancer 

The Gemma Relaxing Collection will be available online at stellamccartney.com, in Stella McCartney stores and select department and specialty stores worldwide.

The Linda McCartney Centre (part of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital), was established in 2000 to provide a comfortable and welcoming environment for Breast Cancer patients and their families.
