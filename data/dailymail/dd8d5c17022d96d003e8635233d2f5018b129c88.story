As the sea view from Bryony Nierop-Reading's bungalow got ever closer she adamantly refused to leave.

One-by-one her neighbours moved out as the pounding waves eroded the cliffs below their homes.

But the 68-year-old, affectionately nicknamed Grandmother King Canute because she seemed to think she could stop the tide, said no.

Today though, after five years in her home, Mrs Nierop-Reading had to finally give in as last week's surge tide left the three-bedroom bungalow overhanging the 80ft cliff.

Sad day: Bryony Nierop-Reading's cliff-top bungalow has been demolished today after it was left on the edge of a north Norfolk cliff after the storm surge last week

On the edge: The grandmother has lived in the home since 2008 and has even turned down large sums so she could stay as long as possible

Message: The resident was known affectionately as Queen Canute as she believed she could turn the tide, but today she has seen it demolished as it slipped towards the North Sea

A decade in the making: This photograph taken in 2003 shows how the bungalow then enjoyed a decent sized garden to the cliff edge. 10 years on it had all gone through erosion

She watched in sadness as her seaside home where she had hoped to live for several more years was demolished.

Mrs Nierop-Reading bought her home with idyllic views of the North Sea for £25,000 when it was 20ft from the edge in 2008.

As the sea approached ever closer she was offered £53,000 under a Government compensation scheme to leave, but she refused.

The end came today though after the highest surge tide for 60 years tore away huge chunks of the cliff at Happisburgh near North Walsham, Norfolk, washing away part of the property's foundations.

The lean-to extension of her 1930s bungalow containing her bathroom, toilet, pantry and part of her bedroom was left hanging over the edge and at risk of toppling over at any minute.

Compromise: Mrs Nierop-Reading admits she was offered more than £50,000 to leave but said she could not be without her £1million view

Huge damage: Coastal erosion has brought Bryony Nierop-Reading's cliff-top bungalow closer to the waves on Happisburgh beach 20 years earlier than expected, and has been broken up by the local council

Mrs Nierop-Reading, a former maths teacher and owner of a tractor repair business, carried away the bulk of her possessions before demolition workers moved in. She has now moved into a nearby mobile home also on the cliff-top.

As she surveyed the remains of her bungalow today, she said: 'I don’t regret buying this place as I have had five years of sheer pleasure living here.

All change: This was the view in 2008, where Bryony Nierop-Reading's bungalow was in the middle of this row of houses. Today it was on the edge

'It has been like being on holiday every day of the year, waking up to a fantastic view over the sea and watching the sun rise over the water.

'Only last summer, I was string in my garden with a glass of wine and a fantastic view. I just love the way that the sea and the sky constantly change colour. It is a constantly moving landscape.' Mrs Nierop-Reading who has seven grandchildren said she did not regret losing out on a £13,000 offer of compensation after she refused to move out in 2009.

She could have got an extra £40,000 by selling a planning consent which would have enabled her to build a replacement home inland as part of the compensation package.

The owners of ten other homes on the clifftop all accepted the compensation offer, leaving Mrs Nierop-Reading as the only remaining resident.

She said: 'People say "You threw away £53,000", but I just reply: "Look at the million pound view I have had for the past five years." 'It has been magical living on the edge of a clifftop – the sea, the skies, the gulls – and I’m just jolly grateful. I have been incredibly happy here for the last five years.

'I have loved every minute of it. I bought the house knowing that it was going to go one day and I’ve got no regrets, although I had hoped to stay a lot longer.' Mrs Nierop-Reading said she had moved out of the main bedroom of her bungalow three-weeks-ago as a precaution and started sleeping in another bedroom further away from the cliff.

She decided to stay in her mobile home on the night of the surge tide because she knew her home would be in danger.

Mrs Nierop-Reading said: 'When the tide came, it was absolutely terrifying. Waves were smashing into the cliff and water was spraying 20ft into the air. I had never seen anything like it.

'When I saw the damage I realised I could never go back. Friends and neighbours have helped me move out most of my things over the last few days.

'I managed to salvage almost everything of value apart from my jewellery which was left on a shelf in the bedroom which was hanging over the edge.

'I couldn’t risk going back in there to get it as it was too dangerous and now it is somewhere in the wreckage which went over the cliff.

Frightening: Demolition workers were forced to come in today after it became too dangerous for its owner to be inside

Crushed: The home was flattened today after the tidal surge last Thursday, which was higher than levels recorded in the 1953 floods that devastated East Anglia

'I just consider myself fortunate that I was able to get nearly everything out.I am luckier than the people in Walcott and Hemsby who lost everything.' Mrs Nierop-Reading who separated from her husband in 2000 added: 'It is an incredibly sad day, seeing my home demolished. I have been so busy that I have not had time to shed a tear.

'But I've said goodbye to the house and later when I'm less busy I'll find a quiet corner and howl my eyes out. Meanwhile, we're British aren't we so I'll keep a stiff upper lip.' King Canute, who ruled England between 995 and 1035, is often said to have tried to turn back the tide – but failed as the waves began lapping around his feet.

But historians say this is just a myth and, in fact, the Saxon monarch was really trying to show to courtiers that despite his powers he wasn’t great enough to stop the sea.

Caravans were left balancing on the edge of a cliff after the storm swept the UK.

The
surge, which flooded areas of Hull, including Victoria Dock and 
Ferensway, and led to mass evacuations along the coast, caused damage 
expected to cost millions of pounds to repair.

The owner of the 
caravan, in Ulrome, near Bridlington, East Yorkshire, was not inside at 
the time, but her friend Tony Pountney could scarcely believe the 
carnage that confronted him when he went to check the site.

Mr Pountney said: 'The weather took down a massive retaining wall at the front and damaged two or three caravans.'

Precarious: These caravans were left teetering on the edge of a cliff in East Yorkshire after the storm and tidal surge that lashed the UK
