A woman allegedly raped by disgraced former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall (pictured) told a court today she is haunted by a recurring nightmare of the attack

A woman allegedly raped by disgraced former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall between the ages of 12 and 15 is haunted by a recurring nightmare of his attacks, a jury heard.

The woman told Preston Crown Court she suffered from terrifying dreams about the attack based on the memory of what happened to her.

She denied the prosecution's claims the memory was 'a dream' - saying 'It absolutely categorically happened.'

The woman later compared her experiences to 
that of Jodie Foster, who played a gang rape victim in the film The 
Accused, the court heard.

The
 woman, referred to as Girl B, told a therapist: 'I remember watching 
The Accused... I threw up with the violence. Her pleading for it to 
stop. That has stayed with me.'

Hall, who was in his 40s at the time, was said to have forced his tongue in her mouth and repeatedly told her 'You’re special' as he raped her.

Hall has already pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting her when she was 13.

The former It’s A Knockout presenter 
claims, despite that assault, he went on to have a consensual sexual 
relationship with her in the years that followed.

The alleged victim's mother convinced her
 daughter to stay silent - fearing her father might 'kill' the Hall in 
revenge, the court was told today.

Hall, 84, has pleaded not guilty to 20 allegations of rape and indecent assault between 1976 and 1981 against two young girls.

He
 was jailed last year after he pleaded guilty to 14 offences of indecent
 assault against 13 different girls, aged nine to 17, at the same court 
and was jailed for 15 months, subsequently increased to 30 months at the
 Court of Appeal.

The trial continues.

The court has heard how the alleged victim was working at a stables at the age of 12 when the TV celebrity - a family friend - turned up unannounced on a motorbike.

He took her to a corner of the stables, pushed her up against the wall and then raped her, she said.

Crispin Aylett QC, defending Hall, asked her: 'Might you have seen the defendant arrive on a motorcycle and what you are telling us about it now is something that has come to you in a dream?'

She replied: 'You are completely incorrect. It is a memory that I dream about and a very, very vivid memory.'

Mr Aylett said: 'This incident didn’t happen at all.'

She said: 'It absolutely categorically happened.'

Explaining the dreams, she said: 'It’s a recurring dream I have had all my life. In fact, I would change that word to nightmare.

'It’s a memory that haunts me. It wakes me up and it has done many times.'

Mr Aylett said: “'here are times when you dream things that have never happened.'

She replied: 'I think, if this had happened to you, you know it would have happened.'

Hall, pictured outside court for a previous hearing, is alleged to have attacked Girl B - telling her she was 'special' as he raped her. The alleged victim categorically denied in court today the attack was a dream

Girl B became interested in a career in television and Hall invited her to his then workplace at the BBC studios in Manchester’s Piccadilly.

She later visited another studio at Oxford Road in the city.

Hall is said to have raped her at both locations.

Mr Aylett asked the complainant: 'Did you ever say to the defendant ‘I would rather not have sex today’?'

She said: 'No, it was not a relationship. I did not have a choice. I was not asked. I was not invited to comment.'

The barrister went on: 'Did you ever do anything or say anything to indicate that you did not want to have sex?'

Girl B replied: 'I didn’t want it to happen. It did happen. I felt guilty. I felt responsible. I felt it was my fault.'

She conceded that he did not frighten her and was charming. He would tell her that he loved her and how special she was, she said.

Mr Aylett said: 'Did you not rather like that?'

She said: 'No, absolutely not then. It was hideous.'

Mr Aylett said: 'Or now?'

She said: 'The whole thing was extremely unpleasant. At that age and at that time you have to get through it the best way you can.

'I made that choice. I did not spend time thinking about anything else apart from just getting on with it and, frankly, surviving it.'

She added: 'I would say he was very successful at getting what he wanted.'

She said she did not specifically ask to go to the BBC.

Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard how the alleged victim's mother persuaded her to stay quiet about the attack - saying her father would 'kill' Hall if he found out

The court heard that she told the police 'everyone at the BBC looked up to him (Hall)'.

She said the usual pattern of behaviour from Hall was that they would drink champagne in between him going on screen - him drinking the best part of a bottle.

She said: 'Stuart drank a lot. The best part of a bottle of champagne would be a glass for most people.'

The court heard that Hall and the complainant went on to have intercourse at a flat.

Mr Aylett asked her if it was the case that they 'made love' there rather than at the BBC when it was 'more hurried'.

Girl B replied: 'Made love is just insulting... it was not a relationship. We did not ever make love. Certainly not from my side.'

The jury was told that Hall and the complainant had discussed their sexual contact after it emerged that the defendant had abused other young girls.

She said: 'He said "You are different, it was not the same with any of the others" and I was "special".

'I said "But you have done this to these girls".'

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, asked the witness: 'At any time, has he (Hall) ever apologised to you?”

She replie he had not.

Hall, 84, has pleaded not guilty to 20 allegations of rape and indecent assault between 1976 and 1981 against two young girls. The trial continues

Mr Wright continued: 'At the time when there has been any discussion between you in terms of what he had done, what was his reaction or demeanour?'

She said: 'In recent times, remorseless.'

Earlier, Mr Aylett asked the complainant if she intended to make a claim for compensation in relation to Hall’s admitted indecent assault on her.

She replied: 'I have given absolutely no thought to making a compensation claim. Getting through this is my first thought.'

Mr Aylett said: 'You are not ruling it out?'

The witness said: 'I am not ruling it in. I don’t know what the process is.'

Mr Aylett repeated: 'You are not ruling it out?'

She replied: 'I find it very insulting at this moment in time to answer that question.

'It has taken an awful long time to choose to do this.'

One of Hall’s 13 victims whom he admitted indecently assaulting last year was next to give evidence. She had been a friend of Girl B in their childhood.

It is said she was abused on the same occasion at a dinner party when Hall indecently assaulted Girl B when she was aged 13.

The woman, now in her late 40s, was 'stunned' and 'helpless' when Hall targeted her in a bath.

As he abused her, he would say 'You’re beautiful and gorgeous' over and over again, the court heard. She said she confided in Girl B the next morning.

She told the court: 'I told her what had happened to me and she told me he had gone into her room and did things to her.'

She said the victim's mother told her not to tell anyone about the alleged attack in fear of what her husband might do to Stuart.

The woman, who cannot be named, said she, Girl B and another teenager found a bottle of Martini, got drunk and ended up being sick.

She said: 'I was undressed by Girl B's mum but she left the bathroom and Stuart lifted me into the bath.

'He then touched me intimately more than once with his finger and also touched my breasts.

'He lifted me out of the bath and into a towel on the floor and proceeded to touch me again in an intimate part of my body.

'I was shocked, stunned and paralysed by his conduct. I was feeling helpless by it. He told me I was beautiful and gorgeous and kissed me on the lips.'

The jury heard that when Girl B's mother returned to the bathroom she asked why the door was locked and Hall let her in to finish dressing her.

The next day she told Girl B what Hall did - and Girl B then told her how Hall had also indecently assaulted her as she lay drunk in bed.

But when they both told Girl B's mum, she urged them to keep it to themselves fearing her husband's reaction if he found out what Hall did.

The witness added: 'We spoke to her (Girl B's) mother the next day but she was concerned that we didn't say anything in case it caused trouble and in case Girl B's father killed Stuart.'
