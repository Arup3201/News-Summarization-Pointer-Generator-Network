A Colorado man is in critical condition after jumping out of his van to avoid being burned by a lit cigarette he dropped and was run over by his own car, authorities say. 

It was around 6.30am Sunday when the unnamed man began backing out of his drive way and dropped his lit cigarette down the front of his jacket, USA Today reports.

In a panic, the man jumped from the vehicle, as the van kept rolling backward, and fell to the ground.

Today reports that the front, left wheel ran over the man's head causing him to suffer life-threatening injuries.

He was taken to a local hospital where he was listed in critical condition. 

A relative was in the car with him at the time of the accident but was not hurt, the Huffington Post reports.

Authorities say that Alcohol was not a suspected factor in the accident. 

Police say that though the man is in critical condition, it is likely that he will survive.
