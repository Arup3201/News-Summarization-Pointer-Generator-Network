Apple has revealed the world's thinnest laptop that experts say could pave the way for an 'iPad Mega' later this year.

The new machine, called simply the MacBook, boasts a 12 inch screen and a full size keyboard - but is just 13.1 mm thin and weighs two pounds.

It also boasts a radical new port, called USB-C, that allows it to use a single connector for power, and to hook up to other devices and even a TV.

Apple has revealed  world's thinnest laptop that experts say could pave the way for an 'iPad Mega' this year

Measuring 13.1 mm at its thickest point, the new MacBook design is 24 per cent thinner than the 11-inch MacBook Air.

It has a 12-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, measuring 0.88 mm thin and a resolution of 2304 x 1440

Its trackpad features built-in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere with haptic feedback.

The design is the most compact logic board ever in a Mac, measuring 67 per cent smaller than the 11-inch MacBook Air.

It is the first fanless Mac notebook for silent, efficient performance.

MacBook also has several hours of wireless web browsing and up to 10 hours of iTunes movie playback.

Experts say the machine blurs the line between the iPad, iPhone and Macbook range.

'It seems more iPad than Mac, and joins the two ranges together,' said Stuart Miles of Pocket-Lint.com.

'It is also easy to see where the rumours of the iPad Pro came in. It's very easy to see how this could be turned into a large iPad, with a removable keyboard.'

Apple's Phil Schiller boasted the firm had 'reinvented every technology in it.'

For instance, Apple has redesigned the keyboard. claiming it is four times more accurate.

There is an LED under every key, so the entire keyboard has a uniform glow and can be used in the dark.

There is a new, pressure-sensitive Force Touch trackpad too so users can fast forward a film by applying more pressure.

The MacBook has the same 'taptic engine' as the Apple Watch, uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and is the first fanless logic board. This makes the components 67 per cent smaller.

Ian Fogg, an analyst with IHS, told MailOnline 'What Apple is doing here is following its visa for the Mac, its adding in the best features form the iPhone and iPad, and making it thinner and lighter.

'They've also kept course on not putting a touchscreen in there, and innovation with the touchpad

'The opportunity for Apple with the Macbook is to grow the Mac at the expense of competitors.

The firm has also struck every component - the main logic board is 67 per cent smaller than in previous MacBook Air, allowing more batteries to be installed in the case, for instance.

Measuring just 13.1 mm at its thickest point, the new MacBook design is an amazing 24 percent thinner than the 11-inch MacBook Air.

Batteries were created in sheets to fit the inside of the machine perfectly.

The notebook comes in silver, space grey and gold, starts at $1,299 for 8GB memory and will ship from 10 April. The price starts at £1,049 in the UK.

'Apple has reinvented the notebook with the new MacBook, and at just two pounds and 13.1 mm, it's the thinnest and lightest Mac ever,' said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.

'Every component of the MacBook reveals a new innovation.

'From its fanless design, ultra-thin Retina display and full-size keyboard that's 34 percent thinner, to its all-new Force Touch trackpad, versatile USB-C port and breakthrough terraced battery design, the new MacBook is the future of the notebook.'
