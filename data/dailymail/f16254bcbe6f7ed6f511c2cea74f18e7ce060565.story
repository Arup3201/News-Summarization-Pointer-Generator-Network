When the tendrils of a neighbour’s clematis started creeping into his garden, Stanley George decided to give it a trim.

After climbing a step ladder, he said he carefully snipped off a 4in section of the hedge – knowing it was his neighbour’s pride and joy.

So he was ‘gobsmacked’ when the 45ft-long plant slowly folded over and collapsed into a large heap on the ground.

Now, the secateur-wielding pensioner has ended up with a criminal record at the age of 86 after magistrates decided he and a fellow octogenarian ‘accomplice’ had cut down the clematis on purpose.

The row has shattered the tranquillity of the smart bungalows in the seaside town of Prestatyn, North Wales. A court heard George’s green-fingered neighbour, Rhona Parker, 76, had an immaculate garden with honeysuckle and climbing roses.

But the crowning feature was the clematis. Planted to celebrate the birth of her youngest grandchild, it had grown for 18 years on a wall adjoining George’s property.

But after taking exception to the ever-expanding plant, he and another neighbour, Claire Condy, 81, took matters into their own hands. First, they removed several plastic ties attached to it.

Then George used his secateurs to snip off the 4in section. ‘To my astonishment, the clematis wobbled a bit then folded up and descended very slowly,’ said Condy, a retired teacher. ‘It curled downwards until it all collapsed.’

The owner of the clematis, Mrs Parker, told Llandudno magistrates she came home on June 18 to find Condy standing on an aluminium ladder while leaning over the fence and cutting her plants.

‘I asked her to stop and she told me to get back in and shut my cakehole. The whole length was being cut away, she was just telling Mr George what to do when he was on another ladder.’

As she watched in horror, the clematis slowly collapsed. Police were called and found Mrs Parker ‘crying, shaking and very upset’.

Philip Wilson, a gardener who examined the damage, said: ‘All the plants had been cut in many places, mainly evergreen clematis but others such as roses which had grown into the clematis.’

However, George blamed Mrs Parker’s gardening skills, saying: ‘The whole cause of this was that proper clematis frames had not been put in.’

Alex Fitzgerald, defending, told the court George and Condy thought the plant would be supported, even though the ties had been cut.

‘Accidents do happen,’ he said. ‘But is it a criminal offence? Stupidity or lack of imagination should not lead to conviction. At this stage of their lives their primary concern will be the loss of their good character.’

But chairman of the bench Peter Hughes said: ‘We find the prosecution evidence was compelling and the damage was deliberate.’

George and Condy were found guilty of criminal damage, given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay a total of £808 compensation to their neighbour as well as court costs. After the day-long trial, Mrs Parker smiled and said: ‘I’m just relieved it’s all over.’
