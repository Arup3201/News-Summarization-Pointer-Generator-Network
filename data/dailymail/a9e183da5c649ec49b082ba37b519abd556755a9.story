Great British Menu judge Prue Leith has blamed TV chefs for making Britons a nation of couch potatoes

She is the doyenne of the culinary world with more than 50 years’ experience in the kitchen.

Great British Menu judge Prue Leith, 74, was running her own catering company at 20, ran the respected Leiths School of Food and Wine for nearly two decades and has published 12 cookbooks.

But woe betide any chefs who try to impress her with food which is too clever for its own good. Miss Leith criticised molecular gastronomy chefs for trying to show off with clever techniques which added nothing to the flavour of dishes.

And she complained the culture of celebrity chefs was breeding a generation who watch cookery shows 'while stuffing their faces with pizza, Pot Noodles and chocolate bars.'

Speaking at the Festival of Literature in Dubai last weekend, the Cordon Bleu-trained septuagenarian said: 'The trouble with all these fashions is that every second chef who is half good thinks they can do it too.

'It tends to be dominated by machinery they have got in the kitchen rather than the quality of the ingredients or what things go together.

'You get too many flavours because something has been dehydrated and pulverised until it is a sort of sand or powder, or something has been dropped into a calcium bath to make it into little balls like caviar. Then there is a lump of meat that has been in a water bath for a long time…by the time they have done all that, where is the flavour?'

Miss Leith also railed against 'ridiculous' celebrity culture, which she blamed for warping children’s aspirations.

When she goes into schools and even catering colleges, pupils are only interested in TV cooks like Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay because they are famous rather than because they can cook.

'It is the wrong thing for children to aspire to,' said Miss Leith. 'Some of these TV chefs do not have any restaurants at all.

'It is just performance, which is fine, but when food came out of the BBC education [department], it was all rather solemn.

'No one cooks from celebrity chefs at all because it has nothing to do with cooking, it is just entertainment.

'They buy their books, which lie on coffee tables untouched. They watch the shows because the average adult in England watches five hours of TV a day and it just happens to be cheap telly.

'It is heartbreaking that we see these chefs doing beautiful things with wonderful ingredients while they are sitting on sofas stuffing their faces with pizza, Pot Noodles and chocolate bars.'

The chef said schoolteachers were to blame for feeding a hunger for celebrity culture rather than educating children about food and cited one incident when she visited a school, only to be treated 'like Angelina Jolie' because the children had been primed to believe a star was coming.

Chefs, she added, had become 'obsessed' with equipment and tricks at the cost of producing quality flavours.

'I would never say they have no place, it is just there is too much of a fashion,' she said.

'I am very happy to eat foam on top of a cappuccino because it is quite pleasant but the trouble with foam on most dishes is that it rapidly becomes scum so what started off looking like wonderful foamy rocks of seafood turns into some swimming pool you would not want to go near.'

Miss Leith said she was a fan of Heston Blumenthal, describing him as an 'absolute genius'. When molecular gastronomy was done well, she added, it could enhance rather than detract from the flavour of dishes.

Waiters who take too much time to describe food also came in the line of fire from the outspoken chef, who has just finished recording the ninth series of Great British Menu, which will be screened on the BBC later this year.

Miss Leith described a business lunch at Story restaurant in London, where diners were inflicted with a minimum of 10 courses, each accompanied by a lengthy description from the waiter.

'The waiter comes along and tells you a story for every mouthful you eat - and there are 10 courses so it takes forever,' she said.

What to do if you can’t find an item in the shops? For Nigella Lawson the answer was simple – turn to Twitter.

The celebrity chef tweeted Waitrose to demand: ‘Why does nobody sell  brioche burger buns?’

M&S jumped in to reply: ‘M&S is launching brioche burger AND hotdog buns. Would you like an advance sample?’ And Sainsbury’s PR added: ‘Our Taste the Difference Brioche

Burger Buns will be in stores next week!’ Miss Lawson, who has more than 500,000 followers, posted: ‘Let them eat brioche’, while other users called the storm in a teacup ‘briochegate’.

'All the food was delicious and it is fascinating stuff but this is a City restaurant. [My companion] had to leave before the pudding and I thought: "This is not quite right." They should serve a warning that it is a restaurant for foodies only.'

Miss Leith was born in South Africa but spent her adult life in the UK. She launched her catering company in 1960, opened her Michelin starred restaurant Leith’s at the age of 29 and started her cookery school six years later.

She was chairwoman of the School Food Trust for four years until 2010, a government quango set up to make school dinners healthier.

She said she resented Jamie Oliver at first for bringing the issue to a head but was soon won over by his earnestness and dedication: 'My first reaction, I am ashamed to say, was: ‘My God, I have been banging on about this for 40 years and so have most of the cooks I know and people who are interested in education.

'We have all been to see the department a hundred times, we have lobbied and done our bit and along comes this whippersnapper, snaps his fingers and Tony Blair gives him lots of money.

'But that is the power of television and the power of Jamie, because he is really amazing and engaging. He has been terrific.'
