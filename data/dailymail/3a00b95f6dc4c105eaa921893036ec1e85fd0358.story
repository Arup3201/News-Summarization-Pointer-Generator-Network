A deaf woman claims she was ridiculed by post office staff who told her to ‘get an interpreter’ before asking her to leave the building.

The 38-year-old was showing her eight-year-old son how to ship a package during a visit to the Port Orange Post Office in Volusia County, Florida.

But after explaining she was deaf, she said one worker refused to communicate with her through written notes.

The woman, who does not want to be named, said the female member of staff ‘started kind of making fun of me and pointing to the paper’.

The situation escalated and a male supervisor was called over who initially also refused to communicate in writing, she said.

Wftv quotes the Minnesota resident as saying: ‘I said to him, “You know, this is illegal. You can’t refuse to serve a deaf person at the post office. This is a federal government building.” And that’s when he wrote the note.’

She said that the man then wrote down a message on a piece of paper saying: ‘Call your congressman, who do not (sic) have to write down for you. It’s not the law. Get an interpreter.’

According to Wftv, she said: ‘At that point, he started treating us like we were dogs, literally just motioning at us like we were dogs, like we needed to get out of here.’

A United States Postal Service spokesman told the News Journal that it ‘extends its sincere apologies’ to the customer.

The spokesman added: ‘Our expectation is that all customers will be treated with dignity and respect and receive courteous and helpful service from our employees.

‘Some situations present special challenges, such as language barriers, hearing and visual impairments, as well as others.

‘We always strive to meet the needs of the customers in all situations and deeply regret when we do not live up to that expectation.’

The spokesman said that it would take ‘swift remedial actions’ to address the incident.
