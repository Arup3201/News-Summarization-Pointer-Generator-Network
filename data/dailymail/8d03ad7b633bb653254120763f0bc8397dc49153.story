Prince Harry finally got the chance to celebrate his 30th birthday last night - with a black tie party featuring singer Ellie Goulding.

With his father, Prince Charles, and step-mother, the Duchess of Cornwall, on holiday in Scotland, the party-loving prince was given the run of their London residence, Clarence House.

The birthday boy drove himself in through the rear entrance to the house at 7.20pm with his protection officer by his side in the top-of-the-range Audi.

But it was unlikely, given Harry’s fondness for a good time, that he would be driving himself home to Kensington Palace again.

His brother, Prince William, arrived shortly afterwards, also driving himself in a brand new Range Rover.

He did not appear to be accompanied by his pregnant wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, however, who has been suffering from severe ante-natal sickness.

Most of Harry’s guests drove up through the gates in their car, pressing a printed invitation with a cypher on the top up against the window to a waiting police office for identification.

Several arrived by foot, however, wearing a mixture of suits and tuxedos and evening dresses.

Singer Ellie Goulding - who performed at William and Kate’s wedding reception - was said to be playing at the bash.

The Prince of Wales allowed Prince Harry to use Clarence House to host the star-studded bash 

Sources said she would be singing an ‘intimate acoustic’ set of some of her best-known hits, such as Lights and Burn, as well as a few special requests from Harry.

The pair have become firm friends, with the pair hugging and posing for photographs backstage at the closing concert of the prince’s Invictus Games on Sunday.

On Monday night - which was Harry’s actual birthday - Ellie tweeted a picture of a sunset and wrote:’Gorgeous sunset tonight. Happy Birthday H.’

Rumours that Harry was having a ski resort-themed party at Kensington Palace organised by Kate and her former party-planner sister, Pippa Middleton, at the weekend appear to have been wide of the mark.

But the party was still a well-deserved pat on the back for Harry after the phenomenal success of the Invictus Games, his Paralympic-style competition for injured servicemen which could be rolled out worldwide.
