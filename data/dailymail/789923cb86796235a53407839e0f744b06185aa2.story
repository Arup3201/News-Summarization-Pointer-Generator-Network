She was brutally cheated on by on-screen love rat Spencer Matthews this month.

But while her ex-boyfriend may be parading around town with new love interest Stephanie Pratt on his arm, Lucy Watson has wasted no time in showing him what he's missing.

The 22-year-old Made In Chelsea starlet has just been unveiled as the face of fashion brand Gorgeous Couture and smoulders in these exclusive campaign images.

Missing me Spencer? Made In Chelsea mean girl Lucy Watson smoulders in her new campaign for fashion brand Gorgeous Couture

Spencer who? Lucy Watson has just been unveiled as the new face of fashion brand Gorgeous Couture (monochrome dress, £139)

Ibiza heat: The campaign was shot in sunny Ibiza at The Ushuaïa Tower and Lucy replaces rival Louise Thompson as the face of the brand (blue dress, L, £139, and yellow dress, R, £134)

Monochrome madness: Lucy poses on all fours for the shoot and says she really enjoyed working with a team (dress £139)

Shot on location in sunny Ibiza, 
Lucy shows off her killer body as she poses in a series of 
figure-hugging summer dresses on her first professional fashion shoot.

The
 stunning brunette from Fulham has replaced Louise Thompson, her arch 
rival in the reality show, as the face of the luxury fashion brand.

Sneaking away from the Channel 4 
cameras for a weekend, the TV star spent a say posing at the brand new hotel The Ushuaïa Tower and around the Dalt Villa as well as teetering on heels by the sea.

Speaking about the shoot, Lucy said: 'It was hard work but I enjoyed seeing some of the results afterwards.

'It's a nice feeling to work hard and then see what you have achieved and I enjoy being part of a team.'

Beach babe: Lucy says she can go from being girly one minute to being a tomboy the next (red dress, £139)

Maximum style: Lucy says she feels more confident in form-fitting clothes (white dress, £279)

The Gorgeous Couture shoot is Lucy's 
first foray into fashion and she had a full glam squad on hand to primp 
her, including two make-up artists, one hairdresser and a celebrity 
stylist.

And it seems that she enjoyed it so much, she even sees a future for herself in fashion.

'I
 would love to design a clothes line, I like to think I have a bit of a 
creative mind and think it would be fun to plan a shoot for my work,' 
she said.

The
 TV star, who is famed for showing off a little too much flesh on the 
show, described her style as 'quite minimalistic' but added that she likes to make an 
outfit more interesting with maybe a statement necklace or a bright 
coloured item or lip colour.

Professional poser: The TV star was seen posing 
on the rooftop of the boutique hotel Es Vive, by the sea and in the 
picturesque old town in bright body con dresses and sky scraper heels 
(Blue dress, L, £229, and, R, £169)

Natural: Although it is her first fashion campaign, Lucy works it like a pro on set in Ibiza (red dress, L, £134, and carina dress, R, £119)

Style credentials: Lucy Quite describes her style as minimalistic but likes to make an outfit more interesting with  a statement necklace or a bright coloured item (dress £134)

She continued: 'I don't follow trends
 religiously but I do like to try them out. I can go from being girly 
one day to a bit of a tomboy the next.

'I
 always loved Mary Kate and Ashley's style and would love to have access
 to Rihanna's wardrobe for a day - her style is the one.'

And her biggest fashion faux pas?

'Wearing
 a floaty dress on a windy day. I tend to get sizes wrong and wear 
something that may be a bit big for me which I always regret later 
because I don't feel as confident,' she said.

Lucy joined Made In Chelsea last season and immediately ruffled feathers with her 'take me as I am' attitude.

Lucy Watson has been revealed as the face of fashion label Gorgeous Couture

She revels in her reputation as the show's mean girl and had been seeing bad boy Spencer Matthews, Louise's ex-boyfriend, since the beginning of the second series.

However, it has recently been revealed that the show's lothario cheated on her and has now found love with The Hills star and sister of Spencer Pratt, Stephanie.

And while Lucy was left heartbroken when she was unceremoniously cheated on, she was seen getting over the heartthrob last Thursday night as she spent the night with rugby player, Jordan Turner Hall.
