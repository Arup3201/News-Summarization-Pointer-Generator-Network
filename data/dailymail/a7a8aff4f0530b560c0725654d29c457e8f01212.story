A British woman is facing the death penalty after admitting smuggling 1.5kg of crystal meth into Indonesia. 

Former PCSO Andrea Waldeck, 43, was found with the drugs hidden inside black bags in her underwear when she was arrested in her hotel room. 

She was followed out of Surabaya airport in April after officers in Indonesia's second largest city got a tip-off she was carrying the drug.

She told authorities that she was ordered to deliver 3lb of the highly addictive drug by her boyfriend in exchange for £3,100. She was arrested in April after a tip off to police. 

Until February last year, she worked as a PCSO for Gloucestershire Police.

After leaving her job, Waldeck travelled to the other side of the world to become part of what prosecutors called 'evil conspiracy' involving an Indonesian drug-smuggling gang. 

Waldeck was declared bankrupt in 2009 with debts of more than £120,000.

She previously said: 'I want to write a book about my experiences here. I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I've been through.'

Just weeks ago she told friends on a Facebook message: 'Your support means the world to me. I’m so very sorry I’ve disappointed you all.'

After her arrest, Waldeck co-operated with police in a double sting, first meeting a contact who was arrested as he arrived to collect the drugs from her hotel and then flying under police guard with the other suspect to the capital Jakarta.

On May 2, Waldeck and the other suspect took part in a further sting, meeting another of the drug syndicate's members in a Jakarta street where he was arrested after they passed the drugs on to him. 

Waldeck was then transferred to chronically-overcrowded Medaeng after spending the first four months after her arrest in police cells in Jakarta.

She was the only Western prisoner in Medaeng prison, where she shared a cramped cell with 16 other women.

Now she has been convicted she is the second British woman facing the firing squad in Indonesia for drug-smuggling.

Grandmother Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to death in January after cocaine worth an estimated £1.6million was found in the lining of her suitcase.

While we referred to Andrea Waldeck as a ‘policewoman’, we are happy to make clear that she was, in fact, not a police officer but a Community Support Officer (CSO). CSOs were created by the Police Reform Act 2002, and they are civilian employees.
