Police dramatically arrested a man at gunpoint
just steps from Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on
Thursday, underscoring tensions in the capital Ottawa a day
after a gunman killed a soldier and rampaged through parliament.

Harper and his wife were laying a wreath at the National War
Memorial to commemorate the killing of the soldier there when
police, shouting and with guns drawn, surrounded a man and
ordered him to the ground.

Ottawa Police said the man was arrested for 'disturbing the
crime scene' at the war memorial. It was not immediately clear
what was the man's intent.

'He crossed the tape. We told him not to. He didn't listen,'
said a police officer at the scene.

The tense moment, captured on camera and seen by throngs of
people and politicians who had gathered at the war memorial,
highlighted tensions in Ottawa a day after a reported convert to
Islam fatally shot a soldier there and raced through Parliament
before being killed himself.

Harper himself was pulled back from the crime scene after he
and his wife briefly lifted the crime scene tape and attempted
to lay flowers, and then reversed themselves and laid their
wreath outside the crime scene.

Employees began returning to the Parliament Hill complex
amid tighter security. The House of Commons was set to open on
schedule at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), with the prime minister speaking
at that time.

Tighter security was evident all over the sprawling
parliamentary zone in downtown Ottawa. Armed Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (RCMP) officers stood outside the door where the
gunman, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, rushed in on
Wednesday.

The flag flying over Parliament's Centre Block, where the
gunman had burst in on Wednesday morning, was at half mast.

Members of Parliament said they would gather at the War
Memorial, near the parliament, to honor Canadian soldier Nathan
Cirillo who was shot at the site.

Parliament Hill and the downtown core were under lockdown
for 10 hours on Wednesday as police scoured the area for more 
possible suspects.

'There was only one gunman,' said an RCMP officer who was
guarding Parliament Hill early on Thursday, checking the
identity cards of workers and media going into the parliament
complex.

He said in the confusion on Wednesday morning, witnesses saw
things from different angles, suggesting the possibility of
second shooter but videos and further interviews showed this was
not the case.

The killing of the Canadian soldier was the second this week
with a possible link to Islamist militants.

In a brief address to the nation on Wednesday night, Harper
pledged to redouble the country's fight against 'terrorist
organizations.

'Let there be no misunderstanding, we will not be
intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.

'This will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble
our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take
all necessary steps to identify and counter threats.'

SERGEANT-AT-ARMS Kevin Vickers is being hailed a hero for shooting dead the gunman inside Canada’s parliament.

Mr Vickers, 58, was praised by politicians for ‘selflessly keeping them safe’ after grabbing a gun he keeps in his office amid the rampage.

A hero's welcome: Mr Vickers was greeted by a moving standing ovation just hours after he stopped terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau

It was the first time he fired his gun in a career spanning nearly thirty years 

The sergeant-at-arms is the person responsible for safety and security of parliament and has the ceremonial role of carrying a gold mace into the House of Commons. Ex-policeman Mr Vickers has held the position for eight years.

MP Craig Scott wrote on Twitter: ‘MPs … owe their safety, even lives, to sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.’

Minister Julian Fantino added that he was ‘profoundly grateful’ for Mr Vickers’ ‘selfless act.' 

In Parliament on Thursday the public servant was greeted with a moving standing ovation 

An emotional Mr Vickers gave a humble nod of his head at the ceremony as he bravely returned to work just a day after saving the lives of his co-workers 

His sister, Mary, told the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers released a statement Thursday afternoon. 

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

A convert to Islam on Monday ran over two Canadian soldiers
with his car, killing one, near Montreal.

Both attacks took place after Canada announced this month it
would send six jets to take part in air strikes against Islamic
State fighters who have taken over parts of Iraq and Syria.

Harper said Canada would now 'redouble our efforts to work
with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist
organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the
hope of bringing their savagery to our shores'.

Defence Minister Rob Nicholson said Canada's deployment to
Iraq would go on unimpeded. 

The two attacks in quick succession could push the Canadian
government to pause and rethink before introducing a planned
bill to change the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act,
said Wesley Wark, a professor at the University of Ottawa, who
is an expert on national security and intelligence issues.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. 

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. 

We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.' 

The bill to boost the powers of Canada's main spy agency,
CSIS, was due to be introduced in parliament this week.

'What the government is now confronting is a choice with
going forward on whatever its original, probably small-scale
changes might have been, or sitting back and thinking about
whether there is something more that needs to be done,' he said.

Canadian police were investigating Michael Zehaf-Bibeau for Wednesday's attack. His emotional mother - a high-ranking immigration official - appeared to confirm his involvement adding she was 'so sad a man lost his life'.

Court documents show the convert whose full name was 'Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau' previously faced a robbery charge in
Vancouver and multiple drug-related charges in Montreal.
