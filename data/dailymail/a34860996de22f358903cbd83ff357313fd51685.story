Too young: Jennifer McPartland, 28, was found dead in a creek more than 12 hours after she veered off a Texas country road

A frantic search for a missing mother of two from Texas ended Wednesday afternoon with the discovery of her body in a creek, leaving her devastated husband sobbing on his knees in the middle of a country road.

The heartrending scene played out at around 4pm yesterday as Cory McPartland got the news that a dive team had located the body of his wife, Jennifer, in nearby Oyster Creek not far from her waterlogged car.

Upon hearing that his wife and the mother of their two children was dead, Mr McPartland cried out ‘No!’ several times and had to be restrained by his relatives.

Jennifer's mother, Sherry Berel, and her son-in-law later both slumped to the wet ground in tears as they stood in a tight circle with other family members.

It all started at around 1am Wednesday when the 28-year-old Clute resident was reported missing.

The last time anyone heard from the mother of two, Mrs McPartland was driving to a friend's home along FM 521 shortly before midnight, the station KHOU11 reported.

Police believe the woman veered off the two-lane unlit road and ended up in Oyster Creek.

Cory McPartland went looking for his wife overnight and discovered her vehicle submerged in about 7 feet of water.

The man dove into the murky creek hoping to find the 28-year-old alive, but only managed to locate her phone, wallet and bag. 

Texas EquuSearch volunteers joined the effort and came upon what appeared to be Jennifer McPartland's jacket.

Armed with sonar equipment, the divers were then able to find the young mother's body about 100 feet from her car.

‘The windows were down,’ Tim Miller, of Texas EquuSearch, told Fox26. ‘She may have tried to swim out or something.’

Investigators say no foul play is suspected in Mrs McPartland’s death. An autopsy will be performed on her body.

According to a GoFundMe page set up by a cousin to raise $20,000 towards the victim's final expenses, Jennifer leaves behind two children ages 2 and 4 named Jace and Auvriella.
