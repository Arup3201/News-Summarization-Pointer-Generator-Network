They were undoubtedly the main attraction. Two rays of South American sunshine to pierce the gloom of a freezing January afternoon in Manchester, two dashes of spice sprinkled on the already-tasty dish of Manchester City versus Arsenal.

In the blue corner, Sergio Aguero of Argentina. Back in business, fit again and firing after injury and hotly-fancied to add to his 19 goal tally for the season so far.

In the red corner (well yellow and blue), Alexis Sanchez of Chile. A £30m man who has paid back his hefty transfer fee already; exceeding even the loftiest of pre-season expectations with his 18 goals, copious assists and a seldom-found and whole-hearted desire to play in EVERY single game.

Aguero and Sanchez were worth the admission money alone at the Etihad Stadium - they belong to that magical category of players who make impressionable young fans fall in love with the game.

But in the first-half just one of the pair made any impression. The opening 45 minutes was a collector's item in itself - a modern Arsenal team travelling away to one of the big teams and dominating proceedings.

Goalkeeper David Ospina was redundant, quite incredibly, as Arsenal controlled the game and, better yet, gained the lead through a Santi Cazorla penalty after Nacho Monreal was brought down - how easily is another debate - by Vincent Kompany.

But that seemed to be the only moment when Sanchez wasn't involved. The Chilean was holding the baton, conducting the orchestra and yet also playing some solos of his own.

Fernandinho had been assigned the task of minder. Early on, Sanchez played the role of little silver ball to pinball machine bumper.

On six minutes, he showed immaculate chest control to bring an Arsenal move infield but the Brazilian snatched the ball. Game over.

Sanchez would have to be persistent. He mainly occupied the open acres on the left but willingly drove inside. At one point, he thrillingly squeezed between two blue shirts only to be swallowed by four more on the edge of the box.

As has so often been shown this season, Sanchez is indefatigable. One minute he was performing defensive duties, dispossessing James Milner and knocking it out for a throw, the next he was charging down Martin Demichelis as he hacked clear.

As Arsenal sat back a little more following Cazorla's penalty, Sanchez refused to follow suit but his forward charges increasingly led down blind alleys. Fernandinho started to take control and perhaps the Chilean might have dropped back more to help the increasingly-stretched back line.

But what of Aguero? Frankly, he was anonymous. For a side who found themselves five points behind leaders Chelsea after Saturday's action, they had surprisingly little impetus.

On 34 minutes, the Argentine positioned his body to win a corner - set-pieces were pretty much their only threat in the first-half - but it was his first contribution in about 25 minutes.

Ironically, the corner was headed away by, you've guessed it, Alexis Sanchez.

The start of the second-half suggested the tide was turning. City started brightly, pressed incessantly and looked like scoring at last.

Aguero set the tone, cutting inside from the right, onto his left foot, before forcing a fingertip save from Ospina.

All of a sudden, he was everywhere, the touchpaper lit. He tried to shoot with the outside of his right boot but it sliced away from goal as unmarked team-mates glared at him.

The equaliser seemed inevitable. Sanchez just wasn't in the game, his ball-carrying instinct nullified as Arsenal struggled to gain the ball. Then, out of nowhere, a sucker punch.

Fernando was caught napping, Cazorla pinched the ball and Olivier Giroud headed home for 2-0. As the Arsenal players celebrated with knee slides in front of their delirious fans, Sanchez greeted the goal with a high-pitched screech. It obviously meant a lot.

In all honesty, Cazorla was overshadowing everyone. The man known as the 'Little Magician' was outstanding, the best on the park. His execution of the first-half penalty was perfect, his cross for the second unstoppable.

Like Sanchez, he drove Arsenal on - probably more often. You lost count of the number of times the No 19 was visible on the back, streaking away into space.

While Sanchez was impressive, it was Santi Cazorla who made more of a difference for Arsenal

His touch was assured, his energy limitless, his creativity infinite. Cazorla was the difference.  

Still, despite his efforts, you sensed a big finale was in store. Aguero's partner-in-crime, Edin Dzeko was introduced from the bench.

Sanchez exited the stage with seven minutes left, replaced by Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal shored up the barricades. The travelling fans applauded warmly, it had been another excellent performance by their star signing from the summer. 

Moments later, Aguero raced 60 yards to catch up with Gibbs as he sprinted clear down the left. The striker pulled back his shirt and earned a booking. The effort was admirable but it kind of summed up his afternoon. 

The late onslaught never came, this was a poor City display. The Etihad was half-empty long before the end as a massive blow in the title race was dealt.

Sanchez had well and truly got the better of Aguero in the battle of the South Americans.
