She's well known for her feminine style and now Rochelle Humes has channelled her passion for fashion into a summer clothing collection she promises will make women everywhere feel confident.

The star, 26, has unveiled and modelled her latest designs for e-tailer Very - and proves she knows a thing or two about how to flatter the female form.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her spring/summer range - her fourth for the fashion site - Rochelle said: 'I took my inspiration from my friends, the catwalks and what I love to wear myself. 

'I also listened to customer feedback and asked my fans questions on Twitter, it's all part of the journey and I want my fans to feel involved.'

The new range, which Rochelle describes as 'feminine, girly and sexy', takes note of the season's key trends, all whilst keeping different shapes and sizes in mind. 

'The collection is bold yet understated at the same time,' she said. 'I wanted to create pieces that get noticed for the little details, I love using different textures and adding a hint of lace or embellishment. It's such a versatile collection that is easy to wear day or night throughout the season.'

The mother-of-one has included casual pieces, such as floral cigarette trousers and a monochrome double breasted striped coat, whilst scuba and skater dresses are designed with date night in mind. 

'These designs will make you feel confident,' promised Rochelle, who describes her own style as 'feminine, structured and classy'.

The singer, who welcomed baby Alaia-Mai with former JLS star husband, Marvin, admits her style has changed since becoming a mother. 

'I would say I am more conscious now I'm a mum, she admits. 'I wouldn't go out in a belly top like I used to but I'm still me.'

Rochelle isn't the only member of The Saturdays making waves in the fashion world; Mollie King recently teamed up with Oasis to create a springtime edit.

'Sharing style tips comes with the territory of being in a pop group,' said Rochelle of her stylish pals.

'We always share clothes and the best thing is we can say to each other "don't wear that!".' 

The Saturdays star showcased her new  collection at The Portico Rooms in Somerset House on Tuesday afternoon.

Sporting looks from her collection, the singer was joined by her husband Marvin and their famous friends at the exclusive launch in London.
