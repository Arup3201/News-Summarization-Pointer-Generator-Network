Switzerland are now higher than England in the FIFA world rankings. They topped their qualifying group for the 2014 World Cup. After making it out of a group containing France, Ecuador and Honduras they suffered extra-time heartbreak against Argentina in the last 16, as they lost 1-0. SAM CUNNINGHAM runs the rule over the men who are gunning for the Three Lions.

Magic Dwarf 

Xherdan Shaqiri 

Position: winger 

Age : 22 

Club: Bayern Munich

Architect: What he lacks in height, Xherdan Shaqiri more than makes up for with his bulging thighs

Switzerland

Capital: Bern

Official languages: German, French, Italian, Romansh.

Known as the Alpine Messi or the Magic Dwarf, Xherdan Shaqiri is the architect of the team from the wing. He is only 5ft 6ins tall but what he lacks in height, he more than makes up for with his bulging thighs. That is where his power and pace are generated from and he uses a special elastic band in training to increase their strength. Shaqiri announced himself to English football fans when he set up two goals for Basel as Manchester United lost 2-1 and were dumped out of the 2011 Champions League group stage. He set the World Cup alight when he scored a hattrick against Honduras in the group stage to send Switzerland through.

Charity worker 

Vladimir Pet kovic 

Position manager 

Age 51

Previous clubs Bellinzona Lazio, Sion, Young Boys 

When Petkovic's modest playing career was winding down in the mid-1990s he worked for Caritas, a Catholic relief charity. Alongside that he started coaching Swiss second division side Bellinzona where he won promotion and reached the Swiss cup final. Tottenham fans will remember him for giving them a scare in the 2010 Champions League preliminary round, winning 3-2 at home while in charge of Young Boys before losing 4-0 in the second leg. He likens his style to Arsene Wenger and Fabio Capello. 'I tried to steal everything that I found to be good from other coaches in order to develop my own ideas,' said Petkovic, who speaks seven languages. 'I have always liked the solidity of Fabio Capello. I liked the ideas that Arsene Wenger had with Arsenal a lot.'

Pedigree: Admir Mehmedi played for Switzerland at five youth levels before breaking into the senior side

Mr Confident 

Admir Mehmedi 

Position Striker 

Age 23 

Club SC Freiburg

Scouts from Liverpool and Sunderland watched Admir Mehmedi at Zurich when he was 20, but he eventually moved to the Ukraine to play for Dynamo Kiev before arriving in Germany for his current club. He is of Macedonian Albanian descent, but played for Switzerland at five youth levels before breaking into the senior side in 2011. His scoring rate is not prolific for the national side, but he is certainly not short of confidence. When asked if he had done his homework on Lionel Messi before their World Cup last-16 match, he replied: 'I haven't watched any videos of Lionel Messi or any of their players. I'm Admir Mehmedi, I don't have to compare myself to anybody.'

Clever: Granit Xhaka (right) is considered an intellect among his peers

The young Einstein 

Granit Xhaka 

Position midfielder 

Age 21 

Club Borussia Monchengladbach

Granit Xhaka loves science and is considered an intellect among his peers, which is why he is called 'the young Einstein' by his team-mates. While at Basel he was a target for Liverpool and Manchester United before he moved to Germany. Liverpool renewed their interest in Xhaka in the summer after the youngster had starred for the Swiss at the World Cup, where he scored his fifth international goal in the defeat by France.
