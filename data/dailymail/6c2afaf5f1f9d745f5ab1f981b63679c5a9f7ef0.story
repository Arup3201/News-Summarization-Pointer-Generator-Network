Home buyers can breathe a sign of relief as the price growth of homes that have previously seen record breaking auction reserves smashed, will slow down for 2015.

Although its seeing less than half of it's price growth of last year, Sydney will continue to thrash the rest of the country in house costs with an eight percent rise, compared to a national growth of around five percent.

According to the Domain Group's latest figures, Brisbane will surprisingly outperform the other capital cities as well with a rise of 6 percent, whilst Melbourne sits lower on a moderate four to five percent growth.

This property is for sale in Pymble, 16 kilometres north-west of Sydney CBD which retains a house price rise of eight percent, much lower than 2014's 12.2%

The grand estate at 42 Telegraph Road, Pymble boasts six bedrooms, five bathrooms and three car spots and a deluxe marble kitchen

Cascading lawns engulf the property, containing a tennis court and swimming pool all privately set on 3389sqm in Pymble

Additional features of the property include a formal lounge, dining room, billiard room, wine cellar, fireplaces and parquetry floors

Hornsby will see a rise in popularity this year with homes like this one going on the market

This home contains five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a sun-filled conservatory, a stone atrium and a double automatic garage

'Hornsby is having a good run but further North on the Central Coast hasn't really got the employment growth,' said Angie Zigomanis from BIS Shrapnel

Although record low interest rates are showing a climb in property competition, first home buyers and those looking to upgrade will still have trouble.

Sydney's north western, upper north and inner-west suburbs will show the most price growth with an expected 10 percent rise.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics however, this is still less than Sydney's 12.2 percent rise from last year. 

'Sydney's resilience is largely driven by its property shortages,' Domain senior economist Andrew Wilson told The Australian Financial Review.

'However, investor activity remains at record levels and this is another key driver of the price growth being seen.'

Last year we saw the top performing suburbs demonstrating the best growth in the last 12 months actually occurred far from the nation's CBDs.

Angie Zigomanis from BIS Shrapnel told Daily Mail Australia that whilst exact suburbs cannot be determined this early on, We are definitely seeing a ripple effect.

'In Sydney the middle to outer Western suburbs will experience growth in popularity,' he said.

'Hornsby is having a good run but further North on the Central Coast hasn't really got the employment growth.' 

This home at 19 Ormadale Road Yeronga, seven kilometres south of Brisbane CBD is located in the area that has seen a six percent rise in home pricing

The picturesque home is located on 2725 square metres of riverfront property incredibly close to Brisbane's CBD

The home is built over three levels and contains marble sourced from around the world and custom bespoke designed wool carpets

There are six bedrooms, five bathrooms and six garage spaces as well as a huge cellar, spa and steam room

Mr Zigomanis says Melbourne will be somewhat similar with the Western suburbs and even slightly East gaining popularity.

'It changes every year, often you refer to the median prices,' he said.

'But Brisbane's inner to middle is starting to rise at a stronger rate.' 

The other cities are not expected to fare as well, with properties in the outer north-west of Melbourne will only be up by two percent whereas inner-Melbourne suburbs will be up by four to five percent.

'The Melbourne housing market weakened over 2014, dragged down by an under performing of local economy,' Mr. Wilson said. 

The Bureau of statistics documented that Melbourne saw a four and a half percent growth in 2014, much lower than its whopping 10 percent in 2013. 

Although Melbourne's property price growth has lessened, sitting on around 5 percent, areas like the Docklands is where the rise remains

This property at 40 South Wharf Drive in the Docklands Melbourne, is for sale and boasts four bedrooms, five bathrooms and four car spaces

It's feature include panoramically proportioned glass walls, a lap-pool, a private boat mooring, home cinema, gym, steam room and cellar

Brisbane has seen an improvement in its price growth of homes since its interest cuts in 2012-13 and is now coasting along. 

Adelaide and Hobart are expected to have a moderate growth this year with both seeing between 3 percent and five percent growth.

Perth, Darwin and Canberra are nearly breaking even with a rise of only two percent.
