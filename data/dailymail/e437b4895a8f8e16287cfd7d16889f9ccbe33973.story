Tributes are pouring in for two University of Richmond basketball coaches killed in a fiery hot air balloon crash Friday night.

Ginny Doyle, 44, was associate head women's basketball coach and Natalie Lewis, 24, director of basketball operations, are presumed dead after their balloon struck power lines and burst into flames over Caroline County, Virginia.

The pilot of the doomed airship has been identified as Daniel T. Kirk, a retired U.S. Army officer with 30 years of flying experience.

Investigators say Mr Kirk, the owner of Captain Kirk Starship Adventures, tried desperately to save the balloon after it caught fire. He opened to top vent to stop the fire from sending the craft even higher and took other emergency maneuvers before the basket and its three passengers separated from the from balloon and plummeted to Earth.

Investigators recovered the bodies of Doyle and Kirk Saturday near a subdivision in Caroline County. On Sunday, they found Lewis' body, as well - confirming that all three people aboard the balloon died in the crash.

Lewis, a star swimmer and varsity athlete at the University of 
Richmond. She had recently gotten engaged. Her parents flew to Richmond 
from their home in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday.

Doyle
 tweeted earlier in the day that their takeoff was initially scheduled 
for the morning but pushed back due to fog before later writing 'getting
 ready to go up' only minutes before she died when the balloon she was 
in burst into flames.

The two women were originally supposed to liftoff in one of three balloons scheduled for a 6.30 a.m. voyage, Doyle said on Twitter. That trip was delayed until around 4.00 p.m. because of heavy fog.

Doyle posted pictures Friday morning of her and Lewis in a hot air balloon that was tethered to the ground. The flight was not allowed to go up because of the fog.

'Getting ready to go up!' Doyle tweeted at 3.45 p.m. along with a picture of her and Lewis in front of the balloon that would eventually take their lives.

At the University of Richmond, student athletes, faculty and administrators were in mourning. Two weekend baseball games were canceled and the university stopped commencement Saturday for a moment of silence to remember Doyle and Lewis, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports.

Daniel T. Kirk executed several emergency maneuvers in an attempt to save the doomed balloon, investigators say

'Words cannot begin to express our sorrow,' Richmond's athletics direction Keith Gill said in a statement.

'We are all stunned by the tragic news. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their loved ones.'

The pilot of the doomed balloon was Daniel T. Kirk, his father Donald Kirk confirmed to NBC News.

Kirk was a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Donald Kirk said, who had been flying hot air balloons for 30 years and owned Captain Kirk Starship Adventures.

The elder Kirk said he had gone up with his son more than 40 times and that Friday's crash was 'just a freak accident.'

Horrified onlookers Friday heard the women screaming for help as they desperately jumped from the basket to escape the flames.

'Help me, help me, sweet Jesus, help. I'm going to die. Oh my God, I'm going to die,' witnesses reported hearing one of them scream as the basket and balloon separated.

Lewis' remains have not yet been found, but her parents have arrived from Buffalo, New York, to help in the search effort despite teams suspending operations until Sunday due to darkness, the paper reported.

'The search continues for our beloved daughter and we remain hopeful and ask for your continued prayers,' parents Patricia and Evan Lewis Sr. said in a statement.

The doomed flight was part of a VIP event Friday night meant to kick off the first balloon festival in the region in decades, according to the Times-Dispatch.

'Because of
 the time that has transpired since the hot air balloon crash Friday 
evening and the fact that we have not been able to make any contact with
 any of the three occupants that were in the hot air balloon we are now 
transitioning from a rescue operation to a recovery operation at this 
time,' State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Saturday morning.

Frantic: The pilot reportedly started taking the necessary security precautions like trying to open the top of the balloon because the fire would cause the balloon to travel higher faster

Before the split: At one point after the explosion, the basket and the balloon separated

Under investigation: Heidi Moats, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator, briefed on the recovery operation Saturday afternoon

The discovery of the second body came a few hours after the press conference.

'Just before midnight we were able to locate one of the occupants.

'We
 do know who was on the - the two passengers and the pilot- we have been
 in contact with their families overnight but at this point we are not 
going to identify which one of those occupants has been recovered.'

Heidi Moats, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator, briefed on the recovery operation Saturday afternoon.

The names of the individuals have not been officially released, but local newspaper The Henrico Citizen has reported that the two passengers were members of the University of Richmond women's basketball coaching staff. The team's website names the male head coach and five female assistant coaches.

The
 incident took place at around 8pm at the Meadow Event Park in Caroline 
County - the site of the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival.

An
 eyewitness reported seeing one or two balloons drifting into power 
lines and bursting into flames in the skies over Carmel Church Road. 

Three 
balloons took off at the same time and the first two had no issues with 
their landing, but that wasn't the case for the third.

'As
 the third balloon made its descent, it made contact with a live 
utility wire. That in turn sparked a fire with the hot air balloon,' Ms 
Geller said.

Desperate: The balloon that caught fire was the third in a group of three that were due to land at a festival but after the other two made safe descents, the third balloon hit a utility wire and caught fire

'The
 fire spread quickly the pilot of the hot air balloon, based on witness 
accounts and the other pilots who were on the ground, began doing his 
various safety maneuvers and trying to manage the fire.'

She
 said that witnesses saw the pilot 'try to open up the top of the 
balloon which is standard procedure because the added heat and intensity
 of the fire will actually make the balloon rise faster so he was taking
 every effort he could to manage and extinguish the fire.'

People who were present at the event recalled seeing some passengers leaping from the basket.

'According
 to witnesses they say they heard an explosion and it was after that 
that the basket and the balloon actually separated,' Ms Geller said.

'We are still in the process- and we spent all night- searching for the wreckage, the basket, the balloon.'

Carrie
 Hager-Bradley said she saw the balloon in flames on her way home from 
the grocery store and heard people yelling, according to WWBT TV.

Search continues: Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corine Geller (left) said that the search went on through the night with helicopters (right) and will continue through Saturday with the aid of hundreds of state troopers

'They were just screaming for anybody to help them,' the station quoted her as saying.

‘We saw black smoke coming from an object,’ eyewitness Cole Holocker told NBC News.

‘Couldn't tell what it was. We thought it might be exhaust from a 
helicopter around the base and then, when we came close to it, we could 
see it was a balloon.’

The
 18-year-old college student added that he saw the structure of the 
balloon collapse before it plummeted to the ground, landing behind the 
tree line.

Festival goer Nancy Johnson posted a photo on her Instagram account showing the ill-fated balloon right before the fire.

Some hot air balloons landed 
safely in Debra Ferguson's yard, she was quoted by The Free Lance-Star 
of Fredericksburg, Virginia, as saying.

She said one of the men in the balloons pointed up at another still in the air and said he thought it might be in trouble.

'As soon as we looked up, the thing blew up right there,' the newspaper quoted Ferguson as saying. "All I heard was, "Oh my God, Oh my God," and all you saw was the top of the balloon still flying, but all of the basket was gone. All of the flames just disappeared. ... It was like a match — poof — and then it was gone.'

Caroline County resident Paula Dustin said she and her family and a friend were watching the balloons inflate and take off when they saw one in the distance that appeared to be in distress.

'We saw a glow, and you could tell the bottom of the balloon was in flames,' Dustin was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
