Glimpses of his golden flesh were hard to miss in the background during the telecast of Wednesday's game between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers.

And now this oblivious baseball fan - who chose to strip off and catch some rays during the 5 hours and 34 minute day game - has become an international sensation.

Images of the satisfied-looking supporter - complete with the empty beer cans and hot dog trays sitting next to him - have gone viral around the world.

Biggest fan: This Los Angeles Dodgers fan has gained quite an online following after pictures of him sun-baking during Wednesdays game between the Washington Nationals were circulated online

Enjoying himself: Photos of the Dodgers supporters with his shorts rolled up and shirt - as well the food and beer collection to his side - had social media hailing him the 'new American Hero'

Spoof: The man, who has not yet been identified, has also become something of the 'joke of the week'

Even a Beliguim news website have reported on the portly patron, referring to him as 'the rather corpulent protagonist'.

As Yahoo Sports' The Post Game reported, this man - who is yet to be identified - has seemingly become famous for doing nothing but enjoy a sunny California day.

Some social media users have hailed him the new 'American Hero' and the Dodgers 'Fan of the Year'.

Others have called upon ABC's late-night funny man Jimmy Kimmel to track the Dodgers disciple down and feature him on the show.

Some suggested it may have even been a prank organized by Kimmel.

Just kidding: The now-famous Dodgers fan was superimposed on this scene from FX sitcom It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, among others

It has also spawned a slew of spoof 
images, including one of him superimposed into a scene from FX sitcom 
It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.

A Russian-language version of Eurosport ran the headline: 'Man ‘Dodgers’ became a celebrity doing nothing.'

The accompanying story read:'During the broadcast into the frame fan hosts, sunbathing on the podium.

'His photos immediately broke up on the internet, even though he did not do anything for this.'
