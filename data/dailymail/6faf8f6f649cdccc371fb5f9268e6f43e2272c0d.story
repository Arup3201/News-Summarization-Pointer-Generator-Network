The man who supervised the execution of five inmates in US prisons has revealed the massive emotional toll that his role took on him.

In an interview with BBC’s HARDtalk programme, Dr Allen Ault revealed what turned him from the corrections commissioner for the U.S. state of Georgia to a passionate anti-death penalty campaigner.

‘I still have nightmares,’ Dr Ault said in the interview.

Allen Ault, the former commissioner of corrections for the state of Georgia talked about his experience overseeing executions at the prison

'I have spent a lifetime... regretting every moment and every killing': In a heartfelt interview with HARDtalk, Allen Ault opened up about the five executions he oversaw

‘Although it is state-sanctioned, it is by every definition premeditated murder… It’s the most premeditated form of murder you can possibly imagine and it stays in your psyche forever.’

Dr Ault is a trained psychologist who began working in the prison system in order to help and rehabilitate people, but a promotion to the position of corrections commissioner meant the responsibility for overseeing the state’s executions fell to him.

During his time at the prison in the early 1990s, Dr Ault supervised the five executions. The first two executed were Christopher Burger and Thomas Steven, who were accused of a brutal rape and murder in 1977.

At the time of the murder Burger was 17 with a borderline mental impairment.

He spent 17 years on death row during which time he got an education, received counselling and changed dramatically.

‘He was a different human being,’ said Dr Ault, who added that Burger felt enormous remorse for his crime and his last words were 'Please forgive me'.

Those under Dr Ault’s supervision were killed on the electric chair, a method of execution that was outlawed in the state of Georgia in 2001 after the Supreme Court ruled it was a cruel and unusual punishment. The state now uses lethal injection.

Dr Ault described watching Burger’s death. ‘We could see the jolt of electricity running through this individual’s body. Snapped his head back and then there was just total silence. And I knew I had killed another human being.’

Executions at the Georgia prison were carried out by electric chair, a method that was ruled to be 'cruel and unusual punishment' by the Georgia Supreme Court in 2001

He said that the executions were ‘a small part of the job,’ which also involved supervising 15,000 employees and managing the prison, but it was the part of the job that has continued to haunt him.

‘I have spent a lifetime since then regretting every moment and every killing,’ he said in the interview.

‘I was the vehicle for the execution and I have no defence for that.’

Dr Ault resigned from his position in 1995, but by then ‘It was too late'. Since resigning, he has received counselling to process his role in the executions.

Haunted: William Henry Hance was one of the five men executed while Dr Ault was commissioner at the prison

He is now the dean of the College of Justice & Safety at Eastern Kentucky University and a strident anti-death penalty campaigner.

Together with two other former prison director and two former wardens, Dr Ault fights to stop executions. They appear before legislative groups and campaign on individual cases.

‘I have many of compatriots who were directors who have gone through this… I don’t know any of them that haven’t shed a lot of tears over it,’ he told HARDtalk.

Another execution that has stayed with Dr Auld was that of William Henry Hance, a black man convicted of murdering three women.

After the trial, one black member of the jury described the atmosphere among the majority white jury as one of racial intimidation, with one white juror saying that the execution would leave ‘one less n****r to breed.’

Despite this, and the fact that Hance’s IQ was so low that some experts believed he was not competent to enter a plea, Hance was executed under Dr Ault’s supervision.

Dr Ault says there is definitely a racial dimension to executions.

‘Black people who kill whites are about three times more likely to receive the death penalty than the other way round.’

Georgia is one of 32 states in which the death penalty is legal.

Last year there were 39 executions in the U.S. and there have been eight so far in 2014.
