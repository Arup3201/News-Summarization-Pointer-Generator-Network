A 50-year-old father has converted the derelict Victorian baths where he learned to swim into a £1.2million luxury family home.

Paul Smith was heartbroken at seeing the swimming pool of his childhood, which lies on the coast at Penarth, near Cardiff, fall into ruin.

He decided to turn the beautiful 19th-century building into his dream house, giving it a comfortable modern feel while retaining its unique character.

Memories: Mr Smith was devastated when the baths fell into disrepair after being closed to the public

The five-bedroom home boasts elaborate stone window 
dressings, archways and vaulted ceilings and still features 
the original intricate brick and ironwork.

Mr Smith, who runs a scaffolding company, said: 'When I was a child I use to go swimming there every Saturday morning.

'I originally looked into the building with no interest in buying it whatsoever, but when I was inside I had an "Oh my god" moment.

'The feeling when you walk inside it’s really fantastic. You can see so much of history of the place when you are in there.'

The baths closed to the public 30 years 
ago. They were briefly used as a pub called Inn At The Deep End before 
being boarded up and left to fall into disrepair.

But Mr Smith, who is married with two grown-up children, committed himself to a major renovation and converted the building into a chic designer home.

The property now has its own indoor spa complete with steam room, sauna and jacuzzi.

It spans 5,000 square feet over three storeys and includes ensuite bathrooms, a dressing room and a home cinema.

Mr Smith is now preparing to wave 
goodbye to the dream home he lovingly created and has put it on the 
market at an asking price of £1.2m.

A spokesman for estate agents Savills, of Cardiff, called it 'an extraordinary luxury home of considerable style and character'.

'It offers incredibly spacious accommodation in a most interesting and versatile layout', he said.

'It forms part of an iconic former municipal baths, enviably positioned immediately on the seafront enjoying open sea views and just steps away from the charming Victorian pier.'

Relaxing: The house has five chic bedrooms with elaborate stone window sills
