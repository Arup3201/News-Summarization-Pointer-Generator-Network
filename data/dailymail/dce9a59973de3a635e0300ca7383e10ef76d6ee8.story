When my mother was diagnosed with terminal of breast cancer, she was devastated but also surprised because, as she put it, 'we weren't a cancer family'. There was no strong history of the disease whatsoever.

Her mother had died of lung failure after years of smoking and other relatives had succumbed to heart disease. An American cousin had died of breast cancer, but that felt, both genetically and geographically, far removed.

But eight years later, at the end of 
2010, I was told that I was a carrier of the BRCA1 mutation - an genetic
 abnormality which makes me far more likely than non-carriers to get 
breast cancer. It also makes me highly susceptible 
to ovarian cancer.

The lifetime chance of a woman developing breast cancer is 10 per cent, but this goes up to 80 per cent  if they possess a mutated BRCA gene. The gene also raises the risk of developing ovarian cancer from 1.4 per cent to up to 40 per cent.

My brother had been urging me for several months to take the BRCA test. But I didn't think it was necessary - given our cancer-free family history, it had never occurred to me that my mother’s cancer was a result of a genetic fault.

Eventually I decided to go ahead - but more to shut him up than because I was concerned about being a carrier. 

I was living in Tokyo at the time with my husband and son Ari, now 6, and Racheli, 5.

I had an excellent GP who managed to find a Japanese geneticist who could arrange the tests.

At my first visit, he told me that I would have to undergo several genetic counselling sessions to help me decide whether or not to have the test.

But I told him that I was already decided. I would do the test at my next visit. 

I reassured him that if I were found to have the mutation, I would have a mastectomy and an oophorectomy. 

Gaby, pictured with her two children, said that she didn't think she needed the BRCA test because there was no history of the cancer in the family. She had believed her mother's cancer was simply a case of bad luck.

Gaby wanted another baby before she underwent preventative surgery but her husband Gary (pictured) said that this wasn't a good reason to have another child

I have since realised how very easy it is to say things when you don’t ever imagine you will have to act on them.

The test was simple. A small phial of blood was taken and shipped off to a laboratory in the U.S.

When I went to collect my results several weeks later, I saw them before I heard them.

The report was on a table between the doctor and myself. Various markers had been analysed and I could see that next to BRCA1 it said 'deleterious'.

I hadn’t even heard of that word before that afternoon, let alone understood its meaning.

Now I know only too well.

Gaby plans to undergo a double mastectomy next month and possibly have her ovaries removed when she reaches 40

It means lying in bed at night, checking for breast lumps and living with the anxiety that the next lump you discover is going to be cancer.

It means going for yearly mammograms and bi-annual MRIs and ultrasounds and waiting nervously for the results.

The alternative is to undergo prophylactic surgery – the removal of both breasts and the ovaries to greatly reduce my chances of getting cancer.

Nearly everyone I told about my mutation seemed to think it was a no-brainer.

'I would have it done tomorrow,' was the stock response. 

I know that the people who said this had my best interests at heart, but would they really feel like that if they were in my position?

Admittedly, neither breasts nor ovaries are vital organs – I could easily survive without them.

They don’t help you walk, write or speak.

Yet, they are an intrinsic part of my identity - my sexuality and my sense of femininity.

When discussing the possibility of an oophorectomy at the age of 40 with my gynaecologist, I joked to him that it would 'complete the sex-change', while silently weeping inside.

My breasts and my ovaries have defined turning points in my life – the transitions from girlhood to adolescence, to womanhood and latterly to motherhood.

There is a cruel irony that something that creates and nurtures life so beautifully, can turn out to be the greatest threat to your own survival.

When I first heard the news I was a BRCA1 carrier, I told my husband that we needed to have another baby – and fast.

I had a strong desire to use these procreating parts of me one last time before they were swiped away on the operating table.

He reasoned with me, saying that my mutation was not a reason to have another child.

More importantly, I do need to stick around for the two beautiful children I already have.

So rather than spend the rest of my life anxiously waiting for cancer, which may or may not happen, I intend to reduce my chances drastically.

In the coming month, I plan to undergo a double mastectomy – with sizable reconstruction as my happy returns. I’ll have my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed at 40.

While my mum was right about many things, sadly her take on the family’s genetic makeup was incorrect.

We are a cancer family and will continue to be until someone discovers a cure.

In the meantime, I need to get on with trying to prevent it.
