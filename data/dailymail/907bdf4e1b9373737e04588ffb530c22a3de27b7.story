Australia's iconic brands such as Four'N Twenty, Vegemite and even the humble Anzac biscuit are coming under fierce attack on social media for producing Muslim-friendly halal-certified versions of their products.

The Facebook page 'Boycott Halal in Australia' has been set up and aims to 'boycott all companies and organisations that promote or use halal products and services.'

The page has  20,000 followers who claim that they will 'not buy halal products & services, because they fund Islamic expansion by any means'.

Four'N Twenty and the Byron Bay Cookie Company's Anzac biscuits are the latest to come under attack for introducing a halal certified range of foods. Vegemite and Milo have also come under social media attack for producing halal versions.

The much-love Australian iconic food brand Four N Twenty has sparked an outrage through social media over its' 'Halal certified' range

The official Four'N Twenty Facebook page is being bombarded with complaints for producing halal meat pies and sausage rolls. 

The number of complaints about their new halal foods has increased in recent months.

Four'N Twenty has even been forced to respond individually to some of the Facebook attacks.

The Australian pie company has said: 'Halal certified products are a small part of our range and are clearly labelled to ensure everyone can make an informed decision about which Four'N Twenty product is right for them.'

Among the consumers declaring they will boycott the company, a few have voiced their support for their decision to introduce halal products.

However, the overwhelming majority of Facebook users have been attacking the company's decision to sell halal products. 

One Perth user posted: 'I believe your company has bowed to Islamic pressure and now pay for your products to be halal certified...is this correct? If so, I will not be buying any of your companies products ever again!'

Milo consumers take to the official Facebook page to post against the halal certified products, while Milo has even taken to responding to some comments

Another wrote: 'You say less than 5% of your products are halal certified ..so does that make it ok that you're selling out to Islamic crap rot ..you are still supporting it an the cruelty to animals ..you have lost another customer an i will be letting all know what you have done ...not on ....'

One angry buyer even said the family would stop buying Four'N Twenty because it was selling halal certified products.

The Four'N Twenty 'Export' Sausage Roll and Meat Pie are certified Halal by the Australian Federation of Islamic Council.

The attacks on the Four'N Twenty halal range come despite the fact they are only being sold at specialty stores and produced for export.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Four'N Twenty for comment.

Meanwhile, the Northern Star reports the Byron Bay Cookie Company is seeking legal advice after consumers took to their official Facebook page to attack them for their halal Anzac biscuit range.

One Facebook user posted 'What a disgrace, the thousands of Anzacs that died on the beaches at Gallipoli will be turning in their graves.'

Another posted: 'No Byron Bay anything for me either. I stand firm on boycotting anything Halal. No food should be about religion. No law should be about religion.'

Facebook users have even accused Four N Twenty of supporting terrorism because they have launched a halal range of products

A spokesman from the Australian Food & Grocery Council told Daily Mail Australia that many Australian food manufacturers seek halal certification so their products can be enjoyed by Muslims and non-Muslims.

'In the same way that food labelled as vegan or gluten-free is suitable for consumption by a broad range of consumers, halal certified foods are commonly enjoyed by non-Muslims,' he said.

'Manufacturers pay for certification as a professional service, much like Kosher or organic accreditation, for example.

'Organisations who offer Halal certification services are subject to the same prohibitions on funding illegal entities and activity as any other organisation or individual under Australian law.'

Even Vegemite has come under attack for stocking halal certified products

Despite the negative complaints, many  customers have expressed their support for the range on Four'N Twenty's Facebook page:

One user posted: 'Going to have a pie party with my next pay check. What a bunch of legends!'

Another one wrote: 'Good onya Four N Twenty, for ignoring the ignorant bigots. Will go out of my way to buy your products now. You're awesome'

And another wrote: 'It makes sense to have your pies certified Halal, same as you would have them certified "Kosher" or "Heart Foundation" or "Gluten Free". Such a sensible idea. Australians need to know what they're eating. As long as your pies are still delicious, you have my support. And my custom.'

Despite the negative complaints, many others are showing their support for the halal certified Aussie meat pies

One user stood up for the range, and said 'boycott and you're the ones who'll miss out on a good ol' Aussie pie'

Another user wrote: 'Thank you for being a great Australian company! I love your pies...'

One user wrote: 'Good on you for responding so calmly to all the bigots posting negative things...'

Another user wrote: 'Just wanted to say, this Aussie family will now look specifically for your halal products'
