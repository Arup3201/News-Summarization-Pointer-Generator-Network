Most men dread being put in the dog house.

But one man has come up with a way to make a quick escape, by attaching a Boeing 502 engine to  a wooden dog hut.

The bizarre invention, created in Indianapolis, Indiana, can travel up to 75mph and shoots out 35ft flames from its 1,000 horsepower engine.

Need for speed: The dog house speeds along a race track in Indianapolis, Indiana, leaving a trail of flames and smoke in its wake

Paul Stender was left inspired after visiting a group of school children who shouted requests for a jet-powered dog house

Its creator, speed enthusiast Paul Stender, 48, was inspired to build the vehicle, which he has called Snoopy, after hearing requests from thrill-seeking school children. 

Mr Stender and his extreme sports entertainment team, Indy Boys Inc, were looking for their next idea after coming up with a jet-powered toilet and school bus. 

'We visit pupils at a lot of schools and we usually ask what they would like to see jet-powered and the dog house was one of the ideas mentioned.'

The innovative vehicle, which features a modified go-kart chassis, didn't take too long to put together, says Mr Stender, whose wife Therese, 29, helped with its construction.

'It was fairly quick to build compared to some of our other vehicles,' he said. 

Along with his team at Indy Boys Inc and wife, Therese, Mr Stender came up with the vehicle which has a top speed of 75mph

The thrill-seeking team's other creations include a jet-powered toilet and jet-powered schoolbus which reaches speeds of 367 mph

'We take it to air shows and we put on a 
show where I dress up as a dog and we do a funny cat and dog chase 
scene. The dog then takes off on top of the dog house.

'I'm always the one dressed as a the dog and it can be quite scary sitting on top of it, while it speeds down the track.

'Any time you hit a bump in the road, you risk flying off the top, which isn't a pleasant experience.'

'But its all good fun and the dog house has gone down really well with the public.'

The contraption's roof is set alight 'to add the jet fuel' according to Indy Boys Incorporated who make 'everything' jet-powered.

The driver sits on top of the roof using a set of make shift handle bars to control its direction while zooming around race tracks.

Mr Stender, from Big Bend, Wisconsin, is looking to break the world land speed record with his next venture, a converted Russian fighter jet from the Cold War.

The former motorbike and snowmobile racer plans to transform the aircraft into a land speed car which can reach 800mph.
