Doctors could save the NHS money by using internet services such as Skype to treat patients, legal advisers have said.

Video calling could reduce the number of missed GP appointments, the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland said in advice to doctors.

Patients in rural areas or those with disabilities could use Skype to talk to their GP ‘face-to-face’ without having to leave their own home.

The future? Doctors could use Skype to speak to patients in a bid to save the NHS money and reduce the number of missed GP appointments

The advice comes on the day the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has pledged that all patients in England will be able to order prescriptions and book GP appointments online by 2015. They may even be able to access crucial test results remotely.

Medical adviser Dr Barry Parker at the MDDUS said this could be taken further by using video conferencing.

He said: ‘The concept of holding consultations via Skype is an interesting development, which may have clear advantages in terms of convenience for patients and doctors.

‘Seeing your doctor in a safe and convenient way in the comfort of your own home may appeal to some patients.

‘Skype consultations may potentially be better than telephone advice calls, in that the patient can see who they are talking to, aiding communication, and the doctor can gain an overall impression of the patient’s condition.’

But he added: ‘The medico-legal pitfalls of Skype consultations are not yet fully apparent as it is a recent development, but it is anticipated that some of these will be similar to telephone advice.

‘The key issue for doctors will be to recognise when this mode of consultation is not sufficient to properly assess the patient and address the problem, and to arrange a face-to-face consultation instead.’

Guidance from the General Medical Council says doctors should examine the patient where necessary.
