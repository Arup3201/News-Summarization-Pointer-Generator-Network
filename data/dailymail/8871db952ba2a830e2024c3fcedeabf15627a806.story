The family of the man shot dead in full view of his young wife during a violent carjacking at an upscale New Jersey mall on Sunday night today demanded the death penalty for his nephew's killers.

Dustin Friedland, a 30-year-old lawyer from Hoboken, New Jersey, and his wife Jamie Schare Friedland, 27, were returning to their Range Rover in the car park at The Mall At Short Hills when he was fatally shot in the head and his assailants made their getaway in the $80,000 vehicle.

Jamie's uncle, Mark Schare, told Mail 
Online on Monday that he is certain Dustin would have turned over the keys to his
 Range Rover to the carjackers to avoid any sort of confrontation.

Dustin Friedland, 30, was returning with his wife Jamie to their Range Rover at The Mall At Short Hills on Sunday night when he was fatally shot

Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15

'I know him and he wouldn't resist,' Mark Schare told Mail Online. 'It’s not his nature. I know he wouldn't put up a fight.'

However reports emerging from local police are that Friedland did apparently struggle with his attackers shortly before his death, reports The Star-Ledger.

After shopping, the couple returned to their 
vehicle.

Friedland had opened the front door of 
the Range Rover for his wife, and was trying to enter the vehicle 
himself when he was approached by the two carjackers.

A
 struggle ensued, and several shots were fired, including the one that 
killed Friedland. Investigators believe the shooter 
used a handgun.

One of the attackers then entered the vehicle and ordered Friedland's wife out of the car at gunpoint.

Tragedy: Friedland and his wife Jamie, who married in 2011, had been looking forward to starting a family together in the near future

The
 two assailants then fled in the 2012 
silver Range Rover. It was followed by a speeding green Subaru that 
authorities said may have been the vehicle that brought the robbers 
there.

Mourning uncle Schare told Mail Online that whatever happens to bring the killers to justice, it won't bring back his nephew.

'It helps bring a conclusion but it's not going to take away the void.'

Instead, Friedland's uncle said the killer doesn't deserve to be spared.

'I hope they catch him and kill him.

'I'm not a violent person but this criminal doesn't deserve to breathe.'

Schare said he last saw Dustin Friedland at Thanksgiving when he and his wife seemed 'in good spirits.'

'They were starting a life together and they had a bright future. He loved my niece and took good care of her and was a very attentive and very good guy. Everybody liked him. I never heard a nasty thing come out of his mouth.'

Dustin Friedland, pictured with wife Jamie, was an intellectual property lawyer who had attended Syracuse University College of Law and Bucknell University

Despite earning his law degree and practicing - Schare said Friedland had selflessly decided to partner with his father's business.

'He studied as a lawyer but he wanted to help her father and work with him.

'That's him,' he said. 'That's the person he was.'

According to his LinkedIn social media profile, Friedland was a project manager who analyzed legal claims at a Neptune, New Jersey, contracting firm, Epic Mechanical, which is owned by his father, Wayne.

Records show the Range Rover was registered to the company.

Friedland and his wife had met while both law students at Syracuse University and had married in October 2011.

The couple were described as madly in love and planning to have their first kid, the wife's boss, Adam Leitman Bailey told The Daily News.

'She would just lighten up when he would walk in the room. She was so happy to be married,' said Bailey.

The couple's 2012 silver Range Rover was recovered in the southern part of Newark on Monday and authorities are still looking for the two men who shot Dustin Friedland

The silver Range Rover was recovered in the southern part of 
Newark on Monday morning and authorities
 are still looking for the two men.

‘We do not know why that car (was targeted), but it obviously was a car with some value,’ said Murray.

A local anti-crime organization is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to their arrest and conviction.

The thugs who shot and killed Friedland may be part of a stolen-car ring that’s targeted the tri-state area in recent months, according to law-enforcement officials.

An disclosed source told the New York Post that they weren’t surprised that the car had been ditched. He added that it was ‘rare for a carjacking to end with shots fired and killing someone. This is a violent crew.’

The shooting occurred at about 9:10 
p.m. and the New Jersey man was pronounced dead at 11:45 p.m. His wife 
was unharmed, although she was taken to a hospital for evaluation.

The
 posh shopping mall includes 160-stores and restaurants and is anchored 
by Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Macy's and 
Bloomingdale's. Other tenants include Cartier, Chanel, Tiffany & Co,
 and Gucci. It was open for extended holiday shopping hours on Sunday.

Panicked authorities briefly placed the 
mall on lockdown, which lasted for 30 minutes. Some shoppers could even 
hear the terrifying ordeal as it occurred on the garage’s third floor 
near Nordstrom.

Witness Robert Newman, 55, told the Star-Ledger he heard two gunshots at about 8:30 pm, and then saw a vehicle - though not the victim’s Range Rover - speed away.

‘The
 Subaru went out of here at about 100 miles per hour,’ said Newman, who 
described the vehicle as green. It was unclear if the Subaru he saw was 
connected to the crime.

Another man who was in the mall and working in one of its restaurants said he heard multiple shots as well.

‘The table in the back stood up really fast,’ the restaurant worker told CBS New York.
 ‘They started panicking. I peeked my head out of this door right here, 
and I heard a lady screaming on the top of her lungs, screaming some 
name.’

Millburn Mayor Sandra Haimoff said the shooting was of grave concern, reports NJ.com.

'Our
 police department is out there and I’m sure they’re doing everything 
that needs to be done. But it is upsetting and it’s unfortunate that 
this happened,' she said.
