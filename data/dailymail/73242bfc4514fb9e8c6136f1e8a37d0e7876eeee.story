Michael Carrick has backed David Moyes to prove a success at Real Sociedad and wished his former Manchester United manager good will.

Moyes endured a torrid reign in charge of United and was sacked after 10 months as the club fell from champions under Sir Alex Ferguson to seventh in the Premier League. 

But he is set to restart his career in La Liga and Carrick, who played 40 games for Moyes, said: ‘I am pleased to see him back in the game. I wish him all the best.

'I hope it goes great for him over there. It's a new challenge for him. He has proven with his track record over the years that he has been successful over such a long period of time.

'He will be frustrated with how things went last year as we all were but I am sure he will bounce back. Hopefully he can over there and do well.’ 

Carrick is making a comeback of sorts also, looking to earn his first England cap since October 2013 after missing out on last summer’s World Cup. Retirements by Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard mean the 33-year-old is the eldest member of the squad, but he is targeting Euro 2016 and beyond.

'Of course,' he said. 'I don't think this is my last season. The longer your career goes on, the more you appreciate things. You do start seeing the end and that's natural but I am enjoying things at the moment and I feel good.

'Hopefully I do have a few years left still. I want to make the most of the opportunity now. It's great to be back now especially after the start of the season.' 

He admits he is frustrated not have won more than 31 England caps and he was disappointed Roy Hodgson failed to take him to Brazil but added: 'I am not complaining about it. I would have loved to have played more games for England but that's not really happened. At the moment I want to make the most of what is happening ahead.

'This is playing for your country. You have the best to choose from. We are fortunate we have had some special players over the years in midfield. It was frustrating. I wish I could have played more but there is no point looking back. I have to look forward and make most of the time I have left.’

Michael Carrick has revealed his brother Graeme was a better player than Wayne Rooney in their younger days. 'I first heard of Wayne when my brother played against him in the Youth Cup,’ said Carrick. 'Wayne was at Everton, Graeme was at West Ham. That was the first time my brother told me about him.

'He said he had the better of him, actually! He said he was going to be a special player, he could tell that then.

‘The goal against Arsenal was the one, that propelled Wayne into everyone's minds. Everyone saw what he was about. Ever since then you can't get rid of him!’
