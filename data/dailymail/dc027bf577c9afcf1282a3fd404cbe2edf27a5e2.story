A Christian missionary who allegedly tried to wrestle the controls from a young pilot mid-air, forcing an emergency landing, is a well-travelled pilot with 50 years of experience.

Les Nixon, 82, is recovering in hospital after a 23-year-old pilot was forced to subdue him when he allegedly grabbed the controls of the four-seater Duchess light aircraft as they were flying over the Blue Mountains in NSW.

A friend of Mr Nixon told Daily Mail Australia that his erratic behaviour was totally out of character and could offer no explanation why he would allegedly try and ditch the plane.

Pilot James Chandler told police Mr Nixon started switching off fuel lines and pushing control buttons, forcing an emergency landing near Oberon, west of the Blue Mountains, on Monday afternoon.

'I can't even imagine what would have happened in that plane. It certainly comes as a surprise,' Mr Nixon's friend of 40 years, Phil Lamb, told Daily Mail Australia.

'It would have been very out of character for him to do anything that wasn't professional.'

Pilot James Chandler, 23, had to make an emergency landing after an 82-year-old passenger allegedly switched off the fuel lines over the Blue Mountains in NSW on Monday

Les Nixon, pictured here with his wife Martha, was a Christian missionary with more than 50 years of flying experience. He was charged by police late on Wednesday following an investigation

Mr Nixon has been flying for 50 years to isolated corners of Australia as part of the Christian outreach program he started with his wife Martha, Australia's Outback Patrol.

'That Duchess he flew was his favourite plane. He knew that Duchess (plane) inside and out,' Mr Lamb said.

'He used to hire a twin engine out of Bankstown to maintain currency so that means he would have been familiar with every switch inside,' Mr Lamb said.

A dramatic recording of the cockpit emergency revealed audio of the pilot struggling with Mr Nixon in the light plane as they flew over the Blue Mountains.

'Pan pan pan pan pan, bravo foxtrot papa, bravo foxtrot papa, my passenger is trying to take over,' Mr Chandler shouts into the aircraft's speaker, according to an Air Traffic Control recording obtained by the Nine Network.

Mr Nixon, the sole passenger on the flight, had allegedly reached over to switch off the fuel supply to the plane's single engine and then tried to take control of the joystick, causing Mr Chandler to shout 'We... whoah, whoah. My passenger's taking... the engines.'

Mr Nixon had chartered the flight - allegedly his first on a light plane - from Australian By Air to take him from the NSW Central Coast over the Blue Mountains to Cowra, 350km to the south-west.

Mr Chandler punched Mr Nixon repeatedly in the face to subdue him, breaking the 82-year-old's nose.

At the same time the pilot - who has just two years' flying experience - managed to shut off the craft's mechanics and glide it down at about 3pm on Monday into a flat paddock run with sheep on a property known as Bloomfield, near Oberon.

Mr Lamb said he couldn't comment on his friend's health during the mid-air incident.

'He’s getting medical assessments and I guess when those are available, more will be discovered of his physical condition,' he said.

'Obviously, there’s speculation about what’s happened. But unless someone else was on board, it’s impossible for us to understand.

'There’s two sides to the story. There’s a young pilot who is relatively inexperienced and a pilot who has been flying for 50 years. Whether there has been a miscommunication, I guess that will be revealed in investigation.'

NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia they were waiting for doctors at Westmead Hospital to clear Mr Nixon, who was admitted for facial injuries, so they could interview him and learn whether he meant to take control of the plane or whether he just panicked.

'The pilot's done really well to land the plane safely,' a NSW police officer said, 'with this bloke fiddling with the controls. It could have been much worse, a real disaster.'

Australia By Air CEO, David Trevelyan, who said the elderly man was a first time customer with his company, told Nine News Mr Chandler's flying skills were paramount in avoiding a crash.

'I would like to praise the actions of the pilot. He showed fantastic skill,' Mr Trevelyan said.

'He did an excellent job in an amazingly difficult scenario ... and under tremendous pressure.'

Mr Chandler was treated briefly in hospital before being released.

Mr Nixon had headed the Australia's Outback Patrol program with his wife Martha since 1961.

'He was a lovely, fine man. He has had a 50 years long carer serving other people. He started a mission whose aim was to use the plane in isolated communities,' Mr Lamb said.
