A dazzling conjunction of Jupiter and Venus will be visible on Monday morning, shortly before sunrise in the UK. A 2012 conjunction over Canada is pictured

A dazzling conjunction of Jupiter and Venus will provide an impressive light show on Sunday night and Monday morning. 

The two brightest planets in the sky will form a spectacular 'double star', hanging low on the north-eastern horizon.

This will be visible shortly before sunrise at around 5am BST (midnight EST) and will appear only 0.2 degrees apart - less than half the width of a little finger held out at arm's length. 

A number of similar conjunctions were captured in 2012, but this will be the closest and brightest conjunction of the two planets since 2000.

Experts believe their combined brightness and low position in the sky could keep switchboards busy with reports of UFOs.

Robin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: 'They will be so close together that it's going to be quite a striking sight.

'Undoubtedly people could mistake them for a UFO, especially being so low down. 

'They might appear to move around because of the distortion effect of the atmosphere.'

Although the planets appear to be kissing-distance apart, as seen from the Earth, they are actually separated by hundreds of millions of miles.

Venus and Jupiter pair up about once a year on average, but their conjunctions vary greatly in separation and visibility. Some are missed completely because they occur in daylight.

The next Venus-Jupiter conjunction is due to occur on June 30 next year, but will be less close.

During Monday's conjunction, Venus will appear six times brighter than Saturn, even though its diameter is less than a tenth that of the larger planet, which measures 86,881 miles (139,821km) across.

The planets' combined brightness and low position in the sky could keep switchboards busy with reports of UFOs in the early hours of Monday morning.

Robin Scagell, vice-president of the Society for Popular Astronomy, said: 'They will be so close together that it's going to be quite a striking sight.

'Undoubtedly people could mistake them for a UFO, especially being so low down. 

'They might appear to move around because of the distortion effect of the atmosphere.'

That is because Venus is much closer to the Earth and also nearer the sun, causing its clouds to be lit more intensely.

A pair of binoculars will heighten the conjunction experience, but even a small telescope should provide a dramatic view.

Venus will mimic a tiny full moon, while Jupiter will appear three times wider. 

Jupiter will also be accompanied by its four brightest moons strung out in a row.

Ideally the conjunction should be seen from a high unobstructed vantage point.

'People who have buildings, hills or trees in the way might miss it, but even a roof top in London should offer a good view,' said Mr Scagell.
