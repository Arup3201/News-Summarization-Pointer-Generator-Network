A cat has walked away unscathed from a 26-storey tower fall after it crashed through a canvas tent roof beneath its owner's apartment.

Jommi, an 18-year-old cat from Hong Kong, had been playing in owner Al Ling's flat when he went into the kitchen to make her some food.

But when he returned a few minutes later, Jommi had gone.

Jommi, 18-months-old, was playing in her owner's Hong Kong flat when she fell out the open window

She fell 26 storeys from the window of this downtown Hong Kong apartment block, but miraculously walked away unscathed

He said: 'We went into the other room for a few minutes and shortly after when I came out calling for her, I was looking everywhere and could not find her.

'We had left a little window crack open to get some fresh air and I suddenly had the horrific thought that she may have gotten through the gap.'

Going over to the window, he looked outside and could not believe his eyes.

He said: 'I looked over and saw a large hole in a tent 26-storeys below, and I knew she had gone over.'

Jumping into the lift, Ling hurtled downstairs and ran outside to see if Jommi was still alive.

He said: 'I really did fear the worst and was convinced I would find her dead.

'The force of her impact was so great it had bent the tent's aluminium frame so you can imagine my utter shock when I went inside and found her licking her paws as if nothing had happened.'

Owner Al Ling said he was convinced he would find Jommi (pictured) dead after she fell from the window

Despite falling 26 storeys, her fall was cushioned by a tent roof, which was left torn and bent (pictured) from the impact of her landing

Stunned Ling then took her back upstairs and closed the window.

He said: 'I remember seeing a QI programme once where they talked about a cat's low terminal velocity when falling from great heights and that the higher the fall the more likely the survival.

'Whatever the reason, Jommi is going to be the most spoilt cat in history now.'
