Blue skies dawned over much of the UK today as the country dusted itself off after the most intense September rainstorms in more than 30 years.

Two dog-walkers drowned in a swollen river and hundreds of properties were flooded as torrential downpours battered the country last week.

But the respite from the wet weather is not expected to last, as forecasters predicted more 'persistent' rainfall from tomorrow and issued a warning for the North West of the country.

While much of the UK enjoyed dry, sunny conditions today, forecasters at the Met Office described an 'unsettled' week to come, bringing more heavy rain, cooler temperatures and the possibility of frost overnight.

Met Office spokeswoman Helen Roberts said: 'We will see a real change between today and tomorrow.

'Tomorrow could be some quite persistent and heavy rain.'

She said the Met Office had issued a yellow warning in the north west of the country ahead of further anticipated downpours.

'Because of what happened last week any more rain could cause some problems,' she said.

The spokeswoman said the week ahead would feel cooler, with temperatures slightly below average for the time of year.

'It's look largely unsettled, there will be some bright and sunny spells in parts, but the risk of showers in much of the rest of the UK...perhaps heavy at times,' she said.

'It is very typical autumn weather.'

Last week at least 400 properties in the North, the South West, the Midlands and the East were flooded as intense rainstorms swept the country.

Alicia Williams and her fiance David Platt, both 25, drowned in the swollen River Clywedog near Wrexham, North Wales, on Wednesday.

It is thought the couple drowned after entering the swollen river to try and rescue one of their dogs from the fast-flowing water following heavy rainfall.
