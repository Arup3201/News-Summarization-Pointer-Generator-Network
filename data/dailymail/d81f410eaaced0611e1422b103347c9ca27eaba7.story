A teenage girl has been arrested for baring all at a Catholic school to take revenge on the bullies who were 'mean' to her there.

Valerie Dodds, 19, decided she wanted to pursue a career in adult entertainment but was mocked by former classmates at  St Pius X High School in Nebraska.

'It looked like something that I just kind of wanted to try, I guess,' she said.

Miss Dodds, who uses the name Val Midwest, started a website with nude photos of herself for fun but claims her classmates didn't like it, KETV Omaha reported.

'That's when all the Pius kids were saying mean things and that's when I decided to go there and show them that I'm here to stay,' she said.

Miss Dodds was photographed nude on the football field in front of the Catholic school’s motto – 'Restore all things in Christ' – in May.

But the student, who graduated from Lincoln East High School, only received a ticket for trespassing and public nudity when she returned to pose in her underwear last week.

Miss Dodds said she's considering another photo shoot in pasties and panties - this time in front of the Lancaster County Courthouse

The school released a statement saying it would continue to notify authorities if Miss Dodds did something illegal.

'More important to us, however, is that we constantly follow our school's motto,' the statement read.

'To that end, we are praying for the young lady and her family, and we stand ready to offer forgiveness and support should she seek it.'

Miss Dodds has told KETV Omaha that she's considering another photo shoot in pasties and panties - this time in front of the Lancaster County Courthouse.
