It may have only been on sale for weeks, but online rumours claim Apple is about to begin making the successor to the iPhone 5, believed to be called the iPhone 5S.

A Chinese site claims the firm is set to begin trial production of the new model next month, although has no details of what new features it may contain.

The Commercial Times estimates that full commercial production of the rumoured iPhone 5S will begin as early as Q1 2013, with the December run only expected to return between 50,000 and 100,000 units.

Apple's iPhone 5, which went on sale on September 29th. However, reports today claim a new version could begin production within a month and go on sale next year.

'Facing low yield rates in the production of iPhone 5, Apple has accelerated the certification processes for related parts and components for the iPhone 5S, the paper revealed, according to DigiTimes.

'While the speculated iPhone 5S is expected to enter volume production in the first quarter of 2013, Apple is also likely to release a new version of iPad a quarter later than the iPhone 5S, since the display resolution of its latest version of iPad has come out lower than expected,' the paper said.

However, while the firm may begin trial production, some believe it may not go on sale until later next year.

'The industry was surprised at how quickly the iPad 4 replaced the 3, however that was to make all of its top line products have the same connector,' said Luke Peters, editor of T3 magazine.

'Trial production might see we see snippets on the web, but its usually 6-7 months until we see a launch, and so I would expect to see a new version, be it an iPhone 5S or a 6, late next year.'

Customers queue outside the Apple Store in Covent Garden, London, as the new iPhone 5 goes on sale. now rumours say a new version go begin trial production within weeks.

It comes as Samsung's Galaxy S3 has become the world's best-selling smartphone model for the last quarter, pushing aside Apple's iPhone.

Apple has dominated the chart for more than two years, research firm Strategy Analytics said.

It claims Samsung sold 18 million S3 models in the third quarter, compared with iPhone 4S sales of 16.2 million.

Strong sales of the flagship Galaxy S3
- which comes with a large 4.8 inch touchscreen - helped Samsung post a
record $7.3 billion operating profit in the July-September quarter.

Apple
customers were also believed to be waiting for the release of the 
iPhone 5, which is expected to propel Apple back to the top spot.
