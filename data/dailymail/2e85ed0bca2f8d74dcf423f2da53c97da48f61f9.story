Ebola free: Ashoka Mukpo's battle against Ebola officially ended Tuesday as the NBC cameraman tested negative for the deadly virus for the third consecutive day

 Soon to go home: Mukpo tweeted the good news Tuesday as he prepared to leave a biocontainment unit on Wednesday

The Nebraska Medical Center said Tuesday afternoon that Ashoka Mukpo's blood tested negative for the virus. He will be allowed to leave a biocontainment unit Wednesday.

Mukpo said in a statement that recovering from Ebola 'is a truly humbling feeling.'

For the second day in a row, Mukpo heaped on the praise, thanks and answers to questions so many have had since he was admitted to the specially-equipped ward October 6 after contracting Ebola in Liberia.

'I fought and won, with lots of help. Amazing feeling,' he gushed. The knowledge that there's no more virus in my blood is a profound relief. I'm so lucky. Wish everyone who got sick could feel this.'

Mukpo made sure to acknowledge his fellow Americans still fighting their battles against Ebola.

Where the struggle began: The freelance journalist from Rhode Island, was working as a cameraman for NBC in Liberia. His jet landed on Monday in Maine for refueling before continuing to Nebraska where he will be treated in a specialized bio-containment unit

Someone to go home to: Mr Mukpo and his girlfriend Helen have been together for four years and spent two living in Liberia

'Still thinking about those nurses. Look forward to the day you two get news like this too...,' he wrote before signing off Tuesday evening.

Not long before, the NIH announced that Pham's condition had been updated to good from fair.

The 26-year-old's condition had evidently briefly worsened to fair as she arrived at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, late Thursday.

Pham is one of two nurses in Dallas who became infected with Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the disease October 8.

The other nurse, Amber Vinson, is being treated at Emory University in Atlanta.

Doing better: Hours before Ashoka's tweets, infected Dallas nurse Nina Pham's condition was upgraded from fair to good

When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama.

Mr Mukpo later traveled to Tibet, where he was enthroned and honored as the ninth reincarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, 'the Mad Yogi of Kham.'

A further twist in the cameraman's life: Trungpa, who is considered his father, is not his biological dad. His biological father is actually Mitchell Levy - a Jewish doctor from New York who was Trungpa's personal physician - whom his mother Lady Diana Mukpo was sleeping with at the time.

The 33-year-old Mr Mukpo remains a Buddhist. But, despite his wild family history and divine lineage, he has rejected the path of a monk. Instead, he chose a life working for nonprofits and has said his calling is to help alleviate suffering in the world.

After his father Trungpa died in 1987, his mother married his biological father, Dr Levy and moved to quiet suburban Providence, Rhode Island.

Mr Mukpo's father was a hard-drinking, womanizing Buddhist luminary who founded the first Buddhist monastery in the West and taught the likes of Davie Bowie, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Joni Mitchell in the 1960s and 70s.

Chögyam Trungpa was known for his wild, hedonistic Tantric parties that were fueled by drugs, booze and sex. He frequently seduced and slept with his students - claiming that it would help them on their path to enlightenment.

He died at age 48 in 1987 from complications from extreme alcoholism after founding the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery in Galloway, Scotland, and the Shambhala Mountain Center outside Boulder, Colorado.

His mother is Lady Diana Judith Mukpo, born Diana Pybus, the daughter of a wealthy London lawyer.

She attended Benenden School, an all-girl's boarding school in Kent, England, where she is thought to have been a contemporary of Princess Anne and Baroness Manningham-Buller, former Director General of MI5.

In December 1968, aged 15 and on her Christmas break from Benenden, Diana met 28-year-old Chögyam Mukpo, or Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche as he was known as a lama, at the Buddhist Society in London’s Eccleston Square.

In the documentary Tulku, she recalled the first time she laid eyes on the monk, saying: 'I felt like I'd known him for lifetimes. Just immediate, instantaneous lifetime connection. and the rest is history.'

She later sneaked out of her boarding school stole into his hotel room that night. She later recalled that she had been hoping that she would end up in bed with him when she introduced herself. 

Trungpa, who had been having sex since age 13, obliged.

Trungpa had traveled to Britain in 1963 on a scholarship to study at Oxford University after fleeing the Chinese occupation of Tibet, and shortly before meeting Diana, he had been teaching David Bowie about Buddhism.

In 1970, Diana, just 16 and the Tibetan guru, aged 30, ran away to Scotland to marry.

The sensational story of the lawyer's teenage daughter who ran away to marry a monk nearly twice her age became front page news.
