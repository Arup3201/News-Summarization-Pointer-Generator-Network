Saido Berahino is the only top flight Englishman to match Harry Kane’s tally of 10 goals for club and country this season. One is being tipped for an England call-up, the other curiously isn’t.

But after a hat-trick on Thursday night in Tottenham’s thumping 5-1 win over Asteras Tripolis, Kane has set his sights on Roy Hodgson’s squad.

With England’s European Championship qualifying group looking tediously straightforward, Hodgson could surprise a few with his selection process over the next year. If he needs a centre forward, West Brom frontman Berahino shouldn’t be the only one on his radar.

Kane, whose fantastic performance was nearly outshone by a stunning ‘rabona’ strike from Erik Lamela on Thursday, has one target. But the 21-year-old is still typically grounded.

‘[England] is obviously where I want to get to, that’s the aim, the senior squad,’ he said.

‘But I’ve just got to keep concentrating on my club football and trying to score, and if I do well in time I’ll get the chance.’

But just seven Premier League starts under his belt and 24 in all competitions makes him a raw yet inexperienced talent.

But he only has to look across the Spurs dressing room at Andros Townsend for an example of England taking a chance on inexperience.

The winger had played 23 times in the Premier League before he was picked in Hodgson’s squad last October, scoring on his debut.

Kane is desperate to replicate Townsend’s path.

‘He did very well, he got his games, played well, and got his reward. Hopefully if I keep doing what I’m doing, that can be the future.

‘But I think Under 21 football is important, especially international. We’ve done great with that, I’m looking forward to Euro 2015.’

The next big step for Kane is becoming a regular starter in the top flight under Mauricio Pochettino. There have been none this season, the Argentine instead preferring Emmanuel Adebayor or Roberto Soldado.

Kane, who can play as a lead striker, second striker or on the wing, is aware the top flight is where his name will be made. He’ll be wondering what else he needs to do if he doesn’t start against Newcastle at White Hart Lane on Saturday.

‘Obviously the Premier League is the top league in the world and that’s what everyone is watching and that’s where you want to hit your goals.

‘But every time I get the chance I have to do what I can, as many goals as I can.’
