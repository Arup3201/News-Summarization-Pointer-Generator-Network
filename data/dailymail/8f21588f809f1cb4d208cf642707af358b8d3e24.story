Almost three months after she lost the ability walk after an horrific ATV accident left her paralyzed from the waist down, Olympic swimmer Any Van Dyken-Rouen has taken her first steps on bionic legs.

Van Dyken-Rouen, 41, severed her spine when an ATV rolled on top of her after it flipped over an embankment near the home she shares with her husband, former Denver Broncos player Tom Rouen, near their home in Show Lo, Arizona on June 6.

Soon after the accident, she appeared on the Today Show and vowed she would walk again - and on Thursday, she did.

Unwavering: Amy van Dyken-Rouen stated after her accident that she was determined to walk again

The six-time gold medalist has been working tirelessly at rehab and has documented her journey on social media.

She has been unwaveringly positive about her prospects of walking again, and today she posted pictures and video of herself taking her very first post-accident steps.

Deadspin reports that Van Dyken-Rouen was able to stand and walk for the first time using a powered orthosis, or exoskeleton.

It's a remarkable advance in such a short period of time since her accident.

The case was so serious that she and Rouen said their goodbyes before she went to surgery.

Elite athlete: Van Dyken-Rouen's steely determination to walk again mirrors the resolve that netted her six Olympic gold medals in 1996 and 2000 

She told him to move on and be happy in his life, while he said he understood if she needed to leave him.

'One of the things that I told her was if... all this was too much and she wanted to go, she could go, and I'd understand,' Rouen recounted to Matt Lauer on the Today show.

However, Van Dyken-Rouen is made of steelier stuff.

She won six gold medals at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics.

She posted pictures of her standing next to her husband for the first time in 11 weeks.

She also managed to stand next to her husband for the first time in two-and-a-half months.

'Who’s excited to be walking around with an exoskeleton?' Van Dyken-Rouen tweeted Thursday. 'This chick!'
