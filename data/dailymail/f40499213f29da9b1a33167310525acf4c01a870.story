A man nicknamed 'Insane Shane' shoved magazines down his pants to protect his genitals before his friend shot him in a Jackass-style prank that went wrong.

Michael Dominic Ciantar apologised on Friday at Adelaide Magistrates Court after he pleaded guilty to discharging a firearm to injure, annoy or frighten at a Brahma Lodge party last week.

The 20-year-old man fired off an air rifle at Shane Lewis on February 27.

Michael Dominic Ciantar, 20, has pleaded guilty to discharging a firearm to injure, annoy or frighten

Ciantar was arrested after Mr Lewis, 41, arrived at Lyell McEwin hospital with a gunshot wound to his arm.

'I will never do anything that stupid again,' the Brahma Lodge said.

'I have always been a very respectful person with my firearms, as it has always been one of my passions.

'I know I have stuffed up.'

Initially police were told Lewis had been injured in a drive-by shooting as witnesses and the victim would not co-operate.

But prosecutor Lisa Lakatos said the incident was captured on video by an onlooker on Ciantar's mobile phone.

The Brahma Lodge man discharged a firearm in a Jackass-style stunt that went wrong and ended with friend Shane Lewis being shot in the arm

Ciantar's lawyer, Stephen Ey, said Mr Lewis had bragged about pranks on the TV show Jackass - including putting yabbies on nipples and using guns to shoot at one another.

The lawyer said he had done an internet search on Jackass pranks and discovered 'all sorts of bizarre behaviour'.

Mr Lewis had suggested Ciantar go home and get his slug gun, which his client did.

'Lewis wanted the defendant to shoot him in the arm,' Mr Ey said.

'The defendant suggested it would be better if it was in the bottom, but ultimately it was agreed he would shoot him in the arm.'

He will re-appear in court for sentencing on August 5 - he is facing an eight-year jail sentence

Mr Lewis put magazines down his pants to protect his genitalia.

Prosecutors previously said Ciantar then asked Mr Lewis's teenage son, 'Do you want to see your dad being shot?'

Mr Ey said the incident was filmed because they did not contemplate any harm would be done, but wanted to prove the shooting took place.

After being shot, Mr Lewis did some push-ups but after blood was noticed on his arm about 20 minutes later, Ciantar convinced him to go to hospital.

Ciantar will be sentenced on August 5. Adelaide Now reported the 20-year-old was allowed to continue on bail and faced an eight-year jail sentence.
