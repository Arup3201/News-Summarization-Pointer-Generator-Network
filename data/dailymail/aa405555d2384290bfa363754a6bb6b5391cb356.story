Newly-released recordings show Captain Schettino deliberately misinformed passengers and the coastguard to the extent of the Concordia disaster

The disgraced captain of the Costa Concordia told his passengers that the doomed cruise ship had simply suffered a 'power cut' moments after it had hit a reef and begun to sink.Â 

The disaster off the Italian Island of Giglio in January this year claimed the lives of 32 passengers including a five-year-old girl.

Recordings retrieved from the ship's 'black box' show how Captain Francesco Schettino deliberately misinformed both the passengers and the Italian coastguard to the true extent of the accident.

Seconds after the collision at 9.45pm he is heard saying: 'Madonna what have I done?'

He then calls down to the engine room and asks: 'Are we really going down?'

But three minutes later at 9.54, he instructs an officer on the bridge to tell passengers 'there has been a blackout'.

And at 10.02pm he calls the Italian coastguard saying: 'We've had a blackout, we're just evaluating... at most we're going to need a tugboat.'

He continued to resist calls from his
officers to abandon the ship until 11.19pm.

Capt Schettino escaped the 1,000 ft liner before all the passengers had been evacuated and later told magistrates he had 'tripped' into a life boat.

As the evacuation of the 4,200 
passengers and crew was under way, he telephoned his wife, Fabiola, to 
say everything was 'under control'.

'We hit a reef, the ship is listing but I performed a great manoeuvre ... everything is under control.'

But in a subsequent phone call he told her: 'My career as a captain is over.'

Captain Francesco Schettino told the Italian 
coastguard: 'We've had a blackout, we're just evaluating... at 
most we're going to need a tugboat.'

Sunk: The captain crashed the luxury liner into rocks, then claimed he accidentally escaped prematurely by 'tripping' into a life boat

In his own account of the fateful night he claimed that his 
sailing know-how and 'intuition', abetted by divine intervention, had 
caused him to change course at the last moment - and prevent a much 
greater loss of life.

'At 
that moment a divine hand definitely landed on my head,' he said. 'If I 
had continued on that route, we would have hit the rock with the bow. It
would have been a massacre.'

The black box recordings were obtained by the Italian La Stampa newspaper.

Abandoned: Sun loungers are piled up next to the water chute on the stricken liner, lying partly submerged off the west coast of Italy in January

Dangerous: The Costa Concordia ran into trouble after sailing too close to the tiny Tuscan island of Giglio, Italy

The 52-year-old is facing charges 
including multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship ahead of his passengers
and failing to communicate with maritime authorities. following the 
disaster.

He has been accused of deliberately misleading the Coast Guard and the ships owners of the true extent of the disaster.

They say he was sailing the huge 
vessel dangerously close to the little island of Giglio on the evening 
of 13 January, when it slammed in to a reef.
