The body of an elderly woman who was mysteriously murdered along with her husband last year was weighed down with cement blocks before it was thrown into a Georgia lake, it has emerged.

Shirley and Russell Dermond, who had been married 62 years, were both killed at their Lake Oconee home the weekend of May 2, 2014 - but police still do not know who was responsible.

Neighbors, concerned they had not seen the couple, went to their home on May 6 and found Mr Dermond's decapitated body in their garage. His wife was nowhere to be seen.

Her body was eventually found on May 16 by fishermen at a lake, about five miles away by water from their waterfront home.

Killed: Shirley and Russell Dermond were killed at their Lake Oconee, Georgia home last May and their killer has still not been found. Mr Dermond was decapitated while Mrs Dermond's body was dumped in a lake

Police have long said they do not believe the killer or killers wanted Mrs Dermond's body to be found and, speaking to WSB-TV, they said it is because her body had been weighed down by the blocks.

She had two four-inch cap blocks on her body, but the killers must not have anticipated the effect of decomposing gases beneath the skin, which make a body more buoyant. 

Police have tried to find where the blocks were bought but unfortunately they're 'as common as ketchup,' Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills told WSB-TV.

Still, the body has given them potentially significant evidence that can be checked against a suspect when one is found.

Heartbreaking: The body of Mrs Dermond was weighed down with cement blocks before it was dumped

'(There's) a lot more to work with when you have the body,' said FBI Special Agent Steve Emmett. 'Whatever Putnam feels that they need from the FBI, we will be there for them.'  

The case has baffled police, relatives and members of the quiet community.

Autopsies showed that the couple died of head wounds, but it is not known how they were attacked, by whom or why. Mr Putnam's head remains missing.

No one reported hearing any commotion over the weekend they are believed to have died. Nothing was taken from their $1 million home and their car keys and cellphones were left behind.

Video cameras at the guard house at the entrance to the subdivision weren't working, and it is possible the killer came by boat. The 19,000-acre lake offered countless entry and escape routes.

Bizarre: Nothing had been stolen from the couple's $1 million waterfront home and no commotion was heard

Escape route: The killer or killers likely escaped on the water after the May 2014 attack

While investigators scoured the Dermond house and areas around it for evidence in the days after the grisly discovery, whatever they collected has yet to render a clue.

Russell Dermond, 88, had retired from corporate life - much of it with clockmaking companies - in the late 1980s to run a chain of Atlanta-area Hardee's restaurants. 

About 15 years ago, he and his wife, Shirley, 87, moved to Lake Oconee to live out their years in the golf-course community in a waterfront home. 

The 3,200-square-foot, $1 million home sits in a tree-shrouded cul-de-sac in the Great Waters subdivision, a dozen or so miles northeast of Eatonton.
