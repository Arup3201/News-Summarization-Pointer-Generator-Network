The Sunday Telegraph reports that Anthony Puharich will sell the prized cuts from Vic’s Meat Market in Pyrmont and Victor Churchill butchery in Woollahra.

Victor Churchill’s Woollahra store sold all of its sirloin after just four hours into the first day of sale, adding up to about 20kg.

'This one it hit the mark in every way shape and form,' head butcher Dennis O’Rourke said.

Wagyu breeder David Blackmore and son Ben produce the high quality meat. 

They confirm that the carcass is the progeny of exceptional bloodlines and its origins can be traced back to Japan’s most famous cow - Kikutsuru from the Hyogo Prefecture, home of Kobe beef.

Wagyu beef is generally best eaten as thinly sliced carpaccio

Once processed at a slaughterhouse in Packenham, Victoria, the animal was tested, between the 10th and 11th rib, and the one-off quality identified.

It also had the highest scores in all of the measurements of quality including, marbling, meat and fat colour.

As far as its quality goes the Aizakura Wagyu beef is comparable to Japanese A5 Wagyu which is the highest grade achievable. This is only ever given to the finest beef in Japan with a score of 11.
