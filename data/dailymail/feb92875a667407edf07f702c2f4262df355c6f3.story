Females may be the fairer sex, but it seems that men like looking at themselves more, taking almost double the number of selfies that women do.

This trend has arisen because men see showing off using a smartphone as 'acceptable vanity', according to a psychologist.

The general obsession with selfies, however, is affecting Brits' life experiences.

Vanity: Men taking double the number of selfies than women, according to a Samsung survey

 

Selfie was recently named the word of 2013, beating tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming.

Editors
 from Oxford Dictionaries, which made it their Word of 2013, said the 
word has evolved from a niche social media tag into a mainstream term 
for a self-portrait photograph.

One
 of the most famous selfies this year was the Pope posing with teenagers
 at the Vatican. The picture went viral on social media and was widely 
speculated as being the first ever 'Papal selfie'.

A third admit they’ve missed a great 
live moment because they were taking a snap of themselves, according to a
 survey of 2,000 people.

Experiences
 are also being missed out on by Brits’ eagerness to upload selfies to 
social media sites – so everyone else can see their good looks.

Over half (52 per cent) of the respondents for the study, commissioned by Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom, admitted that they uploaded photos from their smartphones immediately to their social media profiles.

Some selfies are known as ‘braggies’ – and are designed purely to show off or make friends jealous, according to a Hotels.com study published recently.

The poll found that 5.4 million people in the UK post these bragging photos within 10 minutes of arriving on holiday, for example, as well as of hotel rooms, in bars and nightclubs and even of their bed.

Men’s selfie-obsession stems from the fact that it’s an acceptable form of vanity, according to behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings.

She told MailOnline: ‘Selfies are modern day vanity. Men have come to the vanity game later than women. They’re taking selfies because there’s a technological aspect to them, so they see it as a more acceptable way of revealing their vanity.’

The men who have a handle on technology should perhaps remind smartphone users that their devices can also make calls, as well as take photographs.

While around 35million selfies are taken by Brits a month, according to a recent HTC survey, Samsung’s research shows that just 26 per cent of Brits admit to only ever dialling friends and family on their devices.

Paul Scott, Head of Product Marketing Digital Imaging, Samsung Electronics UK, said: 'The explosion of social media and the expansion of 4G has meant that more people are sharing photos of their lives with the rest of the world than ever before, and naturally, they are taking to their smartphones to help capture the perfect shot.

'The Galaxy S4 Zoom was designed with this in mind -  thanks to its Wi-Fi connectivity, it’s possible to take great photos and share them instantly with others.'
