Republican primary voters have sent a big message to their presidential candidates - they want Rick Perry, but Sarah Palin can forget running.

Former Texas governor Mr Perry has moved into the lead with the backing of 26 per cent of GOP primary voters, according to a Fox News poll.

But 74 per cent of voters think former Alaska governor Mrs Palin should stay out of the race to take on President Barack Obama in 2012.

Mr Perry has gained 13 points in three weeks to grab first place ahead of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is on 18 per cent.

Mrs Palin and Texas Rep. Ron Paul are on eight and seven per cent, while Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann is down at only four per cent.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, ex-Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and businessman Herman Cain are also all at four per cent.

But between announced runners, Mr Perry gets 29 per cent, Mr Romney receives 22 per cent and Mr Paul and Mrs Bachmann have eight per cent.

Struggling: Minnesota's Michele Bachmann is down at only four per cent, below four other candidates running for the Republican presidential nomination

Mr Romney and Mrs Bachmann have lost much support since the last Fox News poll, taken before Mr Perry had announced he would run.

Rick Perry - 26 per cent

Mitt Romney - 18 per cent

Sarah Palin - 8 per cent

Ron Paul - 7 per cent

Mrs Bachmann tops the ‘too extreme to be seriously considered’ among all voters with 18 per cent, followed by Mr Perry at 14 per cent.

Meanwhile just 20 per cent of voters say Mrs Palin should run for President, in a clear signal that she should stay out of the race.

Mrs Palin will soon end the will-she-won't-she speculation that has trailed the former Republican vice presidential candidate for two years.

The Tea Party darling’s consideration period has been about as unconventional as her presidential campaign seemingly would be.

'After a while you get a little tired of 
the tease. In this case, I 
think the voters have found another girlfriend'

Republican strategist Chip Felkel on Sarah Palin

She is likely to announce plans later this month and has been boosting her profile by writing books and appearing as a paid analyst on Fox News.

But Mr Perry and Mrs Bachmann have generating strong tea party support over the last few month, which could be to Mrs Palin’s detriment.

'After a while you get a little tired of the tease,' Republican strategist Chip Felkel said. 'In this case, I think the voters have found another girlfriend.'

Adult entertainment: Owners are getting their clubs ready in Tampa, Florida, for August 2012's event (file picture)

Next summer’s Republican National Convention appears to be not all about politics.

Adult entertainment owners are getting clubs ready for the 50,000 visitors expected to descend on Tampa, Florida, in August 2012.

The Penthouse Club operator DeWayne Levesque has installed two new secluded VIP rooms, carpets and furniture to add a bit of privacy to after-hours, reported the Huffington Post.

Mons Venus strip club owner Joe Redner said he is expecting to make five times more than he would normally on each night.

‘Republicans (have) got plenty of money,’ he told the Huffington Post. ‘They take it all from poor people.’

One adult star who may wish to attend is Lisa Ann of the ‘Nailin' Palin’ adult film series, who might be a big hit with the Tea Party crowd.
