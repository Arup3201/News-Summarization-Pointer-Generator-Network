Silly: Education Secretary Michael Gove dismissed Ipsa's pay rise idea

The quango chief promising MPs a £7,600 pay rise faced a furious public and political backlash yesterday – with one Cabinet Minister telling him to ‘stick it’.

Sir Ian Kennedy was lambasted by voters during a radio phone-in after confirming plans to give MPs an 11 per cent pay rise, and suggesting it was a ‘very good deal’ for the taxpayer.

Callers to Victoria Derbyshire’s Radio Five show branded the proposals ‘obscene’ and ‘outrageous’, and asked Sir Ian: ‘What planet are you living on?’

Sir Ian, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), also came under fire from leading politicians.

Asked whether the increase should go ahead, Education Secretary Michael Gove said: ‘Absolutely not. MPs are incredibly well paid at the moment anyway, as are ministers.

'Ipsa is a bit of a silly organisation anyway. Pay rise? They can stick it.’

Nick Clegg, who will refuse the rise, said the proposal was not ‘remotely justifiable’ at a time when public sector wage increases were capped at 1 per cent.

Ed Miliband put pressure on David Cameron by saying he too would refuse the rise.

Downing Street refused to say whether the Prime Minister would take the pay increase, but said he thought MPs’ pay ‘should not be going up while public sector pay is being constrained’. Ipsa wants to introduce the pay rise, along with a package of cuts to MPs’ pensions and perks, after the 2015 election.

But there were growing indications last night that it could be delayed until at least 2016, when the public sector wage cap is due to end.

A government source said party leaders were likely to order MPs to refuse the rise if it is brought in before 2016.

‘Hopefully Ipsa will see sense and 
either abandon this proposal or at least delay it,’ the source said. ‘If
they don’t, you will see the parties lay down the law to MPs that they 
cannot take it while pay restraint in the public sector is continuing.’

Trade unions reacted angrily to the 
proposal, and warned a wave of industrial action could follow if MPs 
were handed an 11 per cent rise.

RMT general-secretary Bob Crow said: 
‘If inflation-busting pay increases are good enough for the political 
class then they are good enough for nurses, transport workers, 
firefighters and the rest of the working class.’

The rise would leave MPs three times richer than the average person in Britain

The proposals would see MPs’ basic pay rise from £66,396 to £74,000.

But they would also have their 
gold-plated pensions cut back, see reductions to their controversial 
‘golden handshake’ payments, and lose perks such as free TV licences.

These cuts will partially offset the cost of the pay rise, leaving taxpayers with a total extra bill of £500,000.

MPs would also be paid to produce an 
‘annual report’ on their activities to help ‘inform’ voters about their 
jobs. Critics said the reports were likely to be taxpayer-funded ‘puff 
pieces’.

Sir Ian, who is paid £700 a day to 
advise on MPs’ expenses, said it was time to allow their pay to ‘catch 
up’ after years of being suppressed.

Ipsa said the £74,000 was at the 
‘lower end’ of what it thought MPs deserved to be paid. Its review had 
concluded MPs might deserve as much as £83,430 but decided to recommend 
the lower amount because of the ‘current difficult circumstances’.

An Ipsa survey found that two-thirds 
of MPs believe they are underpaid. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said politics 
would struggle to attract high-calibre people unless MPs were given a 
major pay hike.

He added: ‘MPs are paid about the 
same as a junior school headmistress or headmaster. I’ve got lots and 
lots of those in my constituency, there is only one MP.

‘It is public service. We expect that
we are not going to earn the money that we could have earned in the  
private sector but there has to be some balance in there.’

Many MPs have attacked Ipsa for being
bureaucratic and costly. Tory Douglas Carswell said the pay proposal 
underlined the case for the quango to be scrapped. He added: ‘Faced with
a choice between taking a pay hike, or taking the axe to Ipsa, I would 
vote to scrap Ipsa every time.’
