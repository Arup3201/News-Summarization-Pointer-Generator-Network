Kevin Pietersen has backed incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves to make the changes needed to revitalise the national team.

Graves will take up his new post in May and high on his list of priorities will be to reinvigorate England's one-day side, who were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stages after an embarrassing loss to Bangladesh on Monday.

The defeat gave ammunition to those who believe it was a mistake to axe Pietersen from the international set-up 14 months ago, while Graves appeared to leave the door open for the star batsman earlier this month when he suggested he would have a better chance of an England return if he played county cricket in this country.

Pietersen tweeted on Tuesday: 'Quick note - ECB doesn't decide who gets to play in IPL/Big Bash. The franchises have to want them! Plenty have tried & failed to get a go!

'But, the encouraging news is that the new boss has the vision to look to open up a window to hopefully give players a better chance!

'I really do think changes are going to be made & positive things are going to start to happen for the good of English cricket...'

ECB managing director Paul Downton insisted after Monday's defeat that they needed to look at giving England's players more experience in the Twenty20 format.

Pietersen was sacked by England in January 2014 and has since played domestic T20 cricket for Delhi Daredevils, Surrey, St Lucia Zouks and Melbourne Stars.

The 34-year-old is currently without a county contract, having left Surrey in October.
