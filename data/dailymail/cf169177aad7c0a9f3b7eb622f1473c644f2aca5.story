£100million bank boss Rich Ricci has been accused of being ‘out of touch’ after entering race horse Fatcatinthehat into the Cheltenham Festival.

The Barclays investment banker, who always wears his signature trilby while racing, cashed in £9.7million of shares bonuses last year, earned £44million 
of pay and perks in 2010 and is set to pocket up to £6million in deferred shares bonuses this year.

Labour have accused the 49-year-old of being 'out of touch' with the plight of ordinary, hardworking people after choosing such an insensitive name.

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘It's an insult to every taxpayer and small business in the country. And it shows just how out of touch these bankers are.’

The name might be a reference to a revealing article in The Independent in 2011 about Ricci titled ‘Who’s the fat cat in the hat? The rich world of Rich Ricci.’

Ricci, from Nebraska, USA, rose through the ranks of the 
operations and technology departments at Barclays, spending several 
years as the group's chief operating officer before taking the top job.

As a chief executive of Barclays Capital
he received a huge £44million, including a basic salary of £700,000, a 
£3.3million long-term incentive award, a £9.9 million bonus and 
£30million in shares in 2010.

Despite never accepting a government bailout, Barclays have seen a string of scandals with their bosses receiving millions of pounds in bonuses.

The bank was fined £290million after it admitted manipulating submissions used to calculate interest rates.

Former chief executive was then awarded £17million from the bank despite being forced to resign amidst the interest rate scandal.

New chief executive Antony Jenkins has announced a major restructuring of the bank to help repair its damaged image. Barclay's capital, the investment banking side of the company, will be forced to scale back their operations in Europe and Asia.

Ricci and his wife of 12 years Susannah, 49, have reared 30 horses with champion trainer Willie Mullins, winning £588,125 in prize money this season alone.

They have entered a total of eleven horses to the meeting which starts tomorrow.

He is famous for his trademark trilby and extroverted choice of tailoring when he appears at the races.

Fatcatinthehat won his last race 
and is 12-1 third favourite to win Wednesday’s Fred Winter Juvenile 
Hurdle for a £75,000 prize.

Ladbrokes
spokesman David Williams said: ‘If Fatcatinthehat wins, we will 
sink into recession - all the bankers will be shovelling their bonuses 
on to the horse.

‘Mr Ricci has some fancied runners and it's an odds-on shot he will be celebrating a winner this week.’

Ricci’s other horses have included Champagne Fever, The Midnight Club, Zaidpour, and Scotsirish.

Five Barclays bosses are set to receive up to £17million in shares bonuses this year, including Ricci's £6million

Ricci has been involved in racing in the 
UK and Ireland for years and described watching his horses race and lose
as an experience: 'Like going to a job interview and then puking all 
over yourself.'

Their unbeaten five-year-old thoroughbred Pont Alexandre is favourite to win Wednesday’s Neptune Novices Hurdle.
