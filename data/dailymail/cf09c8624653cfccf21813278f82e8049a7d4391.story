Ukip are 'desperately' trying to secure a high profile Labour defection before the election – and have set their sights on selfie-loving councillor Karen Danczuk.

Mrs Danczuk, who has become embroiled in a furious row with Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman over claims she dismissed the young activist as 'too pretty for politics, is standing down as a councillor in May.

Ukip aides have privately admitted they would 'love' Mrs Danczuk – a working-class mother of two, who is married to the outspoken backbench MP Simon Danczuk – to defect.

The Rochdale councillor has revealed the behind-the-scenes bid to get her to switch. She told MailOnline: 'I'm not joining Ukip, but they are desperately trying.'

A Ukip aide admitted the party were trying to convince Mrs Danczuk to join, but added: 'I don't know if it's desperate.'

Mrs Danczuk last night insisted she would stay involved in Labour politics, despite stepping down from the council in May.

She said: 'I'll still be hanging around and still at the sidelines. I just want to spend a little bit more time with my boys.

'My youngest was one when I first got elected. I want bed times, I want to be tucking them in every night, I don't want to be dashing out to meetings at night time for a while, and spend more time with my boys.

The revelation that Ukip are trying to poach Mrs Danczuk comes after her MP husband Simon was forced to deny growing speculation that he was considering defecting to Ukip.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is trying to get Rochdale councillor Karen Danczuk to defect from Labour

The Rochdale MP, who has previously said Ed Miliband's leadership had been suicidal, was photographed drinking with Nigel Farage at the Anchor Tap pub near near Tower Bridge.

Mr Danczuk, 48, is defending a majority of just 889, had attacked his party leader for 'torturous repetition of political mantras', warning this is turning voters away.

But Mr Danczuk said there was 'no chance' he would join Ukip. He said: 'Nigel and I met for a few pints to talk about politics.

'We had a very detailed conversation about a whole range of things — Europe and immigration through to the general election and beyond.'

At the time Mr Farage refused to discuss whether he had asked Danczuk to defect but said: 'I meet all sorts of people in politics. I was particularly pleased to meet Simon Danczuk.

'He is an interesting politician who thinks for himself. And he 'gets' why Ukip is doing so well in the North of England.'

Mrs Danczuk, meanwhile, has escalated her public spat with Miss Harman – by demanding an apology for calling her a liar over claims she once told her she was 'too pretty to be in politics' and should join a girl band instead.

Miss Harman allegedly made the remarks after being introduced to Mrs Danczuk for the first time.

Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman told MP's wife Karen Danczuk she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead 

It comes after the Labour shadow minister was accused of 'patronising' women after unveiling a bright pink women-only mini bus to attract female voters ahead of the election in May.

Mrs Danczuk said Miss Harman's pink battle bus exposed politicians' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns.

She said: 'What women voters want from politicians is their concerns heard in a serious manner. Not a patronising pink bus screaming drama queen!'

Mrs Danczuk later added: 'When I first met Harriet Harman she said I was far too pretty to be interested in politics & should be in Girls Aloud.'

She told MailOnline: 'It was at a conference in Manchester. I wanted a photo with her and she said 'you're far too pretty to be in politics'. I suppose I've proved her wrong - I did go on to be a councillor.'

But Miss Harman rejected the allegation. She said: 'I deny I ever said that and it's inconceivable I would have ever said that.

'I have always believed it's what you do in politics, not what you look like. I have never discouraged a woman from getting involved in politics on the basis of their looks.'

The allegation sparked fresh accusations that Mrs Harman was belittling female voters.

But Mrs Danczuk said she found the row 'upsetting' because she took the remark as a compliment.

She told LBC's Iain Dale last night: 'It's really upsetting because I actually took it as a compliment.

'It was the conference where Gordon Brown first took over, everyone was excited – really, really happy. There always is a bit of a disco on one of the nights.

'It was the first time I'd ever met Harriet. So, I went over and said 'Harriet can I have a photograph'.

'She said 'yeah, yeah, of course, yeah'. So we had a little bit of a chit chat. She said 'what do you do?' and I said 'I'm a local party activist'.

'She said 'oh you're far too pretty to be in politics you should be in Girls Aloud. I actually took it as a compliment.

'I actually took it as a compliment, I wasn't insulted by it. I thought thank you that's actually really nice. Of course a women isn't going to be insulted by a compliment.

'But what does upset me is that she is saying I'm lying. I just think, if you didn't remember saying that to me then just say, 'I don't remember saying that but I'm glad that she's proved me wrong'.

'But to say that I'm lying, I just think, no, that's not very nice.'

'I'm sure she just thought, young, pretty party activist, give her a little compliment and that will be the end of it. I'm sure she never thought at the time that some years later it would come back and haunt her.

Mrs Danczuk said Labour's pink battle van – which has been dubbed the Harriet's Barbie bus – exposed MPs' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns

She added: 'Even to this day I took it as a compliment, but I do not appreciate being called a liar. That's what has upset me. There was no reason for me to lie about that.

'I think Harriet should apologise, because she is absolutely wrong and she's really upset me. I don't want it being a massive public spat – I'm telling the truth. Calling me a liar is absolutely wrong and the more she calls me a liar the more I won't let this drop.

'But if she turned up next week in her pink bus and said 'Karen, I'm sorry let's have a talk' I'd definitely welcome it.

'If she wants to apologise and come to Rochdale I'd welcome her with open arms.'
