Microsoft has expanded its Xbox Music streaming service and it is now available for free for everyone to use through a web browser.

The service launched in October last year and was initially only available on Windows 8 devices and Xbox game consoles with a monthly subscription.

The new free web service is aiming to rival the likes of other music sites such as Spotify, Pandora and iTunes.

Microsoft's new Xbox Music service will allow users to listen on the console, computer and phone, and will take on iTunes and Spotify

Microsoft has additionally released Xbox
Music apps for Apple's iPhone and iPad as well as Android devices that 
can be used by people with Music Pass subscriptions.

A Microsoft Music Pass costs £8.99 a month or $£89.90 a year. It also comes with a 30-day free trial.

Xbox Music Pass also allows users unlimited access to thousands of music videos on an Xbox 360 console.

These apps directly compete with Google's Music All Access service and the upcoming iTunes Radio, a streaming service for iOS phones and tablets expected later in the year.

Microsoft said in a statement: 'Xbox Music Pass brings the catalogue of music to iOS and Android devices.

'Get unlimited access to the songs 
and artists you want at any time with playback across your tablet, PC, 
phone and Xbox console.

'With the addition of free streaming on 
the web, enjoy on-demand access to 30 million songs globally for free on
the Xbox Music Web player.'

The release continues that 'discovering and enjoying 
free music is as easy as typing an artist or song name and hitting 'play.'

Songs can also be added to playlists 
for free and a song added to one device is automatically synced across 
all registered devices.

The
free service is subsidised by adverts and also sells downloadable 
tracks.

There is additionally a radio service that generates playlists 
based on similar genres or musicians. 

The free streaming service is available at Xbox Music Web player and after six months streaming is limited to 10 hours per month.

When the Xbox One is released on 22 November, users will also be able to play games while listening to Xbox Music simultaneously, a feature that isn't offered on the Xbox 360.
