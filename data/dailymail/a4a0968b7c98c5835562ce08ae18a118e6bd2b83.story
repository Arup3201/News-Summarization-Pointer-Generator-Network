Jailed: David Williamson was jailed for 10 years after threatening London landmarks with bombs and guns

A self-styled terrorist and convicted armed robber who threatened to blow up Harrods, Westminster Abbey and several other London landmarks was jailed for 10 years today.

David Williamson, 50, concocted a catalogue of plots across London to 'bring the transport system down', claiming to be a member of a terrorist group called 'Scottish and Irish Sympathisers'.

The attacker, who had more than 140 previous convictions, was also sentenced for three counts of possession of an imitation firearm which he used to hold up a travel agent, a hotel reception and to threaten a money shop employee.

Described in a psychiatric report as a 'volatile, unpredictable and reckless individual', the court heard he barged into nine of the capital's landmarks - including The Ritz and Hilton Park Lane hotels - telling people a bomb would 'go off'.

On October 15, 2012, he sparked a mass evacuation in Harrods after leaving a note - covered in his fingerprints - that read: 'There is a device, bomb, due to go off in this store in 40 minutes.'

The world famous store was forced to shut for around 15 minutes incurring a loss of about £40,000.

The day before, he left a chilling message for the British Transport Police, saying: 'I have got a message for you.

'Scottish and Irish sympathisers are going to bring down London, starting with the rail network.

'There
 are several devices been planted (sic) in various areas. I will not 
elaborate until it goes off. I will not elaborate any further until they
 go off, and then you will receive a coded message.'

And 11 days later, he pulled a 'big gun' on staff in the Money Shop, in Maidstone, after being refused a payday loan.

He then went to Best Western Delaware Hotel in Hyde Park, told the receptionist he had a gun, and made off with £205.

Sentencing Williamson today, Judge Nicholas Jones told him: 'You have been in trouble in the past, including a firearms offence in 1995.

This is the gun he was seen to be holding in CCTV. He also told a London hotel he had a gun to make off with £205

'Your previous convictions do not make good reading.'

He added: 'So far as the bomb hoaxes go, police got the impression at an early stage that they were not credible threats, but they resulted in police attending various venues in west London and I’m told that an emergency phone call from from the public could not be responded to promptly because of your threat.'

Jurors heard that after he was arrested and questioned, a voice recognition expert was able to match Williamson’s voice and Scottish accent in the recorded interview to that of the caller on the call centre logs.

The court heard from Harrods' head of security Morgan O’Grady who was on duty when the note was found on October 15th and said: 'We couldn’t take risks with peoples lives.

'It could have been a joke, it could have been a disgruntled member of staff who left the note, or it could have been serious. We couldn’t take that risk.'

Westminster Abbey was targeted, as was Harrods, which was brought to a standstill for 15 minutes after staff found a note from Williamson, who had 140 previous convictions when jailed at Kingston Crown Court

He described how, trawling through CCTV, he spotted Williamson sat in a leather chair in the store prior to leaving the note and removed the chair so fingerprints could be obtained.

Williamson, who is based in both Wimbledon, south London, and Kent, was described as 'nervous' when, days later, he launched his attack on the money store.

A member of staff described the weapon as 'black and metallic'.

David Harounoff, prosecuting, said: 'The witness heard a clicking sound as if the gun was being loaded.

'He said to him "just give me my stuff back or I’ll shoot".'

Two days later Williamson entered Thompson Travel Limited, in Golden Square, Warrington, and asked for £15,000 in euros.

He told staff to 'put that money over there through that hole and don’t say anything' before lifting his top to reveal a 'black handgun tucked into his waist'.

Williamson told the staff they had been 'good girls' before making off with £3,895.

He made his escape on a bus, but police were waiting for him when he got to Runcorn bus station.

He told one of the officers: 'I’m going to kill you'. He later told officers he had bought a black desert eagle BB gun from a shop for £29.

Richard Keogh, in mitigation, said that Williamson 'didn’t really get it' and had a mental illness 'bordering on psychiatric illness, but not quite there yet.'

Williamson was sentenced to two counts of possession of an imitation firearm at the time of committing an offence namely robbery, two counts of robbery, one count of possession of an imitation firearm with the threat of violence, one count of fraud, and five counts of communication false information with intent.
