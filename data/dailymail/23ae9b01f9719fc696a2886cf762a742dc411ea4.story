One of the suspects in the London murder of the former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko is willing to co-operate with the inquiry into his death, the hearing heard yesterday.

Mr Litvinenko died from radioactive poisoning three weeks after meeting former Russian agents Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun at a Mayfair hotel in November 2006. 

Kovtun and Lugovoi are suspected of slipping radioactive polonium-210 into Litvinenko’s tea. Both deny involvement and remain in Russia.

A man giving the name Dmitri Kovtun has been contacting the inquiry, counsel to the hearing Robin Tam QC told chairman Sir Robert Owen. 

'During the course of the last fortnight, the solicitor to the inquiry has received communications from a man who has given his name as Dmitri Kovtun.

'He has said he is willing to take part in the inquiry.'

Sir Robert was expected to hear closing statements by the end of the month but Mr Tam said there was no prospect of hearing any evidence from Kovtun before Easter.

It was unclear whether the Russian was offering to give evidence by video link or face questioning by police.

The hearing was set up by the Home Secretary, Theresa May, last year.
