Justice Secretary Ken Clarke proposes to increase sentencing from two years in prison to five

Dangerous drivers who cause serious injuries on the road could be jailed for up to five years under new plans, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke said today.

The introduction of a new offence of 'causing serious injury by dangerous driving' would more than double the current maximum sentence of two years for dangerous drivers whose victims are seriously injured but not killed.

The change was spurred on by cases such as that of motorist Christopher Marr, who was jailed for just 26 months when he left 14-year-old Devon Foster with horrific injuries after a collision.

Judge Steven Everett presided over his case and said it 'defies belief' that he could not sentence Marr for longer.

He was released from prison after 13 months.

Campaigners welcomed the proposals, saying that, with 1,850 deaths on the roads in Britain last year alone, the move would 'help to provide justice to families whose lives have been ripped apart by dangerous drivers'.

Mr Clarke said: 'We have listened to the victims of dangerous drivers, their families, MPs, judges and road safety groups and their experiences have directly informed these changes.

The review was sparked by the lack of sentencing power that a judge said he had when jailing the driver behind the horrific injuries of 14-year-old Devon Foster

'Making our roads safer is a priority -
five people died on our roads each day last year, so we need to do 
everything we can to further improve safety.'

Ellen
Booth, from road safety charity Brake, said:
'This new offence finally means that serious injury is recognised 
within the title of the offence, and this recognition is vitally 
important to victims and their families.

'It also means that dangerous drivers 
who inflict serious injuries can expect to see higher sentences to 
better reflect the terrible trauma and injuries they have caused.'

Andrew Howard, head of road safety at 
the AA, said the changes, which will be part of the Government's Legal 
Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, 'should make sentences
more proportionate to the devastation dangerous driving causes and 
should also deter people from driving badly'.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning added that while the vast majority of motorists were safe and responsible, 'the wilfully reckless minority who put lives in danger must face serious penalties'.

Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: 'RoSPA has previously called for the offence of causing death by dangerous driving to be extended to cover causing serious injury, so we welcome the announcement of a new offence of 'causing serious injury by dangerous driving'.

'Serious injuries often cause life-long disability for the victims of bad drivers and can fundamentally affect their quality of life and that of their families.

'To ensure this new law works as intended, it will be absolutely crucial to ensure that it is applied consistently in terms of prosecution and sentencing.'

Robert Gifford, executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, said 'The main response to this proposal must be to ask: what exactly is meant by "serious injury"?

'The definition in Reported Road Casualties refers to a visit to accident and emergency or an overnight stay in hospital.

'I assume that, if the injury results from an act of dangerous driving, then the definition must imply an injury that is life-changing.

'It will be important for Parliament to give a clear indication of what is understood by serious when the amendment is debated. Otherwise, it is quite likely that the offence may be placed on the statute book with little or no effect.

'At present, just under 6,000 drivers are charged every year with dangerous driving. Yet we have no information about how many of those charges are the result of a crash involving serious injuries.

'So, it will be important to understand just how many extra court cases will result from the new offence.

'I hope that MPs and peers will therefore look very carefully at the detail of this offence to ensure that it leads to improvements in road safety, especially as it was not referred to in either the Strategic Framework for Road Safety published by the Government in May 2011 or the earlier consultation document on Road Safety Compliance published in November 2008.'

A judge who wrote to David Cameron last year asking why he was unable to sentence a driver to more than two years has been cited as sparking the the re-think in the law.

Christopher Marr  was sentenced to 26 months in prison when he crashed into three teenage girls in Bromley Cross, Bolton, after taking his girlfriend's car while drunk on August 22 last year.

He drove at 90mph on the wrong side of the road before mounting a pavement and colliding with the girls, who were walking home from a party, leaving a scene of 'absolute devastation'.

Devon Foster, then 14, was left fighting for her life with a fracture that ran from ear to ear under the front of her eyes, a cracked bone in her back, a bruised kidney, a fractured right arm and an ankle injury.

She was left with brain injuries, scars and still suffers from hearing problems but has been able to finish her GCSEs.

Judge Steven Everett presided over the case and ordered for the court transcripts to be sent to the Prime Minister and the Justice Secretary when he found he could sentence Marr for just 26 months. He was released after 13 months.

Summing up at Bolton Crown Court he said: 'For many years lawyers and judges have been railing against the government to change the sentence.

'It defies belief that successive governments have not seen fit to increase the maximum sentence. It is about time the government got its facts right and sorted itself out.'

Miss Foster, now 15, backs the proposal. She said: 'I'm very happy the law is being changed. It's just sad that I have had to go through what I've been through for the law to be changed.'

Her mother, Sam, 42, added: Devon's mum Sam, 42, added: 'It is wonderful, it's great news. It is a pity it has had to happen like this for so many families to go through what we've gone through for the Government to sit up and take notice.

'Christopher Marr is already out of prison but Devon is still serving her life sentence.

'She's got scars to look at every day, medication to take every day, hospital appointments each month. Devon's life has been turned upside down and her life has been put on hold.

'People may think twice now before driving dangerously.'
