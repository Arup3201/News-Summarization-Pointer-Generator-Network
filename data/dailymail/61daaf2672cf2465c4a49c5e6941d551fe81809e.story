Tony Blair was joined by his wife Cherie and senior Labour figures yesterday as he mourned the loss of one of his most trusted advisers during his time in power.

The Blairs arrived with their children at the funeral of Lord Philip Gould, who at 61 died earlier this month following a battle with cancer.

Fellow former prime minister Gordon Brown was also accompanied by his with Sarah alongside over 450 mourners at All Saints Church in central London.

Former Chancellor Alistair Darling, Lord Mandelson, and David and Ed Miliband were also among those to pay tribute to their friend and former colleague.

Also in attendance was former Director of Government Relations Baroness Nye, Lord Browne, Lord Prescott, Jack Straw, Lord and Lady Kinnock, Ed Balls, Yvette Cooper and David Blunkett.

Former Labour Party fundraiser Lord Levy was following close behind, as was television presenter Claudia Winkleman.

Political strategist and pollster Lord Gould was one of the architects of New Labour and one of Tony Blair’s most trusted advisers.

He was a key figure behind Labour’s three consecutive general election victories and urged the party to listen to polls and ‘focus groups’ to discover what voters wanted.

He died at the Royal Marsden hospital in London and his family later asked for any commemorative donations to be given to the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity in aid of research and treatment of oesophageal cancer.

Blair looked solemn as he arrived at the service alongside his wife and children Nicholas, Euan, Katharine and Leo.

Last week Mr Blair paid tribute to Lord Gould as an 'indispensable' member of his political team.

'Philip was such a huge part of the renaissance of the Labour Party,' said the former prime minister.

'To me he was my guide and mentor, a wise head, a brilliant mind, and a total rock when a storm was raging. He became indispensable.

'He was a constant advocate for the British people, their hopes and anxieties. So his political contribution was immense.'

Lord Gould died last Sunday night with his wife, Random House publishing boss Gail Rebuck, and daughters Georgia and Grace at his side.

The former advertising executive, who founded a polling and strategy company, Philip Gould Associates, was recruited in the 1980s by Peter Mandelson, then Labour's communications director.

He worked first for Neil Kinnock and became the party's strategy and polling adviser for the election victories in 1997, 2001 and 2005 under Mr Blair.

Former business secretary Lord Mandelson said when hearing of his death: 'Philip was as brave in his illness as he was in his politics, always doing things differently.

'For Labour, he was instrumental in driving a revolution that transformed not just our party but British politics as a whole.'

Lord Gould, who became a life peer in 2004, had undergone treatment for cancer of the oesophagus, but the illness later recurred.

In his final television interview, in 
September, he said he believed that the 'nastiness' of politics had 
contributed to his cancer.

He was asked by Andrew Marr in 
September about something 'that your wife Gail said to you; that 
politics, being involved in politics, was somehow connected to your 
cancer; that the nastiness of politics and the aggression of politics 
had somehow contributed to your cancer?'

Lord Gould replied: 'Yes, I think 
that's true. What would have been better for me would have been to have 
said I'll do what I can do, which I do quite well, and then just push it
back a little bit.

'And of course the other side of it is
that it's only because I'm an obsessive nutcase when it comes to 
politics that I've done what I've done.'
