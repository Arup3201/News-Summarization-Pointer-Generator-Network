Jerry Sandusky's adopted son revealed to police he had been sexually abused by the convicted pedophile - but worried he would be charged with perjury for not admitting the attacks under oath to a grand jury.

Matt Sandusky, now 33, reportedly can be heard on a 25-minute recording admitting to officers that he had been abused by the man who adopted him when he was a teenager.

Jerry Sandusky, was taken to Centre County Correctional Facility in Pennsylvania after being convicted of 45 out of 48 charges of child sex abuse on Friday.

Karl Rominger, part of Jerry Sandusky's defense team, told ABC: 'As a general rule it's a tape of Matt (Sandusky) making the allegations.

'I don't feel comfortable going into specifics about what he says, but I'll say that he is an alleged victim, so that will tell you some.'

The young man hesitated to reveal the horrific abuse he was also allegedly a victim of because he had previously said under oath that no abuse had taken place. 

However Jerry Sandusky's attorney questioned the veracity of the adopted son's claims, saying that Matt's story appeared to have come back 'all of a sudden'.

Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children with wife Dottie.

His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine 
Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and 
saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of 
prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial.

The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but did not go into specifics.

The revelation of the tape came as Jerry Sandusky still insisted through a lawyer yesterday that he is not guilty of sexually abusing children.

The case rocked the Penn State community following the defense coordinator's arrest in November.

The ensuing scandal led to the firing of Sandusky's former boss - Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno - and the university's president, while forcing a re-examination of the role that college administrators played in reporting abuse allegations.

A juror who voted to convict the retired Penn State assistant coach said she hoped the verdict would help his accusers heal.

The jury found the testimony of the eight victims who took the witness stand compelling, Ann Van Kuren said yesterday.

Jurors weighed the accounts and evidence diligently before finding Sandusky guilty last week of 45 counts for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years, she said.

She expressed empathy for the eight men who offered emotional and explicit testimony.

'I really feel for the victims and any other victims that are out there that haven't come forward,' Van Kuren said.

'That all of them need to heal. I'm hoping that this trial, with this verdict, will help them heal.'

Sandusky, 68, is under observation at
the Centre County jail, where he is being kept away from other inmates 
pending a psychological review that will help determine the next step 
toward his sentencing in about three months.

'He's defiant and wants the truth to 
be told. He wants people to know that he's not guilty,' said defense 
lawyer Karl Rominger, who visited his incarcerated client on Monday.

Judge John Cleland ordered county probation officers to evaluate whether Sandusky is a sexual predator, a finding that could factor into his prison placement.

Sex offenders are required to undergo treatment while in prison, so if deemed a predator,  Sandusky would likely be sent to a facility with such a program.

Sandusky, who has been placed under a suicide watch, said he doesn't want to kill himself and wants to get the separate psychological examination done so that he can receive visits from his friends and family, Rominger said.

'He's fine but he's just not been evaluated,' the lawyer said. 'He is very disappointed to be in prison. He is anxious to get out of this suicide watch.'

Rominger added that Sandusky told him: 'If I have to keep sitting in this room for another three or four days without being able to talk to anybody, I might start to need help at that point.'

The state investigation into Sandusky didn't begin until after the ex-coach was barred from a high school in 2009, when a mother complained about the former coach. At the time, Governor Tom Corbett was the state attorney general. Charges were filed in November 2011.

Sandusky has repeatedly maintained his innocence. He will likely die in prison, given mandatory minimum sentencing requirements.

The conviction is just the start of possibly years of legal proceedings over the case. Besides appeals, there remains an active investigation into Sandusky by the state attorney general's office, as well as a federal investigation.

Corbett said Penn State trustees are still awaiting the results of an internal investigation by former FBI director Louis Freeh into the school's handling of the Sandusky case.

The university could also face a wave of new lawsuits. An hour after the verdict Friday night, Penn State said in a statement it was inviting victims to 'participate in a program to facilitate the resolution of claims against the university arising out of Mr. Sandusky's conduct'.

The school said it sought to address victims' concerns privately, expeditiously and fairly.

Asked to clarify, school spokesman Dave LaTorre said the university won't discuss details about litigation or how much money might be set aside for potential settlements, and declined to comment further.
