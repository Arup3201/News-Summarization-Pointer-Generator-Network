AS a former prima ballerina, she is only too aware of the importance of limbering up for a performance.

And it seems old habits die hard for Darcey Bussell – even when the production in question is nothing more than a leisurely stroll with the dogs.

As the 43-year-old walked on Wimbledon Common in London with her spaniel-poodle crossbreeds Lolli and Pop, she struck a number of poses reminiscent of her ballet days. 

And stretch... Strictly Come dancing judge Darcey Bussell appeared to be pulling some poses reminiscent of her Ballet dancing hey day, right,  as she walked her two dogs Lolli and Pop out on Wimbledon Common

Wearing black high-heeled wellington boots and a bright jacket, the Strictly Come Dancing judge raised her left arm above her head in a half-hearted echo of one of her stage poses.

She then swapped arms and repeated the motion, before rolling her head back in a circular movement. The former Royal Ballet principal dancer retired in 2007, but made a comeback when she performed at the closing ceremony for the Olympics earlier this year.

She has also replaced singer Alesha Dixon on the judging panel of the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing.

The mother of two has admitted missing the limelight since her retirement, saying: ‘I came out of career and I finished at the top.

‘Just like an athlete, it’s such an adrenaline rush and when you step aside, of course there’s something missing. It’s hard when you’ve spent most of your life being a perfectionist in an art form.’
