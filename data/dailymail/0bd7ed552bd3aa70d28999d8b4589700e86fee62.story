A fearless daredevil has risked his life by climbing an industrial chimney and balancing on a beam above a sheer drop - without safety equipment.

Flaviu Cernescu scaled the abandoned structure in Pitesti, Romania, using a disconnected electrical cable to hoist himself for the first 70ft of the climb.

The 32-year-old then walked across a rusted railing which runs across the summit of the hollow 920ft structure.

Some of the scenes in the video are sure to leave many viewers gasping in fear

Despite the long drop, Cernescu, who captured the footage using a GoPro camera, said he felt calm and confident for most of the stunt. 

But Mr Cernescu has a warning for anyone who may want to copy his stunt.

Mr Cernescu doesn't underestimate the danger of the chimney climb as he warns viewers of the video

For the first 70ft Mr Cernescu had to use a disused electrical cable to climb the chimney

'Please understand that by climbing this chimney you put yourself and others in danger,' said the fearless Romanian.

'Don't try it unless you really know what you are doing. Take care and enjoy life.'

And people who have viewed the incredible video on YouTube are impressed, if not a little shocked at the extremity of the challenge.

Once at the top, the daredevil walked over a rickety old frame in a heartstopping scene

A YouTube user named KnowHope wrote: 'The part where he walks on the chimney rim and across the beam on the chimney is enough to give anyone vertigo even if you are in an office sitting on a chair.'

S Powers added: 'My head is spinning watching this. Must blow up full screen and watch in HD.'

Rhys Burns writes: 'My palms are sweating and my heart racing just from watching that! That was awesome!'
