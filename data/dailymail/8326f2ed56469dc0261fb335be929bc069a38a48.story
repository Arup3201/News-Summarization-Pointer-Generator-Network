Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is still confident he will land Fabio Borini in a £14million deal, despite the striker boarding the flight to Liverpool's tour to the States.

The two clubs have agreed the fee for the Italian forward.

And Poyet is still planning to speak to Borini and his representatives on Monday.

But doubts now surround the deal after Borini was pictured with the Liverpool squad leaving Merseyside on Sunday.

However,
 Poyet is 'relaxed' about the apparent setback and optimistic he can 
persuade the 23-year-old to return to Sunderland where he spent last 
season on loan.

The 
Sunderland manager will still speak with Borini's agents and is prepared
 to fly him back from America to join up with Sunderland's training camp
 in Portugal this weekend.

While
 still keen to speak to Poyet, Borini is not in a rush to sign for 
Sunderland and is understood to have told Rodgers he would rather wait 
and keep his options open.

He hopes a Champions League club from abroad 
will match Poyet's bid after being told he has no future at Anfield.

Poyet said: 'What I can inform you is that we have agreed terms with Liverpool.

'It’s
 an ongoing thing. We’ve done the steps that we needed to do properly, 
but the next step is that we are still waiting for the correspondence. 
Then we will go on from there, doing everything official, in the right 
way.

'I think Fabio’s impact is clear, as is the reason why 
we want to spend that quantity of money. We know how much he can give us
 because we know him perfectly. It would be perfect for us.

'I’m
 really calm regarding Fabio and Marcos because as everyone knows, it’s 
not about numbers or quantity, it’s more about the quality of your 
signings. I’m delighted with what we’ve done so far.'

Sweden 
international Seb Larsson has welcomed the potential addition of Borini 
who became a cult hero on Wearside last season after notching two goals 
against rivals Newcastle.

The veteran midfielder, who signed a
 new deal in the summer despite interest from Italy, Turkey and Sweden, 
says the 23-year-old former Chelsea and Parma striker will be welcomed 
back to the North East by players and fans.

Larsson said: 'It
 would be a really big deal for the club. Fabio was here last year and 
did really well, so he knows the place and we know him.

'Of 
course that would be a great signing, but for the people behind the 
scenes to deal with and we’ll have to see if it gets over the line.

'He
 showed last year just what a good player he is, especially in the 
second half of the season. We all know what he can bring to the team, 
and you need as many good players as you can to help improve the 
competition in the squad.

'If Fabio returns, it will help everyone else 
drive on and get better.'
