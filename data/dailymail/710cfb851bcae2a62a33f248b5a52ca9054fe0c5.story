Former senior Olympic team official, Greg Hodge, is being investigated after a new set of allegations were made about his behaviour.

The head coach at the West Coast Swimming Club had already been accused of inappropriate behaviour after it was alleged that he kissed a female junior swimmer on the cheek at a Canberra state championship event. 

Swimming Western Australia received complaints about the incident and Hodges' coaching membership with the Australian Swimming Coaches and Teachers Association is currently under review.

However a second allegation regarding inappropriate conduct is reported to have been put forward about the coach last week, according to News Limited.

A second Olympic coach, Michael Palfrey, has also been revealed to have had allegations of inappropriate conduct towards young teenage athletes launched against him.

The former senior Olympic team official is still being investiated over a previous allegation that he kissed a female junior swimmer on the cheek

Some of the official complaints have come from former coach Tim Lane who alleged he saw Mr Palfrey 'affectionately touch and rub the neck and shoulders of female athletes ...', News Limited reports.

Swimming Western Australia CEO Darren Beazley dubbed allegations against a second olympic coach, Michael Palfrey, as 'unsubstantiated'

Mr Lane's allegations also included a recollection of a number of incidents, in one of which he claimed Mr Palfrey encouraged a male teenage swimming student to improve his time by telling him he could 'spend a night with one of his older female athletes' who was nearby at the time, and 'do whatever he wanted to her'.

Mr Palfrey denied all of the allegations which have been dismissed after a joint investigation by Swimming WA and he Western Australian Institute of Sport found them to be 'unsubstantiated'. 

It has meanwhile been announced that Australian Olympic team officials and coaches will undergo mandatory working with children checks in the lead-up to the Rio games in 2016.

Australian Olympic Committee John Coates said the move was sparked by revelations at the royal commission into child sexual abuse.

'I want us to try and set the highest standard possible here in protecting athletes,' he said.

Mr Coates has consulted with British and US counterparts on the issue of child abuse in elite sport and praised their vigorous policies. Australia was looking at similar policies.
