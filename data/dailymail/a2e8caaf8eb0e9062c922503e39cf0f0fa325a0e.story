Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day.

Saturday saw a remarkable result at St Mary's as Southampton put eight past hapless Sunderland, while Sergio Aguero scored four of his own and Chelsea maintained their cushion at the top with a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace.

There were wins also for West Ham, Everton and Newcastle, while Arsenal and Hull City shared four goals at Emirates.

GK - Joe Hart (MANCHESTER CITY vs Tottenham) - 9

Although Sergio Aguero will steal the headlines for his four goals in City's impressive win, the England goalkeeper deserves credit for the two or three crucial saves he made to ensure Tottenham weren't allowed a route back into the match. Not least was his penalty save from Roberto Soldado on the hour mark, which would have pulled the scores back to 2-2.

DEF - Kieran Tripper (BURNLEY vs West Ham) - 7.5

Burnley may have lost 3-1, but Trippier caught the eye with his performance both defensively and going forward. He delivered 13 crosses and set up three chances for the Clarets.

DEF - John Terry (CHELSEA vs Crystal Palace) 7.5

Making his 500th appearance as Chelsea captain, Terry was his usual influential self as the Blues preserved their five point lead at the top. His one black mark was when he chopped down Frazier Campbell, having been well and truly beaten for pace. But otherwise another performance of consistency like the 499 that came before.

DEF - Michael Dawson (HULL CITY vs Arsenal) 8

Dawson was rock solid at the back as the Tigers almost held out for all three points at the Emirates and he had already departed injured by the time Danny Welbeck equalised in stoppage time. The centre-half won pretty much every header and made clearance after clearance as waves of Arsenal attack were kept at bay.

DEF - Leighton Baines (EVERTON vs Aston Villa) 7.5

Another accomplished all-round performance by the England left-back, delivering the ball that was headed in by the increasingly prolific Phil Jagielka on 18 minutes after he had turned Ashley Westwood inside out. Also delivered the ball that Seamus Coleman hooked in for 3-0 in the second half.

MID - Gabriel Obertan (NEWCASTLE UNITED vs Leicester City) 7.5

Obertan ended a very long wait of 32 months for a top-flight goal as Newcastle recorded their first Premier League win of the season against Leicester. Gliding infield from the left, he fired beyond Kasper Schmeichel from 20 yards to settle the contest.

MID - Cesc Fabregas (CHELSEA vs Crystal Palace) 8.5

Was given licence to pull the strings in the final third and took full advantage to continue his - and Chelsea's - excellent form. He combined nicely with Loic Remy in the same way he has linked with Diego Costa all season. Took his goal wonderfully, fooling Julian Speroni to round off a flowing move.

MID - Frank Lampard (MANCHESTER CITY vs Tottenham) - 8

Only lasted 27 minutes before going off injured but was exceptional in that time. Involved in City's first goal and then won the penalty for their second, converted by Sergio Aguero.

MID - Oscar (CHELSEA vs Crystal Palace) - 8

Showed Brazilian class to curl home the free-kick that gave Chelsea the lead at Selhurst Park, sending the ball across Speroni rather than over the wall and in. Played a bit deeper but to good effect, dictating the pace of the game.

FWD - Dusan Tadic (SOUTHAMPTON vs Sunderland) - 8.5

There were many candidates in the Southampton team that put eight past Sunderland but the Serb Tadic was the stand-out. Not only score during the second-half but contributed four asissts, equalling a Premier League record in so doing. Tadic has proved an inspired buy over the summer and Ronald Koeman's side look mightily impressive.

FWD - Sergio Aguero (MANCHESTER CITY vs Tottenham) - 9.5

Very nearly a perfect 10 for the City striker, whose four goals inspired the win over Spurs. His penalty miss was the only blot that prevented him getting a top mark. Was brimming with confidence and unplayable all afternoon, showing composure with his finishing from 12 yards and beyond.
