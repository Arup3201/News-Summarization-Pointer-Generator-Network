A narrow city street got narrower still after a parking bay blunder by a local council.

Leicester City Council sent contractors to paint more bays on Gosling Street last Sunday to increase the parking capacity in the city.

But local residents complained after noticing that there would only be a gap big enough for a motorbike to pass through if all the bays were filled.

Blundering Leicester city council painted parking bays that would block this road if they were in use

One resident told the Leicester Mercury: 'One set of bays finishes on the left-hand side of the road and the set on the right-hand side starts two feet later.

'People are parking in them and blocking the road, which is only about 10ft wide.'

A spokeswoman for Leicester City Council said the error had been corrected.

'A mistake was made but work to correct the parking bays has now been completed,' the spokeswoman said.

The Leicester parking bay fiasco came to light in the same week that workmen in Essex painted a 30mph speed limit on a busy A road - right next to a sign declaring the limit to be 40mph.

The mixed signals were spotted on St. Mary's Lane heading towards Upminster town centre.

Councillor Michael White, leader of 
Havering Council, said: 'This was a mistake made by Carillion Plc, 
working on behalf of UK Power Networks.

'We
have told Carillion to correct the markings as soon as possible, 
otherwise we will put them right and charge them accordingly.'

A Carillion spokesman said the 30mph sign would be corrected this week.
