Grammar schools plan to admit more poor pupils, it was revealed yesterday.

They are aiming to take a higher proportion of students who are eligible for free school meals by changing admissions policies.

Over-subscribed schools could give preference to FSM pupils who pass the 11-plus test, just as children in care are currently given priority.

Selective schools also aim to hold more 11-plus ‘familiarisation sessions’ with primary schools, and to develop exams that are ‘resistant to coaching’ to help give a level playing field.

Schools Minister David Laws discussed the plans before the Commons education select committee.

He highlighted the Coalition’s pupil premium policy – extra cash given to schools based on the number of their pupils eligible for free school meals, given to the poorest, and those in care for six months or longer.

He told MPs: ‘We are trying to talk to grammar schools about giving young people fairer access opportunities.

‘We are trying to allow them to use the pupil premium as a factor in their admissions policy, we are trying to encourage them to ensure that testing is fairer to young people.’

Fears: There have long been claims that wealthier pupils 'monopolise' grammar places with private tuition

Some grammar schools admit by ranked order – all candidates are ranked by their 11-plus score.

In other areas, pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria, which can include the distance they live from the school. The schools are being encouraged to adopt FSM as another admission criteria.

Barry Sindall, of the Grammar School Heads Association, said some do this already – but ‘more are likely to do so as they look at the issue’.

He said: ‘We have been negotiating with the Department for Education to make sure we can get the right form of words for schools. It’s a decision for each and every individual school... But where people want to do it, we’re looking at ways to support them.’

Mr Sindall said grammar schools ‘are not looking to lower the standard at all’.

He added: ‘Schools might have two, three, four categories of criteria where people are given preference.

‘Some schools for example, might include an admission criteria in favour of FSM but only in their local area.’

Education charity The Sutton Trust has said grammar schools are being monopolised by affluent pupils.

Its research shows just 2.7 per cent of entrants to grammar schools are eligible for free school meals.

In December, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, claimed that ministers should resist calls to expand grammar schools because they are ‘stuffed full’ of middle-class children and fail to improve social mobility.

‘Sharp-elbowed’ parents who move house to get children into top schools are not at fault, the Schools Minister said yesterday.

David Laws rejected the idea that those who pay a premium to live in good catchment areas should be blamed. He said: ‘To do all you can to help your children succeed in life is exactly what we want everybody to be doing.

‘So I’m afraid that we can’t cap any of those opportunities. What we need to do is extend them to those young people who are not getting them at the moment.’

He also attacked the ‘tolerance of failure’ for poorer pupils.
