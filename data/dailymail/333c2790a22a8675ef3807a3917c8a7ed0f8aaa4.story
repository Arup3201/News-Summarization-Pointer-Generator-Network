Thieves, burglars and violent thugs will be free to work in schools, hospitals and care homes after a ruling by judges.

The Supreme Court said thousands of criminals should be allowed to wipe their record clean so they are not haunted forever by past offences.

The change means people will not be forced to disclose some convictions to prospective employers – because this breaches their human rights. Those affected by the ruling include people applying for certain kinds of jobs involving work with children or vulnerable adults.

A man who was forced to reveal two cautions for bike theft aged 11 to his new employers has won his case the the Supreme Court (pictured) after arguing it breached his human rights

Up to now, anyone wanting to work in these areas has had to disclose any
 previous convictions or cautions, which stayed on their records 
indefinitely. But a panel of five Supreme Court judges yesterday upheld a
 Court of Appeal judgment that blanket checks could breach a person’s 
right to a private or family life.

The Home Office challenged that judgment, saying it compromised the 
protection of children and  vulnerable groups, but in the meantime 
introduced a system to filter out single minor convictions or  cautions 
during an enhanced criminal records check.

This meant that offences including burglary, common assault, shoplifting
 and trespassing would eventually be expunged from a person’s record as 
long as they were not jailed or committed any further crimes.

Under new guidelines from the Government's Disclosure and Barring Service employers will not be able to see or ask about certain old or minor cautions and convictions.

They will still be able to see convictions relating to violent or sexual offences, or certain offences relation to children or vulnerable people.

They will also be able to see offences that resulted in a conviction, whether or not the sentence was suspended.

Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said 
the Supreme Court ruling was ‘dangerous’. He added: ‘With huge numbers 
of serious, repeat offenders avoiding prison it is time for courts to be
 tougher on criminals, not recommending that criminal records can be 
wiped clean.’ Certain offences for which people are convicted or 
cautioned will still stay on the record indefinitely, including all 
serious sexual and violent crimes and all terrorism offences.

However, under the new rules, adult offenders will see convictions for 
burglary, shoplifting or common assault, for instance, cleared from 
their record after 11 years, and cautions after six years, as long as 
they were not jailed and have not reoffended.

Young offenders will have no visible conviction record after five-and-a-half years, and no caution record after two years.

This will mean employers will not be able to learn about these offences unless the applicant tells them.

The case before the Supreme  Court involved two people who had jobs 
jeopardised because they  had been reprimanded for  minor crimes.

Lawyers for Theresa May and Chris Grayling warned that the ruling could affect hundreds of thousands of job applications where convictions were 'plainly relevant'

One man, known only as T, had been forced to disclose police warnings he
 received aged 11 in 2002 in connection with the alleged theft of two 
bicycles when he applied for a job aged 17 which could have involved 
working with children.

A woman, identified as JB, was refused a job in a care home eight years 
after receiving a caution for stealing a packet of false fingernails 
from a shop. The Supreme Court said the disclosures the pair had been 
forced to make were not based on any rational assessment of risk.

Rebecca Hilsenrath, of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: 
‘This judgment sensibly  recognises that people should not  be haunted 
forever by minor childhood offences.’

Meanwhile, a parliamentary inquiry led by Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile has 
said children who commit minor offences should have their record wiped 
clean when they turn 18.
