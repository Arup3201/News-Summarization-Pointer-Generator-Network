For the ultimate wind-in-the-hair thrill, British luxury car-maker Bentley has today unleashed the world’s fastest four-seater convertible with a top speed of 202mph.

The new Bentley Continental GT Speed cabriolet can hit 60mph in just 4 seconds and 100mph in just over 9 seconds – all with the top down.

And it will be in UK showrooms this Spring with a price of £160,000 following its official global unveiling at this month’s Detroit Motor Show in the USA on January 14.

'Designed for those who accept no compromise': The new Bentley Continental GT Speed is the world's fastest four-seater convertible with a top speed of 202mph

New launch: The Bentley Continental GT Speed will be on sale in the UK with a £160,000 price tag this spring

It described the new car as its ‘performance flagship convertible’.

Bentley chairman and chief executive Dr Wolfgang Schreiber said: 'The new GT Speed Convertible will appeal to drivers who seek the sensory thrills of the world’s fastest four-seat soft-top and the practicality of a year-round Grand Tourer, together with unrivalled levels of luxury and refinement.

'It is designed for those who accept no compromise.'

Bentley is based in Crewe, Cheshire, where it employs 4,000 people, builds more than 6,000 cars a year and exports £500m of vehicles abroad, including to China, the USA and the Middle East. It is  now owned by German car-giant Volkswagen.

A Bentley spokesman said: ’The new GT Speed Convertible combines the sensory pleasures of roof-down luxury touring with  shattering performance.

‘And in true Bentley style, no compromises have been made in craftsmanship, luxury or refinement to deliver this unrivalled performance.’

Super-charged: The Bentley Continental GT Speed is powered by a 6.0litre twin turbo-charged W12 engine with 616 brake horse-power - the equivalent of six Ford Fiestas

Driving in the fast lane: The cabriolet can reach 60mph in just 4 seconds and 100mph in just over 9 seconds with the top down

The new car promises ‘the thrill of the open road, 365 days a year’. It offers the luxury and refinement of a coupé yet transforms into a head-turning open tourer at the touch of a button as the four-layer hood.

It has been ‘exhaustively tested’ in all conditions from -30°C to +50°C or more: ’It resists even monsoon-force rain and maintains comfortable, draught-free warmth even on the coldest days. ‘

It even features a warm-air ‘neck warmer’ to make open air driving ‘an appealing and comfortable prospect even on the cooler days of spring and autumn'.

Gears: 8-speed automatic with  ‘quickshift’ and  wheel-mounded F1 style paddles

The Bentley spokesman noted: ‘With 
the hood down, the Continental GT Speed convertible offers sensational 
performance with the sensory amplification of open-air motoring. Hood 
up, it’s as practical a year-round proposition as its coupé stablemate.’

‘It is a Bentley that can tackle sun-drenched boulevard or snowy alpine pass with equal aplomb.’

It is propelled along the road by a giant 6.0 litre twin turbo-charged  W12 engine developing 616brake horse-power – equivalent to about six Ford Fiestas – linked to an eight speed automatic gear-box.

Permanent all-wheel drive means it sticks to the road like glue while the powerful engine means it  provides  ‘effortless, refined performance at all times’.

And although it delivers a 15 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency, don’t hold your breath for low running costs. It still only manages a gas-guzzling average 19 miles to the gallon  - dropping to 12mpg around town, thought it does creep up to 27mpg when cruising.

Outside with its muscular stance, the winged ‘B’ badge set upon a black enamel backgroundcrowns the radiator shell. It has exclusive 21-inch alloy wheels, dark-tint grilles and ‘rifled’ exhaust  pipes. Bentley promises  enhanced performance accentuated ‘by a glorious baritone snarl from the free-breathing exhaust.’

Inside its four-seat handcrafted cabin, the GT Speed convertible features styling by Mulliner which blends contemporary luxury with a sporting character and distinctive diamond-quilted hide upholstery, as well as exclusive tread-plates featuring the ‘Speed’ legend.

For safety the  Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system helps keep the beast on the road at speed.

However for an even more engaging drive, switching the gear selector to ‘Sport’ mode delivers an even  sharper throttle response, gear-shifting at higher engine speeds and jumps back down through the gears – directly from 8th to 4th fear for instance -  to provide  accessible acceleration.

The information and entertainment system features a sophisticated sat-nav system, live traffic data and digital radio, as well as the facility to play music via an iPod, MP3 player, the car’s own six-disc CD changer or SD card.
