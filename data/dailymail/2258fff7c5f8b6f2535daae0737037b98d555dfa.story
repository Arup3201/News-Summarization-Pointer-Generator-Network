John Terry may be on holiday but the Chelsea captain is not resting on his laurels.

While the rest of his family were enjoying a spot of skiing on Monday, Terry went off to do some altitude running in the mountains at a height of 2,700 metres (8,860 feet).

Terry posted a short Instagram video of his run with the caption: 'Done a few mountain runs whilst the family was skiing. Altitude Running at 2700 metres was ridiculously hard.'

And during the video, the 34-year-old said: 'Little run just by the lake. Tough going, this.'

Terry is on a short holiday after he was rested for Chelsea's 3-0 FA Cup third-round victory against Watford on Sunday.

The Blues were not at their best but they comfortably progressed in the end thanks to goals from Willian, Loic Remy and Kurt Zouma.

Chelsea had made a total of eight changes following their New Year's Day defeat to Tottenham and Mourinho admitted he had gambled in leaving Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas out of the squad, with Willian and Costa his insurance policy on the bench.

'I was worried at half-time because the game was always under control, but we weren't strong enough to score and when you don't score in these matches there is a risk,' Mourinho said.

'We were always in control but the first half was a bit sad, so it was important for us to make changes and try to change the game. William and Diego did well.

'We had them on the bench because we knew it could be a risk and it was a risk. The first half was 0-0. I thought to win the game we needed to change some players and the system.'
