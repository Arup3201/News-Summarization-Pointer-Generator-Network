Millions of Americans came out in force to celebrate Independence Day - and even a hurricane couldn't stop them.

Hurricane Arthur, the first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season moved away from New York and towards New England Friday as it was downgraded from Category II to a Category I, and most people on large cities along the seaboard refused to let the storm dampen their Independence Day enthusiasm.

The hurricane, initially forecast to drench New York, fizzled out before it ever got going. The showers were predicted to last until at least 9pm, but never amounted to more than a drizzle.

Thousands of people began lining the city's East River in both Manhattan and Brooklyn in the hours leading up to the annual Macy's Fireworks show, said to be the country's largest.

Millions lined up along the East River in New York to watch the annual Macy's fireworks display on the Brooklyn Bridge

People gathered on both the Manhattan and Brooklyn sides of the bridge to see the sky light up in an array of colours on July 4

Rain had been forecast and threatened to dampen the New York City fireworks but it never amounted to more than drizzle and the display dazzled the Manhattan skyline

A 25-minute show of reds, whites and blues lit up the sky from three barges on the water, sandwiched between Brooklyn and lower Manhattan - and even some from the Brooklyn Bridge itself

The show goes on: Organizers moved the Macy's fireworks barges down the East River from their planned launch because of rip tides, but the show went off without any other issues

Macy's says more than 1,600 shells were launched per minute during the 25-minute display.

One World Trade Center marked the holiday by lighting its 400-foot antenna red, white and blue.

Earlier in the day, Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut dropped to one knee and proposed to his longtime girlfriend before Friday's annual Nathan's hot dog eating contest on Coney Island, and then packed away 61 franks and buns to hold onto his coveted mustard yellow winner's belt. It was the eight year in a row he won the contest.

Washington D.C. was far enough inland to enjoy a picturesque holiday. President Barack Obama held the annual White House barbecue for soldiers and veterans, and the capitol's fireworks show light up the sky after sundown.

The barbecue, sponsored by the USO, also featured a concert by recording artist Pitbull.

Obama's daughter Malia, who was born on July 4, also celebrated her 16th birthday.

Further north, in New England, the rain 
will last into Saturday morning. Cape Cod and 
Nantucket, where hundreds of thousands of tourists are spending their 
Independence Day holiday, are under a tropical storm warning.

On
 North Carolina's Outer Banks, which were hit by the brunt of the storm, 
Arthur left behind flooding, washed out roads, damaged homes and more 
than 41,000 without power on Friday morning, but the beaches were 
reopened by the holiday.

'The
 North Carolina beaches are open for business and they're open for 
tourists,' Gov. Pat McCrory said. 'The umbrellas are going up as we 
speak right now.'

Tens
 of thousands evacuated the barrier island chain and fled inland ahead 
of the storm. There were no deaths and few injuries reported, and 
McCrory even attended a parade in Southport.

Jesse and Carol Wray could see outside their home in Salvo on North Carolina Highway 12 that the road was submerged under several feet of water Friday morning. The six-foot-tall lamppost at the end of their driveway was under water except for its top, and that was after the sound a quarter-mile away receded several feet since first light, said Jesse Wray, 68, a retired Norfolk, Virginia, firefighter.

'I'm surprised that it got this bad. There's all kind of debris floating around here. I know a lot of people who lost their houses around here' if they were built on the ground instead of elevated, Jesse Wray said. Wray's home is on pilings nine feet off the ground and avoided water inside.

Camper trailers were tossed around like toys by the flood waters that gushed across much of the Outer Banks Thursday night

Almost 20,000 people were without power this morning as the storm came ashore late last night, shortly after being upgraded to Category II

About seven
 miles south on the island, Frank Folb, 70, said his brick home on a 
rise in Buxton suffered no damage. Tomato plants in his garden were 
twisted and broken, but 'overall it's not bad,' he said. 'I've been 
losing electricity but I slept through the night pretty well.'

Paul
 Wernock said water about 3 feet deep surrounded his Rodanthe, North 
Carolina, home but was receding early Friday. "We have one giant mess" 
from tree damage and debris, but no obvious structural damage to homes 
on his side street, he said.

Four cruise ships were also diverted to avoid the path of the storm. Norwegian Gem cancelled a scheduled port of call at Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas due to the incoming storm.

Three ships operated by Royal Caribbean also cancelled scheduled stops at CocoCay in the Bahamas in a bid to move on and stay ahead of Hurricane Arthur and its surrounding high winds and rain.

Majesty of the Seas, Enchantment of the Seas and Grandeur of the Seas will instead spend extra time at sea.

More than 20,000 customers were without power near North Carolina's coast early on Friday morning, according to utility Duke Energy.

Officials in many cities prepared for the worst. The
 annual Boston Pops Fourth of July concert and fireworks
show was rescheduled for Thursday because of potential heavy rain from 
Arthur. The fireworks thundered and flashed over the Charles River, just
 beating the storm.

Before that Beach 
Boys founder Mike Love, Broadway star Megan Hilty and the Boston 
Children's Chorus made their way through lively performances and 
thousands of revelers sang along to patriotic songs.

Augusta,
 Maine, moved its fireworks display to Aug. 2 to coincide with an annual
 festival, while several New Hampshire cities moved their fireworks 
shows to either Saturday or Sunday. In New Jersey, Atlantic City and 
Ocean City moved their fireworks to Sunday.
