The US military is to shrink its presence in Britain, closing three bases and slashing thousands of roles as part of a major shake-up of its overseas deployments.

The closure of RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk alongside RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire will see the number of US military personnel drop by around 2,000.

Hundreds of British civilian workers will also lose their jobs as part of the cost-cutting.

Pentagon officials said that the US presence at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk – the largest US Air Force combat base in Europe – will be beefed up with two squadrons comprising 48 of the new Lockheed Martin Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters, which will arrive by 2020. 

The closures are expected to save £320m ($500m) a year across Europe, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said.

He added: 'I know this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations. I value the tremendous support they have provided us for decades.'

RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk is an historic airbase used by the U.S to defend Britain since 1950.

It was opened in 1934 and went on to play a key part in WWII and the Cold War.

Throughout the war, the base was involved in most of RAF Bomber Command's offensives against Germany. The base withstood several attacks by the German Luftwaffe, but was never put out of commission.

By the end of the war, aircraft from RAF Mildenhall and its satellite airfields dropped more than 23,000 tons of explosives, laid 2,000 mines in enemy waters, and flew more than 8,000 sorties.

After the war, RAF Mildenhall flew home prisoners of war and took part in other humanitarian missions.

It is currently home to 3,200 military personnel, including the 352nd Special operations Group - the US special forces which fly secret missions - and the 100th Air Refuelling Wing, a fleet of air-to-air refuelling tankers.

The latter are some of the most important elements of the U.S Air Force as they enable aircraft to reach targets and to remain over combat zones for the duration of the mission.

RAF Alconbury, based in Huntingdon, and RAF Molesworth, near Molesworth, Cambridgeshire - once home to Cold War cruise missiles - are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying. 

They are the last Second World War-era Eighth Air Force bases in Britain that are still actively in use.

Along with RAF Upwood, they are considered the 'Tri-Base Area' due to their close geographic proximity. 

RAF Mildenhall is the biggest base to close among 15 installations across Europe.

The historic airfield is home to the 100th Air Refuelling Wing, which flies KC-135R tankers used for mid-air refuelling duties, as well as the 352nd Special Operations Group, which flies secret missions with its C-130 transport planes and CV-22 Osprey tiltrotors – a cross between an aircraft and helicopter.

Mildenhall's special forces aircraft will be moved to Germany, the refuelling tankers will go to Germany but RC-135 surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft are set to move elsewhere in the UK.

The Pentagon's European Infrastructure Consolidation review will see some 3,200 people moved from Mildenhall, with 400-500 civilian posts under threat. An additional 1,200 additional servicemen will go to Lakenheath to support the F-35.

The US Department of Defense said the decision to base American F-35 aircraft in the UK reflected 'the closeness of the US-UK defense relationship and the military value of basing in the UK'. 

It added: 'The presence of U.S. F-35s at RAF Lakenheath will deepen our already close partnership and offer new opportunities for collaboration between the U.S. and UK.'

Together, Lakenheath and Mildenhall contribute some £500million to the East Anglian economy each year and enjoy strong support from local people, many of whom work on the bases.

Matthew Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, said: 'Mildenhall has a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force. With this deep history in mind news of the proposed closure of Mildenhall will come as a shock to many. 

'I will do everything in my power to support those affected, and to make sure that Mildenhall gets the support it needs to adjust. I have met with the Defence Secretary, and others in Government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community.

'We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs, councils, the Ministry of Defence, and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.'

Last year, the two bases were flagged for potential closure by a RAND Corporation report into military cost-cutting.

The Pentagon was understood to be concerned that Lakenheath and Mildenhall were too far away from Middle East trouble sports such as Iraq and Syria.

But recent events in Ukraine and the potential for a new Cold War with Russia may have prompted a rethink, with the 48th Fighter Wing considered a vital outpost of US air power able to deploy its jets anywhere in the world with fewer than 24-hours notice.

The unit was recently sent to Lithuania to support the NATO North Atlantic alliance's Baltic air patrol mission and has established a reputation for always being among the first on the front line, having flown combat missions in both Iraq wars, Afghanistan and Libya.

Lakenheath already has 4,500 military personnel and 2,000 civilians, who do everything from serving coffee in the restaurants to scaring birds away from its 9,000ft-long runway.

Colonel Robert Novotny, commander of Lakenheath's 48th Fighter Wing, recently told the Mail he had not read the RAND report, adding: 'Commanders and politicians are going to make the decision. I don't think we're going anywhere any time soon.'

Col Novotny said: 'This base has more fighter aircraft than almost all the rest of the other American bases in Europe. This base as a combat search and rescue unit that does not exist anywhere else in Europe. You can't just replace that capability.'

The change in US presence comes as Britain's government is under pressure to retain 2per cent of its annual spending on defence.

Independent defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said: 'The decision by the US is an object lesson for the UK government just as it is for those of our NATO allies that we must place a much greater emphasis on ensuring we have sufficient capability to defend ourselves.'
