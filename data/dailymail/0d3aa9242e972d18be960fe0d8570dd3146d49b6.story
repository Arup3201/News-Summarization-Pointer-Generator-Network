Roman Abramovich is about to lose his title as the owner of the world's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted for the first time.

The £400million mega-yacht, known only as Project Azzam, will measure a staggering 590ft (180m) - longer than some cruise ships - when it is completed.

This will make the super-secretive yacht around 54ft (17.5m) longer than the Eclipse, which is Chelsea-owning oligarch Abramovich's current flagship vessel.

Ousted: But Mr Abramovich is about to lose his title as the owner of the world's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted in Germany last month

On the move: The yacht, which was minus its bow section, was quickly taken to the larger 220-metre dock so engineers could continue the awesome project

Huge: Eclipse, owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Mr Abramovich, has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine

It is rumoured the boat, which is longer than some cruise ships, has been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family.

Stunned
 photographers captured the vessel as it was transported out of the 
170-metre dry dock at German shipbuilder Lurssen's yard because it had 
become too large.

Peter
 Seyfferth, from TheYachtPhoto.com, said: 'The photographers who took 
the pictures of Azzam were overwhelmed by the size of it.

Super-secretive: The £400million megayacht, known only as Project Azzam, is rumoured to have been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family

Rumours: There has been suggestions that the boat, which will be longer than some cruise ships, has been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family

Prediction: Experts say that if it has been commissioned for the Saudi Royal Family it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often

Project Azzam's fuel tank will be able to hold 1million litres - with the vessel staffed by up to 50 of the best staff for 365 days of the year.

The Eclipse has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine.

Both yachts are confined to just a handful of areas in the world that can accomdate a boat of such size, including Monaco and Antibes.

'It is difficult to say at this stage but I think it will be a very elegant yacht and more interesting looking then Eclipse.

'There appears to be a special propulsion system which should make it one of the fastest yachts out there.

'In terms of length, we think it will be around 180-metres which makes it longer than some cruise ships.

'If it has been commissioned for the Saudi Royal Family it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often. It is more of a question of prestige, to have the world's largest yacht.'

Official details on megayachts such as Project Azzam and Abramovich's Eclipse are notoriously sketchy due to confidentiality agreements set up between the builders and their customers.

But they are known to have incredible security systems and it is not uncommon for them to be flanked by smaller yachts and submarines which help make up a billionaire's flotilla.

It is thought a yacht this size will 
cost its new owner around £400million - and that is just the initial 
payment with the yacht having astronomical running costs.

The
 yacht's fuel tank will be able to hold a staggering one million litres 
while the owner will have to pay 50 of the best staff in the world to 
man it 365 days of the year.

Dwarfing: Project Azzam made surrounding boats look tiny as it was taken from one dock to another

Home: When the yacht is completed next year it is most likely to be moored on the French Riviera

Massive: There will be just two locations which can accommodate a boat of such size - Monaco and Antibes

Lurssen,
 which is building Azzam, has refused to discuss the top secret yacht 
although rumours in the industry are that is being build for Saudi 
billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal.

Al-Waleed, 57, is worth around £10 billion and a member of the Saudi Royal Family.

If he is the owner, he is thought to have ordered the new toy as a replacement for his Kingdom 5KR yacht which he has owned for the past 20-years.

When the yacht is completed next year it is most likely to be moored on the French Riviera but there will be just two locations which can accommodate a boat of such size - Monaco and Antibes.
