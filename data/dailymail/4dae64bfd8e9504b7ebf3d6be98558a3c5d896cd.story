Julia Marshall-Wessendorf, 37, was diagnosed with MS in 2010 after an MRI scan revealed lesions on her brain and spine

A mother-of-three who spent two years being treated for multiple sclerosis has been cured with a simple course of antibiotics – after it was revealed that her symptoms were actually caused by a tick bite.

Julia Marshall-Wessendorf, 37, was facing life in a wheelchair after being mistakenly diagnosed with MS, a condition which attacks the central nervous system.

But when her symptoms deteriorated, she carried out her own research and discovered she may have been infected with Lyme disease following a bite from a parasitic tick.

Now, after years of expensive drug therapy and injections for MS, a simple course of antibiotics has cleared all of her symptoms.

Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf's troubles first started in 2010 after she went to her GP complaining of a numb finger two months after the birth of her daughter, Peggy.

She initially thought she had trapped a nerve carrying newborn Peggy around, but when she was sent to a neurologist she began to worry.

An extensive MRI revealed lesions on her brain and spinal cord, consistent with MS.

‘Initially,
 I was really glad of the diagnosis because MS was a well-recognised 
illness and a lot of money had been put into researching it and 
providing medication,’ Ms Marshall-Wessendorf, from  from Bath, 
Somerset.

‘In hindsight, I wonder if the diagnosis 
was too quick - and now I know it is Lyme disease, I wish I had pushed 
further for more tests.’

It was only when she started to get 
muscle pains - which she was told were not symptoms of MS - that her 
suspicions were roused. She then spoke to a friend who told her to check
 for the tick-borne disease.

She spent two years on a grueling drug regime for MS before developing other symptoms which were not consistent with the disease. She did some of her own research and realised she could have Lyme disease

Ms Marshall-Wessendorf, a trained landscape architect, could 
not find a bite on her body, but, after undertaking some research, she 
learnt she could have been bitten years ago.

The mother, originally from Germany, said: ‘Ticks are very common in Germany. You are told about them from a very young age.

‘Once you get bitten you might have a
 rash or flu-like symptoms quite quickly, but, if for some reason 
you don't get the rash, you might think you are a bit under the weather.

‘But
 if it is not treated it travels through your body and can then cause 
long term damage because it can cross the blood, brain barrier. That is 
how a tick bite can be mistaken for MS.

‘I spoke to a friend in Germany who told me they tested for Lyme disease before ever diagnosing MS.

‘It can lie dormant in you for years 
so it could have been in my system for a while. I don't think it is very
 recent. I'm convinced I have had it for years.’

She went to see her doctor who carried out tests which confirmed her suspicions. Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf believes that she was bitten by a tick many years ago as they are common in her native Germany

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by infected ticks - most of which are found in woodland or heath areas.

The first symptom tends to be a rash that is red and circular around the area of the bite.

Someone who is newly infected may also develop flu-like symptoms.

If it is left untreated, Lyme disease can cause further symptoms including muscle pain, joint swelling and neurological symptoms such as temporary paralysis of the facial muscles.

In the later stages, the disease can also cause chronic fatigue.

It is usually treated with antibiotics.

It affects about 2,000 to 3,000 people in the UK every year.

Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf took her findings to her doctor and demanded a Lyme disease test, which came back negative.

But while another more detailed test was taken and sent to a specialist in America, she asked for antibiotics for the disease just in case.

Within four days, her symptoms had disappeared and just a month later the test came back positive for Lyme disease.

Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf, who lives 
with husband Jack, 37, and her three children Betty, six, Albert, four, 
and Peggy, two, is now calling for greater awareness to be made of the 
tiny parasites.

She said: ‘It is brilliant not to have MS. It is like a black 
cloud hanging over you. You don't know what is coming.

‘They
 tell you, you may never have a relapse but then you read that you could
 be in a wheelchair in 10 years. I used to look at my children and 
think, “I want to be there for you and I won't be able to”.

‘Psychologically, with Lyme disease, you know what you are fighting, you know what can happen and you know how to stop it.

‘With MS that was never the case.

‘The medicine for MS is so expensive too. I was injecting myself with it every other day, which is not pleasant.

‘I still have £2,500 worth of medication left which has to be destroyed now. It would have been so much cheaper to test for Lyme disease at the start of the process.

‘It is so important to get the message out about it. Especially with children playing outside at this time of year, ticks live in grass and could bite anyone at any point.

‘More needs to be done in this country to spread awareness; it could save so much hassle, worry and heartache.’
