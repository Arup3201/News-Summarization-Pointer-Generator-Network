It's a global brand that is enjoying billions of pounds worth of profits.

And it appears that Apple's phenomenal success is down to one Irish woman - an accountant called Cathy Kearney.

One of the heads of Apple's Europe operation, the 49-year-old is believed to be a driving force behind the company's staggering financial success.

The U.S Senate said the company paid little or nothing on tens of billions of dollars in profits stashed in Irish subsidiaries

A Cork-based Apple satellite company that she is director of reportedly earned $22 billion in 2011 â€“ but paid just $10 million in taxes.

It is this wealth of profits which has come under close scrutiny by U.S. officials eager to discover how the company has made so much money.

Apple CEO Tim Cook answered probing question's about the company's tax strategy

Apple uses five companies located in Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, says a 40-page report issued by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

The probe, which saw Apple chief Tim Cook defending the brand before a Senate panel last week, discovered that Apple employs a group of affiliate companies outside America to allegedly avoid paying tax.

The companies are located at the same address in Cork and they share members of their boards of directors - including media-shy Cathy Kearney, who has refused in the past to have her photo published.

While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country.

That means the other three aren't legally required to pay taxes in Ireland because they aren't managed or controlled in that country, in Apple's view.

The company can legally shift profits to its different operations, which results in it paying less tax, the Guardian reported.

Apple's arrangement has allowed it to
pay just 1.9 per cent tax on its $37 billion in overseas profits in 
2012, despite the fact that the average tax rate for countries in its 
main markets was 24 per cent last year, says the report.

The subcommittee's report estimates 
that Apple avoided at least $3.5 billion in US taxes in 2011 and $9 
billion in 2012 by using the tactic.

Cathy Kearney, a director of one of the subsidiary companies in Hollyhill, Cork, is said to be a 'driving force' behind the brand's success

Apple's tax strategy has allegedly meant that the Cork-born accountant has had to answer U.S officials' questions about Apple's tax payments.

In a poll two years ago, the executive's 'shrewd direction' was hailed as one of the main reason's the company has enjoyed so much profit.

At the panel meeting which saw Apple boss Tim Cook denied the company was a 'tax dodger', subcommittee member Senator Carl Levi said: 'Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven.

'Apple sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.'

Former presidential candidate John McCain said that while Apple claims to be the biggest U.S. corporate taxpayer, it is also 'among America's largest tax avoiders.'

Apple says it complies with the law and pays 'an extraordinary amount' of tax.

In an earlier statement the company said: 'Apple does not use tax gimmicks.

'And Apple pays all its required taxes, both in this country and abroad.'

It declined to make any further comment to the MailOnline when asked to respond about Cathy Kearney.
