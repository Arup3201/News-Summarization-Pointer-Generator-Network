It was a Pandora's Box of eccentricity and glamor.

Open for just 33 months from 1977 to 1981, Studio 54 remains the ultimate discotheque.

Only the beautiful, famous and socially-connected could be sure of entry.

The lucky partygoers that made it into the New York City establishment reveled among celebrities, blaring music, champagne, bubbles, costumes, art, theater - and occasionally animals.

Hundreds, however, never managed to pass the red velvet rope.

For those left out in the cold, award-winning photographer Tod Papageorge was there - and has now compiled the madness into a book.

Here is a taste of his spectacular insights.

Incredible: These three white-clad partygoers blow bubbles from a podium in Studio 54 at one of the club's typically wild nights

Fabulous: Men and women descended on the hot spot, which was open for just 33 months, in elaborate and spectacular costumes

Raucous: Hundreds of New Yorkers would queue to get past the red velvet rope into the vibrant and roaring events every week

An inside glimpse: Award-winning photographer Tod Papageorge, known for his Vietnam war photos, got in with his camera

Only the famous, socially connected, or beautiful could assume they’d be shooed around the flock of hopefuls, Papageorge says

The go-to place: The reputation of Studio 54 mushroomed within weeks as A-listers flocked to be at the epicenter of America's night life

Elaborate: Papageorge describes how the inside of the nightclub could seem like Caliban's cave or a harem

Forever a performance: The space on the Upper West Side, formerly an opera house, was crammed full of beautifully made up people

Suited up: These suave gentlemen were just two of the hundreds Papageorge encountered during his project

Wild: Awash with drugs, kissing couples, and four tons of glitter, the nightclub made $7 million in its first year alone

Pivotal: The club played a formative role in the growth of disco music and nightclub culture before it was sold

Unpredictable crowd: Adults of all ages, styles and parts of the world would flock to the club, arguably the best-known on the globe

Fashion capital: Venezuela-American fashion designer Carolina Herrera, who now designs for Michelle Obama, coated in glitter at the club

Let the drinks flow: Bottles and glasses littered the rooms as the best of the best clustered together

Glamorous: A man wearing a floor-length black velvet coat stares at Papageorge surrounded by suited partygoers

What a look: One woman came to the club in a head-to-toe glitter ensemble with Egyptian-inspired head piece for one of the events

Working in Studio 54: This is the cover of Papageorge's book which comprises 66 photographs from the iconic club
