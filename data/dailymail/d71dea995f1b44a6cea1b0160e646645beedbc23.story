Owning an e-Reader could get considerably cheaper as Asda has struck the first blow in a price war, lowering the price of the hit Kobo to just £50.

Amazon's cheapest Kindle model is £89, and Kindle Touch is £109.

Further cuts are highly possible, as can retailers continue to make money after purchase as readers buy books via the gadgets' built-in book stores.

The Kobo: The e-Reader has the same screen as Amazon's Kindle, offers access to a library of two million books via a built-in store - but is much more 'liberal' about users buying from other e-shops

Kobo already has five million customers worldwide and is the biggest eBook company in both Canada and Australia.

The gadget has the same screen as the market-leading Kindle, works very similartly, and offers consumers more choice in terms of shops to buy new books from.

The gadget offers access to the largest eBook catalogue in the UK, with more than 2.2million titles and one million free books.

The Kobo eReader is the same 
price as the latest basic Kindle.

It weighs 221g and can store up to 
10,000 eBooks.

Kobo's eReader - available through WHSmith stores from next week - is £110, offers 2.2 million books and is the first widely available touchscreen wi-fi reader in the UK. A non-touch version is available for £89
