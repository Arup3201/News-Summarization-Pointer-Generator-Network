Former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and his family broke down in tears Thursday as a jury read its decision that he and his wife did sell the influence of the office to a wealthy vitamin executive seeking legitimacy for his company's signature product.

'Gut wrenching sobs' rang out in the courtroom as verdicts on the 13 counts, most of them guilty, were read to the courtroom.

As the once popular governor was found guilty on 11 counts, he wept with his face buried in his hands. His wife was found guilt on nine counts.

Three of the couples' five children were also among those family members breaking down in the Richmond courtroom as they held hands and sobbed along with the chorus of guilty verdicts.

After the fall: Jurors on Thursday decided former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and his wife did sell the influence of the office to a wealthy vitamin executive. McDonnell is seen here with his son, getting into a car just after he was found guilty

'My trust remains in the Lord': The ex-governor, who claimed during the trial to have moved in with a priest,  gave reporters very little to the reporters who were mobbed outside the courtroom at the trial's conclusion

Peddling influence: Maureen McDonnell (seen here after the verdicts were read) was found guilty on nine charges on Thursday relating her and her husband's relationship with a vitamin company executive

The torrent of emotions in the courtroom even left two of the jurors, who'd just helped all but guarantee the once-proud governor and his wife will see prison time, in tears themselves. 

According to NBC News, the governor and his wife will face sentencing January 6. 

Once considered one of America's most popular governors and even vetted to be running mate to Mitt Romney in 2012, McDonnell now faces as much as 25 years in prison.  

The man with the money: Jonnie Wiliams bought the McDonnells lavish gifts in exchange for favors and then got himself off the legal hook by testifying against them with immunity

The couple left the courtroom separately and remained apart. Bob McDonnell left first and walked into a witness waiting room.

A loudly weeping Maureen McDonnell came out later, hugging one of her daughters. She went into a separate waiting room.

'My trust remains in the Lord,' was about all the ex-governor told reporters who were mobbed outside the courtroom at the conclusion of the marathon trial.

Religion had become a theme during the proceedings for Mr. McDonnell, who claimed that his marriage with Maureen had crumbled and he'd moved in with a priest. 

Attorney's for McDonnell vowed to appeal. 

'This is a difficult and disappointing day for the commonwealth and its citizens. Public service frequently requires sacrifice and almost always requires financial sacrifice,' said Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia.

The jurors all declined to speak to reporters as they left the courthouse through a back door.

'I just want to go home,' said one unidentified juror.

CEO Jonnie Williams, the prosecution's star witness, testified under immunity that he spent lavishly on the McDonnells only to secure their help promoting and obtaining state-backed research for Star's tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory, Anatabloc. 

Bob McDonnell testified he did nothing other than extend routine political courtesies to Williams. Maureen McDonnell did not testify.

Williams' immunity deal bars his prosecution not only for his dealings with the McDonnells, but also for possible securities fraud violations that were investigated by a separate grand jury.

McDonnell's attorney, Henry Asbill, said in closing arguments Friday that the unusually generous immunity deal was Williams' 'greatest con.' Prosecutor Michael Dry countered that because of the agreement, Williams had no reason to lie on the witness stand. 

Could have had it all: Once-popular McDonnell had the opportunity to plead guilty to just a single charge, which he passed up and was subsequently tried on 13 charges. On Thursday he was found guilty of all but two

Zoo: McDonnell was once one of the most beloved governors in America and his popularity helped to turn the trial into an all-out media spectacle as viewers clamored to know more about the fallen politician's shady dealings

Emotional: The McDonnell children, including daughter Rachel at right, were among the family members in tears as a chorus of guilty verdicts were read Thursday in a Richmond courtroom

Spencer told the jury that the testimony of a witness who is granted immunity must be more closely examined than testimony of other witnesses. The heightened scrutiny is required to determine whether the testimony of the immunized witness is 'affected by self-interest,' he said.

The judge also walked the jury through the charges, including 'honest services fraud' and conspiracy to commit such an offense. 

He also said a corrupt agreement need not be stated explicitly by the conspirators and that it doesn't matter whether the defendant would have done favors absent a bribe.

Spencer also told jurors — who heard from three character witnesses, two for Bob McDonnell and one for his wife — that 'evidence of good character alone may create a reasonable doubt as to a defendant's guilt.'

The defense argued that the McDonnells' marriage was in such shambles that the couple could not have conspired because they were barely speaking. Maureen McDonnell's attorney said the first lady developed a 'crush' on Williams, who capitalized on her vulnerability and further poisoned her marriage. 

The McDonnells attended several events promoting Anatabloc and hosted an event at the governor's mansion that Star billed as a product launch. The former governor also arranged meetings for Williams with administration officials, although none resulted in action.

Worth it? Among Williams' gifts to the family was a nearly $20,000 New York City shopping spree of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell

Going for a spin: Williams told prosecutors that he lent the McDonnells his Ferrari, among other favors

Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams testified under immunity that he spent freely on the McDonnells in order to secure their help promoting his supposed cure-all, the tobacco-derived anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. 

Among the gifts were:

Nearly $20,000 in designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell

A $6,500 Rolex watch for her husband

$15,000 in catering for one of their daughter's wedding

Free vacations

Free golf outings

Free spins in Williams' Ferrari

Williams also provided three loans totaling $120,000
