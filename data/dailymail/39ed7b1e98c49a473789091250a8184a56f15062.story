The world's richest 80 billionaires have been revealed today - but only one of them is British.

Indian-born British siblings Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja are the 66th richest people on the globe and are worth an estimated £9.1billion ($13.9billion). 

Of the top 80 billionaires - a group who will own more than 50 per cent of global wealth by next year according to Oxfam - 35 are from the United States.

At 94 in the world is the UK's richest landlord Gerald Grosvenor - the 6th Duke of Westminster and godfather to Prince William -  who is worth an estimated £7.9billion ($12billion). At 119 in the list are property moguls David and Simon Reuben, right, worth £6.7billion ($10.2billion)

Discovery: Oxfam has said that the richest one per cent of the world's population will own more than the combined wealth of the other 99% by next year

According to the Forbes list, the five wealthiest people in the world are Bill Gates (net worth $76 billion), Carlos Slim Helu (net worth $72 billion), Amancio Ortega (net worth $64 billion), Warren Buffett (net worth $58.2 billion), and Larry Ellison (net worth $48 billion).

492 people out of the 1,645 billionaires on the 2014 Forbes list are US citizens. Aside from Slim Helu and Ortega - who are from Mexico and Spain, respectively - all the billionaires in the top ten are Americans.

Indian-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja top the list of the UK's wealthiest billionaires and the London-based pair run the global conglomerate Hinduja Group.

The Hinduja brothers' pursuit of British citizenship embroiled the Labour party in scandal and cost two Blair ministers their jobs. 

The family have previously been implicated in an arms scandal in India their attempts to get British passports led to the resignation in 2001 of then Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson.

He had been accused of lobbying for those passports in return for £1million donations towards the cost of the Millennium Dome. 

They gave the cash to fund the attraction's Faith Zone.

Keith Vaz was also sacked when it emerged he had made representations on behalf of the Hinduja brothers as they applied for British citizenship. 

Days after he admitted doing so on their behalf in June 2001 he was dismissed. 

Their global conglomerate has a wide range of interests in businesses including bus manufacturing and banking.

The next wealthiest, at 94 in the world, is the UK's richest landlord, Gerald Grosvenor - the 6th Duke of Westminster and godfather to Prince William, who is worth an estimated £7.9billion ($12billion). At 119 in the list is David and Simon Reuben, worth £6.7billion ($10.2billion), who are property moguls.

But despite the top 80 richest people only containing one British family - the UK still remains the super-rich capital of the world.

A total of 104 billionaires now call Britain home, with a combined wealth of £301billion between them. It means the UK has more billionaires per head than any other country. 

The Hindujas are competing to be the richest followed by Russian business magnate Alisher Usmanov, believed to be worth £10.65billion.

A decade ago, a personal fortune of £700million was needed to be among Britain's 50 wealthiest people. The entry point to the UK top 50 today is £1.7billion, the Sunday Times Rich List found. 

There are 48 sterling-equivalent billionaires in Moscow, 43 in New York, 42 in San Francisco, 38 in Los Angeles and 34 in Hong Kong.

Britain's reputation as a financial capital and its relatively low tax regime have been credited for attracting 'non-dom' residents, keen to invest in property in London and the South East.

The country now has one billionaire for every 607,692 residents, compared to one for every 1,022,475 in the US, which has the second highest number of billionaires per capita. 

Political and business leaders gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this week are set to be challenged over the issue of the widening gap between the wealthiest and the rest.

A research paper released by Oxfam suggests the richest 1 per cent have seen their share of global assets rise from 44 per cent in 2009 to 48 per cent last year - with an average worth of 2.7 million dollars (£1.8 million) each. 

Oxfam said the 'very richest' of the top one per cent - the 80 individuals at the top of the Forbes Billionaires list - have seen their total net wealth rise from 1.3trillion dollars in 2010 to 1.9 trillion dollars last year.

The report added: 'The wealth of these 80 individuals is now the same as that owned by the bottom 50 per cent of the global population, such that 3.5 billion people share between them the same amount of wealth as that of these extremely wealthy 80 people.' 

Brothers: Charles Koch (left) and David Koch (right) each had a 2014 net worth of $40 billion according to the Forbes billionaires list

Among the wealthiest: (From left to right) Sheldon Adelson's 2014 net worth was $38 billion, Christy Walton's was$36.7 billion, and Jim Walton's was $34.7 billion

The combined wealth of the 80 richest billionaires is the same amount as that of the bottom 50% of the Earth's population - 3.5 billion people - Oxfam said in a new report

Oxfam's report explained that it calculated figures from Credit Suisse and based its list of wealthiest figures off Forbes' billionaires list, which was published in March 2014.  

'By 2014, the 80 people who top the Forbes rich list had a collective wealth of $1.9tn,' the charity's report said.

The charity is calling for a crackdown on tax avoidance by corporations and rich people, as well as increased investment in health and education and equal pay legislation.
