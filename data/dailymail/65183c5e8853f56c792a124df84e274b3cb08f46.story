A stricken luxury cruise liner with 100 British passengers on board has safely arrived in Malaysia after drifting in pirate-infested waters for 24 hours.

Escorted by two Malaysian patrol vessels, the brightly lit Azamara Quest made its way into Sandakan port at around 8.30pm local time (1.30pm BST) today with passengers seen standing on the decks.

Police and buses waited at the port to take passengers to various hotels. Consular officials from several countries, including the U.S. and Canada, were also present.

The Azamara Quest drifted off the 
southern Philippines after flames engulfed one of its engine rooms 
Friday, injuring five crew members.

The waters in that area are key hunting grounds for pirates and the Abu Sayyaf, a deadly Islamic militant group.

The Abu Sayyaf wants an independent 
Islamic nation in the south of Roman Catholic Philippines, and has been 
responsible for high profile kidnappings of westerners, including 
abducting tourists from a nearby Malaysian resort island in 2000.

No passengers were injured in the 
incident, but five crew members on board the ship suffered the effects 
of smoke inhalation, including one who needed hospital care.

The ship informed the Philippine 
coast guard yesterday that its power and propulsion had been restored 
and that it was moving slowly towards Sandakan, spokesman Lieutenant 
Commander Algier Ricafrente said.

Azamara Club Cruises said the ship then sailed at a top speed of only six knots towards 
Sandakan.

The company said in a statement: 
'Unfortunately, the ship has not been able to restore power to the air 
conditioning compressors.

'While this is a very difficult 
undertaking, the onboard team is diligently working to resolve this 
issue. The guest sentiment onboard continues to be calm and upbeat.'

It said company president Larry Pimentel would meet the passengers and crew personally in Sandakan.

'Dunkirk spirit': Passengers and crew were praised for staying calm and upbeat throughout the incident

The family of a British couple on board has praised the crew and said the passengers were displaying the 'Dunkirk spirit'.

Jeremy Scott, 45, of Pinner, 
Middlesex, said his parents, Valerie and Billy Scott, phoned him from 
the ship to tell him they were 'fine'.

'There is no panic, everybody is fine
and they are just getting on with it. It is the Dunkirk spirit and they
are making the best of the situation,' he said.

'The crew have been brilliant, they have done everything right.'

Mr Scott, who owns the luxury travel 
company B away, said it was the 60th cruise that his 71-year-old retired
financial adviser father and 70-year-old mother, from Chigwell, Essex, 
had embarked on.

He said he had received an email from his parents to say they were sailing towards Malaysia.
'They have said the staff and the captain have been fantastic,' he added.

The fire was contained in the engine 
room and was quickly put out, Azamara Club Cruises, which is owned by 
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, said in an earlier statement.

The captain of the ship mustered all passengers to the assembly stations as a precaution, it added.

Engineers had earlier managed to 
restore power to one of the liner's engines allowing it to re-establish 
air conditioning, running water, refrigeration and food preparation on 
board the ship.

The damage caused by the fire has 
meant that the remainder of the cruise will be cancelled once the ship 
has arrived in Sandakan, the company said.

The scheduled 17-night cruise had begun in Hong Kong on Monday and was due to finish in Singapore on April 12.

Tragedy: The Costa Concordia cruise ship crashed into rocks off the Italian coast earlier this year, leaving dozens dead

'As a gesture of goodwill and to 
thank our guests for their understanding, we will be providing all 
guests with a full refund for their cruise,' the company said in its 
statement.

'Azamara Club Cruises will also be 
providing each guest with a future cruise certificate for 100 per cent 
of the cruise fare paid for their March 26, 2012 Azamara Quest sailing.'

The Foreign Office said a consular team from the region would be sent to meet the ship when it docks.

The fire is the latest in a series of problems to hit cruise liners in recent months.

In January, 25 people died, with 
seven more people missing and presumed dead, after the Costa Concordia 
liner ran into a reef and capsized off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Six weeks later, another Costa cruise
ship, the Costa Allegra, was left adrift off the Seychelles in the 
Indian Ocean after fire broke out on board.

Both Costa ships are part of Costa Crociere, SpA, a subsidiary of Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator.
