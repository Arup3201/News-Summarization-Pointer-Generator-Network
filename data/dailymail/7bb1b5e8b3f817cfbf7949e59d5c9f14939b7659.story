New York City may be known for its luxury skyscrapers and bustling streets, but just a few miles south of Manhattan, there is an altogether different sight to behold.

Languishing in the water just off Staten Island, scores of boats are left to rust in a little-known ship graveyard - just a stone's throw from the city's lights.  

Images captured by US photographer Gordon Donovan reveal the haunting scenes at the Arthur Kill Ship Graveyard in Rossville, Staten Island, which is only accessible by meandering through a cemetery and knocking on private homes to ask for permission to pass.

The photographs show great hunks of metal languishing in the water on the south side of Staten Island, which is fewer than 20 miles from Manhattan and 18 miles from Brooklyn.

Left to rust: The shipyard harbors disused and decommissioned ferries, tugboats, warships and barges that are left at the site until they are dismantled or salvaged

Final resting place: Another image by Gordon Donovan shows the rusting and peeling paint of a retired service vessel in shallow waters of the Arthur Kill

The dumping ground, which is one of the largest marine scrap yards on the East Coast, harbors disused and decommissioned ferries, tugboats, warships and barges that are ravaged by the elements until they are dismantled or salvaged.

Before the boats were dumped at the graveyard, the site was used as the slip for The Blazing Star Ferry, which transported passengers and cargo across the Arthur Kill to Woodbridge Township, New Jersey.  

The graveyard has been at the site since the 1930s, when Witt's Marine Equipment company worked to collect, salvage and re-sell materials from wrecked ships and the proud owner, John J. Witte, amassed hundreds of warships at the site. 

It is now overseen by New Jersey's Donjon Marine Company, which has put 12-ft metal walls around the perimeter in a bid to block it from prying eyes.

But while the graveyard remains a little-known secret even among New Yorkers, Donovan - the photographer - has been visiting the site for seven years.

Eerie: The shipyard can only been seen if visitors walk through a cemetery and ask for permission from private property owners to enter and reach the water

Ghostly: An image shows the Bayou Plaquemine, which was built in 1921 for the U.S. Army. The vessel and crew were assigned to the Fourth Service Command during World War II and based at Fort Barrancas, Florida before the vessel was eventually retired in 1972

Ancient: The colorful pipes and control panel of an oil barge can be seen at the graveyard, while in the background is a jail cell on board a New York Central barge

Rotting: The rusty vessels are hidden behind a 12ft fence near the water's edge but can be accessed by asking for permission from private homeowners nearby

Still: Donovan, a photograph from the UK, has taken photographs of the ship graveyard over the past seven years during his visits to New York City

He explained that the docks are only accessible by properties owned by families nearby, but that the homeowners allowed him to get a closer look once he asked for permission.

'The area is filled with exposed spikes aged by the elements, most of these boats have just rotted in the water,' he explained.

'The boats photographed were made out of materials taken from Mother Earth and used to serve a purpose. When they became obsolete, they were discarded and have slowly rotted and sank in the muck off Rossville as Mother Earth takes them back.'

The graveyard has been a final resting place for a ship that took part in D-Day and a World War II submarine destroyer that was the first ship manned by an all-black crew. Donovan's images also reveal a barge that contains a jail cell to ship prisoners.

Forgotten: The graveyard has been a final resting place for a ship that took part in D-Day and a submarine destroyer that was the first ship manned by an all-black crew

Out of order: Waters seep over a rusting barge as the tide rises at the ghostly ship graveyard, which is about 20 miles south of Manhattan and 18 miles from Brooklyn

Tipping point: In this image, the graveyard, which is located on Arthur Kill Road in Rossville, can be seen from an open train box car sitting on the deck of a barge

Resting place: Before the ships were dumped at the graveyard, the site was used as the slip for The Blazing Star Ferry, which transported passengers and cargo across the Arthur Kill to Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. It now harbors vessels until they are dismantled and parts are re-used

Among other vessels that have been left there to rust is a New York City Fire Department fireboat named in the honor of Abram S. Hewitt, who was elected mayor of the city in 1886.

The ship served from 1903 - the year he died - until 1958, when it was scrapped. During its lifetime, it helped rescue survivors when the General Slocum passenger boat sank in the East River in 1904.

'Most of the names have been taken off - spray painted over - but the New York City Fire Department fireboat Abram S. Hewitt is there,' Donovan explained. 'It has sunk in mud over the years and only the smoke stack is still visible.'
