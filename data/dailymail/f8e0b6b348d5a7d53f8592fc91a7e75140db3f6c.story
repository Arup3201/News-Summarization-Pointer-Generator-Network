It’s one of the fastest growing demands from travellers but many airlines are still not offering on-board wifi for their passengers, according to a study that identifies some of the cheapest rates.

Of those who are allowing fliers to stay connected, many are charging a hefty fee for each hour of use or for the duration of the entire trip.

Analysis by Cheapflights.co.uk revealed that Middle Eastern carriers Emirates and Etihad are charging the lowest tariffs at around £1.70 and £3.10 per hour, respectively.

Stay connected: Nearly half of 20 carriers included in a study are not offering on-board wifi

Of the 20 carriers included in the study, Turkish Airlines is the only one that does not charge a fee for wifi, while nine do not offer it at all.

Monarch Airlines charges £3.99 per person per flight.

On the pricier end of the scale, Aer Lingus, Air France and KLM charge approximately £8.65 for a single hour of in-flight wifi.

A recent survey of 1,073 adults in the UK found that 70 per cent of passengers want to remain connected to simply pass the time, stay in touch with family and friends or complete business work.

Planes have traditionally been a connectivity-free zone, but new rules from the European Aviation Safety Agency allow mobile devices to be left switched on during flights.

Before the rules were relaxed in September mobile devices on all flights had to be turned off or switched to flight mode before take-off.

The change clears the way for airlines to allow passengers to use their mobile phone plan to make calls and use data via satellite, but it appears carriers have been slow to implement it. 

Of the airlines included in the study, six are allowing travellers to use their phones (Aer Lingus, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic), and one (Lufthansa) is allowing text messages only.

Travellers should be careful before they start calling their friends on the ground or using their data, however, because they risk being hit with a massive bill. Prices depend on their provider’s international rates.

Cheapflights.co.uk travel expert Oonagh Shiel said: ‘With new guidelines and technological advances, if you’re a gadget obsessive it’s certainly worth checking out your options when it comes to using data and mobile services in-flight.

‘From our analysis, it seems that there are large discrepancies between airlines in terms of wifi costs on board, so if staying connected is important to you it’s worth factoring into the costs of your flight.

“Bear in mind that you’ll need to obey the individual airline rules on mobile use – and it’s worth researching mobile data costs with your operator before you go.

‘Alternatively, you could sit back and enjoy a well-earned holiday from checking your phone or tablet – and have a digital detox.’
