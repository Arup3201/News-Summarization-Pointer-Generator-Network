A woman whose seven-year-old son suffers from seizures has spoken out, saying his school district has been unwilling to help with finding a way for his service dog to come with him to school.

Mother Ericha Flateau, of Franklin, Massachusetts, told WCVB that service dog Paris is essential around-the-clock for her son Austin.

'Dogs can smell a chemical change when, um, a seizure starts,' she told the affiliate station.

Helping hand: Service dog Paris, seen next to 7-year-old Austin Flateau, can reportedly detect when the boy is about to have a seizure 

Condition: Austin Flateau lives with two brain malformations, which can also influence his speech

Austin Flateau lives with two brain malformations that can influence his speech, the affiliate station reported.

'His scariest symptom from that is seizure disorder,' Ericha Flateau said of her son's condition to WCVB.

Over $15,000 was raised to cover Paris' training by Austin's family  - which has said that his one-on-one aide has not been given permission by Franklin Public Schools to manage Paris, the news outlet reported.

'His school has said "Okay, she can come, but we're not going to have any responsibilities for her,'" Ericha Flateau also told WCVB.

Because of this, she told the affiliate station her two options include stopping working and stepping in as Austin's dog handler or paying for a dog handler.

Ericha Flateau has said she might have to relocate if a plan regarding the use of the service dog with the school district isn't possible

Resistance: Austin's mother Ericha Flateau (seen with her son and Paris) says the local school district has said it will not be responsible for the dog 

Franklin Public Schools has said it 'fully provides and promotes access for all individuals with disabilities, including those that require that assistance of service animals'

The Franklin School District directed the affiliate station to a law which says 'A public entity is not responsible for the care or supervision of a service animal.'

Flateau told WCVB she might have to relocate if a plan regarding the use of the service dog with the school district isn't possible. 

In a Sunday 'Fox and Friends' appearance, she said 'So for a couple of weeks [Austin] was out of school because we were actually in Ohio training with his dog Paris, but he has not returned to school since we have been home, and the reason for that is because she provides a medical seizure alert. So they essentially need to be at each other's hips 24/7.

'Um, I cannot afford to hire a third-party dog handler, um, and I also can’t afford not to go to work myself,” she said. 'So [Paris] has been home with him since we returned home from training.'

The school district, meanwhile, said it 'fully provides and promotes access for all individuals with disabilities, including those that require that assistance of service animals' in a statement sent to the television program.
