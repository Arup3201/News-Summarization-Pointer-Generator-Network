Photographer Cinnamon Heathcote Drury, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court, was cleared of racially aggravated assault

A portrait photographer to the stars wept yesterday as she was cleared of pushing over a pregnant woman and calling her a terrorist in a supermarket row.

Cinnamon Heathcote-Drury had also been accused of calling the family of the hijab-wearing woman suicide bombers, and telling her: 'I'm a British citizen. I don't know where you came from.'

But a jury took only 15 minutes to acquit her of racially aggravated assault after hearing that the police investigation was a 'shambles'.

And the prosecution accepted during the hearing that she was a 'wonderful person' who was 'eloquent and well-spoken' and not a racist.

Isleworth Crown Court heard she had offered to help mother-of-three Mounia Hamoumi, who was six months' pregnant at the time, unload her shopping trolley after her husband refused to help because he was too busy looking after their children.

The confrontation began after her husband told Miss Heathcote-Drury to 'get lost' as they queued for the till at Tesco in Kensington, West London, in November.

Prosecutor Nermine Abdel Sayed said Miss Heathcote-Drury became 'aggressive', adding: 'You used the words “suicide bomber” and “terrorist”.'

Miss Heathcote-Drury was also accused of saying: 'You're probably claiming jobseeker's [allowance]', and of pushing Mrs Hamoumi to the floor.

Miss Heathcote-Drury denied pushing Mrs Hamoumi and using any racist language, saying that the comments attributed to her had been 'made up' and that she had been the victim of an assault.

She said she was told by the husband 'You **** off', before being tripped up by Mrs Hamoumi as she tried to walk away.

She also claimed Mrs Hamoumi kicked her in both shins, punched her and slammed her arm on a supermarket trolley.

But police declined to pursue Miss Heathcote-Drury's allegations of assault and charged her.

Her defence barrister told the court 
that the police investigation was a 'shambles' with no evidence of 
injuries on the alleged victim and no independent witnesses who saw the 
alleged shove.

The jury also heard that Miss Heathcote-Drury had repeatedly requested CCTV footage of the fracas from the store and the police.

But she was told by police five months after the incident that the footage did not show anything of significance for the case.

Outside court Miss Heathcote-Drury's 
solicitor, Sarnjit Lal, said: 'Miss Heathcote-Drury is relieved that her
 horrendous ordeal is over and delighted that the jury, having heard the
 evidence, took only 15 minutes to acquit her, which reflects the 
baseless nature of these allegations.'

Miss Heathcote-Drury has 11 portraits 
in the National Portrait Gallery of subjects including London Mayor 
Boris Johnson and BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman.

Speaking yesterday, she 
said: 'It has been extremely tough to have this hanging over me for the 
past eight months. Naturally I am immensely relieved it is finally 
over.'
