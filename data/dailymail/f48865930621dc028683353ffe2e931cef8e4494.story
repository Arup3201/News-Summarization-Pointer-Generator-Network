Rising 2,400 feet above sea level, like Myanmar's own miniature Mount Fuji, Mount Popa, a volcano in the centre of the country is home to a hidden monastery.

At its summit, Taung Kalat is a beautiful Buddhist haven, home to monkeys, statuesque, golden Buddhas, and according to legend, a group of long-suffering spirits.

An active place of worship, Burmese pilgrims visit each year, especially during the full moon festival seasons of Nayon and Nadaw, in May and November respectively.

During December and in April, locals hike from the foot of Mount Popa to its summit, to take part in the Thingyan festival.

The incredible spot is also a known gathering place for Burmese spirits known as Nats.

The 37 Great Nats were aristocrats who died in painful circumstances such as leprosy, beheadings and snake bites.

Having endured such hardships, it is thought they deserve to be worshipped after death, so pilgrims make the mammoth journey up 777 winding steps to leave offerings to them from money to bottles of whiskey. 

The magical mountain is steeped in myth and legend, and is known by some as Myanmar's Mount Olympus.
