An embarrassing Facebook photo inspired a young woman to ditch unhealthy habits and lose almost half her body weight.

At 20st 5lb and wearing size 20 clothes, Nicola McKay, 22, struggled to enjoy walks with her friends and suffered constant headaches.

But a photograph taken of her at a family birthday party provided her with the motivation needed to improve her lifestyle for good.

Today Miss McKay, a restaurant worker from Greenock, weighs 11st and wears size 10 outfits.

Before and after: Nicola McKay lost almost half of her bodyweight after being mortified by a photo of herself on Facebook (L)

She said: 'After my cousin’s birthday party I was sat at home, looking at pictures people had taken of the day. Someone had tagged me in a picture and put it on Facebook.

'Usually, I couldn’t bear to look at photographs of myself for more than a few seconds before turning away, but this one really shocked me. I looked really unhealthy. It was horrible.

'I thought, "I’m disgusting". I couldn’t believe I’d been in such a state of denial that I hadn’t done anything earlier to lose weight. I decided to destroy my bad health habits before they destroyed me.'

She said her weight gain stemmed from her habit of eating at irregular times and her inability to control her portions. 'I was greedy - I couldn’t stop eating. I ate lots of comfort food, like takeaway Chinese and pizzas. I was full, but I kept on eating.

Motivated: Miss McKay has managed to lose 9st 5lb by sticking to regular mealtimes and joining a gym

Shocked: Nicola described herself as 'disgusting' and decided to join a slimming club. She has since lost over 9 stone

'I wouldn’t eat regular meals - I just ate when I felt like eating. I ate large portions, but never the right food. As a result, I was overeating without even realising. I would snack on crisps and chocolates and sugary drinks through the day.'

By the time she saw the fateful photograph in April 2011, a nurse had already advised Miss McKay to lose weight.

Miss McKay said: 'My BMI was more than 50. I was told being overweight was the cause of my heartburn, headaches and mood swings.

Lifestyle overhaul: Nicola would eat large portions, but never the right food and would snack on crisps and chocolates and sugary drinks through the day. She now follows a healthy diet regime and loves working out

Fashion first: Nicola used to follow her friends' lead and wear tiny skirts but has now found shapes to flatter her

'I didn’t want to feel pressured into weight loss - it was a decision I had to make myself. Like most people I use Facebook quite a lot and the thought of people having the same reaction to my photo as I did was quite upsetting.

'So, one night I made up my mind that I would go to slimming club and if I enjoyed it, I would stick with it, and everything changed from that point.'

After her first week at a slimming club, in October 2011, she was delighted to discover she had lost 7lb. She joined a gym not long afterwards and discovered she enjoyed taking regular exercise.

She said: 'I never thought I would go on a treadmill. I walked at first, but eventually built up the courage to start running. When I realised what I was doing, I was amazed. I never thought I would find myself running at a gym.

'I’ve always loved spending time with my friends and going out dancing. Even when I was large I was an outgoing and bubbly person. So I decided to use Zumba classes and dancing video games at home to help me keep the weight off.'

Health problems: Her BMI was more than 50 and she was told being overweight was the cause of her heartburn, headaches and mood swings

Miss McKay has managed to lose 9st 5lb by sticking to regular mealtimes.

Before losing the weight, she never ate breakfast and opted for fatty takeaways at unpredictable times.

Today, she eats cereal and banana for breakfast, followed by a typical lunch of toast and poached eggs and calorie-controlled lasagna or baked potato with tuna and salad for her evening meal. She usually drinks water, snacks on grain bars or enjoys soup if she feels particularly peckish.

She said her new slim figure has allowed her to find new outfits to wear. 'When pictures of me are posted on Facebook now, people are usually very encouraging about the way I look.

'When I was bigger, I thought nothing of wearing very short skirts because that’s what my friends were doing. But I look back at those pictures now and think, "why did everyone let me go out with a dress that was halfway up my bum?"

As she was: Miss McKay never ate breakfast and gorged on fatty takeaways at unpredictable times but that has all changed now

'But now, when I go out, my whole dress sense has changed. I love fashion and feel I look a lot more sophisticated - I like high-waisted pencil skirts and elegant tops. I feel more classy, more ladylike, when I’m out with girls, which is a wonderful feeling.'

She says the secret to her amazing turnaround was that she waited until she felt ready to make a lasting change.

She argued that despite the benefits that weight loss can bring, young people should not feel under social or peer pressure to change the way they look.

She said: 'Even if you’re overweight, or too skinny, or short or tall, you’re still beautiful inside. That person inside you isn’t going to change - I didn’t.

'If you’re thinking of losing weight - don’t do it until you’re ready. I hate the idea of people being bullied because of their weight. It breaks my heart when I read about people suffering or even committing suicide because they’re worried about their size.

'If you’re being called names, be the stronger person, and have the strength to say to yourself, "no, I’m in charge of myself, and I’ll lose weight if and when I’m ready’.'
