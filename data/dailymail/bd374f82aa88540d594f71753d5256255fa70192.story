The musician whose vintage Gibson guitar was severely damaged on a flight last month has finally received some good news about his prized axe.

Not only is Gibson going to repair Dave Schneider’s original 1965 ES-335, which is worth an estimated $10,000 – they offered to give him a new one. Delta, too, eventually offered to pay for the guitar and gave him two free flight vouchers.

Mr Schneider is a guitarist and singer for the hockey-themed rock band The Zambonis, as well as a Hanukah-themed rock band, The LeeVees.

Anger: The musician posted with the picture this explanation: 'It got jammed in an ELEVATOR! That is a steel rail bending from a semi-hollow body being slammed/jammed in it'

Mr Schneider lamented on his Facebook page on December 26 that he was forced to check his 1965 Gibson ES-335 for his flight from Buffalo, New York to Detroit.

He arrived at the Detroit airport 
baggage claim only to find his axe wedged in its carrying case between a
service elevator and a loading dock rail.

Mr Schneider said he was given a hard time by the airline, who had initially only offered him $1,000 to repair his guitar. Repeated calls and emails to the company were not returned, he said.

Seeing his struggle, Gibson contacted Mr Schneider and offered him another ES-335 free of charge.

‘At this moment, the Gibson company is rocking even harder than Pete Townshend’s Les Paul,’ he wrote in an email to Yahoo News.

The happy guitarist says that he plans to pay it forward by purchasing a few new Gibsons and then donate them to charity.

He added that Gibson reaching out to him was ‘the cherry on top of the best musical nightmare ever.’

After the initial December flight, the musician posted two pictures of his ruined guitar to Facebook, saying it was a ‘musician’s worst nightmare (come) true.’

Speaking with Yahoo News, Mr Schneider said that he wasn’t even supposed to fly out from Buffalo.

His flight from Portland, Maine had been diverted to Rochester, where he and band mate Adam Gardner had performed songs from their self-described 'indie-pop rock' album, 'Hanukkah Rocks.'

They were en route another gig in St. Petersburg, Florida when the incident happened. The musician was able to carry his Gibson with him on the first leg of the flight.

The duo drove down to Buffalo, where the Delta staffers said he could not carry on his guitar. ‘I’ve always carried it on,’ Mr Schneider said, adding that he had never had an issue with carrying on his instrument before.

The guitarist said that in a last ditch effort, he showed the Delta staffers an article from early 2012 about new Federal Aviation Administration laws that allowed for instruments that could be safely stowed onboard – either in overhead storage or under a seat – as carry-on luggage.

The FAA law also allows musicians to buy an extra seat for bulkier instruments.

However, that failed to work, as did gate check, and Mr Schneider was forced to check his instrument.In Detroit, he took out his smartphone to film his guitar’s return. Sure enough, its carrying case had somehow gotten wedged between the service elevator and the loading dock. 

He took to Facebook to vent his anger, writing: ‘Delta Airlines, next time I beg you not to make me check my 1965 Gibson ES335, please do so. You had the space, darn darn darn. 

‘BTW It got jammed in an ELEVATOR! That is a steel rail bending from a semi-hollow body being slammed/jammed in it.’

Mr Schneider said that while he was offered a $1,000 check from the airline, the estimated damage was nearly twice that, at $1,980.

He told Yahoo that he’s just looking for the proper compensation. ‘I’m not greedy,’ he said.

‘This is not representative of the great care we take with our customer’s property and make it right with him,’ a spokesperson told MailOnline. ‘We’ll work with him to make it all right.’

The spokesperson went on to stress that this one circumstance was not exemplary. ‘I can tell you that we transport hundreds of thousands of items for customers, and the large majority of things are transported safely,’ the spokesperson said.

In 2009, Canadian country-Western singer Dave Carroll became an internet sensation after he wrote a song about how his acoustic guitar was badly damaged by handlers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport.

His song, ‘United Breaks Guitars,’ has garnered 12.7million hits on YouTube since 2009. The woeful ballad chronicles his poor experience with United Airlines as he tries to get them to cover the damage to his instrument.
