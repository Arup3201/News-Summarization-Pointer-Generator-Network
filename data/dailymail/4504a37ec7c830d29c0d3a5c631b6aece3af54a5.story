It’s a stunning former hunting lodge in its own right - but also gives you the chance to make friends with some rather regal neighbours.

The ’Hansel and Gretel’ cottage in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, sits centrally within its own 123 acres and is on the market for £850,000.

And it is located next to Princess Anne's 730-acre Gatcombe Park estate, where Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall moved in January 2013.

The Princess Royal's house on the Gatcombe Park estate stables Zara's horses and is where she trains both racehorses and her three-day eventers.

The house and farming estate were bought by the Queen in 1976 for her daughter and the husband Captain Mark Phillips.

Now Anne lives in the large manor house with her second husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, while Mark is in the adjoining Aston Farm with his second wife.

Zara and Tindall moved onto the estate last year, after selling their £1.2million white stucco marital home 20 miles away in Cheltenham.

Despite buying their home shortly after their wedding, in July 2011, Zara had always kept the home she previously lived in on her mother's estate.

And moving back made the estate even more of a family affair - with Zara's brother Peter, his wife Autumn and their two daughters, also living there.

Zara - who is 15th in line to the throne - and Tindall had their first child, Mia, on January 17. She is 16th in the line of succession.

The estate agent for the property - available for 'offers in excess of £850,000' - is Hamptons International.
