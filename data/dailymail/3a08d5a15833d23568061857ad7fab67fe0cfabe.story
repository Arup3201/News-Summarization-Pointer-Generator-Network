A shimmering gold suit that has been owned by both Elvis Presley and Elton John has emerged for £17,900 ($29,990).

The eye-catching outfit was created by famous clothing designer Nudie Cohn for the King himself in the 1950s.

The shiny suit, which is embellished with silver rhinestones, would have cost around £3,000 ($5,026) to make.

Elvis had more than one of the flashy costumes made and he is pictured on the front of his '50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong' album wearing a similar version.

It is thought that he wore the suit for a performance in Maryland, USA, on June 27, 1976.

Experts believe that Elton John met Elvis backstage after the show and that after expressing his admiration for the sparkling outfit, Elvis gave it to him.

Elton was then pictured wearing the suit at a concert in 1984 while on his Breaking Hearts tour.

He sold the costume, which has been embroidered with a tag reading 'Elvis Presley', to a private collector who has now put it up for sale through Julien's Auctions in New York.

Darren Julien, from Julien's Auctions, said: 'We believe that Elvis gave the suit directly to Elton after a show on 27 June 1976.

'It was probably something Elton admired so Elvis gave it to him, which is what he was like.

'Elvis probably wore it and I assume he did on the night of that performance although we don't have any verification or photos to prove that.

'He is pictured on the cover of the 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong album but our researchers have looked into it and we think it is a different suit.

'From the pictures we have it seems that Elton wore it at a concert in the 80s.

'This is one of those things that are quite funny because a lot of celebrities collect things belonging to other celebrities.

'It's rare we would fine something worn by Elvis and belonging to Elton as well, so it will be interesting to see whose the most collectible out of the two of them.

'Not only that, but Nudies, who made the suit, are very collectible so we have the tri-factor for collectibility.

'Elton sold it to a private collector who has now put it up for auction.'

The auction is on May 17.
