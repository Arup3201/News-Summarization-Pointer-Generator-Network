Bournemouth have curbed their spending this summer, but manager Eddie Howe is safe in the knowledge that the club’s board will back him to the hilt should he want to splash the cash.

The Cherries, who travel to Huddersfield on Saturday, surprised many by finishing 10th in the Championship last season after spending £2.5million on South African striker Tokelo Rantie among others.

And while that initial financial outlay has subsided somewhat — a decision the manager insists was made by himself rather than those above — they are confident of mixing it around the play-offs.

‘We’ve got a stronger squad and we’re in a better place this time than last year,’ he said.

Howe did lose top scorer Lewis Grabban to Norwich City for £3m this summer, but wisely reinvested some of that fee on striker Callum Wilson from Coventry.

Signing the 22-year-old typifies his management in that Bournemouth are a club who look to nurture.

‘We believe we have a very strong squad at a good age,’ Howe added. ‘It’s difficult to find better players than we have with the budget constraints we’re under. If you can’t find an improvement, why bother bringing anyone in? You’re better developing the players rather than bringing new people in. That’s always been my methodology.’

It’s certainly astute given that Bournemouth have twice collapsed into insolvency — in 1997 and 2008 —before owner Maxim Demin overhauled the club and funded a tilt at only their second ever spell at Championship level.

Howe puts the rise down to strong communication between boss and board, intimating that it is now time to kick on further.

Asked if money would be made available in January should the club be in a position to reach the top six, Howe said: ‘When the time comes that we feel we need to go to them then I’m sure they’ll back us.

‘They’ve never turned me down through a disagreement on a recruitment purchase.’
