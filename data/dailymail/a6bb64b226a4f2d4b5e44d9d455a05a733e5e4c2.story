Newly elected president of Iran Hasan Rowhani called for 'rationality and moderation' after he won more than 50 per cent of the vote.

Thousands of supporters danced in the streets after Interior Minister Mostafa Mohammad confirmed his victory earlier this evening.

Rowhani was the lone moderate candidate in the race and supported by reformists in a race that once appeared solidly in the hands of Tehran's Islamic establishment.

In his first statement after the results were announced, Rowhani said that 'a new opportunity has been created ... for those who truly respect democracy, interaction and free dialogue.'

He added: 'I've never been an extremist.'I support moderation. I thank God that once again rationality and moderation has shined on Iran.'Â 

'This is the victory of wisdom, a victory of moderation and a victory of commitment over extremism.'

Thousands of young Iranians chanted 'Long live Rowhani' after they heard of his victory. The moderate had not been expected to win the election until late in the day

The vote brings an end to the 
eight-year era of the combative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose 
2009 re-election was steeped in controversy.

Candidates
seen as hard-line loyalists included current nuclear negotiator Saeed 
Jalili and Khamenei adviser Ali Akbar Velayati.

Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, 
another conservative candidate who had been running far behind in second
place, conceded defeat.

Rowhani has controversially vowed to follow a policy of detente and interaction with the outside world.

A victory by former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rowhani is seen as a setback for Iran's Islamic establishment.

The British Foreign Office said in a 
statement that it hoped Mr Rowhani would use his victory to engage with 
international concerns over Iran's nuclear programme and develop a 
"constructive" relationship with the wider international community.

"We note the announcement that Hassan Rouhani has won the Iranian presidential elections," the statement said.

'We call on him to use the 
opportunity to set Iran on a different course for the future: addressing
international concerns about Iran's nuclear programme, taking forward a
constructive relationship with the international community, and 
improving the political and human rights situation for the people of 
Iran.'

Election officials began the ballot 
count after voters waited in line for hours yesterday at some polling 
stations in downtown Tehran and other cities. 72 percent of the 50 million eligible Iranians had turned out to vote.

Voting was extended by five hours to meet demand, but also as possible political stagecraft to showcase the participation.

The
strong turn out suggested liberals and others abandoned a planned 
boycott as the election was transformed into a showdown across the 
Islamic Republic's political divide.

On one side were hard-liners looking 
to cement their control behind candidates such as Jalili, who says he is
'100 percent' against detente with Iran's foes, or Qalibaf, who was 
boosted by a reputation as a steady hand for Iran's sanctions-wracked 
economy.

Opposing them were reformists and 
others rallying behind the 'purple wave' campaign of Rowhani, the lone 
relative moderate left in the race.

Many
reform-minded Iranians who have faced years of crackdowns looked to 
Rowhani's rising fortunes as a chance to claw back a bit of ground.

Iran
has no credible political polling to serve as harder metrics for the 
street buzz around candidates, who need more than 50 percent of the vote
to seal victory and avoid a runoff.

Journalists face limits on
reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country. 
Iran does not allow outside election observers.

Yesterday Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the 
Supreme Leader of Iran, furiously told Washington 'the hell with you' 
following U.S. criticism over the openness of the presidential contest.

The Ayatollah issued the stinging 
rebuke after casting his ballot in a race that was criticised as being 
rigged in favour of Tehran's ruling system.

The U.S. has issued repeated 
criticism of Iran's clampdowns on the opposition and the rejection of 
moderate voices from the ballot.

'Recently I have heard that a U.S. 
security official has said they do not accept this election,' Khamenei 
was quoted by state TV after casting his vote. 'OK, the hell with you.'

U.S State Department spokesman Jen 
Psaki said that while the U.S. does not think the Iranian election 
process is transparent, it is not discouraging the Iranian people from 
voting.

'We certainly encourage them to,' Psaki said. 'But certainly the history here and what happened just four years ago gives all of us pause.'

Irregularities in the vote count of the 2009 election were Ahmadinejad won led to millions of Iranians protesting the results.

The Supreme Leader did publicly endorse a successor for Ahmadinejad, who had a spectacular falling out with the theocracy over his attempts to challenge Khamenei's near-absolute powers.

The Ayatollah did not reveal who he was voting for when he cast his ballot today.
