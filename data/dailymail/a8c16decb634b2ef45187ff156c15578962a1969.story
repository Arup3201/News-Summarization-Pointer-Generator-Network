Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell has revealed that her sister Pumpkin believes Mama June's child molester boyfriend is her father.

Anna, who accused Mark McDaniel of repeatedly sexually assaulting her when she was eight, told Dr Drew  that her younger sister believes the convicted molester is her dad.

She said that is why Pumpkin, whose real name is Lauryn Thompson, has defended her mother since reports emerged that she was dating McDaniel again after his release from prison in March.

'He was supposed to be [Pumpkin's] so-called father or whatever it is,' she told Dr Drew on HLN.

Speaking out: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell spoke to Dr Drew and said that her younger sister believes her father in Mark McDaniel - whom Anna says molested her when she was just eight years old

'You know, out of all the kids we have, Mama does not know who Pumpkin's dad is. And Pumpkin thinks it's Mark which kind of hurts my feelings, because Mama is making her believe that someone who did that to me is her father.

'Now Pumpkin hates me for it... I don't really care. Me and Pumpkin have never been that close... Now with her cussing me out, [saying ] "screw you" "F you"... I'm just done with it.'

She added that McDaniel, 53, may have originally come back into Mama June's life earlier this year because he wanted to 'surprise' Pumpkin after he got out of prison.

He served 10 years after pleading guilty to child molestation following Anna's claims that he had sexually assaulted her - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was in bed beside her.

After Anna told her teacher and police about the assaults, her mother refused to believe her, she said.

Denial: Honey Boo Boo and her mother Mama June are seen outside their home last month

'Mama didn't believe me for a while,' she told HLN. She would say, '"Why would you do that to me?" And I would say, "Mama, he did it, I can't take the past back".

'He's apologized for what he's done but she won't... I'm hurt now and I was hurt then.'

But she added that she is still in touch with her mother and that they are 'working on things'.

Pumpkin, now 14, has repeatedly defended her mother in interviews and on social media, while Mama June herself has insisted that she hasn't seen the man in 10 years.

But photographs appear to tell a different story.

She has been pictured house hunting with McDaniel, while another image shows them together with Honey Boo Boo. In that image, McDaniel has his hand on the nine-year-old girl's shoulder. 

Together: Images, such as this one, have emerged showing Mama June with McDaniel. In this photograph, they are pictured with Mama June's daughter, nine-year-old Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson

The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September.

'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer. 'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.' 

Since the reports emerged, the family's show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, has been canceled.

Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell.
