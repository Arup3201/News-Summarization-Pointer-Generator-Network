More than a dozen Eton pupils have made the journey from the prestigious public school all the way to Downing Street.

David Cameron became the 19th Old Etonian to be elected Prime Minister in 2010, and many of his close political allies also walked the corridors of the renowned Berkshire college as boys.

Now an exam paper has revealed how current pupils are being taught to assume they will follow that same well-trodden path - by drafting speeches they would deliver to the nation as its leader.

Born to rule: A question on the Eton College King's Scholarship exam paper asks pupils to 'imagine you are the prime minister'

A question on a paper sat by 12-year-old pupils in 2011 gives a telling glimpse into how Eton fosters ambition in its students from an early age, by asking them to imagine they are running the country.

It appeared on the 2011 King's Scholarship Examination paper, which can be viewed on the school's website, and asked students to consider whether 'it is better to be loved than feared'.

It reads: 'The year is 2040. There 
have been riots in the streets of London after Britain has run out of 
petrol because of an oil crisis in the Middle East.'

Students are asked to imagine that protesters have attacked public buildings, and that policemen have been killed.

'Consequently, the Government has 
deployed the Army to curb the protests... 25 protesters have been killed
by the Army,' it goes on.

'You are the Prime Minister,' the 
paper says, before instructing the young Etonians to draft the script 
for a speech to be broadcast to the nation explaining why deploying the 
Army was 'both necessary and moral'.

Along with David Cameron, London 
Mayor Boris Johnson also attended Eton, as did his brother Jo Johnson - 
who last month was appointed head of Mr Cameron's new policy unit.

MPs Oliver Letwin, Nick Hurd and Jesse Norman - newly appointed to the prime minister's policy advisory board - and Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn are all old Etonians, as are chief whip Sir George Young and Foreign Minister Hugo Swire.

Each year the brightest minds at Eton are given the opportunity to sit the King's Scholarship examination and become a King's Scholar.

There are normally 70 in the school - distinguished by their black gowns. Each boy is given their own study-bedroom within their boarding house, College, which consists solely of King's Scholars.
