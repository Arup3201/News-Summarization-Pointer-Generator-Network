Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has 'categorically' ruled out a move for AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli.

Rodgers was linked with the former Manchester City star after he spoke about Balotelli in the build-up to Liverpool's game against Milan on Saturday.

Liverpool are in the market for a striker after Loic Remy's move to Anfield collapsed, but Rodgers dismissed any possibility of signing Balotelli.

Speaking ahead of the International Champions Cup final against old rivals Manchester United here on Monday, he said: 'I can categorically tell you that he will not be at Liverpool.

'I was asked the question about Balotelli and spoke about what a talent he is and excellent player he is.

'He is a wonderful player, but an AC Milan player, I just gave my opinion of him, but doesn’t mean I will be signing him.' 

Rodgers backed United to emerge as a Premier League force again this season with new boss Louis van Gaal at the helm after finishing seventh under David Moyes.

He predicted a competitive game between the two clubs in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium but insisted that it will have little bearing on this season’s title race. 

Speculation: Rodgers waxed lyrical about Balotelli's ability recently, fueling transfer talk

‘I have watched Louis van Gaal for many years and he is a very good manager,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘It was unfortunate what happened to David Moyes, but I saw Holland at the World Cup and they did very well.

‘He will look forward to the challenge, but it will be different to any other league he has been involved in.

‘United have shown over the last 20 -odd years that they have been a threat and I’m sure that will be the case this year. I only think of Liverpool, but I would suspect they would expect to be challengers again.

‘It’s a big rivalry and won’t have any bearing on how the season pans out, but we have come all this way and I’m sure we all want to finish it off with a really good game. All the games out here have been competitive and this will be no different.’
