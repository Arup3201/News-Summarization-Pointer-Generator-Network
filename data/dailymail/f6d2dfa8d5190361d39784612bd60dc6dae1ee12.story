Georgia is a 16-year-old with a lousy attitude; she swears at the teachers, won’t wear her school uniform and storms out of class when she’s told off.

But the platinum blonde is also the first of her family to almost reach the end of her school life without being expelled, and her teachers at the Thornhill Community Academy are proud that she’ll end up sitting her GCSEs. 

Georgia is one of the 'stars' of Educating Yorkshire. By turns horrifying and heartwarming, this reality TV show makes fascinating viewing even if it is, at times, a little uncomfortable.

Tough job: Headteacher Johnny Mitchell stars in Educating Yorkshire along with some of his charges

Filmed over eight weeks, it shows the inner workings of the comprehensive in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, from teachers’ meetings to the school prom. Each story is compelling, from the young Asian girl cramming for her GCSEs, to the bullied boy who can’t stop lashing out with his fists.

At the heart of it all is no-nonsense head teacher Jonny Mitchell, who has a penchant for singing to himself. He’s been at Thornhill for just under two years and he’s determined to give his pupils a decent education and teach them how to be model citizens; even if it’s the last thing they want. 

The show is made by the same people who made 2011’s hit show Educating Essex. 'There are universal themes in both shows, but I think you get a real flavour of Yorkshire in our show,' says Jonny.

'Dewsbury, to most people, has negative connotations but we wanted to do something to make our young children proud. We’re trying very hard to make their lives better under difficult circumstances.'

Dewsbury has a 20 per cent unemployment rate and Jonny estimates that  10 per cent of his pupils’ parents are white collar workers; the rest are blue collar and unemployed. Half his students are of Asian, mainly Pakistani, origin while the rest are white British.

TV star: But Mr Mitchell said they quickly forgot about the cameras

A former failing school which is now rated ‘good’ by Ofsted, Thornhill was forecast to get 45 per cent A-C grades at GCSE last year; it actually managed 63 per cent.

'I think we’re doing a fantastic job and I wanted to put that across,' says Jonny of his reasons for agreeing to 65 cameras being placed in almost every corner of his school. 'I think our kids are brilliant and they deserve to experience something a little bit different.'

Jonny says staff and pupils were only really aware of the cameras for the first few days. 'In the first 20 minutes the kids were acting up but we told them you won’t be a TV star if you make all these obscene gestures and they stopped.

'The prom thing is ridiculous, it's 
quite obscene. A lot of our families are financially 
deprived but they all want to keep up with each other'

'For the first two days it felt weird, but quite exciting. Everyone was coming in with new hairdos. But then it was business as usual although, generally, behaviour improved a bit. It’s still better than it was; I think that’s because they know the show’s coming out and they don’t want to let the side down.'

The programme certainly shows the ups and downs of teaching. There are huge challenges, from the children whose behaviour constantly disrupts classes to the boy with a stutter who’s terrified about how he’ll cope with his oral examinations.

There are also moments of farce and pathos, such as when Jonny has to tell a boy’s shocked mother that he hasn’t behaved well enough to go to the school prom. She’d already taken out a loan and shelled out £1,500 to hire a sports car and £2,000 on a suit for her son.

'The prom thing is ridiculous, it’s quite obscene,' says Jonny. 'A lot of our families are financially deprived but they all want to keep up with each other. They spend shedloads on a dress their daughters will never wear again. It’s bonkers.'

In this media savvy world, the children and staff are going to become ‘stars’ in their own right – with all the potential online bullying that comes with it.

Jonny says the children have been well prepared. 'We’ll have a lot of support from the production company and Channel 4, who have given us a list of people the children can talk to individually. Lots of the kids have been briefed beforehand and told what the impact might be. There’s a huge support network.'

Reality bites: The show reveals the inner workings of a comprehensive in Dewsbury

Over 100 schools volunteered to be featured, and it took ten months for Thornhill to be chosen and for its staff, pupils and parents to get to know the producers and be fully on board.

'I know some people would call it a leap of faith, but I got to know the producers pretty well during that time. I think it speaks volumes about their professionalism that I was willing to stake my reputation and that of my colleagues on two people I’ve only known for a few months.'

Although consent forms had to be signed at every stage of the process, the school had no editorial control and sometimes the teachers as well as the pupils are seen making mistakes. 'It shows humanity,' says Jonny. 'Yes it shows error, but it also shows people working hard. I don’t think any of us come out of it at all badly.'

Jonny, who looks like a nightclub bouncer but actually began his working life as an accountant, is hoping the show will attract more pupils as the school’s not quite fully subscribed.

'I want to pull in nearby kids, and we can only do that by improving and being successful. This show will add kudos for us. I hope it works.'
