A Texas woman faces charges of endangering a child after she left her two-year-old granddaughter alone in a car for over an hour to go grocery shopping.

Deborah Reece, 60, of Burleson, Texas, was arrested yesterday as she left a Walmart in Crowley, Texas, this after two women heard the toddler's screams as she sat alone in a car, belted into a safety seat.

The women removed the child, who was sweating profusely, and alerted a nearby officer to the situation.

According to CBS 11, the child had been inside the car with the windows rolled up and the engine off for over an hour, on a day when temperatures in the area reached almost 100 degrees. 

Reece claims that the child had fallen asleep and she simply forgot about her.

The officer called an ambulance immediately, and Reece was picked up as she returned to her car armed with bags of groceries. 

The girl was treated on the scene for heat exposure, and then taken to Cooks Children’s Hospital for further examination.
