These two female arm wrestlers were all smiles as they prepared to do battle in a charity bout.

But their laughter soon turned to horror when wrestler 'Sweet Treats' inadvertently snapped her opponent's arm as they strained to overpower one another at the event in Delaware.

Stomach-churning video footage of the match shows the injured arm wrestler, nicknamed 'Rogue Scout', looking stunned as she and her horrified rival realise what has happened.

All smiles: Rogue Scout, left, and Sweet Treats, right, prepare to do battle at the charity arm wrestling event

Shock: Stunned Rogue Scout clutches her arm as she realises her bone has snapped, while her opponent looks on in horror

The video clip shows Ms Weber, a 31-year-old physical therapist from Lewes, Delaware, win the first round of her match against Sweet Treats at the event in Rehoboth Beach.

Victorious Rogue Scout, a member of the Southern Delaware Roller Girls, is shown raising her arms in delight before blowing a kiss at her rival.

But when the wrestlers face off for a second time - this time using their left arms - Sweet Treats not only prevails, but also breaks her opponent's limb in the process.

Snap: Rogue Scout's humerus bone snapped just above the elbow as Sweet Treat forced her arm to the table

The footage, posted online by the Delaware News Journal, shows the pair straining in a deadlock for a number of seconds, before Ms Weber's arm suddenly snaps backwards just above the elbow.

A visibly shaken Rogue Scout can be seen clutching her arm and gaping in shock, as rival Sweet Treats covers her mouth with her hands in horror.

The 31-year-old is understood to have broken her humerus, the bone that runs from the shoulder to the elbow, in the incident.

'Stuff like that, you never expect things like that to happen,' Ms Weber told the Delaware News Journal.

'I was looking forward to a fun thing to do for a good cause. It's nobody's fault, it's just a freak thing that happened.'

While Ms Weber took a philosophical view of the incident, she admitted the experience marked the end of her short-lived arm wrestling career.

'I think one time was enough for me,' said the physical therapist, who added that she would continue to support the Delaware Arm Wrestling Lady League in future - but only from the sidelines.

Despite the unfortunate mishap, the charity event raised over $1,000 for breast cancer research.
