A passenger who died in a fall aboard a Carnival cruise ship at a Miami dock has been identified as a 20-year-old college student from South Carolina.

Kendall Wernet, of Moncks Corner, fell to his death from a mast Monday aboard the Carnival Ecstasy ship.

The vessel was docked at Miami's port when Wernet apparently climbed its forward mast in a restricted area and plummeted to the deck below.

Police said the Clemson University junior fell a distance equal to two decks on the ship. Wernet was pronounced dead at a hospital just before 8.30am from blunt force trauma to the head.

There is no evidence of foul play, according to detectives, and all signs point to the death as an accident.

Clemson University Dean of Students Shannon Finning released a statement to the press expressing condolences to Wernet's family and friends, as did Carnival Cruise lines. 

Wernet, a management major, went on the three-day cruise to the Bahamas as part of an awards weekend for top performers at the organization Student Painters - a group dedicated to teaching young people how to run small businesses.

Steve Acorn, director of Student Painters, told Fox Carolina that Wernet has been part of the organization for three years, working as a regional manager and executive.

'Everyone that he came around and that he touched really respected him and was just happy that they were working with Kendall because of his great skills, and ability and compassion,' said Acorn.

Describing the 20-year-old man as mature and compassionate, Acorn insisted that Wernet was not drinking or doing drugs at the time of the accident.

The Clemson junior and four of his friends apparently decided to climb the mast to watch the sunrise over Miami, according to Acorn.

The men ascended to the platform about 20 feet in the air shortly before 5am and were hanging out, talking about their goals for the future, when a radar dish on the ship swung around and struck Wernet, knocking him off the mast.

Wernet was treated by medics aboard the cruise ship until it docked. The unconscious man was then rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Chase Lawson, a fellow Clemson student who was also aboard the ship, described Wernet as someone who has touched many lives.

'We lost a brother yesterday, but his spirit and heart will live on in all of us forever and always,' Lawson wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday.

Wernet's tragic passing comes as yet another blow to the Clemson University community, which has lost five students since June.

A week before the cruise ship accident, sophomore Tucker Hipps was found dead in Lake Hartwell after a run with his fraternity brothers. 

Kendall Wernet is survived by his parents, Bob and Helen Wernet, and his sister, Kaitlin.

‘[He] had a heart of gold and loved to do the right thing,’ Bob Wernet was quoted as saying in his son’s obituary.

Wernet graduated from Roberson High School in Arden, where he was a captain of the cross country and track teams, played in a band, was a member of the National Honor Society and earned a 4.4 GPA, reported WCNC.

Another loss: Wernet's death comes a week after sophomore Tucker Hipps (right) was found dead in a lake after a run with his fraternity brothers 

As a manager at Student Painter, he worked up to 70 hours a week in the summer. He also co-founded his own company called The Driven Vision to inspire the next generation of young professionals.

‘He was the kind of guy, that if you had a daughter, you’d want him to marry her,’ Steve Acorn said.

On Tuesday night, Clemson students came together at Bowman field on campus for a vigil in Wernet's honor.
