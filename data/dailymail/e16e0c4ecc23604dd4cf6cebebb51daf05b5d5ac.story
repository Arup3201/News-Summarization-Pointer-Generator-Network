Watford will be without head coach Oscar Garcia for the trip to Blackpool on Tuesday night after he was admitted to hospital with minor chest pains.

The Spaniard was absent from the Hornets training session on Monday after checking into hospital on Sunday with some chest complaints.

Garcia spent the night under observation as he was assessed by doctors and is set to undergo more tests.

A statement on Watford's website read: 'The club wishes Oscar a speedy recovery and will keep supporters fully updated about the head coach's condition.'

Assistant coaches Ruben Martinez and Javier Pereira will take charge of the game at Bloomfield Road on Tuesday night.

Despite falling to a narrow defeat in his first game in charge at Charlton, Garcia will take comfort in the fact the Hornets currently sit firmly poised in the play-off positions after six games played.

Garcia took over from Beppe Sannino after the Italian was fired by Watford earlier this month.
