A fake paramedic  jailed for tricking a terminally ill pensioner into thinking he was a real medical worker and even drove his own ambulance has been sent back to prison for 'befriending vulnerable people'.

Joshua Martyn had bought a fully marked paramedic first response vehicle and medical equipment online, despite having never completed anything more than a basic first aid course.

The 21-year-old from Hove, East Sussex, was jailed for 18 months in August after he admitted fraud and theft charges, but was released in September as he had served most of his sentence while on remand.

However, he was returned to prison earlier this month after breaching his licence by 'befriending vulnerable people', Sussex Police said. 

Martyn first came to police attention in 2010 while pretending to be a paramedic. However, because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a health professional, police found there was little they could do to stop him.

He was eventually arrested in September 2011 for fraud and assault on a 71-year-old woman he was living with in Crawley, according to police.

Difficulties: Police said that because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, they found it difficult to know how to deal with Martyn

He had moved in with the woman, convincing her that he was medically trained, but in reality had no such qualifications. 

In March 2012, he was convicted at Lewes Crown Court of using an uninsured and untaxed vehicle, three counts of battery in relation to the 71-year-old woman, and two counts of driving without a licence.

He was sentenced to a six-month hospital order and banned from driving for six months.

However, just two months later, police were told that he was staying with a couple in their 80s in West Hoathly, near East Grinstead, West Sussex, whose concerned family were not convinced he was a registered paramedic.

Last March, Martyn was convicted of fraud and assault against a terminally ill 80-year-old man from West Hoathly but cleared of one charge of witness intimidation.

He was sentenced to five months imprisonment at a youth offenders’ institution and given a restraining order banning him from contacting the 71-year-old woman in Crawley.

He admitted further charges of fraud and theft when he appeared at Hove Crown Court in August this year, and received the 18 month prison sentence.

'Joshua Martyn adopted personas that put him in contact with vulnerable people and in a position of trust,' said Pc Jacqui Thornton.

'He was well known in the community and fooled people into thinking he was qualified to administer medical care.

'He dressed as a paramedic, drove a marked ambulance response vehicle and carried medical equipment.

'It is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, therefore it was difficult to deal with Martyn’s activities and behaviour.

'It took me three years of investigation to obtain the evidence required to put Martyn before the court for various offences linked to his activities.'

Pc Thornton said Martyn’s case was not the first of its kind and that she was working with the South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) to raise awareness and to amend legislation which protects those who are vulnerable and those who need medical care.

Paramedic David Davis said: 'This case specifically highlights a current inadequacy in the law in that it is not currently an offence to impersonate a paramedic, or for that matter a nurse, doctor, physiotherapist or a social worker.

'Members of the public can always check to see if their paramedic or other allied health professional or social worker is registered, by visiting the www.hcpc-uk.org or doctor www.gmc-uk.org or nurses/midwives www.nmc-uk.org.'
