Britain and its NATO allies spent billions freeing Libyans from the evil clutches of Colonel Gaddafi, but what exactly has replaced him?

Democratic elections are still some way away, there's serious unrest in several cities and today a United Nations report reveal that up to 8,000 pro-Gaddafi supporters were being held by militia groups in Libya.

Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay claimed they are being held in appalling conditions and are being abused and tortured.

While Amnesty International state that detainees have died after being tortured by militias in detention centres.

Tension: Libya's former rebel fighters, at a checkpoint near the town of Bani Walid. The new government says it will strike back if Gadaffi 
supporters were behind deadly clashes in the town.

Their claims were strengthened by 
allegations of brutality in Misrata by the aid agency Medicins Sans 
Frontieres, who have pulled out their staff.

The organisation's medical staff said
 they were were being asked to patch up detainees mid-way through 
torture sessions so they could go back for more abuse.

The agency said it was in Misrata, 
about 130 miles east of the Libyan capital and scene of some of the 
fiercest battles in the conflict, to treat war-wounded detainees but was
 instead having to treat fresh wounds.

Meantime, the UN's Mrs Pillay said the problem was down to militias working outside of government control.

She added: 'The lack of oversight by the central authorities creates an environment conducive to torture and ill treatment. My staff have received alarming reports that this is happening in places of detention that they have visited.'

Abuse claims: Ibrahim Mohammed says he was tortured at the 
hands of the Gharyan city forces earlier this month. His claims support assertions by the United 
Nations that torture and violence is widespread

General Director of MSF Christopher Stokes reinforced the UN assertions and said: 'Patients were brought to us in the middle of interrogation for medical care, in order to make them fit for more interrogation.

'This
 is unacceptable. Our role is to provide medical care to war casualties 
and sick detainees, not to repeatedly treat the same patients between 
torture sessions.

The agency said it has raised the issue with the authorities in Misrata and with the national army.

'No action was taken,' said Stokes. 
'We have therefore come to the decision to suspend our medical 
activities in the detention centres.'

Rights
 groups have repeatedly raised concerns about torture being used against
 people, many of them sub-Saharan Africans, suspected of having fought 
for Muammar Gaddafi's forces during Libya's nine-month civil war.

Regime change: The UN insist abuses are still commonplace following the fall of Libyan dictator Gadaffi, right. While yesterday Libyan Defence Minister Osama Juili, left, said that the government was control of the country.

Reports of the mistreatment and 
disappearances of suspected Gaddafi loyalists have embarrassed Libya's 
ruling National Transitional Council (NTC), which had vowed to make a 
break with practices under Gaddafi and respect human rights.

The allegations are also awkward for the Western powers which backed the anti-Gaddafi rebellion and helped install Libya's new leaders.

The NTC has appealed to its citizens not to carry out reprisals against Gaddafi loyalists and it says it will investigate any abuses. There was no immediate comment from the NTC on the aid agency's allegations.

The ability of the government in Tripoli to rein in torture is limited because, in most cases, it is carried out by locally based militias who are outside the NTC's chain of command.

Human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday it had evidence of several detainees dying after being subjected to torture, including some in Misrata.

It quoted one man who said he had been tortured earlier this month in the headquarters of Misrata security forces.

'They took me for interrogation upstairs. Five men in plain clothes took turns beating and whipping me,' Amnesty quoted the man as saying.

'They suspended me from the top of the door by my wrists for about an hour and kept beating me. They also kicked me.'Â
