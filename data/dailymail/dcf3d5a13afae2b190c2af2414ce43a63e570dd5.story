David de Gea should be talked about in the same breath as the best goalkeepers in Premier League history, according to Gary Neville.

The Spain international was man of the match as Manchester United beat Liverpool on Sunday and his current form for Louis van Gaal's side has seen him attract huge praise.

Neville highlighted the importance of giving him a new deal and claimed De Gea's recent improvement should see him compared to some of the all-time great keepers.

Speaking on Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football, Neville said: 'I'm measuring him against (Edwin) Van der Sar, (Peter) Schmeichel, David Seaman  - probably the three best goalkeepers in Premier League history.

'We're seeing a huge improvement. He's always been a great shot stopper, he's been doing that since day one. 

'Crosses (are) the part of his game that he still got that bit of improvement to do but if you look at the improvement he's made from where he was three years ago it is absolutely staggering.

'He caught 56 per cent of crosses in his first season, this season he is catching 91 per cent. That is what a Manchester United goalkeeper, one who is playing at a world class level, has to do. 

'A goalkeeper should save seven or eight (one-on-ones) out of 10. They should save the majority of them. The best goalkeepers save the majority of their one-on-ones and this to me is his biggest change.

'He's winning Manchester United match after match, which is what I would expect from a Manchester Untied goalkeeper.

'Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said it was a performance he had not seen in 15 years of going to Old Trafford and I would agree with him.

'He has now become a great goalkeeper, a fantastic goalkeeper. 

'Manchester United are ranked third in the league in the most errors leading to shots but in errors leading to goals they're the best in the league because their goalkeeper pulls them out of the mire every single time. 

'It's fantastic performances, great goalkeeping and Manchester United have got to get this lad signed up because he's a big, big player for them now.'
