Hollywood may have the cult hit Snakes on a Plane, but a Brisbane animal welfare group is gaining attention with its snake in a bag video: a short clip showing a very deadly, and very agitated, brown snake trying to evade capture from a very calm female reptile wrangler.

The minute-long clip features footage of an Eastern Brown Snake – the second most venomous land snake in the world – continuously raising itself from the floor in a defensive pose after it was found slithering around the lounge room of a home in Sinnamon Park, suburban Brisbane.

Feeling cornered and intimidated, the snake hides under a side table and tries to slip out the balcony door looking for an escape route, all the while continuously rearing up at the camera.

Deadly: An Eastern Brown snake gets cornered in a Brisbane home.

In steps snake-wrangler Steph Robinson, who calmly uses her bare hands to grab the snake, prod it with a snake hook and then place it safely into a big black bag.

Ms Robinson’s husband Bryan from Snake Advice and Relocation uploaded the video of his wife’s impressive battle with the ‘brownie’ onto the Snake Catchers Brisbane Facebook page as a way to educate people and ‘give a little perspective from the snake’s point of view.’

‘Remember this snake is on a slippery tile surface where it is not afforded its normal movement with some big human hanging over the top of it,’ Mr Robinson wrote.

‘To put yourself in the snake’s position, it’s like you being in the water whilst a shark circles around.’

Trying to escape: The brown snake slithers across the tiled floor.

Defensive: The agitated snake continuously raised itself up from the floor

Mr Robinson told the Courier Mail that when snakes are inside a confined locality, ‘they just get really nervous’, and despite their aggressive demeanour they do not want to attack.

‘They'll actually push towards you to get you back away, and then try and find themselves some space,’ he told the paper.

‘They’re not looking to bite – they don’t want confrontation. They just want you to back away so they can take off.’
