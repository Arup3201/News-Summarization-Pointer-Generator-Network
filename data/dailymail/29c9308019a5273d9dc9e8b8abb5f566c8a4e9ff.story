Neglect: Tiffany Nicole Klapheke claims her military husband's deployment left her too stressed to care for her three children

Less than a week before a 22-month-old child was found dead in her urine-soaked bed, a Child Protection Services supervisor closed the case - despite it being 11 months since the home had been visited.

Tamryn Klapheke suffered from dehydration and malnutrition and weighed only 17.5 pounds when she died. She also had chemical burns on her face and body, indicating she was exposed to human waste for a long period of time.

Her mother, Tiffany Nicole Klapheke, 21, was charged with 
three felony counts of injury to a child in connection with her daughter's death and the severe neglect of her two other 
daughters, aged six months and three years.

She said she was depressed over her husband's deployment.

On August 22, Texas CPS caseworker Claudia Gonzalez closed the case without making a required final visit to the family or having someone approve the case's closure.

Tamryn died on August 28 at an Abilene hospital after being found unresponsive at her Dyess Air Force Base home.

Because of this, and a series of other errors by CPS workers in Abilene, the agency is now the center of a rare criminal investigation, according to the Houston Chronicle.

'The Abilene Police Department is actively investigating the local CPS office,' Chief Stan Standridge confirmed, declining to give any other details.

When Tamryn died, the agency had a backlog of almost 500 cases, with each caseworker handling a load of more than 60 at a time.

The Klapheke's children had been the 
subject of three previous neglect investigations between April 2010 and 
September 2011.

Though neglect had been ruled out in all three, between the last
 visit and the time of Tamryn's death, a lot had changed within the home.

Tiffany Klapheke had given birth to a 
third girl, lost her job and said goodbye to her husband Thomas, 
who had been deployed to Oman.

When questioned by police, Klapheke said she was 'stressed out and depressed' and had no help looking after her children or the home.

'I just got tired of always changing the sheets, so it was on there a little bit longer than it should have been,' she said.

Klapheke recalled her impatience over her children's potty training, saying she left her toddler in the crib in her own urine for nearly a week.

CPS records show that she had a boyfriend in the home at the time of Tamryn's death, also an active duty service member.

Tamryn's sisters now are in foster care together.

CPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins told 
the Houston Chronicle: 'We are providing a great deal of support and 
services to the father, and everyone involved in the case has agreed 
that this is what is best right now.

'He is visiting both girls in the home regularly, and our hope is that the family can be reunited.'
