The saying goes that your body is a temple but in these fans cases they are more of a shrine to their favourite celebrities.

The days of a few posters on the bedroom wall and maybe a T-shirt from the concert of your No.1 pop star are long gone.

Nowadays, super-fans are showing their devotion by having their idol's face etched permanently on their body.

In the 21st century, devoted fans regularly undergo painful tattoos as a tribute to their favourite singer, movie star or sporting hero. While some are a small inking that is easily concealed, others are murals that cover a person's entire back (Pictured: Cathy Ward with her Twilight design, left, and Talia Lenore with her Michael Jackson tribute, right)

In the 21st century, it is not uncommon for super-fans to undergo a little inkage in support of their favourite star, band or movie.

Some devotees go as far as to cover their whole backs in murals to a film they are particularly fond of, while others make do with a permanent imprint of their hero's autograph.  

It seems that the general rule is, whether it's Michael Jackson, Miley Cyrus or Twilight, when it comes to tribute tatts, subtlety is not an option.

Here we reveal some of the most devoted fans and their many inkings: 

TWILIGHT

CORONATION STREET
