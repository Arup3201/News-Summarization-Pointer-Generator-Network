She's busy forging a career as an art dealer in New York but that doesn't mean Princess Eugenie is immune to the lure of a little time off - even if some work is involved.

The royal, 24, was spotted enjoying the sunshine in Miami, where she joined friends at Art Basel Miami Beach - an offshoot of the prestigious Swiss art fair.

Dressed in a relaxed black jersey dress, a pair of mirrored aviator shades and a battered pair of Converse, Eugenie looked every inch the art enthusiast as she admired the wares on show.

Arty day out: Princess Eugenie was in Miami for the Miami Beach edition of Art Basel

The princess, who studied Art History, English Literature and Politics at university, moved to New York last September for a three month internship which later turned into a £25,000-a-year job with online auction house, Paddle8.

Since moving to the US, she has become a stalwart of the Big Apple social scene and was at the charity auction thrown by the Duchess of Cornwall's brother Mark Shand on the evening of his fateful fall.

In the autumn, she was spotted enjoying a day out at the US Open tennis final, where she sipped champagne with entrepreneur Phil Winser, 29.

Despite missing the biggest social event of the New York year - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's three-day tour - Eugenie appeared to be enjoying herself and looked relaxed and happy as she strolled through Miami's hip Wynwood area.

Amusing: Not even a crowd of bizarrely dressed anti-art protesters could dampen her enthusiasm

Not even a group of anti-art protesters dressed in an array of bizarre costumes could spoil her day, with the princess left chuckling in their wake.

Art Basel was founded in 1970 and stages annual shows in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Miami Beach, all of which focus on modern art.

Included in the displays at the Miami event are paintings, drawings, sculptures, installations, prints, photography, film, video, and digital art by over 4,000 artists. 

200 museums and galleries from Europe, the US and Latin America submit work to the annual event, among them pieces by up-and-coming artists as well as paintings by more established names.
