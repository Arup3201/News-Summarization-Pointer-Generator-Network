Ronald Reagan bedded more than 50 of Hollywood's leading ladies at a luxury LA hotel bungalow, according to a sensational new biography.

During his time as a young 'B-movie' Hollywood actor, Reagan courted screen sirens including Marilyn Monroe, Doris Day, Joan Blondell and Lana Turner at the three-bedroom bungalow in the grounds of the Garden of Allah hotel in Hollywood, the book claims.

The revelations are made in a biography to be published on Valentine's Day titled Love Triangle: Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman & Nancy Davis, reports The Sunday Times.

According to the book's author Darwin Porter, Reagan was involved with around 50 women in Hollywood. 

'Nearly all of them spoke fondly of Reagan - even if they did not share his right-wing politics, they felt he was a nice guy,' said Porter, a journalist. 

'But he suffered from what he jokingly referred to as 'leading- ladyitis.' 

The claims are made in a biography to be published on Valentine's Day titled Love Triangle: Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman & Nancy Davis. Left: Joan Blondell and right, Lana Turner - the book claims Reagan slept with both of the actresses

The book claims that Reagan was considering marrying Doris Day,  (pictured) who would go on to become one of the biggest musical stars of the 1950, but he went on to marry another actress, Nancy Davis

He was accompanied by his neighbor Errol Flynn, who once boasted that he had spent 12,000 to 14,000 nights having sex.

The liaisons were facilitated by Warner Bros which set him up dates with actresses to  push their talent further into the spotlight.

In 1940 Reagan married actress Jane Wyman, but the book claims he was not faithful to her and he embarked on an affair with the star of The Oomph Girl, Ann Sheridan. 

It also claims that Jane was also being unfaithful and was sleeping with actor Lew Ayres (Ginger Rogers’ ex) while filming the Oscar-winning Johnny Belinda.

They had two children - although one of them died -  and the book claims that when their marriage fell apart in 1948, he became involved with a young Marilyn Monroe.

According to Phil Karlson, a director who introduced them, Reagan described her as 'sensational', to which she replied: 'I'm even more sensational when you get to know me,' reports The Sunday Times.

The book, which goes further than any previous biographies, claims that Reagan was considering marrying Doris Day, but instead married another actress, the future first lady, Nancy Davis.

She dated Clark Gable and Robert Stack before marrying Reagan in 1952.

The book also focuses on Nancy who it states 'began her career posing for cheesecake in a failed attempt by the studio to turn her into a sex symbol.'

Under the influence of Nancy's family, he switched from being a Democrat to being a Republican and staunch anti-communist before becoming the 40th President of the United States, serving from 1981-1989.

He died in 2004 at age 93 after a long decline into Alzheimer's and was buried at his presidential library in Simi Valley, California.

The book is in stark contrast to the Disney film being made about his life. 

Called Reagan, the film will be told from the point of view of a KGB officer who was tasked with keeping tabs on Reagan from his actor days in movies such as Bedtime for Bonzo.

David Henrie, who is best known for playing Selena Gomez's older brother on the Disney channel show Wizards Of Waverly Place, will play a young Reagan in the $25 million indie film. 

Henrie will play Reagan in his teens and 20s, beginning with his time as a lifeguard, college football star and through his time as a radio announcer before he moved to Hollywood.

The film is adapted by Space Cowboy's Howard Klausner and based on two biographies by Paul Kengor. 

Henrie is the first cast member to be announced.

This will be the first biopic made for the silver screen about Reagan, who is still a beloved icon for millions, especially Republicans and conservatives.
