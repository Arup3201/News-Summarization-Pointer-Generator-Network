Suspicious cyber activity has
been detected on the computer network used by the White House
and measures have been taken to address it, a White House
official disclosed on Tuesday.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not
say who might have been responsible for the activity on what was
described as an unclassified computer network used by employees
of the Executive Office of the President.

The Washington Post cited sources as saying hackers believed

The hackers did not damage any systems, but some services were disrupted while computer security officials worked on containing the breach, the newspaper reported.

'In the course of assessing recent threats we identified
activity of concern on the unclassified EOP network,' the White House official said.

'Any such
activity is something that we take very seriously. In this case
we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the
activity.'

The official said the technical measures to address the
activity had led to limited access to some EOP network services. 

Some of the issues have been resolved, but the work continues.

'Our actions are ongoing and some of our actions have
resulted in temporary outages and loss of connectivity for some
EOP users,' the official said.

A second administration official told Reuters there were no
indications that classified networks had been affected.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and the National Security Agency are all involved in the investigation, officials said.

The Post said the security breach was discovered two to three weeks ago. It said some White House staff were asked to change their passwords. Citing unnamed sources, the paper said intranet or VPN access was shut off for awhile, but the email system, apart from some minor delays, was never down.

The government created US Cyber Command, a military organisation whose specific task is to protect vital government and private sector computer systems in the country, in 2008 after US military computer networks. Russian intelligence services were also suspected in that attack.
