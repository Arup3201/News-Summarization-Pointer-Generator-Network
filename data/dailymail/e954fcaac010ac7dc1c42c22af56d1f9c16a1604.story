A New York man burned to death in a freak car fire on Tuesday after the car he was a passenger in hit a piece of metal on the road and ruptured the SUV's gas tank which caused a huge explosion.

The 2013 Toyota Highlander left a dramatic trail of flames in its wake as it burst alight at around 1.40pm on the eastbound section of the Grand Central Parkway on Long Island.

Driver, Akeem Phillip, 26, and 25-year-old Saturne Saint-Surin managed to pull over and escape with minor injuries, but Dale Tulloch, 50, perished in the burning wreck, despite the best efforts of his friends to get to him.

'I saw, like, a trail,' said Phillip to ABC 7. 'I thought maybe it was a metal piece, like the sparks and maybe a little fire.'

'My friend was in the back seat and I was trying to tell him to get up, but unfortunately we weren't able to get him out.'
