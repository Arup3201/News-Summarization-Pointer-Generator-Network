The full scale of the destruction caused in Ukraine by clashes between the country's two factions has been revealed after pro-Kremlin insurgents were forced from one city hall.

These pictures show the carnage left by the militants who fled within hours of Ukraine's richest man ordering his steelworkers to help police 'restore order'.

Citizen patrollers removed barricades and debris from the city hall in Mariupol - Ukraine’s second-largest city in the eastern Donetsk region - after the insurgents left the buildings they have controlled for weeks.

Local patrols began in the city earlier this week after Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man, urged steelworkers at his factories to help police restore order

The patrols began in the city just hours earlier after Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man, urged 
steelworkers at his factories to help police 'restore order' - giving 
residents hope that the latest wave of anarchy was over.

Akhmetov's company, Metinvest, agreed with steel plant directors, police and community leaders to help improve security in Mariupol - which is one of two regions that has declared independence from the central government - and get insurgents to vacate the buildings.

A representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, which had declared independence, was also a party to the deal.

German 
Mandrakov, once the commander of Mariupol's occupied government 
building, said his associates fled while he was ‘forced’ to leave the 
building they had controlled for weeks.

‘Everyone 
ran away,’ he said. ‘Someone is trying to sow discord among us, someone 
has signed something, but we will continue our fight.’

Several 
dozen Metinvest workers, wearing overalls and helmets, cleared out 
barricades of rubbish and tyres outside the city hall building before 
trucks carried it away.

Viktor Gusak, one of the employees helping to clear the streets, said locals were 'tired of war and chaos'.

'Burglaries and marauding have to stop,’ 
he said

The White House approved of today's move with spokesman Jay Carney describing it as a 'welcome development'.

The move is a setback to forces that have 
established footholds in eastern Ukraine and are opposed to the interim 
Ukrainian government in Kiev. 

Carney said a halt to destabilising 
activities, such as the seizure of buildings, was a good development in 
the tense situation between Ukraine and Russia.

Ukraine police spokesman Yulia Lafazan said there were now 100 groups of
 men consisting of two policemen and six to eight steelworkers 
patrolling Mariupol. 

Lafazan credited the patrols for a ‘drastic improvement’ in the city's crime rate.

Burglaries and carjackings became the norm after the pro-Russia 
insurgents asserted themselves earlier this month, bringing in a wave of
 marauding, she said.

The city has seen heavy fighting in the last few weeks, including a shoot-out outside a police station that left one policeman and several insurgents dead.

Steelworker Alexander Zhigula said he volunteered to help because ‘someone has to bring order back to the streets.’

‘The city is sick of crime and chaos,’ he said. ‘People can finally see that they've got someone to rely on.’

Valentyna Tochilina, a 47-year-old resident, said she was relieved to see the insurgents disappear from the streets.

‘For the first time (in weeks), I can go out shopping without fear,’ she said.

Local patrols by steelworkers have forced pro-Russia insurgents to retreat from the government buildings they had seized in eastern Ukraine

In other areas in eastern Ukraine, however, the pro-Russia insurgents continue to fortify their territories.

Outside the strategic city of Slovyansk, an insurgent stronghold for more than a month now, armed separatists installed a new checkpoint on the eastern approaches to the city.

The checkpoint blocks a major highway that links Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city - with the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don across the border.

Mariupol is the second-largest city in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region,  one of two regions that declared independence Monday from the central government in Kiev

Earlier, Ukraine's acting President 
Oleksandr Turchynov urged residents of the eastern regions to stop 
helping the separatists and support the central government.

‘You've
 got to support the anti-terrorist operation so that we could defeat 
terrorists and separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions together,’ he 
told parliament.

‘The actions of the terrorists are threatening lives and welfare of the people.’

Europe is ‘sleepwalking’ into war with Russia over Ukraine, Germany’s elder statesman has warned.

Former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, 95, said the Ukraine crisis is ‘increasingly comparable’ to the period leading up to the First World War and blamed the European Commission and NATO for misreading the worst east-west tension since the end of the Cold War. 

Mr Schmidt, who led West Germany from 1974 until 1982, said ‘the situation to me seems increasingly comparable’ to the eve of war exactly a century ago.

‘I think very little of talking up the threat of World War III, and especially of demands for more money to arm NATO,’ he told Bild daily. 

‘But the danger that the situation gets ever more tense, as it did in August 1914, is growing day by day.

‘Europe, the Americans and also the Russians are acting the way author Christopher Clark describes the start of World War I in his book, like “sleepwalkers”.’

The best-selling novel The Sleepwalkers, by the Australian historian, re-evaluates the eve of the First World War, focusing on how clueless the leaders of Europe’s great powers were about the carnage of the industrialised war that would follow.

Warning that EU commissioners ‘understand very little’, he stated: ‘The latest example is the attempt of the European Commission to annex Ukraine, and also to try to draw in Georgia. 

‘Just a reminder: Georgia lies outside of Europe. This is megalomania, we have no business being there.’

In Brussels, officials had blundered by ‘confronting Ukraine with the apparent choice of having to choose between West and East’, he said.

He called on MEPs to grab back power from the commissioners. 

The statesman’s blast came as the United Nations warned of an ‘alarming deterioration' of human rights in eastern Ukraine.

A report warned of a litany of ‘targeted killings, torture and beatings, abductions, intimidation and some cases of sexual harassment’, carried out by anti-government groups in the east.

The devastating report comes ahead of the May 25 presidential election in Ukraine, which pro-Russians are seeking to disrupt, according to the West and the Kiev government. 

In a clear reference to Moscow, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, called on those with influence on armed groups in the east ‘to do their utmost to rein in these men who seem bent on tearing the country apart’.

She also voiced deep concern about ‘serious problems’ of harassment and intimidation facing the Tatar community in Crimea, which was taken over by Russia in the face of international outrage.

Vladimir Putin has acted to ‘rehabilitate’ the Muslim population for the repression under Stalin and said yesterday it would lead to improvements for this group in Crimea, annexed by Russia. 

However, Moscow castigated the UN report for ‘total absence of objectivity, the flagrant irregularities and the double standards leave no doubt that the authors have carried out a political order on whitewashing the self-declared authorities in Kiev’.

Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said it was ‘deeply regrettable’ that the UN report ‘justifies the criminal punitive operation in southeastern Ukraine’ while ignoring pro-Russian victims in the spiralling conflict.
