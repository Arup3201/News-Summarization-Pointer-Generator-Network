It seems that Lottie Moss is keen to follow in her sister's footsteps in more ways than one.

First she modelled for Calvin Klein Jeans - 21 years after Kate did her first campaign for the brand - and now she's hitting the fashion party scene.

Lottie, who recently  modelled for Calvin Klein Jeans x mytheresa The Re-Issue Project, put in an appearance at the party at Rosenfield Porchini to celebrate her latest work.

Wearing a midnight blue dress, which swamped her tiny frame, and snakeskin heels, Lottie looked composed and glowing as she posed for photos.

Lottie, who has been snapped up by Storm Models - the agency that discovered Kate at New York's JFK airport in 1988 aged 14 - is the star of Calvin Klein Jeans and mytheresa's new campaign and bears a striking resemblance to her older sister in the new imagery.

With a fresh-faced natural beauty and unkempt hair, 16-year-old Lottie has clearly picked up a few tips from Kate, who is a long-time Calvin Klein muse. 

The Calvin Klein Jeans 'x mytheresa.com The Re-Issue Project' features modern, limited-edition versions of nine of the brand’s most iconic pieces.

Designed by Calvin Klein Jeans’ Global Creative Director, Kevin Carrigan, the archival styles have been updated with modern fabrications and technology, and will be offered in multiple colours.

Making a good impression: Photographer Michael Avedon said Lottie truly represents the essence of the Calvin Klein girl, describing her as having 'intriguing innocence with utter beauty' 

Speaking about the range, a spokesman for mytheresa.com, said: 'This Calvin Klein Jeans capsule is all about a nostalgia for the Nineties and that whole look feeling very right again.

'It now feels like the perfect time to re-issue the brand’s iconic hits to a new generation.'

Lottie was photographed wearing key pieces from the brand by Michael Avedon.

Bright young thing: Storm snapped up Lottie and she's being tipped by fashion insiders as a star of the future

In-keeping with the full-circle nature of the project, Michael is the grandson of renowned photographer Richard Avedon, who shot the iconic 1981 Calvin Klein Jeans campaign featuring Brooke Shields with the famous tagline: 'You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing.'

On shooting the portraits, Michael said: 'Lottie truly represents the essence of the Calvin Klein girl.

'Intriguing innocence with utter beauty - it was wonderful to photograph this beautiful young lady.'

Lottie was taken on by Storm Models when she was 13, but they had not released any professional photographs until the model's 16th birthday in January.

Flashback: Lottie's half-sister Kate lent her modelling expertise to Calvin Klein when she was 18 back in 1992

Lottie - the daughter
 of Kate's father Peter and his second wife Inger - was one of the 15 bridesmaids when Kate and Jamie Hince married in 2011.

Storm quickly signed the willowy teenager and she's being tipped by fashion insiders as a star of the future. She is already collecting a legion of fans, with an impressive 6,000 followers on Twitter.

Speaking
 about the signing at the start of the year, Storm said: 'Now that she has turned 16, we 
are pleased to welcome Lottie on to our client roster on our New Faces 
division at Storm. 

'However, as she is in full-time education, she is concentrating on her exams and this is her focus.'

Watch out, Cara Delevingne!
