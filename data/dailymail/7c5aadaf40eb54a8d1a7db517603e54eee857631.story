It is always satisfying to get a beautiful picture of a landscape, mountain or lake that you have visited. 

Gregor Skoberne, however, takes dedication to the next level by photographing Slovenia's Lake Bohinj every day during summer, and experimenting with paragliding to capture its reflective surface from different angles.

The  lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia, perfectly mirroring the surrounding mountains in its waters.

Reflective beauty: The stunning Lake Bohinj in Slovenia is less well-known than the popular Lake Bled, and is in pristine condition due to the lack of tourists

Lake Bohinj's orientation results in fascinating light which is perfect for capturing its surrounding mountains and reflections

Lake Bohinj is not as famous as popular tourist destination, Lake Bled, but the lack of visitors allows the area to maintain its pristine condition.

Photographer Gregor Skoberne, 23, became so spellbound by Lake Bohinj that during summers he now works for the local tourist association in order to be closer to photograph it, as he lives 30 minutes away.

'I was amazed that every day there was something different at the lake, be it light, clouds, fog, reflections or different colors of the leaves,' he said. 

'Secondly, I love symmetry and taking reflection shots and Lake Bohinj surrounded with mountains is perfect for that.'  

Taking to the skies! Gregor enjoys capturing the lake from all angles, including capturing reflections of the clouds while paragliding

To photograph the lake from varied perspectives, Gregor has even gone so far as climbing to the top of nearby waterfall Savica

The lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia

The Slovenian's interest in photography started when he received his first digital SLR camera, his father's Nikon D70s

Gregor now uses a Nikon D5100 with the Nikkor 18-105mm and 12-24mm lenses to capture the stunning Slovenian lake

The Agronomy student, 23, is currently doing a master thesis on visualization of root growth using Time Lapse technique, but hopes to do something professionally that's connected with photography.

'When you see something beautiful in nature, it’s hard to describe another person what you saw and how amazing it was, so I’m trying to capture that on my camera so others can enjoy that too,' he said. 

One of his most challenging shots occurred following a climb down a stone wall to get to the Savica waterfall. However, the resulting photograph was one that only a true artist would have been able to create.

But for Greggor, the best photograph that he has taken of the body of water was while flying above, thanks to the spectacular reflection of the clouds on the lake.

His photography can be followed on Facebook and Instagram.
