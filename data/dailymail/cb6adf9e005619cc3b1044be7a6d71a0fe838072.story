A party is always better with a pinata, but these creepy ones that stray in looks from their intended characters may not do much to lift the mood at a gathering.

In Disney's film Frozen, for example, Olaf is a goofy, cuddly snowman but this version makes him appear sinister - while SpongeBob SquarePants is surprisingly hairy and Peppa Pig could easily be Peppa Fox.

Mexican couple Melesio Vicente Flores and Cecilia Albarran have been making and selling their high-end pinatas - which are stuffed with candies and broken open with a stick during parties - for 25 years.

And it's not just children they cater for, as can be seen by their pole-dancing pinatas.

Mexican couple Melesio Vicente Flores and Cecilia Albarran have been making and selling their high-end pinatas - which are stuffed with candies and broken open with a stick during parties - for 25 years. Pinata designs pictured include a hairy SpongeBob SquarePants (left), President Enrique Pena Nieto (centre) and Peppa Pig (right) which could easily pass as Peppa Fox

Together the Vicente-Albarran family create 40 to 60 pinatas per week with perennial favorites including Spider-Man and Buzz Lightyear. A Sleeping Beauty pinata is pictured above - Albarran said 'princesses never go out of fashion'

Now in their 50s, the pair started making pinatas in 1989 and have expanded the family business to include their daughter Elvia Vicente Albarran and son-in-law Guillermo Luna Martinez.

Together the Vicente-Albarran family create 40 to 60 pinatas per week, with perennial favorites including Spider-Man and Buzz Lightyear, as they work from their four-story shared house built into a hillside on the east side of Mexico's sprawling capital.

Working from their rooftop, cement molds are covered in the shapes of body parts with newspaper and are then laid out to dry. 

On the lower floors, mother and daughter cut newspapers into strips, coat them in glue made from wheat flour and layer over gaps. Vicente assembles the pieces into completed characters.

After drying in the sun, the pinatas are brought inside to be painted. Colorful paper and tape create eyes, hair styles and costume details.

It takes about two days to complete a pinata during the dry season and twice as long during the rainy season.

'It's hard work and there are lots of things to do, so there is no chance of getting bored. Time flies,' said Albarran.

The more elaborate pinatas sell wholesale for 180 pesos ($12) but other vendors are selling them for less using cheaper materials making competition stiff. Three other rooftops full of the drying figures are visible on the hillside below the couple's workshop and home.

'Before we sold 100, now we sell 50 in a week,' said Vicente. 'We earn just enough to get by.' 

The family's designs include characters such as Mickey Mouse for children's birthdays or caricatures of despised politicians for protests. 

Characters from the Disney hit 'Frozen' currently appear to be top sellers in local markets and Albarran said 'princesses never go out of fashion.'

Gerardo Moreno Alejo, who sells pinatas at La Merced, one of Mexico City's biggest markets, said university students requested pinatas of President Enrique Pena Nieto last year amid anger over the disappearance of 43 students from a rural teachers college. 

While competition may make it more difficult to sell pinatas, the Vicente-Albarran family hope to keep making them as long as possible.

'We are not here to make ourselves rich,' said Albarran. 'We like our job.'

To make the figures, strips of newspaper are glued from wheat flour onto the pinata molds. Their designs include Mickey Mouse, Spiderman and Buzz Lightyear
