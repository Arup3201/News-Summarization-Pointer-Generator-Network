In the Crystal Palace boardroom on Saturday there were hushed tones and quiet conversations taking place between the club’s owners.

It was the first time they had met since the resignation of sporting director Iain Moody on Thursday and the decision to pull the plug on the potential appointment of Malky Mackay.

They are numb, shocked by the nature of the allegations and disappointed that a valued member of the technical set-up at Selhurst Park has left. Still, they have vowed to fill the void.

Tall order: Parish knows he will find it hard in choosing someone who can match Pulis' success at the club

Palace need a manager, someone to take them through the transfer window and beyond as they attempt to establish themselves in the Barclays Premier League.

There is a temptation to appoint Keith Millen, who served under Ian Holloway and Tony Pulis, as the interim manager until another name emerges.

The transfer window is another added pressure and there is a feeling within the club that they need to add some names to a squad who finished 11th in the Barclays Premier League last season.

Millen has been speaking with the club’s scouting staff this week and intends to put forward some names as Palace plan for the future.

There is a perception within the game that Palace’s co-chairman Steve Parish picks the players and is reluctant to spend big on new recruits. The reality is he prefers to cut out the middle man, negotiating directly with the selling club in an attempt to cut costs. It is sensible planning, even if it grates with some agents.

When Palace wanted to buy Gylfi Sigurdsson from Tottenham in the summer, Parish phoned their chairman Daniel Levy.

A few days later, when Levy was trimming the fat from his squad at Spurs, he offered German midfielder Lewis Holtby to Palace.

In the summer, when Pulis was plotting Palace’s strategy, a budget of around £25 million was set aside for incoming players. It is still there.

Pulis’ name is a ghost in the corridors at Selhurst Park, stalking the club after he left, by mutual consent, 48 hours before the season’s opener against Arsenal.

Palace are still wondering why he really left. Until Pulis breaks his silence, no one really knows.

This week, in Palace’s central London offices, Parish’s email has been going off every few seconds with the CVs of managers all over the world.

Sometimes the introductions are so vague it is impossible to tell whether the candidate concerned even knows he has applied for the job. Some managers have three, sometimes four, people claiming to be their official representative.

Resignation: Sporting director Iain Moody (centre) had no choice but to resign from his role at Selhurst Park

Earlier in the week he had Moody there to help him, talking to agents and potential managers about the prospect of succeeding Pulis.

All that changed when Moody went ‘white as a sheet’ after receiving a call from Sportsmail about the text messages he exchanged with Mackay when they were together at Cardiff.

Within minutes he was sprinting to his lawyers and attempting to stop the story that ultimately led to his demise.

Identifying the next Palace manager is Parish’s world now, sifting through applicants ranging from former Italian World Cup captain Fabio Cannavaro to Colombia’s World Cup coach Jose Pekerman.

None of them fits the bill. Parish wants someone who knows the ropes, a manager who has worked in the Premier League and kept teams out of the bottom three.

He is prepared to wait, just as he did when Ian Holloway left last October.

Until Thursday, Parish had the option to appoint former Spurs manager Tim Sherwood, but he since withdrawn himself from a race he described yesterday as ‘like the grand national’.

Palace want a manager with pedigree, a name the players will respond to on the training ground.

Pulis had that aura and was a commanding figure when he addressed the players. Replacing him will not be easy.
