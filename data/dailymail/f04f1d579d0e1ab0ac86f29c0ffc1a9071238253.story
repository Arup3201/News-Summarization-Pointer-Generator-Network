A teenager is to receive an award after going through his entire school career without having a single day off sick.

Thomas Kent, 16, of Salendine Nook, in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, never missed a day through primary or secondary school.

And not even a broken arm he once suffered, and needed an overnight stay in a hospital, could keep Thomas from his classes - it conveniently happened during his school holidays.

The teenager said of the award: 'I'm delighted.

'It is something of which I can be proud forever.

'I was conscious of it as I went through school but never realised it would stretch from reception class to college'.

Proud mother Karen, 48, also a teacher, said: 'It's great he is receiving some recognition. To have a 100% attendance record over 12 years is a fantastic achievement.'

Thomas was a pupil at Reinwood Infant and Junior School before moving up to Salendine Nook High School.

He left in the summer with a perfect record and the praise of teachers ringing in his ears.

Now studying for A-levels in maths, physics, chemistry and medieval history at Greenhead College, Thomas will return to Salendine Nook next week for the school's annual awards night.

Thomas - deputy head boy last year - will receive two awards: one for his 100% attendance record and the other for Outstanding Contribution to School Life.

Mrs Kent, a supply teacher at Reinwood, said Thomas had always been fit and healthy despite being born prematurely and weighing just 4lb 6oz.

'He was very small and born at just 32 weeks,' said Mrs Kent. 'He was in the special care baby unit for three weeks but it never held him back.

'He's had the odd cough and sneeze but we've always dosed him with Calpol and sent him off to school telling him to see how it goes. Fortunately, he's always stuck it out.'

Thomas caught chickenpox from his sister Emma, before starting school and when he had an accident on a zip wire and broke his arm two years ago he managed to maintain his record.

'It was Spring Bank week so even then he didn't miss any schooling,' said Mrs Kent.

Thomas, who is a young leader with Oakes Cubs and Beavers and also an Explorer Scout with Northern Stars at Salendine Nook, hopes to go onto university but doesn't know what career he wants to pursue yet.

Ahead of next week's awards ceremony, former teachers have lined up to pay tribute.

Karen Butler, head at Reinwood Infants, said: 'I do remember his attendance and attitude towards learning was fantastic and he was presented with a 100% attendance award whilst in year two.

'He was a delightful young man and I'm sure his thirst for knowledge and enthusiasm for learning spurred him on to attending every day!'

Nathan Kirby, head of year at Salendine Nook, said: 'From Thomas's first day to his last he was a model pupil. He will be a student I will hold up as an example to others for years to come.'

His form tutor at Salendine Nook, Ken Moore, added: 'Tom was brilliant. For me he was the go-to guy.

'If ever I needed to know what was going on regarding school life, and by that I mean stuff I was supposed to know being a form tutor - I went to him and he knew!

'A model pupil. If they were all like Tom the job would be worth doing for free.'
