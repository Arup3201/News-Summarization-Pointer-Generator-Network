Couples having trouble conceiving will soon be  able to carry out fertility treatment in the comfort of their own home.

A leading high street chemist is offering a DIY  kit called The Stork that copies a form of fertility treatment called intrauterine insemination (IUI).

It will be available for just £100 – a fraction of the £1,000 cost of going to a private clinic for a course of similar treatment.

High-street baby-making: The new DIY fertility treatment kit The Stork copies a form of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and is designed to be used at home

Its makers say the device ‘helps bridge the gap between natural intercourse and in-clinic assisted treatments such as IUI and IVF’.

They claim a success rate of about 20 per cent, comparable to the same treatment carried out by a doctor.

However, studies on  the method found that pregnancy rates between those in the programme  and couples who dropped out and conceived without therapy were about the same.

The Stork, pictured above, which is now available  online from Superdrug, is supposedly designed to help couples with ‘common fertility difficulties such as low sperm count, low sperm motility, ovulation timing and unexplained infertility’.

It works by first collecting semen into a cervical cap, which is located at the  bottom of a condom-like sheath.

An applicator then delivers the cervical cap containing the semen to the entrance of the cervix.

The cap is left next the cervix for between four and six hours, then removed using a tampon-like pull cord.

The cap keeps the semen as close to the cervix as possible to allow sperm to swim up to the egg. The makers maintain that normal daily activities can be carried out while the cap is in place.

It is recommended that  The Stork be used just before and/or during ovulation.

Gynaecologist Nick Morris, of the Wellington Hospital in London, felt the device had a place for some couples but pointed out that The Stork was not exactly the same as IUI.

Under IUI, sperm is collected and ‘cleaned up’ before being placed into the woman’s womb close to the time of ovulation.

‘This would be an ideal option if a couple can  no longer have treatment  on the NHS or cannot afford to self-fund at a private clinic,’ he said.
