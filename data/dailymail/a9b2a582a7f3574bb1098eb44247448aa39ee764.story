Accused: Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner have been charged with harassment after putting up security cameras around their house

A former House of Lords special adviser was yesterday accused of using security cameras to spy on a teenage girl next door.

Political aide Desmond Hughes, 65, and his partner were charged with harassment after their neighbours alleged the couple had rigged up cameras to watch their house.

A court heard that Hughes also stared at Tania Hancock, 18, through her bedroom window.Miss Hancock said her family moved in next door to Hughes and his partner Clare Anderson, 50, in 2011, in the wealthy Cardiff suburb of Old St Mellons.

The couple had lived there  since 2006.Hughes claimed he had mounted the devices after receiving ‘security advice’ from ‘senior officers from ex-forces’.

But Miss Hancock told the court the couple erected surveillance cameras aimed ‘on to our back garden and pointed directly on to our drive’.

She said: ‘It was directly angled. It wasn’t pointed on to his property – just ours. I’m certain it was pointing directly on to our garden.’

Miss Hancock also accused Hughes and his partner of staring at her through the window of her bedroom.

‘They would always look up at my window,’ she said. ‘I was always aware of that from the moment I moved in.

‘They would stand there with their hands on their hips staring up at my bedroom until I moved away from my window.

‘I thought it was odd behaviour to stand and stare up at somebody.’

Adam Corbin, prosecuting, asked when the alleged staring had stopped.

Miss Hancock told Cardiff Magistrates’ Court: ‘It hasn’t stopped. It’s whenever they’re on their drive.

'My mum would always tell me to 
ignore them but it got to the point where I felt really intimidated by 
them. Whenever I’m in my bedroom now my curtains are always drawn.’

Giles Newell, defending, said Miss 
Hancock ‘can’t be sure what exactly these cameras are focusing on’ and 
that she had ‘never asked why they have got those cameras’.

Police officer Christopher Fennessy 
confirmed there were a number of cameras on Hughes’s property. But he 
said no evidence of recordings had been found during a search of the 
house.

Hughes said: ‘My security advice comes from the security industry as well as senior officers from ex-forces.’

He admitted he had three cameras 
attached to both the front and back of his house when the Hancocks moved
in next door, and said that he owned an extensive collection of 
‘firearms, shotguns and various explosives’.

But he added: ‘I’ve never had cause to point the cameras in the direction of either the Hancocks’ garden or driveway.

‘They’re just placed there and that was the end of it – they were placed there in 2006.’

He said most of the six cameras were 
not even working. Mr Newell told the court Hughes and Anderson had no 
previous convictions and the situation between the couple and the 
Hancock family had ‘become melodramatic’.

Both defendants have denied harassment.

District Judge Bodfan Jenkins adjourned the case to today when he is expected to give a verdict.
Hughes was a special adviser to Labour’s Lord Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale.

The peer became MP for Birmingham 
Erdington in 1983, and held the seat until he joined the Lords in 2001. 
He died in February last year, aged 78.
