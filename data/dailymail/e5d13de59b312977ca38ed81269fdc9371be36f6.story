Tragic: Daphne Fishpool's determination to park her car correctly caused her death in a 'bizarre' accident, an inquest heard. The pensioner is pictured

A pensioner’s determination to park her car correctly caused her death in a 'bizarre' accident, an inquest heard.

Daphne Fishpool, 76, reversed her car into a space before heading off for Sunday lunch with her husband John Fishpool, 70.

But Canterbury Coroner’s Court heard Mrs Fishpool  was not satisfied because the wheels were not straight and insisted on correcting them.

The retired shop assistant went back to the car and leaned inside to put the key in the ignition, but the car jerked backwards and the open door knocked her to the ground.

Mrs Fishpool died in hospital four days later from complications following a fracture to the left femur of her thigh.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Miss Cobb said: 'It is such a shame that she died as a result of trying to do something so simple.'

Mrs Fishpool, from Herne Bay, Kent, had planned to have Sunday lunch at the Prince of Wales pub in Hoath, Kent, with her retired local government officer husband Mr Fishpool  on May 20.

Canterbury Coroner’s Court heard Mrs Fishpool reversed into a parking spot but she was not satisfied she had left the wheels straight and insisted on correcting them.

She opened the car door and leaned inside, but as she put the key in the ignition, the car 'appeared to jump backwards' and the door knocked her to the ground.

She was taken to hospital, where it was found she had suffered a fracture to the left femur of her thigh.

The operation was delayed until May 22 because Mrs Fishpool was taking Warfarin for an irregular heart beat.

The day after surgery, she became drowsy and her blood pressure was not recordable and she became short of breath.

Doctors initially thought Mrs Fishpool, who passed away on May 24, might have suffered a stroke.

But a post mortem examination revealed her death was due to septicaemia and pneumonia following the femur fracture which had been repaired.

The inquest heard there had been no evidence Mrs Fishpool was suffering from a chest infection on admission, and hospital tests the day after the operation revealed her chest was clear.

Mr Fishpool questioned the speed with which the pneumonia set in as his wife had only been immobile for less than two days after the operation.

But pathologist Dr Salim Anjarwalla said the pneumonia could have been due to immobility following the operation and said the condition can develop rapidly.

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
