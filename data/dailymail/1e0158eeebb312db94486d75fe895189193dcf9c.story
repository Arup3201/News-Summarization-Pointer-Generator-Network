Andrea Pirlo has been called up to the Italy squad for their European Championship qualifying matches as a replacement for the injured Giacomo Bonaventura.

Pirlo had announced before this summer's World Cup that he would quit playing for the national team after the tournament. 

However, the Juventus midfielder reversed his decision when Antonio Conte took charge of the Azzurri, telling his former club coach he would be available for selection.

The Italian legend's outing against Roma was his first appearance after more than a month out injured 

The 35-year-old Pirlo returned to action on Sunday after more than a month out with a hip injury.

Bonaventura reported to the Italy camp with a right thigh injury and the Milan midfielder withdrew from the squad after tests on Monday afternoon. 

Italy host Azerbaijan in Palermo on Friday before making a short trip to visit Malta three days later.
