Nintendo is set to release a new miniaturised version of its ground-breaking Wii console in the UK in just a month's time.

The Japanese video game maker, which has sold nearly 100 million Wii consoles worldwide, today announced the scaled-down version of the machine will hit the British high street on March 24.

Smaller than the original Wii - which has since been superseded by the Wii U - the Mini will come in matte black with a red border.

'Savagely compromised version of the original hardware': Nintendo is set to launch its Wii Mini in the UK next month, but the slimmed down version of their last-generation console has already been savaged by video gamers

No price has yet been announced, but it is currently on the market in Canada for the budget price of $99 CAD (around £63).

Nintendo also announced that it would be expanding its discounted range of Nintendo Selects games with Mario Party 8, Mario Power Tennis, Wii Sports Resort and Super Paper Mario.

However, video games websites have already laid in to the slimmed down machine, with one describing it as a 'savagely compromised version of the original hardware'.

The original Wii: Launched in 2007, nearly 100million of the consoles have since been sold worldwide

Nintendo became a household name in the Eighties with its first console, the Nintendo Entertainment System, popularly known as the NES.

Its star shone brighter with the subsequent Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or SNES, but the subsequent entry of big hitters like Sony and Microsoft into the video games market proved a challenge for the company.

Nineties arch-rival Sega was beaten out of the console market altogether and Nintendo found itself occupying a younger niche as adult gamers turned to the more sophisticated PlayStation and Xbox.

The Wii, released in 2007, broke new ground with its motion-sensitive controllers, however, allowing Nintendo to market the first video games which could be controlled by the movement of players' bodies.

In a statement today, Nintendo said: 'With a family-friendly design offering no internet capabilities, Wii Mini allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched.

'To coincide with the launch of Wii Mini, Nintendo is also adding to the existing range of Nintendo Selects titles, offering great value for everyone to enjoy classic Wii games.'

Since 1983, when it launched the NES, Nintendo has sold more than 4billion video games and more than 651 million hardware units globally.

It has also created industry icons that have become well-known, household names such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Zelda and Pokémon.

However,  video games industry observers have criticised the release of the Wii Mini as something of a misstep by Nintendo.

Nintendo's Wii U console: Nintendo has returned to the black for the first nine months of its business year and more than doubled its profit forecast for the full year, despite pessimism about sales prospects

In a product review of the console, Richard Leadbetter, writing for Eurogamer.net, said: 'What we have here is a crippled version of a six-year-old console that offers the absolute base level of functionality - and nothing more.'

He added: 'Unfortunately, the sad reality is that the Wii Mini disappoints on almost every level.

'It's not a good-looking piece of kit at all, functionality has been stripped down to the absolute bare-bones, and perhaps worst of all for a product actively being marketed on its dinky form-factor is the fact that it's not actually that much smaller than the original model.'

It emerged today that Nintendo had returned to the black for the first nine months of its business year and more than doubled its profit forecast for the full year, despite pessimism about sales prospects.
