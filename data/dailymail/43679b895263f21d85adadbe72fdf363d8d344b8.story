A beauty queen turned lawyer who was 
jailed for a drunken hit-and-run has written a letter to her victim saying she is 'really, really sorry' - but insisted she had no idea she had hit him.

Kristina Long, 26, was jailed for 12 
months after being found guilty of crashing into museum technician David
 Robinson, catapulting him 80 feet into the air, while she was driving 
home drunk from a work Christmas party held at the Reebok Stadium in 
Bolton.

Although he claims she initially refused to take the blame for his extensive injuries, Mr Robinson said Long had now written to him to apologise after his lawyers demanded she help pay for his recovery from fractures to the neck, spine, pelvis and leg, and bleeding on the brain.

Long, who competed in international 
beauty pageants while at university, was jailed for 12 months in February and is currently held at Styal women’s prison in Cheshire.

She had been driving at twice the legal 
drink drive limit when she crashed into Mr Robinson and left him for dead at a pedestrian 
crossing in Salford on December 15, 2012.

Speaking today, Mr Robinson said: 'I was upset by the way she drove off and left me - that is the thing that resonates and is the most painful thing about it all.

Describing his reaction to her letter, he added: 'She didn’t really seem to take responsibility for it all, she kept saying she just had two glasses of wine but she was double the legal limit and that was quite a while after driving that they had tested her.

'During her court case she implied she had panicked but in a letter she sent me she said she was very sorry... She said said she was really, really sorry for what happened to me and that she had only had two glasses of wine and that she didn’t know she had hit something.'

'But I don’t actually believe that. One thing that came out of the trial is to see the photograph of the car damage and it was clearly a hard hit.'

Denial: Long, who was a trainee lawyer at the time of the crash, was arrested two hours later but spent up to a year claiming she was not responsible for the hit-and-run

The accident happened when Long was driving a group of friends home from a Christmas party their employer had organised at the Reebok Stadium in 
Bolton.

Long had just entered a 20mph zone but was traveling at 30mph when a friend 
started vomiting in the back seat of her Vauxhall Corsa due to the 
effects of alcohol.

Distracted, Long collided with Mr Robinson and then continued her journey into 
Manchester City Centre, leaving Mr Robinson lying badly injured in the 
road until a passing motorist called an ambulance.

In court Long said she knew she had 'hit someone', which appears to contradict what she wrote in her letter.

Mr Robinson spent a month in Salford Royal Hospital with two fractures to his 
spine, two fractures to his leg which required surgery, a pelvic 
fracture, neck fractures and a bleed to the brain.

Kristina Long was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for two years at Manchester Crown Court after being found guilty of crashing into David Robinson (right) while over the alcohol limit

But in February she was jailed for 12 months after she pleaded guilty to dangerous
 driving causing serious injury, failing to stop at the scene of a 
collision, and driving with excess alcohol.

She was also disqualified from driving for two years, but told the court she had no intention of driving again anyway.

In March it emerged that Mr Robinson’s lawyers at Irwin Mitchell were taking 
legal action over the accident and were currently agreeing a figure with 
Long’s insurers to pay for his recovery.

Mr Robinson, a bachelor who creates displays at Salford Museum and was walking home from his own Christmas party at the time of the accident, has already needed several operations and external frames to be fitted to help with his recovery and faces a long rehabilitation battle.

Describing his recovery, he said: 'At the time of the accident I had booked a ski holiday and was very happy with the way my life was going.'

'I don’t remember anything about the impact itself but I had to spend the next 10 months having additional surgeries to correct his right leg which was fractured in many places.'

'I basically had a broken neck and obviously the brain injury so we didn’t know if I was going to be able to lead a normal life... I had a metal frame around my leg with steal pins going into the bones.

'I couldn’t walk and it could be incredibly painful. Some of the breaks didn’t heal properly so then I had to have another metal frame with metal wires through the bone.

Long won beauty pageant Miss Bolton and also represented Northern Ireland in a beauty pageant in South Korea before turning her attention to law, where she got a job at UK firm Keogh's

Banned: Long pleaded guilty to a series of driving offences and was jailed for a year, as well as being disqualified from driving for two years. She told the court she had no intention of driving again anyway

Drunk: Long, who competed in international beauty pageants while at university, was driving at twice the legal drink drive limit when she crashed into Mr Robinson at a pedestrian crossing in Salford

'I used to love swimming, walking my dog and running before the crash but I am not mentally quite as fast I think. I am just trying to go through normal life using pain killers and I plan ahead any activities I do now otherwise I will be laid up for a couple of days, Mr Robinson said.

‘I think the year sentence seems about right, even though she will do less than six months actual time. I don’t think she would have benefited from being in prison for any longer,' he added.

'I suppose I feel slightly sorry for her and that she has had to go to prison but then I do feel irritation about the process of law and her pleading not-guilty... A person able to take responsibility would have just said 'well yes I am guilty'.'

During
 the trial, Manchester Crown Court was told Long had spent four hours drinking wine 
and vodka at a work party held at Bolton’s Reebok Stadium by her law 
firm Keogh’s.

When it was revealed that Mr Robinson would be seeking damages, his 
lawyer Matt Brown said: 'This was a horrific accident that could have 
been avoided had the defendant driver thought about the possible 
consequences of her actions.

'Drink
 driving is extremely dangerous and this case highlights the impact it 
has on the innocent victims that are left seriously injured,' Mr Brown added.

'Also
 in this case the defendant failed to take responsibility for her 
actions and cruelly pleaded not guilty for a long period of time before 
changing her plea very late in the day.'

'This
 dragged the criminal proceedings out far longer than necessary having a
 further impact on David and his family as they were unable to fully 
concentrate on his recovery.'

Police found 45mg of alcohol 
on Long's breath almost two hours after the incident - meaning she was 
likely to have be at least 61mg in her body at the time of the crash. The legal limit is 35mg.

Long's car was also severely damaged from the impact with Mr Robinson.

Long,
 from Altrincham in Greater Manchester but originally from Belfast, 
competed in World Miss University in 2010 representing Northern Ireland,
 where she won the 'Miss Speech' award.

After graduating she became a lawyer at Keogh’s.
