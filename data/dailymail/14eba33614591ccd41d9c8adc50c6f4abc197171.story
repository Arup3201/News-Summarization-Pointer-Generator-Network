Liverpool and Arsenal have experienced rather similar seasons in quite a few respects.

Brendan Rodgers and Arsene Wenger have come under pressure in relatively equal measure but seem to have ridden the storm for now.

Neither possess a defence you would happily lock your valuables behind, nor a goalkeeper to store too much faith in – or his understudy. Attacking flair has been present but ultimately each have underwhelmed so far.

But usually there is a a sharp edge to matches between these two and Sunday at Anfield promises an intriguing contest. Each side needs a result to boost the positive shoots of recent victories.

In goal Liverpool are likely to turn once again to Brad Jones, who has shown in two games why it took so long for Simon Mignolet to get shifted to the bench. Diving out of the way for Wayne Rooney’s goal at Old Trafford like an out-of-control FIFA player was bad enough, before his error for Dan Gosling’s consolation in the Capital One Cup.

Wojciech Szczesny will be in net for Arsenal and on occasion can look the commanding keeper Wenger wants. But he remains unconvincing at an elite level that the likes of David De Gea, Thibaut Courtois and Joe Hart are on.

In front are two defences that have been roundly criticised repeatedly. Liverpool’s has got worse than last season under Rodgers and at times seems to have as much organisation as a Christmas party dance floor when the free bar has been drained.

Dejan Lovren, Martin Skrtel, and Kolo Toure fall some way short of a side with Champions League aspirations, while Rodgers’ three-at-the-back formation is yet to impress.

On the Arsenal front, Per Mertesacker was slaughtered for his bizarre display in the defeat at Stoke while Calum Chambers needs time to settle. He is playing many more minutes than in his breakthrough season at Southampton. Injuries have led to a muddled selection on occasion.

But Arsenal overall have defenders, when fit, more comfortable in their roles, and this is borne out in the statistics. They have conceded 19 goals at a rate of 1.19 per game - the fifth best record in the Premier League.

Liverpool have let in 22 to place 11th in the division in that aspect – at a rate of 1.38 per game.

The pressure put on their defence is shown by their far greater number of blocks, clearances, and interceptions made: 804 (ninth-highest) to Arsenal’s 660 (18th).

Liverpool’s options in midfield are myriad but the new signings have yet to spark. Adam Lallana has probably done best so far. Steven Gerrard looks like a man frustrated that a talent like Luis Suarez is no longer on the end of his passes.

Arsenal have possibly even more options in this area, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain improving, Aaron Ramsey beginning to find his feet again, and Santi Cazorla reinvigorated.

Unsurprisingly, each side ranks highly for short passes and some way down the list for long balls. Arsenal have made 8,417 short passes to come second, Liverpool 7,018 to place seventh. Long balls see Arsenal bottom (715) and Liverpool 16th (915). Overall completion levels are 85 per cent for Arsenal and 84 per cent for Liverpool.

In attack is where these teams divide clearest. Alexis Sanchez has been an instant hit, Olivier Giroud looks in fine nick and Danny Welbeck provides another option.

For Liverpool, Mario Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League, Daniel Sturridge has struggled repeatedly with injury, and Rickie Lambert’s dream move has not quite turned out that way.

Liverpool have only scored 19 goals and sit mid table in this regard (10th), while Arsenal have hit 28 to rank fourth in the division to date. Total shots sees Arsenal on 194 (second) with Liverpool on 157 (seventh) while shots on target is 47 per cent for Arsenal and 45 per cent for Liverpool. A small margin but it means Arsenal have the fourth best rate for shots testing the goalkeeper to Liverpool’s 11th.

A victory for Wenger’s mean on Sunday would add credence to Liverpool detractors who believe those places could be replicated in the real Premier League table come May.
