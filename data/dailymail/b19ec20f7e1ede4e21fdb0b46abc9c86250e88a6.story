A passenger and his family were thrown off a commercial airliner in Nepal’s capital after he allegedly slapped a cabin crew member during a row.

The scuffle occurred just before the SpiceJet plane was scheduled to fly frustrated passengers from Kathmandu to New Delhi, India following a five-hour flight delay.

Both sides are denying blame as the 67-year-old man, identified as PK Maheshwari, claims the cabin crew member struck his foot, while the Indian low-cost airline alleges he assaulted the woman.

As the situation escalated the pilot intervened and ordered the man, his 62-year-old wife and a nine-year-old family member to leave the Boeing 737.

According to the Times of India, Mr Maheshwari, from the New Delhi suburb of Greater Kailash, filed a complaint that claims he fell asleep and was suddenly jolted awake by a flight attendant.

He wrote: ‘The stewardess had hit my foot with considerable force, though the aisle of the aircraft was clear.

‘(She) started shouting at me that my foot was in the aisle.’

The man denies slapping the woman and claims she struck his foot while he was asleep

He denies slapping the woman but admits that he was involved in a ‘sharp exchange of words’ which led to his wife apologising on his behalf.

Mr Maheshwari, who is seeking compensation and an apology, said the airline threatened to call the police if the family did not disembark.

A SpiceJet spokesman told the Times of India that a passenger slapped the employee in front of other travellers.

The spokesman added: ‘There is zero tolerance of this kind of physical abuse of crew anywhere in the world, including India and therefore the captain made the decision he did, which is fully within his authority, is backed by relevant regulations and is fully supported by management.’

After leaving the plane, Mr Maheshwari said he could not afford to buy new plane tickets, so he and his wife and the child made the long journey home on a 30-hour bus ride.
