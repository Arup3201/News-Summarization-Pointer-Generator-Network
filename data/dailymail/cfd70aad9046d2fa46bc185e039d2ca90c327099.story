Could this be the ultimate summer snack? It's not unusual to have a big bowl of popcorn and your favourite tipple while chilling out but now you can combine the two.

Cocktail-flavoured caramel popcorn has been invented containing five per cent real booze!

The Willy Wonka-style concoction comes from award-winning popcorn pioneers Joe & Seph's, who are leading the way when it comes to 
innovative British food and drink.

The new adult range comprises four different varieties - Gin & Tonic, Mojito, Margarita and Cosmopolitan

The new adult range comprises a collection 
of classic cocktails in four different varieties - Gin & Tonic, 
Mojito, Margarita and Cosmopolitan - perfect for serving as snacks or as part of an indulgent dessert.

The Latin flavours of the Mojito and Margarita varieties might be just the ticket during the World Cup.

Joe & Seph's say they use an innovative 
'flavour-sequencing' technique, which unlocks different taste elements, 
one after the other.
