Alan Pardew saw his half-time rant pay off instantly as Newcastle fought back to beat Tottenham 2-1 and climb out of the relegation zone.

After Emmanuel Adebayor had given the hosts an early lead, the under-fire Toon boss tore into his players at the break and sent on striker Sammy Ameobi, who equalised six seconds after the restart.

Fellow substitute Remy Cabella then set up Ayoze Perez's winner.

Alan Pardew turned Newcastle's game at Tottenham with two substitutions and an angry team talk

'There were a few strong words,' admitted Pardew. 'I reminded them about the fundamentals of a Premier League game and we came out with a much stronger attitude.

Ayoze Perez then marked his first start for Newcastle with the winning goal for Pardew's side

'We were a bit unlucky because we lose Papiss [Cisse] just two hours before the game

'We'd worked all week thinking that he'd be fine so it was a bit of a shock to lose him. His knee was swollen today as a reaction to yesterday's training.

'So we had to go with Perez and I knew that probably wouldn't suit him but we needed to give it a go because of the way we'd worked all week.

'We were giving too much possession to Tottenham, too much space.'

Pardew deserves credit for the half-time introductions of Ameobi and Cabella - a move he said was down to offering a threat.

It clearly helped move Newcastle's performance up a level, as did his half-time 'team talk'.

He added: 'We just said to them after, it's not nice as a manager to go in and bark out orders but sometimes it's necessary just to shake people up because we needed shaking up.'

Things would have been so different had Spurs showed a cutting edge in the first half.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino believes they deserved more from a display undone by Ameobi's sucker punch.

'It was a shock because after that it all changed in this moment,' said the Argentinian, who was not even back in his seat when the substitute scored.

'Seven or six seconds before, all was happiness and there was good energy in the stadium. Our supporters were happy and believed that we would get a good result.

'But in this moment, I think it was difficult to manage in our head. Our heads had gone and we started to take rash decisions on the pitch.

Remy Cabella (centre) was another second half substitution that helped turn the game in Newcastle's favour

'It was difficult because 12 or 14 minutes later, we conceded again another goal. At 2-1, it was difficult.'

Pochettino's main complaint after the match was the lack of mental strength displayed by the Tottenham squad.

It undid what he called their best half of their season on what is not the first time the Spurs boss has bemoaned his players' mentality.

'It is not something where you can analyse the action, sort the tactical situation and move the players,' Pochettino said.

Erik Lamela had an uninspiring game after impressing in midweek in the Europa League for Tottenham

'With mentality, we need to work hard. It is not easy. We need to be more strong, like a team. This is our challenge.

'We need to speak, we need to create a different situation on the training ground and work.

'We know how but always you need to spend time to work in this area. It is not the same as in physical or tactical situations. It is a different area.'
