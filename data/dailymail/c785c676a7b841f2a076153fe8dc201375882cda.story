Gift: Quiet Manhattan widow Mary McConnell Bailey left $20 million to the New York Public Library and Central Park

A quiet Manhattan widow shocked friends by giving a pair of $10 million checks to the New York Public Library and the Central Park Conservancy before she died.

Mary McConnell Bailey, who preferred track suits over designer frocks and didn't care much for expensive jewels, left the checks for her two favorite institutions before her death in February of 2011, the New York Post reported. She was 88 years old. 

The library and the conservancy, a nonprofit that looks after the park, were shocked after receiving the checks for $10 million each. The money was sent by Bailey's estate.

Friend and neighbor Lizanne Stoll told the Post that she led a quiet, modest life. 

'You never would have known,' Stoll said of Bailey's wealth. 'She was very secretive about it all.'

Bailey lived in a two-bedroom apartment on East 57th Street and 1st avenue in New York that has an estimated worth of $760,000 on the real estate website Zillow.com.

'Her apartment had that 1950s 
fresh-out-of-college look,' Stoll said. 'She had nice antiques, but all 
the art on the walls seemed to be copies from MoMA.'

Bailey's husband died in World War II and she had no children. Born in 1922, she grew up in North Hampton, Massachusetts and moved to New York in her 20s. She never remarried.

When she was young, she attended 
Columbia and volunteered at hospitals and schools.

After her mother died
and left Bailey and her siblings a large inheritance, she began a life 
of philanthropy.

Her family money reportedly came from shares in the Roaring Spring Blank Book Co., which produces the black-and-white marble notebooks that are required materials at most grade schools.

Throughout her life, Bailey has been quietly involved in philanthropy, giving tens of thousands of dollars to a handful of New York institutions.

But her biggest gifts came after her death.

'I met her many times and had lunch with her twice, but I cannot remember her voice - that’s how soft-spoken she was,' John Bacon, the New York Public Library’s director of planned giving, told the Post. 

'She was always neat and careful, but nothing fancy. No jewelry, no nothing. And always a track suit — day, night or otherwise.'

Half of her gift to the library will go to local branches, he said.
