At 91 most of us would be over the moon to have all our own teeth and to be able to stay awake through an entire episode of our favourite television programme.

Few could imagine taking part in triathlons which involve a gruelling test of physical endurance, often for hours at a time.

But Arthur Gilbert, 91, has defied his years to become one of the world's oldest triathletes.

The energetic grandfather stays young by going to the gym three times a week, cycling 25 miles on a Sunday and swimming 50 lengths of his local pool every day.

Yesterday the pensioner took part in the Burnham Sprint Triathlon, in Somerset, completing the 500 metre swim, a 20k bike ride and a 5k run in less than three hours.

Arthur, who has taken part in 41 triathlons, said: 'I came last, but when you’re 91 I think you’re allowed to.

'There was a great crowd here - they cheered me on and helped me get to the end.'

Arthur has always enjoyed running and has competed since the 70s, but at 68, he turned his hand to triathlons.

He said: 'People think I’m bonkers but people inspire me to carry on, and I inspire them to do something like this for charity.'

The former helicopter engineer, who was chosen to carry the Olympic torch this year, has been crowned British duathlon champion seven times.

And has even received royal recognition for his outstanding achievements.

Awarded an MBE for his charity work over 35 years, he was also sent a letter by Prince Charles congratulating him on his previous triathlons and wishing him luck in future races.

The granddad, from Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, attributes his extraordinary stamina to living a stress-free life, giving blood and eating lots of bananas.

He said: 'I started taking it all seriously when I was 68 - I was a bit late getting started so I’ve spent the years ever since then trying to make up for it.

'The secret is staying stress-free, being happy, doing charity work and being positive.

'I don’t drink or smoke and have regular check-ups. I also have a very balanced diet with lots of fruit for breakfast which helps tremendously - I love nuts and bananas.

'Some of it is down to giving blood. The old blood goes out, the new comes in to replace it and rejuvenates you.

'I’ve donated 45 pints of blood altogether since I was 51 and only stopped because I reached the age limit. People think it decreases your performance in life but it doesn’t.

'I have to work really hard at keeping fit. Being disciplined and going out and doing it even when you don’t feel like it is the key to success.

'The training is the hardest part and it’s almost a relief at the finishing line.'

Over the years Arthur has had to overcome the loss of wife Mary, known to family and friends as Betty, to cancer and has also battled against pneumonia.

Arthur, avid member of local running group, Burnham Harriers, added: 'I have a lot of help and I’m motivated by my wonderful family.

'They, along with regular training and the fact this is all for charity, help keep me going.

Taking the plunge: Arthur has always been an avid runner, but decided to take up triathlons later in life

'I raise money for Musgrove Leukaemic Group Somerset which is really close to my heart.

'People are really generous and I really appreciate all their support.

'I must be the world’s oldest triathlete - I’ve never met anyone else still doing it at my age.

'I keep saying I’m going to give up soon, but I always end up going back to do more.

'The triathalon today was my third “last one” - I just can’t give up.'

A Guinness World Records spokesman said: 'We don’t currently have a record on file for the category of oldest triathlete, so we would be interested in anyone who believes they may lay claim to the title.'
