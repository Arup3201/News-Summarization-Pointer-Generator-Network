A vicious thug has been sentenced to nine months in prison after a brawl which left the victim in a coma fighting for his life.

Unemployed Nathan Mhuto, 24, from Bognor Regis, West Sussex, pleaded guilty to affray and common assault after punching Ryan Geall, 20, outside Lola Lo’s nightclub in Brighton last year.

Mr Geall from Lancing, West Sussex, was hit on the back of the head and managed to walk away from the scene, but he 
collapsed on the seafront just minutes later.

At around 3.30am a group of men got into a fight and punches were thrown.

He was initially taken to Royal Sussex County Hospital but was transferred to Hurstwood Park Hospital in Haywards Heath with a bleed on the brain.

Fighting for life: Mr Geall was in a coma for a number of weeks and doctors thought he may not survive

He stayed in a medically induced coma for weeks and doctors thought he might die, but he has since made a full recovery.

Mhuto was charged with causing grievous bodily harm but when his trial started in September pleaded guilty to affray and common assault.

CCTV footage showed some of the fight and with Mr Geall being punched by Mhuto.

Detective Constable Sophie Tullett, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a thorough investigation and thankfully Ryan has made a full recovery; amazing after it was thought he might not survive.

'We worked hard to bring Mhuto to justice for his part in Ryan’s injuries.

'A custodial sentence reflects the seriousness of the assault and Ryan can now begin to move on with his life.

'He has been through so much and is still having physiotherapy to build up his strength.

'We are pleased Mhuto has been jailed and justice has been served for Ryan and his family.'

Mhuto was sentenced to nine months for the affray and three months for common assault, both of which are to run concurrently.
