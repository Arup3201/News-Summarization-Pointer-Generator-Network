Swedish furniture giant IKEA has been left red-faced after the name of one of their products was translated into something less than appropriate.

A customer put the name of £35 pillow Gosa Raps into Google Translate which interpreted it as Cuddle Rape.

The translation of Raps, the Swedish word for rapeseed, was cut in half by the online dictionary, creating the unfortunate combination.

The customer posted the findings on Reddit, but was soon calmed by Swedish speaking users of the site.

Although Cuddle Rape was a result of words ‘lost in translation’, this is not the first time IKEA has found itself in trouble over the meanings of their Swedish product names in other languages.

Hanger Bumerang, knife Slitbar and pot Skanka have all caused much amusement to customers across the world, but there are other products that might sell significantly less were they to be translated into English.

Pillowcase Skarblad, named after a flower, translates into the not-so-romantic sounding ‘cut blade’.

Worse is spatula Gubbrora, a name which makes perfect sense to a Swede set to make the traditional dish after which the product is named, but when translated into English becomes the rather less appetizing ‘old man touch’.

Last year the company hired translators before printing their catalogue in Thai, after it was discovered that some items had a whole different meaning in parts of South-East Asia.

IKEA bed Redalen was found to sound ‘uncomfortably close’ to the word for third base when pronounced in Thai, and plant pot Jattebra, a world which ironically means ‘really good’ in Swedish, sounds like a slang word for sex.

The flat-pack giant was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943, celebrating its 70th anniversary this year.

IKEA is the world’s largest furniture retailer, recording an annual net profit of £3.2billion in 2012, achieving sales of £27.6billion in 44 countries.

In the UK, where the company first set up shop in 1987, it was voted the country’s most popular shop in a survey.

There are more IKEA catalogues than bibles printed each year, and it is said that one in ten Europeans is now conceived on an IKEA bed.
