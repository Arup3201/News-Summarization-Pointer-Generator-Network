When Amir Khan was told that Kell Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn has put Wembley Stadium on hold for the pair of them to fight on June 13, his response was as sharp and to the point as the punches which had just pounded Devon Alexander to defeat in what may prove to be the pivotal fight of his career.

‘How can he book a stadium without even talking to me?’ Khan asked. ‘It’s disrespectful. It would be like me sending a message to Floyd Mayweather that I’ve booked Wembley for next summer and I’m expecting him to be there.’

That said, Khan made it clear that he will examine all possible options for a mega-fight with Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao before even considering a world championship Battle of Britain with Brook.

‘If I just went ahead and agreed to fight Kell it could prevent me ever getting the fight with Floyd or Manny,’ said Khan. ‘They usually box in spring and in the autumn. Boxing Brook in June would rule me out of either of their dates next year – and after that they could both retire.

‘That would kill my ambition to prove myself against the very best. As far as styles are concerned, I would love to fight Brook. He’s slower and defensive and he could not cope with my speed and power. it would be a huge fight in Britain. But only in Britain, not in America or elsewhere. 

'I want to make a global impact and the way to do that is to fight Mayweather or Pacquiao.’

Although Saturday’s brilliant victory represented the last bout on Khan’s contract with Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy promotions, he says: ‘I will talk with Oscar next week about making the super-fights.’

But the picture has been clouded by Mayweather’s sudden announcement that he is ready to meet Pacquiao in the richest fight in ring history, in Las Vegas on May 2.

‘Sky gave me that news an hour before I went into the ring against Alexander,’ says Khan. ‘Nice one boys. But it proved I can put distractions out of my mind and focus on the job at hand.

‘Just as I’ve done what Floyd asked by proving that I’m worthy of fighting him. And remember that he said he would fight me earlier this year but it didn’t happen. Now he’s saying he’ll fight Manny so we’ll see what happens.’

Khan reveals that he has been asked by Paquiao’s business manager, Michael Koncz, if he would be interested in fighting the PacMan: ‘I said yes.’

A match with Mayweather, who stood him up this May, might be easier to make since both he and Khan have the Machiavellian figure of Al Haymon as their advisor.

But Khan remains grateful for all his sparring with Pacquiao – when both were being trained in Los Angeles by Freddie Roach – which prepared him for dealing with southpaws like Alexander in devastating fashion.

‘Nothing can beat working with –and sometimes hurting – the best southpaw in the world,’ he says. ‘Then nothing better than fighting the best boxers on the planet.’

Amir Khan does not put Kell Brook in that category.
