Two more people have been arrested in connection with a house fire in Derby that killed six children.

Duwayne Philpott, 13, and his siblings Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jessie, six, and five-year-old Jayden, all lost their lives following the blaze in Allenton, Derby, in the early hours of May 11.

Police have arrested a 34-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman as part of the investigation into the fire.

The children's parents, Mick Philpott, 55, and his wife Mairead, 31, have been charged with their murder after the fire at the family home.

No more information was released by Derby Police but the arrests coincide with fresh police activity at a property on the same road.

The semi-detached council home has been taped off with forensic science officers entering and leaving.

Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill said: 'These latest arrests are part of the ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fire.

The children were buried in a joint funeral service at St Mary's Catholic Church in Derby last month

'Despite the fact that two people have already been charged with murder, we are continuing our investigation to ensure that all lines of inquiry are completed.

'No further information will be released at this time.'

The six children were asleep upstairs when the fire broke out at the semi-detached house in Victory Road in the early hours of May 11.

Derbyshire Police have confirmed that petrol was used to start the blaze.

Smoke from the fire travelled upstairs to where the children were in bed.

All six died as a result of smoke inhalation, the police have said.

An inquest into their deaths was opened and adjourned at Derby Coroner’s Court in May by Coroner Dr Robert Hunter.

The hearing was told that John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Jade were all certified dead at the accident and emergency department of the Royal Derby Hospital.

Duwayne died of his injuries in Birmingham Children’s Hospital two days later.No causes of death were given during the inquest.
