The NHS Cancer Drugs Fund has done more harm than good by paying too much for new drugs, health economists have warned.

Experts claim that paying over the odds for cancer drugs means the health service is being starved of money to spend on patients with different diseases.

The money spent on expensive drugs would have done five times more good if spent elsewhere in the NHS, they claim.

New research says the drugs rationing body is also approving drugs that are too expensive for the NHS to afford – despite rejecting dozens of other drugs on grounds of cost.

The research found the 'threshold' used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) when gauging the cost-effectiveness of new drugs is too high.

Waste: The money spent on expensive drugs cancer would have done five times more good if spent elsewhere in the NHS, a damning report has claimed 

Many believe the high prices of new drugs are justified because pharmaceutical companies need to recoup the cost of years of investment taken to develop them.

But researchers at the Centre for Health Economics at York University say NHS patients are losing out because the money could be better spent elsewhere, such as filling staff shortages or buying new radiotherapy machines.

Co-author Professor Karl Claxton said 'The increasing pressure to approve new drugs more quickly at prices that are too high will only increase the harm done to NHS patients overall.

'The political pressure to support a multinational pharmaceutical sector cannot justify the real harm that has and will continue to be done to NHS patients.'

The research comes as critics argue that cancer drugs have been given unfair priority in a cash-strapped NHS.

The Government's aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit.

It has led to around 55,000 patients in England getting drugs banned by Nice or awaiting approval since April 2011. 

The Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) bill this year will be £280 million.

However, research by health economists at the University of York has, for the first time, estimated the impact of the drugs fund on other areas of the NHS.

It found NHS outcomes would be better if it refused to fund any drug that cost more than £13,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY).

The QALY is a complex formula used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of a drug – so-called quality adjusted life years (QALY).

This determines the cost of a new treatment by working out how much it improves and extends a life compared with existing treatments.

Nice uses a threshold between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY, but on average it approves drugs that cost £40,000 per QALY and sometimes as high as £50,000, according to the research.

For every £10 million spent on a new drug that costs £40,000 per QALY, 250 QALYs would be gained but 773 lost because the money spent would not be available for other services.

The net harm would be 523 QALYs.

The Cancer Drugs Fund spend this year will buy 4,098 QALYs for individual cancer patients but the health lost elsewhere will be 21,645 QALYs – five times greater, say the researchers.

Professor Claxton said he did not blame drug companies, which were responding to a demand for innovative and expensive therapies, mostly driven by the US market.

Instead he said the NHS should refuse to pay excessive prices and either cut prices unilaterally or bring in a rebate scheme under which companies would reimburse the NHS for drugs that cost more than £13,000 per QALY.

Professor Claxton added: 'We need to find a way of setting prices that reflects the real value in the market. The key is to find a mechanism that can allow that to happen.

'If for political reasons we have to have the Cancer Drugs Fund, at least we should be confronted with the results of that decision,' he added.

Sir Andrew Dillon, Chief Executive of Nice, said of the issue: 'The question is how to balance investing in the cutting edge of medicine with more routine care'

The research was funded by the National Institute of Health Research and Medical Research Council.

Sir Andrew Dillon, Chief Executive of Nice, said: 'The NHS has a choice about whether to use some of its money to adopt new things. It always has done. 

'The question is how to balance investing in the cutting edge of medicine with more routine care.'

'Unless you think that drug companies will be prepared to lower their prices in an unprecedented way, using a threshold of £13,000 per QALY would mean the NHS closing the door on most new treatments.'

'At the other end of the spectrum, we obviously can't just say yes to anything and everything. 

'We don't have enough money and anyway, not everything is worth having. 

'And drug companies need the discipline of a critical market to make sure that price matters.' 

The research is published in the Health Technology Assessment journal.
