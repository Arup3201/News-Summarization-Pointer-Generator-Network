More details have emerged of Kevin Pietersen’s fractious relationship with senior England players and his attempts to undermine captain Alastair Cook in the early stages of last winter’s disastrous Ashes tour.

Pietersen, who was sacked after the tour, for a breakdown in trust with senior management, is expected to blame, among others, former coach Andy Flower along with erstwhile team-mates Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior for his international exile in an autobiography to be released on Monday.

The ECB have drawn up a dossier of offences which led to the 34-year-old’s central contract being torn up when the team returned from Australia, and the Mail on Sunday has learned the South Africa-born star caused problems from the outset of the tour.

‘Alastair Cook and [vice-captain] Matt Prior tried to set up a team dinner in Sydney a couple of weeks into the tour,’ a dressing room insider said. 

‘They invited the whole squad and said it would cost around £70 a head and would be a good thing to do for team morale early on a long tour.

‘KP made it very obvious from the word go he wasn’t interested at all. He came up with all sorts of reasons not to go. He constantly questioned why he should have to fork out the money and completely undermined Cooky’s attempts to put the dinner on.

‘The dinner eventually went ahead but it was soured by KP’s resistance and there’s no doubt Cooky felt let down by a senior player going against what he wanted to do so early in the tour.’
