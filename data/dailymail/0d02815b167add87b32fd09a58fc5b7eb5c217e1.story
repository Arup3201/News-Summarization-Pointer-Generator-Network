A black member of the University of Oklahoma fraternity plunged into scandal after film emerged of them has hit out at his so-called 'brothers'.

William Bruce James II, who is one of just two black men ever to join the university's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, pledged in 2001 - but has now turned his back on the organization.

The footage showed SAE members, riding a bus while wearing bow ties and dress shirts, chanting 'There will never be a n***** SAE' to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It.

Renouncing: William Bruce James II was an SAE pledge in 2001 - but now says he wishes he never joined the frat in the wake of a video showing current members singing a racist chant

Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident

It concluded: 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE'. 

Outraged leaders of SAE's national organization shut down the fraternity Sunday night, and today the University of Oklahoma ordered the members to leave campus.

In the wake of the sickening footage, James published an uncompromising letter on his blog, in which he described how hearing the chant 'hit me in the core of my soul'.

James said that while he was at SAE he never felt as if racism was endemic, but says that in light of the current members' behavior, he wishes he had never joined.

James published the letter on his blog, under the title There Will Never Be Another BLACK SAE, and also spoke to local news station KFOR about his renunciation of SAE. 

He said: 'My former fraternity broke my heart today... to say it was racist is not enough. It hit me in the very core of my soul when I saw the video.

'I know those bus rides well. I was a member of this chapter 14 years ago. The second BLACK MAN to be initiated in those halls. We had our own songs….different songs…but songs we sang on every bus trip to every date party for four years.

'...So now 14 years later, my "brothers" now sing this song. This is what gets their spirits united for a great night out with their friends and their dates (one of which, thank God exposed this …this).

'This is what binds them. But I remember what binded us. I remember the True Gentleman.'

The True Gentleman is the Sigma Alpha Epsilon creed, which extols virtues such as self-control and humility, which members are supposed to strive to live up to.

He continues: 'I thought we were different. Maybe we weren’t. Maybe I was just being hopeful. But I believed. I believed in SAE. I believed in the True Gentlemen.

'I believed my brothers were my brothers. I believed my son should be their brother if he so chose one day. But then I saw that video. I saw that video speaking of lynching me instead of ever letting me sign.' 

Fury: Hundreds of students rallied on the campus in Norman, Oklahoma, on Monday morning to protest the horrific chant by the fraternity members

James concludes: 'I can have no association with this organization as a black man. I know these were “kids being kids” and maybe they aren’t the hateful ignorant lost little boys I think they are, but I will not stand behind anything that allowed this to happen.

'They are not just kids being kids. Those boys are sons. Sons of men who failed them, and they failed my son. You Failed ME! Member 261-057.

'Your boys sang in unison. They may not know where the song came from or who made it up or even what all the words really mean, but they sing it so often they know all the words whether they want to or not.'

It came as SAE members fled the University of Oklahoma campus, on the orders of the university's president.

David Boren today threatened legal action against those responsible, and said he wanted them to go straight away.

He said: 'We will look at all possible punishment and what is available to us under the law. Under the civil rights law it may be possible for us to take action against certain individuals,' he said. 

'Would I be happy if they left voluntarily? Yes. We don't have room for racists and bigots here.' 

He added: 'I don't want them here. I'll pay the bus fare to get them out. They're not coming back.'
