Wigan coach Shaun Wane will give youngster George Williams 'all the time he needs' to secure the club's famous number six spot.

The 20-year-old, born and bred in Wigan, will get the first chance to fill the boots of Australian playmaker Blake Green, who left the Warriors at the end of last season to return to the NRL with Melbourne.

Wane says he never contemplated bringing in a replacement from outside the club as he puts his faith in the home-grown Williams, playing alongside England scrum-half Matty Smith.

'I didn't look at anybody (else),' Wane said. 'I'm quite stubborn, once I go with something, I stay with it, I stick with my convictions.

'He's not under any pressure from me because I know he can play. Whether it happens in the next 10 or 20 games, I'm not that bothered, I'm willing to keep working with him.

'It took Blake Green and Matty Smith a long time to work together and now we're asking a 20-year-old kid to do that.

'There's a lot for George to learn - he's still only very young - but he defends tough and he will learn. He's finding his feet at the minute and I'm willing to give him all the time he needs. There is no doubt in my mind he's going to be a top player.'

Williams is grateful for the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of such famous Wigan stand-offs as Brett Kenny and Shaun Edwards.

'Shaun whispered it in my ear at the end of a training session in our first week back,' Williams said. 'It was a shock but I am really happy. He's put his trust in me and I've got to repay him and show he made the right decision.

'It could be seen as daunting because so many great players have worn the six jersey but I want to make it my own now.'
