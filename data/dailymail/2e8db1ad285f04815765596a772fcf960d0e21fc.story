Row: John Craven, a Christian preacher, was arrested and kept in police cells for 19 hours after he quoted the Bible's stance on homosexuality at two gay teenagers

A Christian street preacher was wrongly arrested and held in a police cell for almost 19 hours after quoting verses from the Bible.

John Craven, 57, recited from Revelation after two gay teenagers asked about his views on homosexuality.

But after he read from chapter 21, verse eight – which says sinners will burn in a lake of fire and sulphur – police arrested him on suspicion of committing a public order offence.

He was taken to a police cell where he claims he was denied food, water and access to medication for his rheumatoid arthritis.

He was fingerprinted, had to give a sample of his DNA and told he was being investigated for allegedly using insulting words with the intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress – which could have led to a six-month jail sentence.

Two days later, however, police told him there would be no charges and no further action.

Yesterday he was awarded £13,000 in compensation after a three-year legal battle against Greater Manchester Police which is estimated to have cost the public purse £50,000.

Mr Craven said: ‘I never intended to cause anyone harassment, alarm or distress. I preach the gospel, which means good news and the love of God for all.

‘At the end of the day God loves everybody, but homosexuality is a sin and I am not going to contradict the word of God.’ He added: ‘The actions of the police have left me feeling nervous and anxious.

‘I was in a cell on my own. I was fingerprinted, swabbed and had my photo taken. They took my shoelaces from me. They said I would not be interviewed until the next day and then they left me.’

Incident: Mr Craven said he was on his usual spot in Market Street in the centre of Manchester, when the men approached him to ask his opinion on homosexuality and claims the two men then kissed in front of him before calling for his arrest

The incident happened in 2011 when Mr 
Craven, who has been street preaching for 14 years, was at his regular 
twice-weekly pitch in Manchester city centre.

Mr
 Craven, who is married, said: ‘Two young lads asked me what God thinks 
of homosexuals. I told them whilst God hates sin, he loves the sinner 
and that according to the word of God homosexuality is an abomination. 
That is not my opinion, it is the word of God.

‘I
 quoted them Revelation chapter 21, verse eight, “But for the cowardly, 
unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, 
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that 
burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death”.

‘This made them upset and they started to do obscene gestures to me. They were trying to provoke me.’

Case: A preacher has won £13,000 from Greater Manchester Police, pictured, who arrested him after he told a gay couple the bible said homosexuality is a sin

The
 boys then told a policeman his comments had caused them distress. The 
constable was alleged to have grabbed Mr Craven roughly by the arm 
before arresting him.

From 
the time of his arrest at 7.15pm until 9.30am the next day he was given 
nothing to eat before eventually being given a bowl of cereal.

Mr
 Craven won damages under the Human Rights Act using his entitlement to 
enjoy the freedom to manifest his religion and freedom of expression, 
including the freedom to impart ideas without interference by a public 
authority.

Colin Hart, 
director of The Christian Institute which funded Mr Craven’s case, said:
 ‘In terms of the infringement of religious liberty, it was one of the 
worst cases we have ever dealt with.’

A
 spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: ‘We acknowledge that we 
did make mistakes and, in particular, kept the claimant in custody for 
too long.’
