The countdown to the New Year began with the Shard lighting up the central London skyline with a dazzling display.

The 72-storey high skyscraper has become home to Western Europe's highest art installation as the capital prepares to welcome 2015.

Every evening until December 31 the spire of the 300 metre tall Shard will come alive and treat Londoners to a spectacular light show from 5pm to midnight.

The festive display will change daily for the next 12 nights and will use beacons, smoke machines, LED panels and projections.

The artwork, called Shard Lights, has been installed on the top 40 storeys of the tower.

It has been created by award winning art collective, Jason Bruges Studio, and aims to 'evoke the spirit, energy and dynamism of London.'

The public piece of art has been designed to celebrate the year The Shard came to life, opening to businesses and the public and becoming an internationally recognised beacon for modern London.

Irvine Sellar, developer and shareholder of The Shard, said: 'The Shard has become a beacon for modern London, and is globally recognised as an emblem of our capital. 

'We wanted to create an unprecedented installation that takes an architectural icon and turns it into a piece of public art as a gift that every Londoner can enjoy during the festive season.

'Shard Lights' reflects the diversity and energy of our wonderful city and will put us on a par with the celebrations in global cities like Paris, New York and Sydney.

'Shard Lights will create a theatre in the sky, and it will be a prominent feature of the London skyline for the twelve days of the project,' 

'It has been an honour to work on this project for such an iconic and internationally recognised building.'
