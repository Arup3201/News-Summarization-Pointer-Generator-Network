After buying this, you may well need to do a bit of belt-tightening of the financial variety.

Bugatti has unveiled an incredible gold or titanium trouser belt which costs more than a new Porsche.

The R22 Bugatti Calibre has been designed to be the Swiss watch of the belt-making world.

It is the result of a collaboration between the supercar firm, best known for its 268mph Veyron, and Roland Iten - a Swiss luxury company.

Using watchmaking machinery, Roland Iten has created a solid rose gold and titanium belt with 100 moving, mechanical pieces.

Each component is custom made and carved by precision laser from a solid block of gold or titanium.

The belt, which is limited to just 11 units, comes with an eye-watering £60,000 price-tag.

This makes it more expensive than a Porsche Cayman  - which costs £48,000 - and the same price as a new Range Rover Sport.

But it is still considerably cheaper than a Bugatti Veyron SuperSport, which will set back a wealthy buyer £1.6million.

Owners of the belt will be able to boast that their accessory, as the Roland Iten website states, is 'micro-customisable to any size within a 22mm range' and can be adjusted 'to the exact waist measurement'.

It describes the belt as being 'a magnificent piece' constructed 'from the finest materials'.
