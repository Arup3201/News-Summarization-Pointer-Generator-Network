There is no shortage of impressive houses in Harpenden, the commuter-belt Hertfordshire town that’s home to City hedge-fund types, high-flying lawyers and the odd footballer.

But none is in the same league as Flowton Priory, a  500-year-old Grade II listed Tudor mansion that has had more care and attention lavished upon it than a king’s mistress.

Its ancient timber frame, oriel windows and ornate herringbone brickwork are easy to fall in love with, as businessman and racing driver David Pinkney did back in the 1980s when a friend of his, the former golf champion Ken Brown, pointed it out.

At that time Flowton Priory wasn’t for sale, but David never forgot it. Years later, he moved to Monaco, but asked Ken to let him know if it ever came on the market. When it did, in 1994, David put in a sealed-bid offer and won by a margin of just £4,000.

The house needed renovating, and over  the next 15 years, David gave it five-star treatment. He carried out major repairs to the roof, completely rewired and replumbed the property, increased the number of bedrooms from five to seven and added  new bathrooms.

He landscaped the three acres of grounds and built an elegant glazed summerhouse from which the Priory can be admired in all its Elizabethan glory.

‘I have given this house everything I could,’ says David. ‘It’s such a beautiful and special building that I wanted everything that went into it to be of the very best quality. I have spent an absolute fortune, but the house has deserved it.’

It is certainly an appropriate setting for the motor-racing trophies that fill the shelves. Until 2010, David was a leading name in the popular British Touring Car Championship, which pits high-performance versions of ordinary saloons – Hondas, Renaults, Fords – against each other at Silverstone, Brands Hatch and other well-known circuits.

Flowton Priory is in West Common, on  the edge of Harpenden. But it wasn’t always in this spot. Its origins are hidden in the  name. For 400 years, the Priory was in the village of Flowton in Suffolk. In the 1920s,  its owner, a member of a wealthy brewing family, had it taken down, transported west and reassembled.

A tree-lined drive leads up to the metal security gates, through which you can see the house, with its nine chimneys, set in immaculate formal gardens with box hedging and lollipop-shaped Ligustrum trees. A walk through the heavy oak door into the entrance hall with an enormous chandelier takes visitors to a 36ft drawing room on the right.

Driving force: David Pinkney in his racing gear

Its oak-panelled walls and huge stone inglenook fireplace date from Tudor times, as do many of the small-pane leaded windows.

Some contain beautiful 16th Century stained glass, with one showing the coat of arms of Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII’s Lord Chancellor, who was born in Suffolk.

Down the passage from the drawing room  is the pink-walled dining room with a vast antique mirror reflecting its 12-seater polished dining table. ‘We’ve had some fantastic Christmases here,’ says David.

No less impressive is the 20ft square kitchen, installed by David himself. Its vaulted, beamed ceiling is supported by enormously thick timber pillars either side of a marble-topped island, above which hangs another giant chandelier.

Beyond, is a sitting room, used as a den by David’s nine-year-old daughter, and a large, well-equipped utility room.

A door leads out on to a pergola-covered terrace complete with a large circular dining table and barbecue. A shiny black hot tub is even equipped with a DVD player and a TV screen that rises at the touch of a button.

A second staircase leads up from this end of the house to two bedrooms and a bathroom, creating a self-contained wing for guests or staff. The main 16th Century staircase takes visitors to the majestic master bedroom and a bathroom.

Two more bedrooms, one each for David’s daughters, the eldest of whom is at university, and another bathroom complete this floor. David spent years collecting furniture and fittings for the house. Unfortunately, he can no longer enjoy the fruits of his labours. He and his wife have separated, so Flowton Priory must be sold. It is on the market with Savills at £8.75 million.

Will David look for another project?

‘No, I couldn’t do anything like this again,’ he insists. ‘It was a fantastic experience, but it takes it out of you. The house I’m planning  to move to is a modern four-bedroom place – very nice but nothing like this.

‘I’m proud that I’ve helped preserve a piece of English history, though.’
