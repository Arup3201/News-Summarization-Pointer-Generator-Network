There won't be any presents under the Christmas tree this year at the Wanoa residence.

Mum Nicky, of Upper Coomera in the Gold Coast - southeastern Queensland, has decided her five children won't be receiving any gifts - not even from Santa - as she plans on teaching them 'the real meaning of Christmas'.

Instead, she told the kids last week they'll be baking 200 cookies and pieces of fudge on Christmas Eve for local families who are in need of their help.

The mother-of-five has received many negative comments, including accusations that she is 'a santa slayer' and 'many swear words'. 

But little Lylah, her eight-year-old son, also has a few choice words. 

'I was shocked because I love presents,' he told Seven News, when asked about his reaction to the news that there would be no Christmas presents this year.

But his mother stands by her decision.  

'There are lots of families around us who are struggling and can't even feed their families,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'This year my kids have been to Disneyland [in the US] and Vegas so I want to teach them that's not normal. I want to teach them there are kids out there who can't even have lunch. So I thought this would be a good opportunity to do that.'

'Christmas isn't cancelled. It'll still be awesome and the kids will be spending more time with family.' 

Ms Wanoa says she and her husband Tee made the decision when their kids logged onto a Santa letter website, where they could choose expensive gifts and put it in their 'virtual Santa sack'.

'Christmas isn't cancelled. It'll still be awesome and the kids will be spending more time with family,' says Mrs Wanoa, who is already planning a lovely big lunch together for the family on Christmas day

'There were no limits and my kids are so naive that they thought they would be getting all the presents they chose,' she said.

'We've already given our kids enough throughout the year.'

Ms Wanoa broke the news to her children - Alamein, 9, Tyler, 8, Willow, 5, Olive, 3, and Elora, 1 - last Monday.

'Every week we have family night and that's when I told them,' she said.

'They were in shock and very quiet at first. But then I tried to explain to them that we'll be spending our time baking and they loved the idea.

'The real meaning of Christmas is being grateful for what we have already. It's known as the day of giving I want my kids to know that this can be a way of doing that.'

She hopes the experience will teach her five children a lifelong lesson.

'I know this won't work in every family but I just want my kids to learn about empathy and to become better human beings who look after one another,' she said. 

'There are so many times where we've gone overboard with presents to see them lying in the backyard and never to be touched after a week or so.'
