Distraught Michelle Simmons was so sure her beloved Labradoodle Gracie had plunged to her death playing during a hike in Oregon on Sunday, that she immediately held a memorial service for her dog on the side of the cliff.

However, as Simmons and her family stood at the top of the 200-foot ravine they heard the unmistakable sound of Gracie barking from down below - sparking a dramatic rescue for the lucky year-old pup.

In total, ten members of the Oregon Humane Society took eight hours to pull Gracie to safety from the steep cliffs of the Columbia River Gorge with a rescue harness and amazingly, she only suffered some scratches and bruises.

Gracie lost her footing as she wrestled with another dog as the Simmons family were returning from Punchbowl Falls.

'We kept hearing her rolling and rolling, she yelped out and we though we had lost her,' said Simmons to KOIN6.

Bruce Wyse of the Humane Society was the team member who pulled Gracie to safety and reunited her with her grateful family.

Rene Pizzo, the team leader reminded the Simmons family that the accident happened in the first place because Gracie was allowed off her leash.

He said that the accident and successful rescue effort should act was a warning to other hikers to keep their pets under control at all times.

Gracie fell just before 5pm on Sunday and a relieved Simmons told KOIN6 that she believes it was astounding her dog was not hurt.

'She was barking, wagging her tail,' said Simmons. 'It was a miracle, no one believed it.'

'She’s totally fine. We are almost gonna leave her there.'

Speaking of her gratitude towards the Humane Society team who rescued her dog, Simmons called the 'absolutely amazing' and said that she thanked every single one.
