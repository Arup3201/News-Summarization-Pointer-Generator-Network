Capt. Gregory McWherter, a former commanding officer of the Blue Angels, is accused of 'tolerating an inappropriate work environment' in two spells as leader between 2008 and 2012

A former commanding officer of the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron, the Blue Angels, has been removed from his current post after accusations that he ‘tolerated an inappropriate work environment.’

Capt. Gregory McWherter allowed, and in some cases encouraged, sexually explicit humor and inappropriate comments among members of the famed precision flying team, the U.S. Navy contended on Wednesday.

McWherter was relieved of duty as executive officer of Naval Base Coronado on Friday after a complaint was filed with the Navy's inspector general about an ‘inappropriate command climate’ at the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron based at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

During his
 two stints as Blue Angels leader between 2008 and 2012, McWherter 
‘tolerated an inappropriate work environment within the squadron which 
may have violated the Navy's sexual harassment, hazing and equal 
opportunity policies,’ a Navy statement said.

‘The complaint alleges that lewd speech, inappropriate comments, and sexually explicit humor were allowed in the workplace and in some case encouraged by the commanding officer,’ and that ‘pornographic images were displayed in the workplace and shared in electronic communications,’ the statement said. 

McWherter is a graduate of the Navy's Fighter Weapons School, known as Top Gun, and won the 2003 Commander Naval Air Forces Leadership Award

‘All Navy leaders, whether assigned to a highly visible unit like the “Blues,” or to our installations, squadrons, ships and submarines, are held to the highest standards,’ Vice Admiral David Buss, commander of the Naval Air Forces, said in the statement.

‘The Navy expects everyone, from those officers in command positions to sailors on the waterfront, to provide principled and highly ethical leadership, stressing discipline, accountability, and the importance of treating shipmates with dignity and respect.’

The Blue Angels are continuing their training and there have been no changes to their performance schedule, the Navy added. McWherter has been temporarily reassigned to Naval Air Forces in San Diego.

He hasn't commented publicly about the charges, but former subordinates - including woman - have spoken out in support of him.

The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946, making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world

'At one 
point there was a command survey and one came back that men didn't treat
 women fairly,' Melinda Cary, who served under McWherter during 2006 to 
2008, told The News Journal.

'The
 first thing he did was bring us to talk about who was telling jokes. 
And he went out, and, I guess, set them straight. He followed up and 
made sure we weren't still having trouble.'

McWherter served as commanding officer of the Blue Angels from November 2008 to November 2010, and then from May 2011 to November 2012.

During his second tour with the Blue Angels, McWherter received an award for his 'leadership and contributions' to the North American air show industry.

An Atlanta native and graduate of The Citadel, McWherter is an F/A-18 pilot with multiple tours in combat squadrons, including three deployments aboard the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, according to U-T San Diego.

He is a graduate of the Navy's Fighter Weapons School, known as Top Gun, and won the 2003 Commander Naval Air Forces Leadership Award. He was also VFA-131's Pilot of the Year in 1996.

The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946, making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world, after the French Patrouille de France formed in 1931.
