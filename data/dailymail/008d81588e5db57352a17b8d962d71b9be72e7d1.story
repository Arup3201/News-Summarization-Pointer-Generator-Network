A New York City mother died in the Catskills at the weekend after taking a strange fall from a ski lift.

Police say that 44-year-old Olga Filkin, of Brooklyn, was riding the lift at Hunter Mountain alone when the incident occurred on Sunday afternoon.

Filkin, described as a 'pretty good skier' and a regular at the resort, was on a trip with her husband and her daughter.

She was on the D Lift alone when the three-person seat began to rock, according to The Times Union. 

Scene: Mother-of-two Olga Filkin fell 25 feet from a ski lift at Hunter Mountain ski resort in the Catskills on Sunday, after one of her skis became caught in a cable support pole, dragging her under the restraining bar

Somehow, one of Filkin's skis became caught on one of the lift's cable support poles.

Even though the restraint bar was down at the time - according to the vice president of the ski resort - Filkin was dragged under the bar and fell to the ground below.

The mother-of-two fell 25 feet, according to NBC.

She was treated by medical personnel at the scene and in the resort's first aid room, but died soon after.

'All of us are devastated by this,' Hunter Mountain said in a statement. 

'We send our deepest sympathy to her family and friends.'

An autopsy performed Monday showed that the cause of death was from injuries consistent with the fall and accidental.

There were approximately 3,000 at the resort on Sunday. 

'Safety is a top priority for Hunter Mountain, and we have a wide variety of programs and protocols in place,' said Gerry Tschinkel, Hunter Mountain vice president of sales, marketing and sponsorships.

'These touch every aspect of our operations.'

'There are always going to be elements of risk involved in skiing and snowboarding, but our staff works hard to make sure that guests can enjoy the mountain as safely as possible.'
