Pictures have emerged of the dramatic moment Heidi Klum helped save her son and two nannies from a terrifying riptide over Easter.

The 39-year-old was relaxing in Hawaii on Sunday with her children and boyfriend Martin Kristen when  their holiday took a frightening turn for the worse.

The supermodel and her bodyguard lover were forced to rescue her seven-year-old son Henry and two of the family’s nannies when they got swept away in the ocean.

Photographs from the scene show her running towards to the water and dragging them from the surf to safety, moments after her boyfriend had pulled them from the waves.

Breaking into a run, the German-born star started to point frantically at the water.

Wasting no time her boyfriend and bodyguard immersed himself in the treacherous waves and began to pull Henry and the terrified looking nannies to safety.

It wasn’t long until Heidi herself was at the water’s edge and dove right in to get stuck in with the rescue.

First she grabbed her eldest son who 
was struggling to stay above the surf, while Martin and one of the 
nannies crawled back on to the sand, visibly gasping for breath.

Satisfied that Henry was safe, the blonde star jumped back into the water and swam to rescue the other nanny.

As she pulled the nanny out of the water, the woman looked exhausted and was struggling for air.

Once safe, Martin and the nannies lay on the beach taking the time to catch their breath once again.

At that point Heidi’s father, who was holidaying with them, joined to help the party.

Not quite finished with her rescue mission, Heidi ran to get water before her and her father administered the suffering party with the sips they needed.

Speaking about the incident in a statement to Us Weekly Heidi said: 'We got pulled into the ocean by a big wave. Of course, as a mother, I was very scared for my child and everyone else in the water.

'Henry is a strong swimmer and was able to swim back to land. We were able to get everyone out safely.'

Break: The nanny lies back on the sand delighted to be alive and well

Not finished yet: Once everyone is safe Heidi runs to get them some water

Concerned: After all the drama is over the model looks deeply upset and worried about those close to her

Heidi, was however a little concerned about the lack of support from other people on the beach, but she played down her role telling People magazine: 'These photos taken recently look much worse than it really was that day. I did what any mother would do.'

She continued: 'Henry swam out of it. I grabbed him at the shore. The nannies were the ones in much deeper trouble.'

The Project Runway host also had advice for other holidaymakers: 'Never underestimate the power of the ocean.'

Sip: Heidi brings water for Henry who is lying on the sand, while his little sister looks on

Back to his old self: It didn't take Henry long before he was running around the beach once again

Catching her breath: The family's nanny still seemed to be struggling with her breathing as she walked on the sand

Heidi, her bodyguard turned boyfriend Martin and her four children, Leni, eight, Henry, Johan, six, and Lou, three, had been holidaying in Honolulu for several days over the Easter break.

Earlier in the day on Sunday, Heidi had posted a snap of brightly coloured Easter eggs on the beach, writing 'Happy Easter' in an accompanying caption.

It appears that before the incident she had planned an Easter egg hunt for her clan.
