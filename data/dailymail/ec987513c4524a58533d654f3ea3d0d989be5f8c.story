Hatem Ben Arfa will be used by Newcastle United as a makeweight in their attempt to sign Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette.

The Magpies have been pursuing the 23-year-old striker all summer but have so far failed to reach an agreement with his club, while there has also been suggestion the player prefers Champions League football.

But sources in France say the two-times capped Lacazette could yet be open to a move to the Premier League and St James’ Park.

United have been encouraged by this and will offer Ben Arfa as bait.

He started his career at the Ligue 1 club before moving to Marseille and then Tyneside and the forward’s camp have indicated he would jump at the chance of a return.

Ben Arfa is training with the reserves at present after manager Alan Pardew criticised his ‘professionalism’ and it is thought there is no possibility of a reprieve.

Newcastle would have to pay a portion of the 27-year-old’s £50,000-per-week wages should he join Lyon on loan, while a fee of around £15million has been quoted for pacey frontman Lacazette, who scored 23 times last season.
