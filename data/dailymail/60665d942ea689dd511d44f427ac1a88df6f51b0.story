There aren't many teachers who actually encourage doodling.

And there are fewer who contribute to it, but John Zadrozny is a break in the education mould.

A former science instructor at a girls high school in Thailand, the 25-year-old started adding onto the drawings his students would do on their exam papers.

After a while he announced that any doodle would receive a doodle back from his signature red pen, but there's once crucial rule - they have to do the work first.

Dream teacher: John Zadrozny - or Mr. Z - was a new recruit at a girls high school in Thailand, but quickly managed to win over his students with his doodles

Funny: The 25-year-old told the students that if they left a doodle, he would leave one back

Raaah: Zadrozny would have fun with the drawings, and would try and do what the students wouldn't expect

'I should have studied': Zadrozny would take his red pen and try and be creative

Drawing has always been a hobby of mine, especially when I was in school,' Zadrozny told The Huffington Post.

'I've never been amazing at the technical side of it, so I loved doing things that made people laugh.

'I just had no idea so many people would like them!'

But they do.

Zadrozny has been putting the drawings up on a Tumblr site, which is getting hundreds of thousands of hits.

Of course, back in the classroom, he was a hit, with more and more tests having doodles of them, and more and more students excited to get the paper back.

'When you're inexperienced and new, you have to establish some pretty rigid discipline procedures,' Zadrozny told The HuffPost.

'This was a way for me to be strict inside the classroom, but still be able to interact with the students in a fun way outside of it.'

Zadrozny left teaching and now works in malaria research, but says he misses it.
