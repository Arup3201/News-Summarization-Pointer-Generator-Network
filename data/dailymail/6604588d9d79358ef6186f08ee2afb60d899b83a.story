Convicted child sex offender Warren Jeffs walked out of his sentencing hearing in protest today, telling the court there would be a 'whirlwind of judgement' on the world if God's 'humble servant' wasn't set free.

Polygamist cult leader Jeffs, 55, made the bizarre outburst after representing himself during the eight-day trial that ended with his conviction of sexual assault against two under age church members.

The news comes as shocking
pictures emerged showing Jeffs holding and passionately kissing an 
underage female church member.

And as the Texas court began today to consider punishment for Jeffs today, prosecutors told the jury to expect more sickening revelations, including the fact he had 24 underage 'wives'.

Other pictures revealed to the court today showed beds where ritual sex sessions were carried out in front of a church audience.

State witness Rebecca Musser - a former FLDS member - told the court she had received training about how beds in the temple were to be used in sexual rituals before it was built.

Miss Musser told the court beds inside the temple were arranged so that witnesses could see the abuse and that a special seat was placed for someone to record the sexual acts.

Also called to testify was Utah psychologist Larry Beall who described Jeffs' grooming of the underage girls as being 'like a peadophile'.

Mr Beall, who has worked with FLDS victims, said some of the abused girls may not even recognise they have been sexually assaulted - such was their 'mental conditioning'

He said: 'The adolescent girl in the FLDS community has no frame of reference to understand she is a victim.

'He [Jeffs] was an expert at taking average sounding words and making them sexual.'

Mr Beall then gave examples where Jeffs used phrases such as 'being ready' and 'heavenly sessions' to refer to sex.

At the start of today's punishment phase, and before jurors had even been brought back into court, Jeffs absented himself from events saying: 'I request the full removal of myself as an objection to all that has been presented.'

He asked to keep serving as his own attorney, but state District Judge Barbara Walther said he couldn't leave and continue to represent himself at the same time.

Instead, she ordered two lawyers who had been Jeffs' standby counsel, Deric Walpole and Emily Munoz Detoto, to represent him.

'Mr Jeffs, I know this is difficult for you to understand, but you do not have control over these proceedings,' Walther said.

Jeffs often stands in court and waits up to a full minute before speaking.

He began in slow and deliberate manner to respond, saying 'I am . . .,' but Walther ordered a recess.

Jeffs is the ecclesiastical head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. The more than 10,000 FLDS members nationwide see Jeffs as a prophet who is God's spokesman on Earth.

Jeffs asked to be taken back to jail, but Walther said that would make it too difficult for his lawyers to communicate with him.

Instead, he was placed in a room near the court and will be allowed to return to the hearing whenever he chooses.

The judge said Jeffs won't be able to dismiss his attorneys again and go back to defending himself, however.

He burned through a slate of seven high-powered attorneys, including Walpole and Detoto, in the six months before he decided to represent himself, and Walther said he did so in an effort to manipulate the court and stall the case against him.

Prosecutors plan to call witnesses 
during the sentencing hearing and introduce evidence showing Jeffs 
committed a slew of crimes not mentioned during his trial.

For
starters, Jeffs had 78 wives along with his legal spouse, and 24 of 
them were under age 17, said Eric Nichols, lead prosecutor for the Texas
Attorney General's office, which is handling the case.

Nichols
also said he would show that Jeffs committed six other sexual assaults 
and either witnessed or performed more than 500 polygamist marriages, as
well as 67 other sect marriages involving underage girls.

Jeffs
spent years evading arrest - criss-crossing the country as a fugitive 
who eventually made the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list before his capture in
2006, Nichols said, and he excommunicated 60 church members he saw as a
threat to his leadership, breaking up 300 families while stripping them
of property and 'reassigning' wives and children.

married to Jeffs' father Rulon, 83, the then-prophet, who died in
2002. She left the church shortly after his death when Warren tried to 
force her to remarry

All
of that is separate from the assaults on two girls, ages 12 and 15, 
that Jeffs was convicted of Thursday, after jurors deliberated for three
and a half hours.

Prosecutors
used DNA evidence to show Jeffs fathered a child with the older victim 
and played an audio recording of what they said was him sexually 
assaulting the younger one.

They
played other tapes in which Jeffs was heard instructing as many as a 
dozen of his young wives on how to please him sexually — and thus, he 
told them, please God.

After
Jeffs left the courtroom Friday, Nichols gave an opening statement, 
saying Jeffs was guilty of 'a breathtaking quantity of criminal 
activity' as head of the FLDS.

'The
defendant abused not only his position, but those religious views 
you've heard about as a means of satisfying his own personal greed, 
desires and appetites,' Nichols said.

Walpole
responded by saying Jeffs was raised in the church and couldn't betray 
his own religious tenets. Jeffs took over leadership of the FLDS from 
his father.

'He would rather go to prison than disagree with those beliefs,' Walpole said.

'He'd rather make a complete mess of this case.'

He later told jurors, 'you've shown you can be tough. Now it's time to show you can be fair.'
