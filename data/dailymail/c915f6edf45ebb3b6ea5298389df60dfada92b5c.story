David de Gea's girlfriend Edurne Garcia has backtracked over claims she said Manchester is 'not very nice', insisting that words were put into her mouth by the media.

Rumours of De Gea's exit from Manchester United were fuelled earlier this month when an interview with Garcia surfaced, in which she is alleged to have announced her dislike of the city.

'It's not very nice, that's for sure,' Garcia says in response to the presenter claiming 'Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge.'

'You have hunt out specific places, the nice places. But even then Spain is nicer.' 

But now, the singer, who will be representing Spain in this year's Eurovision Song Contest, has hit back at the reports, insisting that her words have been twisted.

'It was an incredible revolution but I didn't say that,' she told Chance. 'They put words in my mouth. I haven't said that.

'I don't know if they are seeking out the news or they want to be controversial, but it surprises me when I saw everywhere this sentence that I have never said. I am delighted with Manchester, I love it, and the city has wonderful corners.'

De Gea's United contract runs out at the end of next season, and there are rumours of a return to Madrid

Two days after the interview surfaced, Manchester City Council chief Pat Karney invited Garcia on a tour around the city, remarking 'the only thing Manchester has in common with a fridge is that it’s really cool' in an interview with Manchester Evening News.

Garcia admits she is happy to be shown around: 'There's a Councillor who wants to show me the city, and I am delighted to know more wonderful corners in Manchester. But I have never said that. The people could watch the video and see that they misrepresent the information.' 

De Gea's contract at Old Trafford runs out at the end of next season, but there have been strong rumours regarding Real Madrid's interest in bringing the goalkeeper back to the city he was born in.

Garcia's initial comments stoked the fire, but her most recent interview may provide some hope to Manchester United fans that they will keep hold of their star man beyond this season.

Garcia has since been offered a tour around Manchester by a Councillor, which she gratefully accepted
