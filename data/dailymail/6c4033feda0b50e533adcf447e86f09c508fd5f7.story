Beautiful photos have been released which capture the day three sisters got married at the same time so their dying mother could attend - just 12 hours before she passed away.

When Sarah, Kaylee and Jodie Swales - aged 19, 21 
and 22 - learned their mother's breast cancer had worsened, they agreed to hold a joint wedding on October 26 last year. They were already engaged.

But as Becky Swales' condition deteriorated, the loving daughters from Snellville, Georgia brought the ceremony forward to fulfill her final wish of seeing them walk down the aisle.

Bittersweet: Sisters Sarah, Kaylee and Jodie Swales married in a triple wedding as they wanted their mother, who had terminal cancer, to see them walk down the aisle. She passed away hours later

Incredibly moving: The Swales family was overwhelmed by the moving ceremony, with the women's father Otis comforting his wife Becky (both seated)

Together: The young women said their wedding just wouldn't be the same without their mother Becky, seated

Surrounded by friends and family, and with their mother Becky and father Otis in the front row, the sisters took turns to marry their fiances as the others watched.

Newly-released photos of the wedding, taken by Colors of Life Photograph, reveal how deeply moving the ceremonies were. 

'It's kind of bittersweet,' Jodie Swales told FOX5 before the ceremony.

'We are happy that she's here, but this will probably be the last big thing that we do with her.'

Sarah added: 'It's not like losing a mom, it's like losing a mom and a best friend 
and anyone would want their best friend at their wedding.

'Our wedding wouldn't be the same if she wasn't there to experience 
it with us.'

Kindhearted: The loving sisters had planned to marry on October 26 but as their mother's condition worsened, they decided to wed earlier to fulfill her final wish of seeing them walk down the aisle

Otis Swales, who walked all of his daughters down the aisle, said he was hoping his faith would get him through.

'My wife is the love of my life so it's hard,' said Otis, who had been married to Becky for 25 years. 'But I'm proud of my daughters. I just pray God gives me strength to get through every day.'

Just 12 hours after her daughters walked down the aisle, Becky Swales succumbed to the disease.

She had been diagnosed with breast cancer on February 15, 2010 and although chemotherapy proved effective at first, doctors discovered that the disease had spread to other organs.

Despite her bleak prognosis, Mrs Swales' daughters say she had continued to maintain a positive attitude until her death.

'She does always have a smile on her face and she's pushing so hard,' Kaylee said.

Before her death, Becky, 43, wrote on Facebook: 'I thank God for waking me up every day. I have such a great support system.

'My
 loving husband, my three beautiful daughters and my Mom have stood by 
me every step of the way. I can't say enough about what a blessing that 
has been.'

Throughout
 the wedding planning, support
 and donations had poured in for the family and a company even donated a
 venue for a reception.

The reception was held several days after Mrs Swales had passed away.
