A council spent a staggering £200,000 on a hunt for a notorious internet blogger known as ‘Mr Monkey’ after he insulted local councillors.

The anonymous writer referred to councillors as ‘Pudgy Face’, ‘Miss Piggy’, ‘King of Sleaze’ and ‘The Fat Mackem Hobbit’ as he promised to ‘expose the truth’ behind their alleged lies.

Despite the internet troll abandoning the blog in 2009, the north east council have only just called off the manhunt - having spent the last five years searching for him.

South Tyneside Council in Tyne and Wear launched the search after insisting it had a 'duty of care' to protect employees from malicious accusations made by a blogger known as 'Mr Monkey'

South Tyneside Council launched the search after insisting they had a ‘duty of care’ to protect their employees from malicious accusations made online.

They immediately hired Washington DC lawyers McDermott, Will and Emery, to try and trace those responsible - all funded by the public purse.

But after spending more than £214,000 on the search for Mr Monkey, town hall bosses have now decided to drop the hunt.

Last night the council investigation was branded a 'ludicrous' waste of money.

Andy Silvester, a spokesman for the Taxpayers Alliance, said: 'Pursuing this claim at the expense of hard-pressed taxpayers was ludicrous and the investigation has wasted thousands of pounds. Good sense has finally prevailed, but taxpayers have had to foot a massive bill in the meantime.'

The Mr Monkey blog first appeared in 2008 where defamatory comments were made about Council leader Iain Malcom, Labour colleague Cllr Anne Walsh, the late Tory and UKIP councillor David Potts and council regeneration boss Rick 0'Farrell.

In the blog – which at its prime was getting over 4,000 hits a day – Mr Monkey used nicknames for the workers as he went on to label them ‘f***wits’, ‘lazy’ and ‘scheming, lying, cheating and corrupt w******’.

The council suspected there was also a connection between several twitter accounts and 'Mr Monkey' and, as a result, the courts in California forced Twitter to hand over private account details of some of its users

Nicknames included Miss Piggy, Pudgy Face, Cleadon Plonky, Chuckle Brothers, Mammy's Boy’, King of Sleaze and The Fat Mackem Hobbit.

Mr Monkey’s aim was to ‘focus on political news and gossip in South Tyneside… and leave no stone unturned in an attempt to expose the truth’.

He accused some of the leaders of vote rigging, claiming expenses for ‘piss ups’, and documented their alleged drunken misadventures and dodgy affairs.

The blog also had a ‘T*** of the Week’, and detailed private information about the potential parliamentary candidates, as well as commenting on their fashion sense.

In 2009 he became aware of workers at the council trying to silence him, to which he responded: ‘It seems senior councillors and a handful of council officers have become so obsessed with Mr Monkey’s Blog that they’ll stop at nothing to close it down.’

The blogger alleged that council officers tried to censor the blog by barring access to it from council owned computers.

Employees of the council were said to have asked legal action to be taken against the anonymous blogger but Mr Monkey said the executive of the council originally refused this action, which left them feeling ‘angry’ and ‘frustrated’.

Mr Monkey added: ‘Imagine what the public would say about a council who spends hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers money chasing a monkey and all because the Chuckle Brothers can’t face the prospect of being labelled as a couple of scheming, lying, cheating and corrupt w******.’

Defamatory comments were made on the 'Mr Monkey' blog - which received about 4,000 visits a day, about council leader Iain Malcom (right) and UKIP councillor David Potts (left), as well as various other councillors

In July 2009, for exact reasons 
unknown, Mr Monkey said after causing ‘mayhem in the corridors of power’
 he would no longer be posting any new material on the blog.

He said he had spent months agonising over whether to retire, but had finally decided to spend more time with his family.

But despite no blog posts appearing on the site since, council bosses continued to spend taxpayers money on trying to find him.

At some point in 2009, the council instructed the American lawyers to try to find out those responsible, insisting it had a ‘duty of care’ towards its staff.

The firm produced an 18-page dossier in July 2011 which said Mr Monkey was most likely a two-man operation and that libel action would be ‘highly successful’ if pursued through the UK or US courts.

The case was taken to the US, because that is where WordPress, the online publishing platform for the blog, is based, and the council wanted to unmask the person behind the site.

'Pursuing this claim at the expense of 
hard-pressed taxpayers was ludicrous and the investigation has wasted 
thousands of pounds.'

The council suspected there was also a connection between several twitter accounts and Mr Monkey.

As a result, the courts in California ended up forcing Twitter to hand over private account details of some of its users - but it did not lead them to the mystery blogger.

On June 17, the council abandoned its legal action after a Freedom of Information request was submitted asking about the current bill. They wrote to the courts in the US and the case was dismissed.

A council spokesman said: ‘The council took legal action because it has a duty of care to protect its staff and officials from the kind of harassment and intimidation caused by this malicious and libellous blog, which, if left unchallenged, would have seriously damaged the reputations of innocent people.

‘Since the council initiated the action in 2009, the libellous comments have stopped and there have been no new postings on the blog.

‘Taking legal action attracted some criticism, but as a council we felt it was our duty to mount this challenge in order to protect people from cyber-bullying and harassment.

‘We stand by this principle.’
