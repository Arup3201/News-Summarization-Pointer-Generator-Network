The first alleged victim of two Los Angeles teachers, one who is accused of feeding his students his semen, and the other who abused two girls, spoke out Saturday.

The girl, who was in Mark Berndt’s second grade class in 2008, came home from school and showed her parents a picture of her eating a cookie with a gleaming, light-coloured substance visible.

She was transferred to Martin Springer’s class, where her father alleges Springer touched her on her leg and thigh.

On Saturday, the Los Angeles Times 
revealed that the two teachers at Miramonte Elementary School in 
inner-city Los Angeles knew each other and took school children on at 
least two field trips together.

The parents of the girl told the Los 
Angeles Times that they had chosen to forget the alleged incidences, 
until they saw that Berndt was charged with 23 acts of lewd conduct.

The Times reports that detectives 
have records that the girl transferred from one class to the next, 
according to a source familiar with the case.

‘As a parent, it’s very painful. I don’t want to know much more,’ the father told the Time.

Berndt, 61, is being held on $23 million bail.

At first, there was no known 
connection between Martin Springer, who was arrested Friday, and Mark 
Berndt, who was charged with feeding his alleged victims his own semen 
on a blue plastic spoon.

But
 now it has been revealed that the two schoolteachers knew each other 
and had taken their students on at least two joint field trips over the 
past decade, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The case has shocked the nation and 
thrown a chill into its second-largest school district, with 650,000 
students across hundreds of campuses.

Detectives interviewed Springer and 
the alleged victims on Thursday and had him under surveillance. He was 
arrested Friday as he exited a school district building in South Los 
Angeles, Parker said.

Detectives anticipate that more victims might come forward, he said.

A phone message left at Springer's home was not immediately returned.

Martin Springer was pulled from a 
classroom at Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles and arrested on 
suspicion of fondling two girls over a period of three years, an 
official said.

He will appear in court on Tuesday.

The
 arrest comes just days after Mark Berndt, a third-grade teacher at the 
same school was accused of photographed blindfolded, bound and gagged 
children, some of whom had giant cockroaches sitting on their faces and 
mouths.

Springer, who is from Alhambra, was arrested based on information that came forward after the first arrest was announced, Sheriff's Capt. Mike Parker said, but there was no known connection between the two cases.

The victims in the second case were about 7 years old and allegedly were fondled in a classroom, Parker said.

Springer was immediately removed and is expected to be fired next week,

Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy told KTTV.The number of complaints about teacher molestation has increased since news spread of the shocking allegations. 

Community shaken: Some parents have removed their children from Miramonte Elementary school where two teachers have now been arrested

Berndt, who worked at the school for 30 years, was removed from his position a year ago after a film processor alerted police to the disturbing photos.

He was arrested earlier this week and charged with committing lewd acts on 23 children, ages 6 to 10, between 2005 and 2010. He was jailed on $23 million bail and could face life in prison if convicted.

Meanwhile a lawyer has filed a claim against the Los Angeles school district saying he intends to file a lawsuit on behalf of an unidentified girl who ate a sugar cookie laced with the semen of the first teacher arrested, Mark Berndt.

Beverly Hills lawyer Raymond Boucher, whose Beverly Hills firm specializes in sexual abuse lawsuits against school districts, religious institutions and hospitals, said the legal claim of behalf of 'Jane Doe 1' charges that the district did not take adequate steps to prevent Berndt from repeatedly abusing children after they received complaints about him.

Parents have expressed fury that they
 were not told about the horrifying photographs a year ago, when 
Berndt’s was removed from the school.

Yesterday authorities acknowledged that a 10-year-old girl claimed Berndt tried to fondle her as far back as 1994.

Prosecutors declined to file to charges against Berndt in the 1993 report, saying they didn't have enough evidence.

Two other former pupils have come forward to say they reported strange behaviour by Berndt, in which the teacher allegedly moved his hand near his crotch under the desk, to a school councillor.

As news broke about the second arrest, some parents removed their children from class.

Ida Santana said her sister called her and told her to pick up her nephew.

'It's hard to leave our kids here,' Santana said. 'We can't trust the teachers no more. Now there's another teacher.'

Several other parents could be seen walking youngsters away from the school.

Santana said the family is unsure where the boy will be going to school from now on.

The case has also prompted the school district to fire a high school teacher who is being sued over allegations he had sex with students.

Vance Miller, 59, was pulled from his Hamilton High School classroom in 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported.

A police investigation didn't result in criminal charges. But two former students, now adults, said the music teacher had sex with them while they were students at Hamilton.
