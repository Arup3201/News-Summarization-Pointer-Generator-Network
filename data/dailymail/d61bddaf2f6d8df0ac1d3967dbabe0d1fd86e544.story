He is the fourth generation to work in his family’s building firm – and despite building his own home – he now runs the business in a management role.

The baker, who is favourite to win the show next week, is described in an article by his former school as a ‘keen fisher, diver and cyclist’.

‘He is teaching his daughters eco-friendly ways to help animals by building homes for hedgehogs to hibernate in,’ it adds.

According to his profile on the BBC website, he has his own allotment in his back garden and ‘volunteers for the National Wildlife Trust’.

The 38-year-old lives in a detached house in Mill Hill, north London - thought to be worth at least £600,000, according to the Daily Star.

He has also goes scuba diving, has holidayed in Marrakech, northwest Africa, and been skiing in the French alps.

Hitting back at claims on Twitter, his wife, Sarah Burr, wrote: ‘FWIW [for what it’s worth] @RichardPBurr rebuilt our home himself from derelict while doing BSc part0time. A #hero, a #legend & hardest working man alive.’

His wife of six years, Mrs Burr works for London's Cycle Strategy and also tweeted today after spotting several people using foldable Brompton bicycles at her nearby train station Mill Hill Broadway.

Mr Burr, who started baking as a child and was named the show’s star baker during the semi-final, is the bookmakers favourite with Ladbrokes setting the odds at 2-1.

Earlier this week, he said he felt he had demonstrated men were just as good as baking as women.

‘I hope we’ve turned over some stereotypes. Builders aren’t particularly known for their cooking abilities, but I think more fellas should bake,’ he said.

‘Bread’s easy, it’s only four ingredients, and even if you make it badly people are appreciative.’
