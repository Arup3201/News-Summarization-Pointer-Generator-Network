Scientists have identified a brain discovered last year as belonging to the world’s first predator.

The exquisitely preserved brain was found in a fossil of the creature that lived in the Lower Cambrian, around 520 million years ago.

The discovery reveals a brain that is surprisingly simple and less complex than those known from fossils of some of the animal’s prey.

Scientists have identified a fossil 520 million years old as a brain belonging to the world's earliest predator, known as Lyrarapax. On the left here can be seen neural structures in the head of the animal, including the brain. On the right is the fossil, a nearly complete specimen of the ancient predator

The find for the first time identifies the fossilised brain of what are considered the top predators of their time, a group of animals known as anomalocaridids, which translates to 'abnormal shrimp.'

The fossil of the world's earliest predator, named Lyrarapax, was found in 2013 near Kunming in the Chinese province of Yunnan.

It is what is known as an anomalocaridid, which translates as an 'abnormal shrimp'.

Just over five inches (13 centimetres) long, Lyrarapax was dwarfed by some of the larger anomalocaridids, which reached more than three feet (one metre) in length.

Paleontologists excavating lower Cambrian rocks in southern Australia found that some anomalocaridids had huge compound eyes, up to 10 times larger than the biggest dragonfly eye, meaning they were probably highly efficient hunters.

Long extinct, these fierce-looking arthropods were first discovered as fossils in the late 19th century but not properly identified until the early 1980s.

They still have scientists arguing over where they belong in the tree of life.

‘Our discovery helps to clarify this debate,’ said Professor Nicholas Strausfeld, director of the University of Arizona's Center for Insect Science and senior author of the paper about the findings.

‘It turns out the top predator of the Cambrian had a brain that was much less complex than that of some of its possible prey and that looked surprisingly similar to a modern group of rather modest worm-like animals.’

The new species has been given the name Lyrarapax unguispinus - Latin for 'piny-clawed lyre-shaped predator’.

The brain suggests it is related to a branch of animals whose living descendants are known as onychophorans or velvet worms.

These wormlike animals are equipped with stubby unjointed legs that end in a pair of tiny claws.

This artist's impression of Lyararapax, one of the species of the world's first predators, the anomalocaridids, shows it chasing its possible prey, primitive fish that also existed in the Lower Cambrian 520 million years ago. The creature was likely about five inches (13 centimetres) long

Velvet worms, which are also exclusively predators, grow to no more than a few inches in length and are mostly found in the Southern Hemisphere, where they roam the undergrowth and leaf litter in search of beetles and other small insects, their preferred prey.

Two long feelers extend from the head, attached in front of a pair of small eyes.

The anomalocaridid fossil resembles the anatomy of today's velvet worms in several ways, according to Strausfeld and his collaborators.

The worms have a simple brain located in front of the mouth and a pair of ganglia - a collection of nerve cells - located in the front of the optic nerve and at the base of their long feelers.

‘And - surprise, surprise - that is what we also found in our fossil,’ Strausfeld said, pointing out that anomalocaridids had a pair of clawlike grasping appendages in front of the eyes.

‘These top predators in the Cambrian are defined by just their single pair of appendages, wicked-looking graspers, extending out from the front of their head.

‘These are totally different from the antennae of insects and crustaceans.

‘Such frontally disposed appendages are not found in any other living animals with the exception of velvet worms.’

The similarities of their brains and other attributes suggest that the anomalocaridid predators could have been very distant relatives of today's velvet worms.'

The ancient predator is believed to have a similar neuro-anatomy to modern velvet worms (pictured), which are also exclusively predators, grow to no more than a few inches in length and are mostly found in the Southern Hemisphere, where they roam the undergrowth and leaf litter in search of prey

This drawing shows the flattened, fossilised trace of the brain of the ancient predator. The X-like structure in the head denotes the fossilised brain. Two dark round spots represent the optic ganglia with nerves that lead from the eyestalks into the head, while the main brain region is in front of the mouth

Xiaoya Ma of the Natural History Museum in London, a co-author on the paper, added: ‘This is another contribution towards the new field of research we call neuropaleontology.

'These grasping appendages are a characteristic feature of this most celebrated Cambrian animal group, whose affinity with living animals has troubled evolutionary scientists for almost a century.'

Ma continued that the discovery of the preserved brain helps to clarify similarities with the modern velvet worms.

'Being able to directly associate appendages with parts of the brain in Cambrian animals is a huge advantage,' said co-author Gregory Edgecombe, also at the Natural History Museum.

'For many years now paleontologists have struggled with the question of how different kinds of appendages in Cambrian fossils line up with each other and with what we see in living arthropods.

'Now for the first time, we didn't have to rely just on the external form of the appendages and their sequence in the head to try and sort out segmental identities, but we can draw on the same tool kit we use for extant arthropods - the brain.'

And the incredibly well preserved brain shows how the species is a distant relative of animals alive today called velvet worms
