Runaway teacher Jeremy Forrest told a 14-year-old schoolgirl ‘I love you’, days before kissing her in his classroom, a court heard yesterday.

A few weeks later, the married 30-year-old had sex with her at his cottage while his wife was away.

He also researched the maximum jail sentence he could get for sleeping with his pupil, Lewes Crown Court was told.

Teacher in the dock: Jeremy Forrest's 15-year-old pupil, giving evidence by videolink, described how their relationship had developed from a kiss in the classroom to sex at the cottage he shared with his wife

When he realised the affair was about 
to be exposed he fled to France with his lover and spent eight days on 
the run before being caught and returned to Britain, the jury heard.

A filmed police interview with the schoolgirl soon after they were found last September was played to the court yesterday.

In it, the teenager described how 
after becoming close during a school trip to the US last February they 
began exchanging frequent Twitter and text messages, which gradually 
became more flirtatious.

She said late in April 2012 he sent her a message on Twitter saying: ‘I’ve got something to tell you tomorrow.’

Educational establishment: In the days leading up to the kiss, the teenager said she attended Bishop Bell Church of England School (pictured) in Eastbourne, East Sussex, early - specifically to see him

The schoolgirl added: ‘I went into 
school early in the morning. He just said he was in love with me. I said
the feeling is the same. That’s when things became serious.’

She described turning up early to school for four consecutive days in May until there was a time when they could be alone.

Asked about their first kiss, she 
said: ‘I do remember one day being in his classroom, it was just me and 
him and he said, “I really want to kiss you”, and I said, “I really want
to kiss you too”, because that’s what I wanted.

‘It got to the point where there was only so much of a friendship you could have before it developed into something else.

On trial: The girl was 14 at the time of the alleged kiss with 30-year-old Jeremy Forrest (pictured today outside Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex)

‘It ended up being in his classroom.’

Shortly after she turned 15, the maths teacher took her to his house in Ringmer, East Sussex, while his wife, Emily, was away.

She said he showed her around the house, including the marital bedroom, before cooking her dinner.

They watched TV together and spent the night side by side in the spare bedroom, but not having sex, the court heard.

They continued to meet outside school 
and exchange more intimate texts and photos, including one of her 
dressed in just her underwear and a hooded top, the court heard.

She said: ‘It got to the point where kissing each other like that, it became not enough.’

The youngster returned to Forrest’s 
home in July last year, while Mrs Forrest was seeing her parents, and 
this time they had sex for the first time, she said.

She had told her 
mother she was seeing a friend when it happened.

The schoolgirl said: ‘The whole thing was pretty quick. When it came to it, I don’t think we spoke that much about it.

‘I remember after not feeling guilty 
or that I had done anything wrong. We used contraception every single 
time. Obviously it was a big thing for me. It should probably have been 
bigger, but I was not that affected by it.’

She added that Forrest seemed nervous about having sex, but ‘after having sex for the first time there was pressure off’.

They continued to have sex at his 
home, in local hotels and in his Ford Fiesta and also went on day trips 
to the Bluewater shopping centre near the M25 in Kent and Hastings in 
East Sussex.

She said ‘He wanted me to meet his parents. I think they’d seen a picture of me.’

On one occasion, she said Forrest told
her his wife had become angry after discovering the youngster’s nail 
varnish at the marital home.

She said Forrest had previously said he and his wife had split up.

He then told her how Mrs Forrest 
reacted when she found the cosmetics, she said, adding: ‘She was angry, 
because they had split up but they were still married, and that’s when 
he told her he was seeing someone else.

‘The fact that he has a wife has 
always been a problem for me. I was like, “Why are you with me?” You’re 
meant to be in love with the person you marry.’

Pupils anger

The couple discussed their age gap and
the fact that he was a teacher, but to her it was never a major 
concern, she said, adding: ‘I have never felt what me and Jeremy have 
done was wrong, it feels so right.

‘I can understand why it’s wrong 
because of the law but it didn’t feel wrong. To him, it wasn’t about age
and it didn’t matter to him what age I was because he just liked me as a
person. It didn’t worry me because we were in love. We still are.

‘If he was caught he could lose his 
job and we would be separated from each other. It was an issue, but 
something we knew in a few years wouldn’t be.

‘Because I’m 15 people think I don’t know what’s going through my head. I know my own mind, I know what I want.’

Forrest was also aware of the 
consequences he faced and even looked up how long he could be jailed for
having sex with an underage pupil, she added.

‘Obviously he knew what could happen, losing his job and getting into trouble. That was just a risk he wanted to take.’

She said they would have minor rows about classmates talking to her or texting her because they thought she was single.

Their secret relationship came to light after the police were tipped off and confiscated her phone, the court heard.

Forrest picked up the schoolgirl the 
following evening and they drove to Dover to catch a ferry, it was 
alleged. She said: ‘I think he was panicking a lot, just the look on his
face.

‘He looked very anxious, very worried 
and frustrated in a way because we knew we were going to be caught for 
something that we didn’t think was wrong.’

On the ferry Forrest threw his phone 
into the sea to prevent them being traced. They later drove to Paris 
where they dumped their car before taking a train to Bordeaux where 
Forrest began to relax.

The schoolgirl said they did not watch
TV and had ‘no idea how big the story of their disappearance had become
in Britain’. She said: ‘It was more of a jokey thing, saying, “Will we 
be on the news?”.’

But after spotting an online story 
about them as he was checking football results on his local paper, he 
began to panic again. ‘He said, “I’m going to go to prison. We are going
to be caught. I’m never going to see you again”,’ she said.

‘I had to reassure him a lot that everything was going to be fine.

‘He was just really worried that his family would disown him.’

Forrest was finally caught by local police after eight days on the run.

Hearing: Lewes Crown Court (file picture) heard that police were alerted to the relationship after a tip-off

She said: ‘I was trying to break free 
but he just stood there like it was expected. I mouthed “I love you” to 
him and he mouthed it back.’

She saw him one last time as they were
driven away in separate cars from the police station after giving their
statements to French police.

She said: ‘His face was just blank. He had no expression.’

Forrest denies one count of child abduction. The trial continues.
