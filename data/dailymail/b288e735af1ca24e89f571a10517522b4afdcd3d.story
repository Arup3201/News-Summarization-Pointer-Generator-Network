It's the part they all want to play - the role of tennis star Andy Murray in a smash movie about his life.

You need to have incredible athleticism, nerves of steel and the simmering passion of Braveheart. So did rapper Pharrell Williams or 76-year-old entertainer Sir Terry Wogan have what it takes to play the lead?

And did pop star Britney Spears have the poise to play Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, seen leading the Scot's fan club at every tournament around the world?

Rapper Pharrell Williams features in the teaser trailer video auditioning for the part of Andy Murray in a Channel 4 movie about the tennis star's life as part of their Stand Up To Cancer fundraising efforts
