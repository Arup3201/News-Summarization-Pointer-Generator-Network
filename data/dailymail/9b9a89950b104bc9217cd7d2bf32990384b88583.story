A 15-year-old Iranian girl has been transported from Nauru to Sydney after drinking washing liquid in violent protests at the refugee compound.

Demonstrations have been staged at the  South Pacific island nation  in response to the contentious Cambodia asylum seeker deal which Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Cambodia's Minister of Interior Sar Kheng signed on Friday.

While the agreement is mostly shrouded in secrecy, it has been revealed there will be no limits placed on how many refugees can be sent.

A spokesman for the Refugee Action Collective with Ian Rintoul told Daily Mail Australia 'There have been three days of intense protests arising from the ill-considered deal.'

'The protests have been met with a savage response from the local police as well as the detention centre securities.'

'There have been a number of suicide attempts from the refugees. One of these is a 15–year-old Iranian girl, who drunk washing powder on Thursday. She has been medivaced to a Sydney hospital for medical treatment.'

'We see the news and they say about the refugees, people in Nauru will go to Cambodia. People here in Nauru, they all be shocked. Nobody happy. Everybody here today make protests.They not happy. They say it's not fair.'

'We hear that  there's many fighting in Cambodia. Also it's a very poor country. It's more poor than Nauru. How we can stay there? 

'Camps here in Nauru, it's very hard. Nobody can stay. No kids can stay here. Pregnant ladies, babies: how can they stay here?rotest. They not happy. They say it's not fair. They don't want to go to Cambodia.'

A spokesperson for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail 'The government can confirm that a 15 year old girl was transferred to Australia from Nauru on 26 September for medical treatment.

'A family member has accompanied her to Australia.

'The girl is currently in Australia receiving medical treatment.

'It is long standing government practice not to confirm or comment on reports of individual acts of self-harm.'

'The Minister has been advised that the department is aware that some transferees are engaging in peaceful protest activity in Nauru, and is working with its service providers to ensure the continued safety and good order of the facility.'

Morrison's agreement has been widely criticised, largely due to Cambodia being a poverty-stricken nation.

The plan has been condemned by Cambodia's opposition group, who said the Australian money from the deal would be corruptly spent by Cambodia's ruling party.

Human rights and aid groups in Cambodia have called the deal disgraceful, since the country has a terrible record for protecting refugees. 

There have also been significant protests outside the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 

Hundreds gathered there to demand Australia renounces the agreement. On Friday, One protester was knocked over by riot police and escorted from the rally bleeding from the head.
