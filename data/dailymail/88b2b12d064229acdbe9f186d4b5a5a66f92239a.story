From shooting hoops to eating lunch and from marching bands to disco dancing, these extraordinary photographs capture a bygone era in US education.

The amazing images of Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan, from detroiturbex.com combine old pictures of school life with recent views of the abandoned building.

Cass Tech, which counts singer Diana Ross and rocker Jack White among its alumni, moved to a new building in 2005 which left the original facility empty.

Shooting hoops: A 1988 basketball game superimposed over the abandoned condition of the old gymnasium at Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan

Walking along: The second-floor hallway at Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan, is pictured, with the images of old life merged with its abandoned state

Study time: The library, from a picture in a yearbook from the early Nineties, of Cass Technical High School. All books appear to have been removed from the old building

The White Stripes vocalist White learned to play the marimba at the school and said attending there was like ‘going to Harvard or something’.

The new Cass Tech building opened in 2005 to replace the school’s nearly century-old 830,000 sq ft building, which was demolished last year.

The original school was founded in 1907 and was named after Lewis Cass, who was the Michigan territory governor from 1813 to 1831.

Working hard: This room suffered especially badly after the Cass Technical High School building was abandoned. A photocopier can be seen on the right

Eerie: Paint peeled off the walls of a classroom after it was abandoned, where a teacher is seen helping a student with her work in this photo from days gone by

Chatting: The arts mural on floor three of Cass Technical High School is pictured in 1988 as students take out books from their lockers for lessons

By 1942 Cass Tech was the largest 
school in the state with 4,200 students attending the eight-storey brick
and limestone building.

A 
new addition to the building designed by Kahn & Associates was then 
added in 1985 onto the west side of the original structure.

The old building suffered vandalism after it was closed and was plagued by fires including one in 2007 that injured two firemen and two policemen.

‘I played marimba on one of my albums, and I learned how to play marimba in a class at that school,’ White told National Public Radio last year.

Further reading: Display cases and books are seen outside the auditorium on the third floor of Cass Technical High School, where light fittings were later ripped out

Time to dance: This photo of students stretching in a gymnasium shows how the school was left in complete ruin after the pupils moved out in 2005

Empty chairs and tables: The former book store is pictured in a photo which has been so well combined that it is difficult to see where the old ends and the new begins

‘Going to school there at age 14 was 
like all of sudden you were going to Harvard or something. It seemed 
like you were going to college.’

There
was much criticism by alumni of the decision to demolish Cass Tech, but
Detroit Public Schools said at the time it had no choice but to rip it down.

‘Our
kids have to walk past it every day,’ a spokesman said. ‘We've got it 
constantly being vandalised, constantly being broken into. It's a safety
issue.’
