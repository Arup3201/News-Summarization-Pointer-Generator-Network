My aim heading to Germany was firstly to extend my lead in the championship over Lewis Hamilton, and then win what is my second home race after Monaco, so it was very special to win for myself and for Mercedes as it is one of the most important grands prix on the calendar for the team.

Almost the entire Mercedes-Benz board was there, and after all the difficult times we went through as Mercedes in the first couple of years of the team, it was important to send out a good message.

It was a picture perfect weekend for me, but not for the whole team given the problems we suffered on the other car. But for me I had no such worries, securing pole position and then winning the race.

It was really very emotional and it was great with all the support from the home fans.

It was also nice that World Cup winner and Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski came to watch the race with our CEO Dr. Zetsche in the garage and to support me just as I had cheered him on him when he was representing Germany in Brazil, so that was really very cool.

Given Lewis's brake failure in qualifying and subsequent crash, I knew it would be an easier race, but I didn't prepare any differently.

I would have got more pleasure out of the victory if it would have been a gloves-off battle with my team-mate, but of course it was a very special win nevertheless, so heading into this weekend's race in Hungary I am very happy.

After the win in Hockenheim, I celebrated with the team afterwards, and there was some really hilarious stuff going on. We were dancing together in the garage so that was a lot of fun, but with back-to-back races, there hasn't been a lot of time to take in the victory.

As we headed away from the circuit in our car some fans pulled alongside us on the motorway, and they were going crazy. They slid open their van door and started singing 'this is a winner, this is a winner.'

We took a video of their chanting, and its awesome to see how much fun they get out of me winning, being a German driver in a German car in Germany. A lot of people were really excited about it so it was great to witness that enthusiasm first hand.

Unfortunately
 the number of fans who attended the German Grand Prix was down on 
recent years, and my impression was that people's racing enthusiasm has 
decreased because of what has happened to Michael Schumacher.

Hockenheim
 was a place where Michael had so much success and I think all the 
spectators have been hit by what has happened to him, and the condition 
he is now in. I think that has maybe taken some excitement away from 
racing. Obviously, we all still hope Michael makes as good a recovery as
 he can.

Ahead of the race there was lot of drama over the crash helmet we designed to celebrate Germany winning the World Cup.

I had planned to put the World Cup trophy on the top of my lid, but I got a call from football's governing body FIFA to say that it was not allowed and that I must remove it because it is a trademark.

Change: Nico Rosberg wasn't allowed to carry an image of the World Cup on his helmet for the race

Losing ground: Hamilton is now 14 points behind his Mercedes team-mate in the standings

Trouble behind: Rosberg leads the way as Massa crashes at the first corner

That was bit of a weird one. I removed it however, and everything was OK but it is incredible all the things that you have to think of. We never even took that into consideration when we designed the helmet!

We quickly changed the concept and replaced the trophy with four stars to represent each of Germany's World Cup successes. This weekend I am deciding which helmet to run - whether it is the one I wore to victory in Germany or my usual one - so, I have asked the fans on Facebook to vote. Let me know what one you think I should wear at the Hungaroring.

I go into this weekend's race very confident because I have a great car. I know that every track we go to, if I deliver I have the chance of being on pole and winning the race, and it does not get any better than that.

These are exciting times, ones that I can share with the team, and are well deserved. We went through some tough periods, but now we are getting the success we deserve which is nice to see. I look forward to the remainder of the season.

Toto Wolff made some comments earlier this week that it would be unfair if the championship was won at the last race as a result of the new double points system.

The concept is really artificial, I don't like it and that is a pity, but that is the way it is and we have got to accept it. Winning is winning, and obviously I will be happy if I win this year's championship whatever the circumstances.

Accident: Mercedes GP Executive Director Toto Wolff (right) was involved in a cycling shunt

Talking of Toto, he will be in the garage this weekend despite what happened earlier this week. He and a number of the team were involved in a cycling shunt on the River Danube during a team building event.

I did not take part, so I wasn't there, and I only joined up with the team for the dinner afterwards but it was a pretty big incident and a few guys were hurt.

Toto suffered broken bones but, by the time I had arrived for dinner in the evening, there was already a lot of banter flying about, jokes were being made about the crash, and a lot of people were laughing about it, so that was nice to see as it shows how tight we are as a team.

After this race, we head into the summer break; a four-week period before the next grand prix at the end of August in Belgium, which I will spend with friends, family and I plan to go to Ibiza.

But before that, on Thursday night, I hosted a team BBQ where I invited all my mechanics out here in Hungary. They work their butt off for me so it is really important to spend some private time together.

Happy: The German Grand Prix winner hosted a BBQ with his friends and mechanics in Hungary
