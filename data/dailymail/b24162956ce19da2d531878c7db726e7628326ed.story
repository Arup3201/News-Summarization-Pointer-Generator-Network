The row over the cost of Britain’s police commissioners grew last night after a Mail on Sunday investigation found that more than a dozen of them have appointed deputies on wages  of up to £68,000.

Just weeks after the £75 million vote  that saw a record low turnout for  a national election, a third of the crime chiefs are giving jobs to councillors, magistrates and former police officers to help them in their roles.

Some are being paid £68,000 a year – more than backbench MPs earn and almost enough to pay for three constables, who start on £23,500.

Third paid role: Yvonne Mosquito, left, will be paid £65,000 for a 32-hour working week by West Midlands PCC Bob Jones, right, and continue to receive £27,000 for two other council jobs

The new unelected jobs are being created even though police and crime commissioners (PCCs) have offices full of staff from the Police Authorities they replaced.

They do not have to advertise the posts and many have handed them to friends and political allies.

It has raised concerns that the PCCs, who themselves earn up to £100,000  a year, are not as accountable as they were meant to be – and are wasting cash that could be spent on frontline services to catch criminals.

Tory pals: David Carroll, right, will be paid £35,000 for a 22-hour week, serving under new Thames Valley PCC Anthony Stansfeld - both of whom sat on the old authority

Sam Chapman, editor of the Top  Of 
The Cops blog on PCCs, warned: ‘If commissioners use taxpayers’ money to
 put their mates in cushy jobs no one else can apply for, they risk 
damaging public confidence.’

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘Elected police 
commissioners were meant to cut out the expense and unelected 
bureaucracy  of Police Authorities.

‘Taxpayers
 will be deeply depressed to see that they appear keen on appointing 
more bureaucrats.

Thankfully,  voters will get the chance to vote out 
candidates who appear more keen  on building empires than dealing with 
local policing priorities.’

Business ally: Brian Ashton, left was chosen by Cambridge's new PCC and his Tory Party colleague Sir Graham Bright, right,

New deputy commissioners include:

Meanwhile, Adam Simmonds in Northamptonshire has appointed four ‘assistant commissioners’ – using a title given to senior officers in Scotland Yard – on £65,000 each, including his election agent, an established Tory activist called Kathryn Buckle.

Extra help: Northant's new PCC Adam Simmonds with Kathryn Buckle, one of four assistants each on £65,000

The highest paid deputy is former policeman Mark Dennett, on £68,000 as assistant to Vera Baird in Northumbria.

In total, 16 of the 41 PCCs in England and Wales told The Mail on Sunday they will appoint deputies, on salaries totalling at least £468,000.

PCCs, who set budgets and priorities, have just one pot of money to spend on their own offices and the force they govern, totalling almost  £8 billion a year nationwide. The more they spend on their staff, the less they will have for frontline police.

All 41 PCCs will meet for the first time tomorrow when they travel  to the Home Office to see Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Damian Green, the Policing Minister.

Many will call for changes to their budgets, as forces have been told  to make savings of £2.4 billion  by 2015.

Yvonne Mosquito, a Labour councillor who will be paid £65,000 for a 32-hour working week by West Midlands PCC Bob Jones. He wrote that he chose her as she is a ‘black female’ who has the ‘empathy and emotional  intelligence’ to complement his business skills. She will continue to receive £27,000 for two council roles.

Brian Ashton, ex-Mayor of Ely, who will get £28,000 for two to three days  a week in Cambridgeshire. Sir Graham Bright, the PCC, said his Tory Party colleague was a businessman who had experience of local government.

David Carroll, who will be paid £35,000 to work 22 hours a week  in Thames Valley. He sat with the PCC, Anthony Stansfeld, on the area’s old Police Authority committee and, like him, is a Tory councillor.
