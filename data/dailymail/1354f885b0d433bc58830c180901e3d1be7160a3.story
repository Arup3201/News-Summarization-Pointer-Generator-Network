Tesco bosses were left red-faced yesterday after they mistakenly advertised an £85 bicycle for £1 - and were predictably deluged with orders.

The store unintentionally posted a picture of a men's six-gear Terrain Brecon hybrid bike on its website at a huge 99 per cent discount.

As news spread of the deal, customers rushed to snap up the bargain, causing the site to crash.

Huge bargain: Tesco Direct advertised a six-gear Terrain Brecon men's hybrid bike for just £1 instead of £84.99 - a 99 per cent discount

Many even tried to buy in bulk, hoping to sell on the discounted £84.99 bicycle and make a profit.

The subject quickly started trending on Twitter, with many calling it the best deal ever.

The too-good-to-be-true deal offered the brand new 17kg steel bike with 24-inch wheels for the price of a lottery ticket.

Excited customer Sian Bradley said: 'Looking for a cheap mountain bike - Tesco direct selling them for one pound.'

Another, Rupert Murray, said: 'Tesco’s website has crashed after they advertised one pound bikes. I tried to buy 50 and was rejected.'

IT glitch: The supermarket giant is known for its cut-price deals - but this one was sadly too good to be true

Bargain hunters website HotUKDeals the price was being hailed the ‘best deal ever.’

One member, Sambrat, said: 'Ordered one and splashed out on next day delivery - lol.'

Another, 5reds, added: 'Just ordered 99 to sell on eBay lol.'

Unfortunately for those who believed it 
to be a genuine offer, Tesco soon pointed out the price had been a 
mistake and refused to honour the advertised deal.

Today a spokesman apologised to those who had been affected, blaming the mistake on an IT glitch.

'We apologise sincerely to affected customers for any inconvenience caused,' he said.

'Unfortunately this was an IT error, which has now been corrected.'

Not much of a bargain:
Tesco in Bridlington, East 
Yorkshire, was selling a bottle of water for 25p or two for 70p earlier this week

The item remained listed on Tesco Direct until late yesterday, but the usual ‘Add to basket’ option was replaced with a 
message reading, ‘there are currently no sellers for this product.’

It is not the first time the supermarket giant has caused a stampede with an unplanned bargain.

Last year the store caused a sensation 
when a pricing error saw Terry’s Chocolate Orange sold for just 29p -
down from £2.75.

Hundreds rushed to their local branch to buy trolleys full of the discounted confectionery.

One shopper was even reported to have purchased 192 of the chocolates - saving a staggering £471.

But the supermarket's miscalculated deals are not always so enticing.

Just two days ago, a branch in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, advertised a bottle of Harrogate Spa Spring Water at 25p, or two for 70p - more than double the price of just one.
