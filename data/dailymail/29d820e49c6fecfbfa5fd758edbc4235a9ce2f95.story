A failed engine on a Delta jet carrying 102 passengers prompted
an emergency landing in Syracuse, New York late Wednesday morning.

The pilot of flight 1430 from Detroit to Hartford, Connecticut reported one of its two engines not working in midair though details to its failure weren't immediately available.

'The aircraft landed safely, all 102 passengers were taken off the aircraft,' Syracuse Department of Aviation Commissioner Christina Callahan told MailOnline.

Emergency: A Delta passenger jet made an emergency landing in Syracuse, New York on Wednesday after one of its engines failed between Detroit and its final destination in Connecticut

The MD-80 made its landing around 11.20am at Syracuse Hancock International Airport.

Ms Callahan projected affected passengers being shuttled by bus or another aircraft to meet their final destination.

In the end, a described 'plane without wings' was the end ticket for those stranded according to claimed Delta passenger Brian Gardner who glumly Tweeted his travel's progress.

'Left engine went out in air; emergency landing in Syracuse. Waiting to hear what @delta is going to do to get us to Hartford,' he wrote.

Evacuated: All 102 passengers were safely removed from the Delta flight and said to have been moved onto a bus for the remainder of their journey (file photo)

Travel ahead: Expecting to continue the remainder of their journey by bus, one disgruntled passenger Tweeted this photo before what he estimated would be a 4.5 hour drive

Later replying to news of a charter bus picking up the remainder of his journey appeared to do little for the worn customer.

'Not sure how @delta sees a bus (4.5 hour drive according to maps app) as an acceptable alternative to an airplane. GET ANOTHER PLANE HERE,' he added, along with a photo.

A request for comment from Delta was not immediately returned.
