Wilfried Zaha started the season hoping to become a Manchester United and England regular, but finished out of favour with both.

Maybe that’s why he looks so unhappy, despite standing next to a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.

The 21-year-old posted the picture to his Instagram account on Tuesday, after a season of promise turned sour for the winger.

Zaha moved to Old Trafford in January 2013 for a deal worth £15million from Crystal Palace before being loaned back to Selhurst Park where he helped the club secure promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2012/13 campaign.

The England international was expected to prove a hit under then United boss David Moyes last season, but after starting in the Red Devils' 2-0 Community Shield win against Wigan at Wembley in August he would feature only three more times by the turn of the year.

Frozen out at Old Trafford, Zaha joined Cardiff on-loan in January but was unable to help the Welsh outfit avoid relegation.

The 2012/13 Championship Player of the Year will be hoping for an upturn in form and selection under new United manager Louis van Gaal that could merit him a place back in Roy Hodgson's England squad after being left out of his World Cup plans.
