A woman has claimed that she was forced to strip naked at gunpoint when Department of Homeland Security officials inexplicably raided her Florida home at dawn - and left with nothing.

Kari Edwards posted surveillance footage on YouTube that she claims shows the 6am raid on her house in Homestead on June 10, as well as images showing the officers inflicted on her property.

She says the footage shows a SWAT team swooping in as a helicopter hovered overhead, before they smashed in her front door and deafened her cat with smoke grenades.

The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to MailOnline's requests for comment.

Raid: Officers and an armored vehicle can be seen outside Kari Edwards' home in Homestead, Florida earlier this month. She claims that agents burst in and made her sit in handcuffs naked

Swoop: Agents, seen in light after dawn, did not seize anything from the property, Edwards said

On the video she posted to her YouTube page, Edwards said she and her boyfriend were inside the home when the SWAT team burst in at 6.16am.

'Armed men... demanded that I drop the towel I was covering my naked body with before snatching it off of me physically and throwing me to the ground,' she wrote. 'According to my boyfriend, the agent with his assault rifle to my back kept eying me up and down like I was eye candy.'

Edwards, who said she had previously worked for the DHS but has been disabled since 2006, recognized some of the agents as working for the federal agency and asked them for ID.

'The agent pointed at his uniform that read POLICE and said "Isn't this ID enough for you?",' she wrote. 'When I told him I could buy that up in Miami he called me retarded and said I was f***ing stupid.'

Damage: She shared a photo showing burn marks from a flash bang grenade on tiles that need replacing

Destruction: She also shared an image of belongings that had been thrown about in the bedrooms

Broken: She claimed that the agents also smashed her shower door and said she had no idea why

Smashed: She said that they also broke a sculpture outside, left, and the lock to their front door, right

She added to PoliceStateUSA.com that she saw 'ICE', 'Gang Task Force' and 'Special Agent' on the men's shirts.

She said that she was put in handcuffs that were so tight 'I could not feel my hands' and said that agents refused to cover her body, even though she repeatedly asked.

The video is about 20 minutes long, but she claimed that the raid went on for two hours.

'My boyfriend, who is asthmatic, started having trouble breathing due to the lingering smoke created by the flash bang grenade,' she said, and agents helped him find his inhaler.

The team eventually handed her a warrant signed by Jonathan Goodman, a federal magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, she said.

Claims: Kari Edwards said she still has not had answers from authorities about why they were raided

The warrant authorized the agents to search for computers and electronics - with the agents suggesting it was for child pornography - but Edwards said they did not seize any items.

Images 
shared on Facebook shows burn marks on the ground of her home from the grenade, as well as 
damaged door frames, smashed shower doors and even a smashed sculpture.

Edwards said the incident was 'two hours of pure hell' and she has filed complaints with authorities.

'After filing complaints with the FBI, DHS-OIG, ACLU and the White House as well as calling the chambers of Judge Jonathan Goodman, I still have no answers as of yet,' she wrote on Facebook.
