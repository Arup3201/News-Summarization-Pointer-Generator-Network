Naked: Suspected teenage drink-driver Joseph Michael Hall said he had taken the Bobcat to hide his nudity

A suspected drunk driver who was arrested for stealing a Bobcat front loader allegedly told police he needed it to protect his modesty.

Joseph Michael Hall, 19, said he had taken the tractor from a landscaping nursery because he was naked and wanted to use it to hide his nudity.

He was caught by police driving along Maynardville Highway outside Knoxville, Tennessee, at 7am on Sunday morning.

A member of the public had alerted authorities that someone had driven off with the Bobcat through a chainlink fence at the Out on a Limb nursery.

The arrest warrant said: 'Mr Hall stated that he was drunk and that he was trying to hide his nudity by taking the Bobcat.'

It was not clear why he was naked, theÂ Knoxville News Sentinel reported.

Mr Hall was charged with felony theft, public intoxication, underage consumption, misdemeanor vandalism and indecent exposure.

He was held at the Knox County Detention Facility on a bond of $6,250.

Bobcat is a US-based farm and building equipment company, that is part of the South Korean Doosan Group.

It manufactures vehicles like skid steer loaders, compact excavators, compact utility vehicles, compact tractors and other small hydraulic equipment.

Depending on the size, power and age of the machine, Bobcat front loaders can be worth anything from $5,000 second-hand to $60,000 brand new.
