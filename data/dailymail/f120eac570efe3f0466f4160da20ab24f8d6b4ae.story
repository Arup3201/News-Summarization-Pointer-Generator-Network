Holland’s devilish duo of Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben were on hand to inspire future Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal’s side to victory against Australia in Porto Alegre.

The Dutch, so impressive during their 5-1 thrashing of Spain in their opening Group B fixture, made hard work of what many believed would be a routine win.

Van Persie and Robben, in particular, 
raised their performances when needed in the second half though, as 
Holland overturned a 2-1 scoreline to make it two wins from two.

The
 Manchester United forward’s booking shortly after the break seemed to 
spark him to life. The yellow card means he will miss Holland’s final 
group match against Chile, but within minutes of his foul for a stray 
elbow he had drawn the Dutch level with an emphatic finish into the roof
 of the net.

Despite the 
goal taking him to eleven in his last 10 appearances for the national 
side, van Persie’s goal came as quite a surprise after an abject 
first-half performance.

The
 United attacker was anonymous in the first half, completing just a 
single pass as Holland were outthought and outmuscled by their 
opponents.

A fine 
individual goal from Arjen Robben gave Holland the lead in the 20th 
minute, before former Evertn star Tim Cahill equalised for Australia 
with an outrageous first-time volley.

A
 handball from Holland full-back Daryl Janmaat gifted Australia a 
penalty, with captain Mile Jedinak making no mistake from the spot, 
sweeping the ball past Jasper Cillessen.

It
 was then that Super-van came to the rescue. The striker received a pass
 inside the Autralia box, turned instinctively and then smashed a shot 
past Mathew Ryan.

Minutes 
later Holland were ahead through Memphis Depay, the 20-year-old beating 
Ryan with a speculative effort from distance that bounced in front of 
the keeper and nestled in the bottom right corner.

Van
 Gaal set Holland up with the exact same team that beat Spain so 
convincingly last week. Yet they struggled to reproduce the intensity of
 that performance, as Australia dominated the first half, with Cahill 
causing mayhem inside the Dutch box.

Watch
 Australia and you know exactly how they are going to score. Their 
full-backs and wingers try and hit Cahill in the air at every 
opportunity.

There were 
warning signs for the Dutch early on, but they seemed to switch off 
after going ahead through Robben. One minute and nine seconds later 
Cahill equalised with a finish van Persie would have been proud of.

The 
Australian attacker let a long diagonal drop over his shoulder and then 
lashed a volley in off the bar with his supposedly weaker foot.

Holland
 improved considerably all over the pitch after the break, with their 
defence breathing a collective sigh of relief when Cahill was withdrawn 
midway through the second half.

Van Gaal showed tactical flexibility by 
abandoning his five-man defence in the second half in favour of a flat 
back-four. This gave Holland a solidity they had been lacking before the
 interval and allowed them to deal with Australia’s considerable aerial 
threat.

A
 number of reported United targets were also on show for Holland. Wesley
 Sneijder, who revealed he would find it difficult to turn down an 
approach from his national boss, drifted in and out of the game, while 
left-back Daley Blind again impressed, grabbing his third assist of the 
tournament to set up Robben in the first-half.
