More than 650 people have been killed - most of them children - and hundreds more are still missing after a typhoon hit
the southern Philippines, triggering flash floods and landslides.

Typhoon
Washi, with winds gusting up to 56mph, hit the island of Mindanao late 
on Friday, bringing heavy rain that also grounded some domestic flights 
and left wide areas without power.

The
hardest-hit areas were the cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. Houses 
were swept into the sea while people were sleeping inside.

The Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC) estimated 652 people were killed in eight provinces in the southern Mindanao region.

'Our office was swamped with hundreds of requests to help find their missing parents, children and relatives,' said Gwendolyn Pang, secretary-general of the PNRC.

She added that the death toll was expected to rise as relief teams reached isolated areas. She said: 'It is very serious because the floods affected areas which have not experienced anything like this before.

'We have launched an appeal for support and we have received some already from our partners, including the Chinese Embassy and some corporations.

'There is a pressing need on how to handle the bodies. Water and food are also urgently required, as are hygiene kits, shelter and kitchen utensils.'

'This is the first time this has happened in our city,' Vicente Emano, mayor of Cagayan de Oro, said in a radio interview.  He said officials in the area did not receive adequate warning before the typhoon struck.

The British Government has offered 
its 'sincere condolences' to the families and friends of the victims, 
many of whom are understood to be children.

Filipino communities in London have 
sent messages of support and offered to take part in fund-raising 
activities to boost the relief effort, the Philippine Red Cross said.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said they were not aware at this time of any British deaths or casualties.

Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne said last night: 'The loss of life by flooding in the Philippines is tragic. I visited the Philippines earlier this month and know how keenly this loss will be felt by all its people.

'I would like to express my sincere 
condolences to the families and friends of those affected. My thoughts 
are with them and the government of the Philippines as they lead the 
recovery work.'

Carmelita Pulosan, 42, said she and 
eight family members and neighbours survived by sitting on top of the 
tin roof of their Cagayan de Oro house as it drifted miles into the open
sea after floodwaters swept through their village. They were rescued by
a passing cargo ship.    

She said: 'There was a deafening sound followed by a rush of water. We found ourselves in the river and the current took us out to the sea.

'The current was very strong. God is really good to us. He saved my family.' Only one 3-storey building was left standing in their village.

Amor Limbago, 21, of Cagayan de Oro, was at work when the storm struck. She tried calling home to check on her parents but they did not reply. 

She rushed home as soon as the flash floods receded and found her parents and seven other relatives were gone, swept away from their hut by the river.

She said: 'I returned and saw that our house was completely gone. There was nothing but mud all over and knee-deep floodwaters.'

Edmund Rubio, a 44-year-old engineer, said he, his wife and two children scrambled to the second floor of their house in Iligan city as floodwaters engulfed the first floor, destroying his TV set and other appliances and washing away his car and motorcycle.

Amid the panic, he heard a loud pounding on his door as neighbours living in nearby one-story houses pleaded with him to allow them up in his second floor.

He said he brought 30 neighbours into the safety of the second floor of his house, which later shook when a huge floating log slammed into it.

Brigadier General Roland Amarille, head of an army task force in Iligan, said soldiers had been mobilised to recover bodies and build coffins. Under-staffed mortuaries were unable to cope with the flood of bodies.

'We need body bags and lime to deal with too many cadavers,' Amarille said, fearing an outbreak of disease.

He said: 'Local mortuaries are no longer accepting cadavers and they are even asking people to bury the dead at once because there are too many bodies even in hallways.'

The PNRC's Pang said many officials and residents did not expect such a huge volume of water cascading down mountains into river systems because the area is not in the usual typhoon belt.         

She said Cagayan de Oro last experienced floods in 2009 but there was only minimal damage and no deaths. 

Many found their homes destroyed after returning to shattered villages, Pang said.               

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States, a major ally of the Philippines, was ready to assist Philippine authorities.

The Chinese embassy will donate $10,000 to help in the relief efforts, an embassy official said.  

Washi, downgraded to a tropical storm with gusts of up to 80 km per hour (50 miles per hour), is hovering about 60 km (40 miles) west of the southwestern city of Puerto Princesa and is expected to move out of Philippine waters later today.

Television pictures showed bodies 
covered in mud, cars piled on top of each other and wrecked homes. 
Helicopters and boats searched the sea for survivors.

Iligan
mayor Lawrence Cruz said many people were caught by surprise when water
levels rose by 3ft in less than an hour, forcing them on to their 
roofs.

‘This is the worst flooding our city has experienced  in years,’ he added.

Britons were last night urged not to 
travel to the parts of the Philippines ravaged by the floods. Before the
typhoon struck, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had already advised
people against travelling to the region due to terrorist and insurgent 
activity.

An average of 20 typhoons hit the Philippines every year, often causing death and destruction.
