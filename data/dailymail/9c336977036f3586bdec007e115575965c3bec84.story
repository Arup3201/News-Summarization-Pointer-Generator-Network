He found out his mother Julie was HIV positive when he was just six years old.

And as one would imagine this was a lot for Ryan Lewis to handle.

The 26-year-old has opened up to People about his childhood concerns saying: 'When you're that young and you know your mom has a really bad disease and she could be gone, you're just fearful.'

Opens up: In an interview with People magazine, Ryan Lewis revealed how he feared his mother would die from HIV when he was growing up

But despite his worries that she wouldn't make it, the musician -- who is best known for his work with Macklemore -- didn't stay silent about his mother's diagnosis.

'I was the most vocal about it. I was telling the grocery lady bagging my groceries. I told my entire second grade class,' the Same Love hitmaker told the magazine.

And his mother -- who contracted HIV from a blood transfusion while pregnant with his older sister in 1984 -- found Ryan's frankness to be quite comforting.

'It was kind of comic relief for our family because you didn't know when Ryan was going to bring it up or what he was going to say. I liked it because he kind of broke the stigma a little bit.'

Undiagnosed until 1990, Julie didn't know she had HIV while pregnant with Ryan or his sister, but fortunately she didn't pass it on her children.

'I was very lucky to have a 25 percent chance of infection and to not be infected,' said the Grammy Award-winning producer.

And after 30 years of living with the disease, Julie also finds a lot to be thankful for.

'I cherish [every milestone],' she said. 'It's a miracle that I've been so lucky to not only be at their graduations and weddings, but this past year, my two daughters both had babies and I was there for delivery. It's really been a huge blessing.'

Brave: Ryan Lewis is celebrating his mother Julie Lewis beating the odds and surviving 30 years on from her HIV positive diagnosis by creating the 30/30 Project to raise money for affordable healthcare worldwide

Julie Lewis found out she was HIV positive in 1990, six years after she contracted it via a blood transfusion following the birth of her eldest child, Teresa (pictured)

Remarkable: Julie Lewis has lived with AIDS for 30 years. No one else in her family have contracted it

Ryan first disclosed  his mother was HIV positive last week.

He made the revelation as he and Macklemore announced their foundation of the 30/30 Project, a nonprofit to raise money for affordable healthcare worldwide, and launched an indiegogo page for it.

Writing on the foundation’s website, Ryan said: 'In 1984, Juile Lewis gave birth to her first daughter, Teresa. Due to a complicated pregnancy, she needed a blood transfusion and at that moment, was infected with HIV.'

Macklemore also spoke out in a YouTube video for their foundation, saying: 'What a lot of people don't know is that Ryan Lewis' mom has lived with HIV for 30 years.

'Today we celebrate her life as a survivor with an initiative to bring healthcare to the areas of the world that need it most.'

Ryan also revealed that his mother did not know she had HIV when she was pregnant with him or his sister and they were fortunate to be born healthy despite a 25 per cent risk of contracting it.

He added: 'When she was finally diagnosed, she was given only a few years to live. By that time, she had already given birth to two other children, Laura and Ryan. They each had a 25% chance of being born HIV+, but we were both extremely fortunate (today, the risk of a mother passing HIV to her baby is 2% or less if she is being treated).

'And thanks to advanced medicine and healthcare available here in the U.S., Julie has survived despite her odds. This year marks the 30th anniversary of Julie’s survival, but many are not so lucky.'

Now to celebrate his mother defeating the odds and surviving 30 years on from from her diagnosis, Ryan has teamed up with Macklemore to create the charity which will work to build health centres around the world. 

In honor of his mother, Ryan has the international AIDS symbol - a red ribbon - tattooed on his arm

They are aiming to raise at least $100,000.

He added: 'To honour the thirty years my mom has been a survivor, our family is raising funds to build health centres worldwide that will stand strong for at least thirty years. We're calling it the 30/30 Project.

'We are partnering with Construction for Change, a Seattle-based nonprofit, to carry out construction. And we have local partners on the ground, such as Partners in Health, to run and operate the health facilities long-term. We want to give hope to women and families in other parts of the world who lack access to quality, affordable healthcare.

'With this amazing past year I've had, I am honored to be the first donor for the 30/30 Project, jumpstarting the construction of the first health center in Malawi. I am asking you to join my family and see how far we can take this...'

Lewis has previously spoken about how close he is to his parents and his two older sisters.

He was born into a middle-class, conservative Christian family who moved from Puyallup to Spokane, Washington, when he was two.

It wasn't until 1994, at the age of six, did his parents - who both worked for nonprofits - explain to him about AIDS and that his mother had it.

Julie Lewis contracted HIV following the birth of her eldest daughter Teresa (left) in 1984. It wasn't until six years later - after having another daughter, Laura (right) and son Ryan - that she was diagnosed

'This was an era when people were really shunned for having HIV,' Julie Lewis told Inlander in February last year.

'So when we moved to Spokane, we didn’t actually go public telling people for four more years.'

Julie then took the brave step of becoming part of the Spokane HIV/AIDS Speakers Bureau.

'It was a really interesting upbringing for my kids because literally most of the people who were on that speakers bureau, who were really good friends of our family, have died,' she said.

Ryan said it had a profound effect on him

'I think it really just opened up the door, as a kid, to life experiences that most of my friends didn’t know anything about,' he said.

'On one hand, you could look at it as a really hard, sh---y life thing; on the other hand, she’s been healthy for years.

'I didn’t get it, my sisters didn’t get it, my dad didn’t get it.

'It could’ve been a totally different thing.

'I could not be here.

'And she could not be here.

'But she is.'

In honor of his mother, Ryan has a tattoo on his right arm of an intertwined red ribbon - a variation of the international AIDS symbol.
