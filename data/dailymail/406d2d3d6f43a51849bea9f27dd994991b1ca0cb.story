Boko Haram militants are reported to have  kidnapped 185 women and children, after slaughtering 32 people in an attack on a remote village in northeast Nigeria.

Two officials, who requested anonymity, said the group gathered the women and children together and took them away in trucks after burning most of the village with petrol bombs

'After killing our youths, the insurgents have taken away our wives and daughters,' said Mukhtar Buba, who fled Gumsuri to the Borno state capital Maiduguri.

Details took four days to emerge because the mobile phone network has largely collapsed in the area roughly 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Maiduguri, and many of the roads are impassable.

Gumsuri is located on the road that leads to Chibok, where Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls from a school in April.

One of the local officials said the village had previously been protected against Boko Haram violence by a strong vigilante force, but that they were overpowered in Sunday's attack.

'For the past one year, the insurgents have made several attempts to attack Gumsuri but were resisted by the gallant youths of the village,' he told AFP. 'It is sad that on Sunday, the village was subdued,' he added.

The military and police were not immediately available for comment.

Boko Haram has repeatedly attacked the vigilante forces which have formed across the northeast, describing them as legitimate targets for siding with Nigeria's military.

Nigeria on Wednesday sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny, assault, cowardice and refusing to fight Islamic extremists.

The court-martial charges all were connected to the soldiers' refusal to deploy to recapture three towns seized by  Boko Haram in August, according to the charge sheet.

The lawyer for the condemned men, Femi Falana, said the 54 soldiers were convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad. He said five soldiers were acquitted.

They all were accused of 'conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of 7 Division, Nigerian Army,' which is on the front line of the fighting in the northeast of the West African nation.

Twelve soldiers were sentenced to death in September for mutiny and attempted murder of the commanding officer in the counter-insurgency. 

They blamed him for the deaths of an unknown number of soldiers ambushed and killed after they were ordered to drive at night on a road frequently attacked by the militants.

Troops regularly complain that they are outgunned by Boko Haram, they are not paid in full and they are abandoned on the battlefield without enough ammunition or food. 

The other local official said the insurgents 'stormed the village in a convoy of vehicles (armed) with petrol bombs' and heavy weapons.

Buba, the resident, said more than half the village had been destroyed.

'The terrorists mercilessly attacked us and killed at will,' he told AFP.

Borno is the epicentre of Boko Haram's five-year uprising aimed at creating a strict Islamic state in northern Nigeria.

Thousands of people have been killed in the five-year Islamic uprising that has driven some 1.3 million people from their homes, with tens of thousands fleeing across borders into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

Boko Haram has seized a string of towns and villages and in August declared an Islamic caliphate along Nigeria's border with Cameroon.

In recent weeks, Special Forces have been deployed and have recaptured at least four towns with help from air raids, traditional hunters and vigilantes.

The turnaround comes as Nigerians prepare for Feb. 14 presidential elections that are expected to be the most closely contested since decades of military dictatorship ended in 1999. 

President Goodluck Jonathan, 57, is being challenged by former military dictator Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, 72. 

Buhari is being touted by an opposition coalition as more likely to succeed in curbing the insurgency and in fighting corruption that Jonathan is accused of fueling.

Attacks similar to Sunday's violence in Gumsuri have escalated over the last 18 months, with the insurgents taking control of more than two dozen towns and villages in the region.

Kidnappings have also increased, part of a campaign by Boko Haram to boost its supply of child fighters, porters and young women who have reportedly been used as sex slaves.

The military has offered repeated assurances that the uprising will soon be contained, but so far there have been few signs of progress. 

Gumsuri is located in the northeast of Nigeria, roughly 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Maiduguri
