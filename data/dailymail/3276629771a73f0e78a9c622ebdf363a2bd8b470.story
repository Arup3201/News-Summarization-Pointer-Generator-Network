The many roles that teachers are expected to fill beyond the bounds of educator seem to be increasing every year.

Now there is greater pressure than ever for them to take on the role of a doctor too, as the number of children who need regular medication during school hours continues to rise.

However the perils of this were proven earlier in the week when a young boy was given another student's medication by accident, the Herald Sun report.

Teachers are now taking on more responsibility than ever and at many schools are administering their students' medication

A six-year-old boy called Mitchell who needed ritalin - which is used to treat attention deficit disorder - was apparently given another child's medication by accident.

The child's teacher apparently figured out what had happened very quickly, but he had already swallowed the wrong tablet.

Mitchell's dad Gus Reynolds told the publication he understands that accidents occur but he was not happy with the way the his son's school - Iramoo Primary School in Melbourne's west - handled the situation.

This week a young boy was given the wrong medication at school when it was mixed up with another child's

'As humans we can make mistakes, but it was the way it was handled', Mr Reynolds said. The teachers apparently did not keep an eye on the boy to check for any potential side effects.

However Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace pointed out that the demands on teachers are increasing and the responsibility they have is much greater than a decade ago.

Ms Peace also said as some children need various doses of some medications at various times throughout the day - this can be very difficult to keep track of.

Some students require medication more than once a day and this places pressure on teachers

The issue is a complex one and in some cases teachers are taking on the role of doctors, when they are not necessarily trained to do so.

The increase in children taking medication is said to be due to a rise in the number of kids with either allergies or behavioral issues which require medication as part of their treatment.

Iramoo Primary School's principal said the mix-up occurred because one of the medication wasn't labelled properly and therefore got combined with another student's.

The school is now apparently looking at a new system which could see children's pictures attached to their medication to avoid any further issues.
