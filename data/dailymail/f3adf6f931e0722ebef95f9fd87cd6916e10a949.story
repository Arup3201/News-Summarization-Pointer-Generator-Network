Britain faces yet another week of cold weather, with rain expected throughout the country and some places seeing a return of wintry showers.

Winds of up to 40mph will sweep across the UK and forecasters say it will be at least a fortnight before we can hope to see any prolonged sunshine again.

Temperatures in England had entered double digits on Saturday and yesterday for the first time this month, hitting 11C (52F).

Yesterday, it was 10.9C in Coningsby, 
Lincolnshire, and 10.5C in St James’s Park, central London as Britons 
basked in sunny spells across the country, at last able to shed their 
winter coats and put on sunglasses.

The Met Office says that today will be
another fine day for those in the South of England – but then it will 
be time to put the winter woollies, hats and scarves back on as 
unseasonably chilly conditions return.

Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: ‘Temperatures have been coming up in the right direction compared to recent weeks.

‘Quite a few places had double digit 
temperatures over the weekend and Monday will be a fairly good day 
across much of the country.

Boaters also enjoyed the sunny conditions in Cambridge, as daffodils finally bloomed

Further north, on the The Isle of Arran, Scotland, this stunning picture captured a rather more mixed weather outlook and a combination of storm clouds, snow on the mountain peaks and rays of sun light broke through the clouds

Brighton was one of the towns to get lucky with the weather, and these women donned the sunshades to make sure they took advantage

‘But from Monday night going into 
Tuesday, there will be wintry weather with rain and wind around and it 
won’t feel spring-like.’ He added that Friday and Saturday were forecast
to be slightly milder but that next week will see more strong winds and
rain.

It is likely to be two weeks before temperatures hit the average for April, around 13C (55F).

Temperatures last week were among the 
lowest experienced in April for almost a century, adding to the snow 
flurries endured throughout much of March.

The price of a bag of chips is set to 
soar due to Britain’s severe winter and spring – along with the cost of 
fruit and other vegetables, the Potato Council says.

The cost of potatoes has risen by 50 per cent after the big freeze hit harvests, with more French varieties going on sale here.

Spring sunseekers in Bournemouth and Brighton hit the beach yesterday while rowers took to the river in Cambridge. Even the animals looked happier, with spring lambs pictured playing in Rutland.
