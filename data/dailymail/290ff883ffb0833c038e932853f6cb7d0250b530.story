Brave: Victim of abuse John McCabe has successfully campaigned for a new police investigation into sex crimes at a Durham borstal

A borstal boy who was among hundreds abused by a paedophile ring in prison while police allegedly turned a blind eye has won a campaign to have the case re-opened.

John McCabe was sexually assaulted at 17 at the Medomsley Detention Centre, County Durham, by members of a gang he said raped him 'every single day'.

Police have re-launched their investigation after complaints were ignored, amid claims many boys were systematically abused by 'agents of the state' in the 1970s and 1980s.

Two prison officers were jailed after a 2003 investigation, Lesley Johnson for six years and warden Neville Husband for 12 years. It was Husband who abused Mr McCabe.

But at least four other staff were said to be involved and in one case a victim allegedly spoke to police about being abused in the 1970s and was told to 'f*** off' or he’d be sent back to prison.

Mr McCabe, who suffered six months of attacks and has waived his right to anonymity to tell his story, told the Daily Mirror: 'I was asked to work in the kitchens. That’s where I met him (Husband). He told me if I didn’t do what he wanted he’d kill me and nobody would care.

‘I thought I was the only boy he abused. Now I know there were more. A lot more. And it wasn’t just him.

'I’m fighting for justice for those boys, for myself. Too many people have got away with this for far too long.'

John went to the police in 2009 after Husband was released, but the Crown Prosecution Service took no action, leaving him 'devastated'.

His local MP, Michael McCann, Labour's representative in East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, has helped his constituent with the campaign.

He told MailOnline: 'John and I have carried this on and want to help in any way we can.

'If anyone has any information about abuse inside the detention centre or outside we would like them to tell the police.

'There were two convicted but we know there were others who carried out abuse and were never brought to justice.

'John has been incredibly brave in talking about what happened to him and I hope that it will inspire bravery in others.

'There were people who were abused by agents of the state and when they tried to get help it was refused. I don't believe that will happen now'.

Police are appealing for any victims to come forward.

Det Supt Paul Goundry, head of safeguarding for Durham Constabulary said: 'Neville Husband preyed on some of the most vulnerable children and young people in our society and left many of them with mental scars which have lasted a lifetime.

'While we contacted and took statements from a number of victims as part of this investigation, we believe there are others who for whatever reason have never come forward. It is those people we are now asking to contact us and pass on any information about what took place during their time at Medomsley, whether it happened at the centre or off-site.

I can assure them we have experienced officers on hand to talk to them and they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity.

'What happened at Medomsley was organised abuse on a large scale and we are committed to ensuring every victim feels they have had the opportunity to speak. Throughout our enquiries we will be in constant touch with the CPS who will ultimately advise on whether there are grounds to bring criminal charges.

'John has shown great bravery in giving up his right to anonymity and talking about the abuse he suffered. I hope that by doing so he will encourage others to come forward and pass on any information they have.'

Anyone with information should dial 101 and ask for Durham Constabulary.
