Earlier this week, controversial Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld caused outrage after telling an interviewer that 'no one wants to see curvy women on the catwalk'.

Now artist aleXsandro Palombo has given the German designer a taste of his own medicine by creating a series of cartoons that portray him as grossly overweight.

And Lagerfeld isn't alone. Also in line for the Palombo treatment were Anna Wintour, Kate Moss and Tom Ford among others.

The Lagerfeld images show the designer bulging out of his trademark monochrome suit and ensconced in an armchair guzzling fast food.

Donatella Versace is pictured spilling out of a tight red dress while an unusually dishevelled Tom Ford sits eating burgers in a crumpled suit.

Palombo is famous for his controversial cartoons and is no stranger to portraying the likes of Wintour and Lagerfeld in unusual situations, having previously authored a series that showed Wintour performing scenes from the Kama Sutra with Homer Simpson.

This time, says Palombo, the aim is to highlight the issue of fat in fashion - a subject that he believes is ignored.

'The topic of [being] oversize is still a
 taboo in the fashion business,' explained Palombo. 'With this series, I
 wanted to do a true tribute to the concept.'

Palombo, who also revealed that his 
favourite fashion icon is Anna Wintour, added: 'I think that fashion is 
chasing obsolete ideals more than suggesting impossible ones.

'We are living [through] big changes but I feel that fashion is living in the past - the 80s are long gone.

'Fashion magazines are becoming less interesting but they continue to offer sad and boring women as an ideal - they are obviously  the mirror of the editors more than their readers.'

Despite his love of lampooning fashion's great and good, Palombo boasts a very stylish CV of his own.

Previously a 
knitwear designer, he showed his collections at Milan Fashion Week, before turning his attention to satire via his blog 
Humor Chic.

He describes the blog as a daily society portrait: 
'The best illustrated fashion chronicle, a point of view about costume, 
politics, culture, society and celebrity,' and describes himself as 'the
 father of Fashion Satire, visionary artist, author and critic.'

Earlier this week, it was revealed that the Chanel supremo was facing legal action after telling an interviewer that 'no one wants to see curvy girls on the catwalk'.

Although this is the first time the designer has faced court action because of his bons mots, he's not known for pulling his verbal punches.

Here are some of the other injured parties:

Russia:  'If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly. There are a few handsome ones, like Naomi Campbell's boyfriend, but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men.'

Greece: 'Greece needs to work on a cleaner image. It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt. You can't be sure the money will go where it's supposed to go,' he concluded. 'Nobody wants Greece to disappear, but they have really disgusting habits. Italy as well.'

The facially challenged: 'Life is not a beauty contest, some [ugly people] are great. What I hate is nasty, ugly people. The worst is ugly short men. Women can be short, but for men it is impossible. It is something that they will not forgive in life - they are mean and they want to kill you.'

The politically correct:  'Be politically correct, but please don't bother other people with conversation about being politically correct, because that's the end of everything. You want to create boredom? Be politically correct in your conversation.'

Pippa Middleton: 'Kate Middleton has a nice silhouette. I like that kind of woman, I like romantic beauties. On the other hand, the sister struggles. I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back.'

Adele: 'The thing at the moment is Adele. She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice.'

Lana Del Rey: 'Is she a construct with all her implants?'

Heidi Klum: 'I don't know Heidi Klum. She was never known in France. Claudia Schiffer also doesn't know who she is.'
