A man has developed a bizarre allergy to the cold that means that even a single snowflake could kill him.

Bernard Ward's skin explodes into angry hives if he comes into contact with anything cold - from a snowflake to a cold pint of beer.

And the reactions can be so bad that he can even go into potentially fatal anaphylactic shock.

Bernard Ward suffers from a bizarre allergy to the cold. The retail worker's skin explodes into angry hives if he comes into contact with anything cold - from a snowflake to a cold pint of beer

Doctors believe Mr Ward developed the condition after standing at a bus stop in temperatures of -10C in Scotland last year.

The retail worker now has to wrap up warm even indoors - and doesn’t dare venture outside in particularly cold weather.

Even the gym is out of bounds - because the air conditioning could trigger a deadly reaction.

Mr Ward, from Derry, Northern Ireland, said: 'I dread winter coming - I know most people don’t like the cold but it could be deadly for me.

'It costs me a fortune in heating bills and thick clothes, but I have no other choice.

'Since I developed the allergy, it’s 
totally changed my life. A simple night out with my mates down the pub 
is out of the question.'

Mr Ward's reactions can be so bad that he can even go into potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. He now has to wrap up warm even indoors - and doesn't dare venture outside in particularly cold weather

He first noticed some aggravation to the cold while commuting to Belfast in winter 2011.

He said: 'Every time I was waiting for the bus my hands began to itch really badly and burn, as if I had put them in a pile of nettles.

'I thought nothing of it and got on with things and hoped it would go away.

'My GP said it was probably a reaction to washing powder, or something I’d eaten, but in February 2012, I was on a three-week course in Scotland.

'On my first evening there, it was about -10, and I was waiting on a bus to take me back to the hotel. I wasn’t wearing any gloves and I was carrying bags.

'After a few minutes my fingers and hands began to swell up so badly I couldn’t bend them.

Mr Ward was eventually diagnosed with cold uticaria - a type of allergy that causes the body to react badly to not only touching anything cold, but also sudden drops in temperature

'My face also was burning and itching and I was wheezing. I got to the hotel room, after changing out of my clothes into something warmer, I noticed my thighs had swollen and were covered in huge welts, too.'

It was only then that doctors diagnosed him with a severe allergy to the cold.

Mr Ward added: 'At the time, I worked in a busy retail store, the air conditioning was on for about an hour and I just didn’t feel well and couldn’t work out why.

'I remember feeling like I was going to faint and I was having the most uncomfortable heart palpitations.

'I went out the back to sit down for a bit and noticed my hands were covered in hives.

Mr Ward must wear gloves to touch anything cold. He said: 'Having cold drinks made my throat swell and even holding a pint of cold beer on a night out made my hand swell up'

'I wrapped up took antihistamines and went home. After this I was referred to a specialist.'

A hospital specialist confirmed that Bernard was suffering from cold urticaria - a type of allergy that causes the body to react badly to not only touching anything cold, but also sudden drops in temperature.

At present there is no known cure for cold urticaria but it can be managed through the use of antihistamines 
and keeping as warm us possible.

He said: 'Initially it got me very down and anxious. I couldn't understand what was happening to me and I kept thinking that it would go away soon.

'I gradually stopped doing everyday things like going to the gym as the air conditioning affected me.

'I could no longer play football as playing outdoors gave me bad reactions and socialising became a nightmare.

'Having cold drinks made my throat swell and even holding a pint of cold beer on a night out made my hand swell up.

Support: Mr Ward with his fiance Mairead. He said: 'Going out at night is not an easy task either as we have to plan in advance and have taxi pick us up then leave early, to avoid not standing in a taxi queue at night'

'I have to wear ridiculous amounts of clothes in the winter and it's tough covering transport costs, clothing costs and fuel bills.'

Although the condition has had a massive impact on his life and those closest to him, Bernard says he has amazing support from his family including his fiancé Mairead who he hopes to marry next year.

'My fiancé has been great. She adapted really well to my condition and gives me support every day.

'At first things were tough and they still are as we can no longer do outdoor things like going for a walk.

'Going out at night is not an easy task either as we have to plan in advance and have taxi pick us up then leave early as to not be standing in a taxi queue at night.

'It took people a while to realise the extent of it and people do still forget themselves sometimes and ask me to do things which I just can’t do any more.'

Cold urticaria is an allergy to cold temperatures, where exposure causes redness, itching, swelling and hives on the skin.

As much as possible, people with cold urticaria should avoid exposure to cold air and cold water. Swimming in cold water, for example, is the most common cause of a severe, whole-body reaction - leading to fainting, shock and even death, according to the Mayo Clinic.

The majority of cold urticaria reactions occur when skin is exposed to temperatures lower than 4.4C (40 F), but some people can have reactions to warmer temperatures. Damp and windy conditions may make cold urticaria more likely.

Symptoms include: Reddish, itchy hives (wheals) on the area of skin that was exposed to cold, swelling of hands when holding cold objects, swelling of lips when eating cold foods.

What causes the condition isn't clear, but some people appear to have overly sensitive skin cells, either due to an inherited trait or caused by a virus or other illness.

In some cases, cold urticaria goes away on its own after several months. In other cases, it lasts many years.
