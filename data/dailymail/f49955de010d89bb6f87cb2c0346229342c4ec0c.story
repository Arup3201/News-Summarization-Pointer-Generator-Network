The English executive who was arrested as part of a World Cup ticket touting investigation has given up his accreditation for the tournament.

Ray Whelan, a director of MATCH Services which provides ticket, hospitality, accommodation and IT services for FIFA, was arrested by police in Rio de Janeiro as part of Operation Jules Rimet.

MATCH has described his arrest as 'illegal' and criticised the police investigation, while Whelan, who has been freed on bail, insists he has committed no wrongdoing.

A statement from MATCH read: 'Mr 
Whelan's arrest was arbitrary and illegal. The leakage of fragments of 
Ray's wire-tapped private conversations... is also illegal.

'The
 18th Precinct Rio Police are making assumptions without a proper 
investigation and with minimal understanding of how the ticket and 
hospitality package selling system really works.

'The
 police have not attempted to investigate the facts and have 
consequently proceeded to misrepresent the relevance of their findings.

'Mr Ray Whelan will voluntarily relinquish his accreditation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil today.

'In
 doing so, Mr Whelan wishes to reaffirm his total commitment to 
safeguard the interests of the company MATCH Services, as well as FIFA 
and the FIFA World Cup. Mr Whelan wishes to reiterate that he takes this
 decision with no acceptance of wrongdoing and that he remains fully 
cooperative for further investigations which he is certain will 
exonerate him.'

Police 
arrested Whelan in the Copacabana Hotel, which is the base for FIFA's 
top executives, and seized 83 hospitality packages and tickets, a 
laptop, two mobile phones and 1,300 US dollars.

MATCH
 said the police had refused to provide details of the tickets that were
 seized but that they believe the tickets were for past matches, 
retained as mementoes, or for personal use by senior management of MATCH
 and their families and friends.

MATCH
 said recordings of mobile phone conversations between Whelan and an 
Algerian, Lamine Fofana, who police allege was the leader of the ticket 
touting ring, only showed Whelan legitimately negotiating the sale of 
hospitality packages to Fofana.

MATCH
 admitted that offering the packages for cash was 'highly unusual' but 
that it was 'permitted under the various terms and conditions' and that 
the transactions never actually took place.

'MATCH
 wishes to state that there is nothing inappropriate or criminal in the 
way Mr Whelan has conducted himself in the phone conversation recorded 
by the police,' said the statement.

'He was quoting the availability of the correct product at the correct price.'
