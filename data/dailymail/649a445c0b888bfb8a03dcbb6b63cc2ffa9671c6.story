On November 9, 2005, Sajida Al-Rishawi held one finger over the trigger of her suicide belt, ready to spray hundreds of innocent wedding guests in Jordan with deadly ball bearings  in the name of al-Qaeda.

But her belt jammed and she fled as her newly-wed husband took the lives of dozens of guests, including the bride and groom's fathers at the luxury Raddison SAS hotel in Amman.

Held for ten years on death row, she has now been hanged in an apparent retaliation after Islamic State militants released a sickening video showing a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage.

Her story takes her from a powerful Iraqi family to being sent to her death by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the lieutenant of her own Islamist extremist brother.

Following her failed attack in 2005, which was coordinated with two other near-simultaneous attacks on Amman hotels, killing 60 people, she told Jordanian television: 'We went into the hotel.

'[My husband] took a corner and I took another. There was a wedding in the hotel. There were women and children.'

'My husband executed the attack. I tried to detonate and it failed.'

'People began to run, and I ran out with them.'

Although little is known about al-Rishawi, now in her 40s, her family are said to have hailed from a powerful Sunni clan in Western Iraq. 

Al-Rishawi, who was from the city of Ramadi in Iraq's militant stronghold of Anbar province, seemed to have a motive for her failed attack after two of herbrothers were killed during U.S. military operations in Anbar.

Although al-Rishawi fled, her husband successfully detonated his bomb, killing 38 people in one of three coordinated attacks at similar venues on the same day in Amman, Jordan

The luxury wedding suite inside the Radisson SAS hotel was almost unrecognisable following the explosion which killed the bride and groom's parents.

But her suicide attempt at the packed luxury wedding venue was ordered by her brother's lieutenant, al-Zarqawi, a top lieutenant and founder of al Qaeda's Iraq branch - which went on to form Islamic State. Al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. airstrike in June 2006.

In the days after she fled the carnage of her failed suicide attack, al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for all three attacks and mentioned a woman being involved.

Jordanian officials arrested al-Rishawi four days later at a safe house, one of two apartments the suicide team rented in a residential neighborhood.

Several days later, al-Rishawi appeared on Jordanian state television, opening a body-length overcoat to reveal two crude explosive belts, one with RDX and the other with ball-bearings.

Later at the trial, al-Rishawi pleaded not guilty and said through her lawyer that she never tried to detonate her bomb and was forced to take part in the attack. But an explosives expert testified that the trigger mechanism on al-Rishawi's belt had jammed.

Al-Rishawi, who was in her 40s, was sentenced to death by hanging and an appeals court later ratified her sentence, describing her as 'guilty beyond doubt of possessing explosives and having had the intention and the will to carry out terrorist attacks whose outcome is destruction and death.' 

In the aftermath of al-Rishawi's attacks, Jordan's Deputy Prime Minister Marwan Muasher told CNN that al-Rishawi was not wearing a suicide belt when she was captured.

But she was found with two explosive belts. One was reportedly filled with  RDX, a powerful explosive, and the other held the deadly ball bearings, ready to be sprayed into the crowds.

Deadly ball bearings are regularly used as shrapnel packed around the explosives which are tied onto the body on a vest or belt.

When the explosives are detonated, the balls are launched in every direction with their speed and  power close to that of bullets.

The explosion has been described as equivalent to a shotgun blast going off in all directions.

The ball bearings, regularly 3-7 millimeters in diameter,  cause the most damage from the explosion.

Ball bearings are often used with other small metal objects, including nails.

'The aim was to inflict the largest number of casualties,' Muasher said. 

Little is known about husband Hussein Ali al-Shamari. It was reported that lights went out at the wedding before he jumped on the dining table and detonated his bomb, killing 38 people.

Moments before the attack in the wedding suite of the Amman Raddisson, bride Nadia al-Alami stood next to her new husband, Ashraf Mohamed al-Akhras, posing for photos before dozens of guests were killed.

Al-Rishawi's execution, at about 4am local time today, came just hours after Islamic State militants released a sickening video showing a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage.

Jordan had vowed a swift and lethal response and government officials this morning revealed that two prisoners, Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad al-Karbouli, have already been hanged.

The executions took place after gruesome footage emerged showing Jordanian pilot  al-Kasasbeh being torched to death by his captors.
