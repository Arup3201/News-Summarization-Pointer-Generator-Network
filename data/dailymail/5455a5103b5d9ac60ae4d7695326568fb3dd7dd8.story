Even his most ardent fans may have blinked and missed it. But David Bowie yesterday published all the lyrics to his first album for ten years – in a newspaper advert.

Typeset as four finely printed columns of text with his name at the end, the full-page advert in The Times marks the final bit of publicity ahead of tomorrow’s release of The Next Day.

Bowie, 66, has also been publishing the lyrics on his Twitter page and on Facebook.

But critics said that many would have flicked past the newspaper page without realising it actually contained all 17 new songs, which have titles such as Dirty Boys, Valentine’s Day and The Stars (Are Out Tonight).

David Bowie's ad contained the lyrics of his songs including from his 1973 album Aladdin Sane

Steve Turner, a pop expert who has written extensively on Bowie, said: ‘It’s very avant garde. It’s very Bowie. It’s an advert, but with no reference to what the advert is about.

‘Having no line breaks also makes it more difficult to read.’

Some lyrics focus on the reclusive star’s stay in West Berlin from 1976 to 1979.

There are also references to the writer Vladimir Nabokov, the Belgian poet Georges Rodenbach, and the American folk singers Pete Seeger and Joan Baez.

Bowie officially announced the release of his album on his website on Friday.

He even gave an explanation for his long hiatus from the music world.

An official statement read: ‘In recent years radio silence has been broken only by endless speculation, rumour and wishful thinking .. a new record... who would have ever thought it, who’d have ever dreamed of it?

‘After all David is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants...when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell.

‘Today, he definitely has something to say.’

The response to David Bowie’s new album,
The Next Day, has been one of unshackled euphoria.

Grown men who have 
witnessed  a dozen Bowie ‘comebacks’  (I remember three in 1974 alone) 
have been treating the record as though it has some sort of magical, 
transformative powers, preferring to ignore the fact his last two 
records – Heathen, in 2002, and 2003’s Reality – were equally as good.

Their enthusiasm is an expression of relief as much as anything – relief
that someone we have all invested so much emotional energy in over the 
years can still deliver ‘the goods’.

What is truly remarkable is yet more proof of Bowie’s (pretty much) 
innate ability to place himself in exactly the right place in any 
contemporary pop cultural matrix.

For instance, the videos for Where Are
We Now? and The Stars (Are Out Tonight) – unequivocally the two best 
songs on the record, reminding you that Bowie still has an acute 
commercial sense – are not just smart,  inventive and oddly 
self-deprecating, they’re also perfect examples of Bowie’s ability to 
wind narrative around him in a totally  age-appropriate way.

Many of the reviews of The Next Day have indicated that this record breaks new ground for Bowie, which on occasion it does.

Bowie’s own particular creative charabanc may have more wheels on it 
than practically anyone else’s in the music industry, but he  hasn’t 
reinvented it. A wheel is  still a wheel no matter how many times you 
turn it.

Consequently, you can hear echoes from many of his previous records on 
The Next Day, everything from The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And 
The Spiders From Mars (and in particular the Five Years drum coda on the
brilliantly histrionic You Feel So Lonely You Could Die), Heroes, 
Lodger, Scary Monsters, The Buddha Of Suburbia and Outside as well as – 
saliently – his last two albums.

There are some seriously good tunes on the album, which is released 
tomorrow, not least the beautiful anti-war I’d Rather Be High.

Do we 
really have to rely on a sexagenarian like Bowie to write the greatest 
protest song of the new decade? Apparently we do.

Personally, I think the album is two or three songs too long (there are 14 plus three additional tracks on the deluxe version) but then what 
album isn’t these days?

And I hardly think you can begrudge Bowie from 
overloading his comeback album, having not released anything officially 
for a decade.

In the ten years since Bowie has been away, he has been more active than
at any time in his career.

Or rather, we have all been active on his 
behalf. In this vacuum has arisen one of the greatest mass cults of the 
modern age.

You may have thought Bowie was  a cult hero before he disappeared, but 
since 2003 Bowieism has become even more of a religion than Presleyism. 
There have been dozens and dozens of newspaper articles, magazine 
covers, exhibitions, anniversaries, homages, books (apologies), TV 
specials and films.

There’s even a plaque in Heddon Street in London’s West End to 
commemorate the photo session for the Ziggy Stardust LP (and to which we
Bowiephiles all trooped, out of little but abject devotion).

Back in 1974, Bowie released a ramshackle concert album called David 
Live. He looked and sounded so tired, jaded and drug-addled, he later 
said it should have been called David Bowie Is Alive And Well And Living
Only In Theory.

Well, in 2013, and at the mighty  age of 66, it can safely be said that 
David Bowie Is Alive And Well  And Operating At The Very  Height Of His 
Powers. Still.
