A grand jury in Missouri has been given until January next year to decide whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged for the shooting  of teenager Michael Brown.

The deadline for the grand jury has been extended until January 7 to allow them to consider whether there is enough evidence to criminally charge Wilson, CNN reports. 

But this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will take that long.

During this time, the grand jury will mull testimony and come to a decision whether they believe Wilson committed a crime when he shot dead Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, on August 9.

Outrage over the shooting led to days of protests and a heated debate over whether Brown's race played a role

St. Louis County Judge Carolyn Whittington initially said the grand jury could sit until November. But she extended that order for another 60 days on September 10, taking the grand jury's meetings into early 2015.

So far, police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting. 

The confusion  fuelled tensions in Ferguson, where outrage over the shooting led to days of protests and a heated debate over whether Brown's race played a role in his death.

Brown, like two-thirds of his neighbors in Ferguson, was black. Wilson is white, like most of the city's police officers.

The grand jury, which meets in secrecy, consists of nine white people (six men and three women) and three black people (two women and a man), court officials have said.
