NBC's coverage of the London Olympics may have drawn record ratings, but it has been met with an often derisive reception from many parts of the internet.

While most of the criticism has focussed on the controversial tape delay, several commentators have now turned on host Ryan Seacrest, who anchors much of the coverage.

Many have attacked Mr Seacrest's background in showbiz rather than sport, with one journalist describing him as 'a personality marked mostly by lack of personality'.

However, the star hit back at the criticism, saying: 'You can't please everyone.'

Mr Seacrest, who is best known for presenting American Idol and producing Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has little experience broadcasting sporting events.

He has appeared on NBC every day of the Olympics, interviewing U.S. medallists and joining the Today show team in a number of sporting-themed activities.

The gap between his sporting inexperience and his presence on the airwaves has angered some established sports journalists as well as web users.

'Everyone in the industry is talking about what a bad move it was to include Ryan Seacrest on the NBC coverage this year,' an anonymous sportscaster told Radar Online.

Defence: Mr Seacrest admitted that 'you can't please everyone' but pointed out NBC's strong ratings

One acerbic tweeter wrote: 'Who better to cover the greatest athletes in the world than Ryan Seacrest... probably almost anybody'.

And Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara added to the abuse, saying his appearances showed 'not only his lack of sports knowledge but also the mystifyingly successful Seacrest brand of blandocity.'

She added: 'Though inarguably one of the hardest workers in the industry, he is, on television anyway, a personality marked mostly by lack of personality, a greeter more than a host, a scrim more than a player.'

According to Ms McNamara, one of Mr Seacrest's most memorable moments came when he promised to put U.S. gymnasts in touch with singer Justin Bieber.

The presenter has attempted to defend himself as well as NBC, which has repeatedly come under fire for delaying the broadcast of key events such as races involving Michael Phelps.

He told the Hollywood Reporter: 'As I've learned from all my years in television, you can't please everyone. I believe the huge ratings NBC has drawn for the Olympics speak for themselves.'

When asked what made sports coverage different from Hollywood, Mr Seacrest replied: 'Olympic athletes are celebrities too, so there are similarities, though athletes are typically a lot taller.'

Jim Bell, executive producer of the network's Olympic coverage, also stood up for NBC, saying: 'Of course we're going to do everything we can to serve the audience.'
