HTC's Android Evo 4G phone: British phone users will be able to enjoy a new ultra-fast '4G' network far sooner than thought

British phone users will be able to enjoy a new ultra-fast '4G' network far sooner than thought.

Carriers Vodafone and O2 will fast-track the service after banding together to launch the hi-tech network, which offers download speeds akin to the ones on home broadband connections.

No release date was given for the new 'next generation' network to launch.

The current model of the iPad has a 4G aerial, but there are no national networks in the UK for 4G.

It's also not clear whether any UK network would work with iPad, as there are several competing standards for the technology.

Phone company Everything Everywhere 
has submitted an application to Ofcom to use its existing 1800MHz 
'slice' of mobile spectrum to deliver 4G services in the UK.

But
it's a slightly different frequency to the U.S. networks the new iPad 
is built to work on - and it's not clear whether Apple will update its 
tablet to work with the UK's network.

'4G' is used widely in the U.S., and is the successor to the current 3G network, but built from the ground up for high-speed data.

Vodafone and O2 already have a more 
basic sharing agreement in Britain, and the deal to pool basic network 
infrastructure will increase their national coverage to 98 percent by 
2015 and speed up the roll-out of fourth-generation services, they 
said. 

Vodafone estimates that around 
two-thirds of the population currently have access to third-generation 
indoor mobile coverage, and the government has been calling on operators
to increase that reach to make the country more efficient to boost the 
economy.   

‘Faced with a host of macro-economic and
sector threats, the European Telecom sector is finally addressing some 
of the basic business model problems they face and laying the groundwork
for a much more profitable recovery,’ Bernstein analyst Robin 
Bienenstock said.    

Olaf Swantee, CEO at Everything Everywhere, said earlier this year, ¿Everything Everywhere¿s vision is to launch 4G for Britain as soon as possible.'

Vodafone and O2, which is owned by Spain's Telefonica , said they would form a joint venture in Britain to pool their infrastructure to improve coverage and speed up the roll-out of a fourth-generation network.   

Analysts said the pair's move could be replicated in other European markets such as Spain and Germany, which could have a knock-on effect on other operators struggling with fierce competition, regulatory pressure and weak consumer spending.   

‘This will create two stronger players who will compete with each other and with other operators to bring the benefits of mobile internet services to consumers and businesses across the country,’ Vodafone UK Chief Executive Guy Laurence said, adding that it would give Britain the 4G networks it will need tomorrow.    

The super-fast 4G aerial in the new iPad will allow users to connect to the web at near-broadband speeds - but UK users might miss out

The agreement will also help O2 and Vodafone, ranked second and third respectively in Britain, to compete with market leader Everything Everywhere, which runs the Orange and T-Mobile brands, in the fight to have the best network.   

The smallest operator, 3, has a network-sharing deal with Everything Everywhere.
