Details have now emerged surrounding Marcus Arceneaux's dramatic rescue of bloodied cousin Bethany.

Marcelus Arcenaux kicked in the door of the abandoned house ex-boyfriend Scott Thomas was holding her after seeing Bethany in danger. What happened next is straight out of Hollywood.

In the violent confrontation that followed, Ms Arceneaux was stabbed by Mr Thomas just before he was shot dead by her cousin, CNN reported.

Mr Arcenaux tracked his cousin to the abandoned house in only two days. Once there, he saw Bethany through a window - she was in grave danger.

He kicked down the door as Mr Taylor began stabbing the 29-year-old mother of his child, and fired several rounds but was not sure if he hit the violent man, he told CNN.

'We kicked doors down. It was like a movie unfolding,' Miss Arceneaux's brother, Ryan, told the Advertiser. 'If we would have waited, she would have been dead.'

Officers instead found Mr Taylor's body in the home later that evening and have since ruled the shooting justified. It is still under investigation by the District Attorney's Office.

This wasn't the first time he had violated a restraining order protecting the previously abused woman.

Ryan Arceneaux was part of a search party made up of family and friends who were helping police try to find Ms Arceneaux after Mr Thomas, the father of her two-year-old son, kidnapped her on Wednesday evening.

At around noon on Friday the group were investigating an abandoned house, barely visible through the sugar cane fields surrounding it.

The house, on Anderson Road, was close to where Mr Thomas had ditched his car on Wednesday night.

Kaylyn Alfred, another of the victim's brothers, said they heard screams for help as they entered the desolate building.

As the search party confronted Mr Thomas, who was the subject of a restraining order, he allegedly began to harm Miss Arceneaux.

In the tussle that followed Mr Thomas was shot and Marcus Arceneaux was able to grab and carry her to safety.

'She’s shook up, she’s sliced up, but she’s alright, Ryan said. His sister was believed to have been stabbed but is recovering in hospital and has been reunited with her son.

Captain Kip Justice of the Lafayette Parish Police Department confirmed that 29-year-old father died as a result of injuries received in the confrontation.

In June Bethany Arceneaux filed a protection order against Scott Thomas, after he locked her inside their home and made threats to harm her.

Thomas was barred from coming near his ex-girlfriend or son, and was ordered to stay away from her home and his child's daycare center.

In the order she claimed Thomas had choked her, dragged her by her hair and 'held a knife to my throat countless times'.

During the final episode before she left him she said he made threats to kill her. 

She
added: 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my 
work looking for me. I am afraid for me and my son's life.'

Thomas abducted Miss Arceneaux as she collected her son from daycare on Wednesday, November 6.

'The
man began harming her. He [Arceneaux’s family member] did what he 
needed to do to stop that aggressive behavior from Mr Thomas,' Captain 
Judice said.

Police, who 
were also searching for the victim and were close by when shots were 
fired, are now trying to piece together what happened.

The
search for Ms Arceneaux began when witnesses saw Mr Thomas throw her 
into a car at 5.20pm on Wednesday as she collected their son from a 
daycare center.

Their child was later found abandoned in the car.

Ms Arceneaux had filed a protection order earlier this year against him, claiming he had locked her and their young son in the family home and threatened to kill her.

The protection order had barred the violent man from coming close to his ex-girlfriend's home or son's daycare center after the threatening episode.

'After we called cops on him he grabbed our son from me and shoved him into the car,' Ms Arceneaux wrote on the order.

'He then got on his knees in front of the cops and said "I swear to God on all my children I will kill you.'

'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my work looking for me,' she added. 'I am afraid for me and my son's life.'

Lafayette
Police Corporal 
Paul 
Mouton told MailOnline that after her rescue a swat team entered the 
house, and found the 'suspect was deceased' at about 3pm (CST) on 
Friday.

Captain Judice said the victim's family found her after hearing her screams.

'Family members are walking through a pasture with an abandoned home ... and heard a yell from inside the home,' he recalled.

Relatives first told KATC TV-3 that gunfire was 
exchanged between the family and the alleged kidnapper.

'We found my niece Bethany, she's 
OK. I'd like to thank everybody who came out and helped us search,' Marcus Arceneaux said.

'Friends and family actually came 
into contact with the victim and the suspect in or out of the house,' Corporal Mouton told KPEL.

'There was a confrontation at that point. During that 
confrontation, the victim was freed,' he said, adding that Miss Arceneaux was said to be in 'good condition other than some injuries that she had received'.

The couple have a violent history revealed in several police reports, according to KATC 3. She had filed several reports alleging domestic abuse and also filed a restraining order against Thomas.
