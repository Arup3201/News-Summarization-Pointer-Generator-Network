The head of the UN mission to fight Ebola has said he does not have the resources to defeat the disease which is still accelerating in some areas of Africa.

Anthony Banbury said more help is urgently needed as some villages have still received no help, despite significant contributions from the UK, China, Cuba and the US.

He said bed space was still a huge issue but claimed he was hopeful of achieving the target of giving bed space to 70 per cent of patients by December.

The confirmed death toll is now 4,818, according to the World Health Organisation.

Mr Banbury said the disease is still a 'crisis' in many areas while speaking at the UN headquarters for Ebola response in Ghana, which has not been affected by the epidemic.

He said his organisation does not yet have the capacity to defeat the disease. 

'We definitely do not have the response capability on the ground now for the international community to defeat this disease yet,' he said.

The WHO said that in the countries worst affected by the outbreak - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - transmission remained 'persistent and widespread, particularly in the capital cities'.

The UN's Ebola mission chief said that in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, there was a decline but there was 'significant acceleration' elsewhere.

A group of migrants arriving on a Canary Islands nudist beach caused panic among naked holidaymakers yesterday when they reported having symptoms associated with Ebola.

To the shock of nudist holidaymakers, the 19 migrants arrived on the Gran Canaria beach of Maspalomas about 8.30am and were isolated for seven hours while authorities struggled to decide what to do.

Several of the migrants said they were from Sierra Leone and Guinea - two of the most badly affected countries in the current outbreak.

Mr Banbury mentioned contributions from the UK, which opened a new Ebola centre in Sierra Leone on Wednesday.

In Liberia, a 25-bed Ebola centre set up by the US army to treat health care workers was officially opened in Monrovia on Wednesday by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

While attempts to halt its spread have increased in recent weeks, fears remain the virus will continue to run rampant as the United Nations (UN) pleads for the international community to contribute more resources to combat it.

The number of Ebola cases is surging in Sierra Leone as the country suffers from a lack of treatment centres, while lack of food and basic goods is forcing some people to leave quarantine areas, the UN said.

Sierra Leone is emerging as the focal point for concern in the worst Ebola outbreak on record as the number of cases in the country continues to rise, while it stabilises in neighbouring Guinea and slows in Liberia.
