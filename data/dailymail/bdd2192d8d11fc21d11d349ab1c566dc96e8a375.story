Arsenal are making promising progress in their attempts to land Olympiacos defender Kostas Manolas.

Arsene Wenger wants to sign a new defender before the transfer deadline following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

The Gunners’ need for defensive cover has heightened following a hamstring injury to Kieran Gibbs that will rule him out for the next three weeks.

As Sportsmail revealed last Wednesday, Manolas is a strong contender to fill the vacancy left by Vermaelen.

And Arsenal are pushing hard to complete a £6.5million deal by September 1.

The North London club believe Olympiakos will sell their highly-rated defender, who played for Greece during the World Cup.

But doubts linger over whether Manolas is prepared to sign for the Gunners without the guarantee of regular first team football.

Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny - who is nursing an Achilles injury - are Wenger’s first-choice central defensive pairing.

Likewise, new signing Calum Chambers has been excellent at centre-back since his arrival from Southampton.

The level of Manolas’ first-team chances appears to be the key stumbling block towards the completion of a deal.

But the Gunners are growing increasingly confident a deal can be reached.
