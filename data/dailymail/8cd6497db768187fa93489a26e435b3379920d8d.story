Dennis Rodman's close friends have revealed that he was 'plied with alcohol' as soon as he arrived in North Korea.

The details about the booze-filled trip come after the news that the former basketball star has checked into a rehab facility in New Jersey after his return from Pyongyang.

He made no secret of the fact that he was drinking during his second trip to the rogue state, and blamed his screaming fit during an interview with CNN on inebriation.

The recent trip to North Korea, timed 
to coincide with leader Kim Jong Un's birthday, was the former NBA 
star's second to the country and he is treated as a major celebrity 
there.

Upon his arrival
 this time, he was greeted with personalized bottles of vodka that had 
pictures of Rodman and Kim Jong Un drawn on them.

This
 is not the first time that Rodman, 52, has received treatment for his 
addiction to alcohol, having gone through the process in 2008, in 2009 
as part of his time on Celebrity Apprentice and a second time later that
 year as part of the show Celebrity Rehab With Dr Drew.

'In
 all honesty, Dennis, although a very sweet person, is an alcoholic. His
 sickness impacts his ability to get work,' his financial advisor Peggy 
Williams said in 2012.

A source told TMZ he entered the facility a few days ago after returning from his much criticized trip to the insular communist country.

The insider added the former Chicago Bulls star is 'beyond exhausted and overwhelmed' and will receive care for 30 days.

It
 comes hot on the heels of his infamous interview on CNN's New Day show,
 on which he said Kenneth Bae may have done something to deserve his 
sentence of 15 years of hard labor.

He
 claimed alcohol was one of the reasons for his bizarre outburst about 
his fellow American citizen, who was convicted by by the regime on 
charges of planning to overthrow the North Korean government.

He was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, and is the longest-serving United States prisoner of North Korea since the end of the Korean War.

Following a complaint from Mr Bae's family the five-time NBA champion apologized, claiming he was under stress and had been drinking when he was interviewed.
