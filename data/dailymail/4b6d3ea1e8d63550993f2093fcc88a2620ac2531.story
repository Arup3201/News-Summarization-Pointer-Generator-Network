Proudly clutching the Union flag, the crew of the British scallop dredger Van Dijck stand firm in the face of the sabre-rattling French.

Militant French fishermen have threatened to mobilise a 250-strong armada against British boats legally fishing for scallops off the Normandy coast.

They have already attacked the Van Dijck and other British boats with rocks, iron bars and flares in what the crew have called ‘The French Revolution’.

But skipper Gary Smith, 47, says his crew refuse to be intimidated by their Gallic foes.

Speaking
from the wheel cabin of his 100ft boat he said: ‘These boys are 
hardened seafarers and there is nothing more they would like than a 
punch-up with the French.

‘But
I told them we must not retaliate whatever they might throw at us. 
That’s just what the French want. They are trying to goad us into 
fighting back and making us like the bad guys in this. We are not.

‘We
have been fishing for scallops here for years and there is plenty to go
round for all of us, they just want it all for themselves.

‘We have painted a Union Jack on the side of the boat to show we will not be intimidated.’

As the Van Dijck rocks from side to side in the rough waters of the English Channel it is difficult to see what stirs up such emotion. But when the huge mechanical arms at each side of the dredger haul up 14 steel scoops packed with scallops the bounty is there to see.

This is what the French fishermen are willing to ram rivals boats for, and even throw ropes into their propellers. A self-imposed summer ban means the French don’t fish for scallops until October 1. When they returned to the waters they were angry to see how much the British boats had harvested.

Armed with rocks and iron bars they left the beaches of the D-Day landings determined to confront the British boats. Van Dijck crew member Liem Roger, 24, said: ‘They came armed with basketfuls of rocks. The skipper told us not to hit back. He said that is exactly what they want but in the end we had to go into the wheelhouse with the skipper because it was the only place that was safe.’

Steve Joyce, 25, said: ‘The job is hard enough as it is. We are all exhausted trying to make a living but we are determined to stand firm.’

The Norman fishermen have a long track record of using force to get their own way. Ten years ago they believed a British boat called the Jacobi was poaching scallops in French waters.

Up to 100 French fishing boats confronted the Jacobi and a steel cable was thrown into its propellers.

In last week’s confrontation French fishermen also attempted to snag the propellers of the Van Dijck. The evidence – a long blue rope – is displayed on deck. That attack lasted for six hours and ended only with the arrival of a French Navy cutter. However, it cruised past the French to stop amongst the nine British boats to take down their details.

The next day it returned and boarded the British boats to check their papers and that their catch was not oversized and was legal.

The following day another French Navy vessel did the same. Mr Smith, who has 20 years at sea, said: ‘It’s victimisation. They want to do whatever they can to find faults with us and kick us out.’

The French raid began in the early hours of Monday. First mate Daniel Bassett, 27, said: ‘It’s astonishing there was no loss of life. They were firing flares on to one boat, which could easily start a fire.

'The French are being greedy and they want everything to themselves. We won't let them win'

‘The worst thing was, the British didn’t do anything about it despite our calls for help. We were just left to our own devices. We didn’t stand a chance against so many French trawlers, especially when they are backed up by the French Navy.’

British fishing boats are not allowed within 12 miles of the French coast but the Van Dijck and other UK boats have not breached that line.

New quotas mean British boats can fish for scallops for only 36 days in October, November and December, including travelling time, bad weather breaks and mechanical failure.

Mr Smith said: ‘It means we have to make the most of the hours we have. The French are being greedy and they want everything to themselves. We won’t let them win.’
