Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen insists he wants to stay at White Hart Lane this summer, regardless of who the club appoints as manager.

The Spurs centre back has been linked with a host of clubs following Tottenham's failure to qualify for the Champions League, with reports claiming the Belgian international would ask to leave the club had Tim Sherwood been retained as manager.

Despite claiming he would wait for a new manager to be appointed before deciding his future, it now appears Vertonghen is keen to remain in north London.

Staying put: Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen insists he is happy at White Hart Lane and wants to stay

'I’ve got a couple more years at Tottenham and I’m happy, and I want to stay there, so it doesn’t matter who the manager will be,' Vertonghen told Sky Sports.

There is a chance the former Ajax man may be reunited with old boss Frank De Boer, who he played under at the Amsterdam Arena and remains one of the favourites to take the Tottenham hotseat along with Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Asked about the possibility of playing under the former Dutch international once again, Vertonghen said: 'He (de Boer) is a good manager but there are other good managers as well so, again, the chairman will make a good decision.'

However, with the World Cup set to commence in three weeks time, Vertonghen is keen to do well for his country rather than see the tournament as an opportunity to impress fellow suitors on the global stage.

'I don’t think that is one for us because we all play for nice teams already and we just want to do something nice for Belgium, not for ourselves.'
