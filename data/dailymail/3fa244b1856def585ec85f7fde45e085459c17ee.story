A Catholic school worker has won an employment tribunal against her former school after she was fired for appering in a racy music video.

Veronique Bonazzola was sacked from her post at the school in the south of France after she appeared in the rap video as a scantily-clad 'cougar', The Local reports.

The 50-year-old school assistant also worked as a part-time actor and appeared in the video called Fontaine do Jouvence (Fountain of Youth) by the rapper Novia.

Fired: The 50-year-old Catholic school assistant was sacked after appearing in the video

Veronique Bonazzola was sacked from her post at the school in the south of France after she appeared in the rap video as a scantily-clad 'cougar'

She won the 'victory against injustice' against her former employer, Collège Notre Dame de la Tramontane, who fired her after 20 years working as a classroom supervisor.

The video came to light last spring when a group of upset parents complained to the school and showed them the video.

In the clip, a dark-haired Bonazzola is chased by the rapper and dances suggestively with the other women before cosying up to 27-year-old Novia.

The pair then celebrate by pouring champagne down her chest in a Jacuzzi.

Claude Backès, director-general of the Catholic secondary school, said Bonazzola’s activity was 'incompatible with the nature of this person’s work and the rules of the institution'.

Lawyer Pierre Chami said Bonazzola felt upset by the termination of her employment.

'She doesn’t understand why, after 20 
years of good and loyal service, she’s being thrown out like some 
unsavoury character for a video that’s shorter than five minutes,' he 
said.

Bonazzola said: 'When the whole 
affair broke, I got the impression that (the school’s management) were 
going to burn me at the stake in the school yard.'

'They found it scandalous, but most of the parents and students supported me,' she added.Bonazzola sued her school for wrongful termination of her job.

A
court in nearby Grasse ruled in her favour and criticised the school 
for not making clear to Bonazzola how her acting career might affect her
day job.

The school 
'never gave her the slightest warning about any possible threat that 
such activities might pose to her professional obligations,' the court 
said.

The tribunal ruled she was sacked 
'without any real or serious cause' which could shape future cases in 
France where a person's life outside work, beliefs and activities could 
affect an organisation they work for.

Bonazzola,
who is still unemployed, celebrated the verdict in a post on her 
Facebook page, calling it 'a wonderful victory against injustice.'

'The
courts have recognized everyone’s right to do as they please with their
free time, and condemned abusive firings,' she said.

'A
massive big-up to my lawyer Mr. Chami and everyone who showed their 
support. An even larger big-up to everyone who talked crap (about me)!'

The school has decided not to appeal the decision.
