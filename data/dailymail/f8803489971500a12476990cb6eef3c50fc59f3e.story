A 97-year-old grandmother was left clinging to an air conditioning unit for half an hour after she slipped while cleaning windows.

Ukrainian Angela Artyomova was left hanging 35 feet above street level, suspended from the fourth floor, after her topple.

But the spritely pensioner managed to grab hold of an air conditioning unit at her flat at Rivne in the Ukraine after the fall, and then get her foot wedged in the bracket holding it in place.
