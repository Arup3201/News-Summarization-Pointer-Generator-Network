With large exposed wood beams, a wood-burning fireplace , wood-plank floors, large arched windows and an attached glassed-in greenhouse , the home exudes rustic elegance worthy of an A-list movie star.

Director Ryan Murphy used the visually appealing carriage house as a movie set in the beginning of Eat Pray Love, based on Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling nonfiction novel by the same title about the author’s journey of self-discovery following a bitter divorce.

Beside Ms Roberts starring as Liz Gilbert, the film also featured Javier Bardem, Viola Davis and James Franco, with Brad Pitt acting as a producer.

The Cobble Hill mansion’s history goes back to the 1840s, when the 25-foot-wide building was used as a New York City firehouse, Curbed NY reported.

It was later transformed into a two-unit home with three 'loft-like' floors connected by staircases, skylights, and a gourmet kitchen.

The main floor of the residence measures 2,125 square feet and boasts double-height ceilings, while the second floor has a lovely terrace that can easily double as a breakfast nook.

Outside, the carriage house's new owners will be able to enjoy their morning coffee al fresco in a bucolic perennial garden overflowing with greenery.
