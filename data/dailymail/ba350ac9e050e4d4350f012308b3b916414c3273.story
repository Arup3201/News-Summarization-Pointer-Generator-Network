State officers in Texas have arrested a woman after finding the body of 57-year old husband who had been missing for three years.

The Texas Rangers dug up Ervin Robinson’s remains in the front yard of the Pelican Bay rural home where he used to live.

The Rangers had been investigating Robinson’s disappearance since he vanished in May 2010.

Charged: Neola Robinson, 62, is charged in connection with the murder of her husband, Ervin Robinson

Buried: The body of Neola Robinson's husband, Ervin, was found in the front yard of the home where they used to live

Authorities arrested Neola Robinson, 62 on Saturday in connection with her husband’s murder.

She is in Tarrant County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail. She is also on suicide watch and is awaiting a full mental health evaluation.

New information in the case led investigators to the Robinson home over the weekend.

A criminal background check showed Ervin Robinson had several arrests, including burglary, theft and multiple DWIs.

Hidden in plain sight: Ervin had gone missing in May 2010 yet his wife simply told people that he had left her for another woman

Marital troubles: The couple were often heard arguing and had violent episodes but it has still come as shock to many in the community

Neighbors say Texas Rangers surrounded the mobile home on Saturday.

Carolann Wheless, a neighbor, said she is shocked by Neola Robinson's arrest.

'In the front yard of all places -- I mean, how do you get away with something like that?' Ms Wheless said.

Ervin Robinson has been missing since May 2010. His boss, Michael Wright, filed a missing person's report when he didn't show up for work for nearly two weeks.

His boss said he knew something was wrong when Ervin didn't show up for work, or even pick-up his last paycheck.

'Never
missed any time without setting up a vacation or calling in so when he 
didn't show I mean it was very uncharacteristic of him,' said Michael 
Wright, Ervin's boss.

Some neighbors said the couple had a volatile, and at times violent relationship.

Others had suspicions that Neola Robinson might have had something to do with her husband’s disappearance.

'I
actually heard [Neola Robinson] tell someone at a bar, ‘You shouldn’t 
sit by me, I might kill ya.’ She laughed, then everybody pretty much 
just stopped talking to her,' said Lanie Lindsey.

Disbelief: Neighbours cannot believe how a woman who is on disability benefits was able to bury her husbands body in their front yard

Good inentions: Although Ervin Robinson had a lengthy criminal history including robbery and DWI, his friends say he was turning things around. His wife remains in Tarrant County Jail on $150,000 bail

But
Lindsey said the suspicions deepened as Shorty’s friends refused to 
believe he’d leave town without saying goodbye, and without telling his 
boss.

'And get this,' she 
added, 'he left his Harley, his prize possession. He was a biker. Who 
would do that? That’s when people started getting suspicious. If he was 
going to take off, he’d have told someone.'
