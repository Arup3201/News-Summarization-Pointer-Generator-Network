Having graced the cover of Sports 
Illustrated and Vogue and appeared in countless glossy fashion and beauty campaigns, Kate 
Upton knows a thing or two about looking good.

So it comes as no surprise that the supermodel has been snapped up by Gillette to be their glamorous new spokesperson.

As the signing was announced the 22-year-old offered some advice for men wanting to get beach-ready this summer, as well as sharing her own beauty secrets as she posed in a fun summer shoot on a London rooftop.

Looking good! Supermodel Kate Upton has been unveiled as the newest spokesperson for Gillette and has shared her beauty and grooming tips

Speaking about her new campaign, Kate told MailOnline: 'I am one of Gillette’s very first female spokespeople and my role is to help guys understand what women want for body hair styling.

'Spoiler alert, hairier isn’t better, so use a tool that can keep everything trimmed up nicely.'

As we enter sunbathing season and with the high street awash with super short swimming trunks, we asked Kate what she thinks of men like TOWIE's Bobby Norris flashing so much flesh, Kate said: 'I think if you’re bold 
enough to wear something like that then go for it! I think these 
fashions have done wonders for male grooming - guys are taking care of 
their body which I appreciate.'

Kate shared her views on manscaping and whether she prefers a rugged man or a 
more groomed metrosexual, saying: 'I think grooming is really important 
in a guy’s overall look because it says a lot about someone if they care
 about their appearance.

Clothes to match the sky: Kate makes the most of the sunny skies in London by posing on a rooftop for her new campaign, revealing that she has a pretty low-maintenance beauty regime

'I like a 
guy to trim and shave below the neck and guys should definitely care 
about us girls enough to do that...I mean, we groom.'

Kate, who prefers the natural look on herself, also opened up her make-up bag to reveal how she gets that 'low maintenance' glow. She said: 'I love Bobbi Brown mascara and moisturiser so 
those are always in there. I also always use lip balm so I make sure I 
have one with me wherever I go.'

Lending a hand: The 22-year-old has offered a female perspective to help men get beach-ready this summer and says she loves it when men are groomed

Describing her own personal style, she said: 'I would describe it as a combination of laid-back casual, sexy and sophisticated.'

The curvy Vogue cover girl, who is a mouthpiece for positive body image in the industry, says that she's enjoying her time in London and has been squeezing in some sightseeing.

She is also a huge fan of one of Britain's favourite sports; tennis. 'Yeah, I love tennis,' she said. 'My whole family enjoys the game. I wish I could have made it to a match.'

In between working with Gillette and enjoying the sights of London, Kate has just unveiled a new beauty campaign for Bobbi Brown.

Talking about her newest recruit, make-up maestro Bobbi said: 'Kate came to the 
shoot without a stitch of makeup; she is the girl next door, really 
fresh and the epitome of all-American.

'She
 not only represents beauty - although I think all women are beautiful -
 but she has incredibly good energy. She is happy, she is strong, she is
 smart, she is open, and she is really versatile.

'She’s
 starting to act, she’s a model; she speaks eloquently about confidence 
and self-esteem, which is really important to me. I think she’ll be a 
great [role model] for young girls to look up to.'

It's here! Kate Upton was announced as the new 
face of Bobbi Brown cosmetics in March and her new campaign for the Surf
 and Sand collection has now been unveiled

Kate Upton
 first rose to fame after starring on the cover of the Sports Illustrated 2011 swimsuit edition, looking sultry in a 
barely-there red bikini.

She
 appeared on the cover again for its 2013 issue, posing in 
little more than an unzipped arctic jacket, and has featured several 
other times since.

In her interview for American Vogue last month, she opened up about the fine art of emanating just the right amount of sexy.

Starring role: Miss Upton appears in new movie The Other Woman with Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann

I
 definitely have limits,' she said, adding: 'There's a line between 
becoming, you know, a little cheap and cheesy versus being sexy. And I 
try to be very careful of that line.'

Clearly her strategy is working and Miss Upton has been fully embraced by the global Vogue clan.

She first appeared on the Italian Vogue cover in November 2012, 
followed by British Vogue in January 2013 and American Vogue's cover in 
June 2013 - where she was heralded as the 'American Dream Girl.

'I love my body,' Miss Upton declared in the accompanying interview. 'It’s what God gave me.'
