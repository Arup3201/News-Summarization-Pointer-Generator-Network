Hundreds of Eric Garner protesters descended on the Brooklyn's Barclays Center hosting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Monday night in the fifth day of protests.

Star players including LeBron James and Kyrie Irving joined the demonstration by wearing 'I Can't Breathe' shirts as they warm up for a game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Brooklyn Nets.

And pop royalty Jay Z supported the statement by posing for a picture with four Nets players wearing the customized shirts. 

The protest, dubbed #RoyalShutdown, comes almost a week after a grand jury refused to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo for the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner.

Police allegedly used pepper spray as they lined the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York City, while the crowd of protesters wearing tiaras and chanting 'black lives matter' grew in numbers.

A vast portion of the crowd fell to the ground in a staged die-in holding up signs that read 'Who are you protecting?'.  

As a dressed-down Prince William, his five-months-pregnant wife Kate and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver were seated in the stadium after the players concluded their televized warm-up, during which many players wore 'I Can't Breathe' t-shirts.

The words are a reference to Eric Garner's last words as he lay on a New York City sidewalk after being arrested for selling loose cigarettes.

Meanwhile, the Justice League of New York, an activist group, led the crowds in protest. 

The group is demanding that Pantaleo be fired and police chokeholds be made illegal. 

By half time, when the Cavaliers were in the lead, police were sending reinforcements to the Flatbush entrance of the stadium, where crowds were threatening to break through security.

Earlier on Monday, James told ESPN it is an honor to play for the royal couple, who were sat next to former Houston Rockets player Dikembe Motumbo - and across from pop royalty Beyoncé and Jay Z.

'It's a huge honor,' James said. 'The stuff that you read about, people like them are only in books growing up. And to hear that they're coming to town to see me play and they want to see me do what I do best, it's a huge honor.'

Chokehold: One man is seen making reference to the chokehold that killed Eric Garner in July

Connected cases: This protester referenced the Michael Brown shooting with his 'don't shoot' sign. Many claim Brown, 18, had his hands up and shouted 'don't shoot' when he was killed by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson

Protesters shouted 'black lives matter' and 'no justice no peace' during the game on Monday

Message for Kate and Wills: Many of the protesters fashioned signs directed at the Duke and Duchess

Unrest: The protest is one of hundreds that have been staged across the US in the wake of police killings

Kevin Garnett and Deron Williams were among four Nets wearing the shirts before the game in support of the family of Eric Garner, who died July 17 after a police officer placed him in a chokehold when he was being arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.

Chicago star Derrick Rose wore one before a game Saturday and James said Sunday he wanted one. He got it from Nets guard Jarrett Jack, who provided them to players on both teams.

'Obviously as a society we have to do better, we have to have empathy better for one another no matter what race you are, but it's more a shout-out to the family more than anything,' James said before warming up.

Irving had already gone to the court in his as James spoke. James said at the time it was a 'possibility' he would do the same, and he was wearing the shirt when he unzipped his yellow and gray jacket in the layup line.

Rampage: At one point the protesters ran with their signs to storm Target across the street before returning

Freezing: The marching crowds braved the cold temperatures to make their stand

James and Irving were two of six players wearing the t-shirts. They are contractually bound to wear Adidas

'I respect Derrick Rose and all of our players for voicing their personal views on important issues but my preference would be for players to abide by our oncourt attire rules,' Silver said.

Players are required to wear attire of Adidas, the league's official apparel provider. 

Irving also said his thoughts were with Garner's family.

'What happened is a tragedy, I feel terrible about it, but my emotions are just more or less condolences for the family,' Irving said.
