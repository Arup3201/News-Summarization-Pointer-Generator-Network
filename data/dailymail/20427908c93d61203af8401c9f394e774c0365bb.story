Andrew Toseland (pictured) is now in an induced coma after telling partying yobs outside his flat to be quiet in the early hours of the morning

A man was beaten unconscious after he asked a group of loud yobs who were plaguing his cancer-stricken mother to be quiet in the early hours of the morning.

Andrew Toseland, 49, is now in an induced coma in hospital as the result of the serious head injuries he suffered in the attack.

The 6ft 2in-tall warehouse worker had walked out of the flat he shares with his mother at 1am after hearing the revellers in a communal area.

He asked them to calm down and leave 
the building in Gosport, Hampshire, as they didn’t live there and was 
subjected to a brutal attack.

His
mother Nina Toseland, 78, today said she had returned home that evening
having been to hospital for cancer radiotherapy treatment.

She said: 'Andrew thought I was staying at the hospital overnight, so had gone out for a drink with his brother Robert.

'I
went to bed at about 11.30pm, and I heard him come back with his 
brother, but then I heard this commotion outside - shouting and 
swearing.

'I came out into the living room to tell Andrew to phone the police, but the front door was open.

'Then I saw Robert, and he said: "Don’t 
go around the corner. Don’t look at Andrew. I’ve put him in the recovery
position and he’s seriously hurt".'

'Andrew was making a horrible noise. The three who had set on him had run.

'Andrew is such a quiet person 
usually. I think he had politely told them to leave because they 
shouldn’t be in the building - they definitely weren’t people who lived 
here.'

His brother Robert also received a black eye during the attack.

Andrew was taken by ambulance to Queen Alexandra Hospital, but was later transferred to the neurological specialist unit in Southampton General Hospital.

Mrs Toseland, who is a great-grandmother, said: 'One of Andrew’s pupils is fixed and dilated.

'We’ve been warned that he could be left with brain damage.'

Eight people have been arrested so far as part of the investigation into the attack.

Men aged 25, 27 and 21 were questioned on suspicion of wounding with intent causing Actual Bodily Harm (ABH), and have been released on bail until October.

Two men aged 18, one aged 20 and a boy of 16 are currently in custody on suspicion of the same offence.

A woman of 22 is also in custody on suspicion of assisting an offender. All suspects are from Gosport.
