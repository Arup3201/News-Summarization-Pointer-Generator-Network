France has been ordered to pay thousands in compensation Somali pirates who had attacked French ships, because the pirates' human rights were disregarded when they were arrested. 

The French army took too long to bring the pirates before a judge when they apprehended the sea-faring criminals in 2008, the European Court of Human Rights ruled.

France now has to pay between 5,000 and 2,000 euros (£3,945, and £1,578) to each pirate for 'moral damages'.

They were also ordered to pay amounts varying from 9,000 euros to 3,000 euros (£7,100 to £2,367) to cover the pirates' legal costs.

The ECHR said French authorities should have presented the pirates 'without delay' to a judge when they arrived on the country's territory after holding the men at sea.

The Somali pirates were apprehended on the high seas by the French army on two separate occasions in 2008, and taken back to France for trial.

In the ruling, the ECHR acknowledged the French were operating under 'completely exceptional circumstances' -  the arrest took place'more than 4,000 miles from French territory - which explained the long detention without seeing a judge.

The ECHR, located in Strasbourg, eastern France, also noted that the Somali authorities were 'incapable of fighting' against the pirates.

Nevertheless, the court ruled that after their arrival on French soil, authorities were wrong to keep the pirates in custody for an additional 48 hours before bringing them before a judge.

'Nothing justifies such an additional delay,' read the ECHR verdict.

This constituted a 'violation of their rights to freedom and security,' the court ruled. 

Pirate attacks off Somalia have been slashed in recent years, with international fleets patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, as well as armed guards being posted aboard many vessels.

At their peak in January 2011, Somali pirates held 736 hostages and 32 boats, some onshore and others on their vessels.
