Up to 100 Tory MPs are set to defy David Cameron by pledging to vote to leave the EU no matter how much power he manages to claw back from Brussels.

Conservative Eurosceptics are planning to promise in their personal manifestos for next May’s General Election that they will vote for Britain to quit the EU in 2017’s in/out referendum.

Such a move would be widely seen as a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to win a good deal for Britain.

And it would echo the warning by Douglas Carswell, the former Tory MP who defected to Ukip last week, that Mr Cameron was not ‘serious’ about EU reform and wanted to recommend an ‘in’ vote.

The newly elected president of the European Council, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, said at the weekend that he would support key reforms demanded by Mr Cameron, including a crackdown on benefit tourism.

But that would not be enough for the 50 to 100 Tory MPs planning to bring out the rebellious manifestos, according to Eurosceptic MPs speaking to the Independent.

Mark Reckless, MP for Rochester and Strood, said: ‘My election manifesto will confirm my view that we should leave the EU.’

Meanwhile, a senior Tory says the party should not even try to contest the seat where Carswell is standing next month.

Nigel Evans, the former deputy speaker, yesterday urged his party to ‘sit out’ the by-election in Clacton where the former Conservative MP, will now run for Ukip.

It comes as up to three leading Tory Eurosceptics are reported to have started private talks about ‘non-aggression pacts’ in which Ukip would not run against them.

The by-election, which a poll this weekend suggests Mr Carswell will win by a landslide, presents a severe dilemma for the Conservatives.

Ploughing resources into keeping the seat would be expensive and some fear it would divert resources from other key seats to what could be a high-profile failure.

Mr Evans, who described himself as ‘sort of’ a friend of Mr Carswell, told Sky News: ‘A part of me says we should sit this one out, it’s a total distraction.’

Michael Fabricant (left), a former Tory chairman who used to organise by-election campaigning, said it was his party’s ‘duty’ to fight every by-election seriously; Nigel Evans (right), the former deputy speaker, yesterday urged his party to ‘sit out’ the by-election in Clacton

He added: ‘I spent the day yesterday with 250 young Tories who feel desperately let down by Carswell. They do believe the only way we’re going to make headway is by having a referendum on Europe.

‘How are we going to do that? With the Tories and David Cameron winning in 2015. It really makes no sense to me at all.’

But Michael Fabricant, a former Tory chairman who used to organise by-election campaigning, said it was his party’s ‘duty’ to fight every by-election seriously.

He proposed deals between the Conservatives and Ukip two years ago, but said the idea was no longer viable as many of Ukip’s policies, such as cuts to the NHS budget, ‘contradicted’ Conservative policies.

He said: ‘We can’t say we are not going to fight it. We have to fight every by-election seriously. Conservative voters in Clacton will expect a serious campaign and we cannot disenfranchise them.’

It was claimed yesterday that MPs who want to cut ties with Brussels but are not prepared to join Ukip will defy Mr Cameron by forming their own ‘non-aggression pacts’ with the party.

This could involve stripping their campaign literature of Tory logos and using quotes from Mr Farage on pamphlets — effectively running as joint candidates, the Sunday Times said.
