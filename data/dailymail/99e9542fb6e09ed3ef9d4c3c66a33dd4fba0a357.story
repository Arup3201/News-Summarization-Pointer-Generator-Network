Devastated: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her California home last month

Tapes of the frantic 911 call made by 
Leila Fowler's step-mother on the day that the eight-year-old was 
allegedly murdered by her brother have been released.

Leila's father's girlfriend wasn't home at the time of the attack but she was the person to place a call with emergency services.

In a recording released Tuesday, she can be heard calling 911 and saying that the children, 
including Leila Fowler, were OK.

'My children are at home alone and a man just ran out of our house. My 
older son was in the bathroom and my daughter started screaming. He came
out and a man was in the house,' the panicked caller says in the call 
made April 27.

'They said they're OK.'

She added, 'My daughter is freaking out right now.'

In fact, Leila Fowler was dying of stab wounds.

Leila's brother has since been arrested and charged with second-degree murder with special circumstances for using a dangerous weapon in the crime.

On Tuesday, attorney Mark Reichel admitted the youngster 
might have lied about seeing a long-haired man fleeing the scene, but 
that doesn't make the boy the killer.

He said his client might have made up a 'macho' story about scaring away the intruder because he was scared.

Reichel said that after visiting with the boy, he and law partner Steve 
Plesser met with the family and toured the hillside home where the 
stabbing took place. Reichel declined to say what they spoke about.

'They're all doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances, and the circumstances are not good,' Reichel said.

The boy was expected to make his first court appearance on Wednesday, but his name has not been released since he is a minor.

"How does a 12-year-old commit the perfect crime?" said Reichel, whose 
firm was part of a team that two years ago successfully defended members
of the Hmong community, including former Gen. Vang Pao, against charges
they plotted to overthrow the government of Laos.

Reichel declined to comment on the emotional state of the boy or his family.

'They're going through a very difficult time,' he said.

Leila's father Barney Fowler spoke briefly on Monday and said, 'Until they have
the proper evidence to show it's my son, we're standing behind him. If 
they have the evidence, well that's another story. We're an honest 
family.'

The boy told investigators on April 
27 that he encountered a random attacker in the family home while his 
father was attending a Little League game. He described the man as tall 
with long gray hair.

The boy said the man fled on foot and he found his sister, Leila Fowler, bleeding.

Leila's death set off an intense manhunt in the rural community where some residents had moved to escape big city crime.

The Calaveras County Sheriff's Office spent more than 2,000 man-hours amassing evidence and searching door-to-door.

Residents
of the rural community began locking their doors and calling 
authorities when they thought they saw men who fit the description.

They also held fundraisers for the Fowler family and turned out by the thousands for a candlelight vigil in Leila's honor.

'We're thankful to the community and all they've done for my daughter,' Mr Fowler said.

He
echoed comments made earlier on Monday by his son, Justin Fowler, 19, 
who said the family was in shock and extremely sad about the boy's 
arrest.

Justin said the 
family is 'in a fog' over the boy's arrest that has rocked the 
community of Valley Springs.

The
arrested boy had appeared at a vigil for his sister on April 30, along with 
brother Justin, who was photographed with the name 'Leila' written on 
his forearm.

Calaveras Unified School District made counselors available on Monday at all schools.

Police released no information about 
what led them to arrest the unidentified 12-year-old for the April 27 
attack.

Following the crime, investigators 
did a door-to-door sweep of 
homes, storage sheds and horse stables scattered across the oak-studded 
foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Divers also searched two nearby 
reservoirs in search of clues.

A neighbor told detectives she saw a man flee the home 
but she later recanted the story.

Police said there was no sign of a 
burglary or robbery. As part of the investigation, authorities seized 
several knives from the Fowler home, where Leila lived with her father, 
stepmother and siblings.

Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz 
said authorities spent more than 2,000 hours on the investigation before
they arrested the boy at 5:10 p.m. Saturday

Leila's brother was taken into custody at 5:10 p.m. Saturday and police hastily called a news conference to announce the arrest.

‘Citizens of Calaveras County, you can sleep a little better tonight,’ Kuntz said.

Authorities spent over 2,000 hours on
the investigation ‘to provide Leila Fowler's family answers to her 
death,’ the sheriff said.

Kuntz said at the time the investigation was ongoing. He declined to provide further details.

Several days after the killing, 
hundreds of people gathered at Jenny Lind Elementary School where Leila 
was a popular 3rd grader. Her mother, Krystal Walters, tearfully thanked
the crowd for the support.

The April 27 attack on Leila Fowler shook the tightknit Valley Springs community of about 7,400 people and set off a massive manhunt

‘I just want to thank the entire 
community and all of our family and friends for all the overwhelming 
amount of support you've given our family,’ Walters said at the time. 
‘It will never be forgotten. Thank you.’

Calaveras County Deputy Coroner Steve
Moore said the girl died from multiple stab wounds. They have not 
revealed how many times she was stabbed or where.

Violent crime is so rare in the 
community of 7,400 people that even law enforcement officers have to 
stop and think when asked about the last time there was a stranger 
killing in the area.

'Probably five years ago was the last one I can remember,' said Officer 
Rebecca Myers of the California Highway Patrol, who was assigned to 
block access to the neighborhood of one-acre ranchettes.
