Donkey milk and horse oil are having a renaissance as South Korea's hottest new skincare ingredients - and they are already making their way to into US products.

The beauty savvy country, which introduced American women to BB and CC creams and ten-step skincare routines, is on its way to making the unlikely animal-based ingredients the next big thing.  

Alicia Yoon, a Harvard Business School graduate and co-founder of Korean beauty site Peach and Lily, told New York Magazine that she sees donkey milk and horse oil as the newest trends in Korean skincare.

Ms Yoon explained that donkey milk 'is known to be gentle and soothing for those with sensitive skin and eczema, and [has] four to five times more vitamin C than cow’s milk and [is] rich in proteins'.

She also said that horse oil is 'featured front and center' at some of the flagship locations of Olive Young, a popular beauty supply store in Seoul.

'Chinese tourists have come to love this product,' she said. 'Horse oil is known to sterilize and also renowned for its absorbent properties.'

When asked how Korean skincare differs from American skincare, Ms Yoon said Korean products often contain more 'niche and adventurous' ingredients because Korean women tend to be more willing to experiment.  

'I find that the major beauty brands are careful about launching anything too zany because, perhaps historically, American women would rather stick to more known ingredients like retinol and vitamin C,' she explained.

But donkey milk and horse oil aren't the only bizarre beauty ingredients to come out of South Korea. 

The country helped turn snail slime into a must-have skincare product.

In 2010, Korean brand Missha launched Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream, which contains 70per cent snail extract. The mollusk mucus is said to clear acne, heal scars and beat wrinkles, and it has been reported that Katie Holmes uses a cream containing the slime.

Korean face masks containing pig collagen have also gained popularity.

Holika Holika's Pig Collagen Jelly Pack is certificated by the Korea Food and Drug Administration and created using 70,000ml of collagen extracted from pig skin, which promises to erase wrinkles and give tired-looking skin a youthful glow.

These products may seem strange, but Ms Yoon pointed out that Korean skincare 'tends to include more natural ingredients and formulations because of the rich history of using ingredients found in nature'.

For example, donkey milk and horse oil have been touted for their cosmetic uses throughout history.

Cleopatra was said to have taken daily baths in the milk of more than 700 lactating asses.

While American beauty connoisseurs have to search Amazon and eBay for foreign skincare products containing horse oil, a donkey milk cleaner is already available in major US department stores, including Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom.   

Napoleon Perdis Auto Pilot Hydrating Milk Cleanser features lactation-by-donkey and retails for $69.

Australian make-up artist Napoleon Perdis told Refinery 29 last August that the facial product from his eponymous line was inspired by an ancient beauty regimen. 

'After learning Egyptian queen Cleopatra had reportedly bathed in donkey milk for its youth-enhancing effects, my team and I did some research into the benefits,' he said. 'We discovered that, due to its vitamin-rich composition, it was perfectly suited to the face.'
