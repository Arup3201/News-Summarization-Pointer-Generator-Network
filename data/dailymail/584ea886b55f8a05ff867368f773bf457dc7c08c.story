An Australian icebreaker carrying passengers saved from a ship pinned tight by Antarctic sea ice halted its journey home today amid fears that a Chinese ship involved in the rescue is now also icebound.

The Aurora Australis had been cracking through thick ice toward open sea after a Chinese helicopter yesterday plucked the passengers from a stranded Russian research ship and carried them aboard.

But today, the crew of the Xue Long (Snow Dragon), the Chinese icebreaker that had provided the helicopter, said they were worried about their own ship's ability to escape the ice.

Role reversal: The Chinese ship Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which had gone to rescue passengers stuck in an icebound research vessel, is now itself stuck in the heavy Antarctic sea ice

Complex operation: The Xue Long (Snow Dragon) 
Chinese icebreaker, as seen from Australia's Antarctic supply ship the 
Aurora Australis, sits in an ice pack unable to make its way back to open water

The end is in sight: The first of the 52 passengers on a research ship trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week were finally rescued by helicopter after several aborted attempts to evacuate them

The helicopter carried the passengers a dozen at a time over approximately five hours

Sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, so the passengers are instead being taken to an nice floe next to an Australian vessel which will eventually take them to Tasmania

The Aurora was told to stay in the 
area in case the Snow Dragon needs help, according to the Australian 
Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Co-ordination Centre, which oversaw 
the rescue.

She had been 
about to embark on a journey to drop off the 52 scientists and tourists 
rescued from research vessel MV Akademik Shokalski at the Australian 
island state of Tasmania.

The
 Snow Dragon, which is at the edge of the ice pack surrounding the 
Akademik Shokalski, will attempt to push through the ice to open water 
early tomorrow, when tidal conditions are expected to be most 
favourable.

The Aurora is waiting around seven miles north of the Snow Dragon, said Lisa Martin, spokesman for the marine authority.

Authorities
 have not said what the next step would be if the Snow Dragon became 
stuck, but it is possible that the Aurora could attempt to break through
 the ice to help the Chinese vessel.

The
 maritime authority said there was no immediate danger to anyone aboard 
the Snow Dragon and that the decision to keep the Aurora on standby was 
just a precaution. But it was yet another problem to hit the highly 
complex rescue operation of those on board the Akademik Shokalskiy, 
which got stuck in the ice on Christmas Eve.

A
 spot of clear weather yesterday finally allowed the multinational 
rescue operation after blinding snow, strong winds and thick sea ice 
forced rescuers to turn back time and again.

The
 twin-rotor helicopter, based on the Snow Dragon, took seven hours to 
carry the scientists and tourists in groups of 12 from the Russian ship 
to the Aurora. Earlier, the passengers had linked arms and stamped out a
 landing site in the snow next to the Russian ship for the helicopter.

Helicopter
 pilot Jia Shuliang told China's official Xinhua News Agency that he had
 no way of knowing whether the ice could withstand the helicopter's 
weight.

The rescue came in the never-ending daylight of summer after days of failed attempts to reach the vessel.

'I
 think everyone is relieved and excited to be going on to the Australian
 icebreaker and then home,' expedition leader Chris Turney said by 
satellite phone from the Antarctic.

Sydney
 resident Joanne Sim, a paying passenger, wept as she boarded the 
Australian icebreaker. She said the passengers had spent their time 
watching films and playing games.

'It
 really has been an emotional rollercoaster,' she told a reporter from 
The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper who is aboard the ship.

The
 22 crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy stayed with the icebound 
vessel, which is not in any danger and has enough supplies on board to 
last for weeks. They will wait until the ice surrounding the ship breaks
 up, which could take several weeks, ASMA Emergency Response Division 
manager John Young said.

The
 cost of the rescue would be carried by the owners of the ships and 
their insurers, in accordance with international conventions on sea 
rescues, Mr Young said.

Any official inquiry into how the ship got stuck would have to be conducted by Russia, he said.

The
 Akademik Shokalskiy, which left New Zealand on November 28, got stuck 
after a blizzard pushed the sea ice around the ship, freezing it in 
place about 1,700 miles south of Hobart, Tasmania.

The
 scientific team on board the Russian vessel had been recreating 
Australian explorer Douglas Mawson's 1911 to 1913 voyage to Antarctica.
