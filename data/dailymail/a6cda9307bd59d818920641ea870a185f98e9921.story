Families are spending more money on petrol than the weekly food shop, a report will reveal.

With fuel prices rocketing to record levels, more drivers are being forced to scrimp on other household necessities so they can afford to get where they need to be.

The AA, who complied tomorrow's report, said prices at the pump hit a record high of 142.48p a litre for petrol this week, while diesel hovers around its peak of 147.88p.

Expensive: Families who have two cars are having to pay £22 more to fill them up than they did at the beginning of the year

It means that to fill up a 50-litre family car would cost about £71.24, while the average weekly food bill is £70.10, said the motorist group.

Families who have two cars are having to pay £22 more to fill them up than they did at the beginning of the year.

It has been a tough few weeks for drivers since the tanker drivers threatened to strike over pay and conditions.

Even though the strike didn't happen, many families rushed to the pumps to fill up over Easter, stretching their household budgets further.

Edmund King, president of the AA, said fears over forecourts closure had put families under 'intolerable strain', adding: 'Panic buying in March forced some cash-strapped families to spend far 
more on fuel than their budgets could bear.

'Filling up a
50-litre tank costs more than some families spend on food each week.'

Buy yesterday a fuel crisis seemed back on the cards after tanker drivers rejected a proposed deal, raising fresh threats of strikes which would cripple petrol supplies.

Around 60 Unite officials overwhelmingly turned down a deal which was thrashed out during six days of talks between the union and representatives of six fuel distribution companies.

The union, which represents 2,000 drivers, urged motorists not to panic buy and stressed that it had not yet decided whether to name any strike dates.

The union only has until Friday to call a strike and will have to give seven days notice of industrial action.

Northern Ireland has the most expensive petrol at 143.9p per litre while Wales hit 142.9p per litre. 
Yorkshire and Scotland are the cheapest at about 142.2p per 
litre.

The AA blamed 'stock market speculators' for manipulating prices and called on the Government to 'address the destructive tendencies in
the oil and road fuel markets'.
