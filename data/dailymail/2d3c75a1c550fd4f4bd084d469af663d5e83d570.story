It is the most hated guitar in folk music history.

But the Fender Stratocaster that Bob Dylan brought on stage on the night he 'went electric' has allegedly been found in a dusty attic bolthole after 47 years in hiding.

And even after nearly five decades away from the public eye, it appears the instrument is still a slave to controversy after a row broke out between a TV show and Dylan himself over who actually possesses the original.

Booed off: Dylan was met with cries of 'Judas' when he launched into Maggie's Farm at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25 1965, backed by a full rock band

If the authentic 'Dylan goes 
electric' guitar ever went on the open marketplace, experts say it could
fetch as much as a half million dollars.

Now American prime-time hit The History Detectives say the New Jersey daughter of a pilot who flew Dylan to appearances in the 1960s found the guitar in a family attic.

They have billed the guitar as the centrepiece of next
Tuesday's season premiere of PBS' History Detectives, and the show said
it stood by its conclusion that Dawn Peterson, has the 
right instrument.

But a lawyer for Dylan claims the 
singer still has the Fender with the sunburst design that 
he used during one of the most memorable performances of his career.

Claims: Dawn Peterson, left, said Dylan left the Fender behind on an airplane and her father took it home.

'This is not just kinda cool. This is
way cool,' said guitar expert Andy Babiuk. 'We all love Bob Dylan, but 
this is really a pinnacle point not just in his career but for music in 
general.

'I don't think music in the 1960s would have been the same if Dylan had not gone electric.'

Quinto briefly flew music stars like Dylan, The Band and Peter, Paul 
& Mary around during the 1960s. Dawn Peterson, his daughter, said Dylan 
left the Fender behind on an airplane and Quinto took it home.

With his acoustic songs of social protest, a young Bob Dylan was a hero to folk music fans in the early 1960s and the Newport festival was their Mecca.

But he was met with cries of 'Judas' when he launched into Maggie's Farm on stage on July 25 1965, backed by a full rock 'n' roll band.

Bringing an electric guitar and band with him on-stage was more than an artistic change, it was a provocative act.

Most folk purists hated rock 'n' roll.

What happened next is a little foggy.

Did an enraged Pete Seeger really try to cut Dylan's electric power?

Was the crowd upset about the noise, or by Dylan leaving the stage after only three songs to a chorus of boos?

Was it even upset at all?

He later returned for a couple of acoustic songs.

Either way, Dylan never looked back.

She was told that her father contacted Dylan's representatives to get them to pick it up, but no one ever did. Quinto died at age 41, when his daughter was 8, and she treasures any remaining connection to her dad. The guitar was in her parents' attic until about 10 years ago when she took it.

Peterson had no idea about its history until a friend of her husband's saw it and mentioned the possible Newport connection. After unsuccessfully trying to verify it on her own, she turned to 'History Detectives' about a year ago for help.

'When I heard it, I was like, "Yeah, right,"' said Elyse Luray, a former Christie's auction house appraiser and auctioneer who co-hosts the PBS show.

But there were intriguing clues.

Peterson's father left behind an address book that included a phone number for 'Bob Dylan, Woodstock.'

Luray showed the guitar case to a former Dylan roadie who recognized the name of a little-known company that Dylan had formed at the time stenciled on its side.

A sheaf of papers with handwritten song lyrics was in the guitar case and PBS took them to an expert, Jeff Gold, who said the handwriting matched Dylan's.

The fragmentary lyrics later appeared, in part, on songs that Dylan recorded but rejected for his 1966 'Blonde on Blonde' album.

Luray took the guitar to Babiuk, an appraiser of instruments who consults for the rock hall.

He took the guitar apart to find a date written inside (1964) that made its use in Newport plausible.

He drew upon blown-up color photos from Newport to compare the wood grain on the guitar Dylan played that day to the one in his hands.

He's confident it's a match, likening the wood grain to a fingerprint.

Dylan's lawyer, Orin Snyder, said late Wednesday that the singer had the guitar.

'He did own several other Stratocaster guitars that were stolen from him around that time, as were some handwritten lyrics,' Snyder said. 'In addition, Bob recalls driving to the Newport Folk Festival, along with two of his friends, not flying.'

In a response, 'History Detectives' spokesman Eddie Ward said the show continues to believe Peterson has the guitar in question and would 'welcome the opportunity' to examine the guitar that Dylan says is the one he played that day.
