An Italian doctor has laid bare the country's wasteful public sector after being permitted to work for just 15 days in the past nine years.

The unnamed medic, 50, has used a series of reasons to shirk his duties in the casualty department of a hospital near Catania, Sicily, since 2005.

These include attending three and five-year university training courses, calling in sick, taking paid leave for 'family' reasons and obtaining a doctorate.

Now, he is the subject of an inquiry at the hospital after being cited as the latest example of how thousands of Italian civil servants are able to avoid work by finding loopholes in the rules.

Speaking of the doctor's time off, Sicilian 
paper Giornale di Siracusa said: 'We are all paying for this, from
 his training courses to his illnesses, to his family leave.

However, the medic said he was ‘perplexed’ by the public outcry, adding, ‘Everything I did was legal and proper.

'Even the hospital confirms I have 
acted correctly. Going on courses is normal and I am being punished for 
developing my understanding.'

The doctor first disappeared off on a reportedly taxpayer-funded university course after starting work in 2005, before returning to the hospital three years later, on October 31, 2008.

He then immediately obtained paid family leave until May 2009, according to The Telegraph.

After starting back at work, he lasted 15 days before calling in sick until July 2009. He then obtained a place on another university course lasting until June this year.

He is now reportedly planning to stay off work until December 2016 to complete a phD, said ANSA.

The case highlights Italy's notoriously wasteful public sector, with a staggering 26,000 people hired as forestry workers in Sicily alone, more than in British Columbia in Canada.

Hospital director Franco Luca admitted that the doctor's absences were allowed within the rules.

But he added that he hoped the inquiry would help to reduce time off that was 'not strictly necessary or indispensable'.
