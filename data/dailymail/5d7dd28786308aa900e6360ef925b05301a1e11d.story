George Osborne yesterday put ‘silver savers’ at the heart of the Tory campaign for next year’s  general election.

As well as giving big tax breaks to the thrifty, his Budget heralded the most radical reform of pensions for a century.

Workers nearing retirement will be allowed to transform their private pension pots into bank accounts.

With no need to take out an annuity, pensioners will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like. The Chancellor’s move follows MoneyMail’s campaign to expose the dismal payouts that annuity providers offer.

He also unveiled ‘pensioner bonds’ with generous rates for savers aged over 65, announced a £15,000-a-year ‘super ISA’ and abolished the 10p starting rate of tax on savings income. Other key measures include:

The ‘Blue Rinse Budget’ – staunchly Conservative and aimed squarely at the party’s traditional supporters – offered relief to those Mr Osborne said had ‘worked hard and saved hard all their lives and done the right thing’.

It was a transparently political statement appealing to middle-aged and older voters who are much more likely to turn out in next year’s election and have been squeezed for years by record low interest rates.

It was also calculated to bring older Tory voters who are flirting with UKIP back into the fold; almost two thirds of those who say they may vote for the anti-EU party are over 55.

The centrepiece of the Budget was what the Chancellor described as the most far-reaching change to private pensions since 1921.

It will remove the restriction on the amount of money the 13million people in defined contribution pension schemes can take out of their pension pot.

They will no longer face a current ‘punitive’ 55 per cent tax rate – which prompts most people to buy an annuity – and will instead be taxed at normal marginal rates.

The cash they withdraw can be used to invest in property, clear debts or spend – just like savings in a regular bank account.

The shock announcement wiped £4.5billion off the value of pension firms, which have been criticised for their opaque fees and poor value products.

The Chancellor unveiled a further series of measures to show the Government has what has been dubbed ‘Essex appeal’.

Pitched at the kind of blue collar voters who once backed Margaret Thatcher, they included a penny off a pint, a freeze on duty for spirits and cider, tax cuts for most long-haul holiday flights and a halving of tax on bingo.

For those in work, Mr Osborne announced a further increase in the starting rate of income tax to £10,500 – meaning 24million basic rate taxpayers will be £800 a year better off by the time of the election. Childcare subsidies worth up to £2,000 a year per child will be given to dual-earner couples.

The Chancellor shunned calls from Tory MPs for a significant hike in the threshold for the higher 40p rate paid by middle class professionals, pulling 400,000 more into the bracket.

His fifth Budget was set against the biggest economic upgrade in 30 years.

The independent Office of Budget Responsibility said the economy was on course to grow by 2.7 per cent in 2014 compared with the 1.8 per cent it forecast only a year ago.

Though austerity measures would have to continue way beyond the next election, Mr Osborne said the economy was recovering faster than expected and it was time for people to start to be rewarded for holding their nerve.

‘The message from this Budget is: you have earned it; you have saved it; and this government is on your side. Whether you’re on a low or middle income, Whether you’re saving for your home, for your family or for your retirement. We’re backing a Britain that saves,’ the Chancellor told cheering Tory MPs.

Mr Osborne said the ‘economy was continuing to recover and recovering faster than forecast’.But he cautioned that the job was far from done, adding: ‘Our country still borrows too much, we still don’t invest enough, export enough or save enough. This is a Budget for building a resilient economy. 

‘If you are a maker, a doer or a saver, this budget is for you.’

The huge budget deficit will be down ‘by a half’ in the coming year but remains ‘one of the highest in the world’.

The Chancellor insisted the Government would balance the books within four years, running a surplus of around £5billion or 0.8 per cent by 2018-19 – years after this was originally planned.

The Budget statement appeared to leave Ed Miliband floundering in the Commons, focusing his criticism of the Government on the cut in top rate of tax to 45p announced two years ago.

The Labour leader offered little response to any of the measures announced by Mr Osborne, and shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said later that he did not immediately oppose any of them.

The Shadow Chancellor did suggest that the Chancellor’s pension reforms could eventually lead to a big fall in tax receipts. He said they would initially generate extra revenues as more people took money out of pension pots, before becoming a cost to the Exchequer in the 2030s.

Mr Balls said Mr Miliband had a ‘difficult’ time but suggested it was because he had been distracted during the Chancellor’s statement by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles falling asleep.

Mr Pickles denied doing so, though he said it would have been a ‘blessed release’ to have slept through Mr Miliband’s ‘lacklustre’ response.

Around £4billion was wiped off the value of the UK’s biggest pensions firms yesterday after the Chancellor announced radical reforms to give more choice to savers when they retire.

George Osborne said savers would be allowed to draw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire.

But fears the overhaul will lead to a slump in sales of pension annuities spooked investors and triggered a rout on the stock markets.

Last night consumer campaigners described it as a ‘wake-up call’ for insurance companies, which have been accused of making huge profits from selling poor-value pensions for many years.

The share price of insurance giant Legal & General fell by more than 8 per cent, reducing its value by £1.1billion. Shares in Aviva, the UK’s biggest seller of annuities, fell by more than 5 per cent, equating to a drop of almost £800million.

But the biggest casualties were Partnership and Just Retirement, which specialise in selling annuities to savers suffering ill health. Although they have been credited with providing a better deal than mainstream insurers, their share price plunged 55 per cent and 42 per cent respectively because they are so reliant on annuity sales.

In total, around £4billion was wiped off the value of five of the biggest sellers of pensions annuities – Aviva, Legal & General, Prudential, Partnership and Phoenix.

Pensions campaigner and former Downing Street adviser Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘This is a wake-up call. Insurers have brought this on themselves.

‘They will have to make sure annuities are good value?…?and will not be able to allow savers to roll over into poor-value pensions when they retire. The easy pickings they have had in the past will be few and far between.’

Legislation forcing savers to buy an annuity at the age of 75 has already been scrapped and experts believe the Chancellor’s reforms will make annuities much less appealing.

Ben Cohen, of analysts Canaccord Genuity, said: ‘The reason why you see a massive reaction in the market is  investors think firms like Partnership will disappear. 

‘I think there will still be a market for annuities. But it’s difficult to see how companies which don’t have another string to their bow will survive.’

Peter Hargreaves, of financial firm Hargreaves Landsown, said: ‘Insurance companies had a captive audience, meaning savers got a lousy deal and they made huge profits. These days are coming to an end.’

Otto Thoresen, of the Association of British Insurers, said the changes  were a ‘significant challenge for everyone involved in helping people secure their retirement income’.
