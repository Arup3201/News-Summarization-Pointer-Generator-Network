Wanted: Psychiatric patient Raymond Morillo walked out of the secure unit after swapping clothes with a friend visiting him

A convicted killer has walked out of a psychiatric hospital after evading security by exchanging clothes with a friend who was visiting him.

Police have now launched a major manhunt for Raymond Morillo, 33, who was jailed in 1999 for manslaughter.

He had been a patient in Creedmoor Psychiatric Center on Winchester Boulevard in Queens Village, until vanishing on Tuesday about 11.30am, according to police.

His friend also managed to walk out of the secure facility wearing Morillo's hospital uniform, it is understood.

Morillo, describe him as 5ft11ins tall, 215lbs, is a convicted felon and has a teardrop tattoo under his left eye.

As well as the manslaughter conviction, Morillo has a number of assault charges to his name, dating from 1998.

In December, a judge ordered he be transferred to the psychiatric centre in New York.

On the secure hospital's website, the 
institution is described as providing 'a continuum of inpatient, 
outpatient and related psychiatric services with inpatient 
hospitalization at the main campus and five outpatient sites in the 
borough of Queens'.

Treatment: Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, pictured, in New York provides treatment for individuals with 'illnesses that have become so severe that they are unable to function in the community'

It adds: 'Inpatient treatment at Creedmoor is reserved for individuals with illnesses that have become so severe that they are unable to function in the community.'

The unit admits patients 'who have severe psychiatric illnesses requiring intermediate and long–term care'.

Anyone with information on the man’s whereabouts, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS or www.nypdcrimestoppers.com.
