Some restaurant owners have tired of their negative Yelp reviews and are fighting back at their unhappy customers, seasoning their retorts with a dash of name-calling and a sprinkle of insults. 

Francesco Macri, who owns Park Italian Gourmet Deli in Manhattan, isn't afraid to call his customers douchebags or tell them they're 'full of s***'. 

Yelp user Scott E. awarded the deli one star after he  asked the owner why they stopped serving breakfast at 10am and said he was told 'not to come back'.

Macri wrote back that he remembered Scott was 'not kind at all' and that he wasn't worried 'because if you came back, I'd kick you out again'.

Macri is even happy to lob insults in different languages. When Joe T. said that as an 'Italian from Brooklyn' he knew this was 'not a good place to eat,' Macri wrote in Italian 'you are such an idiot...you're in Brooklyn, please'

When Karl K. complained on the site that the sandwich he had shared with a friend had 'no complexity,' Macri told him there was an 'overall douche-baggery to your review'. 

Macri said he was 'ultimately content' that Karl didn't have a good experience, and quipped 'I haven't shared a sandwich with anyone since I was maybe six years old'.

After vegetarian Salman M. complained about the deli's 'restricted' options and said the price was too high, Macri responded that he was 'full of s**t*', adding that he was 'not sure if that's considered vegetarian or not'.

But the owner's comebacks aren't always insult-packed. 

When one reviewer wrote she was disappointed with the deli after hearing good things, he responded with a link to the music video for Public Enemy's song Don't Believe The Hype. 

Macri told the New York Post that he wasn't 'a nice person' and that he was just defending his business from 'a public complaints department'.

Although the deli owner may be one of the most active restaurant owners when it comes to responding to negative Yelp reviews, he's hardly the only one. 

When one Yelp user accused Gaia Bagnasacco, owner of Gaia Italian Cafe in New York, of having a 'horrible attitude' she called him out on what she said was his 'nasty' behavior. 

Bagnasacco told Peter B., who had previously given her a five-star rating before the new two-star post, that the restaurant was tired of his attitude.

'We have been patience [sic] in the past many time,' she wrote. 'Is [sic] not fair Peter and we are sure you will find the right place for you. Ciao.' 

In another response Bagnasacco wondered where all the 'educated' customers who 'understand quality' had gone.  

But sometimes, when the customer takes it too far, the restaurant owners are unafraid to give more than a strong-worded response.

‘Shout out to these two winners for seating themselves with no reservations, insulting and berating our staff, refusing to leave and all the while yelping away in front of us as a means of threat,' he wrote. 

He included the hashtag 'WeDoNotNegotiateWithYelpers'. 

Some Yelpers have been left scared to share their opinions after a few businesses skipped angry responses or shaming posts and jumped straight into the courtroom.

Last year a Virginia woman was found guilty of defaming a contractor on the site after she wrote a review that he had mishandled her home renovation and stolen her jewelry on the job, according to Yahoo News.  

The woman was being sued for $750,000 but ended up not having to pay a dime when the jury found the contractor likewise defamed her when he responded to her allegations. 

California has been the first state to protect users, creating the Yelp law. The legislation prohibits companies from using online reviews as a means for fining customers, according to CNN. 

The law bans protective 'disparagement clauses' and states that companies who try to enforce a fine for a negative review could be forced to pay anywhere from $2,500 to $15,000.
