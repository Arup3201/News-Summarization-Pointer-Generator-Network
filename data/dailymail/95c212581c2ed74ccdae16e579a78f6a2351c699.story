Estate: Amy Winehouse left behind a fortune worth almost £3million following her death last year

Amy Winehouse left behind a £3million fortune following her death last year, it has been revealed.

The singer, who was 27, had an estate worth £4,257,580, which was reduced to £2,944,554 after paid debts and taxes.

The full amount will go to Amy's parents Mitch and Janis Winehouse, as the Rehab singer did not make a will.

Her father Mitch is the administrator of her estate, according to newly-released probate documents.

Amy's former husband Blake Fielder-Civil will not receive any of the estate.

Winehouse passed away in July last year from alcohol poisoning at her flat in Camden, with an inquest recording a verdict of misadventure.

She had fought a lengthy battle with drugs and alcohol addiction.

Meanwhile fans of the Grammy-winner took to Twitter last night to voice their disapproval over Mitch Winehouse, 60, appearing on Channel 4 show Four Rooms to sell one of his daughter's dresses, despite the proceeds going to charity.

Mitch hoped to raise money for the charity Hopes And Dreams by selling an autographed frock worn by the singer at a concert in Brazil in January 2011.

In the family: with no will, the money will be left to her parents Mitch and Janis Winehouse

'Not overtly comfortable with Mitch Winehouse going on #FourRooms to sell Amy's dress. Just not right,' one fan tweeted.

Another wrote: 'Mitch Winehouse just sold Amy's dress on Four Rooms channel Four. Why not the ashes Mitch? #sick'

One tweeter hit back: 'Love people claiming Mitch Winehouse is "flogging his dead daughters dress" when she had already donated it to charity. Listen you idiots.'

For charity: Amy autographed the frock, which she wore at a concert in Rio de Janeiro in January 2011, with the intention of it going to charity

Winehouse defended his actions in a statement on his own Twitter feed: 'Regarding the auction dress on 4 rooms on channel 4 tonight.

'Amy gave that dress to Hopes and Dreams charity 9 months before she passed away. It is not our dress. I was asked to help with negotiations.

'So we are not selling Amy's dress. But we will sell others to raise money for kids that need help.'

Hitting back: Mitch defended his actions, saying he was simply carrying out his daughter's wishes
