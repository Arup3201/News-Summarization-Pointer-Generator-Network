A top Australian scientist has complained that basic classroom maths just doesn't add up.

Australia's chief scientist Professor Ian Chubb said the subject is irrelevant and doesn’t prepare students for the workplace.

He argued that this 'disconnect' needed to be investigated thoroughly as basic maths techniques like interpreting data, basic calculations and using graphs were not being applied properly in the workplace.

Basic classroom maths does not prepare students for the workplace it has been argued by Australia's chief scientist Professor Ian Chubb

The issue needs to be investigated thoroughly as basic maths techniques were not being applied properly in the workplace

News.com.au reported that a new study, conducted by the Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers, the Australian Industry Group and the Office of the Chief Scientist, examined 12 workplaces including engineering, drafting, manufacturing, retail, mining and defence.

Prof Chubb said as maths was at the core of many careers, the study had implications for individuals as well as workplaces. The study recommended that school-based research should look at how to help classroom maths reflect what is needed outside of the classroom.

It was also advised that the Australian Curriculum directed schools in how to transfer maths skills to the workplace.

Basic mathematics content in the national curriculum could be taught through a range of contexts

There should be an emphasis on the 'real life' application of maths, Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers chief executive officer Will Morony said.

'Unless we in schools take particular actions to help students transfer their skills, students won’t be successful in the workplace,' he said.

'Otherwise we will still have this disconnect between the classroom and from what the workplace needs.'

A new study examined 12 workplaces including engineering, drafting, manufacturing, retail, mining and defence, and how beneficial maths that is being taught in the classroom really is 

Basic mathematics content in the national curriculum could be taught through a range of contexts, a spokesman for the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority said.

He confirmed that individual schools are best placed to determine how maths content is taught in their school, and how best for them to meet the needs of their students in their local situation. 

'State and territory education authorities would provide advice to assist schools in implementation,' he said.
