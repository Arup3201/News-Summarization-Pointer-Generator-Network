Libyan revolutionary fighters are surrounding an area where a fugitive son of Muammar Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam, is believed to have taken refuge.

Rebel fighters said they were deploying south of the town of Bani Walid to an area where they believed Saif al-Islam was hiding after his flight from his father’s hometown of Sirte on Thursday.

Bani Walid, 100 miles south-west of Tripoli, fell to revolutionary forces earlier this month after soldiers loyal to Gaddafi put up determined resistance for  several weeks.

Saif al-Islam was widely reported to have been based in the town during its resistance, before moving to Sirte.

National Transitional Council 
official Abdel Majid Mlegta said Gaddafi’s Niger-based security chief 
Abdullah al-Senussi had been in contact with Saif al-Islam to try to 
help him escape to the neighbouring country, ‘but our brigades are 
encircling this area south of Bani Walid’.

There had been various reports of 
Saif's condition following the death of his father, with some reports 
that he had been shot, and even some claims that he had lost both arms.

However,
 a National Transitional Council spokesman told NBC on Saturday that Saif
 and Moussa Ibrahim, the former media frontman for the Gaddafi's regime,
 were captured in Nessma, near Bani Walid, while they were being moved 
to Misrata. That report has yet to be confirmed.

And conflicting
 reports emerged yesterday claiming that Saif he had already been 
captured in Zlitan, 99 miles from Tripoli, while receiving treatment for
 wounds.

No pictures have emerged of Saif since his father was captured and killed on Thursday.

Any escape will worry the 
British political elite who could face acute embarrassment if Saif was 
ultimately captured and ended up in court. 

Saif became close to leading figures 
in the British government after Tony Blair signed the notorious ‘Deal in
 the Desert’ in March 2004.

Prince
 Andrew has also been linked to the bomber’s controversial release.

The 
Duke of York was accused of holding secret ‘detailed discussions’ over 
the release of the Lockerbie bomber with Saif in 2009, during an 
official Foreign Office-sponsored trip to Algeria.

There had been news of his apparent escape earlier on Saturday, with reports of him fleeing across the vast Libyan desert towards Niger from the carnage of Sirte, revealed by Abdul Majid Mlegta, a senior military commander of the interim NTC.

His statement came after a day of 
rumour and conflicting reports in Tripoli that had seen Saif, 39, 
variously killed, fighting for his life in hospital and being held in 
custody.

In the hours after the deaths of 
Gaddafi and another son Mutassim, 34 – who had been in charge of Sirte’s
 defences – it was said Saif had been critically wounded when his convoy
 was hit by an RAF bombing raid.

Saif is thought to be trying to join 
up with another brother Saadi, 38, who fled to Niger in September 
together with other Gaddafi allies and a fortune in gold and U.S. 
dollars.

Mohammed, 41. Status - fled: The only child from Gaddafi's first wife,
 Mohammed was head of the Libyan Olympic committee and chairman of the 
General Post and Telecom Company which operated the country's mobile 
phone and satellite communications networks. He fled to Algeria after the 
fall of Tripoli.

Saif al-Islam, 39. Status - wounded: Gaddafi's eldest son from his second 
wife, Saif Al-Islam was the dictator's favourite and one-time heir 
apparent. Educated in London and Vienna, he was a notorious playboy. 
Rebels claimed to have captured him during the fall of Tripoli but he 
escaped the capital. Yesterday,
 the NTC initially said Saif fled Sirte in a convoy heading for the 
desert, but then announced he was shot in the leg by revolutionary 
fighters and taken to hospital. There are fresh claims he has been captured. He is wanted by the International 
Criminal Court for crimes against humanity

In an indication that Niger may become
 a rallying point for the family, Mlegta revealed that in recent days 
Gaddafi’s security chief Abdullah  al-Senussi, was believed to have 
‘slipped into hiding’ in the country.  

Senussi is Gaddafi’s brother-in-law 
and wanted for crimes against humanity on an international arrest 
warrant from the war crimes tribunal.

Ten days ago both Saadi and Saif were
 said to have tried to strike a deal with the NTC that would have 
allowed Gaddafi to leave Sirte – an offer emphatically  rejected.

Officials said last night that Saif 
was believed to have been with his father in Sirte and to have somehow 
escaped amid the confusion after the convoy fleeing west was twice 
attacked by Nato drones and warplanes. 

Saadi, 38. Status - fled: A former footballer who played in Italy's
 Serie A league, he ran Libya's football federation and invested 
millions of pounds in the country's fledgling film industry. He fled to 
Niger in September.

Hannibal, 36. Status - fled: Violent and abusive, Hannibal was accused
 of beating his pregnant girlfriend in Paris in 2005 and was arrested 
for assaulting two servants in a Geneva hotel, but ran back to Libya 
after being released on bail. He ran Libya's General National Maritime 
Transport Company, which controlled the country's oil exports. He fled 
to Algeria with brother Mohammed in August.

Mutassim, 34. Status - killed: A lieutenant colonel in the Libyan army, 
Mutassim fled to Egypt after masterminding a failed coup against his 
father. He was forgiven and returned to Gaddafi's side as his national 
security adviser. Killed in the assault on Sirte, according to NTC 
officials, although conflicting reports claim he was captured alive.

Fatiha, age unknown. Status - unknown:

Gaddafi's first marriage to school teacher Fatiha al-Nuri lasted less than a year.

She reputedly never met Gaddafi until the day of their wedding.

The couple had one son, Mohammed, but separated after six months and little is known of Gaddafi's first wife after their divorce in 1970.

Yesterday Nato officials released details of it role in possibly the last strikes of the eight-month civil war.

It said planes had hit 11 vehicles in 
an armoured convoy speeding the late Libyan leader out of Sirte on 
Thursday, although Nato did not know Gaddafi was in the convoy.

The account suggested Gaddafi’s 
fleeing convoy was considerably larger, and more vehicles were hit, than
 previously reported.         

Nato aircraft struck 11 pro-Gaddafi 
vehicles that were part of a larger group of approximately 75 vehicles 
near Sirte, the statement said.

‘The vehicles were carrying a 
substantial amount of weapons and ammunition posing a significant threat
 to the local civilian population. The convoy was engaged by a Nato 
aircraft to reduce the threat.’

Ayesha, 34. Status - fled: Nicknamed the Claudia Schiffer of North 
Africa, Gaddafi's glamorous blonde daughter led rallies of her father's 
supporters in Tripoli. The Western-educated lawyer was part of Saddam 
Hussein's defence team. She fled to Algeria with her mother Safiyah and 
brothers Mohammed and Hannibal in August, and gave birth days later.

Saif al-Arab, 29. Status - dead: Playboy Saif Al-Arab was arrested twice 
in Germany for an attack on a nightclub bouncer and for excessive noise 
from his Ferrari F430, while studying in Munich. Charges were dropped as
 prosecutors ruled trial was not in the national interest. He was killed in a 
Nato airstrike on the Gaddafi compound in April.

The statement said that at the time of
 the strike, Nato did not know that Gaddafi was in the convoy, 
reiterating that it was not Nato’s policy to target individuals.   

Last night, Admiral Jim Stavridis, 
Nato’s top commander, said he was recommending the end of the alliance’s
 Libya mission calling it ‘a good day for Nato. A great day for the 
people of Libya’.

And Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh
 Rasmussen said a preliminary decision had been made to end the air 
operation on October 31.

In
 August, as Tripoli fell to rebel forces and after a day of bloody 
street battles in the Libyan capital, Saif boasted of victory.

Despite
 having been reported captured and under arrest, he appeared outside a 
Tripoli hotel to make a defiant speech, declaring: ‘We have broken the 
backbone of the rebels. It was a trap. We gave them a hard time, so we 
are winning.’

Gaddafi’s 
other children have all fled the country or been killed or captured 
during the civil war. It is not known where either of his two wives are.

Khamis, 28. Status - dead: Gaddafi's youngest son led his own feared
 army unit, the Khamis Brigade, which was infamous for torture and 
intimidation. He was killed in fighting during the fall of Tripoli

Safiyah, 60s. Status - fled: Nurse Safiyah Farkash al-Baraasi met Gaddafi when he had his appendix removed in 1969 and the couple were
 married for 40 years. She is the mother of seven of his eight 
biological children, and the couple also adopted two children, a son and
 a daughter. Shopaholic Safiyah was reputed to have used Gaddafi's 
private jet for shopping trips to Europe, and owned airline Buraq Air. 
Her personal wealth has been estimated at £19billion, including 20 tons 
of gold. She fled to Algeria with Gaddafi's daughter Ayesha in August.

Hana, mid-20s. Status - unknown: Gaddafi said his adopted daughter was killed in a 1986 U.S. air strike, but in August it emerged she may have lived and become a doctor
