A hen called Ping Pong laid a one-in-a-billion perfectly round egg - which has now sold on eBay for £480.

Owner Kim Broughton, 44, from Latchingdon in Essex, was left shell shocked after her prize Buff Orpington hen laid the spherical egg on Pancake Day.

Ms Broughton and Ping Pong decided to auction the egg off on eBay and were amazed when it sold for £480.

She is planning to donate the money to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust after a friend's son died from the disease.

Owner Kim Broughton (pictured) was left shell shocked after her prize Buff Orpington hen, which has now been re-named Ping Pong, laid the 'one-in-a-billion' perfectly spherical egg last month

Ms Broughton, 44, said she thinks the winning bidder will probably preserve the unusual egg, rather than eat it. 

The perfectly spherical egg attracted 64 bids during the online auction.

Ms Broughton said she had been tempted to cook and eat the egg before being told it was 'one-in-a-billion'.

She said: 'I was literally about to crack it open to make a pancake when a mate saw the photo I put on Facebook and messaged me to say 'Don't do it!'

'Apparently somebody had sold one before for more than £90 so I thought "Great if I can sell if for that".

'When it was at £20 I thought 'Who'd pay that for an egg?' and then it went through the roof - it's unbelievable,' she told BBC Essex.
