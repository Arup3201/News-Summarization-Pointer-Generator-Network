If there's one word to sum up Julien Macdonald it's fabulous (it is his favourite after all).

Just like the Welsh-born designer himself, his dazzling SS15 collection befit the word perfectly, too. 

This is a man, after all, who has crystal balls in his kitchen and dresses best pals Abbey Clancy and Millie Mackintosh in gowns dripping with sequins. 

Julien, who has this year alone dressed Beyonce, Megan Fox and Emma Watson, sent his stellar roll call of models, including Alex Wek and Hollie-May Saker (Cara D, who?) down the runway in red-carpet worthy gowns.

Here comes the bride (and Julien!): Mr Macdonald unveiled a covetable collection (as always) before a star-studded crowd in the Royal Opera House this afternoon 

His show today was, however, a departure from the usual feast of glitter and glamour. The Strictly Come Dancing star instead focused his attention on creating figure-hugging shift dresses with dropped hemlines (a recurring theme so far this weekend) in buttermilk, yellow, moss green, duck egg blue and off white.

However, the king of Bling didn't shun his favourite embellishment completely. There was a smattering of mini dresses sprinkled with shimmering palettes, chiffon dresses in oyster with sparkling silver mesh; backless pieces with sweeping trains and sheer cut-out sections revealing a glimpse of (beglittered) skin beneath.

Red carpet worthy: The Welsh designer, who took his inspiration from a mermaid, will no doubt have his frow friends on the phone requesting his designs after today's show

Marriage material: Fancy getting hitched in style? Julien can help. 'This time we had two wedding dresses in the show,' he told us. 'The first one was very short, the second one was very long. Obviously they were covered in diamonds, lots of glitter and lots of glamour'

The long and (very) short of it: As well as dazzling gowns, there were a few cheeky derrière exposing pieces perfect for partying in Ibiza next summer 

Speaking about the inspiration behind his collection, Julien told MailOnline: 'The woman is a very special woman, she's a mermaid, she's a woman of the sea. She's a siren who swims in a tropical ocean that's glistening in the moonlight and full of tropical fish. She's surrounded by buried treasure and glamorous things.'

But his mermaid is, in his own words, obviously no ordinary mermaid. 'She falls in love and lures a tattooed gorgeous man into the sea and it's all about an underwater love of a mermaid surrounded by tattooed men, hence the flowers, the prints and the inspiration,' he explained.

The stand-out pieces (if we really had to choose) were two wedding dresses - a first for the popular designer.

Leading ladies: Mary Charteris, Abbey Clancy, Laura Whitmore and Millie Mackintosh held fort on the front row 

Welsh wonder: The vibrant designer, who won over the nation on Strictly Come Dancing, said he wants every woman to wear his pieces

However, looking this good comes at a price - the second wedding dress, a floor-length finale gown covered with real diamonds, pearls and French Chantilly lace, was worth an eye-watering £3m. 

The beauty look complimented the collection perfectly and industry heavyweight Val Garland created the look using L'oreal Paris - only the best for Julien.

Val, who wore a hilarious badge emblazoned with the words 'Bossy B****', described the look as 'glamorous, beautiful make-up.'

She created a metallic smokey eye using L'Oreal ParisColor Riche mono eyeshadow in Gold Mania across the eye with Little Gold Dress dabbed into the corners. There was no liner and no mascara but she brushed a little bit of gold shadow into the brows. 'It's all about washes of colour across the eyes, it's very wearable,' she told us backstage.

Bridal beauty: James Pecis created the  hair, which was slicked back hair using gel (a recurring theme so far backstage this season). As for Macdonald's two brides, Pecis said: 'We wanted something very modern and strikingly different'

She also aimed to create 'beautiful moist skin' with a little help from Nude Magique Eau de Teint and opted for a subtle apricot lip.

Nails, filed and painted by Jenny Draper and her team, were subtle and wearable. 'We used Gris Eternal, a soft, muted shade with a little touch of white to complement lighter complexion tones,' explained Jenny. 

James Pecis created the mermaid hair, which was slicked back hair using gel (a recurring theme so far backstage this season). He used texturiser through the lengths and secured it at the nape of the neck with a needle and thread.

As for Macdonald's two brides, Pecis said: 'We wanted something very modern and strikingly different.' 

For the stars of the show he braided the lengths around the nape of the neck and attached delicate sections of lace to the crown with double stick tape. 

Despite filling his front row with London's style elite (Millie Mackintosh, Abbey Clancy, Rosie Fortescue and Nina Nesbitt), Julien says he didn't have a muse this season. 

'There's no muse, I just celebrate all different women from all different backgrounds and as long as a woman embodies the clothes and the femininity, she definitely loves Julien Macdonald!'.
