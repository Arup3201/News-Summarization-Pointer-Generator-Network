A kind-hearted charity boss had his life 'torn apart' after he was conned and falsely accused of rape by a man who pretended to be a vulnerable 17-year-old.

Will Clark, founder of the award-winning charity Rainbow Rooms UK, spent several weeks trying to help Shane Peake who claimed to have been thrown out by his family for being gay.

The 26-year-old was put in temporary lodgings with carers after he went to Wiltshire Council. Mr Clark's Salisbury-based charity Rainbow Rooms UK also provided him with additional support.

But Peake, who said his name was Steven Shaw, stole from those who took him in and 'destroyed' the life of mentor Mr Clark by falsely accusing him of rape.

Peake, who had claimed to be a poor teenager from South Yorkshire, has now been jailed for four and a half years.

Mr Clark's organisation supported gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender young people.

But the 43-year-old grew suspicious about Peake’s story and questioned him about his background and situation.

Peake then went to the authorities and accused Mr Clark of rape, Salisbury Crown Court heard.

Detectives investigating the allegation uncovered a number of aliases used by Peake and he was arrested. He had also stolen from his carers and Mr Clark, it was revealed.

He admitted theft, burglary, fraud and perverting the course of justice.

Mr Clark, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, said his life fell apart ‘beyond repair’ following the fake rape claims.

He became depressed and ended up in hospital following an overdose.

Mr Clark ran the award-winning charity Rainbow Rooms UK for six years

Mr Clark, who lives with his partner of 17 years, said: 'I was destroyed. I was devastated and I couldn’t believe what was being said about me.

'I went to pieces, mentally and physically.'

Police told him within days that no evidence had been found to support the rape claim and no charges would be brought against him.

But Mr Clark still faced an agonising three-month wait for Peake’s case to come to court and the facts to be made public.

He was forced to close down the award-winning charity he had devoted years to building up and says the sentence doesn’t end his ordeal.

Mr Clark, who ran the charity for six years, said: 'I couldn’t believe people when they said they didn’t believe the rape allegation.

'I didn’t want anyone near me. I couldn’t bear to be around people and I couldn’t bear anyone touching me.

'Everything felt dirty. It wasn’t rational - but I wasn’t rational. It is hard to believe that anyone can do something like this to another person.

'I used to give people the benefit of the doubt but I can’t do that any more. I get panic attacks when I’m in large groups of people and I can’t be alone in a one-to-one situation with someone without thinking about what they might say about me.

'I have no confidence in myself and I have no trust in other people. I’m simply not the same person that I was before.'

He added: 'I went to court because I thought it might give me some form of closure. But it wasn’t like that.

'I used to give people the benefit of the
doubt but I can’t do that any more. I get panic attacks when I’m in 
large groups of people and I can’t be alone in a one-to-one situation 
with someone without thinking about what they might say about me'

'I had to hear it all again and go through it all again.'

Mr Clark, who is on medication for depression and is seeing a counsellor, says he cannot see the charity re-opening.

He said: 'Everything was tarnished by what he said I did. He has destroyed not just my reputation but the reputation of the charity.

'Everything the charity was and all it did in the community has gone. It is such a huge loss.'

Detective Constable Cat Isaac of Wiltshire Police said: 'This case has had a massive impact on Will Clark. His life has been torn apart by Peake’s actions.

'We hope all those people who were deceived by Peake and have suffered as a consequence will be reassured by the sentence.'

Wiltshire Council said they take every precaution when dealing with vulnerable young people and those involved in their care are always trained and vetted.

A spokesman said: 'Firstly, we need to highlight this is a very unusual set of circumstances.

'Wiltshire Council’s priority is to ensure the most vulnerable in our communities are protected.

'Our duty is to offer young adults supported lodgings, which is assessed and run by people who have had safeguarding training and are experienced in supporting those in difficult situations.'
