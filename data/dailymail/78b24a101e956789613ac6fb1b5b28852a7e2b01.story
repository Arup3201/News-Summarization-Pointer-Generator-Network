A pub landlord who is in charge of a scheme promoting safe drinking has been banned from the roads after being caught drink-driving while delivering a takeaway.

Peter Lyon, who runs The Nelson Tavern in Mudeford near Christchurch, Dorset, was delivering Thai food from his pub to a customer when he was stopped by police because of a broken indicator on July 21.

However, the 67-year-old, who is the head of a local Pubwatch initiative in the town, failed a roadside breath test and was arrested after being found to be nearly twice the legal drink-drive limit.

He had 59mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - almost double the 35mg legal limit – and later admitted to having had two glasses of strong beer prior to getting behind the wheel.

He was handed a 12-month driving ban and ordered to pay more than £500 in costs after admitting drink-driving when he appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on Friday. 

The landlord has now offered to resign from his role as the chairman of Christchurch Pubwatch - which promotes safe drinking - but his fate will not be decided until the group's next meeting in September.

He said the incident was a 'moment of madness', describing it as 'unfortunate'.

He said: 'I most definitely do not condone drink-driving - this was an unfortunate set of circumstances.

'I was annoyed with my staff for taking the order, they hadn't taken it correctly. I just got in the car to do the delivery not even thinking.

'Normally I wouldn't have a drink until I had done all my deliveries.

'It was me who put the key in the ignition and I should have thought about it more carefully.

'I have volunteered my resignation to Pubwatch and what they decide is entirely up to them.'

The court heard how Lyon had drunk two glasses of strong beer before getting in his car to deliver a last-minute takeaway order.

Justin Shale, mitigating, said Lyon suffered from oesophagitis and Crohn's disease and had not eaten properly for the previous two days, which meant the beer had more of an effect.

He said: 'He wasn't expecting to drive that evening.

'The circumstances are that he was working in The Nelson restaurant and there was a call at the last minute for a delivery to be made.

Lyon was banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to may more than £500 in fines and costs after being found to be nearly twice the legal limit when he was stopped near Christchurch in Dorset on July 21

'He volunteered to drive, not thinking he would be above the limit.'

Lyon was ordered to pay a £425 fine, £85 in costs and a £43 victim surcharge.

Despite being disqualified from driving for 12 months, he can have the ban reduced by 91 days if he completes a drink-driving course.
