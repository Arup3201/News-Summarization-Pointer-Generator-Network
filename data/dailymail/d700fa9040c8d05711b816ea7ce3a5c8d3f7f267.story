Manuel Pellegrini admitted Manchester City had been outclassed by Lionel Messi after they crashed out of the Champions League against Barcelona.

Ivan Rakitic’s 31st-minute strike was enough to secure a 1-0 victory and ease Barcelona into the quarter-final of the European Cup with a 3-1 aggregate win. 

Sergio Aguero had a penalty saved in the 78th minute, but the reality is that Barcelona threatened to humiliate the Barclays Premier League champions.

Pellegrini, who admitted that talks will take place on his future at the end of the season, said: ‘Messi was imperious - at the moment we have to accept Barcelona are better.

‘It is not a failure, it is a disappointment. We have been unlucky to play Barcelona for two years in a row. We have had a restriction on the number of players we can use in the Champions League.'

'It is very difficult to beat Barcelona, but the statistics I don’t care about. ‘We cannot analyse what we will do next season because it is too soon after this result. We can do that later.

‘It is not easy to play Barcelona. This is the draw, they are very strong. At least we have improved.’ 

Pellegrini has been beaten four times by Barcelona since becoming City manager and he now has nine games to save his job at the Etihad Stadium.

The City chief claims the heavy Christmas fixture schedule is the reason behind the failure of a single English team to reach the quarter-final of the competition.

Pellegrini added: ‘It is difficult to analyse because the Premier League is strong, with money and very good players.

‘We play so many games in December and January and we are not fresh in February. In Spain, Italy and Germany they stop playing. Last year we played nine games in December and nine in January, and that was before we played Barcelona.'

City keeper Joe Hart was easily their best player and it was his immense contribution that prevented Barcelona adding to Rakitic's opener.

Hart, who saved Lionel Messi's penalty in the first leg, said: 'We've gone out to a magnificent side, but that's the second time in two years which is disappointing for us.

'They're going to get a lot of plaudits for how they play, they've got fantastic players, but we had a big chance, we hung on in there and we had a big chance but unfortunately we couldn't take it.

'I suppose you could say they had a chance to finish us off in the first game and they didn't take it but that's how football goes.'

Hart made a string of impressive saves, especially in the second half, and midfielder James Milner was full of praise for his team-mate's performance.

'There are not too many words you can say,' Milner said. 'It's incredible really.

'He's showed again what a great keeper he is and it's not the first time he's done that for us in Europe. He gave us that chance with the penalty (in the first leg). They could have been out of sight by then and he gave us a chance to still be in it.

'He was amazing tonight and deserves everything that gets said about him.'

Hart added: 'It was busy. I just tried to smother them as best I could because I know full well they're thinking they've got to pass at all times.

'I tried to rush him for the goal, I thought he took it well. From there my job is to rush them, with quality players it's difficult to do sometimes, and I got a bit of luck on my side.

'I don't know how Neymar's stayed out in the first minute but that's football. We did our best to stay in it and were just unfortunate tonight.'
