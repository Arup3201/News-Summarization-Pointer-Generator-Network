Players union chief Gordon Taylor has welcomed the Football League's review into the under-representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in coaching and management.

Huddersfield's Chris Powell and Carlisle boss Keith Curle are the only non-white managers in the English professional game.

This imbalance has been a source of debate for a number of years and Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association, recently spoke of 'a hidden racism which holds clubs back'.

Taylor has also highlighted how this under-representation extends to general coaching positions throughout the game, while around 20-25 per cent of professional players are not white.

The Football League has now discussed this matter and pledged to work towards a solution.

Taylor said: 'I am delighted with the news and am very encouraged.

'There will be a lot of people very pleased and I hope we can keep the momentum going.

'At the start of this season we didn't have one black manager out of 92, so it needs addressing.

'I wouldn't say I'm counting my chickens yet but I am encouraged that we can keep the momentum going with this staying on football's agenda.'

The League has said it will be open-minded about potential solutions but Taylor advocates an equivalent of American football's 'Rooney Rule', which would compel clubs to interview at least one black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) candidate for management jobs.

The NFL employs the Rooney Rule to address the issue of a lack of coaches from minority backgrounds

The Rooney Rule has been used in the NFL since 2003 to ensure ethnic minority candidates are adequately represented in the interview process for head-coaching positions.

NFL franchises must interview at least one black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) for management jobs.  

Taylor, whose organisation supports players wishing to move into coaching or management, has also grown frustrated at what he sees as a lack of transparency in clubs' recruitment processes.

He said: 'Of course it (Rooney Rule) is the way forward and at the moment that is all we are asking.

'But if they want to talk about quotas that is fine, if they want to talk about lists of players who are readily available we can.

'We want the recruitment process to be more professional, more transparent and more inclusive, and to be a fair reflection of the number of players coming through on the field of play.

'If our members are going to go through the qualification process, at great cost to them and us, then we want a transparent policy.

'The current ad-hoc policy is so 'rotating door' and is costing the game millions.'

The League announced it was setting up the review following a recommendation by chairman Greg Clarke.

Its terms of reference will be set at its next meeting on November 6 with a report and recommendations due by the end of the season.

Football League chairman Greg Clarke is also keen on addressing the lack of non-white managers

It intends to consult widely with member clubs, other leagues, the Football Association, League Managers Association, Football Supporters Federation and Kick It Out, as well as the PFA, among the bodies to be asked for input.

Clarke said: 'The current under-representation of BAME managers and coaches in the professional game is an important matter.

'We have consistently recognised the imbalance in representation at first-team manager level but have yet to see a comprehensive solution being proposed.

'It is a complex issue that needs a careful and thoughtful appraisal of the current situation in English professional football.

'This will include collecting and analysing data on BAME representation at all levels of the coach development pipeline, from opportunities for individuals to acquire their coaching qualifications through to appointments at first-team level.

'The Rooney Rule has been suggested by some as a potential way forward, however until we have consulted fully with all parties we will remain open-minded about any potential solutions.

'The real challenge is to increase BAME representation at all levels of the coaching pipeline and to ensure that there is fair access to employment opportunities for everyone.

'To this end, the Football League is already actively participating in the FA chairman's England commission which is urgently seeking to address existing issues relating to coaching development, including BAME participation.'
