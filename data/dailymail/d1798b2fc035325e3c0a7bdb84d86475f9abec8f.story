Whether you’re waiting in line for the new iPhone or camping in the woods, sometimes you just need a makeshift bed.

So to help you get 40 winks without having to make do with the cold hard ground, one company has designed a wearable futon you can carry with you.

The coat-like bed is full of padding so you can rest easily on the floor, and it can also be rolled up like a sleeping bag.

Tokyo-based office company King Jim has created a wearable futon. The Wearable Futon Air Mat Set can switch between 'coat' and 'bed' (shown) functions. When going to bed the padding provides a 'comfortable' sleeping place. A supplied air mat can also provide additional padding when on the floor

The somewhat bizarre Wearable Futon Air Mat Set was created by Tokyo-based Japanese office supply manufacturer King Jim.

It can be fastened at the neck and the bottoms of the legs fold up to adjust for different heights.

The 'futon' is one-size fits all as the sleeves can be rolled up to different sizes

This can also change the fit of the ‘coat’ depending on the season.

The pack includes an air mat to provide a full blanket and futon set so you don't necessarily have to sleep on the ground with the wearable futon by itself

While the main coat-futon can roll up into a sack like a sleeping bag, the air mat can be folded into a small A4-sized bag.

The sleeves and legs can also be folded up so that you don't trip over yourself while you are walking around with it in 'coat mode'. 

The product itself is made of nylone, polyethylene and polyester.

In total the coat weighs about 1.5lbs (700g), which should make it relatively easy for most to wear and carry.

In size it measures 5.25ft (1.6 metres) long and two feet (0.6 metres) wide, while the air mat is 9.45ft (2.88 metres) long and 2.3 ft (0.7 metres) wide. 

That should be comfortable enough for most people, but if someone wants to share your ‘bed’ they’ll probably need a Wearable Futon Air Mat Set of their own.

The mat can take a load of up to 440lbs (200kg) without breaking.

The product is available now for about £25 ($40) from supplier King Jim, although there's no news of a release in other territories yet.
