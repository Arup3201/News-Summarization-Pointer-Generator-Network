Three people have been diagnosed with leprosy in Florida and some of the cases are thought to be linked to armadillos.

Health officials in Volusia County said that the cases are not related, though two of those who have been diagnosed with Hansen’s disease, or leprosy, since October had been in contact with nine-banded armadillos.

The incubation period for the disease can run up to 10 years, so the armadillo exposure did not have to be recent, Dr. Paul Rehme of the Volusia County Health Department told WESH.

About 95 per cent of people have a natural immunity to the bacteria carried by the leather-shelled mammals.

Wild armadillos 'are a large natural reservoir for M. leprae,' a 2011 study in the New England Journal said of the animal's relationship to the microbe.

The study said that armadillos in the eastern US do not have the disease like their brethren in southern states such as Texas and Louisiana, though that could change as the populations continue melding together.

Armadillo chili and other dishes based off of the animal are popular in southern states such as Texas. Eating armadillos presents a higher risk for contracting leprosy than touching them.

The animals do not naturally have leprosy, and the disease was brought to America by settlers from Europe.

The illness causes skin lesions and nerve damage, but is easily treatable. Flordia's current patients are responding well to their antibiotic treatment.

First signs of the disease in humans include ulcers, muscle weakness and eye problems. 

It later causes growths and claw-hands. 

In contrast to images of leper colonies from the Bible, current forms of the disease are not very contagious if caught early.

There are about 100 cases of leprosy reported in the US each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Armadillo chili and other dishes based off of the animal are eaten in southern states such as Texas. 

Most Americans who contract leprosy pick up the disease while abroad., and it is more widespread in India, Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa.

About 250,000 cases that occurred worldwide in 2008.

Armadillos are only found in the Western Hemisphere. 

Scientists have begun using the animals to test for leprosy treatments.
