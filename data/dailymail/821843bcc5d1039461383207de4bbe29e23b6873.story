The Labour leader is expected to lambast the retailer over zero-hours contracts 

High street retailer Sports Direct has snubbed remarks made by Ed Miliband over its use of zero-hour contracts.

In a speech today the Labour leader condemned the firm, owned by billionaire Mike Ashley, for using 'Victorian practices' for its 20,000-strong workforce, which give no guarantee of a minimum amount of work.

But the company has hit back saying it is reviewing 'core' employment procedures with a spokesman adding: 'With enemies like these, who needs friends?' according to the BBC. 

The rebuttal is reportedly intended to be a dig at recent poll ratings and reports that some Labour members want him to step down.

Miliband told supports in central England today: 'Sports Direct has thousands of its employers on zero hours contracts, the vast majority of its workforce.

'Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop. But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work.'

Labour said more than eight out of 10 of Sports Direct's workers across its 400 UK stores were on zero hours contracts. 

Miliband promised that if his party wins next May's national elections, it would ban such contracts for staff who work regular hours.

Sports Direct, which posted a 12 per cent rise in quarterly sales in September, told British media it was in the process of reviewing and updating its employment procedures.

Last night Tories accused Mr Miliband of hypocrisy, as several Labour-run councils employ zero-hours staff.

Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband's constituency, has admitted it employs 300 people on the contracts.

Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour.

Many of the company's 20,000 strong workforce are on zero-hours contracts despite working regular shifts 

It came as a poll of business leaders found just 14 per cent trust Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on the economy. Nearly six in ten prefer David Cameron and George Osborne.

The YouGov survey, commissioned by the Conservatives, also found six in ten thought the Tories would deliver a 'strong and healthy economy for Britain' compared with just 12 per cent for Ukip.   

But Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said: 'Another rehashed policy from Ed Miliband can't hide the fact that he still hasn't got an economic plan … We're already tackling the abuse of zero-hours contracts – after 13 years of Labour doing absolutely nothing about it.'
