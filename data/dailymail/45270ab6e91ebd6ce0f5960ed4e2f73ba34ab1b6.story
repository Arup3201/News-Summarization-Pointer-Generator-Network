The 'hero' is a grinning maniac behind the wheel of a supercar - and 'winning' means killing as many pedestrians as possible - but ultra-controversial videogame Carmageddon might be unleashed on another generation of teenagers.

A Kickstarter 'crowd sourced' funding page has launched, seeking funds for a sequel to the game, which was the first game ever to be refused a certificate by the BBFC in 1997.

The game sparked huge controversy in the UK, with vehicles reducing pedestrians to gory slush, and players awarded points for killing as many as possible. At the time, now-defunct game maker SCi said, 'It is violence that sells.'

The original Carmageddon was the first game ever to be refused a certificate by the BBFC - but went on to sell two million copies

Pedestrians meet a grisly end in the game, billed as 'the nastiest ever'

The game focused on causing car crashes - and gamers could score bonus points for running over pedestrians

An increasing number of games are now funded via the 'crowd sourced' Kickstarter websites, where fans of games or films can pledge money to have a sequel made.

The Carmageddon project has already secured $160,000 in funding.

'Max Damage is back,' says the new maker - referring to the game's psychotic anti-hero.

The original game deliberately courted controversy with 'bonuses' including one entitled 'Drugs', which turned the screen psychedelic colours.

'Carmageddon: Reincarnation is going to reintroduce the gaming world to the original freeform driving sensation, where pedestrians (and cows) equal points and your opponents are a bunch of crazies in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. It’s the racing game where racing is for wimps.'

Despite the controversy, the game sold two million copies.

The original team behind the controversial game are seeking funding for a new sequel

The developer, Stainless Games, was forced to 'recut' the game with zombies instead of pedestrians - although 'patches' were widely available online, which restored the original bloodshed.

;After years of negotiation, the original founders of Stainless recently bought back ALL the rights to Carmageddon,' says Stainless Games today. 'So now it’s back in its rightful home, we’ve embarked on the journey that will reboot the brand, and we want YOU to join us on that journey.'
