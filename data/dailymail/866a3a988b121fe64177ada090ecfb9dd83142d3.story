He may well feel like running away after his dire predictions for the economy turned out to be political huff and puff.

But does Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls really need to don a disguise as well?

The 46-year-old was virtually unrecognisable as he pounded the pavements, pulling his beanie right down over his ears and wearing the pair of spectacles he has taken to sporting recently.

We know it's you! Ed Ballswas virtually unrecognisable as he pounded the pavements, pulling his beanie right down over his ears and wearing a pair of spectacles

Balls, who wore fluorescent gloves and lycra tights, struck up a gurning pose as he paused from his jog through north London to do some stretches.

The Labour front-bencher, who was spotted on the rather challenging run near his London home, is known as a fitness fanatic and is keen on games of football as well as running.

Just as well - as he is also partial to food, with wife and fellow politician Yvette Cooper saying he cooks ‘all the meals’.

Balls, who has previously rustled up lasagne for 30 members of the Labour Party, describes his signature dish as his ‘14-hour pulled pork barbecue – pork shoulder, rubbed in brown sugar and spices, cooked indirectly in hickory-infused smoke, served in a white bun with a vinegar-based pouring sauce and home-made coleslaw, sweet beans and watermelon on the side’.

Tired Ed? The Shadow Chancellor seems out of breath
