Gareth Barry looked a man on a mission for a yellow card in the Merseyside derby. 

It took referee Martin Atkinson just two minutes to oblige, booking the Everton midfielder for a feisty challenge on Adam Lallana. Barry could have warranted another caution for handling Raheem Sterling's shot inside of the area and for fouling Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli, too.

Nevertheless, the yellow the 33-year-old received was enough to move Barry tantelisingly close to the top of the all-time Premier League bookings' list, but who will he have to overtake first?

10. Wayne Rooney (81 bookings)

Rooney is no stranger to ill discipline. The Manchester United and England captain kindly reminded us of that at Old Trafford on Saturday, although his hack on West Ham's Stewart Downing warranted a straight red from Lee Mason.

It was reminiscent of Rooney's sending off in the 2006 World Cup against Portugal for a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho - yet more evidence of repercussions for the 28-year-old's hot-headed decisions.

Eighty-one bookings in the Premier League means Rooney sits 10th in the table for now.

9. Philip Neville (82 bookings)

Former Manchester United and Everton defender Neville was hardly an angel during his 18-year stint in the Premier League, and he received 82 bookings before retiring.

In 2006, Neville finished the season with the most yellow cards out of any player in the league - 12. 

Three years earlier, the now-BBC pundit was United's most-booked player despite starting just six games. In contrast his brother, Gary, received three yellows to his seven that season.

8. Kevin Nolan (83 bookings)

West Ham's midfielder Nolan is never one to shy away from a challenge. The former Bolton and Newcastle  midfielder thought he'd equalised in the dying moments at Old Trafford on Saturday after coming on as a 75th-minute substitute.

His quacking celebration was cut short for offside, however, and Nolan must wait patiently for his first goal - and booking - of the season.

This year, Nolan is yet to see yellow in his two Premier League appearances since returning from a shoulder injury. Last season, though, he registered as many cautions as he did goals - seven.

7. George Boateng (85 bookings)

In Boateng's 13 years in the Premier League, the midfielder received 85 yellow cards.

Coventry City, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Hull City were his clubs between 1997 and 2010, and Boateng  kept his yellow card count up  throughout. It was in that final year he received a second booking for a dangerous challenge on Bacary Sagna after poking Nicklas Bendtner in the eye.

Ten in 1998, and nine apiece in the following two years. Boateng was nothing if not consistent.

6. Robbie Savage (89 bookings)

For a while, Savage held the illustrious position at the top of this most-booked players table. He has since, though, lost his 'dirtiest player in Premier League history' crown and been overtaken.

Savage was, by no means, a stranger to a telling off from a referee. Take the 2003-04 season, for example. The midfielder received 13 yellow cards that year at Birmingham alone.

Two years later, he was cautioned 11 times for Blackburn. That makes the ex-Derby and Leicester player sixth in our list with a total of 89.

5. Scott Parker (92 bookings)

Parker no longer adds to his Premier League tally of 92 as the Fulham midfielder competes in the Championship. Nevertheless, the 33-year-old remains comfortably fifth.

It seems Newcastle brought the aggressive nature out of Parker. The England international was booked nine times in each of his two seasons at St James' Park between 2005 and 2007.

That said, Parker bested that in 2002-03 with Charlton, adding 10 to his still-young tally at the time.

4. Gareth Barry (96 bookings)

The man in the running for the title. Barry added one more to his 96 on Saturday, and the midfielder could be top of the list by the end of this season with Everton if he continues his trend.

In Barry's defence, the 33-year-old sits fifth in the Premier League's all-time appearances list, too, having played more than 500 games for Aston Villa, Manchester City and Everton combined.

Working in the engine room, a yellow card arriving here or there can only be expected.

3. Paul Scholes (97 bookings)

The former Manchester United midfielder was not unfamiliar with seeing a referee reach for his pocket. Arguably his most famous yellow card did not arrive in the Premier League, though. 

It came in the semi final of the Champions League. Scholes was cautioned against Juventus, ruling him out of their win in the 1999 final against Bayern Munich  at the Nou Camp.

That rule has since been changed after UEFA announced they will no longer hold suspensions that carry to such European finals. Too little, too late for Scholes, though.

=1. Lee Bowyer (99 bookings)

=1. Kevin Davies (99 bookings) 

And we have a tie! Neither could nab a century during their time in the Premier League and, barring any miraculous return from the 37-year-old Davies, they'll have to share the infamous title.

Two different players that went very different ways about getting to the peak of this list. 

Davies, now a striker for League One club Preston, stayed true to his yellow card nature internationally. The former Blackburn, Southampton and Bolton goalscorer made his England debut in 2010 as a substitute for Peter Crouch, and was immediately booked.

Hardly surprising, given Davies has committed the most fouls in Premier League history, too.

Bowyer, on the other hand, was far more of a traditional scrapper. Squaring up with fellow players - and on the odd occasion his own Newcastle teammate Kieron Dyer - became a regular occurrence.

The ex-Leeds, West Ham, Newcastle and Birmingham midfielder first season in the Premier League in 1996 saw the aggressive player pick up seven bookings, his last in 2011 finished the same.

Davies and Bowyer may not remain top for long, however, as Barry nears the unwanted record.
