The Duchess of Cambridge is a huge fan of Hobbs, so it comes as no surprise that the High Street store has unveiled a royal-inspired collection.

Hobbs' new capsule collection, Collection No.1, has been produced in association with Historic Royal Palaces and prides itself on being a fashion-forward range with a subtle nod to the royal archive.

The clothing store was granted access to the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection, which includes items dating back to the 17th Century.

Modern twist: The designs are inspired by the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection, which contains items dating back to the 17th century, alongside spectacular uniforms with contemporary tailoring

There is a Parade Trench, inspired by the guardsmen’s overcoats at the Tower of London, and a pair of pleat-front flannel trousers, informed by the classic British tailoring found in the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection.

Elsewhere, archival references have been deftly reimagined for the 21st century with contemporary tailoring.

The chain-link decoration on the grey
 flannel Sovereign Dress harks back to detailing on a 1910 royal 
constabulary helmet, while exquisite royal riding boots are the 
inspiration behind a sleek new vachetta-leather pair.

Also key to Collection No. 1 is Hobbs’ support of British manufacturers.

Soft flannels were sourced from Joseph H Clissold and rich doeskin from Hainsworth, two Yorkshire-based companies.

A plush jacquard created for the 
Alexandra Spot Trousers was woven by Suffolk mill Stephen Walters & 
Sons, the same company commissioned to create silks for HM Queen 
Elizabeth II’s coronation robes in 1953.

This limited edition collection, which ranges in price between £59 - £600, will be available at five Hobbs stores.

The
 launch coincides with a major reinvention for Hobbs footwear under the 
direction of shoe designer Olivia Morris and a dramatic store redesign 
that will begin with the brands Covent Garden flagship.
