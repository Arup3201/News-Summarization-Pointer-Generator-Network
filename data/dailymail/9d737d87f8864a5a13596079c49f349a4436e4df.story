The hospital where one man died of Ebola and two nurses treating him contracted the deadly virus has seen a steep and sharp decline in patients.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, has become a 'ghost town,' with patients cancelling previously scheduled appointments for procedures and surgeries and others going out of their way to travel to other facilities even in emergency situations.

This after the hospital took in a patient infected with Ebola on September 30, Thomas Eric Duncan, who later died at the facility on October 8.

No patients: According to a local worker, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital (above) in Dallas, Texas, has become a 'ghost town' since three people having Ebola have been in the hospital

No wait: Currently, there is not even a wait to see doctors in the Emergency Room at the facility

First case: Thomas Eric Duncan (above), was admitted to the hospital on September 30 with Ebola and died on October 8

A few days later, on October 12, Nina Pham, a nurse who cared for Duncan, was confirmed to have contracted the deadly disease.

Then, on October 15, another nurse who cared for Duncan, Amber Vinson, also tested positive for Ebola. 

Pham, who is currently being treated at the National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, was recently downgraded from good to fair condition, while Vinson, who is being treated at Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, has been in stable condition since being admitted.

There are also fears that a third woman who handled some of Duncan's specimens may have been exposed to the virus, and she has been quarantined aboard a Carnival cruise ship during the possible incubation period for the virus.

Downgraded: Nina Pham (seen being treated at the National Institutes of Health hospital), the first nurse to contract the deadly virus at Texas Health Presbyterian, has just been downgraded from good to fair condition

Holding steady: Amber Vinson (above), the second nurse to contract the disease at the hospital, is in stable condition at Emory Hospital in Atlanta

'It feels like a ghost town,' Rachelle Cohorn, a local health care vendor who has been to the hospital recently, told WFAA.

'No one is even walking around the hospital.'

What's more, when a call was placed to the hospital to ask how long the wait was for emergency room services, it was revealed there was no wait time.

Prior to this, average wait time at the hospital was roughly an hour.

Nothing: Even outside the hospital there is no activity

Now, the hospital is working to go about proving how safe their facility is, and trying to gain back public trust. 

'I would tell this community that Presby is an absolutely safe hospital to come to,' Dr. Dan Varga, the chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, which owns the Dallas hospital, told ABC News.

'We've been in communication with our doctors that have their private offices in our professional buildings around the campus who are getting 40, 50, 60 percent cancellations just for fear of being somewhere in the geography of the hospital where Ebola is treated.'

Only time will tell if this hospital can bounce back, especially as public fear of the deadly virus continues to grow.
