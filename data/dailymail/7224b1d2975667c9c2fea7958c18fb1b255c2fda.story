The oldest known shell to have been engraved by an early human has been uncovered in a Dutch museum collection, where it remained unnoticed since the 1930s.

The ancient mollusc, originally discovered on the island of Java, is between 430,000 and 540,000-years-old, dating to the time Homo erectus inhabited the remote volcanic outpost.

The engravings resemble the previously oldest-known etchings, which were created by either Neanderthals or modern humans around 100,000 years ago.

The shell has a polished edge and a zigzag pattern of engravings, suggesting it was used from cutting or scraping.

If this is the case, it means our ancestors, Homo erectus, were more intelligent than we thought. 

The successful, long-lived species emerged out of Africa almost two million years ago, and were possibly the first early humans to live in hunter-gather societies they also used rafts to travel the oceans.

'It rewrites human history,' Dr Stephen Munro, a Australian National University paleoanthropologist who made the find, told Business Insider. 

'It's evidence that Homo erectus exploited these aquatic food resources, and fits with other evidence that they probably foraged in and around water.' 

Geometric engravings are considered to be a sign of modern cognitive abilities, but the origins of such behaviour have been debated.

The latest analysis of freshwater mollusc shell collected from the Trinil fossil site on Java in the 1890s imply Homo erectus was also capable of 'modern' behaviour.

Geometric engravings are considered to be a sign of modern cognitive abilities, but the origins of such behaviour have been debated. 'It rewrites human history,' said Dr Stephen Munro, a paleoanthropologist at the Australian National University

The team found that Homo erectus were able to open the shells by drilling a hole through the shell with a shark's tooth.

This damaged the muscles causing  the valves of the shell to open, so that the contents can be eaten.

Dr Josephine Joordens, of Leiden University in The Netherlands, said: 'The manufacture of geometric engravings is generally interpreted as indicative of modern cognition and behaviour.

'Key questions in the debate on the origin of such behaviour are whether this innovation is restricted to Homo sapiens and whether it has a uniquely African origin.

'Here we report on a fossil freshwater shell assemblage from the main bone layer of Trinil - the type locality of Homo erectus discovered by Eugene Dubois in 1891.

The engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art

It may look like a cross, but lines scratched into a cave wall could be proof that Neanderthals were more intelligent and creative than previously thought.

The cross-hatched engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art.

The find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and their extinct cousins shared the capacity for abstract expression, according to a team of scientists who studied the site.

Experts examined and described the grooves in a rock that had been covered with sediment in the study published in the PNAS journal.

Archaeologists had previously found artefacts associated with Neanderthal culture laid over the top of the artwork, suggesting that the engravings must be older, said Professor Clive Finlayson, director of heritage at the Gibraltar Museum.

'The production of purposely made painted or engraved designs on cave walls is recognised as a major cognitive step in human evolution - considered exclusive to modern humans, he said.

The latest analysis of the freshwater mollusc shell (shown) collected from the Trinil fossil site on Java in the 1890s imply Homo erectus was also capable of 'modern' behaviour

'In the Dubois collection in the Natural History Museum in Leiden we found evidence for freshwater shellfish consumption by hominins, one unambiguous shell tool and a shell with a geometric engraving.

'Together our data indicate the engraving was made by Homo erectus and it is considerably older than the oldest geometric engravings described so far.

'Although it is at present not possible to assess the function or meaning of the engraved shell this discovery suggests that engraving abstract patterns was in the realm of Asian Homo erectus cognition and neuromotor control.' 

The ability to make and use tools dates back millions of years. Chimpanzees - our closest living relatives - can devise spear-like weapons for hunting and create specialised tool kits for foraging ants.

This suggests our family tree could have possessed wooden tools since the ancestors of humans and chimps diverged some four million years ago.

The shell was originally found in Java, an island in Indonesia. Today it has a population of 143 million
