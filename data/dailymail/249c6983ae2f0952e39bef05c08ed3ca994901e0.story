Scientists in Britain face being barred from developing life-saving treatments after a court ruled it is ‘immoral’ to use embryos to produce stem cells.

The European Court of Justice has decreed that patenting any treatment using the cells is ‘commercial exploitation’ and ‘contrary to morality’.

Scientists warned the ‘devastating decision’ will stop pioneering treatments for degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s being developed in the UK, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the multi-million pound biotechnology industry.

The decision follows a case brought by Greenpeace in Germany against Professor Oliver Brüstle (pictured) at the University of Bonn. He filed a patent with the German government in 1997 to convert embryonic stem cells into nerve cells to help patients with Parkinson's disease

They believe cutting edge research – 
and the huge investment behind it - could move to other countries such 
as the United States and China.

But pro-life groups, who argue it is immoral to experiment with embryos to advance medicine, welcomed the ruling.

The decision, made unanimously by 13 
judges in Luxembourg, follows a case brought by Greenpeace in Germany 
against Professor Oliver Brüstle at the University of Bonn.

Professor Brüstle filed a patent with
 the German government in 1997 to convert embryonic stem cells into 
nerve cells to help patients with Parkinson’s disease.

Greenpeace challenged it and the case went to the highest court in Germany and then Luxembourg.

The resulting 10-page judgement 
prohibits patenting any process which involves removing a stem cell from
 and then destroying a ‘human embryo’ – defined as anything ‘capable of 
commencing the process of development of a human being.’

It states: ‘Patents may not be 
granted for inventions whose commercial exploitation would be contrary 
to morality... In particular patents shall not be awarded for uses of 
human embryos for industrial or commercial purpose.’

The court has ruled that patenting these processes would contradict the European law which protects human life, including embryos, on the grounds that it forms 'commercialisation' of human parts

‘commercialisation’ of human parts.

However, scientists say stem cells 
taken from embryos in their early stages are crucial in developing 
life-saving treatments because they can turn into any cell type found in
 the body and so can be used to repair diseased and defective tissue.

‘I have just won an international prize from the New York Stem Cell Foundation for translating stem cell research into clinical practice, yet I find now that Europe, the continent in which I am doing this research, is basically calling me immoral’

PROF PETER COFFEY, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON

Alzheimer’s, cancer, blindness, 
multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease are all conditions which 
could benefit from an injection of these healthy cells.

A trial of a stem cell treatment for 
blindness in young people – the first of its kind in Europe – has just 
begun at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, with investment from an 
American biotechology firm.

And Professor Peter Coffey of 
University College London wants to use the cells to find a cure for 
macular degeneration, the most common form of age-related blindness.

He said: ‘This is a devastating decision which will stop stem cell therapies use in medicine. 

‘The potential to treat disabling and life threatening disease commonly using stem cells will not be realised in Europe.

‘I have just won an international 
prize from the New York Stem Cell Foundation for translating stem cell 
research into clinical practice, yet I find now that Europe, the 
continent in which I am doing this research, is basically calling me 
immoral.’

Professor Austin Smith, of Cambridge 
University’s Wellcome Trust for Stem Cell Research, said: ‘This 
unfortunate decision by the Court leaves scientists in a ridiculous 
position. We are funded to do research for the public good, yet 
prevented from taking our discoveries to the marketplace where they 
could be developed into new medicines.’

Professor Brüstle said after the 
ruling: ‘With this unfortunate decision, the fruits of years of research
 by European scientists will be wiped away and left to the non-European 
countries.

‘European researchers may conduct 
basic research, which is then implemented elsewhere in medical 
procedures which will eventually be re-imported to Europe. How do I 
explain this to my students?’

But pro-life campaigner Josephine 
Quintavalle said scientists should use other available technologies, 
such as adult stem cells.

She added: ‘We are a long way from a 
declaration on the inviolability of the human embryo but this is 
certainly a magnificent judgment in the right direction, and at the very
 least gives some added protection and respect to human life at its 
earliest stage.

‘It is to be hoped that this will 
turn the attention of scientists once and for all away from the human 
embryo to concentrate on the innumerable ethically sourced neonatal and 
adult stem cell therapies which are already available.  

Embryonic stem cells are created 
during IVF treatment for infertile couples. Several eggs are fertilised 
as part of the process, but many will not be used. Currently they  are 
either destroyed or, if the couple give their permission, donated  for 
research.
