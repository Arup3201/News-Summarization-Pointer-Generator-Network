A former soldier has filed a $4 million lawsuit against his ex-wife, who he claims obsessively stalked him and tried to 'ruin his life' following their messy divorce.

Jacob C. Ivancev, 44, who served in Iraq in 2007 and was discharged from the Army in 2012, met Roe Garrido at a gym in New York's Upper East Side in 1999.

Garrido, 48, is a former body builder and martial artist.

The pair were married in the Bahamas, but Ivancev filed for divorce in Manhattan in 2011, which is when he says things became crazy.

The ex-Special Forces officer says Garrido followed him from New York to Colorado in 2012, The New York Post reported.

Jacob C. Ivancev, 44, who served in Iraq in 2007, says his ex-wife is out for revenge after their messy divorce settlement, and even followed him from New York to Colorado, and has filed a lawsuit in Manhattan's Supreme Court (pictured)

His lawsuit states that she pretended to be a FedEx messenger in order to get into his home.

Garrido was unhappy with their divorce settlement and sought revenge, Ivancev said.

She even got a job at the Reebok Sports Club where he worked out.

Ivancev also claims Garrido filed multiple fake complaints against him with police, one of which had his pistol license suspended and affected his job as a security guard.

However Garrido tells a much different story.

She told The Post their marriage ended because Ivancev was having multiple affairs.

She said he twice threatened to shoot her.

Garrido admits to following Ivancev to the the Fort Carson army base in Colorado Springs, however she said she went there to tell him she was pregnant.

'I knew that if he saw me he wouldn't let me in so I picked up a FedEx package that was on the floor for one of his neighbors and I knocked,' says Garrido

'I knew that if he saw me he wouldn't let me in so I picked up a FedEx package that was on the floor for one of his neighbors and I knocked,' Garrido told The Post.

'I said, 'FedEx,' and when he opened the door he tried to shut the door on me. I pushed my way in.'

Garrido claims the two then had a physical assault and she miscarried as a result.

Ivancev and his attorney have not commented on their claim, but are asking for $4 million in damages.

The lawsuit says the money is a payout for the damage Garrido has caused to his life.

'She says he’s gay, she’s been telling everyone that, she told the CIA and FBI he was a spy, she told the Army he was a male prostitute,' Ivancev's roommate told The New York Daily News.

This woman is doing more damage to him than when he was in Iraq. And now he can’t get a job.

'When he was serving in Iraq and his buddies were getting cut to pieces, she was living on the Upper East Side off his hazardous duty pay.'
