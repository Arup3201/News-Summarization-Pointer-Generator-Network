William, Kate and the rest of the world are excitedly counting down the days until their baby is born next month.

But if you simply can't wait that long to see what a royal infant wears, you're in luck.

A new exhibition of royal baby memorabilia - featuring shoes worn by Queen Victoria's children, a quilted baby cap belonging to Charles I and a linen vest embroidered with a tiny crown, worn by a baby George III - is opening at the Museum Of London.

Many of the items in the exhibition were baby clothes and shoes belonging to the babies of Queen Victoria, left, including these slippers, right, belonging to Princess Beatrice, who was born in 1857

A Royal Arrival showcases a collection of fascinating memorabilia worn by the impending Baby of Cambridge's royal ancestors, many which have never before been seen in a public display.

Described as a 'small but exciting exhibition about some significant royal arrivals since the 17th century', the collection, curated by Timothy Long, Curator of Fashion and Decorative Arts at the Museum of London, features shoes worn by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's nine children: Victoria, Edward, Alice, Alfred, Helena, Louise, Arthur, Leopold and Beatrice.

Highlights include a cream cotton robe with embroidered royal feathers and cap worn by Prince Albert Edward (late Edward VII), and a nursing apron thought to be worn by Queen Victoria.

The exhibition coincides with the imminent arrival of the Baby of Cambridge, who will be third-in-line to the throne

A museum spokesman said: 'This is an opportunity for us to celebrate the much anticipated birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeâ€™s new arrival and to showcase some wonderful items in our collection.

Some of the shoes have never been seen before in public

'Most of these precious items are rarely seen by members of the public and they mark some incredible moments in the history of our nation.

'The arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family is a momentous occasion.

'Third in line to the throne, this baby is descended from a long line of Kings and Queens and will one day become monarch of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth countries.'

The history of the Museum of London is linked with that of the Royal family, as their forerunner, the London Museum, was once based at Kensington Palace.

The exhibition opens on Friday.
