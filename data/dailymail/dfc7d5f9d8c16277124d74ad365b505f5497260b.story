An obese baker has lost five and a half stone despite being surrounded by sugary, icing-smothered cakes every single day.

Jenny Prideaux, 46, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, saw her waist line expand as she constantly tucked into her own creations at the the bakery where she creates handmade wedding and celebration cakes.

But at 17 stone and size 22, the mother--of-one realised it was time to beat the bulge and, since embarking on a gruelling slimming plan, she has slimmed down to 11 stone 5lbs in just five months.

Jenny Prideaux found herself picking at her cakes and making her weight soar, she has now slimmed down

Jenny, who is mother to Joseph, 10, said: 'I love all food, and being a cake maker made it way too easy to just pick at sugary foods all day.

'After Christmas 2012 I saw some photos of myself and I couldn't bear to look at them. I suddenly realised that I need to shift the weight and I wanted to do it quickly.

'Now, I still love my job, but I've learnt not to eat what I bake.'

Jenny was not new to dieting plans and had previously tried various well known ones, but had not been able to shift the weight.

Growing up she says she had a normal diet and never had any weight issues.

Instead her problems began as Jenny got older and she would find herself picking at more and more goodies but didn't realise she was piling on the pounds. After her wedding to IT technical sales director husband Andy, 46, in 2002, her weight rocketed.

One of her weaknesses was to indulge in her favourite treat of lemon cake.

But after seeing the snap of herself, Jenny signed up to Cambridge Weight Plan, replacing foods with shakes, soups and porridge.

The weight began to roll off, and on average the baker would lose around a stone a month.

Jenny said: 'It wasn't easy, I often had days where I could have easily chucked out the scales and shakes and ate some food that made me feel more content.

'But unlike other dieting groups I have 
one-to-one appointments with my own consultant so it's not so easy to 
not just turn up, the pressure of the scales keeps me going.

'My family and friends were never bothered about my weight but they have all been incredibly helpful and supportive.'

After just five months on the plan Jenny now weighs a healthy 11st 5lbs and is a size 14.

Jenny said: 'I'm now much more aware of what I eat, if I have something naughty I will watch what I eat for the rest of the day.

'I no longer pick at my baking goodies whilst I'm at work and throw the leftovers out for the birds instead.

'I've had to buy a whole new wardrobe for my holiday, none of my old clothes hit me and I can't afford to keep buying new ones so I'm using that as an incentive not to pile the pounds back on.

'I feel like a completely new person, I'm happy with my weight now but I still have a shake a day and regularly use the scales, I would eventually like to be an easy size 12 but I'm proud of my progress so far.'
