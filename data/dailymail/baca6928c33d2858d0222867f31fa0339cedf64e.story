A mechanic who beat his lover's newborn baby to death may have been jealous because she wouldn't have a baby with him, a judge said.

Michael Pearce, 33, has been jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of six-week-old Alfie Sullock after hitting him with a shoe and a plastic bottle.

He had offered to look after the newborn so his girlfriend could have her first night out after giving birth.

But in a 'momentary loss of control' he lashed out at the child, who died four days later suffering from bleeding on the brain.

Today, it emerged his outburst came just hours after his 29-year-old girlfriend, Donna Sullock, told him she would not have a baby with him.

Mr Justice Baker asked whether jealousy had played a part in the killing.

He told Pearce: 'Alfie died as a result of you having inflicted upon him multiple blunt force injuries.

'It may well be that, due to your denials... whether you were motivated by jealousy as a result of Donna’s refusal to have your child earlier that evening.'

And disputing Pearce’s mitigation, the judge added: 'This was not a momentary loss of control by a sleep-deprived parent. Alfie was only in your care for a short time.'

On August 16 last year, Pearce suggested Ms Sullock had a night out so she could get to know more people in his area.

Former holiday rep Ms Sullock, who lived in Cardiff, had met Pearce while six months pregnant and had started to spend most weekends at her boyfriend’s house.

Prior to her girls’ night out, she went to a local pub with Pearce - where he drank four pints of beer within an hour.

Pearce asked Ms Sullock to have a child with him - but she said no.

During the course of Pearce’s trial, the Crown said the defendant showed 'obsessive' behaviour towards Ms Sullock - and had showered her with gifts just a few weeks into their relationship.

Ms Sullock said that, when she left the house for her night out, Alfie was 'happy and healthy' and did not have as much as scratch on him.

While babysitting Alfie, Pearce sent Ms Sullock a text saying: 'You can trust me you know'.

But at 9.11pm he dialled 999, after claiming he had gone to the toilet and returned to see Alfie had stopped breathing.

When paramedics arrived moments later, they found the baby lifeless and blue.  

Pearce was home alone babysitting Alfie last year when paramedics were called to his address in Nelson, Caerphilly, south Wales.

A
 trial at Newport Crown Court heard it was  the first time divorcee 
Pearce had been left alone with the baby. Alfie died after suffering 
head and abdominal injuries.

Motorcycle mechanic Pearce was today cleared by a jury of Alfie's murder, but convicted of manslaughter.

During the 
trial, the defendant's counsel had queried whether Ms Sullock may have 
accidentally hurt her son while getting ready and whether Alfie's 
bruising was caused by medics trying to revive him. Those two claims 
were both disputed in court by Alfie's mother and paramedics.

Pearce,
 who had drunk five pints of beer that evening, said he had 'no idea' 
how Alfie was injured. He said he raised the alarm after returning from 
the toilet and noticing Alfie had stopped breathing. 

As the jury delivered its majority verdict, Ms Sullock broke down in tears.

The
 former holiday rep, who had clutched her son's teddy while attending 
every single day of her former boyfriend's trial, later said: 'We are 
disappointed at today’s verdict but satisfied he will still go to prison
 for what he has done.

'Whatever sentence he gets will never be long enough for taking Alfie's life away. We have been through a year of hell.

'Thanks
 to everyone for their support-friends, family, the community, people 
who don’t know me have given me and my family amazing support. Rest In 
Peace Alfie.'

A healthy and happy Alfie was born at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW), Cardiff, on July 6, 2013, following an uneventful pregnancy.

Ms Sullock, who lived in Fairwater, Cardiff, discovered she was expecting while working abroad in Crete.

She returned home to the UK, and six months into her pregnancy she became friends with Pearce following a chance meeting in Fairwater.

Healthy and happy: Alfie was first taken to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to UHW. On August 20, life support was withdrawn and Alfie died

The pair later became an item, although prosecutors said Pearce began to display 'obsessive behaviour' towards her and even asked her to give him a child just weeks into their relationship.

On August 16, Ms Sullock travelled from her home in the Welsh capital to Pearce's home in Nelson to stay over the weekend.

However, magistrate's son Pearce suggested she go out with his friend's girlfriend for a 'girly night out'.

Before then though, Pearce went out to a nearby pub and drank four pints of beer in 45 minutes. He returned home and looked after Alfie while Ms Sullock got ready.

The baby's mother said her son was healthy and breathing normally before she left. Less than half an hour into her night, a worried Ms Sullock asked if her son was doing okay.

The defendant sent a text saying: 'you can trust me'. 

He also texted her photographs of Alfie during the evening claiming it was to 'reassure' her the baby was okay. 

In the half an hour that followed, at 9.11pm an ambulance was called.

The seven-minute call was later played to the jury in full.

When asked by the operator did he see what happened, the defendant replied he had simply given the baby a bottle and then the child had stopped breathing.

Earlier during the case, prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees said: 'Children do not go cold instantly.'

Alfie was first taken to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to UHW. On August 20, life support was withdrawn and Alfie died, the court heard.

A Home Office pathologist later gave a provisional cause of death as 'blunt trauma head injury'.

Following the completion of the case, Ms Sullock wished to thank family, friends as well as total strangers for their 'amazing support' during her 'year of hell'.
