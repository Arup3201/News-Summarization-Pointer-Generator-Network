The radio station which allowed two of its DJs to prank call the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital has suspended all advertising on its shows.

Radio network Austereo announced it had suspended all advertising on 2Day FM following a number of high-profile advertiser boycotts.

Major firms such as Telstra, Coles and Lexus Australia had already pulled their advertising campaigns following the death of 46-year-old nurse Jacintha Saldanha.

It is believed that other large companies including Woolworths and Optus
were also considering withdrawing their advertisements. 

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Sandy Kaye, a spokeswoman for Austereo, said: 'We have pulled advertising on 2Day FM 
indefinitely.'

The decision means that no advertising will run on the station from Saturday afternoon until at least Monday.

When asked how much the loss of advertising might cost, Ms Kaye added that money was 'not important right now ... [the] focus is on all people
concerned first and foremost'.

The advertising has been pulled until Monday at least with Ms Kaye saying the management at the station were more concerned with the welfare of DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian

Mrs Saldanha was found dead on Friday morning. It was just three days after the 46-year-old nurse had transferred a hoax call from Greig and Christian who obtained intimate details about the Duchess of Cambridge while she was staying at King Edward VII hospital.

Since then the radio station has faced global outrage and come under sustained abuse online.

TMZ reported that Lexus Australia became the latest advertiser to axe all of its advertising from the radio station.

A spokesman for the car giant said it had pulled its media campaign because of the 'current situation'.

It is believed the firm pulled advertising from the station last year following a different incident.

The new campaign, which began on November 1, was the first time the firm had advertised with the station since the previous incident.

The telephone giant Telstra had earlier joined a list of companies removing their advertising from the radio station.

The station's owner was forced to pull advertising over panic from advertisers.

Facing the media; Southern Cross Austereo CEO Rhys Holleran came out in defence of the DJs behind the prank call to Kate Middleton's hospital

Yesterday, King Edward VII hospital said they it written a letter of complaint to the Australian radio station's parent company about the 'truly appalling' prank.

The hospital's chairman Lord Glenarthur said he wanted to 'protest' against the 'extremely foolish' gag which he branded 'truly appalling'.

Lord Glenarthur said Mrs Saldanha's death was 'tragic beyond words'.

His letter to Southern Cross Austereo said the immediate consequence of the station's 'premeditated and ill-considered actions' led to the 'humiliation' of Ms Saldanha and another nurse.

'I appreciate that you cannot undo the damage which has been done but I would urge you to take steps to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated,' it added.

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, 46, died in an apparent suicide after she transferred a hoax call from Australian DJs who retrieved sensitive information about Kate Middleton while in hospital

The boss of the radio company at the centre of the royal hoax call yesterday refused to sack the DJs behind the stunt and painted them as victims.

2DayFM presenters Greig and Christian were taken off air after it emerged Ms Saldanha - who took their prank call at Kate Middleton's hospital - had died in a suspected suicide.

The mother of two had been manning the hospital switchboard when the Australian hoaxers called and she transferred the call to the Duchess of Cambridge's ward.

Rhys Holleran, the chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns the station, said the presenters were 'completely shattered' and had been offered counselling.

Mr Holleran told a press conference in Melbourne that the primary concern was for the family of Jacintha Saldanha, whose body was found yards from the King Edward VII Hospital.

He said: 'I spoke to both presenters early this morning and it's fair to say they are completely shattered.

'These people aren't machines, they're human beings. What happened is incredibly tragic and we’re deeply saddened and we’re incredibly affected by that.’

He added: 'I think prank calls as a craft in radio have been going for decades and decades and are not just part of one radio station or network or country.

'No-one could have reasonably foreseen what ended up being an incredibly tragic day.'

Mr Holleran declined to reveal who had dreamed up the prank call but said: ‘These things are often done collaboratively.'

Co-hosts: The DJ duo has been suspended from the Sydney-based station

A source confirmed that 2DayFM’s lawyers had listened to audio of the entire call and had given it clearance to go to air.

Mr Holleran said it was ‘a bit early’ to be drawing conclusions from what was really a ‘deeply tragic matter.’

He added: ‘I don’t think anyone could have reasonably foreseen that this was going to be a result.'
