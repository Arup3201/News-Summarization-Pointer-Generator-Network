Fashion's ultimate muse is making her debut at legendary auction house Christie's in London.

While she has previously donated a photograph of herself for an NSPCC charity auction and featured at other London-based houses such as Bloomsbury, this is the first time Christie's have commissioned a collection.

Featuring a glittering sculpture with exaggerated breasts and a photograph of her younger self aggressively punching the camera, the collection based on Moss, 39, is explosive and challenging.

Allen Jones' Kate Moss in bronze glitter, 2013, estimated to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000

Curated by renowned collector Gert Elfering, the works in various media celebrating Moss are otherwise unavailable on the market and represent the most celebrated global icon of fashion and style either uniquely or in very limited editions.

The collection features mainly photographic images, since that is the field in which she has made her career. The collection comprises many in exceptionally large sizes, some being famous and historic images as well as less familiar but equally compelling ones.

The selection of artists includes Allen Jones, with his work Kate Moss in bronze glitter from 2013, which is estimated to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000.

Stunning works by Annie Liebovitz, Mary McCartney, Craig McDean, Irving Penn, Mario Sorrenti, Sam Taylor-Wood, Juergen Teller, Mario Testino, Ellen von Unwerth, and Albert Watson also feature.

Their images are complemented by new, 
specially commissioned painting and sculpture by Allen Jones, a collage 
by Sir Peter Blake, a tapestry by Chuck Close, and a sculpture of Kate 
Moss as a naked angel in 18ct gold by Nick Knight.

'I am pleased to be working with Christie's once again, on this occasion to celebrate the living icon Kate Moss,' says collector and curator Gert Elfering.

'She is the subject and inspiration 
for this collection, but the importance of the present works is in her 
collaboration with the internationally renowned artists who created 
them.

'As I saw the collection taking 
shape, I was delighted by the variety and the consistent power of the 
works, and I have already enjoyed seeing the positive reaction in the 
faces of others when they first see them.

'Kate is the ultimate modern muse and
we will be seeing her images in major museums and private collections 
for years to come. She has altered perceptions for women across the 
globe, encouraging them towards greater individuality and expressive 
freedom.

'There is so much you can learn from 
Kate - how you should always remain true to yourself, develop your own 
style, and emphasise your individuality'.

The Kate Moss - The Collection action will take place at Christie's on 25 September.

'[This auction] is a very special event at Christie's this fall, a unique presentation of emblematic works that powerfully capture the very essence of contemporary glamour and style,' says Philippe Garner, Director of Photographs at Christie's.

'Gert Elfering has applied his great flair as a curator, to the concept of bringing together a group of outstanding works around the theme of the greatest icon of style of the modern age, Kate Moss. 

'Gert recognised the appetite of today's collectors for photographs that confound traditional norms.  And so he has worked with the artists involved to create unique or very limited edition printings in a range of scales that, in certain cases, reach dramatic mural proportions. 

'He was also keen to include works in other media, reminding us that photography, while central to our image culture, should, in the hands of its great practitioners, be measured and appreciated among the arts in all media'.
