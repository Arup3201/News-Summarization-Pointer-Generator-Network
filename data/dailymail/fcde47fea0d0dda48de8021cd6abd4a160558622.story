Jimmy Stringer was jailed today for five years for his part in a smash and grab raid

A smash and grab jewel thief is starting a five year stretch behind bars today thanks to a group of have-a-go heroes who sat on him until police arrived.

Brave onlookers were photographed rugby tackling Jimmy Stringer, 23, and making a citizen's arrest after he smashed his way through the window of a jeweller's shop with a sledge hammer and stolen £100,000 worth of watches.

Stringer had managed to leave the store on foot despite an anti-theft device billowing smoke from the shop in a bid to disorientate the thief and an unidentified accomplice.

But Oxford Crown Court was told today that passer by Ali Shehan bundled Stringer to the ground before he could flee the scene.

Onlookers then piled on top of the thief and he was held down until police arrived.

Two other gang members on scooters were also part of the targeted rain in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

CCTV
cameras caught several other members of the public throwing advertising
boards at the riders and a pensioner attempted to hit the pillion rider
on the scooter with her walking stick but narrowly missed.

Despite four arrests being made by 
police only one robbery charge against Stringer was ever brought - and 
he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity at a previous hearing.

Prosecutor Jonathan Stone told a hearing at Oxford Crown Court: 'He was rugby tackled to the floor by Mr Shehan.

'During this process his crash helmet fell off. The defendant said: "You’re a dead man. You’re a dead man."

Other shoppers ran to the aid of the brave man and piled in to stop Stringer wriggling free, the judge was told.

The
dramatic intervention happened yards away from the targeted Robert 
Jones jewellers in High Street, Banbury at about 11am on September 11.

'It was a well planned operation,' added Mr Stone.

Arrested: The shoppers held Stringer until police arrived to take him away

'Stop him': One witness said he heard people shouting 'stop him, stop him' after he was part of the gang who carried out a raid on the jewellery store beforehand

'It just fell flat at the end as they 
hadn’t planned their escape. The watches - worth £100,000 pounds - were 
seized by a member of the public and taken back to the jewellery store.

'There
was £30,000 pounds of damage caused. Windows were smashed and watches 
were damaged and needed to be repaired,' the prosecuter added.

Mr Stone said the defendant told police he met the trio on holiday in Tenerife and they told him about the store.

He knew they were local to the area, but didn’t know their identities.

William
Woodman, defending, said: 'The weapon was used as a tool, rather than 
in a threatening way. He did not use it as a weapon on anyone. No words 
were used.'

Admitted robbery: Stringer was part of a gang that robbed Michael Jones' Jewellers, who wielded hammers and smashed jewellery cases

In custody: Stringer was jailed for five years - he will spend half the term in jail and the rest on licence

He added: 'The loss of employment led to him spiralling into the receipt of benefits. He had also built up a drug debt.'

Addressing the light-haired defendant, Judge Patrick Eccles said: 'This was a targeted smash and grab raid.'It was down to the people who stepped in who stopped you getting away with what you had taken.'

He will spend half his sentence in custody and the remainder on licence.

Wearing
a blue jumper and jeans, Stringer, from Popham Street, Islington, North
London, appeared agitated throughout the hearing.

He was led away to the cells by an officer as his heavily pregnant blonde girlfriend wept in the public gallery.

Anti-theft system: Smoke billowed from the shop as an anti-theft device was set off to disorientate raiders. It has been targeted by thieves three times in the past five years
