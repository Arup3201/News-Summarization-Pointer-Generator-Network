On one frosty, winter evening at Upton Park in January, Alvaro Negredo scored two more goals, bringing up his tally to 23 in his first 33 games for the club.

It was the Manchester City’s striker ninth goal in six games, his confidence overflowing as ‘La Fiera de Vallecas’ – The Beast of Vallecas, the nickname referring to the working class district that Negredo grew up in in Madrid – savaged defences in a barnstorming introduction to English football.

Yet since then: nada. The beast was tamed, his form shuddering to a startling halt, as the bearded Spaniard failed to score again until the end of the season.

Unsettled: Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo wants to return to Spain

Celebration: But picking up the title could be Negredo's last action in a City shirt if he moves away

Appearances: 32 (11 as sub)

Goals: 9

Assists: 3

Shots per match: 1.69

Longest run without a goal: 11 games

Sixteen games and no goals as Negredo traded in his unique blend of brawn and finesse for a brittle and clumsy fragility, losing his place to Edin Dzeko for the Capital One Cup final victory over Sunderland and the crucial title deciders as the clocked ticked down on the Premier League season.

Negredo started just seven of those final sixteen appearances, and completed 90 minutes only once in the 5-0 win over Fulham, almost out of pity as manager Manuel Pellegrini attempted to draw his striker out of the rot.

It was a peculiar narrative and few were able to diagnose the cause of Negredo’s malaise in light of a quite remarkable start to the season.

One theory concerns the knock to the shoulder that Negredo suffered in the 3-0 victory over West Ham, leaving Upton Park with his right arm in a sling.

But Manuel Pellegrini consistently insisted that it was only a brief irritation and it does seem a stretch to hypothesise that this injury has significantly contributed to Negredo’s downturn in form.

Another suggestion from Spain is that amid the adrenalin of his opening months in Manchester, Negredo played beyond all expectations, entering the form of his life and providing a misguided perception of his true credentials.

One source close to his former club Sevilla predicted in December that Negredo’s limitations as a footballer always dictated that a slump would follow the spurt. It seems a harsh appraisal but it has proved startlingly accurate.

Second string: Negredo often found himself as second choice for City behind Edin Dzeko late in the season

Certainly, concerns did emerge at City in the final weeks of the season, as Pellegrini appeared to lose faith in his £20million signing.

In each of the club’s final three Premier League games, every one must-win as City accelerated their pursuit of the Premier League title, Negredo was only introduced after the 85th minute, after the victories had already been sealed.

Negredo had by that point become an apology for the muscular presence that had just weeks earlier terrorised Premier League defences, scoring goals and striking up a potent partnership with Sergio Aguero.

Suddenly, it all looked woefully like labour to him, as if he were a pianist whose timing had deserted hm. He became hesitant in front of goal, jittering, pontificating and losing that defining ability to remain detached when faced by a goalkeeper.

Exclusion from Spain’s final pool of 23 for the World Cup in Brazil soon followed and it is understood that Negredo believes that this struggles in Manchester were responsible, although he also recognises that Pellegrini had little choice but to turn to Dzeko when the heat was on in the final weeks.

It has, rather predictably, led to speculation that the player might be homesick and yearning for the comforts of his native Spain. This, however, does not fit in with the sound bites Negredo had been presenting just a few months earlier.

Nickname: City's number nine hasn't been living up to his 'beast' moniker recently

In an interview with a Sunday newspaper, Negredo could not have been more effusive over his transition from rural Andalucia to the plush greenery of the Cheshire outskirts.

‘I have liked it here right from the first day,’ Negredo said. ‘When you go out in the streets people say hello to you, wish you good morning, it’s a really great feeling.

'People paint England a bit black but you know it is not too bad at all. It is one of the best decisions I have made on a personal level and a football level.’

Football, however, is a fickle profession and a few substitute appearances, a goal drought and international disharmony can do much to change a striker’s feelings these days.

Nonetheless, such a response would be out-of-sync with a player that emerged as one of the most popular both in the dressing-room and on the terraces at the Etihad Stadium last season.

For all the mutual admiration, though, the noises from the Spanish Press appear increasingly convinced that the player would welcome a return to the Iberian peninsula.

Number one: Negredo was the main man for City but became a back up figure late in the season

Down and out: It was a difficult second half to the season for the out-of-sorts striker

City, for their part, insist that they expect the striker to be at the club next season and well-placed source assured Sportsmail on Thursday that the club are not attempting to alter that situation or encourage interest this summer.

Clearly, Pellegrini feels that to cull the striker after twelve months, particularly when his star shone so brightly in the opening part of the campaign, would be a premature and unnecessary response.

What is evident, however, is that Atletico Madrid require a striker to replace Diego Costa and that they may be prepared to test City’s resolve with a bid exceeding £20m in the coming weeks. There is also a growing belief in Spain that Negredo would like a return to his hometown with the Spanish champions.

If Atletico were to follow up the interest with an offer that approached £30m, then City may be forced to seriously reconsider their stance over the 28-year-old’s future, particularly if the player states a desire to leave. 

City remain relaxed about the situation, as the City players return for pre-season in the middle of July, this may be one issues that fills rather more pages of newsprint in the weeks to come.
