A light aircraft has crashed into a mountain while trying to make the tricky descent on to the Caribbean island of St Barts - a popular holiday destination of the rich and famous.

The island's airport - Gustaf III - is considered the third most dangerous in the world because pilots have to descend steeply down over a hilltop on to an extremely short runway - just 650 metres compared to the standard 5,500 metres at international airports - that ends on the beach.

Today there was high wind on the island - where celebrities such as Simon Cowell, Jon Bon Jovi, actress Naomi Watts and model Lily Cole are currently holidaying - making the landing even more treacherous.

The small plane crashed into the side of a mountain as it attempted the steep descent towards the runway. Emergency services were called to the scene but it is not known if anyone was hurt in the crash.

There are currently numerous famous faces sunning themselves on the beautiful island.

Simon Cowell has been spotted with greek actress Zeta Graff enjoying the sun on a luxury superyacht off the coast while Jon Bon Jovi has been making the most of the island's long white beaches with his family.  

American Idol host Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend Julianne Hough were also seen kicking off the New Year in style with a vacation in St Barts.

Difficult: Only the best pilots attempt landing at St Barts which involves a sharp descent over a mountain on to an incredible short runway that finishes on a beach

Salvage operation: A part of the plane is just visible in the trees and bushes growing on the side of the mountain situated next to St Barts' airport

Actress Naomi Watts - who may be 
nominated for an Oscar for her role in The Impossible, a film based on 
the true story of a family who survived the Indian Ocean tsunami - has 
also been enjoying a break from filming to relax with her family on the 
island.

This time of 
year is one of the busiest on the island as many head to St Barts for 
Roman Abramovich's annual New Year's party which normally costs 
millions. 

The Chelsea owner's £1billion yacht
has been anchored off the coast of the island for the last few days 
next to the Al Mirqab - a £150million ship owned by Qatar's Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.

Crash site: Emergency services attended the scene near the village of St Jean in the north of St Barts

Ongoing inquiries: It is not known if anyone was injured in the crash earlier today

The plane was attempting to land on Gustaf III Airport' 650metres long runway - compared to the average 5,500metres long runways used at international airports

The History Channel programme Most Extreme Airports ranks Gustaf III airport, which is often referred to as 'St. Barth's', as the 3rd most dangerous airport in the world.

The airport and the island's main 
town of Gustavia are named for King Gustav III of Sweden, under whom 
Sweden obtained the island from France in 1785 before it was sold back 
to France in 1878.

The airport only serves small regional commercial aircraft and charters - most able to carry fewer than twenty passengers.

Departing
planes often fly right over the heads of sunbathers relaxing on the 
beach at the end of the runway despite small signs warning tourists to 
keep their distance.
