PHILIP LARKIN: LIFE, ART AND LOVE by James Booth (Bloomsbury £25)

This biography begins by stating that Philip Larkin is the best-loved and most quoted English poet of the past century.

I doubt this claim is quite justified — what about Betjeman? But what is true is that his reputation suffered after the publication of his letters in 1992 and Andrew Motion’s ‘official’ biography in 1993.

Larkin had always appealed by being outspoken. Two of his best-known lines are ‘Sexual intercourse began in 1963’ and ‘They f*** you up, your mum and dad’.

Literary great Larkin is often misunderstood in the 21st century according to biographer James Booth

They hardly do justice to his elusive, melancholy, often tender poems — his finer sensibilities were, in turn, contradicted by some of the rude, purposely Philistine letters to friends such as Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest. These were often meant as a joke.

His Eeyore-ish comments on life’s irritations sometimes included casual swipes at immigrants or expressions of warm approval for Enoch Powell.

His biography made it plain he kept at least two women, sometimes more, dangling without intending to marry anyone.

Suddenly, this favourite poet seemed, in private, to have been a selfish, foul-mouthed, lecher with a taste for pornography and racist remarks.

I welcome the way this biography blows away this dark cloud, revealing that it was mainly composed of hot air, misunderstanding and the picky prejudices of ‘political correctness’ of the Nineties.

We really need to know no more than the fact that all Larkin’s friends, lovers and colleagues consulted by James Booth simply do not recognise the ‘Mr Nasty’ version of him. Those close to him remembered him, without exception, as ‘witty, entertaining, considerate and kind’.

Surely some mistake has been perpetrated? After all, the poems, gloomy though some of them are, could hardly have been written by what one critic called ‘the vile mess that was Philip Larkin’. He was an unusual type for a poet. His huge owl-like spectacles beneath a bulging bald dome, coupled with bicycle clips and an overlarge bike, hardly made for a romantic exterior.

Larkin wrote hundreds of heartfelt love letters to his mistress Monica Jones, evidence he was not a misogynist

He also had a bad stammer that made him shun public appearances and readings.

It was thought puzzling that he spent his working life as a librarian — and most of that at the University of Hull, far from the centre of the literary scene.

But nothing could have suited him better. He enjoyed his work, just as T. S. Eliot enjoyed working in a bank. He was an efficient administrator, overseeing a magnificent new library.

As for Hull, he liked its dullness (‘very nice and flat for cycling’) and inaccessibility at the end of the railway line: ‘People can’t get at you’. It suited him to be the hermit of Hull because he could get on with his poems.

If this makes him sound a cheerless recluse, it was relieved by the almost wholly female library staff, for whom he was a lively and much-fancied boss.

Secretary Betty Mackereth had a relationship with Philip Larkin for 18 years

There is a photo in which Larkin sits in front of two rows of eagerly smiling girl assistants. Two of them became his mistresses.

Sexually, Larkin was a late starter. He waited years for his first love, Ruth Bowman, to grow out of her school days; they reached sexual consummation as she took her Finals. He got to the point of proposing to her, only to withdraw the proposal two days later, when he promptly departed to a new library job in Belfast.

He wrote beautiful thank-you-and-goodbye letters — ‘Oh dear, oh dear, you were wonderful’ or ‘Our two years were the most wonderful I’ve known’.

You can almost hear the relief with which he used the past tense. His unyielding motive in love affairs was to avoid lifelong commitment.

He was not, as some have suggested, a misogynist, but a misogamist, a hater of marriage — something inside refused to let him tie the knot. He suffered feelings of guilt because of it. At Leicester University he became entangled with a lecturer of flamboyant style called Monica Jones. Her emphatic spectacles and intelligence matched his own.

When new jobs separated them the affair carried on in the way he seemed to have preferred — by correspondence. He wrote hundreds of letters.

When he got to Hull things were complicated by the addition of Maeve Brennan, a library assistant who worshipped him. Because of her strict Roman Catholic principles, she tried to stop short of pre-marital sex (but seems to have yielded on occasion).

For years this triangle chimed uneasily on. He admitted he was a self-centred person ‘conducting an affair with one girl, getting mixed up with another, heedless of the feelings of either’. His excuse was that both women were dependent on him and ‘kindness’ stopped him dismissing either. ‘It is my unwillingness to give myself to anyone that’s at fault — like promising to stand on one leg for the rest of your life’.

What was not at fault was his determination to put poetry before everything. For poetry he needed regular solitude. And from time to time most poets seek a fresh muse.

Both women knew of each other’s existence, but neither wanted to be free of him. To this menage, he was to add a third. His relations with Betty Mackereth, his secretary, had lasted 18 years when suddenly, in their 50s, it became physical — much to her surprise (‘We were good buddies’).

Booth explores these emotional shifts and complexities fairly and sympathetically. Why Larkin should have been condemned for them beats me. All the women were free to leave, but they stayed close until he died.

Much of the book is about the finest of his poems, which Booth submits to technical analysis as well as appreciation, rather more of it perhaps than the general reader requires.

As a man, Larkin emerges by no means whiter than white. As he put it in a ‘Glum Letter’ to Monica: ‘God! Some day someone will perhaps explain what went wrong. I can’t believe I am so much more unpleasant than anyone else.’

He wasn’t — and he isn’t now.
