Every woman dreams their partner will take them to the dizzy heights and for Shannon Sabourin, that came true - literally.

Her now husband Rossel Sabourin planned the ultimate proposal, high on a mountaintop overlooking a stunning lake in the remote Canadian Rockies - but all while enjoying a gourmet feast complete with white linen cloth and a bottle of Champagne on ice.

Rossel then popped the question - and thankfully she said, 'yes', later describing the magical moment as 'an unreal surprise'.

In June 2012 the pair were innkeepers at a lodge  and staff helped carry a table, food and chairs to the peak

The couple, from Winnepeg, Canada, who are now married, have unveiled the pictures of their breathtaking proposal in July 2012 to inspire other couples to make their engagements as special as possible.

They took their first trip to Bow Lake in the Rocky Mountains in 2008 and in 2010 they became fulltime innkeepers at the Num-Ti-Jah Lodge in Banff National Park.

Both outdoorsy and keen on hiking, climbing and caoeing, Rossel schemed to create the perfect engagement moment - with stunning photos to match.

Shannon, who had no idea what awaited her at the end of their climb, wrote on Facebook: 'Never expected this reward after climbing to the peak!! What an unreal surprise!! I'm an incredibly lucky lady.' 

Rossel posted on his Facebook page: 'It was amazing and the view wasn't bad either!' He added, 'A special girl needs a special spot'. 

Despite the summer day, the pair were wrapped up in windbreakers and Shannon, a respiratory therapist, was clad in a woolly bobble hat.

Marketing executive Rossel had a table, chairs, linens and a gourmet spread of cheese, crackers and chocolate - including glasses, an ice-bucket and stand brought to the top of Little Crowfoot Mountain. 

The couple then dined overlooking the stunning green-tinged water, with their table seeming to teeter on the edge of an almost sheer drop with nothing but snow-covered rock face between them and the the lake, 9,000ft below.

Rossel also involved his friend, photographer Paul Ziska, who captured the breathtaking shots from different points on the mountain to get a sense of the sheer scale of the couple's tiny table perched on the mountain.

Rossel and Shannon married in October, 2012, and the pair, who have a labrador called Pearl, are expecting their first baby.
