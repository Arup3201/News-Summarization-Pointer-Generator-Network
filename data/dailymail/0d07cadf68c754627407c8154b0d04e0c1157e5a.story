A businessman accused of murder after he stabbed a drug-crazed burglar to death during a bungled raid was vindicated of all wrongdoing by a coroner today.

Homeowner Vincent Cooke, 41, had been arrested after career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, suffered up to nine knife wounds as he broke into Cooke's luxury four bedroom home in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester.

During the raid, Jacob and an accomplice held a knife to the throat of a terrified Mr Cooke saying: 'We will f****** slit your throat, get your money, get your jewellery - we will kill you.'

They then frogmarched him upstairs to his study and then to his kitchen in a search for jewellery and a large quantity of cash.

But when the victim’s wife Karen, 36, and 14-year-old son Anthony returned home from a football tournament, Mr Cooke grabbed a carving knife from the kitchen and repeatedly stabbed Jacob during a violent struggle.

Mr Cooke - who said he acted in lawful self defence - was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge, but was kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged.

He and his family have been forced to quit their luxury home due to them suffering nightmares about the tragedy almost 18 months ago.

It emerged the raiders had been given information about Mr Cooke’s safe from the victim’s uncle who helped him run a transport storage firm.

Last year Jacob’s accomplice Michael Thorpe, 34, of Heald Green, Stockport, Greater Manchester, was jailed for ten years after admitting aggravated burglary.

The coroner John Pollard backed Mr Cooke after hearing him insist he used reasonable force against the burglar at an inquest into Jacob’s death amid a large police security operation at Stockport coroners court.

Mr Pollard also dismissed attempts by Thorpe to smear Mr Cooke’s integrity after the thug was brought from jail to give evidence.

Recording a narrative verdict the coroner said: 'Vincent Cooke was terrified by the two men, both of them had knives and we know that a knife was found on Mr Jacob.

'Vincent Cooke, inside his own home, is entitled to be very fearful and entitled to use reasonable and appropriate force to protect him family and his property.

'I note that he and Mr Jacob were having a knife fight and he was fighting for his life. I also note that Mr Jacob obtained nine knife wounds and Vincent Cooke only one.

'Mr Jacob had a considerable amount of drugs including alcohol in his system and you could see how this could make him react.

'One thing is certain is that it would have had an affect on slowing his reactions and making it more difficult to strike and defend himself as a sober man would and this would account for the disparity of injuries.

'I have little doubt that Mr Jacob went with Mr Thorpe to commit a burglary or robbery, equipped and prepared to use a knife or knives to threaten Vincent Cooke and his family.

'The householder is entitled to use reasonable force to defend himself.'

The tragedy occurred in September 2011 when Mr Cooke, who had been at his £350,000 home watching TV, answered a knock at his front door

There stood a man in a high-visibility jacket claimed to be from the gas board, but Jacob and Thorpe suddenly burst in.

Mr Cooke, a former director of a delivery firm, said: 'I thought Karen had forgotten her keys and I put on a daft voice saying: "Who is it?".

Then I could make out high-vis colours and a voice replied back "gas". I had no reason to doubt that they were not officials but the door flew open so much so that I flew backwards and two men rushed in and shouted "customs".

'One had a blue-coloured clipboard and tried to pretend it was formal paperwork, when I tried to say "can I have a look a that " and see some identification they said, "no, you are being robbed mate".

'They both pulled out knives and grabbed hold of me on either side and that was it I was under their control.

'Their first words once they dropped the act were "no police, no alarms or you are dead. Where is your wife and son? Give us your money, give us your jewellery, the Rolex".’

'They pulled the knives from their midriffs and brandished them throughout, they shouted "upstairs upstairs".

'One was on my left, the other on my right with the knives at the side of my throat, being frogmarched.

'I tried telling them several times that I had no money and pointed out that I was just a van driver. They were demanding £40,000, I didn’t have any money.'

'They said :"We know you have money,  we have paid for this information we will f****** slit your throat, get your money, get your jewellery, we will kill you, we will kill you".

'I suppose anyone going past our home might think we were well off but that was far from the truth, we were an average family earning average wages and paying off a mortgage.

'I pleaded with them to leave, I said my wife and kid would be back shortly. I thought if I told them they would have some humanity.'

He told them that there was a safe downstairs but there was nothing in it. He was forced back downstairs at knifepoint, while Thorpe was upstairs.

In his statement Mr Cooke said that he went back to the kitchen and he glanced to the left and he saw his wife in the kitchen doorway.

Her sudden appearance shocked Jacob.

Mr Cooke said: 'He didn’t know what to do at first and looked at Karen and then looked at me and lunged at me with the knife he had.

'I grabbed a knife from the block in the kitchen and ran at him and knocked him to the ground. It was the closest thing to me.

'I barged at him, I didn’t stab him straight away. I tried to disarm him but as we crashed into the hallway, I remember thinking: "You need to get to your feet".

'It was a matter of who could get to their feet first, we both got up.

'It was a knife fight then, who could stab each other first, we were both brandishing knives at each other.

'He was stabbing with his knife and I was stabbing with mine, we were both just basically trying to stab each other. It was a knife fight and it was horrible.

'I felt if I wasn’t quicker than him he would stab and kill me. I didn’t know where my wife and son were.

'Then I heard her screaming and at first I thought Thorpe had thrown Anthony into the back of the van because it drove off at speed.'

Jacob suffered superficial wounds to his arm, wrist and knee but sustained a fatal wound to his thigh which severed a vital artery.  He bled to death whilst attempting to flee the scene.

Tests showed he had traces in his bloodstream of alcohol, methadone, morphine, codeine, cocaine, diazepam, caffeine and nicotine. He had previously been on heroin.

The villain had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft and once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'.

During the hearing Mr Cooke dismissed as 'ludicrous' claims Thorpe had visited the house previously.

Police said there was no evidence of previous contact between them.
