Xavi has broken a Champions League record after making his 143rd appearance in the competition for Barcelona on Tuesday night.

The 34-year-old midfielder replaced Ivan Rakitic in the 69th minute against PSG at the Parc des Princes.

Xavi, who also has three winners medals, has surpassed Real Madrid icon Raul, who made 142 appearances.

Former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs made 151 appearances, but 10 of those were in qualifying rounds.

However, Xavi's new record could be under threat straight away with Iker Casillas set to play his 141st game in the competition for Real Madrid against Basel.

The Spanish midfielder has also been ousted from Luis Enrique's team of late, with new signing Rakitic and Andres Iniesta usually preferred.

Xavi is one of the most successful players in the competition's history, helping the club lift the competition in 2006, 2009 and 2011.
