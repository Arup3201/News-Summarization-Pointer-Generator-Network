A two-week-long partial government shutdown originally blamed on a conservative Republicans' demands for Obamacare to be defunded is now stalling because liberal Democrats want to see an end to planned spending cuts, it emerged today.

Obama has consistently insisted that he is not willing to pay a Republican 'ransom' as the deadlock continued but the reversal will see many Americans wondering who's the real aggressor in the fiscal 'hostage-taking' that the White House has decried for nearly a month. 

A budget impasse earlier in the year led to the so-called budget 'sequester' which walled off tens of billions of dollars in planned spending. Now Senate Democrats are demanding its complete rollback, in an audacious move that many in the GOP are seeing as a greedy overreach.

Hard to swallow: Republicans will be angered by the bold demand from the Democrats after Obama, pictured at a foodbank in D.C. today. has for the last month said he would not pay a 'ransom'

Federal government workers are tired of being furloughed because of the 13-day-old partial shutdown, but Senate Democrats have scuttled a hoped-for solution with new demands that would see Uncle Sam breaking the bank with new spending records

The White House issued a statement on Monday saying that Obama would remind congressional leaders in the Oval Office at 3pm that he 'will not pay a ransom for Congress reopening the government and raising the debt limit.'

That meeting was postponed about 20 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. The White House released a statement saying the action was taken 'to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress towards a solution that raises the debt limit and reopens the government.

Some observers are saying the hastily scheduled meeting will be a session of liars' poker whose stakes are half fiscal and half political.

'This whole shutdown has been completely unnecessary,' Obama told reporters during an unscheduled stop Monday afternoon at a Washington, D. C. soup kitchen, complaining that ''we've seen this brinksmanship time and time again to try and extract extreme partisan concessions.'

On Saturday, leading senators from both parties were poised to announce a deal based on a proposal from Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican. 

The plan called for a debt-ceiling extension through the end of January and a six-month federal budget agreement at levels set by the January sequester. Also included were a two-year delay of the controversial medical-device tax under Obamacare, and a mechanism to verify the incomes of Americans claiming Obamacare-related subsidies.

Then, according to Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, Democrats 'moved the goalposts in light of ... polling data' that showed they could extract more concessions from Republican senators – in addition to the collapse of 'defund' and 'delay' Obamacare demands.

'We were ready to go to the press gallery' to announce a deal, McCain said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation program. 'The Democrat leadership said no.'

The always-understated Collins told CNN's Candy Crowley on the State Of The Union program that she was 'very surprised' to see Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reject her plan at the last minute. 'I don't think it was very constructive,' she said.

Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was more pointed, noting in a statement Sunday that Reid had already succeeded in forcing House Republicans to abandon their immediate hope of seeing Obamacare gutted.

'It's time for Democrat leaders to take "yes" for an answer,' McConnell said.

Sen. Susan Collins (L) is steamed that Democrats have shot down her grand bargain, but it's Sen. John McCain (R) who seems more animated, saying liberals have 'moved the goalposts' and shifted the debate from Obamacare to new spending hikes

Senate Republicans have been basing their negotiations on the idea that annual federal spending would be capped at $967 billion, the number resulting from January's sequester cuts. In the House, the GOP has aimed at a slightly higher number – $988 billion – which was proposed last year by then-vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin chairman of the House Budget Committee.

Senate Democrats now say they want a budget that spends $1.058 trillion, even as President Barack Obama claims to be presiding over a federal government in which annual deficits have steadily decreased.

U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says he's tired of making concessions and getting still more demands in return" 'It's time for Democrat leaders to take "yes" for an answer'

The result has left some Republicans in the House feeling like they can't trust the Senate to shoot straight.

'This is getting ridiculous,' a senior House GOP aide told MailOnline on Monday. 'I hate to think our own guys in the Senate are jerking us around, but it's clear that at least the Senate Democrats are. I think they're reaching too far. And if Senate Republicans follow them off a cliff, we're not going to reach out a hand to pull them back this time.'

Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters on Sunday that he's confident Democrats will get most of what they want..

'We are not overplaying our hand,' Schumer said. 'We are open to discussion in every way, and I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction.'

Some in the GOP are quietly saying they would accept a rollback of the sequester-related cuts – principally those connected to defense spending – but only if they were matched dollar-for-dollar by new cuts in entitlement spending.

Democrats say that's a non-starter.

And even if the two sides in the Senate should reach a compromise, there's no telling how the more conservative House Republicans would view it.

Schumer  said Sunday that the impasse could last awhile: 'We're not going to overcome it in the next day or two.'

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham left a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner on Saturday, ready to do battle in the Sunday TV talk wars. 'You own Obamacare,' he would tell Democrats, 'and it¿s going to be a political gift that keeps on giving'

Republicans, meanwhile, have seized on the 2013 sequester budget cuts and their underlying 2011 budget law in the same way Democrats have defended the 2010 Affordable Care Act – by insisting that it's settled law.

'It's funny," Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul said Sunday on CNN. 'They're all about Obamacare being the law of the land, but so's the sequester. If we exceed that, it's real big step in the wrong direction.'

Rand Paul thinks it's 'funny' how Democrats insist Obamacare is 'the law of the land' but don't treat the budget 'sequester' with the same deference

'I can't imagine you're going to get Senate Republicans to vote for something that exceeds the sequester caps. I think it's a huge mistake for the country.'

Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker said on Fox News Sunday that 'the Democrats are on the verge of being one tick too cute as they see the House possibly in disarray. They now are overreaching.'

Lawmakers have precious few days left to talk turkey: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that the federal government may not be able to pay its debt obligations as soon as Thursday, unless Congress authorizes an increase in the debt ceiling.

And while Republicans are – so far –  unwilling to give up political ground on spending, they have all but abandoned their earlier Obamacare-related demands which sparked the current debt and budget crises.

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on ABC's This Week that Democrats should be prepared to take responsibility for Obamacare's failures and, perhaps, for its eventual collapse.

'To our Democratic friends,' he said, 'you own Obamacare, and it’s going to be a political gift that keeps on giving. So the shutdown will be old news next year, Obamacare’s faults will be front and center in 2014 – if we don’t screw this up.'

'What breaks my heart is, [in] the last 12 days you’ve had a complete meltdown of the portal called Obamacare. The whole system [is] just not working.'

And, he said with regret, by allowing themselves to be dragged into a sequester-related Round Two of the budget crisis, Republicans are 'overshadowing how badly Obamacare has been rolled out.'

Obama once complained that Republicans were holding the White House for 'ransom,' but now it's Democrats who could bluff their way to victory

Dems seek budget hikes on entitlement spending, and hope to win a short-term reopening of government to allow for a new negotiation soon

The GOP has all but abandoned its hope of rolling back Obamacare, and will likely only win token concessions as the debt-ceiling deadline looms

Poll numbers show more of the public is blaming Republicans than Democrats for the partial shutdown, which kicked in Oct. 1
