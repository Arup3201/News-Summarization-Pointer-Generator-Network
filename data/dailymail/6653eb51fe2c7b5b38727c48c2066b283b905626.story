A New Hampshire woman accused of jumping out a second-story window with her baby twins, killing one and severely injuring the other, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

Patina Welch, 29, from Lyman, told investigators there were men with guns in her house trying to kill her boy-girl twins and she was trying to save them, reports WMUR-TV. 

Her son, who was four-months-old, died from his injuries after she landed on him and her now one-year-old daughter was severely injured.

The 29-year-old Lyman resident Patina Welch told investigators there were men with guns in her house trying to kill her boy-girl twins and she was trying to save them

A psychiatrist testified last month that Welch was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and was psychotic when she jumped last summer.

People with schizoaffective disorder experience a combination of the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 

Moods can swing from deep depression to extreme elation while at the same time causing sufferers to have hallucinations, or even make them paranoid that inanimate objects such as a television are trying to harm them.

The baby boy was taken to a local hospital, but he died from his injuries.His sister was treated for her injuries and was released in July (both babies are pictured here, but not being held by Welch)

The attorney general's office says Welch has struggled with mental health problems since she was 13.

A dangerousness hearing is scheduled for April 8 - it will determine if she should be committed to the state secure psychiatric ward.

If a person has symptoms of psychosis and symptoms of a mood disorder, this diagnosis is given.

People with schizoaffective disorder experience a combination of the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 

Moods can swing from deep depression to extreme elation while at the same time causing sufferers to have hallucinations, or even make them paranoid that inanimate objects such as a television are trying to harm them. 

Schizoaffective disorder usually begins in the late teen years or early adulthood, often between the ages of 16 and 30.

Officials said that on the day before the incident, family and friends told investigators Welch was delusional and paranoid, saying she thought people were trying to hurt her, reports WCVB. 

Prosecutors say police received a 911 call from a couple in Lyman, a town of 550 people in northwest New Hampshire, reporting their son was in medical distress. 

An emergency crew responded to Welch's home at 4:50 a.m. on June 18 and discovered that the male infant was in 'medical distress.' 

The baby boy was taken to a local hospital, but he died from his injuries.

His sister was treated for her injuries and was released in July.

WCVB reports that the little girl is doing well and now living with family.

In June, Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeff Strelzin identified the occupants of the home as Linda Tellier, Trevor McGuire and Welch.

He also said McGuire and Welch were the parents of the twins, who were not identified by the attorney general's office. 

Welch threw the twins out of this window. Welch also jumped out of the window and landed on her son, who died from his injuries

Welch is scheduled for a hearing April 8 to determine if she should be committed to the state secure psychiatric ward
