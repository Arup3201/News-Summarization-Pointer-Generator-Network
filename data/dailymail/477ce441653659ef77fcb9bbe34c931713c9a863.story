Amir Khan has dangled the lucrative carrot of another British blockbuster in front of bitter rival Kell Brook - if the Sheffield welterweight can dethrone world champion Shawn Porter.

Brook is currently being put through his paces in Spain as he awaits a date to face the IBF ruler on the other side of the Atlantic.

And Khan, who made an impressive debut at the weight against Luis Collazo in May, believes the much vaunted domestic dust-up could become a reality within 12 months.

‘He has his hands full with Shawn Porter but if he wins then he could definitely be an opponent in the future,’ Khan told the Sheffield Star.

‘Kell has to prove himself first. He has to do that against someone credible.

‘I can actually see him not even taking the fight (with Porter) but if he does then fair play, I take my hat off to him and wish him all the best.

‘If he wins then it’s worth me an him getting inside the ring at some point within a year.’

Brook has been frustrated by Porter’s delaying tactics since the 26-year-old from Ohio was ordered to face the unbeaten Brit.

His promoter Eddie Hearn wrote in his Sportsmail column: ‘Kell Brook and I have had to endure some rubbish floating around in the media in the last few days.

‘The situation is simple. On June 16, we signed the provision of service agreements and the IBF bout agreement to fight Shawn Porter with a proposed date of August 9 but no later than September 7.

‘The provision of services agreement was sent back fully executed and when I contacted the IBF on Monday night, they told me Porter has not sent his bout agreement but that they received ours on June 16.’

The fight looks unlikely to take place on August 9 however after Golden Boy announced a triple world title bill for the same night.
