When Kate Moss unveiled her first collection for Topshop by posing in the window of the Oxford Street store she caused a storm.

The 2007 collaboration, which was extraordinarily successful, marked the beginning of the trend for myriad large-scale celebrity collaborations with high street stores still going strong today.

But, three years after it started, the partnership came to an end.

Now though, Kate is back at Topshop as the store reveal that a new collection designed by the supermodel is underway.

Enduring friendship: Kate Moss sat front row with Sir Philip Green at his Unique catwalk show during London Fashion Week last month

The first time round: Kate Moss with Sir Philip at the launch of her first collection for Topshop back in 2007

The store announced the return this morning with the words: 'Kate Moss is confirmed to return to the brand to deliver a new take on her style inspirations and unrivalled position as THE true British fashion icon', adding that with the level of interest and energy around London as a fashion capital and British style generally, they and Kate Moss felt the time was right to 'recollaborate and celebrate British fashion'.

'This new phase in this partnership highlights the great close working relationship betweenTopshop and Kate Moss and is the culmination of two great British establishments coming together,' a Topshop spokesman said.

Sir Philip Green said he was 'personally thrilled' that Kate was keen to come back to Topshop.

'The first time around was such a lot of
 fun and she has been sorely missed.

'The Topshop business  has developed
 extensively around the globe since we launched with Kate in 2007, and 
it's our intention to launch and sell this collection in all 40 
countries worldwide where Topshop has a presence, in addition to 
creating pop-ups in department stores around the globe'.

Delighted: Both Sir Philip and Kate said they are thrilled to be reviving the successful partnership they enjoyed when working together

For her part Kate Moss says she is delighted to be back in the fold, saying she missed being on board.

'I am very excited to create a new collection that bears my name. Now more than ever with London being at the forefront of fashion as it feels like I’m back home working with Topshop.

'I have really missed being involved in the design process, and working with the team,' she said.

Kate Phelan, Topshop's creative director, added that Kate would be bringing 'star quality' to Topshop.  'Kate is a fashion superstar who sets the trends and influences style,' she said. 'I am looking forward to working with her.'

The store says that their creative teams are 'working closely' with Kate and her longtime friend and collaborator Katy England on a multi-platform launch campaign set to hit stores in April. 

The Kate Moss Collection for SS14 will be sold globally across 40 countries as well as on the Topshop website.
