Thousands voiced their support for Nigella on Twitter yesterday – and she rewarded them with a ‘Holiday Hotcake’ recipe.

Her fans offered their support at the rate of about 500 tweets a minute.

Nigella posted a link to her recipe for Holiday Hotcake with Eggnog Cream, and wrote: ‘The perfect recipe to show thanks for all your support & to those who hashtag teamNigella’.

The message was retweeted hundreds of times in the hours after she posted it.

Messages of support poured in for the celebrity cook, who has more than 470,000 followers on Twitter.

The hashtag ‘teamNigella’ was quickly been adopted by her fans, amid allegations from her ex-husband Charles Saatchi that she was a habitual cocaine user.

Fellow cookery writer Tom Parker Bowles tweeted: ‘Hypocrisy, bile and bulls***. @Nigella_Lawson will always rock. Wonderful writer, brilliant cook #TeamNigella’

TV host Piers Morgan said: ‘This relentless beating up on @Nigella_Lawson - in every sense - is disgusting. She’s a lovely lady, who’s been through hell in her life.’ 

Rosa Monckton, Princess Diana’s friend and Miss Lawson’s sister-in-law, wrote: ‘A man scorned is much more dangerous than a woman.’ 

Fan Peter Rush tweeted: ‘Nigella, your reputation remains untarnished for me and millions of others too’, while Stuart Nathan wrote: ‘Nigella Lawson brought us the caramel croissant pudding. Charles Saatchi brought us the Thatcher government’.

Piers Morgan said Nigella had been through hell in life following the deaths of her husband, mother and sister

Dawn O'Porter jumped to Nigella's defence saying she would support the TV cook no matter what

Another supporter, Ruth Cherry, said: ‘Seriously, other than Charles Saatchi, is there anyone who isn’t TeamNigella?’ It is not the first time Miss Lawson has enlisted the support of a wider community of well-wishers.

Miss Lawson revealed Team Cupcake in back 2010 - the affectionate name for the group of assistants who help look after her children and make sure her business is running smoothl
