The Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation after an artillery shell fired during a training exercise on Salisbury Plain went five miles off course and exploded in a field close to a railway line.

The shell flew over the busy A342 road and the entire village of Chirton in Wiltshire, before landing just 300 yards from the mainline Paddington to Penzance train track, which carries thousands of passengers every day.

The explosive, which was fired either by large AS-90 locomotive artillery or a L118 105mm light gun howitzer, left a six foot wide crater in a farmer's field - scattering earth and rock up to 40ft.

Distance: The shell flew over the busy A342 road and the entire village of Chirton in Wiltshire, before landing in a farmer's field just 300 yards from the mainline Paddington to Penzance train track

Weapon: The explosive may have been fired by a L118 105mm light gun howitzer (pictured)

Salisbury Plain is used extensively by the army for ground, air and tank training. The military training area covers roughly half of the plain's 300 square miles, with a major railway line running close by

Farmer Andrew Snook, 55, found the shell in the centre of a deep hole in his field and says it was pure luck nobody was killed.

After demanding an apology from the Ministry of Defence, he said: 'There was a lot of heavy firing going on and this one blast did really make me wince.'

'I thought, that’s close and people in the village said they thought it landed right next to the farm but we couldn’t find it anywhere,' he added.

'It must have come over a couple of villages to get here. If it would have landed in a village it would have been a very different story,' Mr Snook went on.

Salisbury Plain covers 300 square miles and is used extensively by the army for ground, air and tank training.

Location: This aerial view of the village of Patney shows the farmer's field in which the shell landed. The explosive came within 300 yards of a mainline railway line

Danger: The shell landed just 300 yards from the mainline Paddington to Penzance train track, which carries thousands of passengers from London to south west England every day

Probe: Farmer Andrew Snook talks to a member of the Army's Range Command after an artillery round landed in his field. He says the Ministry of Defence have been investigating the incident of his farm since Saturday

A military training area covers roughly half the plain, but the shortest distance between the Salisbury Plain Training Area and the field in which the shell was discovered is three miles.

The rogue shell was fired last Wednesday but Mr Snook did not discover the crater in his maize field until the Friday.

Mr Snook says
 the explosive must have travelled over the A342 road and the village of 
Chirton - population 250 - before reaching his farm in Patney near 
Devizes.

The father-of-two said: 'We live about three miles from the edge of the firing range and around five miles from where they are usually training, so it’s come quite a way.'

'We found it on the Friday and we called the MoD [Ministry of Defence]. They came out on Saturday and started investigating - what type of shell it was and where it has come from,' he added.

'They tried to find out exactly what it was but I don’t think they really know - if they did they didn’t tell me... It's a field that I will soon be putting down to maize so it hasn’t damaged a crop, but I want an apology,' Mr Snook went on to say. 

Range: Large AS-90 locomotive artillery were also used during the live firing exercises. Mr Snook says the explosive must have travelled over the A342 road and the village of Chirton before reaching his farm

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence confirmed that an investigation into the incident was under way, adding: 'We can confirm 
that during live firing on Salisbury Plain Training Area last week an 
artillery shell landed outside the range boundary.

'No one was injured and no property was damaged but all live firing has been suspended while this is investigated,' he added.

The exact spot from where the shot was fired is yet to be established, but several army units were scheduled to be training in the area last week.

Both 4 and 19 Regiments Royal Artillery, 7 Parachute Regiment Royal House Artillery, Kings Royal Hussars Challenger 2 squadron and a CVRT squadron were using the plain on March 5.

During a week of live firing exercises across the plain, the troops were using large AS-90 locomotive artillery and L118 105mm light gun howitzers.
