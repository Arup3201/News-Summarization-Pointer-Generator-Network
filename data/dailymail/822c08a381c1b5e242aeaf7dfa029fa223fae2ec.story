Hero: Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who admitted in a letter that he suffered seasickness

Famed for his fearless leadership during the Napoleonic war, Admiral Horatio Nelson is undoubtedly a national hero.

But a letter sent from Nelson's flagship the HMS Victory has revealed that even the inspirational commander occasionally struggled with life at sea.

In the previously unseen letter which has gone on display at the Tunbridge Wells Museum and Art Gallery, Admiral Nelson confesses to being seasick.

Nelson wrote the letter to the 2nd Earl of Camden in October 1804 to explain why his nephew had left the HMS Victory just a few months after joining the Navy.  

He wrote: 'I am ill every time it blows hard and nothing but my enthusiastic love for the profession keeps me one hour at sea.'

It was sent to Lord Camden's home at Bayham Abbey estate, near Frant, East Sussex, and Nelson tells Lord Camden that 16-year-old Francis James left HMS Victory because he was not suited to naval life and suffered from seasickness - a condition he could sympathise with.

Now the letter has gone on display at Tunbridge Wells Museum.

In the letter, which was found recently in the Camden family archives, Nelson also discusses the military and political situation with Lord Camden, who was secretary of state for war and the colonies at the time.

A spokeswoman for Tunbridge Wells Museum said the letter was 'hugely important because of its historical context'.

She added 'The letter was written in October 1804 from HMS Victory in the Mediterranean where Nelson was permanently stationed to counter French influence.

'This was just a year before his great victory - and death - at the Battle of Trafalgar.

'The letter links Admiral Horatio Nelson with the local noble Camden family who lived on the Bayham Abbey estate.

'It also gives a fascinating insight into the character of this great naval hero.'

In November a letter from Nelson to his lover Lady Emma Hamilton was sold at auction for £20,000.

The Nelson letter has been chosen for display by Mike Bevan, Assistant Archivist at the National Maritime Museum.

Experts there were excited to learn about this new discovery and have helped to put it in its historical context.

The letter is on long-term loan to the museum from the Camden family.

HMS Victory was launched in 1765 at Chatham Dockyard and was used in active duty for 34 years from 1778.

It is the only surviving warship that fought in the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars.

The first rate 100 gun ship was designed by the Surveyor of the Navy, Sir Thomas Slade.

The famous ship became the fladship of a string of fine Admirals including Admiral Keppel, Admiral Kempenfelt, Admiral Hood and Admiral Sir John Jervis.

But it wasn't until May 1803 that the ship became synonymous with Admiral Horatio Nelson.

With the threat of invasion by Napoleon causing renewed hostility with France, the ship carried the newly appointed Commander in Chief Nelson to the Mediterranean on May 16.

For the next 18 months Nelson blockaded the French fleet in Toulon to prevent them escaping to join forces with other squadrons based on France's Atlantic arsenals.

Its finest hour came at the Battle of trafalgar in 1805. In September 1805, the Victory sailed with Nelson from Portsmouth to join a blockading fleet under Collingwood off Cadiz.

French commander Villeneuve's orders were to take the combined Franco-Spanish fleet into the Mediterranean.

On October 18 1805 frigates signalled that the enemy were weighing anchor. Villeneuve's fleet, now comprising 33 ships of the line, headed for Gibraltar but, unable to shake off the British fleet, turned back for Cadiz and inevitable combat.

As day broke on Monday 21 October 1805, off Cape Trafalgar, Nelson's fleet of 27 ships formed into two columns and sailed towards the enemy. Battle commenced with Collingwood's division breaching the rear of the enemy fleet.

Nelson in Victory followed shortly, driving into the centre and opening a devastating fire into the stern of Villeneuve's flagship Bucentaure.

Victory then engaged and grappled the Redoutable. But when the fighting was at its fiercest, Nelson was shot by a French marksman and taken below where he died at later the same afternoon.

By this time the enemy had been routed and a great victory won.

17 ships had been captured and one, the French Achille, blew up as a finale to the battle. The French battle-fleet was never again a threat.

Much damaged, the Victory was towed to Gibraltar and finally returned to Portsmouth, arriving on December 4 1805, bearing her dead Admiral.

After repairs at Chatham, the Victory was recommissioned in March 1808. For the next 4 years she was on active service in the Baltic and off the coasts of Spain.

In 1812, now 47 years old, she finally returned to Portsmouth on December 4 and paid off 16 days later, ending her sea-going life.

For the next 110 years the Victory remained at her moorings in Portsmouth Harbour fulfilling a combination of practical and ceremonial roles.

In 1922, amid fears for her continued survival, the Victory was moved into Portsmouth's Royal Naval Dockyard and placed in No2 Dry Dock. Work then began on restoring the Victory to her 'fighting' 1805 condition and continues today.
