Since the Republic of Ireland succumbed to a last-16 penalty shoot-out defeat by Spain in the 2002 World Cup, they are the only nation from the British Isles other than England to have since qualified for a a major tournament since.

In fact, more correctly, all five of the nations who make up the British Isles - the Republic of Ireland is not part of the United Kingdom but is in the British Isles - hold realistic ambitions of reaching the expanded European Championship tournament in France in 2016.

It is for that reason that when Ireland travel to Celtic Park to face Scotland on Friday night, the game will be of huge significance to the potential fortunes of both sides.

Gordon Strachan leads Scotland out at Celtic Park, a ground he used to call home for four years with Celtic 

A win for Gordon Strachan's Scotland side would propel them level  with Martin O'Neill's team on seven points - a total Germany will inevitably reach when they hammer Gibraltar - while victory for Ireland will see them move three clear at the top.

In reference to the sheer magnitude of this fixture, Sportsmail looks at the 10 reasons why this is the biggest fixture on British soil for years... 

1) Roy Maurice Keane (and O’Neill)

Mr Keane livens up any occasion and you can guarantee he will be fired up for this one.

Ireland have already been forced to come out and deny that their assistant manager was involved in an alleged scrap at their team hotel and he will be in the dugout at Celtic Park.

The former Manchester United and Nottingham Forest midfielder lives and breathes every kick - so it will be fascinating to see how he reacts when he returns to Celtic Park with an away side alongside O'Neill, who will experience an emotional homecoming too.

2) It will be the largest home attendance for Scotland international in 25 years

Celtic Park will be packed to the rafters with a capacity crowd of 60,832 screaming their support during this match.

With Hampden still being converted back to a football stadium following the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, the fixture has been shifted to Celtic's home ground.

Scotland have not had a home crowd north of 60,000 since the middle of the 1980s - showing how pumped up both sets of fans are for this one. 

It will be the largest home attendances for a Scotland international in more than 25 years on Friday

3) Celtic Park will be rocking

There’s no running track and gentle incline of the stands that blight Hampden at Friday night's venue, that's for certain.

If you have experienced a big European night at Celtic Park, you will understand the unique atmosphere it generates.

The noise of the crowd will hang in the Glasgow air and make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 

Celtic Park offers a unique atmosphere, like when they hosted Barcelona in the Champions League

4) Both sides 'could' achieve the unthinkable and knock Germany out

OK, OK, it's a long shot - but it is not entirely outside the realms of possibility.

World champions Germany have been suffering something of a post-conquering hangover in this Euro qualifying campaign so far. They sneaked past Scotland 2-1, they were comfortably dispatched 2-0 by Poland and then snatched a late draw against Ireland in their last match.

If Scotland, Ireland and Poland keep picking up points, Joachim Low's team may fail to make it to France. 

Ireland and Scotland could knock world champions Germany out of the competition in qualification

5) Ikechi Anya is Premier League bound

The 26-year-old is extremely exciting and one way or another Watford’s flying winger is coming to a Premier League ground near you next season.

Two goals have already arrived in nine internationals but he offers so much more than that.

As well as creating and scoring, Anya has that X-factor to him that sends the crowd gasping with excitement.

6) 11 Premier League stars are on show - including  Seamus Coleman

The likely line-ups for both sides will see 11 Premier League stars start the match at Celtic Park. 

Everton's goal-scoring full back Coleman and exciting winger Aiden McGeady are the main attractions for Ireland and they will be up against Toffees team-mate Steven Naismith.

Scotland will also have Crystal Palace's Barry Bannan and West Bromwich Albion's James Morrison in their side.

Ireland, meanwhile, will have Stoke City's Marc Wilson, Jonathan Walters and Glenn Whelan, Sunderland's John O'Shea, as well as Hull City's David Meyler and Stephen Quinn on display.

7) Guts on show - can England say the same? No they cannot

The Irish and Scottish players will certainly not shirk a challenge as they put their bodies on the lines for their nations.

Whelan, Meyler and Celtic's Scott Brown always give everything for the cause and both sets of players will leave everything out on the pitch to ensure victory.

England, however, often lack those same guts and determination when they head out at Wembley. It will be good to see those good, old-fashioned guts on show on Friday. 

Scotland and Ireland always show passion when they play, like during this qualifier in 1987

8) One last hurrah for Robbie Keane

The former Celtic striker is already Ireland's record scorer with 65 following his hat-trick against Gibraltar last month and he will be looking for more.

At 34, Keane is still plying his trade with LA Galaxy but he will be keen to impress upon a British crowd once more.

He clearly still has his goal-scoring touch and the Scottish defence will be given a torrid night by the ex-Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool forward.

9) McGeady's back at Celtic

The flying winger spent seven years at the Hoops between 2003 and 2010 before moving to Russia with Spartak Moscow and was a particular fans' favourite.

McGeady netted 37 goals and provided 83 assists in 252 games for Celtic and dazzled the crowd while he was there.

This time in an Ireland shirt, Scotland will be hoping he does not send those fans home as happy as he once did by bagging the winner for Ireland.

10) Strachan’s got Scotland believing they can actually qualify

When was the last time Scotland genuinely believed they had a chance to qualify for a major tournament?

They have not appeared at one since the World Cup in 1998 but Strachan seems to genuinely have got the whole nation believing they can reach France 2016.

The team are vibrant, pacey and exciting on the pitch for the first time in recent memory and that has re-energised a Scottish crowd desperate to see them succeed.
