Alcoholic midwife Janice Hawke leaves Plymouth Magistrates' Court, Plymouth, Devon

A midwife was banned from the road for three years after she was caught drink-driving with a bottle of Gordon's gin, tonic water and slices of lemon in her car.

Janice Hawke, 57, was approached by a suspicious member of the public after she pulled up outside a shop to buy some alcohol last month.

Police were called and were stunned to find the bottles of gin and tonic in her car – along with a glass of neat slices of lemon.

Hawke gave an 'extremely high' breathalyser reading but later refused a blood alcohol test at a police station.

Hawke,
who was convicted of drink-driving in 2005, pleaded guilty at Plymouth 
Magistrates' Court to failing to provide a specimen.

Yesterday she was banned from driving for three years, given 12 months of community service and ordered to pay £85 in costs.

The
court heard how Hawke, who works at Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, was 
extremely distressed on the day of her arrest following the death of her
uncle who she looked after.

She drove from her home in St Budeaux, near Plymouth, to buy alcohol from a shop.

Eoin McCarthy, prosecuting, said: 'Officers noticed the inside of the vehicle smelt strongly of alcohol.

Police found a bottle of Gordon's gin, a bottle of tonic water, sliced lemon and a glass in Hawke's car

Hawke also pleaded guilty in 2005 at Plymouth Magistrates' Court to failing to provide a specimen

'On the front passenger seat was a bottle of Gordon's gin, a bottle of tonic water and a glass.

'She was clearly under the influence of alcohol and was arrested.'

Hawke could not be convicted of drink-driving as two samples are needed in a police station for a conviction.

Probation officer Charlie Casey said: 'Miss Hawke has told me that when she starts to drink she can't stop, there is no cut off period.

'She is employed as a midwife in the community and she stands to lose her employment.'
