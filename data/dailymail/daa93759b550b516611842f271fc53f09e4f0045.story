England showed real bottle and character to beat Australia. It was a high-pressure game after a patchy autumn and regaining momentum to mount a successful World Cup campaign would have been very tough if they had lost.

But win they did and now England are in pretty good shape. They all need to have a look in the mirror, though, especially the England coaches as they all seemed a little too pleased after the game - as if this was all part of some grand master plan. There is a mountain of work awaiting them. Here are the lessons England (and the other main nations) should take on board.

england have fought hard for victory but they, and the other home nations, have a lot still to learn 

CLEAR THINKING NEEDED

Stuart Lancaster has the playing talent to build a truly successful side.

England got it right at the death but for much of the autumn it was a very confused picture. George Ford or Danny Cipriani should always have started at No 10. It is clear now that Owen Farrell wasn’t match fit.

Ben Morgan should have started at No 8 from the off. Meanwhile, how can Semesa Rokoduguni go from first-choice wing against New Zealand, when he hardly touched the ball, to being out of the squad? The same applies to Kyle Eastmond. How are they feeling?

It is up to their clubs to pick up the pieces. Long-term coaching contracts hinder selection. It appears as though the pressure England were under against Australia brought clarity of thought for the first time.

FRONT FIVE SUPERSTARS

Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley, Davey Wilson, Dave Attwood and Courtney Lawes were the stand-outs, the bench forwards were strong and there are other top-class operators who will push hard for selection when they return from injury.

England’s front five can make Twickenham a horrible place for any visiting team. Can a front five win a World Cup for you? Yes, but England must use them even more effectively.

And one personal gripe. Can England stop referring to all the Lions they have to come back? It belittles the fantastic efforts of those currently wearing the England shirt.

There is no guarantee those Lions will make the team and somehow suggests the Lions ranks above England.

England's scrum was dominant and Australia simply did not know how to deal with it on Saturday

Stuart Lancaster has a front five that are simply incredible and they can dominate any side at Twickenham

GET THE BALANCE RIGHT

There is a need for lightning-quick ball from England’s back row at the breakdown.

Chris Robshaw, Ben Morgan and Tom Wood went well but there is plenty they must work on. England need more ball carrying and hard yards from them.

It was a good decision to drop Wood for Samoa, a little kick up the rear, and he responded. The combination between Wood and Morgan for the first try was nice to see, as was Morgan playing 80 minutes.

Robshaw, up against Michael Hooper, produced some key turnovers.

GET YOUR KICKS

England need to think carefully about their goal-kicking because their power up front and ability to play in the opposition half will earn plenty of penalties. And kickers invariably win World Cups. George Ford looks reliable close-in but mid-range and long-range, he does not yet have Test match consistency. He will work on that. Making a decision to play Owen Farrell at 12 offers a very strong mid-range goal-kicking option which will tip the balance his way in selection.

George Ford's kicking from short range is excellent but he struggles a bit from middle distances

Owen Farrell (right) should be considered as a No 12 for England due to his exemplary middle-range kicking

LOOK FOR DROP GOALS

A drop-goal game can be a real weapon, and not just going into the last 10 minutes of tight games. I’d like to see us dropping goals in the first minute, especially when momentum is lost in attack. There is nothing more dispiriting for a defending side, as you cannot defend against it.

With a dominant front five, how many drop goals could England deliver in one game?

I have always believed in building the score in order to get one and then two scores ahead. I believe 13 is a lucky number. If you gain a lead of 13 points, you should always win. Drop goals are a great short cut to reach that magic number.

England must look for drop goals, like Jonny Wilkinson's in 2003 World Cup final, throughout entire matches

MUST GET FITTER

England are still not fit enough. There is plenty of time to put that right, but it will require strong co-operation between the clubs and England, and I worry whether that partnership will stand the test.

There are key players who will require extra time to recover from injuries than the clubs are comfortable with and others might need a couple of weeks away from playing to do the conditioning they need.

Who at the RFU has the clout to make that happen? I am not convinced the partnership between the RFU and the clubs is as healthy as some want you to believe.

Are we going to suffer from not having central contracts?

This team must be fitter, faster and stronger to have any chance at the World Cup.

Lancaster must ensure his England side get fitter, which he has time to do, in order to compete next year

THE BIGGER PICTURE

There seems to be a lot going on off the field - a lot of media work and commercial stuff. This all makes the England camp appear very friendly and nice but it has little to do with playing great rugby and is just a general distraction.

The pressure the team came under in the last fortnight will have reminded everyone it is the rugby that matters. Very few seem interested in the culture of the team when the performance has been as lacklustre as it has been this autumn.

This is where the England players, led by Robshaw, need to stand up, take responsibility and just say a firm ‘no’.

Seeing the players being asked ‘Who in the team thinks he looks like David Beckham?’ makes me cringe. I get the feeling the players hate doing this but are not strong enough to say no. The team’s interests must come first - not fulfilling commercial objectives or creating savvy social media content.

England winning games is what everyone wants, so let’s allow the team to get on with it and reduce all this background noise.

England must look at  bigger picture and not answer questions like 'who thinks he looks like David Beckham?'

As captain, Robshaw must be strong and dictate terms, ensuring his side are not pressurised by social media

GET IN KNOCKOUT MODE

England should now approach the Six Nations as a five-game World Cup.

Their first two games should be seen as the two Pool games against Wales and Australia, which they must win to come top of the pool and have a potentially easier route to the final. Their final three games will approximate to the quarter-final, semi-final and final. Let’s get into that mindset now.

BEATABLE ALL BLACKS

New Zealand are not streets ahead of the other main nations. In some matches this year they have looked vulnerable and the gap will continue to close.

Their pack can be dominated by England and South Africa. New Zealand have never won a World Cup away from home.

England showed against the All Blacks that they are capable of beating them up front

LESS WAILING IN WALES

Don’t pay too much attention to the occasional hysteria that takes over down in Wales! Warren Gatland has won Heineken Cups, Six Nations Grand Slams and led the Lions to a series win in Australia.

He is a great coach and now Wales have a southern-hemisphere scalp, they are in very decent order. If they beat England in the Six Nations watch Wales fly.

Wales will be boosted by their victory over South Africa - celebrated here by captain Sam Warburton 

Head coach Warren Gatland is a fantastic coach and he will ensure Wales are ready for the Six Nations

NO ORDINARY JOE

In less than 18 months, Ireland under Joe Schmidt have become Six Nations champions and autumn conquerors of South Africa and Australia. Schmidt has achieved all that despite a raft of injuries and the retirement of Brian O’Driscoll. Ireland are World Cup contenders and that turnaround is down to one man.

Johnny Sexton and Ireland are going from strength to strength and will be a force come the Six Nations

Joe Schmidt has been the solitary reason behind why Ireland have progressed so impressively

THE JOY OF SIX

It is going to be one of the best Six Nations in memory. As well as England, Wales and Ireland, the Scots have upped their game. France look menacing. European rugby is flexing its muscles and three or four of our teams will have outstanding World Cups.

Scotland's Tommy Seymour scores against Australia - they are another European side on the up

16 - Tackles made by a bloodied Brad Barritt against Australia - more than anyone else. Courtney Lawes was also superb and made two try-saving efforts.
