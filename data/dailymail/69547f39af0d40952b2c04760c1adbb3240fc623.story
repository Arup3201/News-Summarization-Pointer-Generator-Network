An Albuquerque father allegedly left his 11-year-old daughter with a loaded .22 caliber gun while he went to get a tattoo.

Father John Ruiz was arrested this week shortly after a neighbor spotted his daughter with the firearm at an apartment complex swimming pool, KOB-TV reports.

Ruiz faces a child endangerment charge. 

Authorities say the girl didn't threaten anyone with the gun.

John Ruiz allegedly leaves the gun with his young daughter 'when he goes to school or runs errands for protection in case someone breaks in or something,' police said.

Ruiz has been released from jail on a $15,000 bond.

Ruiz did not say much to a KOB-TV reporter after he appeared in front of a judge.

'Liars,' he said. 'You guys don’t know anything about harassment by the neighbors or anything else.'

Ruiz did not elaborate on the 'harassment,' and told the reporter he 'did nothing wrong.'

'I made a mistake,' he said. 'That's it.'

When asked what the mistake was, Ruiz said 'That [...] I left a weapon unlocked, and my daughter - and they twisted everything around.'

A request for comment to Albuquerque police from MailOnline was not immediately returned.
