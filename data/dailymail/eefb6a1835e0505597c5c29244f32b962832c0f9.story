A schoolgirl has been found dead amid claims from her friends that she was being bullied.

Ashdon Muirhead, 14, was found  at her home in Thornton Heath, south London on Saturday after posting 'Imma miss you all' on Facebook.

Friends have since taken to the social network to claim Ashdon was bullied before her sudden death.

Darling Bless said: 'This is too sad, people need to think before they talk. You don't have to bully some physically but mentally and emotionally. Rip Ashdon.'

Mackayla Mcleod added: 'Ashdon can't believe your gone when I heard the news couldn't stop crying such a beautiful girl taken from us at such a young age but your in a better place now the people who done this to you the blood is on their hands.'

Another friend, Don Smith, commented on the post: 'Those bullies should burn in hell..'

Police say they are not treating the death of the Norbury Manor Business and Enterprise College pupil as suspicious.

They were called to Ashdon's mother's home at around 2pm on Saturday, two hours after the schoolgirl made her final post on Facebook.

According to one neighbour, Ashdon lived with her mother Patricia Muirhead at the property. 

One local said: 'I looked out of the window and could see a woman screaming and crying, then very soon afterwards an ambulance came and the police. The whole road was blocked off, they were here all afternoon.'

Ashdon's headteacher, Amanda Compton, did not comment on the bullying allegation, but said: 'The whole college are deeply saddened and shocked by the tragic news about Ashdon and we would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her family at this incredibly difficult time.'

Friends have placed flowers at the scene of Ashdon Muirhead's death after police were called on Saturday

Ms Compton added: 'She was a lively and intelligent student and both staff and students are struggling to come to terms with her loss.'

The college says it has a support plan in place and will be running special assemblies as well as offering specialist counselling support to students, staff and pupils.

Friends and well-wishers left flowers to the tragic 14-year-old outside her home today.

One bunch with a note signed 'Jade' left by the front door read: 'Ashdon will forever and always remain a place in my mind and heart.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed officers and paramedics attended the scene on Saturday.

He said: 'The deceased is a 14-year-old girl. Inquiries into the circumstances continue. At this stage the death is not being treated as suspicious.'
