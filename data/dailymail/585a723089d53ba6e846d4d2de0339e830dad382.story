Two Utah men removed from their Boy Scout leadership positions after a viral video showed them toppling an ancient rock formation pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges Tuesday and avoided jail time. Initially, the two men were charged with felonies.

Glenn Taylor, 45, and David Hall, 42, appeared in Utah's 7th District Court to enter their pleas under a deal with prosecutors. The two men from Highland were sentenced to a year of probation and ordered to pay fines and restitution, which has not yet been determined.

State prosecutors are still trying to put a price on the amount of damage caused last October to the mushroom-shaped sandstone pillar in Goblin Valley State Park, which park officials said had been standing for much of human history, if not longer. The formation was estimated to be about 170 million years old.

A video shot by Hall and posted on YouTube shows Taylor dislodging the formation at Goblin Valley State Park in central Utah that's filled with thousands of the pillars called 'hoodoos.'

Hall, Taylor and a third man were seen cheering and high-fiving after the formation toppled.

The men claimed it might have been ready to fall and kill a visitor. Both were later stripped of their Boy Scout positions.

Scott Card, an attorney for Taylor, told the Salt Lake City Tribune that the restitution will be thousands of dollars and will go toward putting up signs in the park to warn others against damaging the formations.

Both men were originally facing felony mischief charges. If Taylor and Hall meet the requirements of their probation, the offenses will later be removed from their records.

Accused: Glenn Taylor has been charged with tipping over the rock while his son and friend cheered him on

Park officials 
have said the rock formation had been standing for much of human 
history, if not longer. The central Utah park is dotted with thousands 
of the eerie, mushroom-shaped formations.

'We are taking it seriously,' Blackwell said. 'It's been an interesting case, mostly because of the attention it's garnered.'

Blackwell
 said any defense asserting the goblin-shaped rock was ready to tip over 'would need to have a lot of expert testimony, and it would probably go
 both ways.'

The round-shaped rock, which was pushed off a natural pedestal, weighed thousands of pounds, he said.

'I
 understand why the state brought felony charges - it's a definite 
deterrent effect,' Taylor's lawyer, Scott Card, said when his client initially was charged with a felony, 'but I believe it's
 an overcharge. We will be defending Mr. Taylor in court.'

The two men faced up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000.

The rock formations at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah are thousands of years old, formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock
