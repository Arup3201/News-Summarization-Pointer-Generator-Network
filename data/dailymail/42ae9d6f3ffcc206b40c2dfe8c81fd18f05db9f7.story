Horrifying The artistic director of Russia's Bolshoi ballet has described the horrific moment acid was thrown in his face when he appeared in court today.  Filin before, left,  and after the attack

In an emotional first appearance at 
the trial of three men accused over the January 17 attack, Sergei Filin 
said dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko - one of the defendants - had spread lies
about him having love affairs with ballerinas to undermine him.

He
refused to look at the courtroom cage where Dmitrichenko and the other 
defendants were sitting and said he had done nothing to deserve the 
attack, which exposed bitter rivalries at one of Russia's great 
institutions.

'I don't 
forgive anybody for what happened to me. That is very important,' Filin 
told the court after describing the late-night assault in which a masked
attacker threw acid from a jar in his face as he returned home from the
Bolshoi Theatre.

Accusations: The defendants include Pavel Dmitrichenko, a dancer at the Bolshoi Theatre, and could face up to 12 years in jail if convicted of organising and staging the attack

Dmitrichenko has denied any role in the attack and his alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, right, said he acted alone.  The third defendant, Andrei Lipatov, left, had denied accusations that he drove the assailant to and from the scene

'I 
immediately felt very strong pain. My eyes dimmed. I have never felt 
such pain in my life. I wouldn't like to speak of how I was falling, 
crawling in the dirt...'

Filin, 43, demanded moral damages of 3 million roubles ($92,200) and 508,000 roubles to compensate for material damages.

A purple scar was visible under his right cheek, and the judge said he should not be filmed or photographed.

The three defendants face up to 12 years in jail if convicted of organising and staging the attackDmitrichenko,
who made his name playing villains on the Bolshoi stage, only briefly 
looked at Filin in court and spent much of the time going through 
papers.

Career over: Sergei Filin starring in Gisellle in 2000.  It remains unclear how many of his former duties Filin will resume at the Bolshoi after his formal return to the building in Moscow's centre in September

He has denied any role in the attack. The alleged assailant, former convict Yuri Zarutsky, said he acted alone.

The third defendant, Andrei Lipatov, is accused of driving Zarutsky to and from the scene and also pleaded not guilty.

Under
Russian law, the maximum jail sentence would be reduced if the judge 
ruled the suspects were not acting as a group and found only one person 
responsible.

Filin, who had the power to make or break careers in his
role as artistic director, said Dmitrichenko was a good dancer and 
always tried to do well.

But he also said: 'Pavel did everything possible to compromise me in any possible way.'

Dmitrichenko,
29, has accused Filin of favouritism and suggested during a pre-trial 
hearing that the artistic director had had love affairs with female 
dancers.

Filin told the court the accusation was 'pure lies.'

The
case has exposed bitter rivalries behind the scenes of Russia's prime 
cultural symbol and tarnished the reputation of the world-renown 
theatre.

Filin said he 
had undergone 23 operations on his face and eyes, including in Germany, 
and more were planned with the next one, on his right eye, due later 
this month.

It remains 
unclear how many of his former duties Filin will resume at the Bolshoi 
after his formal return to the celebrated, colonnaded building in 
Moscow's centre in September.
