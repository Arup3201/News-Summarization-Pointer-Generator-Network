The father of a four-year-old boy who was knocked over and killed on Friday night has spoken of his anger at the driver who hit him and then drove away.

Reda Gendy's only son Kyrillos was hit as he waited to cross a road near a bagel shop in Staten Island, with his mother and seven-year-old sister.

Former Air Force serviceman John Sanjurjo handed himself into police 16 hours after the crash, but pleaded not guilty at his court appearance today.

'You got the wrong guy, man,' the 33-year-old said as he walked into court, where he was released on $50,000 bail.

'He could have at least waited until I 
buried my son,' Mr Gendy, said after hearing Sanjurjo had been released on bail.

'I'm going to send
him a postcard of my son every single birthday so he can know what he took from me,' Mr Gendy told ABC 7.

Sanjurjo faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident and could face seven years in prison if found guilty.

His
defense attorney Anthony Caronna has claimed that no one could identify
his client as being the driver and argued for the case to be thrown 
out.

'The people have 
nothing else but the fact that this vehicle was registered in my 
client's name. The complaint is insufficient on its face,' Mr Caronna 
told SI Live.

Mr Gendy's 34-year-old wife Arini Thomas suffered a head injury after being knocked down by the Mercedes-Benz. Their son had internal bleeding and a severe head injury.

'Had he ran to my son and held him as he took his last breath that would have meant more to me,' Mr Gendy said.

'I'm going to let him live with the fact that he took life from me,' he added, as he sobbed and beat his chest.

The
Gendys are being supported by their extended family, who have expressed
shock at the charge of leaving the scene of an accident which Sanjurjo 
faces.

'I think it's 
ridiculous that he's not being charged with manslaughter at the very 
least,' the victim's cousin, Adam Gendy, said.

'He had his whole life in front of us. I feel like he has been stolen from us,' he told NBC 4.

Mahmoud Odeh, the owner of the deli shop ran out to help the injured family.

'The mother was scared, she was holding her son,' Odeh told the New York Post. 'He was bleeding from the nose, the mouth and not moving. She was praying loudly.'

Kyrillos was taken to Staten Island University Hospital where doctors said he had severe head trauma.

They were able to revive him twice, but he eventually died in surgery because his blood pressure was too low.

'[Kyrillos was] a whole ball of fun. Full of life,' Adam told the Post. 'He had his whole life in front of him. I just don't understand what happened. I feel as though he was stolen from us.'

Police have security footage of the car entering the bagel shop's parking lot.
