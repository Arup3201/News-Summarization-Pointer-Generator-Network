It is the latest photo published by 
Pennant of the couple's exotic honeymoon on Instagram, who could be 
poised for a move abroad after the former Arsenal and Liverpool star was
 seen with his agent last month at the Al Nassr club in Dubai.

Pennant has been without a club since January following his release from Stoke City.

Pennant said: 'I'm determined to play the best football of my career over the next few years.

'I
 feel settled, happy and ready to take on a new challenge on the pitch. 
Hopefully my situation will be sorted when I get back from our 
honeymoon.'

The 31-year-old
 winger cried tears of happiness at his wedding in front of 100 guests 
at the plush Mere Golf Resort & Spa near Knutsford.

Goodwin, 28, wore a stunning £10,000 Ronald Joyce dress with a diamond tiara made of hand-cut diamonds.

After
 years of high profile relationships with actresses, models and TV 
presenters, Pennant appears to have finally found his match.

He said: 'Alice is the woman of my dreams and it was emotional to finally tie the knot with her.'

Goodwin, who is now hoping to start an acting career while continuing her modelling, said: 'It was a magical day, beautiful.

'It was great for me and Jermaine to share our special day with our family and friends.'

Pennant started his career at Notts County before joining Arsenal aged 15 for £2million.

He
 has since played for Birmingham, Liverpool, Real Zaragoza and Stoke 
before being released by the Potters in January this year by new manager
 Mark Hughes

He was arrested for drink driving in 2005 and 2012.

He famously was the first Premier League player to wear a tag during a match, for Birmingham against Tottenham in 2005.
