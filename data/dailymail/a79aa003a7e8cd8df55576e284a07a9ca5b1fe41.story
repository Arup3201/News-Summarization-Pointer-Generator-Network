Edward Brooke, the  first African-American to be popularly
elected to the U.S. Senate, has died.  

Brooke, 95, was elected to Congress in 1966 by Republican voters in
Massachusetts at a time when the nation was gripped by racial
unrest. 

There had been two black senators shortly after the Civil War
but they were picked by
state legislatures and not by popular vote - a system which prevailed until the early 20th century.

Edward Brooke, the MassachusettsRepublican who was the first African-American to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, died on Saturday

Brooke was one of just  nine black people who have ever served in that branch - including Barack Obama.

On Saturday, he died of natural causes at home in Coral Gables, Florida, surrounded by his family. 

A revered politician known for his honesty, Brooke triumphed as a Republican in a typically Democrat state. 

He was serving as the Massachusetts attorney general when hewas elected to the U.S. Senate, where he spent 12 years. 

Among his notable actions, Brooke was the first Republican senator to publicly urge President Nixon to resign. 

After Obama's election, Brooke said he was 'thankful to God' that he had lived to see the historical milestone. 

Months later, the president was on stage to see Brooke receive the Congressional Gold Medal - the highest award Congress has to honor civilians.  

Tributes have flooded in from all corners of the political world.

Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recalled his first impression of the newly elected senator when McConnell was a Senate staffer and described Brooke as 'a model of courage and honesty in office.'

'... even from across the Senate chamber, you could sense that this was a Senator of historic importance,' the Kentucky Republican said in a statement Saturday. 'Indeed, he was.'

Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, the state's first black governor, remembered Brooke for his unselfish public service.

'He carried the added honor and burden of being 'the first' and did so with distinction and grace,' Patrick said. 'I have lost a friend and mentor. America has lost a superb example of selfless service.'

He earned a name for himself by creating the Brooke amendment: the federal housing act, passed in 1969, which limited to 25 percent the amount of income a family must pay for rent in public housing.

However, late in his second term, Brooke divorced his wife of 31 years, Remigia, in a stormy proceeding that attracted national attention.

Repercussions from the case spurred an investigation into his personal finances by the Senate Ethics Committee and a probe by the state welfare department and ultimately cost him the 1978 election. He was defeated by Democrat Rep. Paul E. Tsongas.

Tsongas' widow, U.S. Rep. Nikki Tsongas, said Saturday that Brooke's career was 'as courageous as it was historic.'

In a Boston Globe interview in 2000, Brooke recalled the pain of losing his bid for a third term.

'It was just a divorce case. It was never about my work in the Senate. There was never a charge that I committed a crime, or even nearly committed a crime,' Brooke said.

In 2008, pioneering newswoman Barbara Walters said she had an affair with the then-married Brooke in the 1970s, but it ended before he lost the 1978 election. She called him 'exciting' and 'brilliant.'

Brooke received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a White House ceremony in 2004. Five years later, Brooke received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress has to honor civilians. He cited then the issues facing Congress - health care, the economy and the wars overseas - and called on lawmakers to put their partisan differences aside.

'We've got to get together,' Brooke said, turning his eyes to Senate GOP Leader McConnell. 'We have no alternative. There's nothing left. It's time for politics to be put aside on the back burner.'

As Brooke sought the Senate seat in 1966, profiles in the national media reminded readers that he had won office handily in a state where blacks made up just 2 percent of the population - the state that had also given the nation its only Roman Catholic president, John F. Kennedy.

He beat Democrat Endicott Peabody, a former governor who also supported civil rights, by a 3-to-2 margin despite predictions of a 'white backlash' against him.

Commenting on Brooke's election and other developments that day, Martin Luther King Jr. said that 'despite appeals to bigotry of an intensity and vulgarity never before witnessed in the North, millions of white voters remained unshaken in their commitment to decency.'

Brooke had parlayed his probes of local corruption into a successful run for state attorney general in 1962 when he became the highest ranking black elected official in the nation. He won re-election as attorney general in 1964 even though Democrats dominated other races.

Somewhat aloof from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, especially the militant wing, he said blacks had to win allies, not fight adversaries. But he also said of civil rights leaders: 'Thank God we have them. But everyone has to do it in the best way he can.'

He had refused to endorse Sen. Barry Goldwater for president in 1964, commenting later, 'You can't say the Negro left the Republican Party; the Negro feels he was evicted from the Republican Party.'

The son of a Veterans Administration lawyer, Brooke was raised in a middle-class black section of Washington, attending segregated schools through his graduation from Howard University in 1941. He served in an all-black combat unit in World War II, and later settled in Boston after graduating from Boston University Law School.

Brooke was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 and went public the following year, saying he wanted to encourage men to perform self-examinations and advocating that insurance companies cover male mammograms.

Brooke is survived by his second wife, Anne Fleming Brooke; their son Edward Brooke IV; his daughters from his first marriage, Remi Goldstone and Edwina Petit; stepdaughter Melanie Laflamme, and four grandchildren.
