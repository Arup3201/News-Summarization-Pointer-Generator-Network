This South African daredevil duo showed off some serious stunts earlier this month.

Thankfully, Leander, one of the country's leading base jumpers, and Sylvain, an experienced slackliner, were filmed by an onlooker - and willing participant - called James.

After videographer James attempted the rope swing into a base jump trick, he decided to document Leander and Sylvain's impressive project.

Hold on! Professional base jumper Leander takes his position for a swing rope into base jump maneuver

Once he reaches the far side of the swing, Leander lets go and dispatches his parachute 

'They were very friendly and immediately told me that I had to do the swing as well, which I did,' James says. 'I can without a doubt say that it was the scariest thing I have ever done.

'I subsequently asked them if I could make a short movie of what they were doing for them and 'Let Go' is the result.'

In the video, Leander explains just how much work goes into ensuring that a stunt of such stunning magnitude goes off without a hitch, before fastening the Go Pro camera to himself and plunging down toward the ocean below.

An experienced rigger, Leander's fellow daredevil Sylvain also makes sure to take a turn on the swing rope

No fear here! Sylvain happily soars above the ocean, swinging back toward the cliffside

'We did some test jumps to make sure it can hold on and everyone's held on, so it's all good. But the problem is, if you don't swing through the whole swing and let go at the bottom, you've above about 70 m of vertical, which is too low to base jump.

'You'd make it, but it would be very nasty. If you hold on all the way  to the end, you're like 150 m [above the ground], so that's safe. As long as you don't slip off, you're good.'

After Leander demonstrates his skill, swinging out over the ocean, before parachuting the rest of the way down the cliffside, his friend Sylvain takes on a breathtaking slackline walk.

Next up? Sylvain, a trained stunt professional and slackliner, will take a walk high in the sky

Though he shakes at times, Sylvain keeps calm and cool and maintains balance

Upon completing his tricky walk in the sky, Sylvain turns to his friends to proclaim: 'Project done!'

Sylvain, a master rigger, does mostly stunt-orientated work for the movie industry, and also has a company that specialises in manufacturing climbing and slacklining gear.

'Generally, on a high line, you would walk toward a cliff face or slackline towards a tree,' Sylvain explains after completing his sky-high walk. 'But this, your fixed point is the horizon.'

Although it took several days to set up and test the length and strength of the ropes and lines, both men told James that it was 'very unlikely that they would ever rig it back up again.'

Talk about a true once-in-a-lifetime experience!
