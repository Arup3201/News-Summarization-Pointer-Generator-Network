Team news

Aston Villa

Libor Kozak has suffered a setback as he returns for a broken leg and is expected to be missing for a number of weeks after an operation.

But Christian Benteke could return for Aston Villa against Manchester City after his recovery from a ruptured Achilles.

The striker has been out since April but played over an hour, and scored a penalty, in the under-21s' 3-0 win over Bolton on Monday but captain Ron Vlaar is still sidelined with a calf injury.

Provisional squad: Guzan, Given, Hutton, Lowton, Senderos, Baker, Okore, Clark, Cissokho, Delph, Bacuna, Westwood, Cole, Richardson, Grealish, Sanchez, N'Zogbia, Cleverley, Weimann, Bent, Benteke, Agbonlahor.

Manchester City

Manchester City midfielder Fernando is back in contention for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Aston Villa.

The Brazilian, who made a positive immediate impact after his summer move from Porto, has missed the last six games with a groin injury.

His return leaves playmaker Samir Nasri, who recently underwent groin surgery, as manager Manuel Pellegrini's only major absentee.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Mangala, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Silva, Navas, Milner, Lampard, Toure, Fernando, Fernandinho, Aguero, Jovetic, Dzeko.
