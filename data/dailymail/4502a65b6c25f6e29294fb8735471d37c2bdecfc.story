The Duchess of Cambridge’s uncle was accused of ‘betrayal’ last night after revealing intimate details about Kate’s personal life, her romance with Prince William and their holidays at his Spanish villa.

Gary Goldsmith, 47, cashed in on his royal connections by giving a major interview to Hello! magazine about ‘The Kate I Know’ and the early days of her relationship with William.

The Hello! deal was negotiated by Goldsmith’s agent and both the interview and photoshoot took place at his Ibiza villa,which is on the market for £6million.

Revealing all: Kate's Uncle, Gary Goldsmith, has spoken to Hello! magazine about his family

Goldsmith also paints a picture of a lovelorn Kate pacing around the pool during her brief break-up with William.

This is the first time a close member of the Middleton family has spoken in such detail about our future queen.

Interview: It is not known how much Mr Goldsmith was paid to speak to Hello! magazine

Over 16 pages, he tells how the young 
couple enjoyed mud baths on the island, William’s stint DJing for the 
family and how Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, told him not to worry 
about the bad publicity he had attracted for the family before the royal
 wedding.

In an embarrassing breach of protocol,
 the interview also reveals how Kate and William  shared a room seven 
years ago during a break at the villa, dubiously named La Maison de Bang
 Bang.

The tattooed tycoon, Carole 
Middleton’s brother, is understood to have been paid for the interview, 
although neither the magazine nor his agent would discuss whether or how
 much Goldsmith was paid.

There is no doubt, however, that the publicity will be invaluable in increasing the profile of the villa he is trying to sell.

The pictures show several rooms in the
 house –  plus shots of Goldsmith reclining on a bed with family album 
snaps, some of which are reproduced with the article. Another shows him 
on a gold ‘throne’ beside his 11-year-old daughter Tallulah.

He also confirms he is planning a book  about ‘his experiences at the heart of the Middleton clan’.

Goldsmith, once caught on camera 
snorting cocaine and advising an undercover reporter how to meet 
Brazilian prostitutes, also tells the magazine of a private conversation
 he had with the Duchess of Cornwall at the royal wedding reception in 
Buckingham Palace.

He apologised to Camilla for the ‘bad 
press’ he created and said  she told him: ‘Don’t think twice about it.’ 

Last night royal commentators accused Goldsmith of ‘betrayal’ and 
‘capitalising on family relationships’. 

Former Buckingham Palace 
spokesman Dickie Arbiter told the Mail: ‘He has sold the family out. He 
added: ‘He’s cooked his goose on this one.’

Majesty magazine editor-in-chief 
Ingrid Seward said: ‘He either doesn’t care or the enormity of his niece
 and sister’s position has passed him by.’ 

‘Uncle G’, as the Middleton 
siblings apparently describe him, is said to have given the interview 
‘to set the record straight’ after adverse publicity in the run-up to 
the royal wedding in 2011 about his ‘wayward’ activities.

Recently it emerged he was living with
 a convicted fraudster who once made off with £250,000.

Julie-Ann Brown,
 whom he married last year, shared his £1.5million mews house in London 
after being spared jail by a judge.

It is unclear if Kate’s mother Carole 
Middleton and her father Michael were fully aware of the article before 
it was published but they clearly did not stop it.

Goldsmith even gives a plug to their 
Party Pieces company, and claims credit for the idea that the business 
should expand online.

Perhaps significantly he adds: ‘I love all things 
marketing and how to present a brand.’

Goldsmith’s agent described as 
‘nonsense’ any suggestion he was effectively using pictures and detail 
about Kate and Bang Bang to help sell the villa.

Asked if the Duchess had been aware of
 the interview or was consulted, a St James’s Palace spokesman said: ‘We
 are not commenting on the grounds that we wouldn’t comment on private 
conversations between members of the Middleton family.’
