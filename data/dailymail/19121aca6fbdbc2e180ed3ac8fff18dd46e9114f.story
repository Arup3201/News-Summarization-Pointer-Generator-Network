A group of Aboriginal protesters hit the headlines again today after they  set fire to the Australian flag outside the country's Parliament in Canberra.

A video captured showed protesters outside Parliament setting light to the flag and spitting on it while chanting, 'Always was, 
always will be Aboriginal land.'

The protest came a day after riot police were called to form a human shield around Prime Minister Julia Gillard and escort her out of a Canberra restaurant after hundreds of angry protesters surrounded the building.

Day out: Australian PM Julia Gillard seems unruffled by yesterday's events and was pictured enjoying the men's semifinal match between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic at the 2012 Australian Open at Melbourne Park today

The fall out continued today with authorities and indigenous-rights 
protesters blamed each other today for the heated clash.

Ms
Gillard stumbled in yesterday's fray and lost a shoe, which protesters 
scooped up after the rowdy demonstration in the capital Canberra.

Aboriginal-rights
supporters had surrounded a restaurant and banged on its windows while 
Ms Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbott were inside at an award 
ceremony to mark Australia Day.

Ms Gillard said today that she was fine, but slammed the activists' actions which disrupted an event 'which was to honour some extraordinary Australians'

A 
shoe advertised as the one Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard lost 
when she was bundled to a car by her bodyguards has been pulled off eBay and handed to a security guard at Parliament House by a member of the Aboriginal tent embassy.

The navy-blue suede wedge shoe came off Gillard's foot on Thursday in Canberra as she fled angry Aboriginal rights protesters.

The online auction website posted a listing for what was purportedly the missing shoe with a starting price of Aus $148 (£100).

'Please bear in mind also this is a 
single shoe, not a pair, so it would be difficult to walk in, unless 
you're the PM,' the listing stated, according to the Sydney Morning 
Herald.

eBay took it down 
amid concern it was a hoax and because sellers can only list items they 
own or the owner has given permission to sell.

Ms
Gillard did not seem to care. 'It really doesn't worry me,' she said 
with a grin. 'I'm in a fortunate situation where I'm a woman with a few 
pairs of shoes.

However, in an embarrassment for the Prime Minister, Tony Hodges, one of
her media advisers was forced to resign today after it emerged he had 
tipped off a someone about Mr Abbott's presence and comments at the function 
and that person had then informed the protesters.

Ms Gillard's spokesman 
said the staff member had not encouraged violence but the tip-off was 'an error of judgment.'

Michael Outram, national manager of 
protection for the Australian Federal Police, said police may file 
charges against some of the protesters. Ms Gillard said today that she 
was fine, but slammed the activists' actions.

'I've
got no troubles at all with peaceful protests. ... What I utterly 
condemn is when protests turn violent the way we saw the violence 
yesterday, and particularly to disrupt an event which was to honour some
extraordinary Australians,' she said.

Protest leaders denied doing anything 
wrong, accused the police of manhandling protesters and said they 
planned to lodge a complaint against the officers involved.

'The Australian Federal Police came 
at us with force and we did not retaliate with force,' protest 
spokeswoman Selina Daveys-Newry told reporters today. 'We see straight 
through that little puppet play.'

Today's
protest showed involved about 200 indigenous-rights supporters marched 
on the nation's Parliament House today, burning an Australian flag in 
front of a wall of police and carrying signs with messages such as 'All 
cops are bastards'.

No one was hurt and the protesters left minutes later.

The
restaurant where yesterday's clash occurred is close to the so-called 
Aboriginal Tent Embassy, where the protesters had demonstrated 
peacefully earlier in the day.

Australia Day Protests: Authorities and indigenous-rights protesters blamed each other today for the heated clash

All in the line of duty: A minder hauls Gillard from the danger zone of Aboriginal protesters

Condemn: Warren Mundine, a respected Aboriginal leader, denounced the actions of the protesters, saying 'If you look at (Abbott's) words, they're pretty harmless and they don't even mention anything about moving the Tent Embassy'

That long-standing, ramshackle 
collection of tents and temporary shelters is a centre point of protests
against Australia Day, which marks the arrival of the first fleet of 
British colonists in Sydney on January 26, 1788.

Many Aborigines call it Invasion Day because the land was settled without a treaty with traditional owners.

Mr
Outram defended the way yesterday's incident had been handled, saying 
police had no idea the protest - which had been peaceful for much of the
day - would turn aggressive.

'We had no information or reason to suspect there was going to be any problem,' Mr Outram told reporters in Canberra.

The protests appear to have been 
aimed primarily at opposition leader Tony Abbott, who was also in the 
building when some 200 demonstrators began banging on its windows, 
shouting 'shame' and 'racist'.

Mr Abbott had angered activists 
earlier in the day by saying it was time the nearby Aboriginal Tent 
Embassy, which celebrated its 40th anniversary yesterday,  'moved on'.

Mr Abbott said today that his comment had been misinterpreted, and that he never meant to imply the embassy should be torn down.

Warren Mundine, a respected Aboriginal leader, denounced the actions of the protesters, saying they had overreacted.

'They
are a fringe, radical group - they're not the mainstream of indigenous 
Australians,' Mr Mundine said. 'If you look at (Abbott's) words, they're
pretty harmless and they don't even mention anything about moving the 
Tent Embassy.'
