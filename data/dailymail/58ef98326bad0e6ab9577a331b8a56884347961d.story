A father of three has been charged with murder after allegedly killing his wife and their seven-year-old son at their home and then turning himself into police.

Krista Stone, 32, and Zachery Stone were found dead in their one-storey brick house in Southeast Huntsville, Alabama by Huntsville police at 10.30 a.m. on Sunday.

The officers had been asked to carry out a welfare check on the home by Leeds police after Stephen Marc Stone, 33, turned himself into officers that morning, a spokesperson said.

Stone, who also has two younger 
daughters, was later transferred to Huntsville, where he was 
charged with two counts of capital murder.

Sgt. Jerry King declined to give details about how the mother and her young son were killed as family members are still being notified of the deaths.

Police said they are still searching for a motive and the investigation is ongoing.

AL.com reported that police officers checked on the home on Sunday morning and confirmed it was the scene of a homicide.

Several hours later, they were granted a search warrant and could conduct a full investigation.

King said the investigation moved slowly as it is a 'delicate' situation with the family, AL.com reported.

The county coroner arrived at the scene at 4.30 p.m. and left with body bags a short time later.

A neighbour told the news site that the parents worked at Crestwood Hospital and had two other children, aged around one and four years old.

The couple's Facebook pages show a seemingly happy life with day trips with the three children - a boy and two blonde girls - as well as birthday parties and photos with extended family members.

The neighbour added that the family had lived at the one-storey house for around a year.

The two other children are now in the care of their grandparents, police said.

Stone is being held without bond.
