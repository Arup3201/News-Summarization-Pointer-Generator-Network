Vinyl is seen as an outdated medium by some.

But many music fans covet the pure sound of records, pushing up the price of the rarest gems.

Old favourites The Beatles and Sex Pistols dominate the new top-10 list of the most expensive records, taking up nine places in the top 10 countdown.

Only Queen break up their stranglehold with a rare version of Bohemian Rhapsody, coming in at number eight in the list compiled by Record Collector magazine.

All you need is love: The Beatles dominate the top-10 in three positions, with two songs by their earlier band The Quarry Men also appearing. Top, Ringo Starr, left, and Paul McCartney and bottom, George Harrison, left, and John Lennon

Topping the list for a second year is a unique acetate copy of That'll Be The Day/In Spite Of All The Danger by The Quarry Men - a pre-Beatles group featuring John Lennon, Sir Paul McCartney and George Harrison.

Their 1958 demo recording is valued at 
£200,000, while at number two is a 1981 reproduction of the single - on 
seven-inch and 10-inch vinyl - which goes for a more modest £10,000.

He has no regrets about not making the transition from John Lennon and Paul McCartney's first band to The Beatles - but John Duff Lowe, who later became a stockbroker, might rue one missed opportunity.

A vinyl record that Mr Lowe, from Yatton, Somerset, kept at the bottom of a drawer in his home for more than 20 years is today named as the most valuable in the world by industry bible Record Collector.

Mr Lowe - known simply as Duff - played piano for The Quarry Men, the forerunners of The Beatles, and had kept the first record cut by Lennon and McCartney, which is valued at £200,000.

Duff absentmindedly put the original acetate disc, recorded in a Liverpool studio in 1958, in the bottom of a drawer and forgot about it until the early 1980s, when he sold it back to McCartney for an undisclosed sum.

The recording later appeared in the Beatles' Anthology series, which was released in the 1990s.

McCartney later recalled: 'We shared the record. I kept it for a week, George kept it for a week, John kept it for a week, [drummer] Colin Hanton kept it for a week, then Duff kept it for 23 years.'

The magazine, which publishes its list 
today, places the Pistols' God Save The Queen/No Feelings at number 
three. A rare acetate version would fetch roughly £10,000.

Originally released in 1977, prices appear to have shot up around 60 per cent as the Queen celebrates her Diamond Jubilee year, with one copy fetching £12,630 in recent months.

The tracks were pressed to help manager Malcolm McLaren secure a new deal for the group after they were axed by EMI.

Another version of the same record, when the group were briefly on A&M Records, is valued at £8,000. Although 20,000 copies were made, most were destroyed, making it a collector's item.

The punk idols are also at number five with the acetate copy of Anarchy In The UK, with No Fun on the B-side, its price estimated at £7,000. Only three copies are known to exist.

The Quarry Men recording at the top of the list was created in July 1958 by the Beatles trio plus John 'Duff' Lowe on piano and drummer Colin Hanlon, who headed into a studio after shelling out a few shillings.

The acetate version ended up in Lowe's hands and he eventually sold it to Sir Paul, who is still thought to own it. He had it restored and it was used to make the handful of 1981 copies.

The lower reaches of the top 200 in the magazine show growing prices for UK heavy metal acts such as Iron Maiden, at 189 with a rare brown vinyl 12-inch version of Twilight Zone going for £800, and Holocaust's Slay That Dragon at 191, valued at a similar amount.

Ian Shirley, editor of the Rare Record 
Price Guide who compiled the list for Record Collector, said: 'When it 
comes to collectable rare vinyl, the Beatles remain the blue chip 
investment, and no doubt the recent 50th anniversary of the release of 
their debut single Love Me Do has helped focus collectors' minds on the 
longevity and power of their music as well as inflate prices for mint 
copies of their albums, singles and EPs.

'The appeal of Fab Four collectables is worldwide. I was in Japan last week and when I asked the head buyer of one of the biggest dealing shops in the country what artist or genre was the most collectable in Japan, although he did not speak any English, he had one word for me, "Beatles".

'The Quarry Men acetate is now, in musical terms, a holy tablet equivalent to the Ten Commandments that Moses brought down from the mount.

'It is ironic that, despite the fact that back in the 70s the Sex Pistols were the epitome of anti-establishment attitude, today they are one of the most collectable bands in the world with mint copies of rarities being seen as a safe blue chip investment. The Queen's Diamond Jubilee not only crowned her longevity as a ruler but also their own as the top collectable punk band in the world.'

Mr Shirley said little-known bands who made little impact or money in their careers can now command huge prices.

'There is a real hunger for mint copies of collectable late 60s and early 70s LPs, with obscure acts like Leafhound, Pussy, Grannie, July and Red Dirt, to name a few - whose records only sold a few hundred copies at the time - now fetching four-figure sums.'
