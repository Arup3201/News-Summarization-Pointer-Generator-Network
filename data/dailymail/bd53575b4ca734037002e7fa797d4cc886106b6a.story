The idea of setting up a dance class for dogs came to her in a 'strong dream' and she has run with it.

Dog behavioural expert Faith Wild, who has worked with disobedient pooches for over 20 years, doesn’t use the normal training tools such as food treats  - instead she’s adopted the two-step, a stereo and a dose of David Bowie.

The canine therapist, from the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, is set to launch a $175 6-week course for naughty dogs after practicing routines on her own pets at home.

Faith Hill is the dancing dog trainer, she rescues dogs and retrains them using a musical method. She is pictured here practicing some moves with her greyhound Lolly

Her three-year-old Greyhound Lolly loves to dance to Bowie, while her new small rescue Maltese cross, Moses, prefers an Irish jig.

'We go for a walk with music around the room and see what they like. Dogs actually like music. My dogs like Bowie, Let's Dance, probably because I like it too,' she laughed.

Ms Wild, who is a member of Bark Busters Home Dog Training, calls the new classes 'obedience with a twist'.

Talking about her idea to start up doggy dance classes, she told MailOnline: 'I dreamt it. I had a really strong dream, I just woke up.

'I used to do obedience classes but they were big and cumbersome and you can't give individual attention.'

Faith currently has nine dogs in her care and says they respond positively to being trained through dance

She said when she turns the stereo on and the volume up the dogs go 'yeehah!' and 'immediately jump into it'.

'The hardest bit is containing their excitement,' she explained.

'It's a set routine and it's set to certain music depending on the dogs. We have to get the right beat for the right dogs.'

For anyone worried that dogs aren't cut out for dancing, Ms Wild reassured: 'We aren't getting them to leap in the air or anything like that. They are doing synchronised dances with their owner.'

Ms Wild has tried and tested the class on her own dogs and boasted that they are 'really good'.

'They absolutely love it', she said.

Dancefloor etiquette will not be overlooked during the classes, the dogs will be taught at bow at the end of the lesson before they resume their normal lives.

The main objective of the class is for them to keep in time with their owners. And after the dogs have pranced around Cooroy Anglican Church Hall in synchronised routines with their owners there will be a 15 minute discussion.

‘I teach people to connect with their dog… the by product is you get a really well behaved dog.’

The aim of Ms Hill's classes is to teach the dogs to do a synchronised routine with their owners, teaching them to be in sync with one another

The hardest part of running a dance class for dogs is that the animals get too excited when the music starts
