Five former patients of Desmond D'Mello have tested positive for hepatitis C after claims he ignored infection control rules

Five former patients of a dentist accused of putting lives at risk amid claims he flouted infection control rules, have tested positive for hepatitis C.

Desmond D'Mello's alleged refusal to follow NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days. 

NHS England alerted 22,000 patients after fears they could have been exposed to blood-borne diseases including HIV and hepatitis while being treated at the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham.

A total of 4,526 patients were tested and five were diagnosed with hepatitis C as a result, health bosses confirmed.

No cases of hepatitis B or HIV were found.  

The recall was issued in November,  and an investigation into apparent breaches of infection control procedures by Mr D'Mello was launched.

The dentist, who ran his practice for 32 years, was suspended. 

Dr Doug Black, Medical Director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'We have always been clear that the risk to patients was low, but we still had a duty to inform patients of this and offer the option for them to be tested.

'Treatments are available for all of the blood-borne viruses tested for, so we are pleased that these individuals have been identified and offered clinical support to aid their well-being.

'Now that this patient screening exercise is complete, we will be focusing our efforts on what we can learn from this incident and ensuring all our findings are shared with the General Dental Council to inform their ongoing investigation into Mr D'Mello.'

Mr D'Mello is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission and the General Dental Council after he was secretly filmed by a whistleblower failing to change his medical gloves between patients or properly sterilise equipment.

The dentist went to ground after his work was called into question and has never spoken publicly about the allegations.

Dr Vanessa MacGregor, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, East Midlands said: 'With such a high number of people being tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, the small number of positives that have been picked up as a result of screening is in line with what we would expect to see due to the very low prevalence of these blood-borne viruses within the community.

'Effective treatments are available for all blood-borne viruses, which is why it is important to identify anyone who may have been at risk of infection, so treatment can be started if necessary.'

Mr D'Mello, who ran the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham, which has now changed name and is under new ownership, sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days amid allegations he failed to follow NHS safety procedures

Patients who tested positive were informed by their GPs and referred for further clinical advice and testing.

Since August 2014 the former Daybrook Dental Practice has been under new ownership by Southern Dental, which is not in connected to this incident.

A spokesman for NHS England said any former patients of Mr D'Mello who have not yet accessed testing and wish to do so should contact their GP.

Many of his former patients are taking legal action against the dentist.

Around 200 are building cases with legal firm the Dental Law Partnership.

David Corless-Smith, a solicitor with the company, said last week: 'Desmond D'Mello was a master of five-minute dentistry and you can't do much that is going to last a long time in five minutes.

'We have 200 of Mr D'Mello's former patients bringing claims for nervous shock of being told they may have contracted a life-threatening infection but half of those are pursuing claims for poor treatment.'
