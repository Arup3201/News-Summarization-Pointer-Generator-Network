Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao insists he still wants to stay at Old Trafford next season despite his early difficulties at the club.

The Colombia centre forward has only started three Barclays Premier League games – and none for more than two months – after suffering injuries in the wake of his big-money loan transfer from Monaco on transfer deadline day.

Falcao is fit now but has found himself behind Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and even young James Wilson in the pecking order with United manager Louis van Gaal telling the 28-year-old he won't pick him on reputation alone.

But Falcao insists he still wants a permanent deal at United after his £250,000-a-week loan arrangement expires at the end of the season.

'We talk a lot, the coach and I,' revealed Falcao. 'He has a philosophy that I respect.

'I have had an injury, and I have had to wait for the opportunity to play.

'From my point of view, yes I want to stay.

'Obviously I have to analyse the situation, see if I play more and see what decision the board takes.

'But from my point of view, I really want to stay.'

Falcao has only scored one United goal so far - in the 2-1 win against Everton in October - but did return as a substitute against Liverpool at the weekend.

The only goal Falcao has scored since joining the Red Devils came against Everton in October

The striker has been recovering from a long-term knee injury and also picked up a thigh problem

Having arrived with a knee injury, Falcao has gone on to suffer muscle problems in his thigh. But the South American claims he is now ready to show the United support what he is really capable of.

'It felt good to play,' he added. 'Physically I felt good.

'I am very happy because of the run that we are on. I am not playing many minutes but I am sure that there will more opportunities to play

'I feel ready for the moment that the team needs me. Whenever I have the opportunity to come on I try to do my best for the coach and I try to help the team.

'I'm almost at 100 per cent now so let's wait and see what the decision of the coach is, when he wants to use me more.

'We have a group of strikers who are very good and that's good for everyone.

VIDEO Falcao wants to play

Falcao joined United on deadline day in August on a mega-money loan move from  Monaco

The forward has been a prolific scorer for Colombia and at several European clubs, but not yet United

'That means there is always a level of competition between us, healthy competition, and obviously I am very happy with how the team is doing.

'Every footballer wants to play, no-one is happy when they are not playing, when they are on the bench.

'But whenever I am given the opportunity, whether it be for five, 10, 20 or 90 minutes, I have to give my best.

'But it's all good here. I am very happy in this city, in this club and I am enjoying it here.'
