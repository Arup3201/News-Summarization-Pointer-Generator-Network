Dark horses Belgium are in confident mood heading into the World Cup as they take time out from training to get a group photo.

Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini, La Liga champion Thibaut Courtois and their Belgian team-mates struck a pose for fans as they trained in Brussels.

The players were in positive spirits despite having their 5-1 victory over Luxembourg last weekend wiped from the record books due to coach Marc Wilmots making too many substitutions.

Double debutant: Adnan Januzaj had his debut against Luxembourg expunged from history

As a result, United youngster Adnan Januzaj and back-up goalkeeper Sammy Bossut are yet to officially make their debuts for the national side.

Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku's hat-trick will also expunged from official records.

But, having moved up one place to 11th in FIFA's latest world rankings, Belgium travel to South America with the belief they can go far in the tournament.

They will be confident of progressing out of Group H, which also contains Algeria, Russia and South Korea.

Belgium face Tunisia on Saturday in their final warm-up match before they head to Brazil.
