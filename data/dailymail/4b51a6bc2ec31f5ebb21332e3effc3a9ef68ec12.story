For hotel cities looking to expand, space is always a problem.

However, one resort in Austria got around that issue but lifting its new penthouse onto its roof with a crane.

The LoftCube room, which weighs 12 tonnes, sits 65ft in the air on top of Hotel Daniel, in the southern city of Graz.   

Up and away! The 12-tonne all-glass cube suite was lifted onto the roof of the hotel with a crane 

High life: At the Hotel Daniel in Graz, Austria, the top floor has been given a radical makeover in the form of a new suite

Boasting glass walls on every side, the 44-square metre room - which costs £300 a night - has also been placed on stilts to add a feeling of 'floating in air' to those renting it.

And it affords guests stunning 360-degree views across Arnold Schwarzenegger's hometown in Styria, a province in the south of the country - including of the city's Unesco heritage sites Schlossberg and Schloss Eggenberg.

The cube accommodation was winched into place using a massive crane capable of lifting it more than 65ft to get it onto the roof.

To reach the roof, the cube suite had to be lifted over 20 metres into the air by a crane

The luxurious suite also boasts a specially-made bed, designer furniture, and a home cinema

It meant that, during construction, the hotel operators did not need to close for disruptions.

Conceputalised by Berlin-based architect and designer Werner Aisslinger, the room also features a specially made extra-large double bed, designer furniture, a rainfall shower fitted with plants to simulate a jungle, a home cinema, and, of course, blinds for extra privacy.

The LoftCube is now available for bookings. 

The £300 per night room offers visitors unparalleled views of the city's Unesco heritage sites 

On its website, Hotel Daniel writes: 'A habitable glass cube at lofty heights. With a luxurious interior virtually touching the stars.

'Somehow it all sounds a little like science fiction. But it’s true. And it’s in Graz. Right on the Hotel Daniel roof.

'44 unique square metres conceived by Berlin designer Werner Aisslinger and featuring all-round panoramic views: that’s the LoftCube.

The cube joins the other 107 rooms at the design hotel, which reopened in 2005.
