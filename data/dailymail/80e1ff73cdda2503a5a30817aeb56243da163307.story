They are both titans at the BBC but are on a collision course over one’s treatment of the English language.

On air yesterday, John Humphrys chastised fellow Radio 4 grandee Lord Bragg for speaking about historic events in the present tense.

The Today presenter, famed for his tough questioning, declared it was ‘confusing, bogus, irritating and pretentious’.

War of words: John Humphrys has thrown down the gauntlet to fellow broadcaster Melvyn Bragg over his use of English

He threw down the gauntlet to Lord Bragg, 74, over his weekly history show In Our Time, insisting: ‘This is important, this is a battle…the war is going to be about stuff like this.’

Both broadcasting veterans pride themselves on being sticklers for accuracy and both have written books on the English language.

Humphrys said Lord Bragg's use of the present tense was 'faddish, confusing and very BBC'

But Humphrys, 70, mocked the peer’s style on Sunday’s Radio 4 show Broadcasting House. In a parody of an introduction to In Our Time, he said: ‘The young Charles Darwin is developing severe doubts about biblical literalism, but he doesn’t want to upset the Church; meanwhile his daughter develops a boil on her bottom (or whatever): how does he feel about this?’

Humphrys was prompted to go public after columnist Matthew Parris raised the issue in The Times last week.

He wrote: ‘In English usage, there’s a slide towards employing the present tense to describe the historic past. On In Our Time they do it all the time.

‘I hate the fashion, thought so cutting edge and cool. Academics are doing it all the time, injecting a bogus sense of immediacy into discussion. It’s faddish, confusing and very BBC.’

Humphrys, who also hosts BBC2’s Mastermind, said: ‘Melvyn [Bragg] is a giant, a titan of broadcasting as we all know. I wouldn’t have gone public with it if it hadn’t been for Matthew [Parris].

‘But it is confusing, I believe. It gives a bogus, an entirely bogus, sense of immediacy. It is irritating, it is pretentious.’

He complained that the habit was pervading news bulletins and other programmes too.

But Humphrys admitted: ‘With a bit of luck, Melvyn will be on holidays and he won’t have heard this, because I fear the confrontation.’

Humphrys, who began at the BBC in 1966, has signed a contract to stay there. There was no response from Lord Bragg yesterday.
