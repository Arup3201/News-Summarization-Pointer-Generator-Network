Caught: Nearly four years after three family members were found murdered with a pick axe, State Police have arrested Nicholas Ortiz, 20, the man suspected of the triple homicide

A man from New Mexico suspected of killing a couple and their adult son nearly four years ago has been taken into custody and charged with three counts of murder.

Nicholas Ortiz, 20, was also charged with tampering with evidence and bribery or intimidation of a witness. 

Ortiz  tried to steal $20,000 from the family who had previously let him stay in their home, according to court documents.

State police say 53-year-old Dixie Ortiz, 55-year-old Lloyd Ortiz and their special-needs son, 21-year-old Steven Ortiz, were found dead from head trauma in their El Rancho home on June 29, 2011.

Investigators later found a blood-stained pick ax in a nearby field and linked the weapon to the killings.

The grisly murders had lingered among the state's most disturbing unsolved cases and had left a sense of unease in the community where the slain Ortiz family members were well regarded. 

According to police, Nicholas Ortiz wasn't related to the victims (despite sharing their last name), but had stayed with them.

The arrest came out of the blue on Friday and was the first major development in the four-year-old case, which left the victims' family and El Rancho residents frustrated with the lumbering investigation. 

The Santa Fe New Mexican reported that in the past four years, investigators never revealed if they had potential leads or knew of the motives behind the slayings.

Poser: Nicholas Ortiz, 20, of Pojoaque was charged with three counts of murder, tampering with evidence, and bribery or intimidation of a witness

Killed: On Father’s Day 2011, Lloyd and Dixie Ortiz along with their 21-year-old son Steven were found murdered with a pick-axe in their El Rancho home

Murdered: Steven Ortiz, the couple's 21-year-old adopted son had been bludgeoned to death

Behind bars: Nicholas Ortiz would have been 16 at the time of the killings. He is now in the Santa Fe County jail and is being held without bond

State police have remained silent about why it has taken so long to make an arrest. In a statement issued Friday, the agency described it as a 'complex investigation.'

The department also remained silent when asked why they believe Ortiz, who would have been 16 at the time, killed the Ortiz family.

According to a police affidavit filed in court Monday, witnesses told investigators Nicholas Ortiz was out to steal $20,000 from a safe at the residence. He allegedly told friends that he killed the family, panicked and then ran out of the house.

Police found the bodies had been brutally mutilated. 

Tragic: Lloyd Ortiz, who operated a tile business at the same address, was found face down outside the home. His adopted son, Steven Ortiz, right, was found in the kitchen

Not in their name: Although Nicholas Ortiz shares the same last name as the victims, he is not related to them

Cross to bear: The murders shocked and terrified the community of El Rancho near Espanola. As the years went on, the family’s pleas for any leads in the case grew more desperate

Autopsy reports said the three died from blunt force trauma, and the murder weapon was a pickax. Steven Ortiz had been struck 17 times, Lloyd Ortiz seven times and Dixie Ortiz twice

 After the bodies were discovered on Father’s Day at the family’s El Rancho home, state police initially said the Ortizes had been shot, but officials later recanted that story. 

Investigators who returned to the scene found a blood-covered, 5-pound pickax in a field near the family’s home. 

Nicholas' father and mother appealed to the judge during Monday's hearing to allow their son to be released. The Albuquerque Journal reported that the father said Ortiz was not a flight risk and had cooperated with police throughout the investigation.

Cherie Ortiz, Lloyd and Dixie's daughter, urged the judge to keep Nicholas Ortiz in jail. She said the families live close to each other and she considered Nicholas Ortiz a threat.

'It's not safe for our family and the community,' she said.

Ortiz was denied bond during a hearing Monday at which his parents asked that he be allowed to live with them pending his trial. No trial date has been set.

Sigh of relief: For the small community, the arrest is the news they’ve waited for, for nearly four years. But it was met with mixed emotion
