Joan Fontaine's Oscar was withdrawn from a charity auction after the Academy threatened to sue because if wasn't first offered to them for $1, representatives of the actress's estate have said.  

The award was expected to
fetch between $200,000 to $300,000 at Christie's auction house in New York, with proceeds earmarked for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Monterey County in California. 

This was in line
with Fontaine's wishes. The actress died aged 96 last year.

Actress Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role in Hitchcock's Suspicion, wanted the proceeds of the sale to go to an animal charity after her death last year

But the estate says it withdrew Fontaine's Oscar from a
much-anticipated auction when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences threatened to sue over its sale.

Oscars rarely come up for auction because, since 1950, the
Academy has required winners, their heirs or estates not
sell an Oscar without first offering it to the Academy for just $1.

Fontaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1941 for her
role in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Suspicion, starring alongside Cary
Grant.

At the time was the youngest-ever Best Actress winner and the only actor to win an Oscar for a Hitchcock film.

'The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was unmoved
in the pleadings of all involved, and announced they would file
suit if the sale continued,' representatives for the estate said
in a statement.

It noted that Fontaine's Oscar was awarded 
well before the now-required legal agreement regarding sales.

'We feel that to fight this promised legal suit against the
estate (and SPCA), everyone except the lawyers would lose,' the
statement added.

The Academy said: 'The Academy, its members and the many film artists and
craftspeople who've won Academy Awards believe strongly that
Oscars should be won, not purchased.

'Unfortunately, despite our objections, we don't have the
legal means of stopping the sale of certain statuettes,
including this one.'

But Noel Beutel, a senior trustee for Fontaine's estate,
responded: 'They (the Academy) told us they will sue us if we
sell it.'

In her will, Fontaine stated the proceeds from the sale of her estate, including her $3million California mansion should be left to the animal welfare organization.

The SPCA stands to gain a million dollar donation from the sale of Fontaine's home and the contents of the property in Carmel, which include fine art, silver and furniture — will also be sold at auction to benefit the charity. 

Proceeds from the sale were due to go to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Monterey County in line with Fontaine's wishes
