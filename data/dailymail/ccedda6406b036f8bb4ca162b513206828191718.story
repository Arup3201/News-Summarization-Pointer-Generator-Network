Andy Murray further allayed fears about his left shoulder as Great Britain enjoyed a winning start in the Hopman Cup in Perth.

Having only arrived in Australia the previous afternoon from Abu Dhabi, the British No 1 teamed up with Heather Watson to defeat France 2-1 in the mixed team exhibition event. 

After winning his singles match and seeing Watson lose hers, the two combined to beat Benoit Paire and Alize Cornet 6-4, 2-6, 10-8 in the mixed doubles. Murray’s left shoulder hurt a little, as did his pride at being aced by Cornet before victory was secured.

‘It’s a bit sore, if it was my right shoulder it would probably be quite hard for me to play,’ said Murray after winning 6-2, 7-5 against Paire. ‘I don’t feel it on my ground strokes so much, I feel it when I’m serving. I had a scan in Abu Dhabi and it was absolutely clear but still quite sore.

‘Hopefully it will calm down. Maybe it’s playing matches again after a break, maybe I’ve just got it in the wrong position and tweaked something, but I should be fine.’

Watson had gone down 6-2, 6-2 against Cornet, and will be looking to gain some momentum when she and Murray face Poland on Wednesday.

The Australian Open begins in Melbourne a week on Monday and Victoria Azarenka, winner in two out of the last three years, will be among the unseeded players. After missing much of last season Azarenka will be out of the top 32 after losing 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 to Karolina Pliskova at the Brisbane Open.

The first rankings of the year placed Britain’s James Ward at 101, and with few points to defend over the next few months he ought to crack the top 100 for the first time.

He is also on the cusp of becoming a rare second direct British men’s entry into Melbourne with several players, including Marin Cilic, expected to drop out through injury.
