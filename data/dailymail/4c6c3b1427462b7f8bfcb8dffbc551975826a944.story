A festive family has spent thousands of pounds turning their home into their very own Santa's grotto.

Grandfather-of-four Jim Cooper, 59, and his wife, 56, have been transforming their semi-detached house into a winter wonderland to celebrate Christmas for the last ten years.

The entire building is covered from top to bottom in twinkling fairy lights while the front garden is full of illuminated Christmas-themed ornaments.

Carol and Jim Cooper from West Moseley in Surrey, have spent the last 10 years transforming their home into a winter wonderland

The house and garden is covered in more than 40 sets of lights and there are at least 15 inflatables - including several life-sized Santas as well as a Winnie The Pooh and Tiger wearing Father Christmas outfits

Mr Cooper said: 'We love doing this every year and seeing the reactions of the children.

'Many insist on coming round every day to look at the house and a lot of adults love it too. We like to help get people in the Christmas spirit and have a bit of fun.'

The house and garden is covered in more than 40 sets of lights and there are at least 15 inflatables - including several life-sized Santas as well as a Winnie The Pooh and Tiger wearing Father Christmas outfits.

There is even a rotating Merry-Go-Round complete with elves swinging from Christmas candy canes.

Another unique garden feature is an igloo with a snowman which leaps out at intervals before hiding back inside.

But the finishing touch is a snow machine which pumps out dozens of litres of snow at the flick of a switch, blanketing the house and garden in West Molesey, Surrey, within minutes.

Making use of CCTV they installed to ward of vandals, the couple catch unsuspecting passers-by by surprise, flicking the switch to start the snow-making machine, which douses their front garden with dozens of litres of snow

The incredible display has cost the couple more than £5,000 over the years - with each inflatable costing between £80 and £300 - and Mr and Mrs Cooper say they plan to continue adding to it

The couple first started decorating their home at the behest of their 32-year-old daughter Clare, who wanted to put up a decoration of Santa climbing up the side of the house

Mr Cooper said: 'We installed CCTV outside a few years ago after the display was vandalised - the inflatables were all cut with a knife.

'But we have quite a bit of fun with the CCTV now and turn on the snow machine when we spot someone on the camera coming near the house.

'People now think the snow machine has a sensor or something on it and we watch them on the little screen in our living room jumping up and down in front of the snow machine to try and get it to turn on.

'Then when they go to walk away we turn it on and they come running back. It's a lot of fun.'

The incredible display has cost the couple more than £5,000 over the years - with each inflatable costing between £80 and £300 - and they plan to continue adding to it.

But, perhaps fortunately for the couple, they don't know how much it costs them in electricity to run it.

'We pay a set amount by direct debit every month,' Mr Cooper explained. 'So we don't actually know how much it costs to run all the Christmas lights and the inflatables, which each have their own fans to keep them upright, as the electricity bill seems to even out over the year.'

The inflatables’ fans are turned on at 9am so they can be seen throughout the day and the lights are switched on by a timer at 4pm every day. The couple turn everything off around 10pm.

Mr Cooper and his wife, who have two children, first started decorating their home at the behest of their daughter Clare, 32, who wanted to put a decoration of Santa climbing up a ladder on the side of the house.

It grew from there and the couple have been building up their Christmas decorations collection ever since.

Mr Cooper, a father-of-two, said: 'A couple of years ago my daughter, who's just a big kid, wanted us to put this Santa on the side of the house.

'So at first we just had that one Santa but then we kept adding something every year until we decided seven years ago to go all out and turn it into a Christmas house.

'We try to get something new every year and move things round a bit to make it look a bit different.

'We also buy lots of light bulbs in bulk so we can replace any that break.

The couple, who have four grandchildren, have dedicated this year's display to raising money for a local school for children with learning difficulties

Mr Cooper, a father-of-two, said: 'It does take quite a bit of work but we love doing it'

'It does take quite a bit of work but we love doing it. ‘

It now takes the couple three days to set up display before the lights can be switched on December 1. The couple put on the lights every day over the Christmas period before they start taking it down on the weekend before January 6.

Mr Cooper said: 'We like to make sure everything is ready for the lights to be switched on December 1 - to mark the start of Christmas.

'We set the counter on the front door which then runs down the days until Christmas Day.'

The house has become an attraction for locals with many parents bringing their children by to see the spectacular display.

Mr Cooper said: 'The kids absolutely 
love it. We’ve had parents tell us the lights drive them mad because 
their kids insist on being driven to see them every day until Christmas 
is over.

'We also have groups from the Brownies and Rainbows and I dress up as Santa for them.'

It takes the couple three days to set up display before the lights can be switched on December 1. They put the lights on every day over the festive period before dismantling the display on the weekend prior to January 6

And after all their hard work keeping their Christmas display working all month, Mr and Mrs Cooper will be able to put their feet up on Christmas Day as a relative will be cooking the traditional turkey dinner.

Mr Cooper added: 'It will be nice not to be the one waking up at 6am to put the turkey on this year.

'But we always have a big traditional, family celebration and this year will be no different.

'Christmas is our favourite time of year and we like to take the opportunity to bring a bit of happiness and Christmas spirit to our friends and neighbours.

'None of our neighbours have ever complained about the lights - just that they've sometimes struggled to park because so many people stop their cars to look our lights.'
