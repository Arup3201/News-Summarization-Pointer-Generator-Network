Free-range eggs have outsold those from caged hens for the first time.

Last year 51 per cent of the nine billion eggs laid in the UK came from barn, free-range or organic farm hens. The official figures are in stark contrast to 1995, when 86 per cent came from battery cages.

Experts believe consumers started switching to free range eight years ago after rules made farmers state how their eggs were produced.

Cracking news: 51% of the eggs sold in Britain last year were free range - the first time they have outsold battery

The trend has gathered pace despite free range costing four pence more on average than caged varieties.

Many retailers such as Waitrose, the Co-op and Marks & Spencers have stopped selling eggs from caged birds altogether.

Barren battery cages were banned by the European Union at the start of this year. Their replacement, ‘enriched’ cages, have perches and litter for pecking but still only give each hen less usable space than an A4 sheet of paper.

The RSPCA estimates they are used to rear 16 million hens in Britain to produce eggs mainly for the catering industry.

Alice Clark, a senior scientist from the RSPCA's farm animals team, said: 'Things are certainly getting better and hopefully one day cages will be a thing of the past altogether.

'Shoppers who buy cage-free eggs deserve a heartfelt thank you. And if they want to do more they can make sure food they buy such as ready-meals, cakes and ice-cream also contains cage-free eggs.

'This is a massive step forward for animal welfare especially when you consider in 1995 that more than eight out of ten eggs were laid by hens kept in cruel barren battery cages.

Free range: Typically non-battery eggs cost four pence more than battery

'On the downside about 16 million hens in the UK are still kept in cages with less usable space than an A4 sheet of paper each.

'We mustn't forget that many of their eggs will be used in catering, at restaurants or as ingredients in ready-made meals and food such as cakes, sandwiches and ice-cream.'

With Shrove Tuesday approaching, the RSPCA is urging consumers to choose free range eggs for their pancake mix.

Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, which represents producers, said: 'There's a greater demand for non-caged eggs and egg producers have responded to that.'

The figures were released in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) egg statistics for February 2012.
