President Obama has largely dismissed the disastrous launch of healthcare.gov by insisting that consumers can also apply for health insurance on the telephone or via paper applications, but internal notes revealed today show the Dept. of Health and Human Services knew paper applications would be 'stuck in the same queue.'

According to notes from inside an HHS 'war room' set up to troubleshoot the website in its calamitous first days, stakeholders were told on October 11 that '[t]he paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provides another option; at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue.'

The notes were released Monday by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which obtained them from the Logistics Management Institute, a website contractor, not from the Obama administration.

The HHS war room' learned two weeks ago that paper Obamacare applications were 'stuck in the same queue' with attempts to visit healthcare.gov

The main Obamacare website highlights four methods for applying for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, but they all rely on the dysfunctional website to determine who's eligible for government subsidies

The committee has subpoenaed HHS for documents like these, since it has so far ignored more polite requests.

Contractors for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have to manually enter data from paper applications into the same website that consumers use â€“ the hapless and error-prone site that has been down nearly as much as it's been up since its October 1 launch.

Americans signing up for Obamacare coverage on the telephone, or with the help of 'navigators' tasked with providing community-level assistance, face the same problem: Both methods rely on healthcare.gov.

And when the site is offline, no one's application gets through.

'The same portal is used to determine eligibility [for government subsidies] no matter how the application is submitted (paper, online),' reads another section of the war room notes.

On the same day the HHS war room was advised to tell navigator groups to stop using the Obamacare website and use paper applications, the president emphasized the hand-written approach in a White House Rose Garden speech

On Oct.15 the war room heard that '[n]avigators are seeing people very frustrated and walking away, so they are turning to paper applications to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help, even though paper applications will not have a quicker result necessarily.'

By October 21, the navigators were reporting enough problems accessing the website that healthcare.gov team leaders were given marching orders to tell them to stop using it.

'[W]e are to instruct Navigators to use paper applications rather than go through the call center,' that day's notes read.

On that shat same day, President Obama said during a Rose Garden speech about the problems with healthcare.gov told Americans they could use paper applications.

U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, chairs the House Oversight Committee, and has been the most active investigator digging into Obamacare's failures

'We updated the website's home page to offer more information about the other avenues to enroll in affordable health care until the online option works for everybody,' the president said.

'So you'll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in.'

Excerpts from the same war room meetings held earlier in October showed that HHS only enrolled six people in new Obamacare insurance plans on the first day healthcare.gov was open, and fewer than 250 on the second day.

But by October 21, one of the contractors tasked with hand-entering information from paper applications reported that it had received 3,000 such requests for health insurance coverage.

The Obama administration needs to recruit 7 million new applicants by the end of March, or about 38,500 per day.
