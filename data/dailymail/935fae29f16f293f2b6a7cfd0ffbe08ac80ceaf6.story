A HIV+ nurse was sentenced  to three years in jail today for criminal negligence after she pricked herself with a needle before injecting a child.

Rosemary Namubiru, 64, was convicted for using a intravenous needle on the child after pricking herself - a decision slammed as 'deeply flawed' by HIV/AIDS campaigners.

Throughout her trial, the nurse maintained she was not acting in malice and the incident was an accident. Two tests have shown the child was not infected with HIV, according to court records.

Scores of international activist groups 
rallied around the nurse - saying she was the victim of stigma and 
discrimination because of her HIV status and should not face trial.

Despite their support, she was found guilty of criminal negligence for allegedly in court today and sentenced to three years behind bars.

In November last year all direct aid was cut following a corruption scandal in the country. However, it will still receive £97.9million in aid from the UK this year, The Department for International Development said.

A DFID spokesperson said: 'We ended direct payments to the Ugandan government last year.'

According to the Overseas Development Institute, the country received $1.6bn (£960m) in total from western countries in 2011, making it the world's 20th largest aid recipient.

Following the incident in January this year, the nurse was later denied bail in a controversial decision by a magistrate who ruled that she posed a danger to the public.

International activists rallied behind the nurse - claiming she was charged and convicted because she had HIV

The nurse was charged under a colonial-era law against negligence that 
spreads a deadly disease.

However, since she was charged Ugandan lawmakers have passed a law 
specifically criminalizing the intentional transmission of HIV as part 
of the government's efforts to stem the growing rate of HIV in this East
 African country.

That measure also has been criticised by groups that 
say such a law will be difficult to enforce and may also be used to 
violate the rights of people living with HIV.

Some organisations said her trial was unwarranted and she should only have faced disciplinary action from the local nurses' association.

Asia Russell from the Global Access Project said: 'The
 deeply flawed ruling shows that stigma and discrimination against 
people with HIV is alive and well in Uganda.

'Because of her HIV 
status, Rosemary's trial was plagued from the beginning with bias. 
Rosemary never had the presumption of innocence the Constitution 
guarantees.'

Many Ugandans, however, see her case as a shocking example of malice or negligence by a trusted medical worker.

Namubiru's arrest was widely covered in the Ugandan press, with some dubbing her the 'killer nurse' - a description that some activists said violated her right to a fair trial.

According to the most recent survey by Uganda's Ministry of Health, 7.3 percent of the Ugandan population has HIV - up from about 6 percent a decade ago.

At least 60 countries criminalize the transmission of HIV or the failure to disclose one's HIV status to sex partners, according to AIDS-Free World.
