Phil Jones is set to be offered an improved contract at Manchester United.

The 22-year-old defender, who featured as part of Louis van Gaal's revised 3-5-2 system in United’s opening-day defeat against Swansea, has two years remaining on his contract.

But the Old Trafford outfit are set to offer the England international a new five-year deal which will see him pocket £75,000-a-week, an increase on his current £50,000-a-week wages.

United are not expected to announce the deal in the imminent future, but it is thought there will not be any issues with the agreement of the new contract.

Jones’ former team-mate Gary Neville meanwhile, has called on Jones and team-mates Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Michael Carrick to step up and be counted this term.

‘Big personalities like Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have gone, and new leaders and characters need to emerge in the dressing room,’ said Neville in his ambassador's column in the United Review.

‘This is now the opportunity for Phil Jones, David De Gea, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera - players who've been signed - to become leaders and develop the mentality that they want to take over the mantle.

‘That's particularly true for the ones who have been there for a period of time. Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher and Jonny Evans are the five obvious players who have won many honours between them, now they need to step up.'
