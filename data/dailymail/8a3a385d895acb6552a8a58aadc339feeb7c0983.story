Convicted: Colton Bridgeman, 20, was jailed for five years for robbing two elderly shoppers

A robber who mugged a disabled pensioner man for £10 and a 78-year-old woman for £6 wept as he was jailed for five years.

Colton Bridgeman, 20, ran up behind the elderly man as he walked with a zimmer frame in Ipswich, Suffolk.

Bridgeman, a drug addict, rifled through the shell-shocked 89-year-old's pockets, taking out his belongings and throwing them on the floor.

The callous man pushed his victim against a wall before running off with just £10 on August 10.

Two days later a 78-year-old woman was cruelly targeted.

Again Bridgeman ran up behind her and snatched her purse containing just £6 cash from her handbag.

Both victims were targeted after they had been shopping in a town centre Sainsbury's.

Bridgeman, of Harwich, Essex, admitted two offences of robbery.

He also asked for seven offences, including theft and burglary, to be considered.

He wept as he was given five years detention at a young offenders' institution.

Ipswich Crown Court heard how the robber had caused great distress to his elderly victims.

Speaking about the disabled pensioner, Marcus Croskell, prosecuting, said: 'He was so flabbergasted he sat down. He was very upset.'

Mr Croskell said Bridgeman was later picked out on a video identification parade by a woman in an electric wheelchair who went to the man's aid and challenged the thug.

'She was shocked and shouted after him,' said Mr Croskell.

Recorder Stephen Solley, QC, told 
Bridgeman, who was crying as he was taken down, that his robberies were 
'crimes of great cowardice'.

Mr Solley said he was staggered' that anyone could commit such crimes against two elderly people.

Paul Donegan, defending, said Bridgeman had a tough time as a teenager but that did not excuse his offending.

He said Bridgeman had used Class A drugs and had committed offences to feed his drug habit.

Mr Donegan branded his robberies 'opportunistic'.
