A naked man is Tasered without warning as he is strip-searched in a police cell.

Daniel Dove, 23, is struck in the chest and collapses to the floor in agony as the stun gun continues to deliver a 50,000-volt shock.

CCTV footage of the incident was leaked yesterday after a chief constable refused to publish it despite a judge saying he should. The officer who fired the Taser, PC Lee Birch, 30, was cleared of assault this week but now faces a police inquiry for gross misconduct. He remains on duty.

Mr Dove was arrested at 2am on December 23, 2012 on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly after being thrown out of a nightclub in Trowbridge, Wiltshire.

This footage shows the moment PC Lee Birch sent Daniel Dove crashing to the floor of the police cell, Tasering the suspect after he threw his underpants in the police officer's face

The 23-year-old was escorted into the cell by three police officers, for a strip search

Mr Dove had been arrested on December 23, 2013 for being drunk and disorderly outside a nightclub in Trowbridge, Wiltshire

He claims police pushed him into a puddle on the ground as they handcuffed him and took him to Melksham police station.

The carpenter was put in a cell, where PC Birch – holding his Taser behind his back – began a strip search. Mr Dove said he felt humiliated and flicked his wet boxer shorts at the officer’s face. The CCTV footage shows PC Birch instantly swinging his arm round and firing the Taser.

In court, PC Birch admitted his life had not been under threat, but he ‘would not wish to restrain a naked man’ and used the Taser instead.

A jury cleared him of assault and misconduct in a public office. Mr Dove was charged with assaulting PC Birch and another officer during his arrest but the case was dropped.

He says police chiefs initially ignored his official complaint but PC Birch and four other officers now face a misconduct inquiry. Yesterday, Mr Dove said: ‘I’m hopeful that he’ll be punished for what he did but I’m not too optimistic given that a court didn’t find him guilty.’

During the CCTV recording PC Birch can be seen to unclip his Taser from his holster within seconds of entering the cell.

He then continues to conceal it behind his back throughout the strip search before deploying it - holding the trigger for seven seconds.

Mr Dove crashes to the ground where PC Birch grabs the boxers and throws them at the wall, before shouting 'you have assaulted me, don't do that again'.

During the week-long trial Mr Dove told the court he was compliant throughout his arrest and gave PC Birch no reason to open fire.

Feeling 'humilated' as he removed his underpants Mr Dove hurled them in PC Birch's face in a 'split second' fit of temper, he told a court

PC Birch, who responded by drawing his Taser gun from behind his back zapping Mr Dove with the 50,000-volt weapon, was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and misconduct in public office

PC Birch, who held on to the trigger for seven seconds while Mr Dove fell to the floor, was acquitted on both charges by a jury at Bristol Crown Court

Despite a judge ruling the horrifying footage could now be released to the media, Patrick Geenty, Wiltshire's Chief Constable, objected. The video was later leaked to ITV West Country by a concerned member of the public

He said: 'I was compliant up until a point when I felt like I was being humiliated, I was stripped completely naked and put on my knees with hand cuffs on.

'PC Birch asked me to get naked in a strip search, which I did.

'You feel quite embarrassed, when I took them off it was a split second thing, I did it because I was annoyed.'

He added: 'I was not aware he had a Taser, he didn't tell me he had it or that he intended to use it.

'As soon as I flicked my pants at him he pulled his arm up from behind his back and shot me with it.

'He has not pulled it from a holster and said "I will shoot you", he has just pulled it from behind his back and shot me.

'I didn't have any time to react or move, by the time I saw it.

'I don't know why he used it, I couldn't exactly move because there were three guys there so for him to use that on me was a bit irrational.'

The trial heard how Dove was arrested
 in the early hours of December 23, 2012 outside a nightclub in 
Trowbridge, Wiltshire after clashing with another man.

Bouncers called police when he refused to cooperate and he was detained for being drunk and disorderly.

During the arrest he allegedly tried to punch PC Birch and kneed his colleague PC Reed in the groin.

Dove was then taken into custody at Melksham where he was escorted to a cell by PC Birch and two other officers to be searched.

The
 court heard how PC Birch unclipped his Taser from his holster within 
seconds of entering the cell with the two others and held it behind his 
back throughout.

PC Birch told the court he was 'not looking for an excuse to use the Taser' and said he believed it was 'reasonable and proportionate and not motivated by anger or malice'

The jury saw CCTV footage of Dove, who admitted drinking four pints of Fosters and two Jagerbombs, struggling with PC Birch.

PC Birch told the court he was 'not looking for an excuse to use the Taser' and said he believed it was 'reasonable and proportionate and not motivated by anger or malice'.

He now faces an internal inquiry and investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

A Taser is an electroshock weapon that uses electrical current to inhibit voluntary control of muscles, causing neuromuscular incapacitation.

A person struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscular contractions.

They were introduced as non-lethal weapons to be used by police officers to aphrend fleeing, belligerent or potentially dangerous suspects.

A Police Executive Research Forum study from 2009 revealed officer injuries drop by 76 per cent when a Taser is used.

Critics have argued that Tasers and other high-voltage stun guns can cause cardiac arrhythmia in susceptible suspects, which can lead to heart attack and death in some cases.

Those susceptible to the reaction are sometimes healthy and unaware of their susceptibility.
