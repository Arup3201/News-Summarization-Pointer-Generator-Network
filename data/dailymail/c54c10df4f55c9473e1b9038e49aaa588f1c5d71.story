The most senior judge in England and Wales has rejected calls for specialist courts to deal with cases of child sexual exploitation but judges will be handpicked by a specialist panel

Sex offence trials involving vulnerable children are to be conducted by a team of specially vetted judges, the Lord Chief Justice said yesterday.

The small group of highly experienced judges will also undergo ‘bespoke training’ to help protect weak and exposed child witnesses, Lord Judge said.

His decision to introduce tighter restrictions on the list of judges who can run the most sensitive and potentially brutal sexual exploitation cases was sent to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee, who expressed concerns recently over the way some trials were conducted.

The move follows deepening alarm at the treatment of children by lawyers and judges in cases involving paedophilia charges and alleged sex gangs.

Lord Judge said the new rules will apply to the choice of judges who sit in serious sex cases in which one of the witnesses is regarded as ‘significantly vulnerable’ and is expected to give evidence ‘in circumstances that call for especially sensitive handling’.

The system will also operate in cases that involve a number of defendants and are expected to go on for more than ten days.

Judges in such cases are already chosen from a list of trained and experienced judiciary who are supposed to be versed in methods of stopping defence lawyers from subjecting child witnesses to ‘oppressive’ cross examination.

But Lord Judge told committee 
chairman Keith Vaz that while he thought the system worked ‘extremely 
well’, he accepted that there were a ‘very few cases in which valid 
criticisms have been made of the treatment of vulnerable witnesses’.

The move is in response to concerns about how young people are cross-examined during cases

Under the new system, judges will be 
on the sex case list only if they have been approved by the Presiding 
Judge, who is in charge of a regional circuit of courts, and the 
Resident Judge, who is the chief judge at the Crown Court involved.

The Senior Presiding Judge, Lord 
Justice Gross, will have final approval of ‘the limited number of judges
 who are likely to be selected to try these cases’.

A judge will be picked from the list for each case that qualifies.

There will also be bespoke training 
from the Judicial College, the body responsible for training judges and 
providing guidelines on how to conduct trials. This will ‘focus 
particularly on how best to conduct trials involving significantly 
vulnerable witnesses, as well as addressing the undoubted difficulties 
posed by multi-defendant trials’.

Lord Judge also promised updated 
guidelines on how to conduct trials and named three senior judges who 
will try to find ways of protecting children who give evidence.

Judge Peter Rook QC, who earlier this
 year gave life sentences to five Oxford men who abused girls as young 
as 11, will act  as mentor to judges on the sex case list. Judge Sally 
Cahill QC will take part in Whitehall talks on fighting child sex abuse,
 and Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot is already running a scheme 
to try to ensure cases with very young witnesses come quickly to trial.

But Lord Judge rejected the idea of 
sending child sex trials to special courts. He said that could have 
unintended consequences, including high expense and long waiting times 
because of the limited numbers of courtrooms, judges and court staff.

A victim was abused by a gang of Asian men from the age of 13 then had to endure a harrowing cross-examination in front of her abusers in court (picture posed by model)

By Michael Seamark

She was a damaged and vulnerable teenage girl, who had been ‘passed around and used as meat’ by a gang of Asian men since she was 13 years old.

Then she had to spend 12 days in the witness box, facing cross-examination from defence barrister after defence barrister, until she finally broke down.

Her friend, who was also sold for sex by the men, had an even more horrifying experience, and ended up sobbing as she gave evidence.

Jurors were visibly angry and dismayed at the aggressive tactics of one particular  lawyer. Another barrister walked out of court in disgust.

Their appalling treatment, in a case that critics say shamed British justice, prompted yesterday’s moves to provide child victims of sex abuse with greater protection in criminal trials.

The girls gave evidence in two trials, and at both they were cross-examined by barrister Mohammed Tayyab Khan.

In the summer of 2011, seven men from  Telford went on trial at Stafford Crown Court accused of turning young white girls into ‘sexual commodities’, who were trafficked and sold to dozens of men.

Among the defendants was Ahdel Ali, who was represented by Mr Khan.

In the original trial the first girl, by now aged 18, was cross-examined by a succession of defence lawyers. Some of them challenged her evidence in a methodical way but others were far less restrained.

During aggressive questioning, Leicester-based Mr Khan accused her of ‘telling lies’, giving ‘phoney evidence’ and being a ‘very dishonest girl’. He even asked her whether she repented her ‘sins’.

Next the girl’s friend, now aged 19, gave evidence. Mr Khan accused her of being ‘very wicked’ and making ‘false and malicious allegations’.

He then went on to question her about an incident unconnected to the men on trial.When she was 13, she had confided in her mother that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather.

Her mother called the police and the girl initially gave a detailed statement. But, as she explained to the jury, she withdrew it a day later because she was concerned about the impact on her mother.

At times shouting at the girl, Mr Khan used it to argue that her evidence in court could not be trusted.

His method was to force the sobbing teenager to read statement containing her original allegations against her stepfather out loud.

The girl was distraught, jurors were shaking their heads, and concerned Judge Robin Onions asked whether it was necessary.

Mr Khan said it was. After more complaints he agreed to read out lines from the statement himself, but the teenager’s distress continued.

The trial eventually collapsed and was split into a series of retrials.

Twelve months later, the second trial of the Crown v Ahdel Ali began at the same court with a new judge, Patrick Thomas QC, in charge.

Judge Thomas made his opinion of the conduct of the original trial clear.

‘The way things went last time is just so wrong that we should all be ashamed that our justice system allowed it,’ he said.

The two girls were again witnesses but Mr Khan’s questioning took a different course.

Before Mr Khan cross-examined the second girl the judge warned him that he would not be allowed to repeat the distress caused at the previous trial.

He rebuked the barrister when he attempted to delve into the incident involving the girl’s stepfather.

The judge asked him: ‘Is it difficult for you to understand that she finds all this troublesome and embarrassing and it has nothing to do with the case?’

At the end of the second trial, Mr Khan’s 25- year old client was found guilty of rape, 11 counts of sexual activity with a child, inciting child prostitution,  inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and meeting a child after sexual grooming. Ali was jailed for 18 years.

Mr Khan has said that he was doing his professional duty.
