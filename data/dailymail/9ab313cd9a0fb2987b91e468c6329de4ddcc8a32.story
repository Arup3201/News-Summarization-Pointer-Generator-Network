Tragic: Alan Cartwright, pictured, was stabbed to death as he cycled along a north London street

The sister of a 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death as he cycled along a north London street with his friends has paid tribute to her brother who was full of 'laughter and joys.'  

Alan Cartwright was killed after being confronted by three men in Caledonian Road, Islington, London, on Friday evening.

He managed to continue cycling a short distance after he was stabbed, but collapsed and died in the street shortly afterwards.

The attackers stole two of the teenager's friends' bikes before they fled, police said.

A murder probe has been launched and police are hunting for the three attackers.

Alan's sister Cherrie organised a candlelit vigil for her brother on Saturday night, near to the spot where he was killed.

She told Sky News: 'It's deeply affected all of us.

'He was every sort of personality you can think of, really, all wrapped in one. He had his moments, but he beat them with his laughter and his jokes and joys.' 

She said the family still knew little about what had happened to the teenager on Friday evening.  

Officers are currently analysing CCTV footage in the area for clues as to the identity of the teenager's attackers. A post-mortem is also due to take place.

Friends took to Twitter to pay tribute to Alan, known by the nickname Little Al. 

One person posted on Twitter in tribute to the 15-year-old and said: 'So sad that another Islington kid taken so soon. Thinking of your family at this sad time.'

Another added: 'Devastated isn't the word! RIP Alan.'

Former EastEnders actor Brooke Kinsella, whose 16-year-old brother Ben was knifed to death in north London in 2008, said: 'Another young boy lost to knife crime, another family destroyed. Sickening, cowardly, senseless culture. Heart is weary #PutDownYourKnives'

Ms Kinsella has been a prominent and tireless anti-knife crime campaigner in the wake of her brother's death. 

Tributes have been left at the scene, following the murder which took place at about 7.30pm on Friday. One handwritten note attached to a bouquet of flowers reads, 'we are lost for words for what has happened'.

A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: 'At this early stage it is believed the victim was cycling north on Caledonian Road with friends when they were attacked, near the junction of Copenhagen Street, by three males who were walking in the opposite direction.

Alan Cartwright was cycling with friends when he suffered a single stab wound and later collapsed and died 

'The victim suffered a single stab wound during the attack and two other members of the group had their bikes stolen. The victim managed to cycle further up Caledonian Road before collapsing.

'The suspects made off from the scene, continuing south down Caledonian Road.' 

Anyone with information is asked to contact police.

Tributes: Candles, photographs and flowers were all laid at Caledonian Road, where Alan was killed

Touching: This handwritten note left in tribute said Alan's 'youthful spirit will live on forever'
