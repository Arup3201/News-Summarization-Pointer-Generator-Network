The Homeland Security Department is backing away from an idle warning issued Sunday by Secretary Jeh Johnson, who had said a Somali terror group's threat against the Mall of America would complicate the possibility that his agency could be partially shut down by the weekend.

Congress is still battling over a DHS budget that it put on a short leash in December, with Republicans threatening to put the agency in default rather than allowing President Barack Obama to move forward with a plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants.

'If anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they have got to be particularly careful,' Johnson told a CNN audience on Sunday. 

He steered most of the interview toward dire warnings about what would happen if his budget remains in limbo past its Feb. 27 expiration date.

STERN WARNING: On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Mall of America shoppers should be on guard because a Somali terror group had issued a threat of violence

42 MILLION PEOPLE: 'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Johnson said, talking about the US's most popular indoor shopping center

BONE-CHILLING: A video released by the Al-Shabaab terror group on Saturday calledf for attacks on shopping centers including the Mall of America, a Canadian mall, and London's Oxford Street shopping corridor

But on Monday DHS walked Johnson's words back, with spokeswoman Marsha Catron saying that despite a videotaped threat from the Al-Shabaab terror group, 'we are not aware of any specific, credible plot against the Mall of America or any other domestic commercial shopping center.'

Al-Shabaab, the most active jihadi group in Somalia, released a video Saturday online that recalled its involvement in a 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, and urged Muslims to attack three shopping meccas.

The terror network's named targets include the Mall of America, West Edmonton Mall in Canada and London's Oxford Street corridor.

The Kenya mass-shooting killed 67 and injured at least 175.

Saturday's video showed the Mall of America and the shopping center's GPS coordinates. It called for 'Westgate-style' attacks against 'American or Jewish shopping centers.'

The Mall of America welcomes about 42 million shoppers every year – more than eight times Minnesota's entire population – and employs 12,000 people, pumping more than $2 billion into the state's economy.

Overall it occupies 4.8 million square feet, a large enough space to fit seven Yankee stadiums.

Minnesota is the epicenter of Somali immigration into the United States, hosting more than 25,000 refugees from the northeastern African nation.

That's more than 28 per cent of the more than 85,700 such Somalis who live in the United States.

Its head office in Bloomington, Minnesota said in a statement that it would 'continue to monitor events with the help of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. As always, we take any potential threat seriously and respond appropriately.'

'Mall of America has implemented extra security precautions, some may be noticeable to guests, and others won't be. We will continue to follow the situation, along with law enforcement, and will remain vigilant as we always do in similar situations.'

Jim Kallstrom, a former FBI assistant director in New York City, told a Fox News Channel audience on Sunday that the FBI has a 'huge job in front of them.'

'You look at the Mall of America, you look at all the malls then you start to backtrack and say you know it would be nice if we knew what comes and goes into the country,' he said.

'We don't have a clue.'

Johnson remarked on CNN that it's significant to see Al-Shabaab and the ISIS terror army urging Muslims to launch attacks in the West on their behalf.

'We're beyond the phase now where these groups would sendforeign operatives into countries after being trained someplace,' the DHS chief said.

On Monday he appeared for a brief press conference in which he pilloried congressional Republicans for threatening to hold up his agency's budget.

A 'shutdown' wouldn't affect more than 80 per cent of DHS's workforce, since they are considered 'essential' national security personnel – although they would have to wait to get paid until after the stalemate ends.
