Employees at a Texas industrial plant where four died of toxic poisoning last November may have been exposed to potentially deadly gas for years, new findings suggest.

State records obtained by the Houston Chronicle indicate that the DuPont factory in La Porte, Houston, reported regular malfunctions with its multimillion-dollar exhaust and ventilation systems in 2009 and 2010 but nothing was done to resolve the problem.

Based on these disclosures, it's believed that factory staff could have been subjected to dangerous levels of methyl mercaptan - a sulphurous-smelling colorless gas which can irritate the skin, eyes and lungs.

Repeated exposure may cause damage to the liver and kidneys or affect the blood cells causing anemia. High levels can cause loss of consciousness and death.

As much as 600 parts per million of methyl mercaptan an hour could have filled a poorly ventilated room at the DuPont facility, according to estimations. 

But federal guidelines say workers shouldn't be exposed to more than an average of 10 ppm per day of the gas, which is used to manufacture crop-protection products such as insecticides and fungicides. 

Four employees at the DuPont plant died after being exposed to methyl mercaptan during a hazardous leak on November 15. 

A fifth worker was hospitalized and later released after being held for observation. 

Jeff Suggs, emergency management coordinator for La Porte, said the chemical release was not toxic for those living nearby, but that it caused a smell that's similar to rotten eggs.

Federal officials and the state agency are still investigating the incident.

DuPont declined to comment on its workers' potentially prolonged exposure to the gas in light of the new findings.

'Considering individual issues in isolation or speculating can lead to inaccurate conclusions,' DuPont spokesman Aaron Woods said. 

'DuPont is committed to maintaining the integrity of ongoing investigations. To that end, it is premature for us to comment or provide additional information outside of these processes.'

The La Porte plant has more than 300 DuPont employees. 

Four other companies are also tenants at the complex.
