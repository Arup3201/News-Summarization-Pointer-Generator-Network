Whistleblower: Former matron Lynn Smith leaked an email from previous employers Stowe School

A former matron has been left jobless after revealing that a prestigious private school ran out of ‘morning after’ pills.

Lynn Smith had been due to start work at the Royal Ballet School later this year – but last week it withdrew its job offer.

Mrs Smith leaked an email from her previous employers, Stowe School, which was published in The Mail on Sunday last week. It detailed the ‘great concern’ staff had over pupils having sex in the £33,000-a-year school’s boarding houses.

The day after our exposé, Ms Smith received a call from the London-based ballet school – and 24 hours later was told  she could no longer take up her new post as a £19,600- a-year assistant.

She suspects Stowe School had ‘smeared’ her – a claim that headteacher Anthony Wallersteiner strenuously rebuts.

Ms Smith, 57, says she was  warned before the story was published  that the head was threatening to write to the Royal Ballet School if she continued to cooperate with this newspaper.

But Dr Wallersteiner  ‘categorically’ denied contacting the dance school.

The Royal Ballet School confirmed it had ‘no contact’ with the head, although it said its human resources department had been in touch with Stowe’s HR staff the day after the story appeared as part of ‘normal’ checks on references Ms Smith had provided more than a month earlier. 

Ms Smith has nevertheless consulted legal advisers claiming she had been the victim of ‘smears’, including initial suggestions by the school that the email might have been ‘doctored’.

She said: ‘I feel I’m being picked on by some very influential parties. Stowe have over-reacted and been heavy-handed.’

Ms Smith worked at Stowe for two years as a matron, but left earlier this year after bullying claims.

She and a matron friend at Stowe, Terry Sanders, decided to leak the email to expose what they saw as weaknesses in the school’s policies to protect pupils, including its decision to scrap live-in matrons.

On the day before we published the story, Dr Wallersteiner cast doubt on the leaked email, telling us  it may have been ‘altered and doctored to sensationalise a matter of pastoral concern’.

During that day Ms Smith received a call from Ms Sanders, saying that Dr Wallersteiner planned on writing to the Royal Ballet School.

Ms Sanders, who is now suspended from the Buckinghamshire  school, also claimed that she was being ‘threatened with everything’ –including the sack – if she could not persuade Ms Smith to stop the story.

When Ms Smith refused to back down, Dr Wallersteiner enlisted the services of spin doctors Bell Pottinger and media lawyer Schillings.

On Monday Ms Smith was called by the Royal Ballet School’s HR manager Emma Grant who said they had questions over why she had left Stowe. The next day Ms Grant told Ms Smith she had spoken to Stowe and the job offer was withdrawn.

Dr Wallersteiner said; ‘I am sorry the Royal Ballet School have not taken forward her contract.

They have inferred that there was a compromise agreement [over Ms Smith leaving Stowe] and they clearly feel something had gone wrong that make her references perhaps not as robust as they might be. 

What I can say categorically is that I did not contact by any means or by a third party the Royal Ballet School.’

He refused to comment on Ms Sanders’s call to Ms Smith but denied making any threats to Ms Sanders.

However Ms Smith said: ‘I turned whistleblower to expose a serious matter of public interest.  Now I  have lost my prospective job, my future home and my livelihood.’

Memories: Liv Stevens was a sixth former at Stowe School from 2006-2008

The motto at Stowe School, ‘persto et praesto – I persist and I excel’, was a source of inspiration for pupils when I attended. Especially when it came to having sex.

Teachers knew it was happening, but there wasn’t much they could do about it. Confined to the school grounds for weeks at a time with hormones raging, pupils were regularly having sex.

There was a game known as the Temple Challenge, where couples would compete to have sex at all  of the 40 tiny neo-classical buildings in the school’s 750 acres.

In one girls’ boarding house, a tally chart of locations where pupils had sex was updated regularly.  

Pupils had sex anywhere they could: in unlocked classrooms in the evenings, in the cricket pavilion, even outside boarding houses.

I never heard of anyone getting caught, but there were a few close calls.

Once a girl was forced to sneak out of a boy’s  bedroom window when the housemaster came knocking.

These rendezvous weren’t one-night stands, but part of loving relationships – and never underage as the school only accepts girls from 16.

Two old school friends are still going out with the boyfriends they met aged 16.

All the girls knew that the school’s medical centre, the San, stocked the morning-after pill. On at least one occasion I accompanied a friend to get one.

The school should be both open and realistic about sex and accept that it’s better to prepare, and offer pupils contraception if they need it.
