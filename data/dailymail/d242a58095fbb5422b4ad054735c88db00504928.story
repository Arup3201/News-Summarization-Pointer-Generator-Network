Vice president Joe Biden is giving his Republican adversaries something to think about as he reveals his new 'tough guy' official portrait.

Mr Biden folded his arms to adopt a strong pose and showed off a confident smile in the photo, which could be seen as a defiant gesture to Speaker of the House and regular critic, John Boehner.

The photographic portrait was unveiled to mark the Democrat's second term in office.

Say cheese: U.S. vice president Joe Biden poses for his official portrait to mark his second term in office

He is proudly pictured inside his West Wing office at the White House, standing in front of the United States and vice president's flags.

The photograph replaces the previous portrait from 2009, when the vice president posed in front of the two flags and a white back drop.

Critic: Speaker of the House Joe Boehner has been a regular adversary of the president and vice-president

It was taken on January 10 by his official photographer David Lienemann.

The photograph follows the release of a new official portrait of president Barack Obama and the first lady, Michelle.

Mr Biden, who is dubbed Diamond Joe and is considered one of the party's most effective draws for swing voters, has shown few signs of aging since his 2009 portrait.

Mr Obama on the other hand has many more grey hairs, although his grin was much wider than when he posed for his first portrait.

White House photographer, Pete Souza, took the updated picture of the president, who also had his arms folded, in December inside the Oval Office.

Mr Biden, from Scranton, 
Pennsylvania, became one of the youngest people ever to be elected to 
the United States Senate when he was just 29.

He
was sworn in at his two sons' hospital bedsides, after they were 
involved in a car crash, which killed his wife Neilia and 
one-year-old daughter Naomi just weeks after his election.

Mr Biden twice attempted to run for the presidency but dropped out on both occasions. In 1988 he was found to have life-threatening brain aneurysms.
