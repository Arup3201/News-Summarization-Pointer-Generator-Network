The fire-breather instantly gets up and stumbles off with an assistant checking if he's okay.

While the majority of the flames die away, some continue to flicker around the man's arms and neck.

Workers rush over and lay a table upsidedown on the floor to put out a blaze spreading across the ground.

It is not known if the man sustained any injuries.

However, he later appears back on camera wearing no T-shirt, with no apparent burn marks on his body.

Gibson told NBC News that many members of the audience thought the blunder was part of the show because it happened so quickly.

Apparently fire rescue workers were not called out as the flames were put out with minimal damage.

The fire-breather was part of the Ink Iluusionsist tattoo group, which states its goal is to 'bring old world craftsmanship and winning showmanship to our beloved art form that has all too often been the victim of massive misrepresentation.'

A spokesperson from the company has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Performers from Ink Illusionist will next perform high-risk acts at a tattoo convention in Fort Myers, Florida, towards the end of February.
