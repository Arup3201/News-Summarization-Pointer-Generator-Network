Accused: Jamie Waylett, who played a bully at Hogwarts, was allegedly caught in possession of a petrol bomb during the London riots

Harry Potter star Jamie Waylett has been charged with being in possession of a petrol bomb during the London riots this summer and threatening unlawful violence.

When police arrested the actor, 22, they also say they found 15 cannabis plants growing in his bedroom.

He played Draco Malfoy's sidekick Vincent Crabbe in the Harry Potter films alongside Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint.

He appeared in six of the movies about the boy wizard - but was not involved in the final film after his character was written out.

Waylett is also accused of handling a bottle of champagne that had allegedly been looted from a Sainsbury's store in Chalk Farm, North London.

He is the most high-profile person known to have been arrested in connection with disorder which swept across the capital.

He is accused of carrying out the offences on August 8.

Police allegedly found the cannabis plants when they raided his property on September 20.

He has been released on bail on condition that he lives with his mother in a north London flat. He has a 7pm to 7am curfew.

The actor will appear again before Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on November 11.

The Metropolitan Police have now arrested almost 3,000 people in connection with riots in the capital.

He has been charged with having a petrol bomb, threatening unlawful violence, receiving stolen goods and cultivating cannabis.

The charges allege that he was in possession of the petrol bomb and had intent to destroy or damage property.

Waylett denied the offences at a plea and case management hearing.

Violence spread across the capital after father-of-four Mark Duggan was shot dead by police.
