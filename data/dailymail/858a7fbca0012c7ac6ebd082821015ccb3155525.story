Britain is advertising 250,000 jobs in the European Union despite unemployment at home

Britain is advertising 250,000 jobs to job seekers in the European Union creating more competition for unemployed people at home.

Around half the jobs advertised on a taxpayer funded EU website are in Britain, raising questions about the government’s approach to unemployment.

By contrast France has advertised just 14,000 posts for other EU workers and seven countries - have put up so few that they do not register with the European Commission’s EURES work programme.

EURES, the European job mobility portal, is the EU body that advertises British jobs to any EU worker.

The European Union provides grants for unemployed EU workers to get interviews and resettle in another EU country.

No such grant exists for workers in the UK to relocate to find work or get an interview.

The British jobs being advertised in Europe include department managers, general managers, finance and sales jobs, computing posts and clerking posts.

The huge disparity in job listings will fuel claims that the UK goes too far to go along with EU rules while other countries ignore them when they find it inconvenient.

The numbers are disturbing since while unemployment is 7.7 per cent, it has just hit 12 per cent in the Eurozone for the first time since the single currency was formed in 1999.

Tim Aker, of Get Britain Out, warned that the discrepancy is likely to pile further pressure on the UK jobs market.

He said: ‘The Eurozone’s problem is going to become ours. The EU is paying to export Eurozone unemployed to the more prosperous EU member states in a cynical attempt to lower Eurozone unemployment. This will mean more competition for unemployed British workers struggling to get a job.

‘The facts show that labour mobility is only going one way, the jobs are here as the Eurozone destroys the economies of its member states. It’s time we got out of the EU to secure British jobs.’

A European Commission spokesman said the scheme benefited the UK economy, adding: ‘There is no evidence that migrant workers take jobs away from host country workers.’
