The Premier League's chances of sealing a staggering £10million-per-game agreement - and £5 billion overall - from the next three-year domestic rights deal are even stronger now two foreign TV giants are involved.

The battle between Sky Sports and BT Sport in the auction for the seven packages was already such that £10m for each of 168 live games was an achievable target.

But the Premier League also have America's massively-funded Discovery Channel looking closely at the tender document while Qatar-based beIN Sports are discussing whether to bid before the February 6 deadline.

Premier League matches could soon be sold for the equivalent for £10million per game in a new rights deal

Discovery, famous for their documentaries, look the more interested of the two potential new challengers. They own Eurosport so have an established platform on which to screen matches. Even one of the two mini 14-game packages might be seen as a way of establishing the Discovery-Eurosport partnership in the UK. Sports rights specialist Peter Hutton has been appointed Eurosport CEO to build content.

As for beIN Sports, they have the financial muscle to outbid all rivals and it seems a matter of when, rather than if, they will enter England's domestic football market.

Doha executives say they will give serious consideration as to whether now is the right time to move. The competition will delight the Premier League, who sell each of the seven packages to the highest bidder, and it might be that three different networks share content from 2016-17.

The remarkable culling of the over-50s at the England Cricket Board continues with the departure of communications chief Colin Gibson. 

Replacements already in the frame are 40-somethings Will Chignell — who survived the 2011 Rugby World Cup debacle so well that England cricket chief Paul Downton went to Twickenham to study the RFU PR operation — and Chris Haynes, the robotic former Sky Sports spokesman who never went off Isleworth message in 20 years.

The minutes of the last FA protocol committee meeting show once again how this preposterous gathering seems far more interested in feeding their faces than discussing serious issues.

The main topic at the meeting was about the Norwegian FA delegation running slightly late before the friendly international last September, meaning the start of the VIP-match meal in the Wembley Suite had to be delayed.

Greedy blazers were so agitated about having to wait for their food that it was agreed that in future a member of the FA's international relations team will be sent to the opposition's hotel to ensure they set off for Wembley on schedule.

Protocol members decided that from now on they will tuck in at the designated time even if their opposition guests have not yet arrived.

This rush to the trough follows the full council actually taking a vote on whether dessert should be served before the match or at half-time — to the exasperation of FA chairman Greg Dyke.

Alex Mawer, Lawn Tennis Association's director of communications and marketing, arrived at Roehampton from Visit England last September. 

Four months later, he has still to communicate properly with specialist tennis writers despite the LTA's chronic need to improve media relations. Mawer said he has had other priorities.

It's win-win for Ginola

All that needs to be said about the publicity stunt that is David Ginola's candidature for the FIFA presidency is that the Frenchman is keeping his £250,000 fee from bookmakers Paddy Power — who dreamed up the idea — irrespective of whether he gains the necessary support from five national associations by January 29.

The former Tottenham and Newcastle winger, who seemed more clued up about the 2018 Ryder Cup in France — having been on the bid team — admits his knowledge of FIFA politics is slim. When asked at the Team Ginola Reboot FIFA launch how many members of FIFA ExCo he could name, he replied: 'That's a good question, I need to know more about FIFA.' Quite.

Paddy Power, bless 'em, insisted this was a genuine campaign but admitted it will be over in two weeks if Ginola does not win the required nominations. Ginola, all Gallic charm, said nothing much relevant to unseating 78-year-old Sepp Blatter next May.
