A Swedish minister has accused Saudi Arabia of banning her from giving a speech at a meeting of the Arab League after she previously criticised the kingdom's human rights record.

Sweden's foreign minister Margot Wallstroem has claimed that her criticism of Saudi Arabia over its treatment of blogger Raif Badawi resulted in her speech being cancelled at the meeting in Cairo.

Ms Wallstroem had been invited as an honorary guest to the Arab ministers' meeting in praise of her government's decision to recognise Palestine as a state.

However, an Arabic diplomat confirmed that Riyadh had stopped her from making her opening speech.

Ms Wallstroem said: 'The explanation we have been given is that Sweden has highlighted the situation for democracy and human rights and that is why they do not want me to speak.

'It's a shame that a country has blocked my participation.'

The Swedish foreign ministry has now published a version of Ms Wallstroem's speech on its website.

And although it did not mention Saudi Arabia or her feminist foreign policy agenda, it stressed human rights and rights for women.

She was expected to say: 'Freedom of association, assembly, religion and expression are fundamental rights and important tools in the creation of vibrant societies.

'Women's rights do not only benefit women, but society as a whol.e

Ms Wallstroem has rarely commented on Saudi Arabia but in January she slammed the kingdom's treatment of Mr Badawi, who had been sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam.

At the time she said: 'One must protest against what are medieval methods of punishment.'

Yet her country has a decade-long arms-trading deal with Riyadh which is not due for renewal for another five years in May.

The deal has come under fire within Ms Wallstroem's Social Democrats, while their Green Party coalition partners oppose it categorically.
