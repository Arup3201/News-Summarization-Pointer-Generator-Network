When little Oliver Cahill picked up the phone, dialled 999 and asked to speak to Fireman Sam, it sparked an emergency response.

But it was not Oliver’s hero, the fearless fictional TV firefighter, who arrived on the Cahill doorstep. It was a female police officer.

The three-year-old was not impressed, telling her: ‘I wanted Fireman Sam.’

Little Oliver Cahill (pictured with his mother Leanne) picked up the phone, dialled 999 and asked to speak to Fireman Sam, sparking an emergency response. But he was less than impressed when a female police officer answered the call

Oliver’s parents Andrew and Leanne let him play with the phone when it is unplugged at their home in Blackpool, but on this occasion a friend had left it connected and PC Claire Van Deurs Goss came to investigate the 999 call.   

‘I think it tickled her a bit,’ Oliver’s mother said.

Ms Cahill, 31, said: 'My friend had borrowed it to phone their doctor and must have left it plugged in.

'I saw Oliver playing with it in the dining room and thought nothing of it.

Three-year-old Oliver had been using the phone, which parents Andrew and Leanne usually leave unplugged for him to play with, and made it through to the emergency services. But he told the WPC investigating the call: 'I wanted Fireman Sam'

'When the officer came up the path I thought, "Oh my gosh" because I’ve never had any problems with the police.

'They asked me if I had a child at the property and she explained that they had a call from a little child.'

The fearless fictional TV firefighter is little Oliver's hero

Oliver, who was unaware of the seriousness of his actions, was disappointed to see the WPC Van Deurs Goss standing in the doorway.

Ms Cahill added: 'He didn’t want her, he wanted Fireman Sam.

'He knew exactly what he’d done and the lady on the phone asked him why he’d phoned 999. He said he was trying to phone Fireman Sam.'

The phone has now been unplugged - but Oliver still has not given up hope of meeting his hero.

His mother added: 'He’s a big Fireman Sam fan and he’s got all the little action figures.

'He’s been on the phone a few times since but it’s been unplugged.

'Every time he says the same thing, he wants to speak to Fireman Sam.'

PC Van Deurs Goss, who was called to the incident, said: 'When I attended his mum was shocked to see the police there.

'Immediately we saw the offending three-year-old in the room shouting "I wanted Fireman Sam".

'He was a bit put out it was police officers and not a fireman, but at the same time I think he was still very pleased that the police had come to see him.'
