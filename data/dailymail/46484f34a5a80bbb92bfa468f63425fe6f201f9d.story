A woman who was allegedly raped by top defense lawyer Sanford Rubenstein tested negative for drugs following the incident, further complicating her lawyer's attempts to have him charged.

The unnamed accuser, who is an executive at the National Action Network, claims she was raped by Rubenstein, a high-flying New York attorney, in his penthouse apartment last month after the Reverend Al Sharpton's star-studded birthday party.

Lawyers for the woman claim she woke up in the apartment feeling 'foggy', covered in bruises and surrounded by bloody condoms.

However, a toxicology report on her blood - which was taken one week after the October 2 incident - came back clean, subsequently switching the investigation to whether the woman voluntarily or involuntarily consumed alcohol.

'If she voluntarily drank alcohol, it’s hard to prove rape, or rather, to charge him with rape,' a police source told The New York Post.

Rubenstein was reportedly filmed on a security video making out with the woman and her female friend, in an elevator of his Upper East Side apartment complex, according to The New York Daily News.

The woman's lawyers- Kenneth J. Montgomery and Keith White - deny this occurred.

They also say the drug test does not hinder their case.

'The results of any toxicology is of no consequence considering the victim’s injuries, statement and lack of consent,' one lawyer told The Post.

Rubenstein claims what happened between the two was consensual.

He has not been charged with a crime.

On October 3, the day after the alleged incident, the woman - a Brooklyn mother - went to the hospital suffering from vaginal bleeding and bruising.

Her lawyers claim she later used a rape kit and that the results were consistent with sexual assault.

They demanded Rubenstein at least be charged with third-degree rape.

The alleged attack took place after Sharpton's 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant, which was attended by New York mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee

Rubenstein and his alleged victim met at the party and went home to his Upper East Side apartment along with a third person, who later left. 

After the allegations surfaced, NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7 million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and reportedly collected 'biological evidence'.

Allegations: Rubenstein has maintained the encounter was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams

Denial: Rubenstein's own defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said a letter about the alleged victim's injuries is 'offensive and patently false'

Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy.

Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD.

Sharpton has also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' 

He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn't mean you're guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain't no place for that in our community. 

The district attorney's office told the Times the case was being investigated, and declined to comment further. 

Rubenstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, rebutted the letter, saying that 'all evidence to date points to consensual sex between two consenting adults, who were both active and awake throughout.' 

Brafman described the letter as 'offensive and patently false.'
