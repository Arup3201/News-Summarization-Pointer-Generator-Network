For the past four months - his entire life - he has been hooked up to dozens of wires in hospital.

So for his first Halloween, this premature newborn's father decided to do something special. 

Eric Hart, a prop maker from North Carolina, filmed himself creating a pint-sized Iron Man costume for his son, Collier, in a bid to 'help him feel brave'.

Sick: For the past four months - his entire life -  Collier has been hooked up to dozens of wires in hospital

Devoted: For his premature son's first Halloween, Mr Hart (pictured) decided to do something special

Using a paper pattern he found online, which he drastically scaled down, he cut out various sections of the bionic hero's outfit, before tracing the shapes on to pieces of foam.

He then carefully snipped the red and yellow foam and secured the shapes together to form a helmet using hot glue in a workshop at his Burlington home.

The devoted father, who works at Triad Stage, later placed the finished creation on Collier's head as he lay in his mother's arms in intensive care on October 31.

Despite the youngster only donning the outfit for a minute, it seems to have aided his recovery - with Collier apparently 'getting stronger every day'.

Speaking to Right This Minute, Mr Hart said he was inspired to create the Iron Man costume because Tony Stark - like his son - needs to be attached to wires in order to survive.

'Collier's hooked up to the machines all the time and Iron Man, he built the suit because he needed a machine to keep himself alive,' he said. 

'I just thought if he had a little Iron Man suit he could come home with us.'
