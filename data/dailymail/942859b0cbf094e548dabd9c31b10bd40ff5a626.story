Instagram users were outraged this weekend when the photo-sharing website appeared to have taken down a picture of two men kissing on their wedding day.

Celebrity hairdresser Alberto Guzman posted the picture of himself and his husband Janeiro on Sunday in honor of Gay Pride Day, using a series of hashtags including #happy, #gaypride and #equalrights.

But shortly after the photo went up, another user apparently flagged it as inappropriate, prompting the site to take it down - much to the disappointment of the couple and their followers.

Mr Guzman, who married his make-up artist boyfriend of 16 years in May, voiced his outrage in a post on Instagram.

'I posted this photo of my wedding yesterday and Instagram took it off my
 album for being "inappropiate", and on gay pride day of all 
days,' wrote the hairdresser, who has worked with stars including Pink, Emily VanCamp, Bridget Moynahan and Molly Sims.

The post attracted 160 'likes' and prompted dozens of people to re-post it and spread the word.

'Stunning photo,' wrote one friend. 'I don't see anything wrong with two people in love - amazing.' Another person said of the photo removal: 'Outrageous. Love you two! #love #pride #bestcoupleever'.

Outcry: After someone apparently flagged the photo as inappropriate, prompting the site to remove it, supermodel Karen Elson was one of the people to jump to the couple's defense

Double standard: Many pointed out that Instagram has allowed pictures that are far more inappropriate

Even supermodel Karen Elson, who has more than 48,000 followers, jumped to the couple's defense, sharing the photo along with the caption: 'These 2 people just got married and the photo captured the moment, how can you find an expression of love offensive? #allyouneedislove'.

'The photo captured the moment, how can you find an expression of love offensive?'

Others pointed out that the site has allowed far more inappropriate pictures. 'Crazy...especially when there's a gazillion half naked selfies on here daily!' commented one person.

Instagram has since apologized and restored the original photo, calling the removal a 'mistake'.

'When our team processes reports from other members of the Instagram 
community, we occasionally make a mistake,' a spokesperson told MailOnline.

Unfair: Ms Nelson (pictured in November) wrote to her 48,000 followers: 'These 2 people just got married and the photo captured the moment, how can you find an expression of love offensive? #allyouneedislove'

'In this case, we wrongly 
removed content and rectified the error as soon as we were notified.  We
 apologize for any inconvenience.'

According to Instagram's community guidelines, users are not allowed to post pictures that contain 'nudity', 'mature content,' 'prohibited or illegal content' or 'extreme violence or gore'.

'If you wouldn’t show the photo or video you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or your parents, you probably shouldn’t share it on Instagram,' states the website.
