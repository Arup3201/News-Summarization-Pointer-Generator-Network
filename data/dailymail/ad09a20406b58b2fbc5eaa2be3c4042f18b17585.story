The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has warned a New York City clinic of multiple problems uncovered at the facility, it emerged today.

Excerpts of the agency's letter to Yorkville Endoscopy - the same clinic Joan Rivers went to for a throat procedure before she had to be hospitalized and died the following week - were published by The New York Post.

It says 'Based on the findings of the September 5, 2014 survey, Yorkville Endoscopy LLC no longer meets the requirements for participation as a supplier of services in the Medicare program.

'Accordingly, CMS has determined that the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary [of the Department of Health] will be terminated on January 7, 2015.'

Trouble? The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reportedly warned Yorkville Endoscopy of multiple problems uncovered at the facility

The Post reported the inspection letter - stemming from New York State DOH employees' discoveries on September 5 - says the clinic has management, surgical services, staffing, and patient rights problems. 

The newspaper reported those issues are not linked explicitly to Rivers' death in the letter.

According to The Post, the letter informs Yorkville Endoscopy that if the issues at the clinic are corrected, its remunerations for the Medicare program won't be dropped.

The newspaper explained that 'CMS by law must make the full inspection report and Yorkville’s response addressing the violations public within 30 days of their being filed. That would make the inspection report public within days.'

Patient: Joan Rivers was at Yorkville Endoscopy in August for a throat procedure 

Last month, CNN quoted excerpts of a report from the New York medical examiner, which said Rivers suffered 'therapeutic complications' from the surgery.

Per the news channel, the report states 'The classification of a death as a therapeutic complication means that the death resulted from a predictable complication of medical therapy.'

It also reveals that Rivers' brain lacked oxygen and she died due to 'anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest,' CNN reported.

The report said it occurred 'during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation for evaluation of voice changes and gastroesophageal reflux disease,' according to the channel. 

A Yorkville Endoscopy spokesperson told The Post 'The Center has been working collaboratively with appropriate government regulatory agencies to ensure complete compliance with all regulations. The Center remains open and will continue to collaborate with all accreditation and government regulatory agencies to ensure quality care.'

The Post stated that lawyers from Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz for the Rivers family had not immediately answered its request for comment.

MailOnline has since reached out to both the law firm and the clinic for comment.
