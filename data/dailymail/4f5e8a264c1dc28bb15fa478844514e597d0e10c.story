Mr Navalny's brother Oleg received a three-and-a-half year jail term for fraud. 

Following his arrest, Mr Navalny managed to tweet that he 'had not got as far as the square'. 

He added: 'I call on everyone not to leave until they are forced to. They cannot arrest everyone.'   

A Russian judge today  convicted one of Vladimir Putin's most charismatic and high profile critics of fraud, but spared him jail, so stopping him from becoming a martyr.

Alexei Navalny was handed a three and a half year suspended sentence, but was left with tears in his eyes as his brother Oleg was handcuffed and jailed for the same period.

Prosecutors had demanded a lengthy jail term for the popular blogger and lawyer, an anti-corruption campaigner who wants to replace Putin as president.

In  astonishing courtroom scenes, Navalny, 38, chastised the judge over the jailing of his brother branding the proceedings a 'disgrace' before slamming his fist on the table.

He shouted at the judge: 'You are punishing me worse by taking my brother.

'What are you jailing him for, what sort of disgrace is this?'

Navalny led mass protests against  Putin
three years ago, when tens of thousands took to the streets in
Moscow and St Petersburg to protest against corruption in president's government and inner circle. 

The ruling will come as a relief for Navalny's
supporters after prosecutors asked that he be imprisoned for 10
years. 

The trial was widely seen as being political despite an insistence by the Kremlin that it does not interfere in the administration of justice in Russia.

Nevertheless, it is rare for judges to go against the demands of prosecutors so emphatically. This led to surprise today at Navalny's release, and complaints from pro-Putin elements that a 'thief' had been let off.

The Navalny brothers were accused of stealing 30 million roubles, or around $500,000 under the current exchange rate,from two firms, including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, between 2008 and 2012. 

The company involved, Yves Rocher, wrote a complaint to investigators, but its representatives have insisted throughout the trial that there never were any damages. 

The French executive who wrote the complaint also left Russia shortly afterward and never attended the hearings. 

The verdict can be seen as taking the wind out of the sails of anti-Putin groups, but the jailing of his brother appeared vindictive.

An unauthorised protest against Oleg Navalny's jailing was expected later today in Moscow.

The provocateur group Pussy Riot released a video supporting the protest, featuring women sweeping snow from the square with brooms and then mounting them and flying off as witches.

Currently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which his supporters also called a sham. 

In the 2013 trial he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow.

He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013. 

Navalny annoys leading bureaucrats because of his acerbic wit and mocking humour expressed in regular online postings. 

More than 16,000 people have said on Facebook that they would attend an unsanctioned protest called for Tuesday evening in Manezh Square adjacent to the Kremlin.
