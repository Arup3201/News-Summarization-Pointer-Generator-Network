Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans entered the witness box today and told a jury that he had not raped or sexually assaulted anyone.

The 56-year-old is alleged to have sexually assaulted seven young men on various dates between 2002 and last year by using his 'powerful' political influence to take advantage of them, often while drunk.

In his trial at Preston Crown Court he denies one rape, two indecent assaults, five sexual assaults and one attempted sexual assault.

His barrister, Peter Wright QC, asked him: 'Have you sexually assaulted anyone in terms of the allegations set out here, Mr Evans?'

The MP replied: 'No, Mr Wright.'

Mr Wright then asked: 'Have you raped anyone?'

Evans repeated: 'No, Mr Wright.'

The Swansea-born MP confirmed that he had no previous convictions and had not been arrested before these events.

Addressing the rape claim, Mr Wright said: 'The principal allegation here that you face is having raped and sexually assaulted a young man. Did you have sexual contact with him?'

The MP said: 'Yes, I did.'

The barrister continued: 'Did you engage in sexual intercourse with him?'

Evans repeated: 'Yes, I did.'

Mr Wright asked: 'Was that in the bedroom of your house?'

Evans said: 'Yes, it was in Pendleton.'

Mr Wright said: 'In terms of that activity, was it with or without his consent?'

Mr Evans told a jury that he had not raped or sexually assaulted anyone

The MP said: 'Absolutely with consent.'

Mr Wright went on: 'And in terms of your belief to his consent, was there ever any indication that he was not consenting?'

Evans replied: 'Absolutely not.'

The MP also denied to the jury that he committed two further sexual assaults against the rape complainant on the same night.Â 

Evans agreed that he did have sex with one 22-year-old man he is said to have raped.Mr Wright continued: 'Was it with or without his consent?'

Evans replied: 'Absolutely with consent.'

Mr Wright said he would begin by putting to the defendant a 'general review of the nature of the case' against him.

The prosecutor asked him about the allegation that he sexually assaulted a bisexual young man on the sofa at his house in Pendleton, Lancashire, in July 2009.

Evans accepted that he made an 'approach' and that he touched the complainant.

Mr Wright said: 'Was the touching sexual?'

Evans replied: 'It depends how you interpret that, if I may explain.

'I did get under the duvet or blanket and I did put my arm around him.

'We laid together for a while with my arm around him and his hand holding mine. When my hand started to move down, he slowly brushed it away.'

The MP said he held the young man before moving his hand down again.

Evans added: 'That's when he exploded and said "No".'

The MP said his hand got no further down than the top of the young man's belt - though the complainant has told the jury that Evans fondled his penis.

Mr Wright continued: 'Was there any further attempt to engage in sexual activity?'

Evans replied with a dismissive laugh: 'Hah! No. Not only not on that night but never again.'

Mr Wright then turned to what he called 'general matters' dealing with Evans's family background.

Evans said he was born in Swansea and educated at local schools. As soon as his head could be seen above the counter, he was involved in helping to run the family grocery shop, started by his grandfather in the 1930s - which he described as something like the store in Open All Hours.

He said all the newspapers would be in the shop, which he thought sparked his interest in current affairs and politics - and he joined the Young Conservatives at the age of 17.

He denied raping one of the men and said they had had consensual sex

Evans said: 'I always thought it was God's little joke - he made me born in Swansea and born a Tory. There's not many Tories in Swansea.'

He told the court he was unsuccessful several times in running for office as both a councillor and an MP until he was finally elected as MP for Ribble Valley in 1992.

Evans spoke of his 'co-ordinated' revelation in public via a Mail on Sunday article in December 2010 that he was gay.

He told the jury: 'I struggled with it over many years, whether I should come out or not.

'My mum was in her 80s, there was no right time. I just did not want to upset her. I didn't know how she would take it.'

But he said he now thought it would not have been a problem and was sorry he had not told her.

He continued: 'When she died on March 27 2009 that was a period for me to start to reflect when it was an appropriate time to finally come out at some stage.

'It's not that nobody knew.

'It's been referred to as an open secret in Westminster but some people knew and other people didn't know.'

Evans was later asked about the stage of his political career when he left his post as shadow secretary of state for Wales

He said that, following his decision to go public, he informed his family, members of his constituency association and Prime Minister David Cameron.

Evans was later asked about the stage of his political career when he left his post as shadow secretary of state for Wales.

The MP said: "Michael Howard (then Tory leader) decided to have a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet.

'It was much more major than that. He decided to deconstruct much of the shadow cabinet. He slimlined it and merged most of the posts.'

Mr Wright asked him: 'Were you demoted?'

Evans replied: 'I decided to return to the backbenches.

'When I knew the position was not going to remain, I was unhappy.

'I already had problems with the Welsh Assembly leader of the Conservatives there.

'I thought it was a demotion for Wales and I was not prepared to take that. Wales deserved better.

'Michael Howard offered me the job again but outside the shadow cabinet.

'I explained why I could not take it and handed in my resignation letter."

Before the 2010 general election he opted to put his name forward in the election of deputy speakers of the House of Commons.

He said: 'I thought "Here is an opportunity to be involved in the day-to-day running of Parliament on a much bigger basis".'

The subject later turned to the MP's social life.

Mr Wright asked him if there was any 'age profile' to the people he would mix with.

Evans replied: 'I would probably say not.'

He said he was just as likely to be playing dominos in his local pub with people in their 70s as mixing with those in their 20s.

Mr Wright said: 'There has been evidence that you have been drunk on occasion. Have you been drunk on occasion?'

Evans said: 'Probably.'

His barrister continued: 'On and off the parliamentary estate?'

Evans said: 'Yes.'

Mr Wright said: 'Again at Conservative Party conferences?'

The MP said: 'The party conferences are not just politics that you see on the television. They are social events. It is an opportunity for the party workers, the MPs and ministers to meet.

'Therefore, there is absolutely nothing peculiar to people drinking at party conferences.

'It is not just the Conservatives. It is all party conferences.'
