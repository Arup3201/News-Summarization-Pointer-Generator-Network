The media magnate Alexander Lebedev yesterday protested his innocence over a charge of hooliganism motivated by ‘political hatred’ as a Russian judge lifted a travel ban allowing him to fly to Britain.

The businessman, whose family own the Independent and the London Evening Standard, faces up to five years in jail in a case that raises acute concerns over state interference in newspaper freedoms.

Mr Lebedev, 53, travels to London today insisting that he will not follow dozens of President Vladimir Putin’s wealthy enemies and seek asylum in Britain.

Instead, he will obey a court order 
to return to Russia by next Wednesday, even though he expects to be 
imprisoned in a case that is widely seen as revenge by officials loyal 
to the Kremlin strongman.

Ostensibly, Mr Lebedev is on trial 
for punching businessman Sergei Polonsky during a TV talk show in 2011, 
but analysts and diplomats believe that the prosecution is  vengeance 
for the relentless anti-corruption exposés of Novaya Gazeta, the 
newspaper he owns with the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

Its editor, Dmitry Muratov, warned: ‘They are trying to finish off Lebedev before our eyes.’

A Western diplomat monitoring the 
case said: ‘With the bulk of the Russian media already cowed, this shows
what happens when newspapers and television have no independence from 
state control.’

Mr Lebedev accepts he struck Mr 
Polonsky, but denies any political malice and claims he acted in 
self-defence, fearing that the businessman, a former paratrooper, was 
about to attack him.

Footage of the punch, which knocked 
Mr Polonsky backwards off the TV stage in his chair, went viral on the 
internet, and Mr Putin swiftly described his behaviour as ‘hooliganism’.

Before yesterday’s hearing in Moscow,
Mr Lebedev said the case was Mr Putin’s revenge for his criticism of 
the government and a warning to other rich Russian businessmen known as 
oligarchs.

‘It’s the government that’s against me,’ Mr Lebedev said.

On a trip to London and Italy, he 
will attend the 33rd birthday party of his son, Evgeny, now in charge of
the family’s British newspapers, who has expressed fears for his 
father’s life if he is jailed.

After yesterday’s short court 
hearing, Mr Lebedev, who also owns a bank in Moscow, said: ‘I don’t 
understand the accusation. It is made up from the first to the last 
word.’ Vowing to declare his innocence in court at the next hearing, he 
said: ‘It’s simple – I don’t accept the guilt.’

He admitted that he might have 
‘overestimated the threat’ of Mr Polonsky hitting him, but claimed: ‘I 
definitely did not cause anyone any damage, did not commit any act of 
hooliganism and did not show any political hatred.’

Judge Andrei Bakhvalov relaxed the 
travel ban despite strong objections from prosecutors, but warned the 
billionaire of ‘serious measures’ if he absconded. The judge yesterday 
delayed the case until May 20 after Mr Polonsky and his lawyer failed to
attend, as did a string of witnesses whose testimony Mr Lebedev alleges
has been fabricated to buttress the case against him.

He mentioned a woman who supposedly 
complained to police about the punch after allegedly watching it on TV –
but only on the day after she turned 18, the minimum age for a witness.
She has been accepted by the state as a key witness, he said.

He claimed other basic errors have also been made in the investigation.

In another development, Mr Lebedev 
yesterday drew attention to reports that Mr Polonsky may have skipped 
bail in Cambodia – where he is under a court order not to leave the 
country over accusations of kidnapping and assaulting a group of boatmen
– to travel to Europe.

Mr Polonsky is believed to have been 
in Switzerland and Luxembourg in recent days, amid speculation that he 
could give evidence in person against Mr Lebedev.

The tycoon called on Cambodia to issue an international arrest warrant for Mr Polonsky.
