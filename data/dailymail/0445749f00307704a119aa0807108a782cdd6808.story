Lavish party: Actor Matt Damon used the alias 'Mr Naff' to book out an entire Caribbean resort for a part to celebrate the renewal of his wedding vows with wife Luciana Barroso, left

Hollywood star Matt Damon has grown accustomed to using aliases playing Jason Bourne – the renegade agent travels the world using a series of false names

But Damon appears to have had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he chose his own alias to book a lavish party for a renewal of his wedding vows.

The 42-year-old star has rented out the entire Sugar Beach resort on the Caribbean island of  St Lucia under the name ‘Mr Naff’.

Damon and his wife Luciana Barroso, 37, have spent £300,000 on the party – a week-long celebration with guests expected to include George Clooney, Brad Pitt and his fiancee Angelina Jolie, and his latest co-star, Michael Douglas and his Oscar-winning wife Catherine Zeta-Jones.

A staff member at Sugar beach said: ‘The hotel was booked under a different name to Damon.

'We were told that it was a Mr and Mrs Naff getting married.

‘We then heard that it was Matt Damon and they had been using a false name to stop their secret being found out.

‘He was here two months ago to have a look around. A big yacht moored by the beach and he came into the resort.’

According to sources, all 78 rooms at the five-star hotel, which was opened 21 years ago by the late Princess Margaret’s close friend Lord Glenconner, and has more recently played host to guests including actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her husband, Coldplay singer Chris Martin, have been booked for a week from April 8 for the event.

Damon and Barroso, who have three children together and a fourth from Miss Barroso’s previous relationship, married in a low-key ceremony at New York’s City Hall in 2005 but were unable to celebrate with a honeymoon due to filming commitments.

A spokesman for Sugar Beach said:  ‘We never comment  on our guests.’
