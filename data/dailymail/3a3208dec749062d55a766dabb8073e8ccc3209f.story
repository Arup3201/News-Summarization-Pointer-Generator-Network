Juggling work and the school run can be hard enough, let alone  having to think about what to cook  for dinner.

So one woman decided to ease the burden for busy mums – and turned her kitchen into a takeaway serving home-cooked meals.

Every week day Kara Dexter whips up wholesome cottage pies, lasagnes and pasta bakes for families in her town using local ingredients.

Freshly made: Kara Dexter in her kitchen. She began cooking more fresh meals after her eight-year-old daughter had to take time off school due to an illness

Asian flavours: (Clockwise from bottom right) Fishcakes and chicken satay, green chicken curry, Thai rice, red pork and red pepper curry and prawn crackers

Customer favourite: Mrs Dexter's chicken, chorizo and red pepper pie. She said: 'Tuesday pie night has proved to be popular and people get really excited about it'

With as many as 20 orders to prepare in a
 day, she has to get up as early as 5.30am so everything is ready for 
collection during the afternoon school run.

Mrs Dexter, 42, charges 
£8 for a meal for one, £13 for two, £18 for four or £23 for six, and has
 recently started a children’s menu with prices starting from £3 per 
portion.

‘At first I thought it might be a service where busy people 
might be interested in having one night off a week worrying about what 
to cook and having to shop for ingredients,’ she said.

‘Then it just
 took off. It seems to  have really captured the imagination of people, 
especially the mothers in the school playgrounds.

Family time: Kara cooks with her daughter Katie. The mother-of-two now has up to 77 customers a week who pay between £8 and £23 for a meal

Comfort food: Kara's chicken, chorizo and red pepper casserole. Customers have to order by 9am the day before, but Mrs Dexter said 'emergency meals' are sometimes available

Ingredients: Fresh fruit and vegetable play a big part in Mrs Dexter's menu. She buys all the meat she uses from a local butcher and the vegetables come from the local market

‘Some customers 
are families who want to spend more time with their children, but I also
 have some elderly couples and young professionals who need a meal at 
short notice.

‘The only downside is sometimes I’ve sold our own meals some nights so we’ve ended up with beans on toast.’

Mrs
 Dexter used to rely on takeaways and eating out when she worked in 
nursing, while her husband Mark, 45, is just as busy in his job as a 
company director.

Then last year their daughter Katie, eight, had to 
take time off school due to ill health, so she began cooking more at 
home for her and son Harry, six.

After friends asked her for a 
couple of meals a week she had the idea for her business, Kara’s 
Kitchen, which is now her full-time job.

Her customers in Knutsford, 
Cheshire, have to order by 9am the previous day, although Mrs Dexter, 
who has a food safety certificate and is registered with the local 
authorities, makes some meals at short notice for regulars.

She even 
makes dairy and nut-free dinners for children with allergies, as well as
 Indian or Thai feasts for families looking for an alternative to 
takeaways.

Sweet tooth: Mrs Dexter's chocolate sponge cake with a coffee buttercream filling, just one of the delicious meals she spends nine hours a day preparing for her customers

Brains behind the business: The mother-of-two began cooking more at home when her daughter had to take time off school. When she hosted dinner parties, family and friends would comment on her culinary talents

World cuisine: As well as traditional English food like fish fingers, Mrs Dexter's daily offerings include Indian curries, served with naan bread (left) and coq au vin (right) - a French favourite

It is all served on her own crockery, which customers wash 
and return.

Some of Mrs Dexter’s 77 clients have posted dozens of 
thank you messages on her Facebook page.

Judith Plant wrote: ‘Thank you,
 your meal made my usual stressful Monday evening much easier and I 
appeared to be a kitchen goddess!’

Penny Sproston said: ‘I had been 
out since 8.30am this morning and to come home to this at 5pm and have a
 lovely home-cooked meal ready for my family was perfect.’

Filling: Smoked haddock gratin is just one of the delicious meals on the menu. Mrs Dexter said that she has now bought new kitchen equipment and is getting better at buying the right quantity of food

Balanced meal: Customers can tuck into chicken kiev, layered potatoes and broccoli. Before she started Kara's Kitchen, Mrs Dexter said her family relied on ready meals and takeaways

Made to order: Risotto with a parmesan crust (left) and tomato and basil soup (right). Customers can request the size of the meal they would like - whether it is a meal for one, or enough to feed a family
