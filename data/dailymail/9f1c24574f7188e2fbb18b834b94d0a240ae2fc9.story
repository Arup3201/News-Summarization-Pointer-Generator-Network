A Russian acrobat gave new meaning to the word dare devil by setting himself on fire and plunging nine floors onto nothing but a pile of snow.

Alexander Chernikov attached a camera to himself to record the daring leap, but the stunt went far from planned.

Not only was he later hospitalised with burns, but Mr Chernikov was also arrested.

The stunt man's team had strategically heaped a large pile of snow on the ground to cushion his fall and to smother the flames. 

Footage of the stunt shows Mr Chernikov standing on the roof of a building in the town of Novoaltaysk, in Altai Krai.
