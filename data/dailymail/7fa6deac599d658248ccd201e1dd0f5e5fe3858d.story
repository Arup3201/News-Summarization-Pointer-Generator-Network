New York City Mayor Elect Bill de Blasio's 19-year-old daughter posted a deeply personal YouTube video on Christmas Eve in which she details her struggle with drugs, alcohol and mental health issues.

In the surprise confessional video, Chiara de Blasio claims she's struggled with depression and anxiety most of her life and that she turned to substances in order to cope.

'It made it easier the more I drank and did drugs,' said the Santa Clara University sophomore.

In a surprise confessional video posted to YouTube Christmas Eve, the daughter of NYC mayor elect Bill de Blasio confesses to her history of drug and alcohol abuse and depression

Kicked the habit: Chiara says she smoked weed and drank in order to help her with her depression and anxiety in social situations. She says she's since kicked the habits thanks to a treatment program

The revelation comes just a few days before her father is sworn into office January 1, an office Chiara actually helped him win as she campaigned often with her family.

'Removing substances from my life has opened so many doors for me,' Chiara says in the video, her face alight with a big smile. 'I was actually able to participate in my dad's campaign and that was, like, the greatest thing ever.'

But, she says, it was a difficult road getting to that point.

'Getting sober is always a positive thing,' Chiara says, but 'it's the hardest thing I've ever done.'

Success: Chiara is now clean and sober, she says, and the change has allowed her to work with her father on his successful bid to become New York's first democratic mayor in 20 years

Chiara says it was her therapist who 
first referred her to a treatment program, but that her family tried 
hard to help even before that.

'My mom was trying really hard to help me, my dad was doing the same,' she says.

'As
 parents, our instinct has been to protect our daughter and privately 
help her through a deeply personal struggle,' Bill de Blasio and his 
wife Chirlane said in a statement.

'But
 not only has Chiara committed to her own health, she is also committed 
to helping young people everywhere who face similar challenges.

Strategic? Chiara, center, became a key part of the de Blasio campaign after it made the candidate's family (and hairdos) a key part of their strategy

'Her courage to speak out demonstrates a wisdom and maturity far beyond her 19 years,' reads a statement from de Blasio (center) and wife Chirlane, 'and we are grateful every day for her commitment to lifting up those who need to know that they are not alone'

'Her
 courage to speak out demonstrates a wisdom and maturity far beyond her 
19 years, and we are grateful every day for her commitment to lifting up
 those who need to know that they are not alone. We are so proud of 
Chiara and love her deeply.'

More than just an airing of her laundry, Chiara reaches out in the video to others who might be going through the same thing she has through a website called ok2talk.org.

'Nobody can do sobriety on their own,' she says. 'You have to rely on those who've been there.'

If you're 'honest, open and willing,' the politician's daughter says, 'you will see the most immense change you've ever seen.'

'We are so proud of Chiara and love her deeply,' said de Blasio, who will be sworn in as New York City's mayor on January 1
