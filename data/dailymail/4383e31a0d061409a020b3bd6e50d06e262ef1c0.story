'Shaman': Juliette D'Souza persuaded a woman to have an abortion by claiming the unborn child was evil and seriously deformed, a fraud trial has heard

A witch doctor persuaded a woman to have an abortion by claiming the unborn child was evil and seriously deformed, a fraud trial has heard.

Juliette D’Souza pretended to be a shaman who could cure terminal illnesses and help women conceive babies, it was said.

The phoney faith healer tricked the woman into parting with £170,000 after she became increasingly desperate to fall pregnant, the jury was told.

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Blackfriars Crown Court in London yesterday that she had been unable to conceive for three years.

She was introduced to D’Souza in 2005. The witch doctor told the woman she had to start paying money to her to stop ‘terrible things’ from happening and to help her become pregnant.

But when the woman unexpectedly became pregnant, D’Souza allegedly told her to have an abortion at a Marie Stopes Clinic because ‘the baby was evil’ and ‘he would be in real trouble’ if she gave birth.

Breaking down in tears in the witness box, the woman said: ‘She told me that the baby was very deformed, ill and sick. She said that I should get rid of the baby.

‘I flew on the day it was terminated. I asked to be at the back of the plane because I just cried the whole way. I was in so much pain. It was just so awful, the whole thing.’

She said D’Souza, 59, was the ‘cruellest and most evil person’ she had ever met.

Asked why she gave her so much money, the woman said: ‘Because I wanted to be a mother and I thought maybe this would change my whole life situation because it was not very good.’

By the autumn of 2007 she began to suspect D’Souza’s act was a scam and told officers at Hampstead Police Station in North-West London. But officers ‘practically laughed in our faces’, she said.

Eventually she broke into one of D’Souza’s rented properties in Hampstead and discovered a treasure trove of ‘voodoo black magic’ items, the court heard.

These included drawings of an ‘evil eye’, burned photographs half buried in earth, seven freezers filled with rotting meat and a monkey in a cage on the first floor, it was alleged.

D’Souza is accused of persuading 11 people to part with cash ‘sacrifices’ of £30,000 or £40,000 at a time.

They believed the money was flown to Suriname in South America where it would be hung from a magical tree in the Amazon rainforest where it would solve whatever problems they faced. Instead, the money was allegedly used to fund a ‘lavish lifestyle’.  

D’Souza denies 23 charges of obtaining property by deception and fraud. The trial continues.
