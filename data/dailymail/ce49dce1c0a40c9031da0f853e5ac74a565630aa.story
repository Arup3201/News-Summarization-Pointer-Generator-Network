Australian music legend Richard Clapton has compared himself to Rolling Stone's rocker Keith Richards, but said his 40-year career was not all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.

'People only talk about the negative aspects of drug taking,' the singer-songwriter and producer told Daily Mail Australia. 'That drug culture did fuel so much creativity in the '70s and '80s.'

'I'm not a drug advocate and I don't condone it... (but) I don't express regret for how I lived or how my friends lived.

'I'm Australia's Keith Richard, but you'll need a medical expert to explain it.'

Australian rocker Richard Clapton has reflected on his 40-year career in his autobiography, but said readers will need to fill in some of the blanks

Clapton was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1999 and has produced a number of solo hits and albums. He is pictured left at the Rockin' For Rights concert at Sydney Cricket Ground in 2007 and right at the Albert Memorial in London in 1968 

Reflecting on his once 'decadent lifestyle', Clapton, who declined to reveal his age, said while weed and alcohol were his vices, he does not use any drugs now.

'Acid was big back then, but not in my case,' he said.

'It's a very conservative world we live in now - my period was the hippie period. A lot of the things people find shocking these days were normal 30 or 40 years ago,' he said.

Born in Sydney, Clapton is most remembered for solo hits including Girls on the Avenue in 1975 and I Am an Island in 1982 and also as a member of The Party Boys.

He has just released his touted tell-all autobiography The Best Years of Our Lives, but admits he has been coy about some details of his past, leaving readers to 'fill in the blanks'.

'My book could have been different,' he said. 'I'm keeping it gritty without the specifics... all my generation know exactly what was going on.'

'They can fill in the blanks without losing the essence of the story.

'I could have made stronger comments 30 to 40 years ago if I was writing the book then because that hippie drug culture was the norm.'

However the rocker said he believed the world would see a new wave of 'hippie culture' in the future because 'life is cyclical'.

Clapton has 24-year-old twin daughters and said their lives are vastly different from his own, although one is currently in a retro band.

'My daughters have shown no interest in that sort of culture - they don't even drink let alone do drugs,' he said.

When asked how he would feel if his daughters took drugs, Clapton said it was not a quandary that affected him.

'Modern drugs are a worry, because they're man-made,' he said. 'If my daughters had shown any interest in that lifestyle I'm not even sure how I would react - I'd educate them the best I can.

'They've leap frogged over me. They aren't interested in the lifestyle I lived.'

Clapton said today's drug and drinking culture was vastly different from what he experienced in the '70s and '80s.

'Hippies and generation X were able to drink so much and not attract so much negativity,' he said.

'In the '70s and '80s, bands like mine would play four to five nights a week. Fans would come three or four times a week and work at 9am, that's why it was called pub rock.

'Nowadays I don't know why there's so much bizarre drunkenness - people aren't happy drunks.'

During his career, the 1999 ARIA Hall of Fame inductee said a highlight was working with INXS. 'For me it was life changing,' he said. 

'The first time I saw them, they were playing a gig to nobody in Paddington. Their attitude was amazing,' he said. 'They had amazing work ethic.'

'About 13 years later I saw them playing to 25,000 people in Paris - every gig was killer, they were all killer and no filler.

After meeting INXS, Clapton forged a 33-year friendship with Jon Farriss, pictured together right, and said he was devastated when 'good mate' Michael Hutchence died

Clapton produced one of the group's first big hits, The Loved One, in 1981 and went on to start producing their second album Underneath the Colours that same year.

'The important thing to remember, INXS and most of the musicians I know who were part of that culture were extremely prolific - a lot of killer songs came out of the '70s and '80s,' he said.

'It wasn't a matter of us just sitting around starring at our feet - drugs were on the periphery but weren't the driving force. First was always music.'

Becoming 'good mates' with members including Michael Hutchence and Jon Farriss, Clapton said he was devastated at the loss of the group's lead singer - one of the biggest losses and lows he has experienced in his 40-year career.

'I thought Michael was amazing - the most special human I ever met. It was a loss for humanity,' he said.

'Because his death was so unexpected it exacerbated the impact - I was shattered.'

Clapton said Farriss, who he shares a 33-year friendship with, has produced and played on some of his albums.

During his career, Clapton has worked and forged strong friendships with members of Cold Chisel including Ian Moss and Jimmy Barnes (pictured together from left)

Clapton has also worked with Cold Chisel and its members throughout his career. 'Ian Moss has played on most (my) albums in the last 30 years, and Jimmy (Barnes) has been on quite a bit too.

Despite his own success, Clapton said he would not advise people to get into the music business today and even advised one of his daughters not to join a band.

'The music world is entirely different today. It's based on a whole knew sort of attitude to music,' he said.

Clapton said music was a 'pure art' in his day and not about the money. 'It was frowned upon if you said you wanted to be a pop or rock star. It was all about the musicianmanship,' he said.

'It was pretty tough when I was getting into it (music) but now it's impossibly tough. Young people have brief success - you blink and it's gone.'

'I didn't want to be a pop star, but my album Goodbye Tiger (released in 1977) put me on the map as an entity and now I have a cult audience who are still with me today.'

The rocker said he has no regrets and his life was full of love thanks to his twin daughters

With no intention of becoming a rock star, Clapton said his initial plan was just to be a songwriter. 'I've grown to love performing,' he said.

'I can tell you what a great ride this has been but until I've painted my masterpiece I will keep on going and I don't think I've painted it yet.'

Despite 40 years in the business, Clapton said he had no regrets. 'I've got two beautiful daughters and there is a lot of love in the room,' he said.

'What I try and instil in my daughters is do something with their lives. That's really the key to longevity. Take on new challenges.

'Songwriting is the best vocation you can have. I'm never going to be resting on my laurels or say: "I've written some great songs so I don't have to try anymore".'

'It's very cathartic - get out of the f*****g gym and write if you want to be happy for the rest of your life.'

Richard Clapton's autobiography The Best Years of Our Lives is out now and is available for $32.99.
