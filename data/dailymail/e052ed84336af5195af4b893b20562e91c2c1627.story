Mock up: What the Prime Minister may look like in his pyjamas

For a Prime Minister who has previously been accused of having a penchant for ‘chillaxing’ on the job, it is a mental image that could go both ways.

David Cameron has admitted to working in his pyjamas – because he gets up so early.

The Prime Minister said he begins work in Number 10 early each morning before changing into one of his smart work suits he is usually seen in.

Appearing on the BBC to answer questions sent in from around the world, Mr Cameron was asked if he found it difficult living and working in the same place.

One viewer from Turkey asked: ‘Do you sometimes have to do work as Prime Minister in your pyjamas?’

Mr Cameron told the World Have Your Say programme: ‘I get up pretty early in the morning and I start work before I get dressed into all of this [my suit]. So I suppose the short answer to that is, yes.’

The admission is likely to reinforce Mr Cameron’s reputation for informality but counter criticism that he does not work long enough hours.

The Prime Minister has previously been accused of taking too much time off to ‘chillax’ – a term coined for ‘relaxing’ and ‘chilling out’–  when he is meant to be running the country.

Reputation: David Cameron, watching football with Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, reputedly likes to 'chillax' regularly

He has disclosed he likes to go to bed early, as well as running and play tennis at least once a week.

A Number 10 source also told the Spectator last year that the Prime Minister spent a ‘scary, crazy amount of time playing Fruit Ninja on his iPad’, a computer game.

However, Mr Cameron has always insisted that he works ‘incredibly hard’.
