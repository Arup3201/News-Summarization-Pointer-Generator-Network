Beloved ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's newest flavor is as fantastically 'over the top' as the funny man who inspired it. 

To celebrate Jimmy Fallon's first full season as the host of The Tonight Show, the brand has debuted The Tonight Dough, a decadent ice cream that 'combines chocolate and caramel ice creams with chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough and a crunchy chocolate cookie swirl'. 

In order to see if the bold new flavor really was 'chock full of the stuff people love', the Femail team put Ben & Jerry's newest ice cream to the test at our New York City headquarters.

Over the top: The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy Fallon 'combines chocolate and caramel ice creams with chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough and a crunchy chocolate cookie swirl'

Big reveal: Ben & Jerry's co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield joined Jimmy on his show earlier this week to help debut their new flavor, which celebrates the comedian's first full season of The Tonight Show

'Quite sickly, but really tasty,' said US Femail assistant editor Charlie Lankston. 'I liked that I could taste a different variety of flavors, from chocolate to peanut butter.

She added: 'But I felt that it could have done with a few more cookie dough pieces.'

Daily Mail Online's Senior Associate Photo Editor Kaitlinn Van Ert agreed that the the two varieties of cookie dough bites made the ice cream even more appealing. 

'The mix in textures is really nice and it’s a good balance in flavors,' she said. '[You] can never go wrong with cookie dough.'

US Assistant Science and Technology Editor Ellie Zolfagharifard rated the flavor seven out of ten because she thought it was lacking when it came to another of its ingredients.  

Number one fan: 'This ice cream is the greatest,' Jimmy told his audience as he enjoyed a sample with the company's founders 

'I think it needs more chocolate,' she explained. 'But otherwise very tasty.'

Jimmy unveiled the new flavor on his show earlier this week, explaining that when he was hosting Late Night With Jimmy Fallon in 2011, Ben & Jerry's had created its first flavor in his honor - Late Night Snack.

Sadly the vanilla bean ice cream, which contained salty caramel swirls and fudge covered potato chip clusters, has since been discontinued, but Jimmy noted that he was ready for a bigger and better flavor anyway. 

'This isn't Late Night anymore. This is the Tonight Show,' he said. 'This is the big leagues. We have to raise the bar. We have to up our game, and that is exactly what we did.'

Charity work: Jimmy also revealed that all the proceeds from Tonight Dough will go to SeriousFun Children’s Network, a non-profit organization that funds camps and programs for children with serious illnesses

Fun game: After debuting the new flavor, Jimmy hid inside an ice cream feeding machine at the Ben & Jerry's shop at New York City's Rockefeller Center in order to trick customers who were sampling The Tonight Dough

Although Jimmy said they 'tried thousands' of flavor combinations', he never specifically explained how they landed on the ice cream's key ingredients.

Ben & Jerry's co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield joined Jimmy on his show to help debut their new ice cream, and after a dramatic drum roll, the late night host excitedly uncovered a giant tub of The Tonight Dough.

'Guys, this ice cream is the greatest. It is the best tasting ice cream - I swear - you will ever have in your life.'

Jimmy also revealed that all the proceeds from Tonight Dough will go to SeriousFun Children’s Network, a non-profit organization that funds camps and programs for children with serious illnesses. 

But the host didn't stop there.

The next day he visited the Ben & Jerry's shop at New York City's Rockefeller Center, where he hid inside a 'state-of-the-art ice cream feeding machine' to hand out samples of The Tonight Dough and play a few trick on his fans.   

Great Surprise: Fans were thrilled to learn that the bizarre ice cream feeding machine was actually being run by the Tonight Show host
