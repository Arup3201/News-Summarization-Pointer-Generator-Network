Comeback: Agnetha Faltskog pictured in her heyday when she sang with Abba

It has been 30 years since she turned her back on the glitz and glamour of the music world.

But now Abba’s golden girl Agnetha Faltskog, is ready to launch a long-awaited comeback at the age of 62 – alongside Gary Barlow.

Miss Faltskog has proved to be the band’s most elusive member and has largely shunned the limelight since the four went their separate ways in 1982.

She pursued a solo career for a few years after the split but has since lived quietly on the secluded island of Ekero, west of Stockholm.

The singer has said that she wasn’t even sure her voice still ‘worked’, as it had been so long since she had last sung.

But two years ago she was approached by Swedish producer Jorgen Elofsson, who also penned Britney Spears’ Crazy and Kelly Clarkson’s Stronger, who asked if he could play her some songs he wanted to record.

She says she found his approach ‘flattering’ but had reservations about stepping back into the studio after so many years.

‘It was flattering, it really was, ‘ she said. ‘I couldn’t say no. I really loved the songs from the beginning. But I told him “we have to talk about a lot of things first”.

‘It was nine or ten years since I’d sung so I didn’t know if I [my voice] worked.’ 

The new project will see her duet with Take That star Barlow on the song When You Really Loved Someone, the first track to be released from her new album ‘A’ – her first in a decade – which is out later this year.

Abba burst on to the world stage in 1974 when they won the Eurovision song contest in Brighton with Waterloo. 

They went on to sell 350million records, and their greatest hits compilation album, Abba Gold, stayed in the charts for more than 400 weeks. Miss Faltskog was married to bandmate Bjorn Ulvaeus after first meeting him at a cafe when she was 19.

They wed in 1971 and had two children before they divorced at the height of Abba’s fame.

Bjorn, 67, now owns several stage and music companies, and has made millions alongside band mate Benny Andersson, 66, thanks to the success of Mamma Mia.  

Abba’s fourth member, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, 67, now lives in Switzerland as the Countess of Plauen  following her marriage to Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss of Plauen.  

Miss Faltskog says she still looks back fondly on the Abba years but has donated all her costumes and memorabilia to the Abba Museum and does not believe that she and her former band members will ever perform together again. 

She said: ‘It was such a long time ago and we are getting older and we have our different lives.’
