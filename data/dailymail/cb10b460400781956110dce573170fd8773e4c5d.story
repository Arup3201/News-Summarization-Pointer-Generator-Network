MailSport have been nominated for the coveted Team of the Year prize at the 2014 Press Awards.

It has been another superb year for all three platforms with the stars of sports journalism showcased all day, every day.

In addition, Lawton also covered how England batsman Jonathan Trott had to put his cricket career on hold following more anxiety attacks.
