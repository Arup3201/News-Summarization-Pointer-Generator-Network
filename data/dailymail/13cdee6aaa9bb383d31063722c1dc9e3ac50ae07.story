The U.S. government has revealed details of serious allegations against Secret Service agents and officers going back to 2004, among them claims of involvement with prostitutes, leaking sensitive information, publishing pornography, sexual assault, illegal wiretaps, improper use of weapons and drunkenness.

The heavily censored 229-page document was released with little fanfare under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act on the heels of the embarrassing Secret Service prostitution scandal that erupted in April in Colombia. 

It describes accusations filed against Secret Service agents with the Homeland Security Department's inspector general.

Bad history: The allegations against Secret Service agents detailed in the document go back to 2004

Some of the accusations occurred as recently as last month. In many cases, the government noted that some of the claims were resolved administratively, and others were being formally investigated.

The new disclosures of so many serious accusations lend weight to concerns expressed by Congress that the prostitution scandal exposed a culture of misconduct within the agency charged with protecting the U.S. president and other top officials.

Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan apologized for the incident during a hearing in May but insisted that what happened in Colombia was an isolated case.

Secret Service officials did not immediately respond Friday to questions about the accusations.

The complaints included an alleged sexual assault reported in August of 2011. In the heavily redacted entry, an agent was accused of pushing a female co-worker onto a bed during a work trip.

—October 2011: An employee was accused of sending harassing messages to a woman who interpreted them to be sexual harassment.

—March
2011: A complaint was filed involving embezzlement or theft of public 
money. Nearly the entire entry was censored save for a notation that it 
was adjudicated by a judge.

—October 2010: An employee was 
implicated in a national security leak. The details were censored, and 
the records didn't include a disposition of the case.

—May 2012: 
An employee was accused of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 
No details were provided, other than that the case was closed 
administratively.

—May 2012: An officer was videotaped, twice, wandering nude around an apartment complex.

—January
2011: Police in New York arrested an investigative support assistant on
charges sexual abuse. The records do not list an outcome for the case.

—2005:
An armed agent was accused of threatening to shut down a strip club 
because it was charging $40 for lap dances and $25 for table-side 
dances, which the agent said was against federal law. The incident was 
reported in May 2012.

The employee ‘got on top of (censored) attempting to have sex,’ even though the woman ‘told (censored) 'no' several times.’ The entry noted that supervisors described the accused as ‘a conscientious and dependable employee.’ The incident was closed with an ‘administrative disposition’ in February.

They also included an anonymous complaint in October of 2003 that a Secret Service agent ‘may have been involved with a prostitution ring,’ noting that two telephone numbers belonging to the unnamed agent, who has since retired, turned up as part of an FBI investigation into a prostitution ring.

In addition, in 2005, an employee was reported to the Washington field office for being arrested on a charge of solicitation in a park. Documents do not reveal the outcome of that case.In 2008, an on-duty uniform division officer was arrested in a Washington prostitution sting. The officer, who was driving a marked Secret Service vehicle at the time, was placed on administrative leave, according to the released records.

Sullivan said during the May hearing that the officer was later fired.

Some of the allegations were obviously false, such as a complaint in August of 2010 that a Secret Service agent had performed experiments and implanted stimulators in a citizen's brain.

The list also included dozens of complaints about fraudulent emails that circulate widely on the Internet and appear to come from the Secret Service.

Escort: Huntington's fight with Dania Suarez sparked a major scandal and an internal investigation

A dozen Secret Service officers, 
agents and supervisors were implicated in the Colombia scandal and eight
have been forced out of the agency. At least two employees are fighting
to get their jobs back.

The scandal that shed light on an 
apparent culture of permissiveness within the Secret Service broke in 
mid-April when a high-priced Colombian call girl known then only as 
‘Dania’ went public with allegations that a Secret Service that hired 
her for sex refused to pay her $800 for her services.

What followed next was a series of embarrassing and explosive revelations the cost several agents their jobs.

Secret Service supervisor David Chaney
was forced to retire over his alleged role in the incident, his 
colleague while Greg Stokes was 'removed with cause.’

Taking care of business: Suarez said that she is now willing to sell her story

Proposal: Dania Suarez said she and one of the agents agreed he would pay her $800 for sex at the hotel

Another agent resigned after being suspended as part of the investigation into the scandal.

Speaking about the tawdry episode that has seen three agents ousted from their posts after a wild night of partying in Cartagena, 24-year-old prostitute Dania Suarez. claimed she was offered $30 - a fraction of her $800 fee - for a night with one of the men, identified later as Arthur Huntington, that she met at the discotheque Pleyclub.

In an interview in Colombia, Suarez, a single mother of a nine-year-old boy, she said two agents argued over the price, ending with Colombian law enforcement involved. She said she was eventually paid about $225.

She described the men as 'completely stupid' and that she didn't know how they had come to be a part of Obama's security team.

Huntington left the agency in May, but the circumstances of his departure are unclear.

Eleven Secret Service agents were eventually sent home from the colonial-era city of Cartagena on Colombia's Caribbean coast after a wild night of partying that saw many of the agents bring escorts back to their rooms, according to reports.

The agents were in town in advance of President Barack Obama's arrival for the Summit of the Americas. The incident occurred before Obama arrived and was at a different hotel than the president stayed in.
