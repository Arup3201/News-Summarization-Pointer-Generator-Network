This black bear in Canada decided he was more of a back-seat driver when he was filmed trying out the seats of a family's car.

The Moore family, from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, had been woken by a banging outside in the early hours of Tuesday.

When they looked out the window they saw a black bear climb out of the driver's seat of their pick up truck, before opening the door to the back seat.

Driving seat: The black bear was spotted climbing out the front of the pick up truck at about 5.30am

'We saw him just open the door of the truck, just easy as anything... He was obviously used to accessing vehicles,' Rebecca Moore said.

The mother said they have a lot of wildlife around their home, and usually make loud noises to scare any bears away.

However, the amusing behavior of the three-year-old animal meant she reached for her camera phone first.

'It was just the amazement, really. You 
just couldn't believe what you were seeing,' she told CBC News.

'[The bear] was actually inside one of our cars. We saw the car door open and it was just coming out one of our cars.'

After the bear had tried out both of the couple's cars, and Mrs Moore had finished filming, her husband chased the bear away.

No food had been stored in the cars 
and Mrs Moore said the only tell-tale sign that a bear had been near 
them was a paw print on the windshield.

Conservation
officers suspect that the animal was a three-year-old bear who has been
breaking into other cars in the area, including a Porsche.

'Bears will just go, "What is this?",' conservation officer Denny Chretien said. 'They'll give it a test and there's so much things to grip on to in a vehicle and they just start ripping.'

The family's neighbor, Cathy Bennett Head, believes the bear could be the culprit who broke into her car recently.

She told The Province it was clear from the video that this was not the animal's first break-in.

The bear's antics have become a YouTube hit. Since uploading the footage under the caption 'Bearjacked' Mrs Moore's video has attracted more than 148,000 views.
