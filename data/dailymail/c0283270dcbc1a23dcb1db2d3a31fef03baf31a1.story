High Street fashion chain Zara is under investigation over the use of sweatshops and child labour, it was revealed last night.

‘Degrading’ factory conditions in Argentina were reportedly used to produce clothes for the store that boasts the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron among its fans.

Mostly Bolivian labourers, including children, were made to work up to 16-hour days without breaks and were prevented from leaving the factories without permission, according to investigators.

Scrutiny: High-street fashion store Zara is under investigation over the use of slave labour at factories in Argentina, it was reported today

Authorities moved in on the sweatshops
 on the outskirts of Buenos Aires after a tip-off from a workers’ rights
 charity. Gustavo Vera, a spokesman for the charity La Alameda, said 
people were made to start at 7am and work without a break until as late 
as 11pm, from Monday to Saturday.

He said: ‘Their workplaces were also 
their homes, families were forced to share cramped quarters in a mess of
 sewing machines, needles, threads and children. The places were dark 
without proper lighting to sew and no ventilation.’

Royal seal of approval: Zara is a favourite with the Middleton sisters- both were seen wearing the brand the morning after the royal wedding in April 2011 with Kate wearing a Zara dress and Pippa wearing a Zara blazer

Zara has seen profits soar over the 
past three years – no doubt aided by the ‘Kate effect’ as the Duchess is
 regularly spotted wearing their garments.

Her sister Pippa is also a 
fan as are Mary Berry, Tess Daley and Mrs Cameron. The Spanish-owned 
retailer has 1,540 stores worldwide including 64 in the UK.

The publicity-shy founder and 
majority-owner of Inditex, the company that owns Zara, is 77-year-old 
Amancio Ortega. He is the world’s third richest man with a fortune of 
£38billion, according to Forbes.

Among the items being sewn at one 
clandestine workshop in Buenos Aires, according to the Argentinian 
authorities, were pieces from the Zara Man fashion line, which are sold 
in British stores.

Juan Gomez Centurion, head of 
Argentina’s Government Control Agency which raided three factories 
producing Zara clothes last week, said: ‘We found men and children who 
lived in the place where they worked. They were not registered and they 
were living in terrible conditions.

They had no official documents and 
were held against their will, they were not allowed to leave their 
workplaces without permission.’

This is the second time Zara has been accused of involvement in slave and child labour in South America.

In 2011 a group of workers – 14 
Bolivians and one Peruvian – were rescued from an unlicensed factory in 
Sao Paulo, Brazil, where clothes carrying the Zara label were being 
produced.

The immigrant workers, one of whom was
 reported to be just 14, were living in dangerous and unhygienic 
conditions, forced to work 12-hour shifts for between £95 and £176 a 
month.

The company was later forced to  
apologise in front of state deputies at Sao Paulo’s Human Rights 
Commission, and paid fines totalling more than £350,000 as well as 
compensation to  the workers.

Zara said yesterday they were 
‘surprised’ by the revelations and claimed they had not been officially 
notified by the Argentinian authorities.

A spokesman said: ‘From the limited 
information we have, which are the addresses of the workshops, they have
 no relationship with our suppliers and manufacturers in the country.’

He added that Zara has 60 Argentine 
manufacturers and in the last two  years conducted 300 audits of 
suppliers and factories, but would co-operate with any investigation.
