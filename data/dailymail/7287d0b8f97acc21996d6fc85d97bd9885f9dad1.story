Marriage counselor Sheila Loven told her client his marriage was over so he would have sex with her

After a former marriage counselor was convicted of sexual assault for having sex with one of her clients while she was treating him, another patient - a female - testified that she was also coerced into having sex with her.

A jury found Sheila Loven, 47, from Texas, guilty on Monday for her behavior when she was  taking John and Brenda Holliday, from Arlington, for joint 
therapy in 2009.

During the sentencing stage of her trial, a 35-year-old woman said Loven asked her during therapy if she had ever kissed a girl before and said it would make her feel better if she did.

Days after they kissed they had sex in a car together, something the witness said made her feel 'dirty' and 'wrong'.

She had initially come to the counselor after she split from her husband.

According to the Star Telegram, the woman told the court: 'Loven said it would make me feel better. Up to that 
point I had never had a homosexual relationship.

'I tried to think it 
through and it bothered me. I blamed myself. I thought it was me. It 
made me feel really dirty.'

Like Brenda Holliday testified last week, the woman said yesterday that Loven had become her best friend and that her therapist had described their meeting as 'God-like'.

The 47-year-old's guilty verdict came after four days of testimony from the Hollidays which described how Loven drove them against each other, advised the wife to file for divorce and told the husband his marriage was over before seducing him.

The couple reconciled after they compared notes and realized what Loven was doing. She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and $10,000 fine.

The female sexual assault victim also told the court yesterday that Loven asked her to hide her computer for her after she had falsified liability documents. She refused.

She did, however, submit false insurance 
claims on her behalf, which she has been granted immunity from in 
exchange for the testimony against the former therapist.

Trial: Loven in court yesterday when she was found guilty of sexual assault. She will be sentenced this week

Another woman, Stephanie Carroll, testified that she was having problems with alcohol, which is why she went to Loven.

She said that after her counseling ended Loven invited her to a bar and encouraged her to drink.

'Not even a friend would do that,' she testified, adding that Loven got so drunk they were asked to leave the bar.

Another former patient testified that she grew tired of Loven's drug and alcohol abuse and said she would often smoke marijuana and snort cocaine.

What upset her the most was that she often did this in front of her youngest daughter.

According to the Star Telegram, Loven told the woman's husband to buy marijuana and get her to smoke it because it would make her feel better.

She said in court yesterday: 'I had to
get away from it. So I moved out of state. I found a wonderful 
counselor who has helped me deal with this.'

The woman said she has been diagnosed
with post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorders and has been 
hospitalized for those conditions more than 20 times.

A tearful Brenda Holliday took the stand last week and testified about her relationship with Loven, which she described as 'visiting my best friend once a week to talk'

Sheila Loven counseled a couple in 2009 and allegedly used her counseling influence to encourage the wife to file for divorce, then had an affair with her husband, according to prosecutors

Another former patient, Sharon Creekmore, said that
Loven hurt her relationship with her eldest daughter, after she brought
to her in an attempt to improve her anxiety issues, according to NBC.

She said Loven rushed her daughter 
back into enrollment at college and that something happened over a period of two 
weeks that her daughter has never spoken about.

'I 
believe Sheila Loven harmed my relationship with my daughter,' Creekmore
testified. 'My daughter is now distraught to the point of being almost 
delusional.'

'It wasn't marriage counseling, it was divorce counseling,' Mrs Holliday said in court.

Tarrant County prosecutors charged 
Loven, 47, with sexual assault, accusing her of breaking state law by 
using her influence as a counselor to coerce the husband into having sex
in summer 2009.

Threatening and profane text messages sent from Loven were also read out during the trial.

After
the Hollidays reconciled, Loven is said to have sent them a number of 
cruel texts until they went to police and reported her for harassment.

One text message read: 'When are you going to figure out you are nothing without me. I made you into a man.'

A message to the man's wife read: 'And then he talks about your body so bad while he's touching every inch of mine.'

'I hope you enjoyed your lunch. Didn't see me did you?' another text said.

Wife
Brenda Holliday tearfully testified to the court last week that Loven 
became like a best friend to her and she believed she had found the 
perfect counselor, describing their visits like 'going to talk to my 
best friend once a week'.

'There was nothing I did not tell her,' the wife testified. I thought 
that she genuinely cared about me and I told her how lucky I was to have
found her.

'She told me it was a God thing. She would always give me a 
big hug before I left.'

Mrs Holliday also revealed Loven told her that her husband was a 'narcissist' and had stopped coming to sessions and following her directions to save the marriage.

All the while she was allegedly having an affair with him.

Loven's
attorney said it was a legitimate relationship which blossomed from 
romance and there is no evidence of emotional coercion. 

Adam Burny said: 'It had all the 
elements of any other romantic relationship. They went out to nightclubs
and dinner, and they spent almost every night together. What you will 
not see in this case is any evidence of manipulation.'

But the prosecution argued there was 
manipulation from the beginning - when she started to see them 
separately to 'collect their secrets' and then using these secrets to 
drive a wedge between them.

Loven advised the wife to get a divorce and then asked the husband on a date. Days later, the pair began having sex.

She
stopped office sessions with the husband but continued to have sex with
him, while continuing to counsel his wife, prosecutor Betty Arvin said.

'She was the ultimate inside trader,' 
Arvin said. 'She got information about their lives that they had never 
shared with anyone and she used it, she twisted it for her own sick 
reasons.'
