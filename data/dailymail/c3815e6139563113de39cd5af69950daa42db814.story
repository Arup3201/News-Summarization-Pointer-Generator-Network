Jimmy Savile's great niece has sensationally revealed how her grandmother knew he had abused her but kept quiet to 'preserve his fame'.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning Caroline Robinson, 49, said she was molested twice by her great-uncle, once aged 12 and again three years later.

But she said her grandmother Marjorie Marsden, Savile's elder sister, knew he had abused her and believes she was well aware he was a prolific and predatory paedophile.

Revelation: Caroline Robinson said her grandmother Marjorie Marsden knew the DJ had abused her and believes she was well aware he was a prolific and predatory paedophile

Speaking on ITV's This Morning about her
family experience, Caroline Robinson, 49, left, said she was abused by her 
great-uncle aged 12 and revealed that her family knew and tried to protect Savile's fame

She said she refused to confront her brother because she knew that if the DJ were brought to book, the 
comfortable lifestyle he provided for her would end.

She said: 'If we blabbed on Jimmy
or told tales, the fame that surrounded him would've gone. And I loved 
to say that Jimmy Savile is my Uncle - I loved to say it, it made me 
proud.

'But for him to suddenly be destroyed over something like this, 
the family would have had nothing.'

She said Savile had 'bought her silence'
and always looked after her, sending her on holidays, buying her a 
cottage, and put her up in a BUPA sheltered home.

After the star died last year, aged 84, an auction of his collection of mementos 
and personal belongings - including his Rolls-Royce which went for 
£130,000 and the original red Jim'll Fix It chair for £8,500 - raised 
about £320,000 for his charities.

Some of his properties are still to be sold but the proceeds will be given to charity. The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust had £3.7m in 2011/12 and the Stoke Mandeville Charitable Trust had finds of £1.7m last year. 

Caroline Robinson, pictured when she was younger, has recalled how Savile got excited when she sat on him

Ms Robinson recounted the full horror
of how Savile abused her to Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, 
explaining how he had called her over and asked her to sit on his knee.

Ms Robinson said: 'He called me over to sit on his knee, but
I was sat in the middle - when you sit on a persons knee, you sit on 
the side and put your legs down the side or in the middle but I was 
literally sat on the groin part of him.

Secrets: Caroline's grandmother and Jimmy Savile's sister Marjorie, who helped cover Jimmy's tracks

'And he talked to me and he'd 
lower the tone of his voice, so the more quiet he got the more I had to 
lean in to hear him. And then I thought there's something wrong here... 
and he was stroking my back, caressing up and down my spine, and it 
didn't feel right. It felt weird.'

Ms Robinson, now happily married to 
second husband David, said she remembers having a short skirt on and as 
she didn't want to spoil her best dress, she lifted her skirt up so she 
was sat on him with just her knickers.

She recalled: 'The more he rubbed he hand up and down my back and went closer 
towards my pants, I thought something's hard here... something's 
uncomfortable, what am I sat on? Car keys?...

'So the more I wiggled, the
more excited Jimmy got. And the next minute I knew, he had his hand on my 
bum, he'd gone into my knickers and his hand was on my bum.'

She added: 'This was in a room full of people. Nobody saw - he got it down to perfection.'

Ms Robinson said she made an excuse that she needed to go to the toilet and ran off.

She said: 'I'd like, wet myself. I know it's sounds a but rude, but it was like I'd wet myself. So I had to go to the toilet and I jumped up and I went out and I just cried. I just couldn't believe it. It was strange. I told my grandma... Jimmy's elder sister, who was sat opposite.'

Ms Robinson said she told her grandma, who died in 2006, about the incident and she said had said: 'It's only Jimmy, don't worry, I'll sort it out'.

Later in the interview Ms Robinson told how she didn't trust Savile, saying had touched her breasts and 'wanted me to touch his willy' at an engagement party when she was 15.

She also said that she didn't go to his funeral but wanted to, to 'make sure that he was dead'.
