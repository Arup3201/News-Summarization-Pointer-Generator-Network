Professor Simon Wessely warned authorities against a knee-jerk reaction to Tuesday's Germanwings crash and said pilots with a history of depression - like co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (above) - should not immediately be banned from flying commercial jets

Pilots with a history of depression should not be banned from flying commercial jets, a leading British psychiatrist has claimed.

Professor Simon Wessely warned authorities against a knee-jerk reaction to Tuesday's Germanwings crash.

He made the comments after it was revealed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental health issues and may have been receiving treatment for vision problems before he deliberately crashed the Airbus A320, killing all 150 people on board.

Around 100 commercial pilots in the UK have a history of depression with 42 currently on medication, The Observer reported.

Prof Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the aviation industry should not rush to change the rules.

He cited the response by health authorities to the crimes of Dr Harold Shipman, who is thought to have killed between 215 and 260 of his patients, as an example of ineffective policy.

He said: 'It is not a good idea to rush. It is like the response to Shipman - an utterly bizarre and unpredictable event is not a good basis of policy.

'The procedures that they then brought in would not have prevented Shipman.

'What does cause trouble is saying that if you ever have a history of depression then you should not be allowed to do whatever. That is wrong, as much as saying that people with a history of broken arms shouldn't be allowed to do something.'

Prof Wessely also stressed there was not a link between depression and aggressive suicide.

But a father of one of the three Britons killed has called for more to be done to see pilots were 'looked after'.

Philip Bramley, whose son Paul, 28, was on the flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, said: 'I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly.

'We put our lives and our children's lives in their hands.'

Questions continue to be asked about Lubitz's mental and physical health days after he locked the captain out of the  cockpit and brought down the airliner.

Authorities have already revealed he hid  a sick note declaring him unfit to work from his employers on the day of the disaster. Evidence found at his home suggested he was suffering from a 'serious psychosomatic illness', police said.

Officers reportedly found a variety of drugs used to treat mental illness at his flat in Dusseldorf, appearing to substantiate claims he was severely depressed.

According to German newspaper Bild the 27-year-old also previously told an ex-girlfriend: 'One day I will do something that will change the whole system and then all will know my name and remember it.'

Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph).

'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'.

A search team is still combing the two-hectare crash site. The second black box has yet to be found.
