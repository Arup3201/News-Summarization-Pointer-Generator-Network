PC Matthew Stott admitted drink driving and was banned from driving for 12 months

A police officer who kept his driving licence despite speeding at 100mph has been convicted again after being caught drink-driving.

PC Matthew Stott, 45, was banned for a year after he admitted driving while over the legal limit on the A14 in Suffolk in September when he appeared at Norwich Magistrates' Court this morning.

Prosecutor Oliver Haswell told the court that Stott - who admitted speeding in a 70mph zone in 2009 but kept his licence and job - had failed to stop for two police cars thinking it was 'former colleagues playing a prank'.

But Mr Haswell said Stott's passenger had repeatedly told him 'just stop' as cars with flashing lights chased him after spotting a defective rear light.

Two police cars attempted a 'boxing in' manoeuvre to force him to stop but had to abort this when it became clear he would not stop and the public may be at risk.

Mr Haswell added Stott, who claimed to have drunk two large glasses of wine, panicked and told his female passenger: 'My job, my job, I'm going to lose everything and I've only got six years left.'

He eventually reached his home in Stowmarket, where he agreed to a breath test.

Stott had previously denied the charge but changed his plea on the morning of his scheduled trial.

He had intended to fight the allegation on the basis that the breathalyser was faulty and officers had not followed correct procedures.

Heather Oliver, mitigating, said the police pursuit had lasted 'only five minutes'.

His breathalyser reading of 44 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath was only narrowly over the legal limit of 35, she added.

The PC said he had drunk two glasses of wine (posed by model)

Miss Oliver said that Stott had 'parlous' finances and his 24-year-career was now 'effectively over'.

'He will be punished over and above what many defendants would face in a similar situation,' she added.

District judge Peter Veits banned Stott from driving for 12 months and ordered him to pay a fine and legal costs totalling £1,115.

He said: 'You must deal with drink driving on a regular basis and you must see the consequences of that.

'It was a very unwise decision to drive that night and you exacerbated that by not stopping for the police.'

Stott was previously convicted of driving at more than 30mph above the normal limit at South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court in Ipswich.

He told the court he had been suffering from stress and was late for work.

But instead of banning him from driving, magistrates decided to put six penalty points on his previously clean driving licence and issue him with a fine.

At the time, road safety campaigners criticised that decision, labelling it an example of 'one rule for police and another for everybody else'.
