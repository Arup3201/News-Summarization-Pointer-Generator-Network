Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords has posted an inspirational video of her singing a duet with her music therapist, four years after a would-be assassin shot her in the head.

'Great to be back at Houston's TIRR Memorial Hermann and sing a few lines from "Annie" with my friend and former music therapist, Maegan,' Giffords wrote on Facebook.

'Wonderful people work here, and they do so much to help others get better'

Sing when you're winning: Former congresswoman Gabby Giffords has posted an inspirational video of her singing with her music therapist, Maegan, right, four years after she was shot in the head 

The short clip shows the politician-cum-gun control campaigner smiling and raising her one good arm as she trills lines from the musical's stand-out number, It's A Hard Knock Life.

Singing has been an important part of her rehab, the New York Daily News reports.

Six people were killed and 13 wounded, including Ms Giffords, when Jared Loughner opened fire at a Tucson shopping center car park where she was giving a stump speech.

Ms Giffords, who took a bullet to the head at point-blank range, still struggles to speak and walk. Her arm and leg remain paralyzed and she also has vision problems.

She has become a standard-bearer for the controversial issue of gun control after co-founding Americans for Responsible Solutions with her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly.

The gun control group raised millions for congressional candidates in the 2014 election, including Ron Barber, who replaced Ms Giffords in Congress after she was shot but lost his seat to Republican Martha McSally.

The group has garnered attention nationwide but has been able to do little to change gun laws.

The January 8, 2011, shooting shook Tucson, a city that considers itself a tight-knit community despite its half-million residents.

Among those killed was 9-year-old Christina Green, whose face adorns many of the memorial messages left at the shooting site and the hospital.

U.S. District Judge John Roll and Giffords aide Gabe Zimmerman were also killed. Loughner was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting.

Organizers with the January 8th Memorial, a nonprofit foundation, are in the final phase of selecting a designer for a permanent memorial to the victims.

The foundation hopes to finish the memorial this year, manager Michelle Crow said. It will be at El Presidio Park in downtown Tucson, but there are plans for other exhibits. 

Ms Crow said she wants the community to be closely involved in the selectin of the design and final memorial.

'People remember the day. They remember when they heard. They want to remember what happened that day, and they want to take part in an activity to commemorate that anniversary,' she told The Associated Press.
