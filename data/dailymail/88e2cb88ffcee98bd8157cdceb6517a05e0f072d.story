And take your partner by the claw... anyone for a spot of lion dancing?

If you think these two twinkle-pawed playmates know their way around a ballroom, you should see them dance the Simba.

And despite their razor-sharp claws, there was no blood on this dancefloor as the young cubs jumped and jived, shimmied and jigged, backed by a live band of birds singing in nearby trees.

Lion dancing: These two twinkle-pawed playmates clearly know their way around a ballroom ... although you should really see them dance the Simba

The Critterbug: And despite their razor-sharp claws, there was no blood on this dancefloor as they jumped and jived, shimmied and jigged, backed by a live band of birds singing in the trees

The two male youngsters - only five months old - did their best to avoid getting caught on each other's claws - or treading on each other's paws - as they danced the day away at the Kariega Game Reserve in South Africa.

Before the playful cubs start their routine, they crouch down and stare into each other's eyes.

The dramatic sequence adds to the drama of their special dance, which was captured by photographer Jacques Matthysen.

Mr Matthysen captured the intimate moment at the Kariega Game Reserve in South Africa.The 36-year-old said: 'The two young male lions were trying to play with their mother, but she was having none of it.

'They were quickly flung off their mother when she turned over to go to sleep.

Mane attraction: Mr Matthysen, who is head ranger at the reserve, managed to capture the shots because the cubs were on higher ground than him

'The lions then started jumping and rolling over the ground and it really looks like they are dancing.

'They were on their hind legs for three seconds each time - they were playing for half an hour.

'They look like ballroom dancers, you can almost hear and feel the music playing in the background.'

Mr Matthysen, who is head ranger at the reserve, managed to capture the shots because they were ten metres higher than him.

He added: 'The cubs were about the meters up on a slope from me, giving me these lovely low angle shots.'
