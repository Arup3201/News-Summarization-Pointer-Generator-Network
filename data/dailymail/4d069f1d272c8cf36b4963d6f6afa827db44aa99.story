Thoughtful: Naturist Keith Brookes leaving Grimsby Magistrates Court

A former mayor has been cleared of committing a sex act while sunbathing naked but is still banned from going into his garden without clothes on.

Keith Brookes, 67, was cleared of committing a sex act in front of other people and children when he was spotted by a neighbour.

The former mayor of Cleethorpes has been a naturist for 30 years and regularly enjoys sunbathing in his garden while nude.

But when he was accused of outraging public decency by committing a sex act he and his family found the accusations ‘devastating’ and he was subsequently suspended from the Conservative party.

Councillor Brookes appeared at Grimsby Crown Court this week where Judge Tremberg said he was of ‘positive good character’ and had spent much of his adult life serving the community on a voluntary basis.

She told him: ‘You took inadequate steps to ensure that you could not be seen.’

Judge Tremberg added that Councillor Brookes had been convicted of no offence and had not admitted, or been found guilty of, committing a sex act in his garden.

Jeremy Evans, for the prosecution, said neighbours were holding a barbecue with friends and two children could see that Councillor Brookes was sunbathing naked in his back garden and was asleep.

He was later seen by an adult looking over a fence applying sun lotion ‘but also to the area of his genitals’.

‘He accepts that he did not take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure he wasn’t visible by others,’ he added.

Councillor Brookes has been given a three-year restraining order, with a condition that he is banned from being in his garden unless his private parts are covered by clothes.

Councillor Brookes has said he was more than happy to accept this order in a bid to resolve any difficulties.

He said after the hearing: ‘I am delighted with this not guilty verdict, not only for myself and my family, but also for my Conservative colleagues, who I work with.

‘It’s clearly been a great pull on everybody’s health. This has opened the door for us to move on and get on with our lives.

‘I would like to thank everybody, including friends, local business people and neighbours, for all their support.’

His jubilant daughter, Kate Brookes, 34, said she was ‘truly over the moon’ at the ‘fantastic’ outcome of a not guilty verdict.

She said: ‘The past few weeks have been simply devastating.

‘The false accusations came as a complete shock. We are just so delighted finally to see the case not just dismissed from court, but officially closed with a ‘not guilty’ verdict.

‘To the kind and caring people who expressed their sympathy and backing following the malicious allegations- thank you.

Defence solicitor Richard Hackfath said: ‘This is a case about privacy. The defendant had created what he believed to be a private space in his back garden, where he believed he was not overlooked.’

‘He fell asleep at a time when there was no one about and, when he awoke and realised people were in the next door garden, he moved into an even more secluded position.’

‘He is a man with almost 40 years’ public service and he has had his reputation and private life dragged into the public domain and into the gutter by a misconceived prosecution.

The restraining order had been jointly drafted and agreed between the prosecution and defence ‘to calm a situation blown out of proportion’, said Mr Hackfath.

‘Mr Brookes has never broken the law in his life so it gives him no difficulty in agreeing to the order being made.’
