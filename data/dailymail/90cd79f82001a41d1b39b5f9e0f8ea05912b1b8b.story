Presenter Evan Davis has been announced as Jeremy Paxman’s replacement on Newsnight.

Paxman bowed out of the BBC2 news programme after 25 years in June.

BBC director general Tony Hall said that Davis, best known for his role on Dragons’ Den and Radio 4 flagship breakfast news show Today, would do an 'outstanding' job.

Evan Davis has been announced as Jeremy Paxman's replacement on BBC2 news programme Newsnight

The news comes after a turbulent period for Newsnight in which an investigation into Jimmy Savile’s sex crimes was dropped and a separate story led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly accused of child abuse.

The show’s female presenters, Laura Kuenssberg, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis, had all been tipped for the plum role.

The director general said: 'Evan is an outstanding journalist, an extraordinarily clever and intelligent interviewer.

'He has a wonderful presence on TV. I’ve got no doubt he will be a really great presence on Newsnight.'

Davis said on Twitter: 'I didn’t believe it when I read about it in the papers but now it’s official. I’ll be leaving @BBCr4today and heading off to Newsnight.

'I had been determined to outlive John Humphrys on @BBCr4today so I have failed. But you can’t turn down Newsnight.'

Jeremy Paxman said he was quitting because he wants to 'go to bed at much the same time as most people'

Davis will be the anchor for the programme three nights a week from the autumn.

A former economics editor on the programme, he has been a Today programme host for six years.

Davis, 52, studied at St John’s College Oxford and at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

He was an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies at the London Business School before joining the BBC in 1993 where he became economics editor of Newsnight.

In April 2008 he made his debut on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

A role presenting business reality show Dragons' Den soon followed.

In 2011 he presented Made in Britain, a three-part BBC2 series with an accompanying book on how the country pays its way in the world.

He was also one of a number of journalists involved in a BBC1 Panaroma special called Breaking into Britain.

Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis and Laura Kuenssberg will all continue to present Newsnight.

The programme’s editor Ian Katz said: 'Evan brings a rare combination of curiosity, intelligence and mischief to his broadcasting - just the qualities I want Newsnight to be known for.

'I’ve admired him from afar as a listener and viewer for years, and I’m thrilled that he’s joining us to help reinvent the show where he made his name in the 90s.'

Davis, who was formerly an economist before joining the BBC, said: 'While it is a scary prospect, it will be an adventure and a challenge, and I hope the viewers will be happy with the result.'

He pointed out that he felt 'terribly sad' to leave his present role and he paid tribute to the team: 'I have been there for over six years and those have been some of the most satisfying of my career.

'That programme is put together by remarkably few people, and I can’t praise them highly enough for their professionalism and companionship,' added the Oxford graduate, who also hosts BBC2’s Dragon’s Den.

The move came as a surprise to bookmakers, who had either Laura Kuenssberg, Eddie Mair or Krishnan Guru-Murthy pegged as favourites for the lead role.

Betting shop Ladbrokes said it took just one £3 bet on Davis landing the role.

David Williams from the company said: 'In bookmaker terms it is what is described as an absolute skinner.

'The odds were 25-1, which sounds like big odds but they were so big because so many people had gambled for the others, especially Laura Kuenssberg.'

Evan Davis announced his thoughts on the promotion on Twitter and said he 'didn't quite believe it'

Both Kirsty Wark and Michael Crick have taken to Twitter to congratulate Evan Davis on the new role

The BBC Newsnight editor, Ian Katz, also took to social media to congratulate the new host

Kirsty Wark has presented Newsnight since 1993 and was tipped for the spot along with fellow presenters Emily Maitlis and Laura Kuenssberg

Gwyneth Williams, the controller of Radio 4, said: 'I would like to thank Evan for his inimitable contribution to Today, marked by intelligent enquiry, wit and the exposure of hubris. His loyal audience of seven million listeners will miss his take on modern Britain.

'I, personally, would like to wish him every possible success at Newsnight. And I am delighted that he continues to present our idiosyncratic business discussion programme, The Bottom Line, on Radio 4.'

Davis's appointment ahead of Newsnight's Kuenssberg, Wark and Maitlis, came as the Trust pointed to a 'continued gender imbalance in BBC output'.

It said there needs to be 'a co-ordinated plan from the Executive' to address the issue.

It added: 'There have been notable individual examples of a new commitment from the Executive to improve the representation of women on air, and some broader initiatives, such as the commitment for 50 per cent of local radio stations to have a female breakfast presenter by the end of 2014.'

On a separate report on diversity, the BBC said it had 2,522 ethnic minority staff in 2012, rising to 2,553 in 2013.

The BBC's senior management boards are participating in 'unconscious bias training to address the challenge not to recruit" in their 'own image'.

The report said that women at the BBC have a redundancy rate of 51.9 per cent compared with the 48.6 per cent staff population.

Evan Davis has been no stranger to controversy in his time presenting the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

In 2012 he came under fire following an interview with George Osborne where he repeatedly spoke over the Chancellor as he tried to answer questions.

The interview began with the presenter asking Osborne if government borrowing would have gone up without income from selling the rights to operate 4G mobile phone services:

EVAN DAVIS: Just to be absolutely clear, if you strip out all of the accounting changes, the Royal Mail, post, the different treatment of banks, the asset purchase facility, all those things, if you take those out and you take out the 4G licence, borrowing would actually go up this year? It’s a simple, simple question, and I am asking you if that’s the case or not.

GEORGE OSBORNE: Well, I just don’t think you can strip out...

DAVIS: It’s extraordinary you can’t answer.

OSBORNE: I am sorry, I am answering your question, it’s not that I am not answering it, it’s like saying if we went ahead with the fuel duty rise in January, which is the same month that the 4G receipts are scored, well what would happen then?

DAVIS: Well that would be a perfectly reasonable question but I didn’t choose to ask it.

OSBORNE: Or, indeed, what happens if we do or don’t go ahead with the big increase in investment allowances.

DAVIS: Another interesting question which I didn’t choose to ask.

OSBORNE: I would say the money we get from the 4G receipts, which is an independent number, that money enables us in the round, with all the other things going on, to help small businesses to help fund capital investment, for example in further education colleges and schools. So it’s all part of a whole... what I am saying is that it’s a pretty desperate attempt...

DAVIS: Well it’s not a desperate attempt.

OSBORNE: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, as you know this is what the Labour Party put out to try and explain the fact that they put out for weeks in advance saying that the deficit was going up when in fact the deficit is coming down.

DAVIS: Mr Osborne, everyone was surprised, the Labour Party was surprised, the Institute for Fiscal Studies was surprised, a lot of people, I was surprised, people covering it on telly were surprised, everyone was surprised.

Downing Street complained to the BBC following the 13-minute encounter on Radio 4’s Today programme because of the ‘unacceptably hostile’ tone of the interview.

His interrupting tactic also caused backlash in an interview with Rochester and Strood Conservative MP Mark Reckless over the issue of increased rail fares, where it was argued he imposed his own bias on staying in the EU.

He concludes: ‘I don’t want to get into a big debate over welfare right now. We have got the point. You want to cut benefits. We are out of time.’

Earlier in 2012, whilst presenting the same radio programme, he controversially asked Boris Johnson whether Conservatives were as comfortable as Labour supporters with the Olympic Games as ‘a really fantastic advert for multicultural, multiethnic Britain’.
