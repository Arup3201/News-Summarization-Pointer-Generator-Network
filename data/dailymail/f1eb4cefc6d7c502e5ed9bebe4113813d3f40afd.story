Crystal Palace have been told to match Blackburn Rovers’ £5million valuation of Rudy Gestede or forget about signing the striker in the January transfer window.

The Premier League club are offering £3.5m for Gestede, but Blackburn have warned that their refusal to accept Hull City’s £10m bid for his strike partner Jordan Rhodes in the summer is proof that they will not be forced into a cut-price deal.

Manager Gary Bowyer said: ‘I think the owners have a valuation and until it’s met I don’t think he’ll be going anywhere. They proved that this season with Jordan Rhodes.

‘The conversation has been quite simple really: any offers that come into the club have to go to the owners and they will make the decision. We are no under no instruction to sell but we have to take any offers to them.

‘Obviously there’s been no deal done so in terms of both parties I think they are haggling over what’s the right figure for him.’

Although Gestede was said to have missed last weekend’s game against Wigan Athletic because he was not in the right frame of mind, Bowyer insists the 26-year-old Benin striker was left out because Blackburn thought a deal was close. And he warned Palace that the player will be in his squad to face Swansea City in the FA Cup on Saturday.

‘There’s been no question about the player’s frame of mind at all,’ he added. ‘If you’d seen him this morning throwing himself around in training, he’s in a good place. He’s a good person. He just carries on with his job.

‘We thought it might have progressed quicker than it did and that’s why he wasn’ t involved (against Wigan). There have been no further developments so he goes into the squad for Saturday. Unless anything changes before then he is looking at focussing on being involved against Swansea.

‘He’s conducted himself in a brilliant way. It’s not his fault people have not met the valuation put on him by our owners. All he can do is concentrate on getting ready for the game.’

Bowyer gave a mischievous response to comments from Gestede’s agent David Wancier that ‘the player really wants to sign for Crystal Palace but is also committed to Blackburn’.

The Rovers boss said: ‘It would be interesting if another Premier League club came in. There’s nobody at the moment, but that might make his agent think.

‘You’d have to take it up with him, I can only speak on Rudy’s behalf and how he’s been. He has been fine with us and is committed to playing on Saturday.

‘His relationship with our supporters is fantastic and I’m sure on Saturday they’ll be chanting his name. There is no question of Rudy not giving 100 per cent, that’s the type of lad he is.’
