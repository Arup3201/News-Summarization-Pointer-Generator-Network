In trouble: Christopher McGowan, 50, pictured outside Truro Crown Court, was jailed today for hiring a JCB to destroy his former home

A bankrupt businessman who hired a JCB to reduce his former home to rubble because he faced eviction was jailed for two-and-a half years today.

Property developer Christopher McGowan, 50, hired the mechanical digger before going on a £250,000 rampage inside the £470,000 six-acre property.

He 'ripped the guts out' of Silver Bow Farm near Truro, Cornwall - stripping its fixtures and fittings and crashing through walls, doors, kitchen and bathroom units.

McGowan carried out the 30 minute wrecking spree to 'punish' the new owners who were set to kick him out after he went bust, Truro Crown Court heard.

He was found guilty of two counts of criminal damage and Judge Christopher Harvey Clark said the only fitting punishment for his 'vicious, spiteful act' was jail.

'You set about destroying Silver Bow Farm beyond economic repair. You hired a JCB from a local firm and smashed through the back of the property,' Judge Clark said.

'Silver Bow was left in ruins and I am told that the cost of the damage is just under a quarter of a million pounds.

'In my judgement what you did was a mean, spiteful, vicious act against people who had done you no harm and who had allowed you to stay in the property.

'Your actions were undoubtedly bitter and resentful and you resorted to desperate measures to cover up your indebtedness.

'There is no excuse for what you did. You did it out of spite.'

Destruction: Silver Bow Farm in Cornwall after McGowan 'ripped the guts out' in 30 minutes of chaos

Bitter: The former owner used the JCB to smash down its walls and also took fixtures and fittings after being evicted

Prosecutor Philip Lee told Truro Crown Court that McGowan was declared bankrupt in 2009 when he was in negative equity with debts of more than half a million pounds.

He was setting up a £1million deal with Wycliffe Estates Ltd, managed by Christopher Taylour, but it fell through when he failed to disclose his bankruptcy.

It then emerged that he did not hold the legal title to Silver Bow Farm and was due to be evicted in September 2010.

Eventually Mr Taylour's mother Janet Taylour bought the property for £470,000 in February 2011 from McGowan's mortgage lenders.

The property developer was allowed to remain living there but could not pay his rent and an appeal against the eviction order failed in July 2012.

Upset: Bitter McGowan carried out the wrecking spree to 'punish' the new owners who were set to kick him out after he went bust

Mr Lee, speaking at a previous hearing, said the following month McGowan hired the JCB from a nearby construction firm and returned it within a hour.

He told the court: 'On August 16 he hired a digger and returned it within 40 minutes. The nature and extent of the damage is such that it can only have been done deliberately.

'The defendant has the motive and the inclination to punish the Taylours. He must have been responsible for the damage. There is another reasonable explanation.'

Police said the extent of the damage meant the house would probably have to be demolished.

McGowan of Chacewater, Cornwall, had previously admitted fraud and forgery and was jailed for 30 months.

He appeared for sentencing alongside hotelier Michael Owen, 53, of Truro, who had previously admitted assisting McGowan in trying to get Mrs Taylour to sign forged documents.

Owen was handed a suspended six-month jail term and fined £500.
