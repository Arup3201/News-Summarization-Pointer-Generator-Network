It didn't take much to outfox this clumsy garden pest.

The unfortunate fox was found hanging upside down after getting its tail trapped in a fence in Norbury, south London, for up to four hours.

It was spotted by a neighbour who alerted animal rescuers. They got the confused male free, but it lost the end of the tail.

Left hanging: This fox was spotted by a neighbour in Norbury, south London, who alerted rescuers

The fox had tried to climb over the fence, but his tail became trapped in between the fence panels - leaving him suspended upside down.

It is thought he was hanging there for about three to four hours before a neighbour spotted him and alerted the Riverside Animal Centre in Beddington, Surrey, on Saturday, April 6.

The centre is now fighting to save the young fox’s tail, of which two-thirds is left, but if he does not stop biting it he will have to have it amputated.

Ted Burden, the centre manager, said: 'Where he was suspended it has pulled all the nerves and as the feeling starts to come back he can’t rationalize it like we can - he just wants to bite it.'
