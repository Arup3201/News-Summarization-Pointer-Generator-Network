The man behind one of the largest online poker companies has admitted deceiving U.S. banks over the processing of gambling money.

Absolute Poker co-owner Brent Beckley, 31, was at a New York court today and is one of 12 people charged in a case seeking $3billion in penalties.

In April the U.S. government seized the domain names of the three largest online poker companies - Absolute Poker, Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars.

Beckley said he accepted credit cards from players from 2006 to 2011  so they could bet online and he disguised the purpose of the payments.

'I knew that it was illegal to accept credit cards from players to gamble on the internet,' Beckley said  in Manhattan federal court on Monday.

'I knew that it was illegal to deceive the banks in this way,' he told U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis.

Beckley hired so-called ‘payment processor’ Ira Rubin between 2008 and 2011 to help the company avoid U.S. gambling laws, an indictment said.

Rubin would allegedly process e-cheques for Absolute Poker disguised as payroll processing, affiliate marketing and for fake online merchants.

Rubin, who lived in Central America for years to avoid a telemarketing fraud charge, is close to a plea agreement, his lawyer Robert Cleary said.

Beckley pleaded guilty to conspiring to break U.S. laws against online gambling and conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.

The bank fraud charge carries a jail sentence of up to 30 years, but under a plea agreement he will likely serve only up to 18 months.

Full Tilt Poker owner Raymond Bitar, PokerStars owner Isai Scheinberg and Absolute Poker owners Beckley and Scott Tom were also charged.

Prosecutors detailed what happened to at least one-third of the billions of dollars the poker companies allegedly tricked U.S. banks into processing.

The money allegedly went directly to the firms as revenue through the ‘rake’ charged to players on almost every poker hand played online.

The government also filed a civil lawsuit against the Full Tilt Poker website and professional players Howard Lederer and Christopher Ferguson.

Government officials accused them and others of paying themselves more than $440million while defrauding other players.

Absolute Poker is based in Costa Rica. Beckley will be sentenced in April.
