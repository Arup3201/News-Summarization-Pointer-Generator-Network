A retired Nato scientist is hoping to make history by sailing a four foot remote-controlled model boat across the Atlantic.

Robin Lovelock, 65, hopes to become the first person to sail an unmanned craft - named Snoopy Sloop - 6,000 miles across the ocean as part of the Microtransat Challenge, launched in 2010.

The 30lb home made boat, constructed for 
less than £450 and put together in Robin's games room at his 
Sunninghill, Berkshire, home, will attempt to sail the seas powered by 
wind and a solar-powered GPS and steering system.

Challenge: Retired NATO scientist is trying to make history by engineering the first unmanned vessel to cross the Atlantic and to keep himself from taking the task too seriously, he's made the vessel a toy boat with a Snoopy figure attached

Labour of love: Mr Lovelock has spent four years crafting the four foot boat at a cost of around £450

Although Robin was more accustomed to developing military computer systems for Nato in his day job, he has constructed a pretty resilient boat - it has already sailed 5,000 miles, albeit in the comparatively still waters of Bray Lake near Windsor, over the last seven months.

Robin has already mapped out his route and will depart Barton-On-Sea on Saturday heading along the English Channel before heading south towards the Azores and then off towards the Bahamas, hoping to eventually land in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

The painstaking voyage, which will see Robin given hourly updates on the boat's progress along its pre-programmed route via satellite, could take as long as six months.

He says that a miniature Snoopy figure placed on board the tiny boat is to poke fun at academics who take the challenge 'far too seriously.'

Robin told the Telegraph: 'I got hooked about four years ago. I didn’t even play with model boats when I was a boy.

'I sometimes tinker on the boat in the lounge, but am usually banished to the games room by my wife.'

Helped by a team that includes a veteran of BBC's Robot Wars, Mr Lovelock seems to be confident that he will complete the challenge - he has already programmed the return route into the boat's navigation system.

The first Microtransat competition took place on a lake near Toulouse, France in June 2006 with three teams taking part.

A team from Aberystwyth University attempted the first transatlantic crossing in September 2010 setting sail from Valentia, County Kerry, Ireland.

But the team lost its track of the craft off the north west coast of Ireland.

The challenge has been attempted three times since 2010, with all three attempts failing.

Three more attempts have been registered for this year.

Sailing: The boat will rely on wind for power but will be steered by a solar powered computer and a GPS tracker
