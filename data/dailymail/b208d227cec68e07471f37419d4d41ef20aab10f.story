Mark Zuckerberg's sister has defended her decision to publish two children's books encouraging people to stay away from social media - even if it doesn't fit with her brother's business plan. 

Randi Zuckerberg, 31, worked at Facebook in its formative years, serving as marketing director for six years before leaving in 2011 to strike out on her own.

She says her brother Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is 'supportive' of her latest enterprises, both of which are released today.

Social media maven: Zuckerberg has written two books about navigating social media

Meet Dot: Randi Zuckerberg, older sister of Facebook founder Mark, has written a children's book about a girl named Dot who needs to learn how to live without technology

Working together: Ms Zuckerberg (left) worked at her little brother Mark's (right) company in it's early years, serving as the director of market development and spokesman for Facebook 

Since 
leaving Facebook in 2011 she has formed Zuckerberg Media, a media and 
production company that so
 far has a failed Silicon Valley reality show under its belt, had a 
child and produced the two books based on her ruminations on lifestyle 
and technology.

Given Zuckerberg's familial relations and work 
history, it has been noted that it seems disingenuous to take critical stance on a culture that she herself helped create.

In
 Dot, a picture book illustrated by Joe Berger, a small girl named Dot 
who apparently spends all her time on social media - she 'knows how to 
tap . . . to swipe . . . to share' - has her iPad taken away from her by
 her mother.

And in Dot Complicated, Zuckerberg covers how 
technology relates to etiquette, privacy, family and career, with tips 
and anecdotes interspersed.

Among other social media gaffes, Zuckerberg advises against oversharing, which she says 'can rob your partner of intimacy, as well as annoy your friends.'

In an interview with SF Gate she said she saw how easy it was to be consumed by silicon valley.

'It's easy, in Silicon Valley, to become absorbed in what we're building. It's important to raise your head and see the big picture. If I hadn't had a son, I'd probably still be there working 90 hours a week on projects, and be happy there.'

And writing her books she reveals how she relished the chance to turn off the technology.

'Gradually, over the course of a month, I loved being unreachable,' she told the paper. 'I saw that the world didn't end if I waited to respond to an e-mail in six hours, rather than six minutes.'

As
 someone who has committed her fair share of social media faux pas, 
Zuckerberg feels she's uniquely qualified to write about navigating 
technology.

New book: Randi Zuckerberg's guide to navigating our increasingly connected world

'Personally, along with being part of the team that 
built Facebook from early on, I also grew up on social media,' she told 
CNET.

'If people can learn from my mistakes, or feel more of a 
sense of connection with what I’m saying because I’ve shown some 
vulnerability, then I think we’re at a better starting point.'

Among other suggestions, Zuckerberg writes, in a sentiment many will agree with, 'Just because you can document your every waking moment doesn’t mean you should.'She
 told the San Francisco Chronicle that she never intended to be a social
 media doyenne, but found that the same questions kept arising 
everywhere she went.

'I did a lot of public speaking last 
year, and no matter where I went, people always asked the same 
questions: how can I better understand what my children are doing 
online? How can I ask my significant other not to immediately reach for 
their tablet in bed? How can I make sure I don't lose my job to someone 
who is younger and more tech-savvy?'She gathered their business cards and launched a newsletter, Dot Complicated, to address those topics.

Many of those thoughts have been collected in the book, of which she says her family, including her brother Mark Zuckerberg, approves.

My
 goal with this book is to spark dialogue and inspire people of all ages
 to embrace technology and the new sets of norms that come with sharing 
content online - something my family has always been supportive of,' she
 told CNET.

Attached: Like many girl her age, Dot loves technology - especially her tablet

Time to play: When Dot's tablet is taken away, she's challenged to find other ways to have fun

Recharged: But Dot soon finds other activities - like painting and playing with her dog - that entertain her just as much

Zuckerberg says the idea for the 
children's book came after talking with other parents who were worried 
about the affect new technology is having on the quality of their 
children's lives.

'Dot loves technology. A LOT,' explains Ms Zuckerberg on her blog.
 'She's obsessed with her devices (sound familiar?), but with a little 
push, she's reminded that life's a little bit richer when you look up 
from a screen.'

This is a topic close to home for Ms Zuckerberg, who has a toddler of her own, son Asher, with husband Brent Tworetzky.

'As I watch my two-year-old begin to discover technology, I feel certain that this is an important message to share with a younger audience,' she said.
