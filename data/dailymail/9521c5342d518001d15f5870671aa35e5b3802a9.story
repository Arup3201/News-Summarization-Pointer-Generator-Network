Deaths in England and Wales rose by almost a quarter in just month, shocking new figures showed today.

More than 60,000 people died in January, the highest figure for any month recorded in almost a decade. The sharp rise in deaths was linked to the spread of flu and cold weather by the Office for National Statistics.

But it comes amid a bitter political row about a crisis in the NHS, including long waits at A&E departments.

New figures released today showed that the number of deaths in England and Wales last month hit 60,888. 

It marks a rise of 11,168 deaths compared to December, and is 11,858 deaths higher than January 2014. 

The ONS said: 'The high number of deaths registered in January in comparison to the previous month is likely to be the result of circulating influenza and a period of cold weather.' 

However, Department of Health sources stressed it was too early to be certain about what had caused the dramatic rise in the number of deaths.  

The ONS publishes data going back to January 2006, when there were 49,005 people died in England and Wales.

The number of deaths usually peak in December and January, in part as a result of falling temperatures.

However, before this year the highest ever January figure recorded was 54,938 in 2009, some 10 per cent lower than the number last month. 

A  spokesman for the Department of Health insisted the government had not taken its eye of the ball this winter - and disputed the ONS's suggestion that there may have been a spike in flu deaths.

He said: 'Levels of flu have fallen in recent weeks and it is important to remember that these figures relate to deaths from all causes.

'The NHS has been well prepared for winter. We have given an extra £700million to help provide more doctors, nurses and beds. The NHS has encouraged people to stay healthy by having the flu jab and over half a billion has been invested to help people stay warm in their own homes.'

Figures last week showed how 'unprecedented' pressures on staff in A&E meant for the 15th successive week the four-hour waiting time was missed across England. 

Emergency departments in England saw 89.8 per cent of patients within four hours in the week ending January 11 - short of the 95 per cent target. The gold standard was last achieved the week ending September 28, 2014.

But the figures, released by NHS England, did show a step in the right direction.

The previous week just 86.7 per cent of those patients attending A&E were seen within four hours.

Experts said it was a further sign of the 'unprecedented' pressures facing the health service this winter.

A whistleblower warned last month that the NHS 111 helpline was putting lives at risk as there are too few staff to cope with demand.
