West Ham have wasted no time in revealing their new home kit for next season after Sam Allardyce's squad returned to training at Chadwell Heath.

Hammers stars including Ravel Morrison, Carlton Cole and Winston Reid posed in their latest strip as they arrived at the club's training ground to begin their preparations for the new Barclays Premier League campaign.

The adidas designed kit evokes memories of the east London side's classic striped shirt of 1985-86, which was worn by Frank McAvennie and Co as they helped the club finish third - their highest ever league position.

Preparation: Morrison, pictured here during training, is hoping to cement a place in Allardyce's side next term

Allardyce will be hoping West Ham's new shirt can inspire his side to an upturn in form after a dismal season ended with them narrowly avoiding relegation to the Championship.

Huge numbers of Hammers fans have called for the former Bolton and Newcastle boss to be sacked, but Allardyce has been backed by the club's owners David Sullivan and David Gold.

The pair have put in place a number of goals for their manager to achieve over the forthcoming season, including playing a more attractive style of football.

The club's former striker Teddy Sheringham has joined as an attacking coach to help the team score more goals and he arrived for his first day at work along with Allardyce and many of the first team.

Room for improvement: Sheringham will aim to get more out of club record signing Andy Carroll next season

Goalkeeper Adrian, who was widely praised for his performances last season, got a chance to try on his new yellow home jersey as he prepared to train for the first time this summer.

Club record signing Andy Carroll returned from his holidays with girlfriend Billi Mucklow as he bids to hit the ground running ahead of the Hammers' opening game against London rivals Tottenham at Upton Park.

Summer signings Cheikhou Kouyate and Mauro Zarate also posed with the new shirt as they got themselves acquainted with the club's training base.
