Scientists looking at charged particles in space have discovered particle hurricanes surrounding Earth.

These highly-charged particles are part of something known as the Van Allen belts, which are two concentric rings encircling the Earth and held in place by a magnetic field.

Since the Van Allen belts were first 
discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of 
the super-acceleration.

The acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belts.

Since the Van Allen radiation belts, pictured in this artist's impression, were discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to identify how the high-speed particles make their way into the belts. Two Nasa probes have now proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds

The Van Allen radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around Earth.

They are kept in place by the planet's magnetic field.

The belts range from an altitude of 1,000 up to 60,000 kilometres above the Earth's surface.

The radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are.

The belts were discovered in 1958 by 
scientist James Van Allen from the University of Iowa while aboard the 
first U.S space mission.

One theory suggested the particles 
were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside.

The second suggested that particles 
were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within.

Nasa sent probes up to track the 
behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that 
electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge 
them at super speeds.

Data from NASA's twin space probes 
suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local 
acceleration, similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of
warm ocean water on Earth.

This theory explains why the belts change shape - because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions.

Space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the high-energy radiation belts that circle Saturn and Jupiter, as well as around Sun-like stars.

The belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist James Van Allen from the University of Iowa while aboard the first U.S space mission. 

Researchers believe that the electrons contained within the rings of radiation had travelled from the Earth's magnetosphere - an area of space around the planet in which charged particles are kept in place by the planet's magnetic field.

They thought that as the particles drifted closer to Earth and the magnetic fields became stronger, they would travel faster and settle into a ring-shaped orbit. 

However, this type of acceleration process would take weeks and only applies to belts that change and grow gradually.

In the 1990s, satellites discovered 
that the energy and shape of the Van Allen belts was changing much 
faster than first thought.

This
led to a second theory which suggested that charged particles don't come
from the magnetosphere, but instead are caused when electric fields 
within the belts tear electrons from nearby atoms and accelerate them in
the process of tearing them from their source.

In 2012, Nasa launched two Van Allen Probes, pictured, that could simultaneously study the belts from different angles. Following a solar storm which blew most of the belt's electrons away, the two probes recorded a 1,000 times more electrons developed over a 12-hour period. Scientists believe that this proves that the electrons must develop from within the belt

in August 2012, Nasa launched two Van Allen Probes that could simultaneously study the belts from different angles.

Following a solar storm which blew most of the belt's electrons away, the two probes recorded a jump of 1,000 times more electrons over a 12-hour period.

Scientists believe that this proves the electrons must develop from within the belt, and are not collected over time.

Harlan Spence from the University of New Hampshire in Durhamco-authored the study.

He told Nature journal: 'We have in this one event been able to really distinguish between the different ways that particles can be accelerated. The radiation belts were the first discovery of the space age and it’s just really exciting with the Van Allen probes to have seen right to the heart of the process.'

Physicist David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute in Texas added: 'If [local acceleration of energetic particles] occurs in the heart of the Earth's Van Allen belts, it also probably does so in the more intense radiation belts around Jupiter and Saturn and even in planets around magnetized stars beyond the Solar System.'

Latest research proves that the belts create their own particles and don't just trap particles that travel nearby
