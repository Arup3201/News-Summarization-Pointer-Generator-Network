Tony Adams has urged England to 'throw caution to the wind' in Thursday night's must-win World Cup clash with Uruguay, but warned they must learn the defensive lessons from the loss to Italy.

The Arsenal and England legend says Roy Hodgson was too attacking in Saturday night's opener in Manaus and should have concentrated on a strong defensive performance to avoid defeat.

But after Mario Balotelli's second-half winner left England's hopes of reaching the last 16 in the balance, Hodgson has been left with little alternative but to go for it against the South Americans.

Former centre-half Adams, who won 66 caps for his country, told Sportsmail: 'The one massive negative from the night was that we were too positive.

'At times we did the English thing and went in with our hearts over our heads. We had a fixation with having a go and Hodgson had 65m England fans screaming for them to attack.

'I thought we were a bit naive, trying to win the World Cup in the first 20 minutes. I'm all in favour of being positive and going forward but only if we have a solid defensive unit.

'We should have worked more on the back four and Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson in front of them and prioritised trying to keep a clean sheet.'

Do or die: Roy Hodgson knows England must do everything they can to win against Uruguay

Uruguay are not the same proposition as Italy, as shown by their shock 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica, but with Liverpool star Luis Suarez returning from injury, they have the ability to unlock England's defence.

Adams said: 'There is extreme pressure on both England and Uruguay - this is a knockout tie.

'England will want to go forward and impress but they need to keep a clean sheet. Glen Johnson and Leighton Baines need to stay back and stay focused otherwise Suarez will expose them.'

Much of the discussion in the days in between the two fixtures has focused on Wayne Rooney's place and position in the team but Adams says others can play the No 10 role.

'If Rooney plays, he should be in the No 10 role but there are lots of options. Personally, I would have liked to have seen Rickie Lambert up there having a go,' Adams said.

Coming for you: Luis Suarez is fit again and determined to knock England out of the World Cup

'People are over the top with Rooney - what's wrong with taking him off after 60 minutes and letting someone else have a go?Â 

'I'd also back Jack Wilshere in that No 10 role. We do also have plenty of people to open up Uruguay with pace and quality - Welbeck, Sterling, Sturridge.

'Because of the result in the first game, we need to throw caution to the wind. All things considered, we should win.'

Shining light: Lionel Messi celebrates his splendid solo goal against Bosnia in the Maracana Stadium

With the first round of group stage matches completed and all 32 teams observed, Adams is sticking with his pre-tournament prediction of an Argentina win.

Lionel Messi's side weren't at their best in the 2-1 win over Bosnia-Hercegovina but with Iran and Nigeria to come, are well on their way to the last 16.

'I tipped Argentina before the World Cup and I hope Messi can inspire them to win because he's the best player I've ever seen.

'He can never be up there with the likes of Pele and Diego Maradona until he lifts the world Cup.'
