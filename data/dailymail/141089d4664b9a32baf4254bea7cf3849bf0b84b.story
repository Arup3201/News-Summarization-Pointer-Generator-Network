A policeman accidentally sprayed eight children as young as four with pepper spray during a bungled classroom display.

The officer was supposed to be using a mock canister filled with water - but instead performed the demonstration with a genuine version - spreading the potent chemical around the room.

Police have been forced to issue an embarrassing apology for the incident, which took place at school called Ysgol Gymraeg Gilfach Fargoed, in Caerphilly, Wales, on Wednesday. 

Shocked: Councillor Tudor Davies, who represents the town of Bargoed on Caerphilly council said: 'I'm amazed. As far as I'm concerned, this needs to be investigated. You don't pepper spray children at the end of the day'

The eight spray victims, all aged four and five, suffered from the effects at the time but are said to be fine now.

Councillor Tudor Davies, who represents the town of Bargoed on Caerphilly council, said: 'I'm amazed. As far as I'm concerned, this needs to be investigated. You don't pepper spray children at the end of the day.'

Yesterday parents also expressed their concerns over the shocking blunder.

One mother, who did not want to be named, said: 'My son was in the class when the pepper spray was released. We had a phone call from the school to say it had happened. 

Careless: Eight primary school children, all aged four and five, were left feeling the affects of the PAVA spray

'I'm not happy about it but at the same time, it seems to be a genuine mistake.

She has been monitoring her son for any problems and said she will continue to do so over the next few days.

A spokesman for Gwent Police said: 'On Wednesday, a schools liaison officer was delivering a lesson to pupils at Ysgol Gymraeg Gilfach Fargoed. 

'As part of the lesson, equipment that police officers use is demonstrated. This included a mock PAVA spray, which is usually filled with water, genuine PAVA sprays are not taken into schools. 

The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin - a chemical derived from the fruit of plants including chilies.

Mixed with other chemicals in a compound - the device is designed to irritate the eyes, causing tears, pain, and temporary blindness. It can also cause breathing difficulties.

Although considered a less-than-lethal agent, in rare cases it has been deadly.

'On this occasion a genuine PAVA spray was picked up in error, therefore, whilst undertaking the lesson and demonstrating the equipment, the spray was discharged in the classroom. 

'This resulted in eight pupils, aged four and five, being affected by PAVA spray.

'The pupils were cared for by school staff, and their parents were informed. Parents were contacted by a senior officer to explain what happened, discuss any concerns and offer our sincere apologies. 

'Medical treatment wasn't required on the day; however, parents were advised to seek medical attention if they had any concerns. 

'Further inquiries into the error are now being undertaken, and a result of the incident school liaison officers will no longer be taking any demonstration (mock) PAVA spray into schools.' 

A spokesman for Caerphilly council and YG Gilfach Fargoed said: 'This was obviously an unfortunate accident and we gather that Gwent Police are undertaking their own investigation. 

Embarrassing: Gwent Police apologised for the incident and said 'further inquiries into the error are now being undertaken' 

'Our main priority was the health and welfare of the children and swift steps were taken to ensure the pupils were removed from the classroom.' 

News of the shocking incident comes the day after police admitted to another demonstration blunder which left a seven-year-old girl with facial injuries.

The girl was hurt when an armed police officer accidentally fired a gun during a demonstration for winners of a colouring competition.

The incident, which left the girl with a minor injury to her lip, happened at Nottinghamshire Police's headquarters while a group of children and parents were being shown around the building in the Arnold area of the city.

The weapon was fired during a lunchtime visit on October 30 but the police force only made a public statement yesterday after details of the incident were leaked.
