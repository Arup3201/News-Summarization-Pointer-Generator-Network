A company boss has slammed the government's Jobsmatch service after his ad for a personal assistant who could 'speak excellent English' was queried because it could breach the Equality Act.

Paul Scully, who runs a communications firm called Nudge Factory based in Croydon, south London, said he tried to place the ad on the government's Universal Jobsmatch website last week.

But rather than the job being listed on the site - which has hundreds of thousands of jobs around the UK - Mr Scully received a response questioning his requirement.

Communications firm boss Paul Scully has been left angry by claims by a government-run website that his requirement a PA 'speak excellent English' could breach the Equality Act

After he asked for an ad stating that the successful candidate should 'speak excellent English', he was sent an email asking 'why the applicant needed to speak a particular language'.

The site - run on behalf of the DWP - said a 'justification' would be needed for exempting the ad from the Equality Act 2010, passed to protect against discrimination.

Mr Scully said he was 'stunned' by their query, which he branded 'a ridiculous example of politically correct red tape'.

He said: 'We want a personal assistant and said in the advert we wanted someone with good communication skills, experience as a PA and that they speak excellent English.

'When I heard back from Universal Jobsmatch they told me that in order to comply with the Equality Act I would need to explain why the successful candidate would need a good command of English.

'It's political correctness at its worst - there are thousands of small businesses out there who would benefit from this site, but if they are met with these sorts of questions and barriers it's not really worth the effort.'

The Department of Work and Pensions has admitted its checks may have been too strict in this case

Mr Scully has now withdrawn the ad from Universal Jobsmatch and is advertising elsewhere for the £18,000-£24,000 job.

The Equality Act is designed to stop employers discriminating against age, race, disability, religion and gender - but does not specify language.

A spokesman for the DWP admitted that checks may have 'been too strict'.

The Universal Jobsmatch website has come under fire for a series of blunders in the past. 

Among the jobs listed on the site previously was an ad for a hitman for MI6, which stated that an 'MI6 target elimination specialist' was needed.

Other ads included 'international couriers' for CosaNostra Holdings, also known as the Sicilian Mafia, as well as listings from pornographic websites.

The jobs website - which replaced Jobcentre Plus - has also been slated for hundreds of thousands of repeat or fake job ads.

He said: 'Universal Jobmatch is successfully helping people into work with around half a million employers now registered.

'We have robust procedures in place to ensure that vacancies comply with equality legislation and that jobseekers are not discriminated against.

'In this case, those checks may have been too strict and we are now reviewing our procedures.'

The Universal Jobsmatch website, launched in 2012, aims to match jobs with jobseekers on a 'free job posting and matching service'.

The site, set up by jobs firm Monster at a cost to the DWP of £17m - and which costs £6m-a-year to run - has been criticised in the past after advertising for fake jobs.
