A heroic Los Angeles-area taco stand employee saved a four-year-old boy from a deranged kidnapper.

Jesus Delgado, a grill cook at T2 Tacos, in Westchester, jumped out from behind the counter Wednesday and rescued Grady O’Brien from a North Hollywood man who took him after punching his nanny in the face.

Witnesses told KTLA the man was ranting about being in the CIA before sucker punching the nanny and making off with the child yelling he was the father – Grady’s six-year-old brother Brendan screamed for help until Delgado sprang into action.

Heroic: Jesus Delgado saved Grady O'Brien from a violent kidnapper after the deranged man punched his nanny in the face

The children were walking home from school with the nanny when the afternoon attack occurred.

The line cook bolted across multiple lanes of traffic on a busy thoroughfare to chase the would-be kidnapper down, witnesses said.

Delgado told KTLA he heard the young boy screaming for help and just reacted. Witnesses claimed they also heard the nanny screaming for help after she was punched by the foiled kidnapper.

‘He told me, 'It's not your problem, man. It's not your problem. Leave me alone with the kid,’ Delgado recalled to KNBC. ‘I said, 'This is my problem. This is my problem, because why you take this boy?'

The heroic man scooped up the frightened child from the unstable man and held him down until police arrived, according to reports.

Delgado told local media his dash to save the child was instinctual because he has a four-year-old daughter - 'I'm also a father,' he said.

'There were like 100 people standing here when this happened, he's the only one that did anything,' a witness said.

Where it all went down: Delgado is a grill cook at T2 Tacos

Brendan ran home screaming as Delgado tracked down his brother, the boy soon returned with father Tom O’Brien.

‘He ran home and said, ‘Someone stole Grady,’ O’Brien told KTLA.

‘All those thoughts were going through my head that I didn’t want to think about, like never seeing my son again,’ the father continued while fighting back tears.

The children both returned home safe and sound, but the condition of the nanny is not known.

Locals also took the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a neighborhood watch program to combat rising crime in the area, they told both stations.

O’Brien and a host of locals assembled Thursday night at the restaurant to thank their hero.

‘I’d like to think that if it was your kid in a similar situation, I’d have done the same thing,’ O’Brien told Delgado before hugging him to a round of applause.

O’Brien also gave him a check for an undisclosed amount to help pay for his four-year-old’s medical care, it is not clear what the young girl is suffering from.

Delgado seemed embarrassed by the attention.

‘I can't work. Everybody says, 'I want a picture with you!’ He told KNBC.

Older brother Brendan, when asked by KTLA what to do if the situation ever arose again, had wise advice.

‘Scream real loud.’
