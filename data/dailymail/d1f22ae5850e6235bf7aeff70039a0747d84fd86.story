Rush Limbaugh has blasted the hiring of Stephen Colbert as David Letterman's Late Night replacement and says that it should be viewed as an attack on Republicans.

'CBS has just declared war on the heartland of America,' the conservative radio personality said after the hiring was confirmed on Thursday.

Colbert shot to national fame in his satirical eponymous show, and though the character he plays has his same name, it is a parody of right-wing television hosts.

Attack on Conservatives: Rush Limbaugh (left) said that CBS's selection of Stephen Colbert (right) as a replacement of David Letterman was a partisan move

As such, he uses the comedy on the show to criticize many conservative issues by playing such an outlandish character.

'No
 longer is comedy going to be a covert assault on traditional American 
values, conservatism. Now it's just wide out in the open,' Limbaugh 
said.

'What this hire means is a redefinition of what is funny, and a redefinition of what is comedy.

'There's no unity in this hire. They hired a partisan, so-called comedian, to run a comedy show.'

This is far from the first time that Colbert has sparked ire from conservative critics.

Switching seats: Colbert said that he will not be playing the satirical version of himself that he plays on his Comedy Central show when he takes over David Letterman's post

The South Carolina native was hired to do the roast at the White House Correspondent's dinner in 2006 while President Bush was in office, and because he went in character, it turned into a seething parody of the administration.

Shortly after CBS made the announcement, Colbert clarified that the will not be carrying the satirical character over to this late night gig.

'I won't be doing the new show in character, so we'll all get to find out how much of him was me. I'm looking forward to it,' Colbert said Thursday.

Stephen on Stephen: Colbert, in character, commented on the news about Letterman's retirement but did not break character, so he did not acknowledge that he would be the one to replace him

By contrast, he also addressed the news on his show, as his character.

'I am going to miss this old man,' Colbert said while pointing to a picture of Letterman.

'Late Night debuted my first year in college. I learned more from watching Dave than I did from going to my classes, especially the ones that I did not go to because I had stayed up until 1:30 watching Dave.

'I do not envy whoever they try to put in that chair- those are some huge shoes to fill, and some really big pants,' he said, making a reference to Letterman's production company Worldwide Pants.
