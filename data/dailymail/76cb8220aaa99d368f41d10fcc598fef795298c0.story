If Manchester United needed to make a decision on the future of Radamel Falcao now, there's every chance they'd allow his season-long loan deal to run its course before sending him back to Monaco.

Fortunately for the Colombian, he has until April to turn around his disappointing form - and the unwanted statistics that accompany it - to secure a permanent deal at Old Trafford.

The numbers don't lie. Falcao has been less productive in front of goal during his four months with the Red Devils than at any of the European clubs he has played for previously.

His opportunities under Louis van Gaal have been limited due to injury - 12 appearances in the Premier League and one in the FA Cup so far - but he has done little to warrant United splashing out £43million to sign him at the end of the season.

As part of a £150m spending spree last summer, the Old Trafford club paid Monaco a £6m fee to take the 28-year-old on a temporary basis, while also agreeing to pay him wages of £285,000-a-week.

So far he has failed to justify that outlay, having scored just three goals for his new club. Even with creative geniuses Angel di Maria and Juan Mata behind him, it just hasn't quite happened for Falcao.

There is an argument that he is still finding his feet - and a regular place in Van Gaal's starting XI - after a calf injury kept him out for a month between between late October and November.

But his stats for the Red Devils tell a different story. Falcao appears to be a player in terminal decline after bursting into public consciousness with prolific spells at Porto and Atletico Madrid.

In his final season with the Portuguese side, the Colombian scored an average of 0.7 goals per game and had 1.7 shots on target every match. At United he has managed just 0.3 goals and 0.9 shots on target every 90 minutes.

Comparing Falcao's numbers while at Porto - a team who were dominating their division - with those he has produced in a United side who are still in transition under Van Gaal may be slightly unfair, but the trend continues throughout his time in Spain and France.

Falcao scored 0.71 goals per game in the 2011-12 season at Atletico and 0.82 the following campaign. He also recorded 1.76 shots on target in his first season and 1.56 in his second - all of which are superior to his numbers in the red of United.

A £50million move to big-spenders Monaco followed and he continued his good form in France before suffering anterior cruciate ligament damage while on international duty last January.

Falcao netted 0.53 goals per game for the Ligue 1 side and hit the target 1.41 times every 90 minutes - his worse stats for three seasons but still better than what he has achieved in Manchester.

To his credit he does have three assists for United, the same amount he managed in his first season in Spain and more than in any other campaign in Europe..

But strikers will always be judged on goals and, quite simply, Falcao isn't scoring enough of them or having enough attempts to convince us that he will find the sort of form which once made him one of the hottest properties in world football.

If he continues in the same vein, don't expect to see him at Old Trafford next season.
