A man spent nearly a year behind bars on charges that he raped a woman - even though a day after she made her accusation, she retracted it.

Darrell Dula, 25, who has been in jail since June 28 last year, was freed on Tuesday.

His surprise release came after 
Brooklyn prosecutors turned over a newly discovered statement that 
Dula’s 22-year-old accuser, a Jewish Orthdox woman, made to police in 
which she says he never raped her.

Freed: Darrell Dula, 25, spent nearly a year behind bars on charges that he raped a woman - even though a day after she made her accusation, she retracted it

Family: On Wednesday night, Mr. Dula was back at home in Crown Heights, playing with his three-year-old son for the first time in a year

By Wednesday night, Dula was back
 at home in Crown Heights, playing with his three-year-old son for the 
first time in a year.

He told The New York Times that he was 'overjoyed.'  'I’m relieved that the truth came out,' he added.

The ex-prosecutor in the case, has admitted she doubted the accuser's credibility, but the District Attorney's Office pressured her to push forward anyway. 

Shocking revelations: Brooklyn prosecutors turned over a newly discovered statement that Dula¿s 22-year-old accuser, a Jewish Orthdox woman, made to police in which she says he never raped her

Revealed: The day after the woman made the rape allegation, she told detectives she had been a hooker since she was 13, and had made up the story

The alleged victim made a complaint to 
police, accusing Dula of being part of a group who 
raped, beat and prostituted her since she was aged 13 - Dula was charged with forcible rape.

Strong words: Dula's lawyer, James Phillips, said the retraction is a 'smoking gun that destroys the credibility of this witness'

He was one of four men arrested - the other three, Damien Crooks, Jamali Brockett and Jawara Brockett, were charged with sex trafficking by District Attorney Charles Hynes back in June last year.

But the day after the woman made the 
rape allegation, she told detectives she had been a hooker since she was
 13, and had made up the story.

'When the detective asked her why did
 you make up the story? She replied and this is what the detective wrote
 in his official report, ‘Can’t a ho change her life?’” said James 
Phillips, Dula’s attorney to CBSlocal.com.

The woman also signed a recantation, but the case proceeded.

But it was only this week that Dula's lawyers learned of the recantation and police interview this week.

Prosecutor Rebecca Gingold discovered teh missing documents.

She had replaced Assistant District Attorney Abbie Greenberger on the case after she recently left her job.

Justice Wayne Ozzi was informed that in reviewing, Gingold noticed the documents were missing.

She found them down and immediately turned them over to Dula's lawyer James Phillips.

This week Abbie Greenberger has admitted she found inconsistencies in the 22-year-old accuser’s account:

'When
 I brought the inconsistencies to Lauren Hersh (chief of the 
sex-trafficking unit at the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office), I was 
told that I didn’t do my job right and that I’m trying to dismiss the case and that I should work harder,' Ms Greenberger told the New York Daily News.

Accused: Dula  was one of four men arrested - the other three, Damien Crooks, left and Jamali Brockett, right  were charged with sex trafficking - they remain in custody

Greenberger added that she was not aware of the controversial documents.

During a hearing on Tuesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court, Dula’s lawyer, James Phillips, said the retraction is a 'smoking gun that destroys the credibility of this 
witness,' Phillips said.

'The only witness against my client admitted to
 lying.'

The other defendants, Damien Crooks, Jamali Brockett and his brother Jawara Brockett, are still in custody.

Dula said he is hoping the case against him will dismissed when he returns to court June 11.

Strong words: 'The sex trafficking case against the other three defendants is not affected. When we discovered the recantation regarding this rape incident we immediately notified the defense attorneys said  District Attorney Charles Hynes

Although the district attorney’s office said it planned to continue the prosecution of all four defendants, The New York Times reported officials familiar with the case suggested the recent police report revelations will probably lead the authorities to drop all charges against Dula.

'The sex trafficking case against the other three defendants is not affected. When we discovered the recantation regarding this rape incident we immediately notified the defense attorneys,' said  Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes.

The DA’s Office declined to comment to the New York Daily News on Greenberger’s version of events.
