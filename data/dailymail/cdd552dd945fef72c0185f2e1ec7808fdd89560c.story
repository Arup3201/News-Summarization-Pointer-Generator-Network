The top tier of Wembley Stadium will be closed for the first time at an England game because of the poor crowd expected for Wednesday’s friendly against Norway.

The FA expect between 35,000 and 40,000 — less than half the 90,000 capacity.

That would make it the lowest attendance since the new stadium opened in 2007. The previous lowest was in November 2011 when 48,876 turned up for a friendly against Sweden.

England attracted 68,573 against Denmark in March and 83,578 against Peru in May, their two friendlies before the World Cup. But the fans have voted with their feet in the wake of a diabolical performance at the World Cup — England’s worst in a finals since 1958.

England’s new captain Wayne Rooney insists the figures are still promising considering events in Brazil. He said: ‘It is lower than normal, but still 40,000 or so, which is great considering the disappointment at the World Cup.

‘We’re always grateful to the fans, their support is second to none. Hopefully we can repay them with some good performances and exciting, attractive football to qualify for Euro 2016. That starts when we play Norway.’

England manager Roy Hodgson added: ‘We can’t turn back the clock, we can’t play Uruguay and Italy again. We can only play the game against Norway. 

'We are desperate to entertain the crowd who turn up. We’ve played matches against opponents who will not pull crowds in — San Marino, Moldova — in the last few years and had fantastic support. 

'We had a group of fans in Brazil who were fantastic. We’re happy with 40,000.’

Hodgson also responded to claims by Norway defender Vegard Forren, who lasted only six months at Southampton and failed to play due to a lack of fitness, that Rooney ‘looks a bit chubby’. 

The Manchester United striker’s fitness has been criticised throughout his career, but he took two personal trainers on holiday before England’s pre-World Cup camp.

Rooney, who looks lean, claimed he was not interested in the comments and Hodgson said: ‘Wayne is in fantastic physical condition.’
