A row has broken out in court over a ‘secret’ decision to appoint a new judge to preside over the retrial of four current and former Sun journalists accused of bribing public officials for information.

Judge Richard Marks QC, who oversaw the first trial of the men, was expected to officiate when the case is reheard later this year.

But at an Old Bailey hearing yesterday, it emerged that he had been mysteriously substituted by Judge Charles Wide.

It was claimed that more senior judges had intervened to put Judge Wide in charge. Judge Wide is the only judge so far to have presided in a case which has seen a conviction of a journalist in relation to allegations of unlawful payments to public officials for stories.

In an email to barristers on Wednesday, Judge Marks revealed that he had been taken off the case. 

He said: ‘It has been decided (not by me but by my elders and betters) that I am not going to be doing the retrial.’

Substitute: Judge Richard Marks QC, who oversaw the first trial of the men, was expected to officiate when the case is reheard later this year. But at an Old Bailey hearing yesterday, it emerged he had been mysteriously replaced by Judge Charles Wide

At yesterday’s hearing, a senior defence lawyer demanded an explanation for the move and suggested that it would appear as if ‘something has been going on behind the scenes’. 

Nigel Rumfitt, QC, representing Sun head of news Chris Pharo, said: ‘It cannot be a state secret. It is this sort of obsessive childish secrecy we get in this country which causes intense disquiet.

‘It was on February 4 we received an email, part of which I have quoted, that caused very considerable consternation, which very much gives the impression that His Honour Judge Marks has been taken off this against his will.

‘This deserves an explanation. The way this comes about gives rise to the impression that something has been going on behind the scenes which should have been dealt with transparently.’

Richard Kovalvesky, QC, for Sun reporter Jamie Pyatt, described the move to replace Judge Marks as ‘an extraordinary decision’.

He said he knew that ‘there is a significant variance’ between the judges on the issue of ‘mens rea’, a common law test of criminal liability. 

In reply, Judge Wide said: ‘Are you suggesting that a judge can’t change their mind after hearing fresh submissions?’

The court heard that the prosecution in the case had no objection to the change of trial judge and that there was no suggestion of unfairness.

Oliver Glasgow, for the prosecution, said he could not see an issue with ‘one fair judge replaced by another’.

Mr Pharo, Mr Pyatt, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll and ex-managing editor Graham Dudman face a retrial at the Old Bailey on September 21 after a jury last month failed to reach verdicts on some charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. They deny the allegations.

Mr O’Driscoll and Mr Dudman were cleared on some charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office at the trial at Kingston Crown Court.

The Sun’s picture editor, John Edwards, and former reporter John Troup were cleared of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.
