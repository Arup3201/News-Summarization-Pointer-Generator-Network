The Hollywood studio behind the Spider-Man and James Bond films says hackers have crippled its computer network and stole the private information of stars including Cameron Diaz and Angelina Jolie.

Staff at Sony Pictures Entertainment have been forced to 'sit at their desks trying to do their jobs with pen and paper' since the attack, by a hacking collective called 'Guardians of Peace', five days ago.

And today employees were told they may have to wait up to three weeks for the breach to be cleared.

Before Sony Pictures' computers went dark on Monday, the screens displayed an image of a red skeleton with the phrase 'Hacked By #GOP,' according to the Los Angeles Times.

The hackers warned the unit of Sony Corp that they had obtained 'secrets' that they would leak on the Web and released a list of files that it claimed it had stolen, including one called 'Cameron Diaz - passport' and another named Angelina Jolie passport'.

Other files they claimed they had taken included, 'media budgets', deals' as well as 'security breach course of action'. It is also believed they may have taken production schedules and passwords.  

'We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning. We continue till our request be met,' said a message that popped up on the computer screens, according to the L.A. Times.

Sticky situation: Sony Pictures is the studio behind the Spider Man and James Bond movie franchises

One security expert told The Times newspaper that Sony may be a target because 'many perceive it to have an attitude problem with their eagerness to sue hackers'.

A souce at Sony told The Times: You go to work and there are people sitting at their desks trying to do their job with pen and paper. It's the same all over the world.

'They're pretending its just an IT problem but its 100 per cent not ... The tech guys I know said files were wiped.' 

Sony Pictures spokeswoman Jean Guerin said the company's network was down as it dealt with 'a system disruption' and that technicians were 'working diligently' to resolve the issue. 

She did not give any details of the reported cyberattack.

Emails sent to Sony Pictures on Tuesday were kicked back with an explanation that its 'email system is currently experiencing a disruption.'

The Los Angeles Times said Sony Pictures employees had to resort to using pencil and paper to get their work done on Monday. 

It was unclear if the problem would affect the company's plans for upcoming holiday films, such as 'Annie,' or regular television programs including 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Jeopardy!'

Sony Corp has been a target of hackers in the past. In 2011, its video game online network suffered a major attack resulting in the theft of data belonging to 77 million users, one of the breaches to date.
