Sweet guitarist Andy Scott has been landed with a £50,000 bill after suing an Austrian for damages for selling one of the Seventies glam rock band's CDs on eBay for less than £1.

Dietmar Huber from Nüziders in Vorarlberg, western Austria, was shocked when he received a letter from a German lawyer accusing him of breaching the British group's copyright.

He said he was 'flabbergasted' when he got a bill for €2,000 from Mr Scott after selling the album for one euro (about 80p).

Mr Huber added: 'When I refused [he] took me to court filing an injunction stopping me from selling the used CD and demanding €36,000 in compensation.'

The original claim was that the 
album, called The Legend Lives On,  was not genuine and had been downloaded off the internet.

But later, after it had been proved that it was authentic, Mr Scott then claimed he owned copyright on the name and that Mr Huber did not have the 
right to sell the CD because that infringed his rights.

He was not
getting any money and had not authorised the sale and 
therefore it was illegal, he claimed.

Mr Scott took the case all the way to the Austrian OGH high court.

Now, after a five-year legal battle, the OGH has ruled in favour of the man from Vorarlberg, saying no crime was committed.

Paul Rusching, spokesman for the Austrian Consumer Protection Association, said: 'It means that in future Mr Huber and indeed any private CD seller can do such sales without any fear of legal consequences.'

The bill for the court hearing as well as Mr Huber's legal costs will now have to be paid by the band.

Mr Scott, who turned up in person for the hearing, gave the court a London address.

Speaking after the court ruling, Wolfgang Maier, the German lawyer for Scott, said: 'The end result according to the final court of appeal is that copyright and intellectual property protection in Austria is far short of what it should be.'

Formed in 1968, Sweet - also known as The Sweet - had hits with songs including Funny Funny (1971) and Blockbuster, which spent five weeks at number one in 1973.

Hell Raiser, The Ballroom Blitz and Teenage Rampage all got to number two in the charts in 1973.

They had their last top ten hit in 1978 with Love is Like Oxygen.

The following year their Scottish lead singer Brian Connolly left the band to go solo and Sweet split up in 1981.

Since the 1980s, guitarist Scott, Connolly and bassist Steve Priest have played with different line-ups of Sweet.

Connolly died in 1997 and drummer Mick Tucker in 2002, but Scott and Priest still perform in alternate versions of the group.

Not so funny funny: Dietmar Huber was able to prove he had legally purchased the CD and that it was not a pirated copy
