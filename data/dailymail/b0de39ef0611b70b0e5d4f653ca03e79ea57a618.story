The women's basketball coach at Boston University bullied the team so much that four members left, one considered suicide and two sought mental health care, the students have claimed.

The university has now launched an internal investigation into the claims against Kelly Greenberg, whom allegedly made cruel personal attacks on the players, particularly after they were injured.

The four players who have walked away from the team - Dana Theobald, Melissa Gallo, Katie Poppe and Dionna Joynes - were all on $60,000-a-year athletic scholarships.

'Giving up a 
$60,000-a-year scholarship is the hardest thing I've ever done,' Joynes, who moved back home to Maryland in October, told the Boston Globe. 'I hate that I'm not in 
school, but it had to be done. My spirit was broken.'

Investigation: Boston University's women's basketball coach Kelly Greenberg, pictured, has been accused of bullying by four students. They say she made personal attacks that left them needing mental health treatment

She said that she felt suicidal after Greenberg called her selfish after she suffered a concussion. She said 
she reported her suicidal thoughts to BU and was taken to hospital.

She said she knew she wasn't to blame - but that she was too scared to name Greenberg.

The other women reported similar stories of emotional abuse and anixety.

'I arrived feeling very confident and motivated,' said Theobold, who left in October. 'Then I felt bullied, threatened, and emotionally abused by 
the coach... She didn't treat us like human beings at all.'

Joynes 
and Theobald said they sought mental 
health care at BU because of Greenberg.

The women said it's not the first time they've been yelled at on the court, but said this time it was different.

'Attacked': Dionne Joynes, left, said the treatment left her feeling suicidal and requiring hospital treatment, and she dropped out of BU. Melissa Gallo, right, said she grew to hate basketball after Greenberg's coaching

Hurt: Dana Theobald, left, also sought mental health care due to the treatment and is now seeking to transfer schools, while Katie Poppe, right, is remaining at the school. All the girls were on scholarships

'All the 
yelling and screaming about basketball was fine,' Joynes said. 'We have all played for tough coaches. 
But I went to BU because I believed [Greenberg] was a great coach, and I
 was shocked by how it turned out.'

Gallo, who plans to graduate in May, agreed.

'I discovered that when you play for Coach Greenberg, 
you don't play the game you love,' she told the Globe. 'You play her game, an emotional game 
that is not about basketball.'

Poppe said she also felt emotionally abused by Greenberg, but she wouldn't comment any further as she wants to stay at the school. Her financial status is unclear.

The other women are also deciding what to do next.

Joynes said she is researching 
schools and financial aid and hopes she can attend another university in the fall. Theobald also hopes to transfer - but will no longer be playing basketball.

'I left BU 
hating the sport I loved,' she said.

Institution: Boston University, pictured, has now launched an internal investigation into the claims

Greenberg, who is starting her 10th season as head coach of BU's women's basketball program, was reported for similar behavior about seven years ago by most of her players.

The school has now opened an internal investigation into the latest accusations.

'We have been made aware of issues and concerns about Coach Greenberg, and we're taking a very serious look at them from both inside and outside of athletics,' BU spokesman Colin Riley said.

She would not comment on Greenberg's future at the school.

Greenberg has been credited with positively influencing players in the past and has the support of some of the current players, but the university did not make them available for interview, the Globe reported.
