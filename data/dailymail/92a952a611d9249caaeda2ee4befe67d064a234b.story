Talking to Ajax's official website, Campbell said: 'I hope to also catch up with Marc Overmars and Edwin van der Sar this week. It's interesting how many former players are back at Ajax in key positions. I'm very interested in the philosophy and training methods of Ajax.'

Campbell also tweeted: 'In Amsterdam for a week's training for my pro licence coaching badges, thank you #Ajax for your hospitality and making me feel very welcome!

'Nice to touch base with the #legend #DennisBergkamp again! @AFCAjax'

Campbell, who won 73 caps for England, retired from playing in 2011 following a brief spell at Newcastle United.

He won two Premier League titles and three FA Cups with Arsenal.

Campbell will be in the stands for Wednesday's game and added: 'Ajax work very much with individual coaches. That's the future, I think. I have spoken with Dennis, my contact with Ajax was through him. I'm trying to learn from him Marc and Edwin.'
