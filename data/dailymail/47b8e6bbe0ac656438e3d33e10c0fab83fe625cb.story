'Tis the season for gift-giving to the one you love most - and for 1,566 people, it seems that person was the tax man.

More than 1,000 people found the time to submit their tax return on Christmas Day, officials have revealed.

And the busiest time was between midday and 1pm, just before Christmas lunch, when 144 people pressed the 'send' button on their tax return.

A taxing Christmas: Online returns mean there is now no reason not to fill them in on December 25

HM Revenue and Customs also said 17,000 people sent off their tax return on Christmas Eve and another 4,493 on Boxing Day

The Christmas Day figure increased one per cent since last year, and the number of people filing on Christmas Eve was an increase of almost a fifth (19 per cent).

In total, 23,059 online returns were received over the three-day festive period - up by 12 per cent on the same three days in 2012.

Boxing Day, however, saw a decrease of four per cent on last year despite some steering clear of the sales.

Halifax also saw no break in people logging into their bank accounts, with 380,000 doing so on Christmas Day festive season to catch up on 
their finances, with 380,000 people logging on to their bank account on 
Christmas Day.

The deadline for sending in 2012/13 
tax returns and paying any tax owed is January 31.

Antiquated: With old-style paper returns, people were unable to leave it until the last minute

Taxpayers who owe
 less than £3,000 and want HMRC to collect the tax they owe through next
 year's tax code need to submit an online return by midnight on December
 30.

About 10.9 million 
people are expected to fill out a Self Assessment return for the 2012/13
 tax year.

Those who do not get
 their returns in on time are fined £100, even if there is no tax to pay or if the tax 
due is paid on time. This can be followed by more penalties.

With a population of 63 million, of course, the vast majority of Britons stuck to opening presents instead of online forms.

And some of the number could be taken up by England and Wales's 2.7 million Muslims, 820,000 Hindus, 420,000 Sikhs, 260,000 Jews or 250,000 Buddhists, none of whom celebrate Christmas.
