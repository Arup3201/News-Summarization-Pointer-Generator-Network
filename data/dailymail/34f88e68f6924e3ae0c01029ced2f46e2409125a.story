Parking ‘pirates’ are accused of issuing thousands of bogus penalty notices to travellers using railway station car parks on a busy commuter line.

Fines of £100 a time were handed out when drivers stayed beyond the permitted period at car parks belonging to Chiltern Railways.

But MET Parking Services was using the wrong law to issue the tickets, and is now accused of demanding money under false pretences from as many as 40,000 commuters.

The firm, which manages car parks on the line between Marylebone and Birmingham, admitted that 1,025 tickets were incorrectly issued and that 679 still outstanding at the beginning of the year were cancelled.

A pensioner is facing a £1,000 fine despite paying for his rail parking ticket.

Les Bradley, 70, even received a text message confirming he had paid the £3.30 charge.

But he claims the parking company has ignored the evidence. And he condemned the ‘heavy-handed’ tactics of Meteor Parking for forcing ‘easy touches’ to cough up.

Mr Bradley parked his car at Herne Bay, in Kent (right), at 4.40am on April 14 and paid £3.30 at the ticket machine for a day’s parking.

He thought nothing more about it as he left on a round trip to Newcastle for a meeting.

But when he returned at 10pm, he was outraged to find a £65 fine from Meteor Parking, which runs the car park on behalf of Southeastern.

After contacting the firm, he heard nothing more and assumed the ticket had been cancelled.

But two months later he received a letter ordering him to pay up or face a £1,000 fine.

He said: ‘I was really mad about it all – you can’t talk to anybody and they don’t seem to take any notice of what you’re telling them.

‘Are they just a money-making machine attacking the easy touches with heavy-handed techniques?

'I did everything by the book but they are still chasing me and now are threatening me…and ignoring everything I say.’

Meteor Parking did not comment.

The tickets were issued using a law introduced in 2012 which banned the use of wheel clamping on private land, but allowed the owners to issue penalty notices. However railway car parks are covered by different byelaws.

Commuter Trevor Carvey took on MET after receiving a ticket in Ruislip, Middlesex. He used the Freedom of Information Act to discover MET was using automatic number plate recognition cameras to identify drivers via the DVLA database, then pursue them for payment – often with the threat of court action.

‘MET and Chiltern have been using completely the wrong law to police these car parks,’ he said. ‘Thousands of people have been given tickets under false pretences and they should be getting their money back.’

Mr Carvey said his attempts to persuade the British Parking Association (BPA) to take action against MET have been ignored. Last week the Mail revealed how MET also targeted McDonald’s customers with £100 penalty notices for staying too long in its restaurant car parks.

MET chased motorists using a debt recovery firm that has been declared ‘unfit’ to operate by the Office of Fair Trading and a firm of solicitors shut down last year because of ‘dishonesty’. 

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has promised an inquiry into cowboy parking firms following revelations in the Daily Mail. He said that the firms should be prosecuted if found to be breaking consumer protection laws.

Hospitals are under pressure to sack ‘pirate’ parking squads after it emerged more than three quarters of NHS trusts use them to police their car parks.

Alex Shipp, who runs the Parking Prankster website, said up to 40,000 tickets may have been wrongly issued in Chiltern’s car parks.

He believes the 1,025 tickets admitted to relate only to Ruislip between October 2012 and January this year.

However MET is thought to have made the same mistake at all 21 of Chiltern’s car parks over the same period.

‘We need a full investigation. The DVLA and BPA should require that all the motorists involved are properly compensated,’ he said. ‘There is a very strong case to argue that this is a fraud and something the police should be looking at.’

The DVLA earns around £10million a year from private parking companies for the right to access its computer database.

A spokesman said: ‘It is not within our powers to instruct private parking companies to offer refunds.’

A Chiltern Railways spokesman said: ‘MET Parking manages all Chiltern Railways car parks. We work closely with them to ensure that our parking policy is fair and communicated clearly.’

MET refused to comment.
