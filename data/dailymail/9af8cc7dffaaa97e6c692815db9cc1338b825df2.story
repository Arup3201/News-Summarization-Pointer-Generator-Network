The picturesque hills of the Cotswolds were today shrouded in thick mist as Britain enjoyed calm and largely mild weather ahead of the onset of winter.

Spectacular photographs of the fields around Kingswood in Gloucestershire showed how the fog settled over the land as the sun rose.

And the golden glow which enveloped nearby Pauntley made it easy to forget that Christmas is just six weeks away.

Picturesque: The fields around the village of Kingswood, near Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, were shrouded with mist this morning

Calm: Mist is expected to persist in many areas of Britain for the rest of this week due to low winds

Grazing: Cattle in a field as the sun rose this morning over the fog-enveloped Cotswolds

Vivid colours: The trees stood red and gold having not yet shed their leaves for the winter

The peaceful conditions which have 
prevailed throughout November have been in stark contrast to the storms 
and flooding which marred the previous month.

Most areas will stay dry for the rest of today and into tomorrow, with conditions autumnal rather than wintery.

'This
 is fairly nice autumnal weather,' said a spokesman for the Met Office. 
'The nights are going to be colder, but the days are looking fairly dry 
and bright.'

Monastery: Three monks walk along the new nature trail in the grounds of Ampleforth Abbey in North Yorkshire

Discovery: The 1.5-mile trail around the historic abbey and school is being funded by a grant from Nature England

Peaceful: Brother Columba Moujing, Father Bonavanture Knollys and Father Philip Rozario look over the abbey's lake

Parts
 of the country can expect another thick blanket of fog tomorrow 
morning, with low winds allowing mist to build up over the West Country 
and Wales.

Frost will also build on the ground in rural areas tonight, persisting for the rest of the week.

Temperatures are set to be relatively mild for the next couple of days, with highs of 12C in southern England.

Mausoleum: The building is set into the grounds of Castle Howard, where the ITV series Brideshead Revisited was filmed

Golden: The countryside around Pauntley in Gloucestershire glowed during dawn this morning

Typical: The Met Office forecast that the 'fairly nice autumnal weather' would continue throughout today and tomorrow

Holding off winter: Freezing conditions have yet to arrive in Britain even though December is less than three weeks away

The thermometer will remain well above freezing even in the far north of Britain.

However,
 tomorrow night showers will sweep from the south-west across the whole 
of the UK, heralding a damp evening in most parts.

Areas of Scotland will also face strong winds later in the week, with gusts as high as 70mph.
