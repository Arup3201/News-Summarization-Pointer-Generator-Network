Stunning good looks run in the family judging by these exclusive images of Holly Valance's little sister.

Olympia Valance, 21, from Melbourne, Australia, has been announced as the new face and body of underwear brand Gossard. 

And the Neighbours actress told FEMAIL that she soon overcame her fear of stripping off to pose in the Fifties-style corsets and suspenders, saying the lingerie made her 'feel a million dollars'.

Olympia, who plays Paige Smith in the long-running soap, told FEMAIL: 'I have never really done any lingerie modelling and, as most girls, thought I'd be a bit self-conscious but the garments are so beautiful that they made me feel a million dollars when I put them on.

She admits that wearing the glamorous pieces was also a pleasant diversion from the more casual attire worn by her TV character.

'I wear a lot of sporty stuff on Neighbours and so it's nice to have a change.

Although she added: 'I like all sorts of different lingerie - from sports bras to suspenders.'

'I love the retro styles of the new Gossard collections, the high waist and long line bras are so sexy and feminine and feel really good to wear.'

Olympia said she's 'proud to fly the flag for real women with real bodies to be proud of'.

She added: 'Body image is such an important issue for me and that was one of the reasons I was so excited about working with Gossard. I have younger sisters and nieces and I know how hung up girls can get about the way they look.

'Some of the models you see are just impossibly thin and it creates so much pressure on young girls.'

Olympia was unveiled as the new face and body of the lingerie brand on Tuesday. 

Former Gossard girls include Sophie Anderton, who posed provocatively in black bra and knickers on a bed of wild grass in 1996.

Gossard was crowned the UK's Favourite Lingerie Brand 2014 for the third year running at the UK Lingerie Awards earlier this month.

And now it has teamed up with the stunning Australian starlet to launch brand new swimwear and lingerie collections.

She said: 'The last year has been a whirlwind and to work with such an established name as Gossard is a dream come true.

The actress flew to London - where her sister Holly lives with her property mogul husband Nick Candy - for the campaign.

Olympia said: 'I absolutely love working on Neighbours and the fact that I am able to come over to England and do an incredible campaign like this is a credit to the show's following, both here and down under, and I would like to thank everyone who supports us.'

Talking about working for the underwear giant, Olympia said: 'Lingerie is such an important, personal purchase for a girl and yet we - me included - buy badly fitting bras more often than we care to admit.

'I am excited about working with Gossard in all their ventures, from helping women to find the size and style that suits them, to collaborating with inspirational charities such as CoppaFeel!, this is something that means the world to me.'

A spokesperson for Gossard, said Olympia's 'enthusiasm and spirit is infectious' and said her 'commitment and professionalism is exemplary and she is a delight to work with'.

Olympia took to Instagram on Tuesday to announce her role as new ambassador for the British lingerie brand.
