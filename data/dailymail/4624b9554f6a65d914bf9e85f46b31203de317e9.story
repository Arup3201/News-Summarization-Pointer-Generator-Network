A California schoolteacher was arrested Wednesday after authorities clued in by an horrific odor found hundreds of living and dead pythons in plastic bins stacked floor to ceiling inside his home in suburban Orange County.

William Buchman, 53, was taken in on what will likely be animal cruelty charges after neighbors called to complain of the stench they called 'God-awful' and 'the smell of death.'

Investigators wearing respirator masks carried out 182 live and 240 dead ball pythons that could have been worth a startling $100K had they not been infested with mites, starving or worse.

Stench: Authorities responding to complaints of 'the smell of death' coming from an Orange County home found a collection of over 400 dead, living, and barely living ball pythons

William Buchman, 53, was arrested for neglect of animals after police found at least 350 pythons in his home

'The smell alone... I feel like I need 
to take a shower for a week,' said police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. 
'They're pretty much in all the bedrooms. Everywhere.'

Amongst the bedraggled snakes, officers found dozens of mice and rats cannibalizing each other in their cages after neighbors complained about the smell.

'We have rats that are dead in the cages with the live rats,' said Sondra Berg of Santa Ana Police Animal Services. 'They've actually become cannibal and eat each other.'

Buchman was still in custody Wednesday afternoon, Bertagna said. The Newport-Mesa Unified School District, where he works, declined comment, saying it was a police matter.

Infested: Police found 182 living snakes and 240 dead ones ranging from newly dead to bare skeletons. Here, veterinarians at an area pet hospital attend to the living ones, which were found rife with parasites and dehydrate

Cramped: The snakes could have once been worth upwards of $100,000. Here, the plastic boxes that were piled floor to ceiling in the teacher's home can be seen following his arrest

'God-awful': Authorities wore respirators as they removed the creatures because the stench was so overwhelming

Progressive obsession? Experts said many of the snakes were of breeding age. Authorities had actually visited the home one year ago, but found the mostly juvenile snakes to be well maintained at the time

Well liked: One parent at Buchman's Newport Beach school said the 53-year-old is an excellent teacher and that she would even testify on his behalf if she was called to

Buchman has not yet had a court appearance or been formally charged and it wasn't clear if he had an attorney.

Authorities
 said he lived alone, and neighbors said his mother, who had lived with 
him, had passed away within the past few years.

'His mother was a strong presence in his life,' Shelly Rooney, a parent of a child at Buchman's school, told NBCLA.

Rooney said that Buchman once broke down in tears as he discussed his late mother with her.

Despite that awkward encounter, and even after learning of Buchman's unsavory hobby, Rooney said she still supports the teacher.

'Mr. Buchman has always been a caring teacher,' said the Newport Beach mom, 'and one who I would gladly be a character witness if called to do so.'

Berg said four of the five bedrooms in the home were stacked from floor to ceiling and wall to wall with plastic bins on wooden and metal racks. The bins were packed so tightly, Berg said, that they didn't require lids because there was no room for the snakes to slither out.

Each snake was cataloged by name and 
type, and Berg said Buchman told authorities he was involved in a 
snake-breeding enterprise.

Plastic bins filled with snakes were stacked one on top of the other and some of the snakes had been dead for months and months

'House of Horrors: That's the best way to describe it,' Berg said of the house. 'I mean there's so many dead snakes ... ranging from dead for months to just dead. There's an infestation of rats and mice all over the house. There are rats and mice in plastic storage tubs that are actually cannibalizing each other.'

Some of the snakes were little more than skeletons. Others, only recently dead, were covered with flies and maggots.

Next-door neighbor Forest Long Sr. said he has known Buchman for years, adding the men had once been friendly, getting together to watch sports on television.

But he noticed a change in his neighbor about a year ago, he said, adding Buchman stopped coming around and, when he did, he appeared to have gained a good deal of weight.

'Something changed in Bill, yes it did,' he said.'Something triggered it because I couldn't even think that that was going on.'

Buchman told authorities he was involved in a type of snake breeding called 'morphing,' in which owners try to breed different color patterns in the reptiles

The odor from the house, meanwhile, became unbearable about five months ago.

'It got so bad as to where my wife would throw up,' Long said. 'She'd get out of the car and run into the house.'

He said neighbors speculated that there must be a dead body inside.

Bertagna said animal control authorities had tried to work with Buchman for several months after neighbors reported the smell. He said they sought a warrant after they were not allowed inside the home.

Berg said Buchman told authorities he was involved in a type of snake breeding called 'morphing,' in which owners try to breed different color patterns in the reptiles.

It was a very popular and lucrative enterprise 10 years ago, but has declined, she said.

'There was a lot of fast money in it, but now the bottom pretty much fell out of the market because there are so many of these snakes out there,'she said.

At one time, Berg said, a good specimen of the type authorities found could have fetched $5,000. Today it would be worth only about $200.
