A city in the Philippines has been named the selfie capital of the world today.

According to research, Makati City, one of the 16 cities that make up Metro Manilla, produces more self portraits per capita than any other city in the world.

Time magazine examined hundreds of thousands of selfies and found the city has 258 self-proclaimed selfie takers per every 100,000 people.

It found Manhattan produces the second highest number of selfies per capita - although a huge percentage will be tourists.

Miami is the third selfiest city, followed by Anaheim and Santa Ana, California, and Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.

Time ranked 459 cities in terms of selfie takers by looking at Instagram photos that included both the hashtag 'selfie' and the geographic coordinates.

The more than 400,000 photos used to make the database were taken between January 28 and February 2 or March 3 to 7.

The magazine said each day's data consists of the 24-hour period from midnight to midnight to account for all time zones equally.

Time said: 'For every city in the world of at least 250,000 residents, we then counted the number of selfies taken within five miles and divided by the population of that city.

'While the metric of 'people who take selfies per capita' is far from a perfect measure, it was far and away the most comprehensive means of comparing the 459 world cities that turned up at least 25 individual users in the database.

'Of course, this measure bakes in more variables than just a penchant for selfies, such as smart phone adoption rates and median income. As such, this list tends to favor regions just outside major urban areas.'
