One Georgia father became so frustrated that his daughter couldn't keep her room clean that he has decided to take out all of its contents and put it in the driveway while she was away at school.

On Monday, the father, who is a soldier based at Fort Stewart, placed his daughter's bed, desk, chair, bookcase and other items in the middle of the family's driveway in Ludowici, about 55 miles south of Savannah.

In front of the bed, on two large pieces of plywood, he wrote, 'Haley, room moved to driveway. Clean it next time.'

Getting the message: The father said that he later thought the move was a little 'extreme'

Breaking the news: Haley found out about the stunt when she got home from school

The soldier, who did not want to be identified, told WSAV that while in retrospect he thought the move was 'extreme,' he added that he warned his daughter to clean up or else be treated like a soldier.

His daughter is an honor roll student, he added.

As an added incentive for Haley to keep her room clean, her father hired a painter to give her bedroom a fresh coat of paint.

Easy access: The dad said that the blow was lessened when he told his daughter that he would paint all of her furniture before returning it inside

Military leadership: Her father, a soldier, had previously threatened to treat her like they do in the military if she didn't clean up when she was asked
