In the dream scenario Steven Gerrard's final action in a Liverpool shirt will be the lifting of the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium on May 30, his 35th birthday.

It will be emotional. For more than 16 years Gerrard was Anfield's beating heart.

The good times were great. He gave them Istanbul, a crazy, glorious night forever etched into the club's history. A year later, in 2006, it was his last-minute long-range strike that gave them life against West Ham in Cardiff.

In total there was a Champions League, a Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cups.

Even in the bad times (and there were plenty as a Premier League title remained elusive) the local boy was a source of Scouse inspiration.

When Roy Hodgson wobbled and King Kenny came back but could only lead them to eighth, punters in pubs from Formby to Fazakerley could take solace. 'At least we've got Stevie G'.

From next season, however, they will not.

They appear to be giant boots to fill. Imagining a Liverpool without Gerrard is like imagining The Beatles without Paul McCartney. But the show must go on and, in Jordan Henderson, Brendan Rodgers might just have the ideal replacement.

His goalkeeper certainly thinks so.

After Wednesday's 2-0 win over Burnley Simon Mignolet cast an early vote for May's Anfield election.

'Jordan is a massive player for us,' he said. 'He is a very positive character who always works hard and leads by example.

'He's vocal both on the pitch and in the dressing room. He goes in front of us and everyone follows behind.'

Can Henderson lead from the front like Gerrard? Can he carry the team on his back?

Some would point to the penalty spat with Mario Balotelli as evidence that the 24-year-old is not cut out for the job.

Gerrard, they say, would never have let the Italian take the ball. He would have shown him who was boss. The man himself said as much.

But they would be wrong to criticise. Balotelli, being Balotelli, was always going to try and take the penalty. And why not? Have you seen his record? Out of 29 penalties he has scored 27. Aside from his unpredictability, scoring from the spot is one of few things consistent about madcap Mario and Henderson, who has never taken a penalty in such a high-stakes environment, will have known that.

For the good of the team he made the right call not to make a fuss. Surely that is the mark of a good captain?

Gerrard, a fine skipper, was the master of responding to adversity and Henderson is no stranger to ramming critics' barbs back from whence they came. Since Sir Alex Ferguson's trial by autobiography he has written promising new chapters in his Liverpool career. Against Burnley he hit a netbuster from distance and then slid to his knees in front of the Kop. Sound familiar?

His accent may be more Wearside than Whiston but Henderson is now being talked up as a successor and for good reason.

He is not alone. There is a growing clamour to hand the armband to the Emre Can. The midfielder-turned-defender has been impressive since his backwards switch and was first to pick up Dejan Lovren following his penalty miss at Besiktas. The '#beast' is only 21, however, and his time will come.

Time will be up for US-bound Gerrard at Stoke or at Wembley. Whether it's in Brent or at the Britannia, Liverpool will bid a painful farewell to their talisman and he will be missed.

But if Gerrard remained the player that so often dragged his side from the turf Rodgers would not have allowed him to leave and that is worth noting when the inevitable tears are shed at his watershed.

In the six Premier League games that Gerrard has missed this season Liverpool have won them all

It is easy to get sentimental when it comes to such a figure. Gerrard deserves to be remembered as a legend because, in this world where the word is bandied about at the drop of the hat, he is one.

The fact of the matter, however, is that his impact has lessened considerably in recent times.

In the Premier League this season Liverpool have played 22 games with Gerrard in the side. They have won nine of those, drawn six and lost seven at an average of 1.3 goals for, 1.3 against and 1.5 points per game.

Without Gerrard they have played six games and won them all with an average of 2.3 goals for to 0.3 goals against.

Maybe those boots are not as big as they used to be.
