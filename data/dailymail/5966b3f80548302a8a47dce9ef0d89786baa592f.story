Thierry Henry has told Arsenal that they can’t be satisfied with winning just the FA Cup.

The Arsenal legend told the London Evening Standard that he believes the current team possess fantastic talent, and they should be pushing even further.

Henry said: ‘I think this team has talent - it goes without saying. When
 you see the season that Aaron Ramsey had, you can wonder what could 
have happened if he didn’t get injured.

'But you also have to be honest, 
Manchester City could say the same thing about Kun Aguero and the list 
goes on.’

‘As an Arsenal fan when you see Santi Cazorla play when you see, in a 
different way, Laurent Koscielny play - he is more of a hard worker, 
playing hard and when you see guys like Mesut Ozil, you can see Arsenal 
has a good future - but you have to back it up with something.

‘We will be here to support to make sure they bring something but I have
 no doubts about the quality of the team that they have and hopefully 
they can build on winning the the FA Cup and winning the title because 
that is what everybody is waiting for.

‘As a competitor and a fan myself you want more. You want that team to go further.’

Henry also believes it will come as a huge relief to his former boss, Arsene Wenger, that he'll no longer have to face questions about their barren trophy run.

He said: 'Now Arsene is going to be able to work with his team without having to answer every time “when are you going to bring some silverware back?” so that’s something that he can put on the side.'
