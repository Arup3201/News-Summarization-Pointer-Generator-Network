Ian Moorhouse has been banned from drinking in Kidderminster after being violent towards residents and police officers in the town for years

A thug has been banned from drinking in his home town after racking up 32 offences and being Tasered three times by police trying to control his drunk temper.

Ian Moorhouse has been the source of violence and disruption in Kidderminster, Worcester, since he was just 12.

One of the 22-year-old's victims was so badly injured he was taken into intensive care for days after being punched.

Police were forced to administer 50,000 volts to his body three times so he could be handcuffed after headbutting an officer and elbowing another in the face.

Moorhouse has been banned from entering Kidderminster town centre and nearby Bewdley on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings under the terms of a Criminal Anti-Social Behavior Order.

The three-year order also bans Moorhouse from using or threatening violence towards any person or drinking any form of alcohol in the town centre.

He is also banned from communicating maliciously either by phone, text message or social media.

Worcester Magistrates issued the order in September when the 22-year-old was jailed for three assaults including those towards police officers.

Police have urged members of the public to report any sightings of the man breaching the conditions of the order after he was released on December 20.

PC Andy Forbes of West Mercia Police, 
said: 'Moorhouse earned a reputation for being the main cause of 
disorder in Kidderminster on the busiest nights of the week.

'He
 picked fights with people, and tried to get into pubs and clubs, 
despite being banned from most of them, becoming threatening and 
aggressive when refused entry.

'Moorhouse’s
 behaviour is clearly unacceptable and people who want to enjoy a night 
out in Kidderminster or Bewdley need to be protected from him.

PC
 Forbes added that if the criminal breaks the rules of the Crasbo, as it
 is know, he could face going to jail for as long as five years.

'Several people have recently been jailed for flouting the terms of their CRASBOs or ASBOs, so this is no idle threat.'

The order was imposed at Worcester Magistrates Court (pictured) where the yob was jailed for a string of offences in September. He was released in December
