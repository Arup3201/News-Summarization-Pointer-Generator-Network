David Cameron went to ‘great lengths’ to woo Rupert Murdoch’s News International newspaper empire prior to the last general election, Lord Justice Leveson said today.

The judge added the Prime Minister’s closeness to senior executives like Rebekah Brooks had created a problem of ‘public perception’, although he accepted there was no ‘deal’ of newspaper support for the expectation of policy favours.

This prompted Mr Cameron to demand an apology from former Prime Minister Gordon Brown who said the Conservatives 'struck a deal' with Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers to gain positive coverage.

Lord Leveson said the Prime Minister had been right to accept that politicians had ‘got too close to the media’ and that the relationship needed to be set on a ‘better footing’.

'Too close': Lord Leveson said that David Cameron's close relationship with Rebekah Brooks had caused problems with perception

Politicians will now have to record all contact they have with journalists and publish it.

He said: ‘The problem is public perception. This section of the report has dealt with too many issues where the public, not knowing any more than it has (or, I might say, than what it reads in the newspapers), has been entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has been going on.

‘A way of conducting relationships with the media which leads to a situation in which a public inquiry is needed to take an objective, not to say forensic, look at the matter in order to reassure the public cannot be considered as satisfactory or itself in the public interest.

‘Mr Cameron went to great lengths to secure meetings face-to-face with Mr Murdoch and other News International executives and editors.

‘The benefits of this may have played some part in the outcome but should not be overestimated.

‘The evidence does not, of course, establish anything resembling a ‘deal’ whereby News International’s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours.’

Failure: Jeremy Hunt (left) should have had more
control of his adviser Adam Smith (right) and his contact with News 
Corporation lobbyist Fred Michel

Health minister Jeremy Hunt is the most senior politician to be directly criticised in the report.

Mr Hunt was Culture Secretary in 2011 when he was handed responsibility for the News Corp bid to buy the whole of BSkyB.

Spin: Lord Leveson also criticised New Labour's spin operation - led by Alastair Campbell

He is credited for putting in place ’wise and effective’ measures to prove he was handling the bid properly.

But Mr Hunt is criticised for the way his special advisor Adam Smith had significant contact with News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel.

’Mr Smith already knew Mr Michel, and when faced with the intimacy, charm, volume and persistence of Mr Michel’s approaches, he was put in an extremely difficult position. Best practice... was not followed.’

Lord Leveson ’doubted the wisdom’ of giving Mr Smith the job.

’The consequential risks were then compounded by the cumulative effects of the lack of explicit clarity in Mr Smith’s  role, the lack of express instruction that it was clear that he fully understood, and a lack of supervision by Mr Hunt.’ It all gave a ’perception of bias’, he added.

Concerns over how badly New Labour's spin operations, led for many years by Alastair Campbell, damaged public confidence in political communications were also raised by Lord Justice Leveson today.

In a bid to end the 'wilderness years' of the 1980s and 1990s Labour strayed into territory that some believed marked a breakdown of 'public trust engineered by political self-interest', the report said.

It added: 'If New Labour did not invent 'spin', it nevertheless found itself in an unprecedented place in relation to news management as an agenda item in its own right.

'On the one hand, its election-winning strategy in 1997 explicitly had in mind the lessons to be learned from the recent past.

'On the other, there is an obvious question about the extent to which a media strategy of 'neutralising' those sections of the press which had been hostile to the party in the 1980s and in the run-up to the 1992 general election became a victim of its own success, and resulted in diminishing public confidence in political communications.'
