Two 10-year-old girls with plaited hair blew themselves up in a market in Nigeria, killing four people.

The suicide attack in Potiskum, in the north east of the country, is the latest in a string of deadly blasts that have rocked Nigeria.

It took place yesterday afternoon at an open market in the town that has frequently been targeted by the militant Islamist Boko Haram group. 

A trader at the market, Sani Abdu, said: 'I saw their dead bodies. They were two young girls of about 10 years of age...you only see the plaited hair and part of the upper torso.' 

The suicide bomb attack killed four people and wounded at least 26 people, according to witnesses.

The deadly blast killed four people and injured dozens more, according to witnesses in Potiskum 

The attack follows a similar incident on Saturday, where a bomb was strapped to a girl aged about 10, which left at least 19 people dead in the city of Maiduguri, in Borno state. 

'The explosive devices were wrapped around her body,' a police source told Reuters.

In other violence reported on Saturday, a vehicle in Yobe state (northern Nigeria) exploded at a checkpoint near a police station, killing at least two people. 

The blast follows heavy fighting in the Yobe state capital Damaturu on Friday night, with buildings destroyed and civilian casualties reported. 

Last week, hundreds of people were killed in an assault by Boko Haram on the town of Baga, after they seized a key military base there on January 3. 

Boko Haram fighters razed the town and at least 16 surrounding settlements on the shores of Lake Chad.  

Yahaya Takakumi, a 55-year-old farmer, told the Premium Times in Nigeria he escaped from Baga with one of his wives and spent four days traveling to safety through the bush, but does not know the whereabouts of four of his children, his second wife and his elder brother.

'We saw dead bodies especially, on the islands of Lake Chad where fishermen had settled,' the newspaper quoted Takakumi as saying. 

'Several persons were killed there like insects.'

Nigeria's defence spokesman Chris Olukolade said: 'The attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since January 3 should convince well-meaning people all over the world that Boko Haram is the evil all must collaborate to end, rather than vilifying those working to check them.' 

More than 13,000 people have died in the Boko Haram insurgency in northeast Nigeria since 2009 and hundreds of thousands more have been made homeless.

The group have been fighting to establish an Islamic caliphate in the north-eastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.

Nigeria's military - west Africa's largest - has faced repeated criticism for failing to end the Islamist insurgency, as well as allegations of human rights abuses.

Soldiers have complained of a lack of adequate weapons and even refused to deploy to take on the better-armed rebels. 

The UN children's fund said harrowing reports from survivors of the attack and the use of 10-year-old girls as human bombs 'should be searing the conscience of the world'.

'Words alone can neither express our outrage nor ease the agony of all those suffering from the constant violence in northern Nigeria,' UNICEF executive director Anthony Lake said in a statement.

'But these images of recent days and all they imply for the future of Nigeria should galvanise effective action. For this cannot go on.'

The violence of Boko Haram began soon after 276 schoolgirls were abducted from the Borno town of Chibok in mid-April.

Nine months on, 219 are still being held.
