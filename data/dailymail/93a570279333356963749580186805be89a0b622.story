Lord Justice Underhill, pictured, rule that the mother had to allow her son contact with his father

A vegetarian mother refused to let her
five-year-old son have any contact with his father for more than a year
– because she feared he might feed him meat.

A
judge heard that the mother  was so worried about her son’s diet that 
she ‘put up the shutters’ and refused to allow him any contact with his 
father.

However, Lord 
Justice Underhill ruled that the boy’s welfare outweighed his mother’s 
fears, and warned her that her son will be sent to live with his father 
if she failed to comply with the court’s decisions over parental access.

The
judge, sitting at London’s Civil Appeal Court, said he was giving the 
mother ‘a last opportunity’ to remain her son’s primary carer. In 
August, a family judge in Bristol ordered a strict regime of contact 
between father and son – including overnight and weekend visits – and 
told the mother a residence order would be made in the father’s favour 
if she put a foot out of line.

The
mother, who is from the Bristol area, had been refusing to engage in 
the court process and the father  had not seen his son for more than  a 
year.

The mother’s 
barrister, Byron James, argued on appeal that the reintroduction of so 
much contact after such a long break was ‘too sudden and too steep a 
progression’ and was likely to cause both the boy and his mother 
emotional harm.

He said the boy’s father ‘insisted on calling him by 
another name’ and that the mother had legitimate concerns that the 
father would not comply with their son’s strict vegetarian diet or could
expose him to danger by failing to ensure he wore a car seatbelt.

He claimed the family judge was wrong to inflict on the mother the ‘latent threat’ of her son’s removal from her home.

The hearing, at the Civil Court of Appeal, sat in the Royal Courts of Justice in London

Lord
Justice Underhill recognised the bitterness between the parents and 
said that it was not the court’s purpose to ‘punish’ the mother, but to 
ensure that the five-year-old had a positive relationship with his 
father as he grew up.

Refusing the mother permission to appeal, he said there was ‘nothing even arguably wrong’ with the contact order.

However disruptive the son’s reintroduction to his father might be, the family judge had been entitled to ‘take the plunge’.

The
threat of the boy’s removal from his mother had had the desired effect 
and, although she may not have done so willingly, she had complied with 
the contact order since August, he added.

Recognising
that contact between father and son had been ‘very painful and 
distressing’ for the mother, the judge said he hoped there would be 
‘civilised interactions’ between the parents in the future and that 
issues, including his diet, could be ‘sensibly negotiated’.

He added: ‘I do, for this five-year-old boy’s sake, wish the mother and father the best in doing their best for their son.’
