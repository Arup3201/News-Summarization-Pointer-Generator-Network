Rio Ferdinand has revealed how Roy Keane gave him an 'absolute rollocking' on his first day of Manchester United training because he wasn't being 'positive' enough in his play.

The former England centre back moved to Old Trafford in 2002 and played with Keane for three seasons.

And Ferdinand has explained how the ex-Ireland midfielder showed him in no uncertain terms what it meant to be a United player.

In his column in The Sun, Ferdinand wrote: 'On my first day of training, he (Keane) gave me an absolute rollocking for playing an easy square ball instead of looking to do something positive.

'I saw that day why United were winners and why Roy was at the heart of it.' 

Ferdinand left United to join Queens Park Rangers in the summer and could be in Harry Redknapp's line-up for the clash with Aston Villa at Loftus Road on Monday evening.

His former team-mate Keane will be in the opposition dugout, with the Irishman having taken up a role as Paul Lambert's assistant during the summer. 

But former England centre back Ferdinand believes the manner of Keane's exit from United in 2005 was 'sad'

Keane is renowned for his straight-talking, no-nonsense approach to coaching and Ferdinand believes that will be rubbing off on the Villa dressing room. 

'He always expects the very highest standards and I'm sure he will be making his presence felt in the Villa dressing room,' he continued.

Having fallen out with former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and his assistant Carlos Queiroz over an interview he did with MUTV, Keane left United under a cloud in 2005.

The controversy which surrounded Keane's exit saddens Ferdinand. 

The 35-year-old added: 'I still think it was sad the way he left Old Trafford - but he was a tremendous influence on me while he was there.' 

Ferdinand was dropped by manager Harry Redknapp to the bench for QPR's defeat to Liverpool last Sunday
