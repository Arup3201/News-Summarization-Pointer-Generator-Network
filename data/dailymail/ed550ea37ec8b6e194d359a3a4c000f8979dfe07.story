US porn actor James Dean was highly critical of Sydney's popular Opera Bar

An Australian iconic venue is under fire once again after a US porn star launched a scathing attack on Sydney's famous Opera Bar.

James Deen, who's the star of Sydney's Sexpo exhibition, uploaded a highly critical review of the popular locale - describing it as 'the most god awful eatery in the existence of the universe'.

This is the second angry spray over the Sydney Opera House in two weeks, after veteran actor John Malkovich labelled the acoustics of the tourist attraction as 'hideous'.

Deen, who's real name Bryan Matthew Sevilla but is better known as his stage name which refers to the popular actor James Dean, didn't hold back on his self-entitled blog.

The 28-year-old recently visited Opera Bar upon recommendations.

'Beautiful as the scenery was, this was the worst food I have ever eaten in my life,' he wrote on Saturday.

Deen continued his rant, clearly frustrated at the service and ordering system at the bar.

'Hands down the most god awful eatery in the existence of the universe,' he wrote.

He did however admit the 'ambiance [sic] was nice'.

John Malkovich has labelled the acoustics of the Sydney Opera House as 'hideous'

Just two weeks ago, 60-year-old Malkovich described the acoustics of the Sydney Opera House as 'hideous' after his lacklustre brush with the venue when critics were less than impressed with his role in the Sydney Festival production of The Giacomo Variations.

'It's lovely to drive by on a motor boat and it has a very nice crew and very capable, but the acoustics are hideous,' Malkovich told The Daily Telegraph.

'I mean, I have only played in about 200 opera houses, and it certainly has acoustics that would do an airplane hangar a disservice.'

The actor also added it would be impossible to stage anything in the venue except a circus.
