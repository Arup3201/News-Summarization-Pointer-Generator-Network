Barry Walsh died after he was bit 42 times by a Staffordshire bull terrier at his home (file picture)

A man died after his girlfriend's pit bull bit him 42 times after she stormed out of his house following an argument.

Barry Walsh, 43, suffered five broken ribs and a ruptured spleen before he bled to death internally at his bedsit in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex in January this year, an inquest heard.

His girlfriend of seven months, Purdey Clarke, said her Staffordshire bull terrier Gypsy had bit him during a row and she stormed out, returning two days later to find him dead on a mattress.

Miss Clarke, 36, told the inquest at Chelmsford Coroners' Court on Friday: 'He slapped me round the face and my dog bit him. She was scared and she attacked him.

'He held her up by her two front legs and was going to go like this (pull them apart) and I had to take Gypsy out of his house to mine, because he would have done it.'

She added: 'I left and Gypsy didn't come out with me - it was very unusual for her not to come out with me.'

The court was told that Miss Clarke initially told police she had been away from Mr Walsh's flat for only half an hour, but at the inquest she admitted she had been away for two days.

Det Supt Lucy Morris said Miss Clarke had never given a 'coherent account' of the incident and the dog was 'running riot' when police arrived.

She added that because it had a history of violence, Miss Clarke signed over ownership to the police for it to be put down.

Consultant forensic pathologist Benjamin Swift told the court that Mr Walsh had sustained blunt force trauma, which ruptured his spleen and could have been caused by him falling on furniture, but said that could not be certain.

Some of the 42 bite wounds had been so ferocious they broke his shin. 

Corner Caroline Beasley-Murray said there were 'bits of the jigsaw missing' in the evidence and, as Mr Walsh and the dog were the only ones in the room at the time, she had no choice but to record an open verdict.

She said: 'We will never, ever, know or ever be entirely clear what happened.

'He was clearly much loved and it's good to see all of his family members here at the inquest. I hope you will be able to look back on the happy memories you have of him

At the time of the attack, neighbours said the dog was 'highly protective and edgy'. It has since been destroyed.

One said it was a 'very protective' animal that made him feel uncomfortable.

Billy Morgan, 53, who lived in the flat above Mr Walsh, said he had shared a drink with him and his partner at their flat to celebrate his birthday - where he also met the brown Staffordshire bull terrier.

He said: 'His partner told me it was very protective of her and they were always telling it "move", "shut up" and "sit there" while I was there having a beer.

'When I got my arm out the dog looked up. If you made a move, it would look at you or growl at you, it made me feel really uncomfortable.

'I don't know whether it attacked him because they were arguing - I have heard them talking loudly before but never shouting or rowing.'

He said the death had left him greatly upset, describing Barry as a kind, well-natured man.

He said: 'I still can't get over what's happened, it's such depressing news. I didn't sleep for the two nights afterwards because I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's a nutty world and this has really upset me.'

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Everyone in the house is so shocked that it happened. We can't believe it. I think it will be on a lot of people's minds whether they want to stay here now.'

Police said the Staffordshire bull terrier, which is not a banned breed in the UK, had been removed from the property following the attack and had since been destroyed.

Corner Caroline Beasley-Murray recorded an open verdict at Chelmsford Coroners' Court on Friday

An Essex Police spokesman said at the time of the incident: 'The death of a man found at a flat in Valkyrie Road, Westcliff, on Tuesday, January 7, is not being treated as suspicious.

'Prior to his death the man received injuries to his lower body consistent with dog bites. A Staffordshire bull terrier was removed from the address and has since been put down. 

'A post-mortem examination found the initial cause of death to be internal bleeding following a laceration to the spleen. 

'There appears to have been an incident whereby then man was bitten by the dog. It is likely that during this incident the man sustained an injury to his back and this then caused damage to his spleen. 

'It is not possible to say how that back injury was caused. The injuries to the spleen were not due to the bites by the dog.'
