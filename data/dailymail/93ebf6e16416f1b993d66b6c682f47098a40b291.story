Busted: George Boedecker, 51, pleaded not guilty to DUI in court today after his bizarre arrest last month in Colorado

The founder of Crocs has pleaded not guilty to drunk driving despite a bizarre confrontation with police last month where he allegedly blamed country star Taylor Swift - who was thousands of miles away.

George Boedecker, 51, was discovered slumped over the wheel of a black Porsche in Boulder, Colorado on August 12.

The entrepreneur also allegedly told arresting officers to go 'f*** themselves in the a**',

Police and paramedics said that when 
Boedecker got out of the car, which was partially on the sidewalk, he 
had trouble keeping his balance and was slurring his words.

A witness told police that Boedecker had gotten out of the car, and first said that he had pulled over to take a nap. 

He later changed his story completely, saying that his girlfriend had been driving, and she is 'bats*** crazy'.

Boedecker, whose other business ventures
include Domino's Pizza and Quizno’s, was approached by an officer, who 
asked what had happened.

A police report obtained by TheSmokingGun.com said that Boedecker told the officer that his girlfriend had been driving, and she ran away after the two had an argument.

When asked about the girlfriend, Boedecker told the officer that she is a singer who is 'really f****** famous.' He then asked if the officer had ever heard of Taylor Swift.

When the officer pressed for information about where the girlfriend went, Boedecker allegedly motioned toward a neighboring backyard, and then said 'Taylor' was in Nashville.

The officer wrote that Boedecker then became agitated, saying he was done with the questions that that things were about to get 'mid-evil'.

Wild claims: Boedecker is not believed to have ever been romantically linked to Taylor Swift

Shortly after that, Boedecker was 
arrested, but he apparently was not done talking, as the officer noted 
that the philanthropist told him and another responding officer to 'go 
f*** themselves in the a**' and that he hoped the cop would 'f****** 
die.'

Unfortunately for 
Boedecker and his story, Swift was in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, at 
the time of his arrest with her actual boyfriend Conor Kennedy and his 
family - about 2,000 miles away.

And
while Swift has dated such A-listers as Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor 
Lautner, and John Mayer, there is no evidence to suggest she has ever 
been romantically linked to Boedecker.

The wealthy Crocs owner is due back in court next month.
