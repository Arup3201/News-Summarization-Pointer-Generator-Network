Joanne Oliver died of swine flu in January 2011, six weeks after she was diagnosed with a chest infection

A bride-to-be died from swine flu less than six weeks after an out-of-hours GP prescribed antibiotics, diagnosing her with a routine chest infection, an inquest has heard.

Joanne Oliver, 31, rang the out-of-hours service for medical advice after complaining of a severe cough, aches and pains and bouts of sickness.

The mother-of-one's condition was initially treated as urgent.

But she was downgraded to routine after a 16-minute face-to-face consultation with a doctor in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

Miss Oliver, who was asthmatic, was prescribed the antibiotic amoxicillin, and other medication to control her temperature and was sent to a pharmacy.

Six days after her consultation the shop assistant's condition deteriorated 'drastically' and she was admitted to A&E at the Royal Oldham Hospital, struggling to breathe. Miss Oliver was assessed and rushed to intensive care.

Initially doctors believed the 31-year-old was suffering pneumonia. But Miss Oliver was later found to have the H1N1 strain of swine flu and was transferred 140 miles away for specialist treatment at Newcastle's Freeman hospital.

She spent three weeks fighting for her life, before being airlifted back to Manchester.

She passed away shortly after being admitted at the Manchester Royal Infirmary.

An inquest into her death heard the GP who treated Miss Oliver did not suspect she had swine flu because doctors had been given no direction to screen patients for a possible strain of the illness.

Five months prior to Miss Oliver's death on January, 17 2011, the World Health Organisation declared the notorious 2009 swine flu pandemic officially over.

But a week after her death, GPs were ordered to screen for the disease once more.

The Manchester hearing was told the tragedy occurred after Miss Oliver, from Oldham, complaining of feeling unwell.

She rang the Go To Doc service and was questioned by a trained call handler before speaking to a nurse.

She then had a 16-minute consultation as part of the three-stage service with Dr Susan Nelson at the medical centre on December 7, 2010.

The mother-of-one called the out-of-hours GP service in Oldham in December 2010, complaining of a severe cough, aches and pains and bouts of sickness

Four months before Miss Oliver complained of feeling unwell, the World Health Organisation declared the 2009 swine flu pandemic over

Giving evidence at the hearing Dr Nelson said 'Her symptoms included aching all over, back pain and vomiting. She had a slight ear ache, sharp pains and pains in muscles and she said the coughing hurt.

'I listened for any sounds on the chest and I listened to the heart as some conditions target it. There was air entry on both sets of lungs.

'She did not have a wheeze but signs of a chest infection. There were no signs of shallow breathing and there was no indication she had major breathing difficulty. I diagnosed her with Lower Respiratory Tract Infection.

'I believed she had a chest infection. This was the same diagnosis given by the doctor she spoke to over the phone.'

Dr Nelson prescribed amoxicillin and a painkiller to help her temperature and advised to see her GP within 48 hours if her condition failed to improve. The hearing was told patients visiting the Go to Do service are diagnosed as ‘urgent’ and ‘routine’ cases.

Miss Oliver's case had been triaged as 'urgent' after she spoke to a call handler and nurse, before being seen by a doctor.

After her consultation Dr Nelson downgraded her condition to 'routine'.

The hearing heard patients suffering asthma are considered to be in an 'at risk' group, who can be prescribed anti-flu medication Tamiflu, by GPs outside of a designated flu epidemic.

When questioned by Assistant Coroner Robert Chapman, as to whether Miss Oliver should have been treated as an 'at risk' patient, Dr Nelson said: 'In terms of a chest infection, no.

'There was a question of an asthma diagnosis but I did not feel she was an acute asthmatic.'

Mr Chapman asked Dr Nelson: 'One of the main issues is the emphasis made to Joanne about how important her state of health was at the time. Did you think she had got Swine Flu?”

Dr Nelson replied: 'No. It was before we were directed as GPs to look for swine flu, which was a week later.'

Earlier Miss Oliver’s stepmother Patricia Oliver, 75, told the Manchester hearing: 'Joanne used to walk everywhere, she was quite fit but she was a bit down at the time.

The 31-year-old was seen by an out-of-hours GP, who prescribed her antibiotics and downgraded the her condition from urgent to routine. She died six weeks later at the Manchester Royal Infirmary hospital

Swine flu is a relatively new strain of influenza that was responsible for a flu pandemic from 2009 to 2010.

It is also known as the H1N1 influenza, denoting the strain of the virus.

On August 10, 2010, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared that the swine flu pandemic was officially over.

Swine flu was one of the main viruses prevalent in recent winters and as a result it was included in the 2012-13 seasonal flu vaccine.

People suffering swine flu typically complain of a fever or high temperature - over 38C.

Other symptoms include aching muscles, sore throat or a dry cough - symptoms that are very similar to other types of seasonal flu.

For those in high-risk groups experts advise getting vaccinated against swine flu.

Those considered 'at risk' are pregnant women, people suffering chronic, long-term lung, heart, kidney or liver disease, people suffering conditions including cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's and diabetes.

People aged 65 or over are also considered to be at high risk of catching the strain.

Most people diagnosed with swine flu recover within around one week, even without specialist treatment.

In 2009 swine flu spread rapidly across the world, promoting health bodies to announce a pandemic.

The virus was first detected in Mexico in April 2009, but spread quickly from country to country due to it being a new strain. As a result very few people had a natural resistance to the virus.

The 2009 pandemic was not as serious as it was first predicted to be, and relatively few people lost their lives as a result.

If you suspect you have swine flu, you should contact your GP in the first instance.

'We were just told she had an 
infection but we first realised she was very poorly when we got a phone 
call from her saying she was going to A&E.'

Miss Oliver was admitted into hospital on December 13, where her condition began gradually deteriorating. 

Her step-mother added: 'When we went there she was in a mask.

'We were told initially that she had got pneumonia but later we were told it was swine flu.

'She was in the intensive care unit at Oldham hospital before being transferred to Freeman’s Hospital in Newcastle.

'At Freeman’s her mum spent time with her. We rang three times a day to make sure she was okay.

'We spoke to the nursing staff on the ward but just her mum went to see her. We were told she had got to the stage where theycould transfer her back to Manchester.

'It was a shock to know she was coming home so soon. There was no discussion about the reason why she was being transferred. We assumed it was because it was quite expensive treatment.

'We went down to see her at around 5pm. We were told she had arrived at 3pm into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). We saw her at 7.30pm. She was comatose at this point.

'At first a doctor had come to see us while we were waiting to see her and I felt elated.

'He said she would be okay, she would be fine. The information we were given then was very positive.

'We were with her for about 10 to 15 minutes and then we left to go home.

'We got a call when we arrived home that said to come to the hospital. She had died.

'We have had all these reports. They said she was in a critical condition when she left. Why was she transferred when she was in such a critical condition? Why was she not brought back by ambulance, why not come back by road.'

Dr Peter Holden, a GP and expert witness, said at the time of Miss Oliver’s illness, no advice was being given by NHS about the issuing of Tamiflu and concluded Dr Nelson 'had done nothing wrong'.

He added: 'Dr Nelson would not have been able to give Tamiflu even if she wanted. Out of hours is a high risk operation.'

Coroner Mr Chapman said: 'I am not concerned over the examination of Joanne.'

The inquest continues.

An earlier version of this article stated that Joanne Oliver had been seen by Dr Susan Nelson at Barley Clough Medical Centre. In fact, while Dr Nelson does work at Barley Clough Medical Centre, she saw Joanne Oliver while working for Go to Doc. We are happy to clarify this.
