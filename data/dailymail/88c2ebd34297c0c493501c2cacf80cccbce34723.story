If you just can’t get enough of One Direction, or you’re worried about missing the Miley Cyrus' latest antics - there’s now an app for that.

Microsoft’s Snipp3t lets users subscribe to news about their favourite celebrities.

Each celebrity has a profile page that includes relevant news and images.

All this information is gathered and collated from various sources across the web, and presented in an easy-to-manage snippets.

This includes news stories, videos from YouTube, relevant tweets, and more – all taken from Microsoft's Bing data.

To start following a celebrity, users can either search for their favourite famous person, or subscribe through Facebook.

This requires a user to connect their Facebook account to the app. 

Once connected, any famous people that the user has Liked on Facebook will be automatically subscribed to on Snipp3t.

These lists of celebrities can be manually edited at any time.  

And if people don’t want to subscribe to specific celebrities, or connect their Facebook account, they can see who and what is popular on the Trending and Top tabs.

Famous people also includes people who have died, and there are believed to be around 10,000 profile pages for celebrities available on Snipp3t. 

Elsewhere, Snipp3t members can add other users as friends, and each piece of content can be liked or commented on.

Snipp3t is only compatible with the iPhone on iOS 7, and is only currently available in the US. It has been optimised for the iPhone 5, but will work on other Apple handsets.

It is not known when the app will be available outside of the US, and MailOnline has contacted Microsoft for more information.

The app description said: ‘Snipp3t (pronounced Snippet) is a celebrity news app that snips everything you want to know about your favourite celebrities from all over the web and puts it in one place.’

In July, Facebook launched a similar celebrity-focused app called Mentions, designed to allow 'actors, athletes, musicians and other influencers' to chat with their fans.

It allows them to reply to messages, take part in live chats and post updates - without seeing newsfeeds, quizzes and ads. 

The Mentions app is more simple than Facebook's standard app, and shows social activity such as messages and shares relating to the celebrity.
