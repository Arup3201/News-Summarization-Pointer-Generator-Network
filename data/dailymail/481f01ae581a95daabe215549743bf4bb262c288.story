Tourists at the campsite where Saad Al-Hilli and his family were staying say they saw a suspicious eastern European man hanging around days before the family were shot dead.

A Dutch couple staying at the the three-star Village Camping Europa site in the village of St Jorioz said they noticed the smartly dressed man there at the same time as the Al-Hillis.

They added that they did not see anyone visit the family, but noticed the unusual man because he was dressed in a smart jacket while others at the site were wearing typical tourist clothes.

Switch: A Dutch couple said the massacre family had 
intended to stay for a week at the three-star Village Camping Europa 
site in the village of St Jorioz, but they switched sites two days before they
were gunned down

The family left Europa after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy

The couple described the man as of 
‘eastern European appearance like someone from the Balkans’. The 
Al-Hillis left that site after two nights and moved to the La Solitude 
du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy.

The revelation prompted speculation 
that Mr Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Ikbal, 47, and mother-in-law 
Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, may have had a disagreement with someone at the 
first site.

Saad al-Hilli, 50: Shot in the head

All three were shot in the head in last Wednesday’s massacre in the mountains.

The Al-Hillis’ eldest daughter, 
Zainab, seven, survived after being pistol-whipped and shot in the 
shoulder while her four-year-old sister, Zeena, lay undiscovered under 
her dead mother’s skirt in the family’s BMW for eight hours.

A source close to the investigation 
confirmed detectives were in the process of identifying several people 
who met the family during their brief stay at the Village Camping Europa
site.

According to witnesses, Mr Al-Hilli, 
an aeronautical engineer, was seen regularly leaving the campsite alone –
while a mystery man was seen wandering around during the time the 
family was there.

Dutch campers Jan Janssen and 
Anne-Marie Souderman said the Al-Hilli family checked in on Saturday, 
September 1 and left two days later. They did not book in advance and 
used a discount voucher to claim a reduction on the 30 euros (£24) a 
night charge. They were given a prime spot close to the swimming pool.

Mr Janssen said: ‘We were told they 
planned to stay all week but they left suddenly.  The father left the 
site in his car alone four or five times each day. He went out for 20 or
30 minutes each time.

‘The first time we thought he was 
going to the shops, but it was very odd to go out so often. We saw the 
grandmother and the older girl. They only had the caravan and we thought
it looked cramped for five people.’

It also emerged yesterday that a single weapon was used to carry out the murders.

Detailed ballistic analysis of 25 
spent cartridges found at the murder scene close to Lake Annecy has 
shown they all came from one 7.65mm sub-machine gun, probably a 
Czech-made Skorpion.

There would have been virtually no sound if, as seems likely, the gun was fitted with a silencer.

The revelation prompted fresh 
speculation that just one person – a highly-trained contract killer –  
was responsible for the frenzied shootings.

Saad Al-Hilli had blocked his late 
father’s will just four weeks before he was murdered, it was revealed 
last night. Documents reveal how Mr Al-Hilli had taken out a caveat 
effectively to stop his brother Zaid, 53, from receiving part of their 
father Kadhem’s fortune. It was put in place on August 8.

The formal legal notice reveals the 
bitter dispute at the heart of the Iraqi refugee family. Wealthy Kadhem,
a retired factory owner, had been missing from his home in Malaga, 
Spain, for six days before he was found dead in August last year.

He is understood to have owned a 
multi-million-pound portfolio covering properties in Spain, France and 
Switzerland, together with a £1million mock-Tudor home in Claygate, 
Surrey, where Saad lived with his family.

Emergency: Reports suggest the investigation is focused around a shed in the property

French prosecutors have previously 
revealed that British police have said they are investigating a 
‘conflict about money’ between the Al-Hilli brothers. Details of their 
relationship came to light over the weekend when it emerged that Saad 
had written a letter last year describing his older brother as a 
‘control freak’ who he wanted to ‘wipe’ out of his life.

Zaid, a former public relations 
executive, has strenuously denied there had been any feud and is said to
be ‘devastated’ by the deaths.

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was also shot dead after apparently stumbling on the bloodbath.

In her first haunting words since she was brought out of her coma, the girl of seven who survived the French Alps massacre told detectives: ‘I was so scared. What is happening?’

Despite being heavily sedated, Zainab Al-Hilli said she was ‘still frightened’ by what she saw.

The Surrey schoolgirl was pistol-whipped around the head and shot in the shoulder by whoever killed her parents and grandmother.

Despite being heavily sedated, Zainab Al-Hilli said she was 'still frightened' by what she saw after coming out of her coma at the CHU hospital in Grenoble

One theory is that her life was spared because the killer ran out of bullets. But her memory does not appear to have been damaged and detectives are confident she will be able to provide vital clues about Wednesday’s atrocity.

A respected French radio station yesterday reported Zainab’s first distressing words after emerging from her medically-induced coma in hospital.

Her maternal aunt, Fadwa Al-Saffar, a pharmacist who recently finished a PhD at the University of Reading, was at Zainab’s bedside when she woke.

It is thought Mrs Al-Saffar may now take custody of Zainab and her four-year-old sister Zeena, who lay hidden for eight hours under her dead mother’s skirt in the family’s BMW.

Delayed reaction: Several hours after police arrived on scene, Mr Al-Hilli's four-year-old daughter Zeena was found alive huddling under her mother's legs inside the car

Eric Maillaud, the chief prosecutor leading the inquiry, said: ‘Zainab has been in a coma and is under sedatives and cannot be questioned for now.

‘The members of her family who came are by her side. Without doubt, it is their responsibility to inform her of the death of her family.

We hope that the age of seven is the age of reason and that she will be able to provide descriptions about the number of people, whether men or women, the colour of their clothes, and who could have committed this.’

He added: ‘We hope she will provide lots of information, but the interview will be an extremely delicate one.’

Security remains tight around the Grenoble University Hospital where Zainab is being kept under police guard.
