Most bank account holders have heard of card skimmers, the insidious devices that steal your details from inside a cash machine.

Now, however, there is another danger to watch out for at the hole-in-the-wall - the 'cash trap'.

The simple, claw-like implement sits inside the slot that dispenses notes and grabs hold of customers' money until the thief returns to collect the loot.

Invisible crime: Claw-like cash trap devices, which are inserted into ATMs to grab cash before it can be dispensed to the customer

Rife: The simple contraptions inserted into cash-dispensing slots have been spotted in Lincolnshire and across Europe

The devices have been used at cash points across Britain, with 2,479 reported cases in the first half of 2012.

Fraud losses through cash trapping and other ATM scams across the UK came to £29.3million last year, according to Financial Fraud Action UK, although this is said to be dropping since chip and pin was introduced in 2004.

Such scams are already rife across Europe. Thieves stole more than a million euros from French cash machines this year using devices that prop open note-dispensing slots, according to security experts.

Police have warned account holders to be vigilant, but many devices are impossible to spot.

Some are designed to look like part of the 
machine and attached to the front, and others - such as the claw - 
are completely hidden inside the ATM.

This can mean that customers remain 
unaware of the problem and simply assume there is a fault with the ATM, 
failing to report the crime.

The European ATM Security Team advises customers to immediately report all incidents to the bank.

In August, Lincolnshire Police issued a warning to cash machine users after fraudsters tampered with three machines in Spilsby and Louth, pocketing hundreds of pounds from one transaction.

Officers
 warned anyone who spots anything unusual on an ATM, finds a device or 
notices part of the machine falling off to contact the police as soon 
as possible.

The tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated, varied and widely used. Here is how they have developed:

Spring traps: Once a card has been inserted, these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the ATM from retracting it.

Cash traps: Claw-like implements are inserted into cash-dispensing slot to 'capture or skim some of the dispensed bills'.

Jammers: An oversized fork-like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal ATM transaction.

Skimmers: Thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers. The data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at ATM along with victim’s PIN to withdraw cash.

Transaction reversal fraud: Involves 'tricking' ATM into not debiting some of the cash that has been taken or manipulating the ATM to pay more than the balance available. Can be done via clips or fingers or by removing some notes so machine does not realise it has dispensed them. 

A spokesperson for the force said: 
'Unfortunately, there was insufficient forensic and CCTV evidence [in 
Louth] to progress the investigation and no arrests were made. 

'The Spilsby incidents related to ATMs possibly being tampered with and no actual thefts occurred. 

'The banks don’t always notify police
 in these cases if no crime has taken place and their own fraud 
departments investigate the matter.

'ATM tampering is obviously a 
nationwide issue and we work with the banks to raise awareness and 
educate the public about how to protect themselves from fraud and what 
things to be on the lookout for.'

Most of the crimes apparently take place outside of normal banking hours.

A spokesperson for EAST said: 'The criminals operate by cash being collected by a customer. As
 far as a customer is concerned everything can be going fine with their 
transaction and the receipt - if they get one - can say "£20 taken out",
 but they've got no money.

'The
 cash trap is normally placed across the front of the cash dispensing 
slot, either with adhesive or a spring. The claw is one variant, which 
is placed inside machine and is a little more sophisticated.

'The criminals make one transaction and insert the device while the slot is open.

'We
 saw a significant increase in these attacks in 2011, with 15 European 
countries reporting such crimes, and a surge in the second half of the 
year.

'The success of 
chip and pin seems to be driving criminals from high-tech card skimming 
to low-tech techniques such as cash trapping.

'This can be combined with other ways of manipulating the ATM.'

It is estimated that in the first six months of 2004, more than £40.5million was fraudulently taken from customers' accounts using card skimming in London and the South-East alone.

In March 2005, Dover-based Kenneth Mennie had £1,500 stolen from his Lloyds TSB current account after his debit card was copied and used in Thailand.

Four months later, five Romanians stole 
up to £1.2m by sticking false fronts to ATMs across London to skim
 unwitting customers' cards and film their PIN numbers being entered.

A laptop found at the gang's safe house contained details of 1,236 bank cards.

It is believed most of the cash was channelled to Romania in a 'fruitful and sophisticated fraud'.

Helping themselves: Thieves stole more than a million Euros from French cash machines this year using a similar technique, pictured, in which cash-dispensing slots are propped open after normal transactions

Since the advent of chip and pin, 
however, cash traps may be the most worrying trend, because they are 
simple, cheap and spreading fast.

Earlier
 this year, industry experts reported on the danger of 'robbing by 
radiowave' - in which thieves access 'contactless' cardholders' details 
simply by walking past them in the street and activating a handheld machine.

A spokesperson for Vocalink told 
MailOnline they had seen a move back to more traditional methods of 
fraud such as shoulder surfing since chip and pin came in.

Cardholders who are given a 
contactless card when their old one expires can unknowingly surrender 
their details to a thief by simply walking past them in the street.

The technology in the card, known as radio frequency identification (RFID), transmits bank details via its own radio signal, and is accepted in many High Street chains, including Co-op, Boots and Pret-a-Manger.

Lucrative scam: A simple fork, pictured, can be placed inside the machine to hold it open after customers have left

It does away with the need for a 
customer inputting their PIN when buying goods, and was designed to 
reduce queues at the checkout.

However,
 a fraudster with a contactless cardreader can easily collect the 
16-digit credit card number, expiry date and  name – known as RFID 
skimming – from anyone who walks past carrying one of the new cards.

They
 then have enough information to rack up huge bills at any internet 
shopping site that does not demand the three-digit security code on the 
back of the card.

David 
Maxwell, a former policeman and director of RFIDprotect, a firm which 
specialises in protection against card fraud, said: ‘It has been a big 
problem in America for a while and is getting to be a big problem over 
here.’

Cards can be protected from RFID skimmers by being wrapped in tin foil or being kept in special foil-lined wallets.
