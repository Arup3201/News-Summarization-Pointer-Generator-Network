Buzz Lightyear looks ghoulish; the teacups take on a psychedelic life of their own and the Magic Kingdom is transformed into a dystopian hellhole.

This isn't a tetchy parent complaining of a long day of queues at Disney's Magic Kingdom but rather the description of a new film which is exciting the critics but causing some uproar in the 'Happiest Place on Earth'.

Randall Moore's, Escape from Tomorrow, a dark movie set among the backdrop of the Disney theme parks in Florida and California is all the talk of this year's Sundance Film Festival.

Legal action? Filmmakers behind a movie on show at the Sundance Film Festival could face a lawsuit from the Walt Disney Company blocking its release. The film was secretly filmed in Disney's parks without permission

Can't look: Disney are 'aware' of the film but not commenting on what they'll do. Backers of Escape From Tomorrow said they expected the company to try and block its release

However, if Walt Disney Company get in the way it may never be released.

The black and white film, which follows a man suffering a breakdown while on vacation with his wife and two children, was recorded entirely in secret across the tourist hotspots.

It is packed full of disturbing imagery as its protagonist slips into madness and is haunted by the park's ghoulish characters and vertigo inducing rides - a world away from the company's squeaky-clean corporate image.

Disney told CNN they were 'aware' of the film and were 'not currently commenting'. Film experts at the festival seemed agreed that Disney would likely take out a lawsuit.

If opposed and a block goes ahead audiences will miss out on film described by Hollywood Reporter as a ' bizarre, sophomoric, hallucinatory' and 'gutsy' film shot entirely undercover, which has attracted the critics with it's directional flair and eerie soundtrack.

Surreal: The film follows a father's dark mental breakdown while on vacation with his family at a theme park. The crew secretly recorded it in Disney World and Disneyland over 24 days without getting caught

Tourists: The film's cast mixed among the many tourists, left, visiting Disney's theme parks to avoid detection. They also had their scripts and directions on iPhones and mixed with the crowds during parades, right

'It took a lot of planning. We were careful and cautious and tried not to draw too much attention to ourselves. But planning was the main thing," the director told the festival after the film premiered last Friday.

'We almost got caught once. ... We were shooting in the entrance of the park and we had to do a few takes and basically they thought our team was just paparazzi and we were shooting a famous family (entering the park),'

'It was very scary that day.'

The director hid the microphone in his sock and he, the crew and his actors pretended to be tourists visiting the famous theme parks.

Buzz: Indie flick Escape from Tomorrow is the talk of this year's Sundance Film Festival

Spaced-out mountain: The film was described as a 'hallucinatory' by the Hollywood Reporter. It has been well-received by critics mostly impressed by the clandestine way it was shot

Unhappy holiday: The family in Escape from Tomorrow are thrown into an unusual vacation to the theme park when father, Jim, suffers a breakdown after finding out he has lost his job

They had scripts and directions on their iPhones so could appear they were casually glancing at their phones while preparing for each take and used SLR cameras to film the action

They managed to go undetected for ten days at Disney's theme parks in Orlando and two weeks Disneyland, California.

If Moore wants the film to go ahead, he may not be going the right way in winning around the corporation when discussing his 'inspiration'.

'Heavily influenced by various strange outings I endured as a boy with my father -- who at the time lived in Orlando, Florida -- 'Escape From Tomorrow' is my personal attempt to make sense of what felt like a very artificial childhood, brought on by our cultural obsession with these fake, manufactured worlds of so-called fantasy,' he said

Secretive: The crew, some pictured, led by Director Randall Moore, 1st left, recorded Escape from Tomorrow across Disneyland and Disney World over 24 days. They were almost caught once when mistaken as paparazzi

'I think the film is really about defining the word 'escape' and how so many American households seek it out in a yearly pilgrimage to a materialistic Mecca.'

It may well be that the small world is too small for both of them but not everyone at the festival is agreed Disney would win a legal challenge.

Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, told the L.A. Times: 'It's a film that falls 
pretty squarely in the territory of fair use, which addresses 
copyright. And to establish trademark infringement they'd have to prove that a 
reasonable person would think Disney is endorsing the movie, and I think
they'd have a hard time doing that.'
