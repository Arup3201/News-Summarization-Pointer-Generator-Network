It is a mammoth deal that secures his status as Liverpool's talisman for many years to come.

Raheem Sterling, at the age of 20, is about to put pen to paper on a staggering contract worth £25million over the next five years.

But where does the England star rank among the hottest young properties in the big European leagues? We count down our top 10.

10. Jetro Willems (PSV Eindhoven and Holland)

The most experienced member of our list, Willems was barely out of school when he started playing in the Eredivisie with Sparta Rotterdam.

A move to PSV Eindhoven proved a springboard for the 20-year-old left-back and he is now a regular for the Holland national team too.

Indeed, at 18 years and 71 days, he was the youngest player ever to feature at a European Championship finals in 2012.

9. Max Meyer (Schalke and Germany)

The latest absurdly talented attacking midfielder to come along the German conveyor belt, Meyer has inevitably drawn comparisons with Mario Gotze.

The Schalke man, 19, credits the close control and movement required in futsal, which he played as a youngster, for his progress.

Meyer is an important cog in the Schalke team and has 68 appearances for them, as well as a cap for Germany.

8. Ross Barkley (Everton and England)

Only 21, Barkley has established himself as a mainstay in the Everton team and as a regular for England too - and don't expect him to budge anytime soon.

The midfielder possesses that rare blend of strength, pace and technique that allows him to take games by the scruff of the neck and he's demonstrated that quality time after time.

He is closing in on 100 competitive Everton appearances and has won 10 caps for his country though there are suggestions a big-money move could be afoot.

7. Saul Niguez (Atletico Madrid and Spain)

Tipped to become the next great Spanish midfielder, Saul came through the ranks at Atletico Madrid having joined the club from neighbours Real aged 14.

But it was a loan spell at Rayo Vallecano last season that was the making of him and their better-than-expected 12th-place finish in La Liga was in no small part due to his influence.

Capped by Spain to Under 21 level, Saul is an uncompromising tackler with quick wits and a very good reading of the game.

6. Mateo Kovacic (Inter Milan and Croatia)

A man very much on the radar of the leading Premier League clubs, the versatile Croatian international Kovacic, 20, has already seen and done a great deal.

He played 73 times for his first club, Dinamo Zagreb, before arriving at San Siro in 2012 and has since clocked up 73 more games as an important member of the team.

His career has seen him flit between defensive and advanced midfield positions but with his accomplished dribbling and passing, he is adept at both roles.

5. Hakan Calhanoglu (Bayer Leverkusen and Turkey)

At the age of just 20, Calhanoglu is regarded as the best free-kick taker in Europe and he has certainly been illuminating the Bundesliga with his set-piece prowess.

He left struggling Hamburg for Bayer Leverkusen in the summer in a deal worth £12m and has already found the net seven times in both domestic and European competition.

Calhanoglu is so highly rated, Germany wanted him to represent them but he chose the country of his parents, Turkey, and has so far collected five caps.

4. Gerard Deulofeu (Sevilla, on loan from Barcelona, and Spain)

A young man who needs no introduction to Premier League fans following his highly impressive loan spell with Everton last season.

Deulofeu, 20, was shipped out again by Barcelona at the start of the summer - this time to Sevilla - but many were quick to question why Luis Enrique had not kept him.

His speed and direct style of attack mark Deulofeu, who can play on the wing or further forward, as an exciting player to watch.

3. Adrien Rabiot (Paris Saint-Germain and France)

One of the hottest properties on the continent, Rabiot is wanted by a host of top Premier League clubs after struggling to hold down a place in the PSG side.

It's a frustrating situation for the highly-regarded 19-year-old midfielder, whose command on the pitch, skill and incisive passing are more mature than his years.

Capped by France up to Under 21 standard, Rabiot is likely to make the step up if he can gain regular football, potentially in England.

2. Raheem Sterling (Liverpool and England)

Blessed with a magnetic touch and lightning pace, Sterling was a dynamic part of Liverpool's brush with Premier League title glory last season and is arguably English football's greatest hope for the future.

Still just 20, Sterling seems to have accomplished an awful lot already, with over 100 appearances and 18 goals for Liverpool, and 13 caps for his country.

And his achievements are being noticed - Sterling won the Golden Boy Award for the best young player in Europe last month.

1. Munir El Haddadi (Barcelona and Spain)

It's clear that Barcelona feel the time has come for Munir, their 19-year-old wonderkid, and they have used him in several matches this season.

As he had demonstrated time after time in Barcelona's youth ranks, the La Masia prodigy boasts fleet of foot, speed of thought, bags of confidence and a willingness to shoot at goal.

That is now being unleashed on defences in La Liga and the Champions League, with many glittering years likely to be ahead of him.
