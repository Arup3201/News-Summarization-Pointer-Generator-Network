Brendan Rodgers is prepared to push Liverpool’s search for a new striker to the last minute of the transfer window as he scours Europe for candidates of the highest calibre.

When Liverpool wrap up the formalities of Alberto Moreno’s £12million move from Sevilla, Rodgers will have brought eight new faces in this summer but he still has one key area that he needs to fill.

Having missed out on Loic Remy because of complications over his medical, Rodgers and his recruitment team have been discussing a number of names, including Samuel Eto’o, who is a free agent, and Monaco’s Radamel Falcao.

Waiting game: Brendan Rodgers will continue his search for striker right up until the final day

Denied! Liverpool came close to signing Loic Remy before the Newcastle striker failed a medical

Liverpool had initially accepted that signing Falcao would be difficult, given they had understood that Real Madrid were his chosen option, but they have not given up hope of possibly taking the Colombian before the window closes.

There are other options being considered and Rodgers is hoping his search will be productive. Should he fail to find a suitable target, though, Liverpool’s manager is adamant that his squad has enough depth.

‘We just want to complete on Moreno so we have covered both full back positions and if we can get a striker on top of that, it will be it,’ said Rodgers. ‘It’s not easy, but we have to keep looking.

‘We certainly need something that is going to help us over the coming season. You never know sometimes you just never know happens with a few weeks to go in the window.

Colombian connection? Liverpool have been linked with an audacious move for Radamel Falcao

‘That last week, the window will always throw up something. We will just persevere, and the boys are working hard behind the scenes to see what information we can get on the availability of players and we will take it from there.’

Liverpool will have to adjust to not having brilliance of Luis Suarez this season but, as he prepares for Sunday’s opening fixture with Southampton, Rodgers feels his squad are better prepared for the campaign compared to how they were 12 months ago.

‘We haven’t just brought in a ton of players without thought,’ said Rodgers. ‘These are players who will be integrated into the squad, at 22, 20, and 19 that can play now and that can also be here for the future. The aim is to ensure this club is sustainable and that means on and off the field.

Blues brother? A move for former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o would be a cheaper option

‘For us this year we are better equipped because of the depth of the squad. I see it in the training, young players they give energy to senior players and give that enthusiasm and I look in the training and it has given some of the older players that nudge as well. That’s been great to see.’
