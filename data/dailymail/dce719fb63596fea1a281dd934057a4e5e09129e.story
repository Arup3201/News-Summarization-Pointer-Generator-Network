A couple who murdered a transvestite in order to claim his benefit money and left him to rot in a suitcase in their bathroom have been jailed for life for murder.

Big Issue sellers Tracey Hurrell, 32, and David Hardman, 51, were told at Preston Crown Court they must serve a minimum of 23 years.

Their victim Lionel Morl, 49, who was known locally as 'Susie' and wore women's clothes, false breasts and wigs was stabbed and beaten to death before being stuffed into the suitcase.

Big Issue sellers Tracey Hurrell, left, and David Hardman, right, were today jailed for life for the brutal murder of Lionel Morl. The couple left the body of their victim in a suitcase for weeks after he was killed.

But when police officers visited the flat on an unrelated matter they failed to inspect the case despite spotting it covered in a sleeping bag, saying it did 'not look out of place' in a house so strewn with rubbish.

And despite the fact they noticed that Hurrell was said to be 'tetchy and agitated' and Hardman had glazed eyes during their visit, they failed to raise the alarm.

The corpse was not discovered until ten days later in August last year when police officers went to a neighbouring address and noticed a 'terrible smell' coming from the property in Openshaw, Manchester.

Hardman, who was a tenant at the address, then tried to pass off the smell as coming from an abscess on his foot.

The couple were both known addicts - with Hurrell a heroin and crack cocaine user, and Hardman drinking up to seven litres of cider a day.

Gut wrenching photos of the flat show kitchen tops strewn with empty bottles of cider and spirits and piles of washing up and the lounge and bedrooms festooned with dumped clothing, bedding, books and paint pots.

Hurrell initially lived with Hardman but then befriended Morl who lived in a neighbouring street before moving into his house after claiming she was homeless.

Shortly afterwards she began bullying Morl, and on one occasion threatened him with a knife before he asked her to leave.

She and Hardman then began preying on Morl for his benefit money and the victim's post office card - which Morl had used to withdraw his fortnightly invalidity benefit of £200 - went missing.

The card was used by the couple to withdraw £190 from Morl's account.

It is believed Morl was attacked when he returned from a friend's house to his flat to collect his  glasses.

The killers were later seen pulling a wheeled suitcase near to the house.

Andrew Thomas QC, prosecuting, said WPCs Maria Campbell and Louse Macfarlane initially visited Hardman's flat but did not believe there was anything suspicious.

Mr Thomas said: 'The flat was cluttered with junk. The officers saw the suitcase and by that stage it was in the flat in the bathroom under a sleeping bag. But there was no significant smell. 

'The officers did not check the contents of the suitcase and eventually they left.'

WPC Campbell told the jury she and her colleague often visited properties that smelt bad and were untidy.

She told the court: 'Because the flat was in such a terrible state it didn't appear out of place to have a sleeping bag and suitcase in the bathroom.'

After returning days later to the property, however, PC John Sutcliffe told the hearing the stench of the body was undeniable: 'The smell became increasingly worse.

Both Hardman and Hurrell denied murder and blamed each other for the killing

'It's a smell I recognise and it was very, very strong now.

'I cut the corner of the suitcase with my pocket knife and it revealed what I could see to be a human foot and what I thought was the side of a head.'

Hurrell and Hardman were both subsequently arrested.

A post-mortem examination showed that Lionel had died following a violent attack in which he had been stabbed and beaten. It is estimated he had been dead for about two weeks.

Hardman and Hurrell both denied murder - blaming each other for the killing. The couple were also both convicted of perverting the course of justice

Senior Investigating Officer, Andy Tattersall of Greater Manchester Police said after the case: 'Hurrell and Hardman were both dependent on alcohol and drugs and went to desperate lengths to obtain cash to fund their habits.

'This is reflected in the theft of Lionel's benefits before and after they killed him. Each blames the other for what happened and both have fabricated different stories so we might never know exactly what happened and why.

'What we do know is that from start to finish, they worked together: in stealing Lionel's benefits, in his violent murder and in trying to hide his body.'
