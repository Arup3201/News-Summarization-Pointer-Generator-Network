As Shoshanna Shapiro in TV series Girls actress Zosia Mamet is used to dressing in prim, pretty dresses and twee accessories.

Now the 25-year-old has revealed an edgier side to her style as the star of the latest edition of ASOS magazine.

Brunette Zosia moved from LA to New York when filming started on the HBO show, now in its third series, and she admits that she has fallen in love with the city as she poses around gritty areas of Brooklyn for the fashion spread.

She says: 'I was incredibly lonely and I moved seven times during that first 
season’s filming. Then, during the second season, I fell in love with 
the city and suddenly it became easy and wonderful – it really is like 
no other place in the world.'

Zosia, who has a reputation as a style maven, is seen in this season's over-sized coats, trainers and crop tops.

When the cameras stop rolling it seems she is a girl that enjoys dressing down in: 'I’m not a girl who is going to put something on that I can’t breathe in
 or walk in or sit down in, I don’t see the point I like something I 
feel good in, that feels ‘me.'

Girls is the American's biggest role to date and the daughter of playwright and director David Mamet is, of course, delighted to be part of the show that everyone is talking about.

She says: 'I love every single aspect of being on the show…I have the most fun job
 in the world. And Lena (Dunham) – I don’t know if I’ve worked with someone who 
has so much responsibility but is so calm. She is just one of the 
coolest, most collected humans I’ve ever met…that’s an incredible 
example to learn from.

'She made a story about kids in their early 20s, in an unglamorous way. It was full throttle, didn’t pull punches, and wasn’t afraid to make things uncomfortable.

'It’s entertaining and funny, but also dark and sad and unabashed and unapologetic,. I think people feel they can really relate to it – like she was telling their story.'
