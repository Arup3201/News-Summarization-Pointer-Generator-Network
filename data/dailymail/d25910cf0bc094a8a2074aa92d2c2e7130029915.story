In late November, Marcy Glanz was hit with some awful news: after battling with ovarian cancer for nearly three years, her doctors told her she had but a few weeks to live.

With just a few, short weeks left on earth, Ms. Glanz didn't succumb to self-pity or fear - rather, she used her remaining days to essentially have a month-long farewell party, during which she could say her goodbyes to the scores of friends she made in her 62 years on earth.

'Many of us die too soon and have no chance to say goodbye, or we have a
 long, ugly painful demise,' her husband, Marion Stewart, said. 'Hers was
 neither of those.'

The end: Glanz died on January 5 in her 90th Street apartment surrounded by her family

Glanz's final days are recounted in a lengthy piece in the New York Times, which describes her desires for her final weeks as wanting 'a monthlong farewell party that mixed frivolity and friendship, laughter and tears.'

Ms. Glanz got her wish.

'She very quickly made peace with the fact that she was going to die in a
 few weeks and that she would use that time to say goodbye,' her husband told the paper, 
adding that this was not an easy task for a woman who'd amassed as many friends as his wife.

Rather than spend her final weeks in a hospital or hospice, Ms. Glanz was able to remain in her home on West 90th Street in Manhattan, where a medical staff was brought in to give her the care she needed as she prepared to lay down her arms in her long battle against cancer.

Ms. Glanz - who had a master's degree in educational psychology from Harvard - spent much of December sharing memories with her family in the forms of old pictures and home movies.

Mr. Stewart notes that while there was some crying as he, his wife and their two sons remembered happier times, 'but there was a lot more laughing than crying.'

'We did many of the things that people do after death, but we 
did it before she died,' he says.

Ms. Glanz even helped plan her own memorial service, giving her husband specific instructions on everything down to the music and speakers.

'There was no "Woe is me" or "I can’t stand this,’” he said. 'There was just a peacefulness and wanting to wrap everything up.'

One of Ms. Glanz's biggest regrets was that her unfortunate death would mean she would never meet her grandchildren. So, in preparation, her sons brought her a copy of Goodnight Moon - the same book she used to read to them before they went to sleep - and she recorded herself reading it so her future grandchildren could hear her voice and be 'tucked in by the grandmother they never met.'

Another of Ms. Glanz's concerns was who would take care of her husband, as many of her longtime friends confided to Mr. Stewart after her passing. In many cases, all she asked of her friends was that they promised to look after the man she'd spent her life with.

She couldn’t even eat, yet she told me she was really, really happy to 
be able to help her family deal with the loss before she was gone.

'She couldn’t even eat, yet she told me she was really, really happy to 
be able to help her family deal with the loss before she was gone,' friend Catherine Paura told the paper.

As her health continued to deteriorate, Ms. Glanz was bound to a wheelchair by the time her 62nd birthday rolled around on December 24. But that didn't stop her from having not one but three parties to celebrate her abbreviated life.

On New Year's Eve, Ms. Glanz decided that she wanted to have 'one last blowout party' at the apartment she shared with her husband.

She invited 20 people and made toasts with ginger ale as she worked the room wearing a pink, fuzzy boa. 

The next day - New Year's Day - was the last day Ms. Glanz could speak. She died on January 5 - in her bed and surrounded by her family.

'She had the ability and wherewithal to say everything she wanted to say,' Ms. Paura said. 'It was as if, by facing her death through the prism of love she transcended it.'
