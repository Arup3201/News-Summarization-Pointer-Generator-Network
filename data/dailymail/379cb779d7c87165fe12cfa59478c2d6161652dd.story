Two amateur athletes proved age is nothing but a number when they went head-to-head in the final of a 60m race at the European Veterans' Athletics Championships.

Polish Sportsman, Stanislaw Kowalski, 104, participated in this week's event against London's 95-year-old Charles Eugster.

The race was held indoors in Torun, Poland and was won by Mr Eugster in an impressive time of 14.56 seconds.

Mr Kowalski has never had professional training, but spent the majority of his life walking or cycling to work

Mr Kowalski – who holds the record for being the oldest person in Europe to run the 100m dash in 32.79 seconds – finished the race in a time of 20.27 seconds.

Born in Swidnica, Poland in 1910, Mr Kowalski started running 13 years ago and puts his health and fitness down to  doing whatever he pleases and never going to the doctor.

Mr Eugster, who only took up the sport of running a year ago, recently broke the world 200m indoor sprint record for those aged 95 and above.

Mr Kowalski and Mr Eugster completed the race in 20.27 seconds and 14.56 seconds, respectively

Footage from the event shows Mr Kowalski stretching, swinging his arms and doing some light jogging as he warms up with his trainer.

He says: ‘Sure, I run as much as possible, 100m and 200m and 1000m.'

Lining up alongside his competitor, he awaits the starting pistol before the pair spring into action and run the length of the track to complete the race.

Mr Kowalski has never had any professional training, but spent the majority of his life walking or cycling six miles to work.

He claims he only took running up as a hobby when he was 92, and has jobbed six miles every day for the last few years.
