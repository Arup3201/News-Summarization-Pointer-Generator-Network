Two men have been arrested in New Jersey on charges that they took part in kidnapping an Orthodox Jewish husband to force him to grant his wife a religious divorce.

The thugs beat him and shocked him with a stun gun on his fingers and genitals.

David Aryeh Epstein, 39, and Chaim Baruch Rubin, 32, of Lakewood are charged with kidnapping.

Like father, like son: Last year Rabbi Mendel Epstein was arrested for allegedly offering to kidnap and torture husbands so they'd grant their wives divorces. Now his son, David Aryeh Epstein, 39, is accused of the exact same thing

Epstein is the son of Mendel Epstein, a 68-year-old Brooklyn rabbi who was accused of similar charges last fall.

According to court documents unsealed Thursday, the uncooperative husband in the most recent case was also engaged in a contested divorce.

During the summer of 2009, the husband separated from his wife and moved out of the family’s  Brooklyn home.

In November of the same year, as the victim walked to his car one evening after staying late at work, he was attacked by a group of men, the complaint says.

The two suspects then abducted the husband dragging him into a van, bound with duct tape and zip ties before being brutally beaten and shocked with a stun gun.

They they used an electric cattle prod on his genitals until he granted his estranged wife a Jewish divorce.

Investigation: The arrests come after a lengthy investigation that started more than two years ago in the ultra-Orthodox community in Lakewood, New Jersey

Under Orthodox Jewish law, a wife cannot get a religious divorce unless the husband agrees to give her a 'get,' a document she needs for the divorce to go through.

The men told the husband they 'were willing to do whatever needed to be done,' according to the affidavit, including breaking his bones.

To show they were serious, they used a cattle prod to shock the husband's fingers and genitals.

At some point during the beating, Rubin got in the front seat of the van.

In January, the victim saw a photo of David Epstein and identified him as one of the men who attacked him.

The complaint says a rabbi pointed a video camera at the victim, telling him to repeat the words needed for a get.

After the victim refused, the driver began stomping on the victim until he agreed.

The husband 'relented and recited the words as directed by the rabbi,' according to court documents.

The victim, no longer religiously married, was driven to another location and tossed from the van. After finding his way to a house nearby, he called for help.

He was taken to a local emergency room where he was treated for broken ribs, a bruised spine and other injuries.

If convicted, the defendants face a maximum potential penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Charged: David Aryeh Epstein, 39, and Chaim Baruch Rubin, 32, of Lakewood are charged with kidnapping

Both men appeared Thursday in federal court in Trenton and were released on $500,000 bail with home detention and electronic monitoring.

David Epstein's father, Mendel Epstein, was charged in October 2013 with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, along with nine other people, accused of plotting to kidnap and torture an Orthodox Jewish man to force a religious divorce.

Mendel and David Epstein were also implicated in the May 6 guilty plea of David Wax to similar charges. Wax, 51, of Lakewood pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to commit kidnapping in a 2010 case, authorities said.

The
 arrests come after a lengthy investigation that started more than two 
years ago in the ultra-Orthodox community in Lakewood, New Jersey.

Only Orthodox men can initiate divorce - not their wives
