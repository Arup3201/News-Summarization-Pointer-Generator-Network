A playboy Saudi prince with multi-billion pound investments in Britain was today named as the royal robbed by a Kalashnikov-wielding gang in Paris.

Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd, 41, was the victim of a movie-style heist at Porte de la Chapelle, in the north of the French capital on Sunday night.

His 10-car convoy, including cars full of armed bodyguards, was on the way towards a private jet at Le Bourget airport when it was attacked.

In what looked like a crime involving inside knowledge, around eight balaclava-wearing thugs forced the lead car to a halt, pointing their guns at their victims.

They then made off with a Mercedes van containing more than £200,000 in cash, along with a case full of documents, and medication belonging to the Prince.

The Prince, who had just spent almost two months living in a luxury suite at the Four Seasons George V Hotel in Paris, was in a separate chauffeur-driven car. Nobody was injured in the raid.

The gang's getaway BMW cars and the Mercedes were later found burnt out nearby, while three of the Prince's kidnapped aides were released.

Sources at Le Bourget confirmed that the Prince was on his way to a jet from the Saudi Arabian embassy in Paris.

Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd's investments in London include a share in Heron Tower in the City of London, and he is said to have a £4 billion property portfolio in the USA alone.

He once left a £60,000 tip during a visit to a trendy restaurant on the Spanish island of Ibiza, and offered a mansion for sale in Kensington Palace Gardens, the so-called 'Billionaire's Row' in west London, for £100million last year.

Following the raid, security was stepped up around the royal in Paris, where the authorities have become increasingly concerned about a spate of car-jackings of the super-rich.

Billionaires from the Middle East, Russia and China are well known for offering cash for discounts on items like cars and jewelry - making them particularly vulnerable to attack.

A source at the Saudi embassy in Paris said that Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd remained 'shocked but otherwise OK' following his ordeal, and was now believed to be back in Ibiza on holiday.
