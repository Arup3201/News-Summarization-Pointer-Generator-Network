Self starter: At 13 James Kosta was already making $1,500 a month as an IT consultant

For software developer James Kosta, life has played virtually like a video game, with a new character on every level.

From parental divorcee to computer hacker, convicted criminal to Navy intelligence analyst, CIA agent to multimillionaire - the 37-year-old knows how to role-play.

At 13 he was already earning $1,500 a month as an IT consultant. He even managed to persuade his school to let him 'formalise the computer club' and run his business from there.

With an 18-year-old girlfriend, 
pockets full of cash and friends aplenty he began skipping school and 
staying out late into the night.

Then his parents issued him with an ultimatum: If he wanted to live under their roof he had to give it all up and focus on school.

'I went to court and proved to a judge I was responsible enough to be on my own,' he told theÂ Huffington Post.

Alone and with nobody to reign him in, he turned his knack for computers into low-level hacking.

But
his solo activities soon caught the attentions of the online criminal
underworld and he was swiftly recruited into a criminal hacking collective.

He and his accomplices began hacking the sites of big business and military, including the systems of major banks, General Electric and IBM. For this 14-year-old nothing was out of bounds.

Then
early one morning there was a bang on the door. Naked and bleary eyed, 
Kosta answered and was bundled to the ground by an FBI tactical squad armed 
with MP-5 sub-machine guns.

'I
was terrified. When you're that young, because your parents always give
you warnings, you expect someone to say, hey, knock it off. I never 
expected any action like that.'

And because he was now divorced from his parents, he was officially a 14-year-old adult.

Off the rails: Kosta soon earned a reputation in the online criminal underworld and was recruited into a feared hacking collective infiltrating the sites of big business and military (stock image)

He
was found guilty of 45 counts of technical burglary and sentenced to 45 years in jail.

But he says the judge saw a spark inside the troubled and neglected child and decided to give him a chance of atonement.

After a year in juvenile detention, he was released on a suspended sentence and offered a spot in the military on the condition that he would not commit another crime.

'For me, it was a no-brainer,' he says. 'I knew if I went to maximum security for youth, a guy like me probably wouldn't have a good experience.'

Langley, Virginia, CIA HQ: By the age of 20, Kosta was working for the CIA tracking money wired between warlords and radical sheiks in North Africa and the Middle East

As soon as he was eligible, he joined the Navy and was swiftly stationed in the intelligence division, responsible for tracking money wired between warlords and radical sheiks in North Africa and the Middle East.

From there he was drafted into 'penetration testing on military installations', in some of the first stages of technological warfare.

However, by the late 1990s, it began to dawn on Kosta that he wanted to make more of his life than propping up the establishment and  started one of the first commercial websites focused on financial markets with his brother. In 1999 they sold it for tens of millions of dollars.

Passion for games: After 9/11 he designed a computer simulation for the CIA to imitate 'Las Vegas getting hit with a dirty bomb' using a game engine by the company that developed Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon (pictured)

But the draw of the Government dollar pulled him back after 9/11 and he designed a military computer simulation to imitate 'Las Vegas getting hit with a dirty bomb and how rescuers could lock down the city'

He had such fun with the simulation game, based on a game engine by the company that developed Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, that he decided to focus all his powers on making virtual worlds.

He says the draw of interactive entertainment is 'allowing people to create their own worlds [...] like watching ants from above'.

Now Kosta runs game development firm  3G Studios Inc, a company that turns over more than $10 million a year.

'I was an intelligent, rebellious youth, but my grades and attendance 
records weren't the sole indicators for my potential contribution to 
society,' he says. 'Ultimately, society suffers when we're that myopic [but] when you 
look a little deeper, as people did with me, you're able to get kids 
focused on their potential.'

His company also works closely with 'troubled youth', mentoring teens to help them find their way to engage because 'that's something I owe to the people who helped me.'
