Controversial: Bollywood star Sherlyn Chopra, 28, will be the first Indian woman to appear nude in Playboy

A Bollywood actress has been accused of shaming her country by becoming the first Indian woman to appear naked in Playboy.

Sherlyn Chopra, 28, will star in the magazine's November issue after she wrote to Playboy asking to strip for them.

Speaking to BBC Hindi, the actress admitted she found it a difficult challenge.

The actress, who has played a number of roles in Bollywood films, said: 'It is not an easy task to be nude in front of the camera and look good at the same time.'

Ms Chopra's appearance in the magazine is already proving controversial in India.

Although Playboy is banned in the country, people can still get access to it from the internet.

‘She’s not hot, she’s repulsive,’ said one critic on Twitter.

And some Indian columnists have 
attacked Playboy’s billing of Miss Chopra as a ‘Bollywood legend’, 
pointing out that she has had only minor roles.

‘At a time when innocent women across
the nation from Gujarat to Guwahati have been subjected to sexual abuse
and humiliation, one wonders if Sherlyn Chopra’s pictures wound a 
woman’s integrity,’ said commentator Gayatri Sankar.

Unabashed, Miss Chopra has hinted that her next step may be into sex films.

She said India’s youth ‘is racing 
towards liberalisation, and that’s why being unconventional in your 
choices is no longer a taboo’.

But despite the possibly difficulties she may face, Ms Chopra is proud of what she has done.

'I have become the first Indian to pose naked for Playboy and nobody can take away that achievement from me,' she said.

'My sister is proud of my achievement.'

But she admitted shes hadn't yet told her mother about her latest role.

For her shoot Ms
Chopra went to the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles where she met the 
magazine's founder Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends.

And she was inspired
by what she saw.

'I am thinking of making him my idol because he lives his life on his terms and conditions,' she said.

The magazine, which features 
photographs of nude women, as well as fiction and journalism, was 
founded in Chicago in 1953 by Mr Hefner.

It is one of the world's best known brands, although it is banned in many parts of Asia.

Over
the years it has featured some of the world's best known women, 
including Bond girl Ursula Andress, Kim Basinger and, in January, 
Lindsay Lohan.
