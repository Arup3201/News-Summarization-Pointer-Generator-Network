Nemanja Vedic and Yuto Magatomo scored as Inter Milan beat AS Roma 2-0 Saturday.

Inter broke the deadlock just moments before halftime. On a free kick from the left outside of the box, Dodo's left-footed service found Vedic at the center of the penalty box and his deflected header found the top corner.

Roma almost tied it in the 48th minute, but Mattia Destro's header barely missed. Nagatomo provided insurance in the 69th minute as he collected a loose ball in the right side of the box and buried it past Skorupski in the top right corner.

Trademark: Nemanja Vidic opened the scoring with a towering header into the far corner

Great start: It was the former Manchester United captain's first goal for his new club

Ashley Cole was in action for Rudi Garcia's side, but was unable to prevent the defeat. 

Inter finished the International Champions Cup group stage with six points, two points behind Manchester United.

All over: Yuto nagatomo is congratulated by team-mates after his strike
