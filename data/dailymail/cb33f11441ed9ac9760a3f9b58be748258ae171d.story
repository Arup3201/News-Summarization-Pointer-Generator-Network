A woman with a neck tattoo was made to cover up her ink before being allowed to enter a casino.

Bianka Roggensack went to Jupiter's Casino, on the Gold Coast in Queensland,on Saturday night for her sister's 21st birthday but the celebrations were dampened before the party even began. 

The Palm Beach tattooist said it was the first time she had encountered discrimination against her body art, even though she has at least 20 tattoos. She's had her neck creation for the past five years.

Bianka said tattoos don't reflect the person inside

'I was asked to step to one side and then told I couldn't be let in because my neck tattoo  was exposed,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I read the entry conditions out the front and there was no mention of tattoos so I asked the security guard and he said the policy was only made about two months ago and the sign hadn't been changed in that time.'

Her sister was naturally disappointed that Bianka wasn't allowed in so she asked if there was any way she could be allowed to enter.

'They said that only if I managed to cover it by wrapping a scarf around my neck or putting makeup on it,' she said.

'So we went to my other sister's car and we smothered it all with makeup.'

Bianka said she wasn't given an explanation for the rule banning face tattoos.

'I said to them "what about the tattoos exposed on my fingers, hands and arms?" but that didn't seem to matter,' she said.

'They also said for future reference that the coverage has to be maintained throughout the night.

'What if I'm dancing and it sweats off?'

When Daily Mail Australia asked Jupiters Casino why the policy was implemented they declined to respond but provided the following statement.

'Jupiters Hotel & Casino confirmed the property has a tattoo policy, which is part of its broader dress code policy.'

The tattoo has great sentimental value for Bianka because it was done when her mother was diagnosed with an incurable form of cancer

The tattoo has great sentimental value for Bianka, as she decided to get the design on her neck at the time her mother was diagnosed with an incurable type of cancer five years ago. 

Reflecting broadly on her experiences, she said: 'I don't think tattoos reflect the quality of a person at all.

'Why should it then reflect on my standing within society that I chose to remember my mother with a portrait?' 

The 26-year-old said she was very embarrassed by the incident at the casino and is struggling to make sense of the incident. 

'We live in a country that supports and encourages people to be themselves, be individuals and to be an accepting society compared to a lot of places in the world.' 

She said that although she has never been judged for her tattoos she was aware that discrimination was not an uncommon experience for tattooed people.

'It's a hot topic in the studio - why should people be refused coffees, lunches and manicures because they have tattoos?' she said.

'If people are tattooed or not doesn't make any difference to me.' 

Bianka now has so many tattoos that she has lost count but predicts it would be at least 20 pieces of body art
