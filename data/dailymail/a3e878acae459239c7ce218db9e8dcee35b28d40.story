Shahab Reza, who is deaf, has admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions out of thousands of pounds by falsely claiming benefits for sign language interpreters

A deaf man and his family falsely claimed £800,000 for sign language interpreters in a 'dishonest and greedy' benefits scam, a court has heard.

Shahab Reza, of Perivale, west London,  submitted fake invoices to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) but used the money to fund holidays, jewellery and university fees, prosecutors say.

The 51-year-old and his wife, Shehnaz Reza, both of whom are deaf, also involved their children, Zainab Reza, 22, and Abbas Reza, 26, it is claimed.

Father Shahab, 51, has admitted his role in the swindle and is facing years behind bars.

Mother Shehnaz and children Zainab and Abbas all deny being part of a conspiracy.

Southwark Crown Court heard Shahab masterminded a four-year scam by submitting fake invoices for sign language interpreters to the DWP through the Access to Work scheme.

Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said: 'This case concerns dishonesty and greed that started with Shabab Reza, who has acknowledged his dishonesty by pleading guilty to every count that he faced on the indictment.

'He was assisted by his wife, Shehnaz Reza and his children, Abbas and Zainab Reza, to obtain taxpayers' money through sophisticated frauds at the heart of the benefits system.

'Shahab Reza is deaf and so is his wife. They... pretended that they required the assistance of British Sign Language interpreters and Support Workers dishonestly, to obtain grants from the Access to Work Scheme, operated by the Department for Work and Pensions.

'Approximately £800,000 was paid into bank accounts controlled by members of the Reza family. It was spent on property and jewellery, holidays and investments.'

She added: 'Many thousands of pounds were obtained through this simple, but clever fraud.

'Housing benefit was paying for the family home and the children's day-to-day expenses were met by grants and bursaries. There was money to spend.

'In order to be able to spend the money it needed to appear to come from legitimate business income.

'The Reza family set about laundering the money through accounts in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the UK.'

The family spent the money on property in Dubai, a new luxury family home and £600,000 penthouse apartment, the court heard.

Prosecutors said that when the alleged fraudsters were arrested there was thousands of pounds worth of gold jewellery and gems in a safe at their house, as well as a £8,000 diamond.

The court heard Shahab also lied about his family's financial circumstances to Harrow Council, netting nearly £100,000 in benefits and tax exemptions between June 2002 and August 2010.

The Reza family is also accused of conning the NHS and the Student Loans Company, with Abbas allegedly receiving a fraudulent bursary.

Ms Cottage told the court: 'Shahab and Shehnaz Reza also told lies to the claim Housing and Council Tax benefit to pay for the family home.

'The overpayment of this benefit amounted to some £100,000. Shahab Reza and his children also carried out frauds to top up their student income when Abbas and Zainab were at university and when Abbas was studying medicine.

'These frauds were perpetrated against the Student Loans Company and the NHS Bursary Scheme, both of which exists to assist those with few means.

'The ease with which these frauds were perpetrated is scandalous; the extend of the Reza family's greed and ability to lie is breathtakingly arrogant.'

Mother Shehnaz, 53, and her children Abbas and Zainab, each deny conspiracy to defraud.

They accept that a scam took place but claim they were 'doing what they were told' and did not realise that the documents they signed were important, the court heard.

Shehnaz Reza further denies single counts of fraud by false representation, obtaining money transfer by deception and dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability.

Zainab denies a further count of fraud by false representation, while Abbas denies two counts of fraud by false representation.

Shahab Reza admitted conspiracy to defraud, two counts of obtaining money transfer by deception, two counts of dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability, and three counts of fraud by false representation.

Four deaf friends of the family - Saifur Rahman, 31, Ahsan Naseer, 29, Natela Babina, 30, and Daiva Alisauskaite, 42 - are also on trial, accused of being part of a swindle.

Naseer, of Birmingham, Babina, of Wembley, north west London, Alisauskaite, of Hackney, east London, and Rahman, of Camden, north London, all deny conspiracy to defraud the Department of Work and Pensions.

The trial at Southwark Crown Court in London, which is expected to last two months, continues.
