David Cameron has insisted there is no way Abu Qatada will be allowed to return to Britain.

His comments come after Jordan's state security court acquitted the 53-year-old radical Muslim cleric of a charge of conspiring 
to commit acts of terrorism in the country.

Speaking after the decision, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘He can’t come back and he won’t come back. He’s a Jordanian, he does not have a UK passport, he was deported on an indefinite deportation order, he would not be granted permission to enter the UK, end of story.'

Qatada, who was extradited from 
Britain after a lengthy legal process, will continue to be held in a Jordanian prison until at least September due to 
separate charges in an adjourned trial, which relates to an alleged plot to attack tourists during Jordan's 
Millennium celebrations.

Radical: Abu Qatada (pictured in court today) has previously been described in courts as a senior al-Qaeda figure in Europe who had close ties to Osama bin Laden

Acquitted: Abu Qatada, real name Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, has been on trial since last summer for allegedly plotting two attacks against Westerners in Jordan

Referring to concerns Abu Qatada may return to the UK if he is also acquitted of his second charge, the
 Prime Minister's spokesman said: 'Mr Qatada was put on a plane to Jordan
 and is not coming back. This is a man the British courts have deemed a 
risk to national security. He is not coming back'.

Abu Qatada, real name Omar Mahmoud 
Mohammed Othman, has been on trial since last summer for allegedly plotting two attacks against Israelis, 
Americans and other Westerners in the country.

As he was living in Britain at the time, Jordan originally convicted Bethlehem-born Abu Qatada in his absence for the two plots and sentenced to life in prison.

Following a near decade-long legal process, which cost British taxpayers millions of pounds,the father-of-five was finally extradited last July.

On his arrival in Amman after being 
deported, Jordanian prosecutors charged Abu Qatada with 
conspiring to carry out two terror attacks in Jordan.

One of these charges was for a foiled plot against the American school in the Jordanian capital in 1999, while the other was the alleged targetting of Israeli and American tourists and Western diplomats during Jordan's Millennium celebrations.

Retrial: Although Jordan previously sentenced Abu Qatada to life in prison in his absence, the country's law required him to be retried once he returned

Not free: Abu Qatada will continue to be held at Mawaqqar 1 prison in Jordan (pictured) due to separate charges related to a plot to attack tourists during the country's Millennium celebrations

The conspiracy charge of which Abu 
Qatada has now been acquitted by a panel of civilian judges at the State
 Security Court in Amman relates to the alleged 1999 school plot.

The trial for the 2000 charge has now been adjourned until September.

Abu Qatada has been previously been described in courts as a senior al-Qaeda figure in Europe who had close ties to Osama bin Laden. 

Britain has
 accused him of links with Zacarias Moussaoui - the only person charged 
in the United States over the September 11 attacks - and with shoe bomber
 Richard Reid.

Today Nick Clegg said the Government would fight any attempt by Abu Qatada to return to Britain.

The Deputy Prime Minister insisted the Government had been right to battle for his deportation and declared 'we don't want this man back'.

He told radio station LBC: 'What is absolutely clear to me is this man needed to face justice and needed to do so out of the United Kingdom and that's what this government finally achieved.'

Asked if Britain would do everything possible to stop Qatada's return, Mr Clegg replied: 'Of course. We don't want this man back.'

On his way: Following a lengthy legal process, which cost British taxpayers millions of pounds, Abu Qatada was finally extradited last July

Long stay: Abu Qatada and his family moved to Britain in 1993 and were granted asylum the following year. While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000. He was finally extradited in 2013

Qatada was finally deported from Britain last July after a near-decade long battle to boot him out that cost nearly £2 million.

Once dubbed Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, Abu Qatada repeatedly used human rights laws to avoid removal from the UK.

He was finally flown to Jordan after the state gave formal assurances about how he would be treated.

Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'Abu Qatada's re-trial in Jordan has been made possible thanks to this government's determination to successfully deport him from the UK.'

'While the courts in Jordan have acquitted Qatada of one of the two charges against him, it is right the due process of law is allowed to take place in his own country. We await a verdict on the remaining charge,' he added.

'The UK courts agreed that Qatada posed a threat to national security in the UK, so we are pleased that we were able to remove him. He is subject to a deportation order which means he will be unable to return to the UK,' he went on to say.

Abu Qatada was born in the West Bank city of Bethlehem in 1960, which was under the control of Jordan at the time.

At the age of 29 he moved to Peshawar in Pakistan to teach about Sharia law, before moving to Kuwait.

In 1991 - after the Gulf War - he was kicked out the country along with other Palestinians and returned to Jordan.

Influence: From his home in North London, Abu Qatada was considered the 'in-house' adviser to radical groups around the world, and the 'spritual leader' of al-Qaeda in Europe

Two years later Qatada and his family applied for asylum in the UK, claiming he had been tortured in Jordan. This application was granted in June 1994.

In the late 1990s Qatada came to MI5's attention as his sermons became more extreme and his influence increased.

From his home in North London, he was later described as the 'in-house' adviser to radical groups around the world.

In 1999 and 2000 Qatada was convicted his absence and given a life sentence in Jordan for the two alleged terror plots for which he has been standing trial.

Qatada was arrested in the UK for the first time following the September 11 attacks, but was not charged with any crime.

He was repeatedly linked with extremist groups over the subsequent decade.

Agreement: The European Court of Human Rights finally allowed Abu Qatada to be extradited after receiving assurances from King Abdullah II of Jordan (pictured with David Cameron) that he would not be tortured

Mr Justice Collins, then chairman of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said he was 'heavily involved, indeed was at the centre' of al-Qaeda's UK activities, calling him 'a truly dangerous individual.'

While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000.

The campaign to extradite Qatada to face the terror conspiracy Jordan began in 2007, but was continually delayed by claims he would be tortured on his return.

After initially barring the UK deporting Qatada, the European Court of Human Rights finally denied him leave to appeal in 2012 after receiving assurances from Jordan that he would not be tortured.

Qatada finally left the UK to face trial the following July.
