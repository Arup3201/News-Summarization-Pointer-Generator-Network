A model student who had been dabbling in drugs hanged herself after worrying about her A-level exams, an inquest has heard.

The body of Amy Latham was found in woodland near to her home in Wimborne, Dorset, 36 hours after she left a note for her parents telling them not to bother looking for her.

The 18-year-old had sat her exams in English, biology and chemistry in the days prior to her disappearance.

The inquest heard Amy, who had got mostly A grades in her GCSEs two years previously, started suffering from depression in April this year, two months before her death on June 30.

Detective Inspector Joe Williams, from Dorset Police, told the inquest: 'Amy had been concerned about her A-levels which she had just taken at Queen Elizabeth’s School in Wimborne, and she was undecided and unsure about her future.

'She had also been caught speeding and it was likely she was going to lose her licence.'

Detective Inspector Williams said Amy had been reported missing after her father Graham returned home from work to find her gone.

He found three notes written by Amy in her bedroom, one of which read: 'To save you spending time looking for me I’m dead.'

A major police search was launched and the following day Amy’s body was found.

Amy’s mother Susan, 51, told the hearing she had no idea her daughter had been so unhappy.

She said: 'I felt it was no more than teenage angst, having just sat her A-levels wondering what to do after and also an up-and-down boyfriend, but nothing unusual.

Amy was a student at the Queen Elizabeth's School in Wimborne, pictured, and had already sat her exams in English, biology and chemistry in the days prior to her disappearance  

'There was no indication that she felt life was not worth living.'

Asked if Amy had been concerned about her A-level grades, Mrs Latham replied: 'She felt she could have worked a bit harder but I don’t think she felt like she had flunked them.'

Ryan McClelland, Amy’s boyfriend, said that when he first started seeing Amy in July 2013 she was a 'happy, care-free and loving individual' but she had sunk into depression around April this year.

He said: 'She told me she was hearing voices in her head. She said no-one cared about her. I could tell she was becoming depressed - it was as if she was having a battle with the voices in her head.

'A month before her death she did say she was going to kill herself and that she would be better off not being here.

'I didn’t actually think she would follow through with it.'

Mr McClelland said when he last saw Amy two days before she died she was 'unhappy and crying'.

He added: 'After she dropped me home I sent her a text message telling her I loved her. She replied “I’m really sorry for wasting your time”.

'I was extremely worried for Amy and what she was going to do.'

Amy's body was discovered in woodland near to family home on this road in Wimborne, Dorset

The Bournemouth inquest heard how Amy had taken to using drugs including cannabis, ecstasy and legal highs in the months leading up to her death.

A post mortem examination found traces of cannabis in her body but gave the cause of death as hanging.

Mr Sheriff Payne, the Dorset coroner, recorded a verdict of suicide.

He said: 'Amy was very successful at school and in sports. She had a wide circle of friends and was well loved.

'But it would appear behind the scenes she had these worries, these concerns.

'Her parents certainly had no inkling about her unhappiness leading up to her death.

'All the evidence brings me to a very sad verdict that she has taken her own life.' 

Following the inquest, Amy’s family issued a statement in which they described her as a 'very bright and kind person'.  

It said: 'Her loss has left a huge hole in our family. She will always be remembered with love and sorely missed.'
