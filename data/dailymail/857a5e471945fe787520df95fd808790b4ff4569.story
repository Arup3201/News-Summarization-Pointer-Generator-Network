A Missouri company has recalled potentially tainted beef products distributed to two restaurants and Whole Foods stores in Connecticut, the USDA has announced.

Jackson-based Fruitland American Meat is recalling over 4,000 pounds of beef because it could contain parts of the nervous system that can carry properties related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.

BSE is fatal to cows and can cause a fatal human brain disease in people who eat tainted beef.

The USDA said there's no indication the slaughtered cattle showed signs of BSE.

Recall: A Missouri-based company has recalled over 4,000 pounds of beef over fears of mad cow disease

The department said the products were produced between September 2013 and April 2014 and were distributed to a restaurant in New York, New York, another in Kansas City, Missouri, and a Whole Foods distribution center in Connecticut.

The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service found the possible problem while reviewing the company's slaughter logs and said the issue may have been a result of the manner that company employees determined the age of various cattle.

The dorsal root ganglia within the nervous system has to be removed from cattle that are 30 months and older but may have been present in some of the products.

There have been no reports of adverse reactions to eating the products, the USDA said.

The meat was sent to a Whole Foods distributor in Connecticut and two restaurants, one in New York City and the other in Kansas City, Missouri

The agency characterized the recall as a 
Class II recall, meaning there's a 'remote probability' of health 
problems associated with using the recalled product.

Early this month, a Texas man died of the fatal brain illness variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which is caused by meat from animals with BSE.

The unnamed victim was the fourth person ever to die of the disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

CJD is a 
rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder in humans, believed to be 
caused by consumption of products from cows with bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy (BSE), or 'mad cow' disease.

Variant
 CJD first emerged in the mid 1990s and is the human form of bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease.

The
 disease, which affects the brain, is thought to have passed from cattle
 to humans through infected food. It causes personality change, loss of 
body function, and eventually death.

World
 Health Organization data, which only go up to 2002, show that from 
October 1996 to November 2002, 129 cases of vCJD had been reported in 
Britain, six in France and one each in Canada, Ireland, Italy and the 
United States.

Experts
 say the disease affects about one person in every million per year 
worldwide, but prions, the infectious proteins which cause vCJD, can 
inhabit a person's body for up to 50 years before presenting symptoms.

During
 this time, a vCJD carrier could pass it on to others, possibly through a
 blood transfusion or through medical instruments, since prions can 
easily attach onto metal surfaces.
