Kate Moss may have already graced the cover of Vogue 34 times but clearly we can't get enough of fashion's most famous face.

Kate, who recently became a contributing fashion editor for the style bible, is back on its cover showcasing one of her brand new designs for Topshop.

Clearly Kate is so iconic that she doesn't need an introduction; her name doesn't even feature on the glossy cover.

Dazzling: Kate Moss is Vogue's May cover star - her 35th  for the glossy fashion bible. She wears a fringed jacket from her upcoming Topshop collection

Shot by Craig McDean, 40-year-old Kate 
poses in a fringed jacket from her upcoming Topshop collection. The 
eye-catching design is modelled on a much-loved one that she lost years ago.

Kate has designed the jacket, amongst other pieces, for her imminent clothing range for Topshop.

Inside the magazine, 
for her second shoot as contributing fashion editor, Kate has styled 
model Freja Beha Erichsen.

Freja wears a
 leather waistcoat, chiffon top and shorts - all of Kate's own designs for 
Topshop - along with a leather corset from Jitrois.

When Vogue announced Kate's new role last October they promised she would bring her decades of experience in the industry to fashion shoots and 'work with her choice of photographers and models'.

At the time, Alexandra Shulman, said: 'I am absolutely delighted that Kate 
is going to work with us in this new role.

'Her 
undoubtedly brilliant sense of style, depth of fashion knowledge and 
understanding of what makes a wonderful image will be exciting to see on
the pages of British Vogue. I am really looking forward to working with
her on ideas.'

Natural career development: The model will bring her years of experience on fashion shoots to her role, said Shulman at the time

Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Models who represent Moss, added: 'We are absolutely thrilled at Kate's appointment.

'This
 is a natural development in her remarkable career. Bringing her unique 
sense of style and  creative sensibility to Vogue is the perfect fit. 
She is the definitive Vogue cover girl.'

She may have just hit the big 4-0 but Kate Moss clearly isn't letting her age get in the way of her career if her recent projects are anything to go by.

The
 editorial role adds another string to Moss's bow after it was also 
announced that she will once again collaborate with Topshop.

The
 Croydon-born model last worked with the High Street brand between 
2007-2010 and will now design a new collection to be sold in 40 
countries in 2014.

The
 blonde was also unveiled as the face of Alexander 
McQueen's SS14 campaign, Rimmel's SS14 campaign, as well as the pre-SS14campaign for Liu J.

Having just returned from
 a sunny extended break in St. Barts - where she helped celebrate 
Topshop boss Sir Philip Green’s 62nd birthday - she seems keen to throw herself straight back into work.

Busy year ahead: Kate Moss, pictured with Sir Philip Green, has also announced she will design a new collection for Topshop, out later this year

Post-holiday glow: The model showed off her 
famous and sunkissed pins in a monochrome handkerchief skirt and 
waistcoat-style top after returning from a holiday in St Barths
