South Korea's largest mobile operator is launching what it says is the world's fastest wireless network this week.

The LTE-Advanced network can download data at speeds twice as fast as 4G networks and 10 times faster than 3G services, according to SK Telecom Co.

With a transfer rate of 150 megabits per seconds, the network can download an 800 megabyte movie in just 43 seconds. This compares with around 80 seconds on the current LTE network.

The service will be initially available in Seoul and its suburbs.

South Korea has witnessed rapid growth of the fourth-generation LTE, or Long Term Evolution, service as the country's mobile phone users are quick to adopt faster wireless technologies

More than 60 per cent of South Korea's 33million smartphone users have subscribed to the LTE service.

GSA, an association of network suppliers, projects that LTE networks will be available in 87 countries by the end of 2013.

The LTE-Advanced technology, however, has room for improvement. While it boasts the fastest download speed, its upload speed is same as LTE networks at 37.5 mbps. 

Currently EE (formerly known as Everything Everywhere) offers an LTE or 4G network with top speeds of 80Mbps in some cities.

The company has a next-generation CAT4 device that will deliver over 100Mbps on its double-speed network.

It will also be running a commercial trial of a network that can offer maximum speeds of up to 300Mbps in London later this year.

South Korean models show off the new Galaxy S4 LTE-A handset, which again displays the super fast network speed. A selection of smartphones designed for use with the LTE-Advanced network are expected to launch by 2014

To accompany the launch of the world's first LTE-Advanced network,  the world's largest smartphone manufacturer, Samsung Electronics, has released the Galaxy S4 LTE-A handset.

The smartphone is the first model produced to run on the country's super fast LTE-A network.

SK Telecom plans to roll out a total of 7 LTE-A compatible handsets in the second half of 2013, with LG Electronics also poised to launch similar smartphones for the network before 2014, according to South Korean news agency, Yonhap.
