Surgeons have used Google Glass in a UK operating theatre for the first time in the UK.

The voice-activated glasses, which feature a tiny display above the wearer’s eyes, can record video and live-stream operations via the internet.

David Isaac, an orthopaedic surgeon at Torbay Hospital in Devon, became the first surgeon in the UK to use Google Glass through an operation.

Google Glass has since been used by surgeons across the hospital, including in a variety of orthopaedic procedures and ear, nose and throat operations. 

Dr George Brighton, core surgical 
trainee and app inventor at the hospital, managed to acquire a set of 
Google Glass last November, before the official launch in the UK.

Torbay Hospital says the technology has ‘huge potential’ for medical education, with students in a lecture theatre able to see and hear from the surgeon’s viewpoint.

Google 
Glass enables users to access functions including maps, voice search, 
video calls and email, calendar and photos hands-free.

‘The
 device itself is effectively a smartphone, head-mounted video camera 
and computer rolled into one, with an eye-level screen,’ Dr Brighton 
said.

‘What’s 
exciting for medical education is that it allows surgeons to record and 
share their direct view of the surgical field. This gives huge potential
 for mentoring and conferencing.

Since Mr Isaac (right) carried out an operation wearing the glasses other surgeons at the hospital have also tried them. The hospital says they could be a fantastic teaching tool as they allow operations to be filmed meaning students can see surgery from the surgeon's perspective

‘If,
 for example, you were performing a rare or complex procedure, you could
 seek the advice of experts anywhere across the globe while operating.

‘The device would also enable consultants to mentor junior surgeons through a procedure, extending their hands-on learning.

‘Or
 procedures could be streamed to lecture theatres full of students, 
giving them virtually the full field of vision the surgeon sees.'

Before 
using Google Glass in theatre, surgeons talk to their patients about the
 project and how footage will be used. They must give their signed 
consent before any filming.

‘Two of 
the key issues we have had to address while using Google Glass in the 
operating theatre are patient confidentiality and privacy,’ Mr Isaac 
said.

‘We
 take these matters very seriously and have been using the past six 
months as a trial period to address the issues while still aiming to get
 the very best from the potential that this technology has to offer 
within surgical education.

The hospital says the main difficulty it has had in using Google Glass in operations is ensuring patient confidentiality and privacy is maintained

‘We
 have been investigating the ability to stream and store video to a 
secure network that can only be accessed by those with the relevant 
consent, and while we can’t currently use Google Glass to connect and 
stream to the internet, we are just about to start live-streaming to 
junior doctors and medical students within the Trust.’

Surgeons
 are currently exploring a number of technical challenges, such as how 
to be explicit about when the camera is filming and when it is switched 
off.

They are also working out how to upload footage of longer procedures without crashing the computer’s memory.

Dr Kerri Jones, consultant anaesthetist and associate medical director for innovation and improvement at the hospital, said: ‘The trialling of Google Glass here is a perfect example of how innovative practitioners such as George are being encouraged to look at leading-edge technologies and assess whether we can use them in a way which would add to the quality of care for people in our area.’
