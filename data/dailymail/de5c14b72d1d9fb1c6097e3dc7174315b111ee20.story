An American woman who was extradited from Australia after disappearing with her daughter 20 years ago has pleaded not guilty abduction in her first  appearance at a US court.

Dorothy Lee Barnett, 54, was found and arrested in Queensland last year after she vanished with her 10-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994 after taking her to a birthday party. 

Ms Barnett was found by Australian and US police in November living on the Sunshine Coast with her daughter Savanna Todd, now aged 20, living under the name Samantha Geldenhuys.

The Australian Federal Government said she be surrendered to US authorities and now faces a count of parental kidnapping and two counts of falsifying US passport applications.

Authorities allege that she did not have custody of her daughter when she fled.  

She entered plea before U.S. Magistrate Bristow Marchant in Charleston, South Carolina, while her attorney requested a bond hearing be delayed.

Russell W. Mace III said he needs time to contact Barnett's family and friends from outside the state and country to come vouch for his client. 

Mace told the judge his client had been back since Friday and he only met her for the first time Saturday.

He told reporters later that he has been in contact with Barnett by telephone since she was arrested and jailed in Australia last November. He would not comment further.

Barnett appeared before the judge in a gray-striped prison jumpsuit and there were shackles on her hands as she signed the court papers acknowledging her plea. 

She did not comment except to tell the judge she understood both the charges and that she would have to remain in jail at least until the bond hearing. 

Conviction on the charges carries a maximum penalty of 30 years. 

She was found in Australia last year where she had been living under several aliases.

Ms Barnett and Savanna's father Benjamin Harris Todd separated in 1993, with the mother being granted two supervised weekend visits a month for their daughter.

It's alleged Ms Barnett abducted their daughter on the fifth visitation.

When she was arrested Ms Barnett initially agreed to be extradited but she later backed down. 

Her lawyers asked the government to prevent the extradition, but Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan ruled this week she had to be surrendered.

'The Minister arrived at his determination following careful consideration of the provisions of Australia’s extradition law and taking into account representations made by, and on behalf of, Ms Barnett,' a government spokesman said.

Savanna (pictured left as a baby and right now) was by her mother's side during a court appearance last year when she was denied bail. She held a sign saying: 'We love you Mum'
