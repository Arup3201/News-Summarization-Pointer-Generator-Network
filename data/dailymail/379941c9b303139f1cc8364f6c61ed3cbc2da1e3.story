A UKIP candidate is spending election day not campaigning but on holiday in Thailand.

David Watson is standing in Basingstoke on a promise to put ‘Britain first’.

But as voters go to the polls he is 6,000 miles, boasting on Facebook about relaxing by a swimming pool.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is confident of making gains in today's elections, but has been dogged by revelations about some of his 1,700 candidates

The UK Independence Party is predicted to make big gains in elections in 34 council areas today and has fielded a full slate of 10 candidates in Basingstoke.

But Mr Watson, who is the party’s vice-chairman in the Hampshire town, is a long way from helping to get out the vote.

The 51-year-old local businessman flew to Asia a week ago. He wrote on Facebook that he could  be there for six months, enjoying the ‘sea views’.

Speaking from Thailand today he told MailOnline: 'I admit I am here. I am here because my wife and I have had issues. It is a family crisis.

'If I get elected I can do the job with my eyes shut. I won't be charging expenses to come back.'

He is the latest UKIP candidate to embarrass the party, after claims of Nazi salutes, photos with Hitler and blaming Jews for the Holocaust.

Mr Watson's wife Phattawan said she did not know where in Thailand he is

In one message posted on April 28, Mr Watson said: ‘First day and ended up drunk on chang (beer) followed by Thai whiskey. Woke with a thumping head.’

The candidate for the Basingstoke South East division added: ‘Today had my tablet repaired and had a nice sauna and massage. Tomorrow must get down to business and join a gym.’

On Tuesday, he posted: ‘Get my condo tomorrow 6 months with sea views all on barter cant wait also has swimming pool below lovely.’

However, there is confusion about why Mr Watson is in Thailand.

His Thai wife Phattawan Watson, 31, said he left the family home suddenly two weeks ago, leaving her to look after their young children.

She added that she does not know where her husband is in Thailand.

She said: ‘He just left. I want to find out where he is. I want him to take responsibility for the children.

‘All I know is he has gone to find his future life in Thailand.’

The couple married in August 2002 and have two sons, aged ten and eight. Mrs Watson also has a 12-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.

Mrs Watson said her husband owns three properties in Basingstoke, two in nearby Brighton Hill, and one in nearby Popley.

He pays the mortgage for their semi-detached home. She claims she has no savings or income, 
and only has 100 pounds that was left by Mr Watson when he went away. 
She added: ‘I don't have anything.’

A UKIP member allegedly posted anti-Muslim jokes and a picture of Barrack Obama mocked up to look like a chimp, it emerged today.

Tony Nixon, from Guisborough in North Yorkshire, has been suspended pending a police investigation.

It is understood Mr Nixon had been canvassing for UKIP in Stokesley, North Yorkshire, ahead of today's local elections.

Simon Cressy, a researcher for the anti-racist pressure group Hope Not Hate, accessed the Facebook page after he befriended Mr Nixon.

He said it included images of US president Barack Obama and his wife mocked up to look like chimpanzees.

There were also racist jokes about destroying mosques, burning Muslims or knocking over a Pakistani with a bus.

A UKIP spokesman said: 'We are shocked to learn about the views of Tony Nixon expressed on Facebook, which are not representative of UKIP.'

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'We are aware of the issue and officers are investigating to establish if any offences have been committed. It would not be appropriate to comment further until these inquiries are completed.'

Mr Nixon was not available for comment.

The Facebook posts disappeared after he was contacted by reporters.

He told a journalist he was in Thailand to visit his wife's parents and ‘to see if there is a way to assist my wife through her crisis’.

He added: ‘I have also rented an apartment here for the family to use during this trying time.

‘My plan is to return to England in the next week or two. While I am here I intend to try and sell some family land.’

Mr Watson received the backing of his agent Phil Heath, who said: ‘He is a good and honest man. Dave Watson and his family have personal problems.

‘He's taken the decision to go before the election because it is urgent, including selling land to help out with the personal situation.

‘I always recommend to my candidates that they put family first.’

He added: ‘He will be away for a couple of weeks. If he's renting a place for six months that may be for convenience in case he needs to go back.

‘If he needs six months to sort it out, I support him on that.’

During the local election campaign Mr Farage was forced to admit his party had not properly vetted everyone standing on a UKIP ticket.

It came after members were exposed for wearing a Jimmy Savile mask, blaming the Holocaust on Jews and branding Margaret Thatcher an 'old w****'.

He defended Somerset candidate Alex Wood over an image which apparently showed him giving a Nazi salute, insisting: ‘I believe him when he says that he was angrily trying to take a camera off his girlfriend who was annoyingly taking pictures of him in the pub imitating a pot plant,' he told Huffington Post.

Hampshire candidate Bradley Monk, 19, wore a mask of DJ paedophile Jimmy Savile to a Halloween party last year and Richard Delingpole, 46, a candidate in Somerset posted a photo mock-up on Facebook of himself stood next to Adolf Hitler. 

Today it emerged Christopher Thorpe, a UKIP candidate in Hertfordshire, was forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform.
