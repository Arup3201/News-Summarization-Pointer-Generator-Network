Police in Palm Harbor, Florida, just northwest of Tampa, had to rescue the doe that made it through a backyard fence and into the outdoor whirlpool spa of a home Thursday morning.

'She wasn't moving at all and I told my wife, "listen, I don't know if the deer's alive,' "homeowner Mike Wyers told the Tampa Bay Times. "But at that time, I noticed the ears on the deer started to twitch."

Wyers called the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office to report that the deer had apparently lost consciousness and had regained it, but was unable to climb out of the spa.

Within 10 minutes, Deputies Tim McTaggart and Kevin Lewis arrived and threw a blanket over the deerâ€™s head to help keep it calm.

Trapper George Lontakos arrived shortly after the deputies. McTaggery and Lontakos then lifted the doe out of the spa.

The stunned deer tried to stand up several times, and fell, but finally got its bearings running off into a wooded area nearby.
