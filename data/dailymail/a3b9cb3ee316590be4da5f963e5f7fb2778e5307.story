Speech: Chancellor George OSborne will propose pouring in investment in the cities on Monday

George Osborne will today unveil his plan for a Northern ‘super city’ – which could rival London as a  global economic powerhouse by linking Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield.

The Chancellor will propose pouring in investment while connecting the cities with high-speed transport links.

Mr Osborne is due to make a joint appearance today with David Cameron in Manchester, where he will say: ‘We need a Northern powerhouse.

‘Not one city but a collection of cities sufficiently close to each other that they can take on the world.’

The Chancellor will argue that although the cities’ combined population of 9million is similar to that of London, poor transport links are holding back their potential.

He will go on to say that the Government is considering new east-west high-speed rail connections.

At the moment, it is quicker to travel the 283 miles from London to Paris by train than it is to travel less than half that distance between Liverpool and Hull.

Train services between Sheffield and Leeds currently take around 40 minutes for a journey of 38 miles. However a journey of a similar distance between London and Reading only takes 27 minutes.

And Manchester and Sheffield are 38 miles apart, but it takes over an hour and 20 minutes to drive between them. In that time you can get from Southampton to Oxford – nearly twice the distance.

Mr Osborne is hoping to build up the Conservative Party’s appeal outside their Southern heartlands and show that the high-speed 2 rail line from London to Manchester and Leeds is just the start of a regeneration process which will extend across the country.

The Government has already agreed to £600million worth of rail improvement schemes around Manchester, including work on the trans-Pennine route from Liverpool to Hull.

Mr Osborne will say: ‘There  is a hard truth we need to address – the cities of the North are individually strong, but  collectively not strong enough. The whole is less than the sum of its parts.

‘So the powerhouse of London dominates more and more. That’s not healthy for our  economy. It’s not good for our country. We need a Northern powerhouse to provide jobs, opportunities and security.’

Mr Osborne will go on to say: ‘We need to think big. We need an ambitious plan to make the cities and towns here in this Northern belt radically more connected from east to west – to create the equivalent of travelling around a single global city. As well as fixing the roads, that means considering a new high-speed rail link.’

Labour’s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘Nobody will believe that the Tories can deliver the jobs, growth and investment which we need for the north of England.’

But Jim O’Neil, chairman of the Cities Commission, said: ‘This is a really important speech by the Chancellor opening up the path to genuine devolution of power and ideas to our northern cities.

‘I welcome his boldness in  calling for faster, more effective communications between key cities that will allow them to operate as large economic hub.’

And former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, who has advised the Government on urban regeneration, said: ‘Let us use economic recovery to spread wealth to every corner of our country. Nowhere is better placed to lead the rebalancing of the UK than the North. The combined might of great cities like Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds and the talent of the people who live there must have the chance to lead this vital part of our country.’

n David Cameron’s enterprise adviser has backed Labour’s claim that there is a ‘cost of living crisis’ in Britain. But Tory peer Lord Young of Graffham,who once served in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet, said people have always struggled with living costs. He told Sky News: ‘The cost of living crisis has always been with us, and you mustn’t underestimate that.’
