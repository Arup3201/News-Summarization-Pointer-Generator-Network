Greek party leaders were today struggling to agree on who will become the country's new prime minister - as they came under increasing pressure from the EU to push through a bailout to save the country's finances and end the chaos threatening the euro.

After early signs that agreement on a new national unity coalition could be reached quickly, the drive by the socialist and conservative parties to create a government that will rule only until February appeared to be losing momentum.            

Monday came and went without any accord on who will lead the coalition, despite former vice president of the European Central Bank, Lucas Papademos, emerging as a frontrunner.

Embattled: Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou is struggling to agree who will be his replacement

Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou and conservative party head Antonis Samaras have been wrangling over who will lead an interim government that aims primarily to secure a new 130 billion euro European rescue package, agreed less than two weeks ago.

The rivals reached a landmark agreement late on Sunday for Papandreou to step down and the temporary government to be formed.

European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamantouros is also being touted a potential leader.

The coalition deal was an effort to calm a political crisis that erupted last week after Papandreou announced plans to put the new debt deal to a referendum.

He withdrew the plan on Thursday following anger from European leaders, an open revolt from within his Socialist party and turmoil in the financial markets.

Opposition leader Antonis Samaras snubbed the idea of a coalition government insisting what Greece needs is 'immediate elections'

Papandreou, half way through his four-year term, has said he will step down after a power-sharing deal is reached.

An agreement on who will lead the new government had been expected yesterday, but telephone negotiations between Papandreou and Samaras had produced no public announcement by this morning.

Some officials said a result might come before a Cabinet meeting Papandreou was to chair at 12noon today.

The wrangling comes amid intense pressure from Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the eurozone’s finance ministers, said yesterday that the leaders of the two main parties must co-sign a letter reaffirming their commitment to Greece’s bailouts and economic reforms before the next batch of bailout cash is handed over to Athens.

EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Greece can receive the next 8 billion euro slice of its first bailout in November, if both parties commit to the bailout program.

Without the funds, Greece will default before Christmas.

After Papandreou’s referendum announcement, the country’s international creditors froze the critical instalment.

Turmoil: Greece's government is in chaos as it tries to create a coalition

Frustrated with the political turmoil in Greece, they have maintained the pressure even after the public vote idea was officially cancelled.

Greece has survived since May 2010 on a (euro) 110 billion ($150 billion) rescue-loan program from its eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund, but all agree it’s not enough.

A second rescue package has been created which involves private bondholders who have agreed to cancel 50 percent of their Greek debt.

Greece has endured 20 months of punishing austerity measures in exchange for the international rescue loans.

The efforts by Papandreou’s government to keep the country solvent have prompted violent protests, crippling strikes and a sharp decline in living standards for most Greeks.

The EU has been accused of carrying 
out a coup d’etat in Greece, after the head of the European Commission 
also threatened the country with ‘paralysis’ unless MPs removed their prime 
minister.#

Jose Manuel Barroso, the EC 
president, had warned that Greece would not get its next payment from 
the EU and International Monetary Fund unless Mr Papandreou was toppled.

EU leaders were horrified that Mr 
Papandreou said a referendum should be held to approve a 100billion euro
bailout deal, which will result in a decade of tax rises and spending 
cuts.

German politician Peter Altmaier 
insisted that Greece’s future in the eurozone would depend on the 
implementation of long-term economic reforms.

‘We have made it clear we want to 
preserve the euro,’ the deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s Christian Democrats said. ‘At the final stage, it depends what
happens inside Greece.’

Meanwhile, Joachim Fels, of Morgan 
Stanley Research, warned that the admission by EU leaders that countries
could leave out of the eurozone threatened even more turmoil.

‘Chancellor Merkel and [French 
president Nicolas] Sarkozy, in response to the idea of a Greek 
referendum on the bailout package, raised the possibility of a country 
leaving the euro – so far a taboo in European political circles,’ he 
said in a note to investors.

‘By raising the possibility that a 
country might leave the euro, core European governments may have set in 
motion a sequence of events which could potentially lead to runs on 
sovereigns and banks in peripheral countries that make everything we 
have seen so far in this crisis look benign.’
