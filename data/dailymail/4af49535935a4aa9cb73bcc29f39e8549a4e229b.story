A third elderly woman with medical issues has come forward to complain of security staff's 'heavy-handed' tactics at an airport after Thanksgiving.

Linda Kallish, 66, of Boynton Beach, Florida, needs an insulin pump and fruit juice to control her diabetes and was left ‘traumatised’ by a search.

Her ordeal comes after reports of two other elderly women who were allegedly forced to take off clothing by staff at New York’s JFK airport.

Upset: Linda Kallish, 66, of Boynton Beach, Florida, needs an insulin pump and fruit juice to control her diabetes and was left 'traumatised' by a search

Ms Kalish claims she had her fruit juice taken away for 10 minutes and had to partially take off clothing to show a security official her pump implant.

‘There has to be a way to address this,’ she told the New York Daily News, saying she will only accept heavy security if she is treated better.

Should senior citizens be exempt from airport body searches?

She also claimed that her insulin was unguarded on the conveyor belt for 30 minutes and she would ‘die without it’ because she needs it to eat.

‘You have to trust them because what they're doing is right, but what happens when it goes wrong?’ she told WPBF.

This all happened on November 29 - which was the same day Lenore Zimmerman, 85, of Long Beach, New York, had trouble at the same airport.

Also angry: Lenore Zimmerman claims she was taken to a private room where her trousers and underwear were removed - but the TSA has denied this

Ms Zimmerman claims she was taken to a private room where her trousers and underwear were removed - but the TSA has denied this.

'There has to be a way to address this. You have to trust them because what they're doing is right, but what happens when it goes wrong?'

The extensive search was prompted because she asked to avoid a metal detector as she did not want her defibrillator to be affected, she claims.

'I walk with a walker - I really look like a terrorist,' she said sarcastically. 'I'm tiny. I weigh 110lbs - 107 without clothes - and I was strip-searched.’

On top of that, as Ms Zimmerman removed her metal walker, it banged her shin and she started bleeding. She had to be treated by a medic.

'My sock was soaked with blood. I was bleeding like a pig,' she said, claiming the officers were unsympathetic and showed no emotion to her.

Grandmother: When screeners saw the bulge of Ruth Sherman's colostomy bag at JFK airport, they decided to take a closer look, much to her dismay

That process took so long that she ended up missing her original flight and had to take a later one. 'I was outraged,' she added.

'I walk with a walker - I really look like a terrorist. I'm tiny. I weigh 110lbs - 107 without clothes - and I was strip-searched'

In the third case, Florida grandmother Ruth Sherman, 88, had arrived at JFK after spending the Thanksgiving holiday with family in New York.

But when screeners saw the bulge of her colostomy bag, they decided to take a closer look, much to Ms Sherman’s dismay.

'This is private for me,’ she said. ‘It’s bad enough that I have it. I had to pull from my sweatpants and I had to pull my underwear, my underwear down.'

Response: The TSA claims pat-downs of elderly passengers must be done as terrorists could get an older person to take a bomb on a plane (file picture)

The TSA (Transport Security Administration) insists that in all three cases its staff followed standard procedure intended to detect terrorism threats.

'This is private for me. It’s bad enough that I have it. I had to pull from my sweatpants and I had to pull my underwear, my underwear down'

Ruth Sherman

‘Terrorists remain focussed on attacking transportation through tactics such as concealing explosives under clothing,’ a spokesman told WSVN-TV.

The organisation claims pat-downs of elderly passengers must be done as terrorists could get an older person to take a bomb on a plane.

‘TSA does not strip-search people,’ TSA Administrator Joe Pistole told Bloomberg. ‘Terrorists are willing to exploit societal norms.’
