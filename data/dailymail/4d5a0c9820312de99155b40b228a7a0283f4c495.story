Tragedy: Mississippi state Rep Jessica Upshaw was found dead of a single bullet wound to the head on Sunday

Authorities in Mississippi are investigating after a state lawmaker was found dead in a suspected suicide at the home of a former colleague, according to local officials.

Republican Rep. Jessica Upshaw, 53, of the 95th District in Diamondhead, was found dead of an apparent gunshot wound to the head in the home of former Rep. Clinton Rotenberry.

The cause of Upshaw's death is believed to be suicide, but authorities are still awaiting the results of an autopsy.

Simpson County Sheriff Kenneth Lewis told  WLOX that Upshaw appeared to have shot herself in the head at the home in Mendenhall, which is located about 30 miles southeast of Jackson, the state capital, and about 110 miles from Upshaw's hometown.

Upshaw, a Republican, was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 2004. She was not married, but has an adult daughter who lives in South Korea and is married with a newborn.

Rotenberry, 60, also a Republican,  served in the 77th district as a state representative from 1992 to 2007, when he lost his seat to a challenger. He has a wife and three daughters.

Rotenberry and Upshaw's daughter, Lauren Upshaw Welch, are Facebook friends. Welch is also connected to Rotenberry's daughter, Rebecca, on the social networking site.

Mississippi state Rep. John Read told the Clarion-Ledger that he was a longtime friend of Upshaw's.

He said Upshaw’s daughter and 
son-in-law, both engineers working in South Korea, had recently brought 
Upshaw’s infant grandson to Mississippi for a visit.

'She was very close with her daughter
 and with her mother — just loved her family,' Read told the newspaper. 
'Her heart was just so big. She’d do anything for you. She was just a 
sweet person. I’m just shaken by this. We have lost a good person.'

No one has been arrested in the case and the investigation has been handed over to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.

The agency's spokesman, Michael Strain, did not return a call from MailOnline for comment.

Upshaw was an attorney who was first elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 2004.

Gov Phil Bryant told the paper: '[My wife] Deborah and I were saddened 
to hear of the passing of Rep Jessica Upshaw. I have known Jessica for 
many years as an unselfish and dedicated public servant.

He added: 'This is a tragic loss for 
her family and all Mississippians, and our thoughts and prayers go out 
to her family during this difficult time.'

Upshaw is the fifth Mississippi lawmaker in to die in the last few months.

Joe Gardner of Batesville, died last month of a heart attack at the age of 68. Democratic Rep. David Gibbs, of West Point, died January 13.

Two Democratic state senators, Bennie Turner, of West Point, and Alice Harden, of Jackson, died in late 2012.

Rotenberry did not answer his phone, and his answering machine was full.

House Minority Leader Bobby Moak describes her as a passionate champion of causes for her district and the state.
