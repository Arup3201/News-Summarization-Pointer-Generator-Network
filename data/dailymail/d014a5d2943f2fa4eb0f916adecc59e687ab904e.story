'Shell of a man': Former Deputy Chief Constable David Ainsworth was haunted by the accusations

A police chief under investigation for allegedly making lewd remarks to female staff was found hanged after saying his force had made him a ‘pariah’, an inquest heard.

Deputy chief constable David Ainsworth was removed from his duties after up to 24 complaints were made against him.

Among the allegations were claims that the £110,000-a-year officer at Wiltshire Police had leered at a woman in an tailored blouse before commenting: ‘Nice buttons.’

Mr Ainsworth denied the accusations and wanted to ‘clear his name’, but he felt ‘abandoned’ by his force and ‘uncomfortable going out’, the inquest heard.

His body was found in the garage of the cottage he shared with girlfriend Joanna Howes in Potterne, near Devizes.

The father-of-four left Kent Constabulary, where he had served for 22 years, and joined the Wiltshire force in 2008 following the breakdown of his marriage to wife Emma.

Known for his sharp intellect, Mr Ainsworth’s ‘ultimate goal’ was to become a chief constable, Trowbridge Coroner’s Court heard yesterday.

The 49-year-old had been shortlisted for the position at Bedfordshire Police.

But Miss Howes said he was upset at being forced to withdraw in September 2010 after he was told about the allegations.

He was removed from front-line duties by Wiltshire’s then chief constable Brian Moore, now head of UK Border Force, and put on secondment winding down the disbanded Forensic Science Service.

He became depressed and sought treatment in January 2011.

Miss Howes sobbed as she told how she found his body on March 22 last year.

‘He felt abandoned by a police service he devoted his life to,’ she added.

‘He felt under scrutiny and made into a pariah. He felt ostracised from his organisation and he felt uncomfortable going out.

‘He wasn’t the same David. He was shocked by the pettiness of some of the [allegations] that were included.

‘David told me senior colleagues had told him it was a witch-hunt.

Mrs Ainsworth, who lives in Coxheath, 
near Maidstone, Kent, with the couple’s three teenage daughters and 
13-year-old son, said her estranged husband had ‘become a shell of his 
former self’ during the investigation, which was carried out by officers
from South Wales Police.

Describing his visits in the weeks 
before his death, she said: ‘The children were visibly shocked. They 
didn’t know what to say to him. He looked physically ill. He looked like
he should be in hospital.’

Wiltshire Police’s director of 
resources, Matthew Bennion-Pedley, said Mr Ainsworth was popular with 
many of his colleagues.

‘He said he wanted to clear his name,’ he added.
‘He was concerned and aghast by the nature of the allegations.’

The three-day hearing continues.
