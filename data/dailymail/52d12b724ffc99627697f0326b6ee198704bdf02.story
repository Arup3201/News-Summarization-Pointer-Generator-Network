A 39-year-old police officer accused of forcing a woman to strip before pleasuring himself and throwing money at her has been indicted more than a year after the case was dismissed by a state court.

Former Philadelphia police officer Joseph Harvey has been charged with depriving the 21-year-old woman, high on heroin and about to have sex with a friend, of her civil rights during a drug raid in 2009.

Federal prosecutors have also charged serving police officer Sean Cahill, 34, with falsely claiming he was with Harvey and that Harvey was never alone with the victim when the alleged sexual assault occurred.

FBI agents arrested Harvey on Wednesday morning - more than a year after a judge threw out state charges of official oppression and indecent exposure and ripped into the District Attorney's Office for taking too long to bring the case to trial.

During the 2011 court case, a woman identified only as 'M.C.' testified she was in the second-floor bedroom of an abandoned home in the Kensington neighborhood, 
high on heroin and about to get intimate with a friend on a mattress on the floor, when Harvey 
charged into the room during a raid with other officers.

She said she got dressed and some of the officers took her friend away, but Harvey remained alone with her.

She claimed he told her to strip and spread her legs before he began pleasuring himself near her. He then allegedly threw $6 at her and told her to use the money to buy cigarettes.

The victim contacted police the day of the incident, and 
again the following day. Police Internal Affairs investigated, and 
Harvey was arrested on April 21, 2010.

Harvey, a seven-year veteran of the police force, was charged with indecent exposure and fired from the Philadelphia Police Department that year.

Investigators linked semen found on the woman's sweatpants to Harvey through DNA testing, according to Philly.com.

Despite the strong physical evidence, Philly.com reported a judge declared a mistrial in the earlier  case after an assistant district attorney improperly referenced the pants, which had not been introduced into evidence. He later reversed his decision.

Then, state prosecutors missed their seven-month window to bring their case against Harvey.

In an opinion dismissing the charges 
last year, Common Pleas Court Judge Barbara A. McDermott accused 
prosecutors of dragging their feet following 'an extensive investigation
resulting in solid physical evidence.'

Action: Philadelphia Police Department Commissioner Charles Ramsey said corrupt officers would be weeded out

'There is simply no excuse for the Commonwealth's failure to resolve this matter before now,' she wrote.

The District Attorney's Office has appealed that decision, most recently to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

In a new development, federal prosecutors also arrested and charged Cahill, a 10-year-veteran of the force.

They
accused him of lying to investigators claiming he was with Harvey at the
time of the alleged incident, and that Harvey was never alone with the 
alleged victim.

Harvey and Cahill have denied the charges through their lawyers.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Cahill will be suspended for 30 days pending dismissal from the department.

'I
think it's always a good day whenever we rid our ranks of people who 
don't live up to value of this department. We're going to continue to be
aggressive to root out corruption of any kind,' he said, according to myfoxphilly.com.

If
convicted, Harvey faces up to one year in prison and a fine of 
$100,000. Cahill faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 
$250,000.
