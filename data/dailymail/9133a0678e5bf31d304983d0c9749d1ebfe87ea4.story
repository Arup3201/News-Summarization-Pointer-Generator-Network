The often-repeated view that Britons put in more hours at work than other countries appears to be a myth, with a new study revealing that British workers spend less hours a week in the grip of their employers than most other developed nations.

The average working week for Britons is a relatively leisurely 36 hours long – or 1,625 hours spent working a year.

These figures put Britain 25th out of 32 developed countries, according to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The average number of hours spent at work per year is 1,776 hours.

Average hours worked in nations studied by the OECD

The hardest grafters, according to the OECD are Turks, Mexicans, Greeks, South Koreans and Chileans.

The countries whose workers clock up the highest average hours in a year are Mexico, with 2,226, Greece with 2,034 and Chile, with 2,029.

Turks, meanwhile, put in the most weekly hours, toiling for an average of 48.9 hours, followed by the Koreans with 44.6.

The Dutch, in contrast, labour for just 30.5 hours a week on average.

However, the situation isn’t black and 
white, with the report revealing that these figures have been distorted 
by an increase in Britain of part-time labour.

When it comes to working very long hours, the Turks lead the way, with the UK eighth in the table

Britain's relatively short average working week is partly the result of an increase in part-time employment

It also highlighted that one in eight Britons spend at least 50 hours at work every week, so Britain isn’t a nation of slackers and ranks well above average in this category.

Turkey has by far the highest proportion of employees working very long hours, with almost half of them regularly working over 50 hours a week, followed by Mexico and Israel with nearly a fifth of employees working long hours.

Conversely, in the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, very long working hours are rare, with only around one to two per cent of employees working over 50 hours per week on a regular basis.

When it comes to overall standards of life, Britain earns a top ranking.

The UK equals New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland and Scandinavian countries for personal security, job satisfaction and earnings, according to the OECD.
