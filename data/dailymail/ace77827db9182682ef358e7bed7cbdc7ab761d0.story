Celebrities and fashionistas are getting all strung up this season with the latest pair of killer heels from renowned footwear designer Jimmy Choo.

As part of the Cruise 13 collection, Jimmy Choo introduces the Taste sandal and it seems footwear fans can't get enough.

Azealia Banks, Elizabeth Banks, Ginnifer Goodwin and Kristin Stewart have all been spotted in the  fashion-forward footwear, which won't be available for non-celebrities until November this year.

Kristen Stewart scored a fashion ace when she donned the shoe at the On The Road premiere in New York

The suede sandal, which comes in the oh-so-summery bold tangerine or classic black, has a 120mm heel and is designed using fishing wire to suspend the 'T' bar on the foot.

Kristen Stewart chose the shoes for her first public appearances following her split from Robert Pattinson, getting the thumbs up from the fashion pack and waiting lists have already started despite the killer heels having a painful £650 price tag.

The new design comes in bold tangerine or classic black and costs £650

The brand traces its roots to a bespoke shoemaker named Jimmy Choo, based in the East End of London in the early 1990s, who catered to the global jet set, including Princess Diana.

The Jimmy Choo company was founded in 1996, when Tamara Mellon, OBE, then an accessories editor at British Vogue, discovered Mr Choo and recognizing a niche in the luxury shoe market, she established the Jimmy Choo brand. Mr Choo’s niece, Sandra Choi, joined the business as Creative Director.

Jimmy Choo attracted outside investment and the company embarked on a significant expansion across product categories, channels and geographies.

Mr Choo departed the company in 2001 and Ms Mellon departed in 2011.

The first Jimmy Choo store was opened in 1996 on Motcomb Street in London, complementing a distribution in some of the most prestigious multi-brand stores in the world. Two years later, the company expanded to the US, opening two stores in New York City and Beverly Hills.

Today, Jimmy Choo encompasses a complete luxury lifestyle brand. Women’s shoes remain the core of the product offer, alongside handbags, small leather goods, scarves, sunglasses, eyewear, belts, fragrance and men’s shoes. The design direction is overseen by Creative Directors Sandra Choi and Simon Holloway, who together share a vision to create one of the world’s most treasured luxury brands.

Part of Labelux GmbH, a privately held luxury goods group, Jimmy Choo has more than 150 stores in 32 countries and is present in the most prestigious department and specialty stores worldwide.
