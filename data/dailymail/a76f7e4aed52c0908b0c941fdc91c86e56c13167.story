Danny Baker may be offered a new weekly show only hours after his furious on-air tirade at the axing of his daily radio slot.

The development emerged after around 250 listeners complained to the BBC about the demise of his afternoon programme broadcast in the capital.

Hundreds more took to social networking sites to voice their unhappiness and criticise executives for calling a day on The  Treehouse on BBC London.

Tirade: Danny Baker told his Twitter followers not to worry about him after he announced his show was being axed - saying he could always sell his Sony Awards, which he promptly posted a picture of (shown above)

Yesterday, however, it was revealed that the 55-year-old DJ is in talks with Radio 2 and TalkSport about possible work.

During
 his live rant on Thursday, he said he was not told directly that he was
 being sacked and claimed managers asked him to keep the matter quiet. 
Baker, who co-presents the show with Amy Lame and Baylen Leonard, known 
as the Candy Crew, then continued on Twitter.

He raged that middle managers were ‘dim bulbs’.

Announcement: Danny Baker announced the news on Twitter - he later claimed he only found out himself after reading it in an old magazine in a doctor's waiting room today

Bad timing: The announcement came two days to the day that Mr Baker announced he had cancer

Keeping it quiet: Danny Baker claims the BBC asked him not to announce the news for two weeks

Supporter Jo Coughlin has launched a petition calling for the show and its star to be spared.

‘This
 is a mere radio show on BBC London but means a lot to a lot of people,’
 she said.

‘Danny Baker and the Candy Crew have a genius ability to make
 a lot of people happy, relaxed and escape to a land where BBC suits 
don’t exist and anything is possible.

Danny Baker announced on November 1, 2010, that he had been diagnosed with throat and mouth 
cancer.

He started chemotherapy straight away before  undergoing radiotherapy in 
January.

The presenter lost 2½ stone and his sense of taste during his treatment.

When
 he was named speech radio personality of the year at the Sony Radio 
Academy Awards the DJ joked: ‘I’ve lost two-and-a-half stone, but I 
won’t be bringing out a DVD on how I did it.’

To
 a standing ovation, he added: ‘I look all right – but I’ve had a 
horrible, horrible time. It’s been really awful. I am not quite here.’

But he was eventually given the all-clear in June last year.

After receiving the news, he tweeted: ‘The call I have been waiting for just happened.

'Turns out I won. I’m all clear. I’m well again.’

The
 presenter then resumed his long-running BBC London afternoon radio show
 and weekly Radio 5 Live programme, both of which he still hosted until 
today. 

‘We need to save this show and 
at least get it transferred to another station immediately.’

Another fan
 Tim MacGregor added: ‘Is the BBC mad? Axing Danny Baker – one of their 
best broadcasters.’

Baker has also had high-profile backing from comedian Rob  Brydon, presenter Miriam O’Reilly and actor Stephen Mangan.

The Treehouse is due to run until the end of the year but it is unclear if Baker will return. 

He
 also presents a Saturday morning show on Radio Five Live and will be 
honoured next week by being inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of 
Fame.

On Twitter, he wrote of his bosses: ‘In the main they are dull 
ex-university types who are “fascinated” by “real” people. Meetings are 
how they view “work”.

‘Being LEAST necessary people to shows, they’ve
 created a culture whereby they are the MOST vital. [There are] far more
 meeting rooms than studios at BBC.’

A Corporation spokesman said: 
‘Discussions have been taking place with Danny Baker’s management 
company for some time about him leaving his afternoon show on BBC 
London.

‘This has included conversations about Danny presenting a weekly programme.

‘Danny
 is a huge talent and we would very much like him to continue to be a 
part of the station.

The decision wasn’t driven by savings. All stations
 from time to time refresh their schedules.’
