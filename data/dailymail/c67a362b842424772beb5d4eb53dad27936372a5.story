Samir Nasri may be out of action for Manchester City - but his thoughts were very much with the team ahead of their top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea as he posted a picture of himself relaxing in his own pool on Instagram.

The French midfielder is out of action with a groin injury and is unlikely to return until the middle of next month, but he looked happy and relaxed as he sat in the pool at his luxury home.

Nasri showed his support for his team-mates and explained he was recovering well as he accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Relaxing at home and trying to be back with the team asap.'

Man City travel to Stamford Bridge on Saturday looking to close the gap on leaders Chelsea, who they trail by five points.

Manuel Pellegrini will also be without Yaya Toure and new signing Wilfried Bony following Ivory Coast's progression to the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations after a 1-0 victory over Cameroon on Wednesday.

However, Diego Costa could also be absent for Chelsea after the Brazilian-born Spain striker was charged by the Football Association for an apparent stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can.
