Maine officials are trying to turn the tables by hunting down some  poachers who've killed four moose since November 3 and simply left their corpses to rot.

The incidents in Aroostook in northernmost Maine occurred during the annual moose hunt, however hunters of the massive animals require permits issued annually in a statewide lottery and all killed moose must be tagged and weighed.

Maine Warden Service officials in late October offered a $2,500 reward for help nabbing a shooter in the west-central part of the state in a separate incident.

Poachers: Maine officials have appealed to the public for help tracking down poachers who've killed four moose in the state's northernmost reaches this month

Waste: Officials don't think the incidents are related. However, all the animals were left to waste away in the snow

In the first incident, where a small bull moose was killed and abandoned, Corporal John MacDonald reported:

'A male and a female are believed to be involved and they were operating a red regular-cab GMC or Chevy pickup with an eight-foot bed.'

Officials don't think the incidents are related.

In the second incident, reported November 4, the moose was also believed to have been shot on November 3.

The third moose, officials believe, was shot the following day. Soon a fourth moose was discovered in the same county.

All were left to waste away in the snow. 

'We are working on all four [cases] diligently and we are hopeful someone heard or saw something suspicious in those areas during the [week of moose hunting],' Sergeant Dan Menard wrote in a release sent to the Bangor Daily News. 

'All moose were shot and left during the third week of the moose hunt.'

On October 28, state game officials announced Operation Game Thief and offered a $2,500 reward for help finding the poacher who shot and killed a cow moose in a more southern part of the state.

That moose was also left to waste, the Bangor Daily News reported.

Other instances: On October 28, state game officials announced Operation Game Thief and offered a $2,500 reward for help finding the poacher who shot and killed a cow moose in a more southern part of the state.

Ticks infestations are blamed, in part, for a decline in the size of Vermont's moose herd, now estimated to be 2,500 — below the optimum number of between 3,000 and 5,000. Similar reductions have been noted in New Hampshire and Maine. 

Ticks can cause moose to loose blood and to scratch off their fur, making it harder to withstand cold weather.

Officials in Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire issued fewer moose hunting permits this fall, citing the impact of winter ticks on their moose populations. In Minnesota, where ticks are among several factors that have cut the population by more than half in less than a decade, there was no moose hunting season at all.
