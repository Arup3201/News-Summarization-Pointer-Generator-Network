Netflix has agreed to stop 'shaming' Verizon on its website when streaming speeds begin to slow, but are adamant that load times depend on the internet provider and not their service.

The announcement comes after Verizon sent the film and TV subscription service a cease-and-desist letter on Thursday, concerning a loading screen message that said its network was 'crowded' when videos failed to load immediately.

Verizon's lawyers said the notice could be detrimental to business and claimed Netflix could not prove that its network was congested. 

But while Netlifx confirmed Monday that the notices will stop appearing from June 16,  spokesman Joris Evers played down that the decision was solely concerned with Verizon's complaint.

Loading screen: The message displayed by Netflix blames Verizon for slow load times

'We do tests of different lengths (of internet speed),' Evers told The Washington Post. 

'That doesn't mean there won't be another one, and it doesn't mean there won't be multiple ones that run in concert after this.'

Netflix said they were trying to help customers understand the performance of the broadband network they were subscribed to.

In its monthly index for May, which ranks the streaming speeds of various carriers and was published by Quartz, Netflix noted that Verizon had taken a strong dip in speed since April.

It was in mid-May that the 'crowded' messages first started appearing.

'We pay some of the world’s largest transit networks to deliver Netflix video right to the front door of an ISP,' a Netflix spokesman told The Verge.

'Where the problem occurs is at that door — the interconnection point — when the broadband provider hasn’t provided enough capacity to accommodate the traffic their customer requested.'

Telling: Netflix has released its monthly index, which ranks the streaming speed of various internet providers. Netflix said Verizon has gotten much slower since April, with Verizon saying they are busy upgrading their network so it will be faster

'This is 
about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband 
provider,' added Netflix spokesman Jonathan Friedland. 

'We
 are trying to provide more transparency, just like we do with the ISP 
Speed Index, and Verizon is trying to shut down that discussion.'

The deadline on Verizon's cease-and-desist letter was set for tomorrow, June 10.

In a recent interview with CNET, Verizon's head of regulatory affairs, David Young, said the blame game was a 'moot point' because the company is busy rolling out improvements to its network that will boost the speeds.

He said any lag was the result ofa recent commercial agreement between Verizon and Netflix, which would give Verizon users better access to the streaming site.

'We can't just snap our fingers and the network is upgraded,' said Young.

'We need new facilities.

'We have to do the equipment engineering.

'Build it and test it.

'We are doing all of that right now.

'And it should be completed during this year.'
