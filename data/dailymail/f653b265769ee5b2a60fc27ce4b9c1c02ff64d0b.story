A callous estate agent left two vulnerable pensioners destitute after conning the elderly pair out of their £260,000 life savings and using the cash to prop up his failing business.

'Greedy' Darren Aston, 42, befriended a 92-year-old widow and her 87-year-old male friend in 2006, running errands for them, accompanying them on hospital visits, and even cooking Sunday lunches for them in their own homes.

But after being awarded sole power of attorney over their assets when the elderly pair's health began to deteriorate two years later, Aston drained their bank accounts in just 10 months.

'Financial hole': Aston's business, Key Moves Estate Agents in Yardley, Birmingham, was struggling financially

Police believe Aston, from Shirley in the West Midlands, used his victims' cash to pay the legal fees for an ongoing land dispute.

Having Power of Attorney gave him access to all of the pensioners' accounts, including shares and savings plans.

The fraudster was exposed when the elderly woman told a social worker that Aston had cashed in £30,000 of her premium bonds as she was no longer receiving payments.

West Midlands Police unearthed £160,000 worth of banker's drafts made out to Aston's business Key Moves when officers launched a probe into his affairs.

He claimed the money had been given to him as a loan, and insisted he had permission to take out the cash in 'bits and bobs'.

But investigators discovered Aston's withdrawals from his victims' accounts actually amounted to more than £100,000. He was subsequently arrested and charged with fraud.

After initially denying the offences, Aston changed his plea to guilty today on what was to be the first day of a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Detective Constable Vicky Henry, of West Midlands Police, said: 'He transferred large sums of money on a regular basis to help clear his debts, he left his elderly victims financially destitute with little or no balance left in their bank accounts.'

The officer said Aston 'slyly weaved his way' into the pair's confidence in order to carry out the scam.

'He played the role of a helping hand there to offer support - but all along he was targeting their money to help dig himself out of a financial hole,' she said.

'He quickly rolled out sob stories about his struggling business and between them his victims handed over £6,000, this clearly whetted Aston's appetite and on being granted Power of Attorney his fraud became much greedier,' DC Henry explained.

'Attorneys have certain duties, including not taking advantage of their position and to act in the best interest of the attorney "donor" at all times - but Aston's actions couldn't have been more at odds with those promises,' she added.

Aston is due to be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on February 21.
