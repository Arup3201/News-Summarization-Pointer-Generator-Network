Exotic tour: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are again heading to a deserted paradise island, only 18 months after their honeymoon in the Seychelles

Most couples can’t hope to manage a second honeymoon until retirement – if at all.

For the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, however, it’s come around rather more quickly.

Only 18 months after their honeymoon on the exclusive North Island resort in the Seychelles, the couple are again heading to a deserted paradise island – this time in the South Pacific.

Kate and William will spend a night 
on privately owned Tavanipupu island, famed for its crystal waters and 
luxury hand-thatched bungalows, as part of their first official tour on 
behalf of the Queen.

Before
 that the couple will travel to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Borneo and the 
Solomon Islands, ending their nine-day trip on the South Pacific realm 
of Tuvalu, the fourth smallest country in the world.

They’ll
 get up close and personal with wild orangutans, have an orchid named 
after each of them and face the challenge of being carried from a plane 
in a garlanded canoe.

It 
will be the biggest test yet of Kate’s much-praised fashion sense, as 
she will need up to 30 different outfits, including one for a trek to 
the jungle.

The Queen is believed to be lending her several pieces of jewellery including, possibly, one of her favourite tiaras.

Her
 famous locks will be also well cared for – Prince Charles is privately 
footing the bill for a freelance hairdresser to travel with them.

And the couple have hired a private jet – paid for by the taxpayer –  for part of their trip.

Sources
 said it would be ‘absolutely impossible’ to travel to remote Tuvalu and
 the Solomon Island otherwise. The Queen is still sovereign of both 
countries.

The tour has been organised to mark the Diamond Jubilee and many of the stops were chosen personally by the Queen.

The
 couple will also visit the Commonwealth nations of Singapore and 
Malaysia on behalf of the British government to strengthen diplomatic 
and trade links.

In 
Singapore, where they land on September 11, William and Kate will be 
afforded the honour of having an orchid named after each of them in the 
Botanic Gardens.

They will 
then head to Malaysia, staying in the capital Kuala Lumpur, where the 
duchess will give her first foreign speech abroad, at a hospice.

The couple will also attend a glitzy dinner hosted by the country’s king in his palace.

Then
 they will fly on to Sabah, the Malaysian part of Borneo, and travel 
deep into the jungle at Danum Valley, where they hope to climb into the 
rainforest canopy and see wildlife including the endangered orangutan.

On September 16 they will make their way to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands.

The
 couple have been told to expect a colourful welcome – complete with 
chanting warriors –  followed by a drive to the capital in an 
open-topped vehicle decked in fresh flowers.

Paradise: The Royal couple will take in Tuvalu, a Polynesian island located midway between Hawaii and Australia which is one of the most remote inhabited places on the globe

The Royal treatment: The couple will be carried from a plane in a garlanded canoe just like the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were during their visit to Tuvalu in 1982

Animal watching: William and Kate will get up close and personal with wild orangutans in Borneo

Getting back to nature: The Duke and Duchess will also head deep into the jungle in the Danum Valley in Borneo

Another
 traditional state dinner also beckons, although this one takes the form
 of an outdoor island feast with meats cooked in underground barbecues.

And
 then, just when the endless rounds of smiles and handshakes may have 
got a little too much, they will be whisked off to paradise – in a 
traditional war canoe.

The five-star Tavanipupu Private Island Resort is known as one of the South Pacific’s ‘best kept secrets’.

It
 says it offers ‘decadent king-sized beds, some of the best food on the 
planet, crystal clear water teeming with life, a relaxing massage over 
the water [and]  “real” local people who wait on you hand and foot  … in
 one of the wildest places left on earth.’

The 37-acre island, discovered by Europeans in the 19th century, was once a coconut plantation owned by Norwegian traders.

In
 the 1970s it was bought by English interior designer Dennis Bellote and
 his late partner Keith Paske, who turned the overgrown island into a 
luxury five star resort.

Poignant: The couple will be given the chance to view an orchid named after William's late, mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, which she never got to see

Stop off: On September 16 they will make their way to the Solomon Islands, which despite consisting of nearly 1,000 islands across 11,000 square miles, have a population of little over half a million

It
 is currently up for sale for just over £7.5million. The royal couple 
are believed to be staying there as guests of the Solomon Islands 
government, which is anxious to promote tourism in the area.

It
 is expected they will stay in a £300-a-night hand-thatched bungalow 
favoured by honeymooners which has been built over the crystalline 
waters of the Coral Sea and boasts a ‘majestic’ king-sized bed carved 
out of bamboo.

Each of the resort’s eight bungalows has a personal attendant who can be summoned with a tap of a tribal drum.

Aides
 confirmed yesterday that the couple hope to do a little snorkelling 
before retiring to bed for an early start to Tuvalu the following 
morning.

The Queen last visited the island  in 1982 when she was carried ashore with Prince Philip from Britannia in a canoe.

This time William and Kate will arrive by plane but the locals are still determined to continue the custom.

‘We have really have no idea what to expect,’ their private secretary admitted yesterday.

The
 couple will be given a tour of the ten mile square island, including 
the coconut tree that was planted by the Queen on her last visit.

But
 it will be rather less luxurious than their previous stop. The island 
is plagued by ants and large rats, and the infrastructure is so limited 
that the couple will stay in only the most basic of hotels.
