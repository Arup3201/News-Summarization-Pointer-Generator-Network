Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone negotiated to share personal number plates, computer passwords and a collection of small properties in a bitter divorce settlement, it has emerged.

But court documents reveal the pair made a deal not to sell their Glasgow mansion for less than £2.1million and it is still on the market, reports claim.

The couple, who created the lingerie brand together in 1996, split in 2011 after Michael, 46, allegedly had an affair with a bra designer.

Deal: Court documents reveal Michelle and Michael Mone spent their settlement dividing secret passwords and number plates but agreed to put their entire mansion - and all its possessions - on the market for £2.1m

Venture: The couple founded MJM International, which owns Ultimo, in 1996 after marrying in 1992

Michelle, 42, raged publicly at her husband for refusing to sell her their baby grand piano and part of their luxurious home.

Unable to reach an agreement, they had to put the lot up for sale.

The couple demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a five-bedroom home, six times the size of the average British house.

It is located in Thorntonhall, a pretty village regarded as one of the most desirable places to live in Scotland.

It is also being offered with all the furniture - estimated to have cost the couple £600,000 - which will be separately negotiated.

Business: After years of bitter divorce deals, Michelle eventually bought Michael out of their business

The property boasts a vestibule and reception room, drawing room, dining room, dining kitchen, family room, cinema and five bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms.

There is a state-of-the-art kitchen designed by the acclaimed Clive Christian and featuring beautifully made Edwardian style units and four dishwashers.

But according to The Scottish Sun on Sunday, they settled on dividing up other items including their fleet of four personalised cars and their own secret passwords used in the business.

Now linked to cricketer Shane Warne and businessman Karl French, Michelle has been embroiled in controversy over student halls being built next to the home where she now lives with her three children.

She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August. The property has a magnificent reception hall and stairway and is now worth more than £1 million.

However, the 42-year-old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of 'anti-social' Strathclyde University students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house.
