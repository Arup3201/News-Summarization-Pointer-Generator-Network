The tricorder, a medical device that scan patients in seconds, originally shot to fame in Star Trek - but now a California firm has made it a reality.

The Scanadu Scout can measure your heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen levels, respiratory rate, blood pressure, ECG and emotional stress - just like Spock's handheld gadget.

It can be placed on the user’s forehead and within ten seconds uses Bluetooth to send the results direct to their smartphone after an array of sensors and a camera scan the patient.

Scanadu Scout is a medical grade tricorder that can measure your heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen levels, respiratory rate, blood pressure, ECG and emotional stress

A a Tricorder Prop from Insurrection, a Star Trek television series. Now researchers have created a 'real' version

It is also able to store previous results meaning that patients can track changes in their vital signs.

'The Scout puts your body’s information where it belongs: in your hands,' the firm says.

'Share it with your doctor and others to take health conversations – and discoveries – to a new level.'

The app comes in Android and iOS versions and will support Bluetooth 4.0.

Users will be able to share their data with friends and their doctor easily.

The tricorder uses a micro-USB adapter that can be hooked into a USB port, and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery.

When it is being used a few times every each, the battery lasts for about a week, the firm says.

The Scanadu Scout is currently in the 
prototype stage of development but the inventors are hoping to file it 
with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that they can launch it 
to consumers.

In an attempt to gather the data needed to pitch the device to the FDA the inventors are calling for volunteers to offer to test it.

Their findings will be used to help modify the design.

The team launched a site on crowdfunding site indiegogo to raise $200,000 for its development - and hit their target in two hours.

'We are in awe at the enthusiasm the community has shown for the Scanadu Scout since the prototype was first revealed six months ago.

'We get calls and emails everyday from parents, researchers, students and body hackers anxious to be part of the first generation of consumers to truly understand their own health,' said Scanadu Founder and CEO Walter de Brouwer.

'We’ve pushed the envelope, had some key breakthroughs, and are ready to share this next iteration of the product with consumers.'

The Scanadu Scout was design by Scanadu Inc., a start-up based at Nasa Research Park in Moffett Field, California.

The device is built on the 32-bit RTOS Micrium platform that Nasa used for Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and the Rover Curiosity.

The team is comprised of data scientists, mathematicians, coders, molecular biologists, mechanical and electrical engineers, and biophysicists.

The inventors said: ‘The device will allow people to see the fingerprint of their health in very minute detail.

‘It allows people to connect with their physician in ways that were never possible before.

‘We will have, essentially, a doctor in the palm of our hands.

‘It is the ultimate consumer device for medicine.’
