Google Trends has a wealth of information about what the world is searching for, and now a study has found it can also reveal when political parties are most concerned about climate change.

By matching Google searches to weather station data, a researcher has discovered Republicans and people from less educated areas search more during periods of extreme temperatures.

While Democrats, and residents of well-educated areas, did so when they experienced changes in average temperatures.

Assistant Professor Lang from the University of Rhode Island used Google Trends to see how often, when, and where U.S. citizens searched for 'global warming,' (pictured) 'climate change' and 'weather.' He found Republicans and people from less educated areas searched more during periods of extreme temperatures

The research was carried out by Assistant Professor Corey Lang at the University of Rhode Island.

Google Trends aggregates all Google searches that are made, and measures how popular a specific search term is.

Users
 can fine tune this to be specific to a particular place, such as a 
country or city, and time, such as monthly or on a specific date.

Assistant Professor Lang
 specifically checked how often, when and where citizens in 205 cities 
in the U.S. used the search terms ‘global warming,’ ‘climate change’ and
 ‘weather.’

The terms 
‘drought’ and ‘flood’ were also included because increases in these 
natural phenomena are important predicted impacts of climate change.

Monthly
 statistics were collected for the period from January 2004 to May 2013.

Assistant Professor Lang then matched them with local weather station data.

He found that
 search activity increased when extreme heat was felt in summer, when no
 rain fell over extended periods, and when there were fewer extreme cold
 snaps in winter.

The terms ‘drought’ and ‘flood’ were also included because increases in these natural disasters have been linked to climate change.

Monthly statistics were collected between January 2004 and May 2013.

Assistant Professor Lang matched these results with local weather station data, as well as the 2008 presidential election results from Dave Leip’s ‘Atlas of Presidential Elections.’

He found search activity increased when extreme heat was felt in summer, when no rain fell over extended periods, and when there were fewer extreme cold snaps in winter.

Such weather fluctuations are consistent with projected climate change.

Interestingly
 though, searches also increased when average winter and spring 
temperatures dropped - events that are inconsistent with global warming.

Assistant Professor Lang believes this could 
mean people who observe unusual extreme weather conditions are 
genuinely interested in learning more about climate change.

Democrats, and residents of well-educated areas, increased their searches when they experienced changes in average temperatures. Search activity increased when extreme heat was felt in summer, when no rain fell over extended periods, and when there were fewer extreme cold snaps in winter

It could, however, also mean that deniers, who experience an unusually cool winter, go online to confirm their skeptical views that the world is not really growing warmer.

‘Weather fluctuations have an impact on climate change related search behavior, however not always in ways that are consistent with the impacts of climate change.

'And the research suggests that different types of people experience weather differently or have different perceptions about what type of weather defines climate change, ‘ concluded Assistant Professor Lang.

Findings are published in the Springer’s journal Climatic Change.
