Miriam Clegg today boasted that she is a much better cook than her husband Nick, as the political battle of the kitchens continued.

The Lib Dem leader’s wife mocked Ed Miliband’s two kitchens, insisting she only had one and it did not have a sofa.

She also agreed her husband is a ‘dish’, spoke about her faith, and revealed how she won the battle to give their three sons Spanish names.

The Spanish lawyer, who uses her maiden name Miriam González Durántez, used a series of interviews today to promote her Inspiring Women campaign to encourage school girls to reach their full potential.

She said: ‘This is not about famous women and celebrities This is about all women. When people say there are not enough women role models its because they do not realise that the role models are not necessarily always in glossy magazines. They surround me in the streets, right?

‘I think this is too important the girls realise they can look for role models wherever they are. They are all there, they just need to look for them.’

She lifted the lid on life at home with husband Nick and their three sons Alberto, Antonio and Miguel.

Appearing on LBC radio, she was quizzed about her recipe for croquetas, which she once cooked for Nigella Lawson.

She insisted that she is a much better cook than Nick. ‘When it comes to cooking there is no contest. I’m better. There are few things I will win, cooking is one of them.’

In the run-up to the general election there has been much focus on the interior – and number – kitchens owned by politicians.

After Mr Miliband posed in a small kitchenette with his wife Justine, it emerged that he had a larger kitchen on a lower floor.

And David Cameron has been seen in both his Downing Street kitchen and at his constituency home in Oxfordshire, where he made his surprise vow not to seek a third term.

The Prime Minister said last week: ‘To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time. It needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework.’

But Mrs Clegg protested: ‘I only one have kitchen and I don’t even have a sofa in my kitchen.’

Miriam Clegg boasted that she is a better cook than husband Nick, but insisted she only has one kitchen at their home in Putney, south west London

The couple met when they were studying in Belgium, and they married in 2000.

She denied that they met dancing, and was honest about what first attracted him to her: ‘When you’re 20 you're impressed by anything else but by the looks.’

When LBC presenter Shelagh Fogarty remarked that the Lib Dem leader is a ‘dish’, Mrs Clegg replied: Well that’s what I think.’

But Fogarty went too far when she said he was ‘good looking in a head boy kind of way’. Mrs Clegg shot back: ‘You are talking about my husband!’

Mrs Clegg is a staunch Catholic, and their sons are being brought up as Catholic despite Mr Clegg being an atheist. The family often attend Mass together in west London.

She said: ‘Listen I have faith and I have always that faith is a gift., it has helped me in my own life to cope with some of the difficulties.

‘This is probably too personal a comment but when I lost my father its what carried me through. I hope that I can pass it on to my children, or at least I will try to bring it there then it’s up to them to make up their mind.

‘We are very tolerant generally of all faiths and in our families we have all sorts of faiths.’

She also revealed how their three sons got Spanish first names. ‘They’ve got Clegg afterwards, it was to compensate,;’ she said.

Antonio was her father’s name ‘so he couldn’t say no’, and she almost died when she was giving birth to Alberto ‘so he had to give it to me’. Miguel is the patron saint of the village where she is from in Spain.
