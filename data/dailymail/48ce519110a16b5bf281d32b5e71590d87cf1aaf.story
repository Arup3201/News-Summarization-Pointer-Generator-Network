A Canadian reporter has been arrested in Washington state for allegedly threatening to kill her boyfriend, a local hockey player, for cheating on her.

Tieja MacLaughlin, 25, from British Columbia, is accused of driving down Kennewick over the weekend with plans to murder 19-year-old Jackson Playfair, a recently traded Tri-City Americans forward.

MacLaughlin was charged Tuesday with felony threats and ordered to have no contact with her boyfriend. She is being held without bail.

The two have been in a relationship since July, but in Playfair's own words to police, it has been 'a rocky one.'

On Friday, the 25-year-old freelance news and sports reporter from Kelowna, BC, reportedly learned that her 19-year-old paramour had gone out with someone else, Tri-City Herald reported.

According to court documents, MacLaughlin called Playfair, who is six years her junior, and told him that she was on her way to Kennewick some 500 miles away from her hometown. 

During the call, the jealous 25-year-old journalist also allegedly told Playfair that 'he would be dead by the end of the night.'

The 19-year-old, the son of former NHL player and coach Jim Playfair, is a forward for the Tri-City Americans. He joined the team two weeks ago after being traded by the Spokane Chiefs, Deadspin reported.

According to her LinkedIn profile, MacLaughlin, a graduate of Wilfred Laurier University in Ontario, covers hockey for Castanet Media and The Daily Courier, and works as a freelance producer for Shaw TV Okanagan.

Following his conversation with his Canadian girlfriend, Playfair reached out to police early Saturday morning to report the alleged threat.

When MacLaughlin arrived in Kennewick later in the day, she was met by officers who informed the woman that she would be arrested unless she agrees to stay away from Playfair.

The 25-year-old blonde hockey enthusiast reportedly promised to leave her boyfriend alone and return to Canada.

Instead, however, MacLaughlin allegedly sent the Tri-City player a text message asking him to meet her in a local hotel.

Once again police got involved, instructing Playfair to tell MacLaughlin that he would be waiting for her in the hotel Saturday afternoon.

At the agreed upon hour, cops arrived at the inn and arrested the Canadian national. When questioned by police, MacLaughlin denied threatening Playfair.
