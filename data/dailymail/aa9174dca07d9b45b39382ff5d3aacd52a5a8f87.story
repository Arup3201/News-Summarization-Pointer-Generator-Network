Water vapour has been detected in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years - or 729 trillion miles - from Earth.

The planet is about the size of the gas giant Neptune, and is the smallest and coldest outside the solar system known to contain H2O molecules - the building blocks of life.

Scientists claim the discovery is a leap forward in the study of distant exoplanets that may in future uncover evidence of alien life.

Researchers used a technique called transmission spectroscopy, which measures dips in light as the planet passes in front of its host star to identify the signs of water vapour.

Previously it has only been possible to measure the atmospheric compositions of larger Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets.

Scientists believe this planet - known as HAT-P-11b - is too close to its host star with a temperature of about 600°C (1,112°F) for even the most primitive microbes to develop.

They suggest it may have a rocky core wrapped in a thick hydrogen gas and atmosphere is cloudless at high altitude.

However, the data picked up by Nasa's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes shows it also contains the signature of water vapour.

Last month, scientists announced that they might have found water clouds beyond the solar system for the first time.

The discovery was made on a brown dwarf, a gas giant planet that failed to become a star, 7.3 light-years from Earth.

If true, the sighting would be an important step to finding habitable planets like our own in the future.

The finding was announced by a team led by Dr Jacqueline Faherty of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC.

The object in question is the coldest brown dwarf ever found, WISE J0855-0714, with a temperature between -48 and -13°C (-55 and 8°F).

To make the discovery, Dr Faherty combined 151 near-infrared images of the world using the Magellan Baade telescope in Chile.

This revealed that the colour of the gas giant matches the predicted models of a brown dwarf with clouds of water ice in its atmosphere.

While water vapour has been spotted in exoplanets before, this is the first time water clouds have been spotted.

It’s thought that as much as half of the planet is obscured by clouds, making it a partly cloudy world like Earth.

Even in our own solar system, the only water clouds known of are on Earth and Mars; for the giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, they are too cold and ammonia ice clouds cover suspected water clouds below. 

Professor Drake Deming, an expert in the study of 'exoplanets' that orbit suns outside our solar system, said water is a precondition for life - although its presence alone is not enough.

'The water molecule is widespread in the universe. Wherever you have hydrogen and oxygen it naturally forms,' he said.

'Even some sun spots are cool enough to contain water vapour - although obviously it's far too hot for life on the sun.'

Astronomers also want to test the idea other planets formed the same way ours did.

In the primordial solar system, particles of dust and ice carried native electrical charges that caused them to stick together.

Early in this process, the giant planets that formed far from the sun had enough gravitational pull to attract large amounts of hydrogen gas.

But water freezes out of the atmospheres of our solar system's giant planets where it occurs only at deep levels that are difficult to observe.

The closer-in smaller planets such as Mars, Venus and Earth had water early in their evolution - although only Earth retains liquid water at the surface.

The smaller the planet the more likely it is that heavier molecules like water vapour will be abundant along with hydrogen.

Professor Deming, of Maryland University, said: 'Our ideas about the formation of planets have been developed to match our solar system and we don't know whether other planetary systems behave the same way.

'We want to test the fundamental question of whether small planets are rich in heavy elements - like the oxygen in water vapour.'

He said the discovery of water vapour and hydrogen on HAT P-11b 'is a key piece of the puzzle' - consistent with astronomers' main ideas on the formation of planets.

Professor Eliza Kempton, a physicist at Grinnell College in Iowa who reviewed the study for the journal, added: 'The first definitive signs of water have been seen in the atmosphere of a Neptune-sized exoplanet - paving the way towards the search for water on smaller Earth-like planets.'
