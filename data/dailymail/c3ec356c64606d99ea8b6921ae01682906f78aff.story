This incredible ‘Extra Terrestrial Vehicle’ is a sci-fi fan’s ultimate toy but the concept car will set a buyer back £75,000, the same pricetag as a Porsche 911.

This futuristic creation by car designer Michael Vetter, or Kit Car Mike as he is known, is based on a run-of-the-mill Chevrolet but is unlike any other car on the road.

Looking more like the car driven by Tom Cruise in Minority Report than anything seen in sci-fi blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, the supercharged engine is a concept car still sure to impress die-hard sci-fi fans.

Sci-fan fantasy: The 'Extra Terrestrial Vehicle' is a sci-fi fan's ultimate toy but will cost £75,000

Concept car: Created by car designer Michael Vetter, or Kit Car Mike as he is known, is based on a run-of-the-mill Chevrolet

With a windscreen five feet high and gullwing windows which open by remote control, the futuristic car makes the famous De Lorean, from the Back To The Future films, look outdated.

Kit Car Mike, who runs The Car Factory in Florida, America, has made seven ETVs and one model is on display at the London Motor Museum in Middlesex.

Set to impress: The car has a windscreen five feet high and gullwing windows which open automatically by remote control

Unlike anything on the road: Kit Car Mike said that he gets 'five times as many people photographing it than if I was in a supercar'

He said: ‘This ETV is built for the person that has had every kind of car and is still looking for something different.

‘I have built more than 100 custom cars and this is the best of the best in terms of looks and reliability.

‘I was unprepared for the initial response I would get while driving it but I would say I get five times as many people photographing it than if I was in a supercar.

Rare: Only seven ETVs have been made and one is one display at the London Motor Museum in Middlesex

Supercharged sci-fi: The car is powered by a two litre supercharged engine which sends 270bhp to the front wheels through a five-speed gearbox

‘If you think a Bugatti Veyron gets a lot of attention, be prepared for something of a different flavour as this brings in so much positive energy.’

The Car Factory website says of ETVs: ' We offer to build any style of futuristic or concept car in a high quality manner where you will be able to drive the car every day if you like.’

It is powered by a two litre supercharged engine which sends 270bhp to the front wheels through a five-speed gearbox.

There are also two cameras inside making it easier to park this awkwardly-shaped car.

Cruise's car: The ETV looks similar to the car Tom Cruise drove in Minority Report, a concept car by Lexus

Old school sci-fi: The ETV makes favourite sci-fi car the De Lorean, from the Back To The Future films, look a little outdated
