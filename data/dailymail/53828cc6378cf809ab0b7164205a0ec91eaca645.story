American businesswoman and model Caprice Bourret broke down in tears this morning as she discussed her happiness at expecting two baby boys this summer, to be born just four weeks apart: one being carried by her, another by a surrogate mother.

The London-based mother-to-be, 41, also revealed that her American surrogate was initially expecting twins, until the girl baby miscarried.

Caprice spoke about her struggle with fertility, about going through several rounds of IVF treatment, and how she suffered a painful miscarriage in her attempt to get pregnant with her millionaire partner Ty Comfort.

Caprice was overcome with emotion and broke down in tears as she discussed her two baby sons, expected this summer, and also the traumatic miscarriage she went through in December 2011

The couple, who met in June 2011, 
finally decided to use a surrogate who fell pregnant with twins last 
December. And then, after appearing in TV diving reality show Splash, 
Caprice discovered that she too was pregnant.

Speaking to Holly Willoughby and 
Philip Schofield on ITV's This Morning, Caprice said: 'It was the best 
day of my life. I remember thinking someone upstairs was really taking 
the mickey. I went to the store and bought 10 pregnancy tests and they 
were all positive

'But 
then the next day I started bleeding and the surrogate, who lives in 
America, called to tell me we'd lost one of the twins. The girl. So I 
went from high to low in a day.'

She continued: 'I
went to the sonographer and was preparing myself for the worst, but 
then as I was sitting on the bed I saw the heartbeat and I was so 
relieved and happy.

'The 
boys are due four weeks apart from each other, in August and September 
and they're going to be the best months of my life. I've waited 41 years
for this! I'm so excited!'

Caprice and Ty said she knew within 
two months of meeting Ty that he was 'the one', and told him immediately
that since she was 39 she would like to have children soon.

'He said he thought that would be the 
case and that was OK, so we started trying and our journey happened very
quickly. I fell pregnant within a month, but then there was disaster in
December at the hospital when we lost the baby.

'We tried IVF three times and then 
after the third go the doctor said he had good news and bad. The good 
was that we had very healthy embryos. The bad was that the lining of my 
uterus was very thin and it would probably be impossible to conceive 
naturally.'

The model said it was a strain on her relationship, and that it was incredibly demoralising as a woman, especially since she was taking hormones to help with IVF: 'I was a bit of an emotional wreck. It was a really tough time.'

Caprice said finding the right person was tricky: 'Everyone is so individual and wants different things. We wanted someone who had a family, who didn't drink alcohol or caffeine, who had never done drugs, who exercised, was kind and religious. And we found her.'

The couple will travel to America in August to be with the surrogate when she gives birth, and will stay there for Caprice to give birth in September.

'Then we come back to Britain and live happily after. This shows that miracles happen. And sometimes they happen twice!'
