He's done some questionable things in his life, but has Toronto Mayor Rob Ford finally crossed the line?

The embattled politician has been accused of stealing another person's seat when he attended the match between the Atlanta Falcons and the Buffalo Bills in Toronto on Sunday.

Shortly after the game began, musician Matt Mays tweeted that the Mayor was in his seat.

Musician versus Mayor: Matt Mays was unsure of what to do when he discovered Rob Ford in his seat at the NFL today

'Rob Ford is sitting in my seat at the Bills game. He stole my seat. I don't know what to do,' he wrote at 4:50pm.

The musician, who fronts indie rock band The Guthries, sought some advice from his Twitter followers, no doubt somewhat trepidatious of the volatile Mayor.

'I'm by myself. I gotta kick him out right? I mean I would kick anyone else out... Am I wrong?' he asked the Twittersphere.

Lisa wrote, '@MattMays After seeing him tackle that old lady at the city council meeting, I'm not so sure.'Steve Fisher advised, 'We all wish we could boot him from office. At least you can boot him from your seat. Do it.'

Seemingly still unsure of what action to take, a frustrated Mays tweeted, 'The mayor stole my f@#%ing seat man!!'

While so far there hasn't been any visible evidence of Mays being at the game, social media has been alive with football fans' pictures of Ford.

According to one Twitter use, a security guard had to be stationed near Ford - or Mays' - seat to shoo away people trying to snap a picture of the infamous Canadian.

The Mayor is pictured enjoying snacks, applauding and posing for pictures with his bemused public.

Fortunately, it seems May finally screwed up the courage to ask Ford for his seat back.

At 3:06pm, the singer-so0ngwriter told fans, 'Got my seat back.'

It's unclear where Ford moved to.
