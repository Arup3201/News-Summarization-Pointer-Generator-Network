The South Korean family of the 2013 X Factor Australia winner has completed the almost impossible task of crossing the restricted North Korean border.

In tense footage, singer Dami Im, 25, is seen returning to the country her grandfather, Suk Young Lee, came from but was never allowed to return home to after war broke out in 1950.

There was high drama at the most heavily armed border in the world as North Korean soldiers spotted the Im family and popstar Dannii Minogue crossing into North Korean land at the Joint Security Area.

Emotional moments: Dannii Minogue learned about the secret that tore Dami Im's family apart during a Channel Seven Sunday Night documentary

The JSA is the only portion of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) where South and North Korean forces stand face-to-face.

In the Channel Seven Sunday Night TV special called 'Dami Im: Finding my family', viewers learned how Ms Im's grandfather, Mr Lee, came to South Korea from North Korea for a brief trip in his twenties.

He was never able to return to his home and family when the war which divided Korea into two countries broke out.

Stranded in the south, he met Bong-Hee-Moon, Dami's grandmother.

The elderly lady looked the most excited of all the family to be at the border, as she clutched on to a photo of her late husband.

She was the first to rush to the other side of the table inside the JSA office, which marked the family entering North Korean territory.

They were warned by Captain Dowsing to stay away from the soldiers either side of the table, who were standing in the 'rock' Taekwondo stance ready to defend.

A US soldier was forced to evacuate them and told them: 'You can't film here'.

'When I went there and saw what was going on and the tension between the soldiers, it was so intense,' Ms Im said.

'I realised it's right next to us and we're still at war and so many people on the north side are still suffering in prison camps and dying from hunger.

'It's so strange that we never really think about that, even though it's right next to where we live.

'Like Grandma said, we really need to be reunified - north and south,' she added.

'It required weeks of negotiation to get permission to come to the Joint Security Area under United Nations command,' Minogue said.

She explained how their phones were jammed and their passports were taken away from them before they were placed in military vehicles with armed guards.

'It made us really aware that this is a very tense area and anything can happen at anytime,' the 42-year-old explained.

Ms Im, who is now an international popstar after winning the X Factor, was just aged nine when she came to Australia from South Korea with her mother and brother to start a new life. Her father stayed behind in South Korea to earn money to support them.

In the documentary she is shown singing and playing the piano as a child in South Korea, as her transformation to a superstar singing Prince's Purple Rain on the 2013 X Factor final is shown.

As she was reunited with family in Seoul she explained: 'I know how they think I'm a big celebrity coming back with a TV crew, it's special they can see what I've been doing in Australia.'
