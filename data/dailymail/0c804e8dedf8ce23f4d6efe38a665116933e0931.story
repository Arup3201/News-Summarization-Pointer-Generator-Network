A grandmother has been charged with hiring her 19-year-old grandson to kill her husband because she was 'sick' of him and stood to inherit his money.

William Strickland, 72, was shot six times while he waited for a ride to his dialysis appointment last month.

His wife, Janet Strickland, 64, is said to have watched as William Strickland, Jr allegedly shot his grandfather in the back with his own gun.

The pair are said to have stolen a bag containing a wallet and embarked on a shopping trip, leaving Mr Strickland dying on the street outside the family home.

Prosecutors say William Jr spent the stolen money on a new phone, gym shoes and tattoos, while neighbours reported that Janet Strickland bought her grandson a bright red Pontiac car as well as furniture for herself.

The pair are charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery and were denied bail.

Janet Strickland was not in court Saturday because she was being treated for lung disease and high blood pressure in hospital.

Assistant State's Attorney Jacqueline Kwilos told reporters the pair 'discussed on numerous occasions killing the victim. [Janet Strickland] stated numerous times to her grandson that she was sick of his grandfather and that she wanted her husband dead. She stated she wished he was not here and she wanted him gone.'

William Jr had lived with his grandparents for a few months after moving from Wisconsin, where he lived with his mother and siblings, the family's 84-year-old neighbor Theolene Shears told the Chicago Tribune.
