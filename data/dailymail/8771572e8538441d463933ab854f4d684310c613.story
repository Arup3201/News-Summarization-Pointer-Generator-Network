E-cigarettes could be luring teens into trying smoking - and lead them onto smoking 'real' cigarettes, researchers have warned.

They found one-third of Hawaiian teens have tried e-cigarettes - half of whom have never used another tobacco product.

They claim if a similar pattern was repeated in the US, it could lead to a 'epidemic of teen tobacco use'.

E-cigarettes were found to be less addictive - but researchers say they could still be harmful to health

There are currently more than 400 brands of 'e-cigs' available. 

E-cigs contain far fewer cancer-causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes, however their long-term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown.

The popularity of e-cigarettes, which typically deliver nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and flavorings through inhaled vapor, has increased in the past five years. 

'The concern is that e-cigarette advertising is recruiting intermediate risk adolescents to nicotine use- kids who would not otherwise have started smoking,' said James Sargent, of Dartmouth Hitchcock's Norris Cotton Cancer Center in a paper published  in the journal Pediatrics.

'These are kids who might go on to smoke cigarettes, which are much better at delivering nicotine than e-cigarettes.

'If this pattern of use is adopted by adolescents in the continental U.S., we could be in for an epidemic of teen tobacco use in this country that could greatly reduce the overall benefits to public health of e-cigarettes.' 

Researchers from Dartmouth and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center collaborated in the 2013 survey-based study of 1,941 adolescents aged 14-15 years old in public and private schools in Hawaii. 

Cigarettes are highly taxed in Hawaii and e-cigarettes, with their potent combination of lower cost and kid-friendly flavours such as mango and pineapple, may be more attractive to teens. 

Thomas Wills, PhD, of the UH Cancer Center, said e-cigarettes, which are widely available in Hawaii, marketing is 'very aggressive here.' 

He added that manufacturers place ads in venues such as movie theaters where adolescents socialize, as well as on radio and television. 

Nearly nine per cent of eighth graders have admitted using an e-cigarette, compared with four per cent who have taken a normal cigarette. 

Professor Lloyd Jonson of the University of Michigan said: 'I worry that the tremendous progress that we've made over the last almost two decades in smoking could be reversed on us by the introduction of e-cigarettes.' 

E-cigarettes have been on sale in the United States since 2006, but this is the first year that the Centers for Disease Control  has measured their use.

'This is a markedly different pattern of use compared to their peers in the continental U.S., where teen e-cigarette use is less than half that rate and e-cigarette users are mainly also cigarette smokers (dual-users),' reported the team.

Sargent and collaborators were so concerned about the findings that they submitted them to the FDA docket to inform proposed regulations on e-cigarettes. 

They note that favouring packaging, and marketing of e-cigarettes is not regulated, and that manufacturers' opportunities to target adolescents are wide open, absent FDA regulation of these products.

A recent study found e-cigarettes are less addictive than cigarettes for former smokers, researchers have proved.

The research sheds new light on how nicotine addiction works.

However, experts warn the long term health risk of e-cigarettes are still unknown.

'We found that e-cigarettes appear to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes in a large sample of long-term users,' said Jonathan Foulds, professor of public health sciences and psychiatry, Penn State College of Medicine.

The popularity of e-cigarettes, which typically deliver nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and flavourings through inhaled vapour, has increased in the past five years.  

The investigators assessed risk status for three groups (non-users, e-cigarette-only users, and dual-users) on variables that predict future use of cigarettes, and found the e-cigarette-only users to have risk that was in between the never-smokers and dual-users.  

Statistical analysis examined risk and protective variables across a spectrum of use, comparing never-smokers with e-cigarette-only users and e-cigarette-only users with dual-users.

Risk factors for smoking cigarettes include protective variables such as parental support and academic involvement, in addition to risk factors including peer smoking and sensation seeking.

On almost all of those measures, e-cigarette users ranked somewhere between the never-smokers and the dual-users.

There are currently more than 400 brands of 'e-cigs' available in the US. 

E-cigs contain far fewer cancer-causing and other toxic substances than cigarettes, however their long-term effects on health and nicotine dependence are unknown.

To study e-cigarette dependence, the researchers developed an online survey, including questions designed to assess previous dependence on cigarettes and almost identical questions to assess current dependence on e-cigs.

More than 3,500 current users of e-cigs who were ex-cigarette smokers completed the Penn State Cigarette Dependence Index and the Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index.

Higher nicotine concentration in e-cig liquid, as well as use of advanced second-generation e-cigs, which deliver nicotine more efficiently than earlier 'cigalikes,' predicted dependence. 

Consumers who had used e-cigs longer also appeared to be more addicted.
