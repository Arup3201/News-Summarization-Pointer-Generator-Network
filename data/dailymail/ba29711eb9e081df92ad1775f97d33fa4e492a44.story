Clutching her husband's dog tags and holding back tears, Chris Kyle's widow said she wished he was with her as she walked the red carpet for 'American Sniper' at the Oscars on Sunday. 

Taya Kyle said her husband would be 'blown away' by the support the film has received and that he would be his 'usual humble self' despite the success of the movie based on his life.

It wasn't only  Kyle's absence that was weighing on Taya. For the last two weeks she has been attending the murder trial for her husband's killer.

ABC's Robin Roberts noted during the interview that Taya had to be on a red eye flight out of Los Angeles that very night.

Taya wrote on her Facebook that she wanted to make sure she was back in time as the trial continues on Monday morning. 

Just hours before her red carpet appearance, Taya shared an emotional post detailing her rough last few days. 

'I have a pounding headache and woke up intermittently sleeping and having nightmares about the evils of the world,' she wrote.

Cooper said the American Sniper crew was glad she was able to attend despite 'all that's happening'. Taya, pictured here with her sister Ashley, has been attending the murder trial for Eddie Ray Routh, who shot her husband dead in 2013

But Taya said she wanted to be there for her husband, who she said would be 'really happy that so much healing is happening' and that military families were 'healing with this movie'.   

Taya added that she believed Bradley Cooper, who played Kyle, 'absolutely got it right' and said she was happy to be able to 'represent Chris' Sunday night, she told ABC's Roberts.

Cooper said the 'American Sniper' crew was glad she was able to attend despite 'all that's happening'. 

Although it received six nominations, the film only took home an award for sound editing. 

Noting that although it was not an 'ideal time', Taya said she wanted to embrace everything her husband and to represent everyday military families like her own. 

Although Taya shared a photo Sunday morning that she described as 'the horrific way I look rolling out of bed,' she was as glamorous as the celebrities in her long green gown that night and thanked her 'fairy godmother' Warner Brothers, who distributed the film. 

'I find myself in a surreal position...like Cinderella who scrubs the floors but has a fairy Godmother who got me on a plane and had a dress and jewelry and even the shoes and spanx waiting for me'. 

Noting that although it was not an 'ideal time', Taya, clutching her husband's dog tags, said she wanted to embrace everything her husband had done and wished he could be with her to share the experience 

Just hours before, Taya shared a post on her husband's public Facebook page detailing her struggle to prepare for what would be an 'emotional evening' 

Less than two weeks ago Taya was wiping away tears on the stand while giving testimony on the first day of Routh's murder trial

Taya walked the red carpet with her sister, who she said will hold her hand and dry her tears for 'what is sure to be an emotional evening'.

Less than two weeks ago Taya was wiping away tears on the stand while giving testimony on the first day of Routh's murder trial.

While clutching her husband's dog tags in her hand, Taya described the couple's last moments with each other.

'We were at the house and we were trying to hurry and get where we were supposed to go,' she said as they prepared to take separate cars.

'We said we love each other and he picked up and hugged his kids like he always did. And when I left he was still in the driveway trying to get more stuff in there.'

Taya said she got a 'bad feeling' when she exchanged words for the last time with Kyle over a phone call not long before he was killed. 

She said he was struck by how quickly he answered, only giving her a terse 'Yup' when she asked if he was okay. 

It was Kyle's police officer friend who broke the news to her that night, she said. 

American Sniper is based on Kyle's memoir of the same name. 

Kyle is recognized as the deadliest sniper in American military history.
