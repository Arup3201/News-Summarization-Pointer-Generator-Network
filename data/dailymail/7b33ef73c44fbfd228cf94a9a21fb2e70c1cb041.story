As the Premier League season gets going, Sportsmail take a look at players new to the top flight with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

DARYL JANMAAT IN A NUTSHELL 

The domino effect of Arsene Wenger taking Mathieu Debuchy to Arsenal saw Newcastle  seek a replacement. That prompted manager Alan Pardew to bring in a right-back by the name of Daryl Janmaat.

The 25-year-old from Feyenoord, arriving for a cool £5million, gave those in Tyneside a taster of what he is capable of with Holland at the World Cup in Brazil. There, he brought his total caps to 21 since making his debut against Turkey in September 2012. 

From U20 to U21 to the senior level under now-Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, Janmaat looks a player the 52,000 at St James' Park can get excited about.

New boy: Holland right-back Daryl Janmaat  moved to Newcastle United from Feyenoord for a cool £5million

All smiles: The 24-year-old is an attacking full-back and is expected to fit straight into Newcastle's defence

Looking up: Janmaat is quick and likely to excite the 52,000 at St James' Park with his overlapping runs

Debuchy would cost you £5.1m in our Fantasy Football game. Janmaat? £4.9m.

SO, JANMAAT OR DEBUCHY? 

Janmaat is designed to replace his French counterpart, but what do the statistics say?

Look away Arsenal fans - and don't shoot the messenger - but Janmaat wins in almost every department from last season, according to Squawka, who kindly did the math. 

Looking at everything from passing to tackling to chances created, Janmaat scores 23.38 points compared to Debuchy's 14.69. He also wins in the defensive market - 9.87 to 8.99.

Janmaat completed an average of 38.20 passes per match with an 82 per cent success rate - Debuchy made just 25.14 passes with 73 per cent finding their destination. Assists? Five to three. Minutes on the pitch? 2,644 to 2,491.

Debuchy does win the occasional battle, though. The former Newcastle defender wins in tackles by the skin of his teeth - 2.45 to 2.20. But, in doing so, he commits more fouls - 1.41 to 0.83.

Make of these what you will, but Janmaat looks the safer bet on paper.

Why pay top dollar for an overly-expensive defender when you can get Janmaat for less than £5m?

1. £7m - V Kompany, Manchester City

2. £6.9m - B Ivanovic, Chelsea

3. £6.8m - J Terry, Chelsea

4. £6.7m - P Metresacker, Arsenal

5. £6.6m - P Zabaleta, Manchester City

53. £4.9m - D Janmaat, Newcastle United

BUT HOW WILL HE GET YOU POINTS? 

Janmaat, a rare breed of a defender, loves to get forward while also fulfilling his duties at the back.

Not only will he get you those appearances and clean-sheet points, the Dutchman will chip in with the occasional goal and assist too.

Last season, Janmaat scored twice (that would be 10 points apiece in Sportsmail's Fantasy Football game) and nabbed five assists (three apiece). Not a bad return for a full-back.

It appears the ex-Feyenoord star has been given licence to do the same at Newcastle by Pardew, so do you fancy a gamble on the attacking full-back that costs just £4.9m?

SO, WHO WOULD COST YOU MORE?

Take your pick. Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne, Stoke's Erik Pieters and Everton's Sylvain Distin all cost more than Janmaat.

In the list of defenders by price, Janmaat falls 51st. Can you afford not to pick him as a substitute?

Going Dutch: Janmaat played five times at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil for Holland under Louis van Gaal

IS HE EXPERIENCED ENOUGH FOR THE PREMIER LEAGUE?

Judging by Brazil 2014, he is. Janmaat had to rise through the ranks to earn that orange shirt, and did so impressively. Van Gaal isn't the easiest man to please after all.

Not to mention, he's confident. Janmaat describes his transfer to Newcastle as the 'perfect move'.

The right-back, having also been linked with Juventus, Arsenal and Manchester United in the past, shows no signs of weaknesses yet. He's there to bridge a gap, and should do so fittingly.
