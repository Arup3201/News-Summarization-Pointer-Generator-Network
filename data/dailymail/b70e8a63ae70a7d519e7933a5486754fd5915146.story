The woman who sparked the investigation into Max Clifford's sexual abuse against teenage girls has broken her silence for the first time since he was jailed for eight years. 

The woman, named only as Jessica, was 17 at the time and an aspiring actress when she met with Clifford in the 1980s.

It was decades before she felt strong enough to speak out.

Speaking for the first time about the encounter, she told Channel 4 News: 'I've always been so scared of him. I had dreams for years and years and years that he was going to come and kill me.

'He said he wanted to talk about a film part he was to put me up for called Absolute Beginners.

'He thought I would be brilliant for that and that he would give my name to directors.

'It was all really exciting. But after all of this he said, I'm going to do all of this for you but what are you going to do for me.

An investigation has learned that Clifford retained a hold over his victims by taking naked photos of them

Several sources had claimed Clifford kept a black bin bag full of these types of photographs

'He then told me to come round to his side of the desk and he pulled me down to give him oral sex. I didn't even really know how to do it. I was so scared.'

The Channel 4 investigation also learned that Clifford retained a hold over his victims by taking naked photographs of them.

Several sources had claimed he kept a black bin bag full of these types of photographs.

Jessica was one of the victims he photographed during their first meeting.

'I was so stupid. I should have just ran away. I was just really scared. He took a photograph of me. And he did. In a very compromising position. And that was the first meeting.'

Max Clifford gave an interview in 2000 saying he had every piece of evidence he needed to back up his scoops

Sobbing through the interview, Jessica added: 'I hate myself. I was an attractive young girl and I hated myself.

'I thought I was ugly because I thought people were able to look at me and know what I had done.

'All the bad things. I don't want revenge but I want him to think about, to contemplate, what he has done to other people.'

The investigation also found that two different celebrities feature in his collection of photographs.

This week Max Clifford's wife filed for divorce after he was jailed.

Clifford, 71, is the first person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree and was sentenced to eight years after a judge ruled he had groomed and degraded his victims.

Now it has emerged that his 51-year-old wife Jo – who was conspicuous by her absence during the trial and was not called as a character witness – has started divorce proceedings against her husband.

Mrs Clifford, who was his PA before the pair married in April, 2010, has instructed celebrity divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth, who is thought to charge £450 an hour and is known as ‘Jaws’ because of his formidable reputation.

Mrs Clifford married the publicist seven years after the death of his first wife, Liz.

Clifford was jailed at Southwark Crown Court on May 2 after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against four girls between 1977 and 1985.

Judge Anthony Leonard said that some of the offences would have  led to charges of rape if they had happened today.

Last week, one of Clifford’s  victims, Sharon Elliott, 48, waived her right to anonymity to exclusively tell The Mail on Sunday that she felt vindicated after hearing the judge’s verdict.

Ms Elliott, who was indecently assaulted in a nightclub toilet by Clifford when she was an 18-year-old dancer, said: ‘The eight year sentence is a positive result for us women and when I heard the judge condemn Clifford for what he said to me, I felt I’d got justice.’

Clifford had sneered at Sharon after the assault, telling her: ‘Don’t bother telling anyone – they won’t believe you.’
