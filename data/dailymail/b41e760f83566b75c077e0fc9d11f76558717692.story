Karl Wilson has been jailed for 16 years for running a heroin and crack cocaine trafficking ring which moved drugs from the Midlands to Scotland

A drugs baron who ran a multi-million pound smuggling ring by hiding heroin and cocaine in Asda coffee tins has been jailed for 16 years.

Karl Wilson, 58, lived in a £400,000 villa in Jamaica after fleeing Britain when his Class A drugs ring was smashed in 2008.

After being extradited back to Britain last year, he admitted money laundering and conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and was jailed yesterday.

Wilson and his gang trafficked heroin and cocaine from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, to Aberdeen in north-east Scotland.

They smuggled the drugs in tins of Asda coffee, soaked in vinegar to put sniffer dogs off their scent.

Wilson, whose nickname was 'Mafia' in the underworld, first went to Aberdeen from Wolverhampton to sell drugs with his associate Melanie Clarke in 2002.

It is believed the pair saw an increase in trade in December that year when other drug dealers went away for Christmas.

They then took £40,000 in cash back to Wolverhampton to buy more drugs and Wilson's gang started shipping one or two kilo loads of heroin to Aberdeen twice a week.

The drugs were then smuggled to Scotland in the spare tyre of hire cars with Wilson often travelling in a car an hour behind the courier.

At the height of the operation, they took just four days to sell a kilo of heroin. Police found £50,000 worth of drugs in some of the tins when they arrested two of the gang members.

In November 2004, officers found Wilson at a house in Wolverhampton with £322 in Scottish notes and the keys to a Mercedes where they found a bag containing £6,990 in cash.

His associate Clarke spent most of 2005 in prison after being jailed for drug dealing but then returned to the West Midlands and linked up with Wilson again.

Police continued to secretly monitor their operations with vehicle tracker devices and mobile phone checks but Wilson fled to Jamaica before he could be arrested in December 2008.

He continued to direct the drug running operation from his luxury £400,000 villa in Bulls Bay, Luceau - one of Jamaica's tourist hotspots - until other key gang members were arrested in February 2009.

Speaking at her trial in 2010, Clarke said: 'Karl was in control and everybody had to abide by him. He said what took place and you had to follow what he said.

'We made a lot of money then (in December 2002) because a lot of the other dealers had gone home over the festive period.'

Clarke, who was released from prison in 2012 after serving half her sentence of four years and two months, died in a house fire 12 months ago aged 34.

Wilson, who holds dual British and Jamaican citizenship, originally came to the UK in his late teens and set up home in the West Midlands.

He worked as a panel beater   before turning to pimping and then becoming a drug dealer.

Eight of his gang members were sentenced to a total of more than 30 years in jail in 2010 and 2011 as part of a long running investigation named Operation Sorcerer.

British police began extradition proceedings in March 2011 and the drugs baron was arrested by Jamaican authorities almost two years later in February 2013.

He was then returned to the UK on June 17 last year to face charges of conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and four counts of money laundering between 2000 and 2009.

Wilson, previously of Tettenhall, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to the charges at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday and was jailed for 16 years yesterday.

The gang initially avoided detection by hiding the drugs in coffee cans soaked in vinegar to hide the smell

Judge Martin Walsh told drug kingpin Karl Wilson: 'An orchestrated chain of supply existed between the West Midlands and Aberdeen.

'The exact volume involved is impossible to calculate but was clearly substantial. You were the organiser and controller.

'You played a leading part in the recruiting of others and were unquestionably involved in the buying and selling in the expectation of substantial gain. By 2004 many thousands of pounds were being made.

'The commercial dealing of drugs destroys the lives of individuals and blights the communities in which they live which is why those who supply the drugs can expect to receive substantial sentences. You were the lead player in this conspiracy.'

Mark Heywood QC, defending, said the drugs baron - who fought a four-year battle against extradition - was 'broken' by his crimes.

He added: 'He knows he has ruined his own life and helped to ruin the lives of many others. His pleas of guilty were entered because he has given up. He is broken.' 

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brennan, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This was an organised group of individuals who had a very slick operation to distribute drugs in Aberdeen but it was not slick enough to avoid detection by police.

'The message from court is a clear one - all drugs offences of this nature will be investigated thoroughly and the punishment can be very severe for offenders.'

Following the sentencing, police are now looking at confiscating Wilson's assets.
