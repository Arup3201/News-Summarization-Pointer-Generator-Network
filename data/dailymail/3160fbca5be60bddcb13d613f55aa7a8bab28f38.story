A former University of Wisconsin football player and his twin brother are charged in federal court with one in a string of November robberies at five businesses.

Jack Ikegwuonu and his brother, William, were charged Tuesday in U.S. District Court with armed robbery and gun possession.

They're also charged in Dane County court with several counts of retail theft for allegedly stealing merchandise from Wal-Mart stores in Madison and Sun Prairie throughout September and October.

The brothers were arrested last week after an armed robbery at a dry cleaning business in Middleton. 

They told police they committed all five armed robberies to help support their heroin use, according to an affidavit filed with the criminal complaint in federal court.

The brothers' arrests took place after police observed an SUV's movements following the armed robbery with a GPS device, Madison police said in a release. The device was earlier placed on the vehicle via a warrant.

'[The SUV] had been initially identified through surveillance images as the probable getaway vehicle in recent armed robberies, including two that took place on State [Street],' the release said.

A gun, along with money 'and other evidence' was recovered from the vehicle, Madison police said.

Jack and William Ikegwuonu are suspected in four other armed robberies in the area between November 13 and 21, and U.S. Attorney John Vaudreuil said they could face more charges when the case is taken to a grand jury.

Madison police said in the release 'The investigation indicates much of the money taken during the commission of these crimes was being used to purchase heroin.'

The retail theft charges in Dane County Circuit Court include a felony and misdemeanors.

A judge entered not guilty pleas to the misdemeanor charges on the brothers' behalf as they stood mute in court Tuesday.

Appearance: Jack Ikegwuonu was active for one regular-season NFL game during the 2009 season with the Phildadelphia Eagles. He is seen here at training camp in August 2009 

Lisa Goldman, the attorney representing the Ikegwuonus, declined to comment to the Associated Press.

Jack Ikegwuonu played for the Badgers as a cornerback from 2005 to 2007. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2008 and was active for one regular-season NFL game during the 2009 season.

William Ikegwuonu played football for Northern Illinois University in DeKalb.
