Manny Pacquiao has quite literally been stepping up his preparations for the $300million fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas om May 2.

The WBO welterweight champion was put through his paces on Friday morning during a rigorous workout at the Drake Stadium in Los Angeles, where Pacquiao is based for his training.

The Filipino boxer took to Instagram to share a video of him climbing the stairs at the athletics stadium as he bids to reach peak physical fitness for the fight in just six weeks time.

Meanwhile Pacquiao has splashed out £8.4m on a luxury new mansion in Beverly Hills, and sealed the deal by offering four tickets to the fight against Mayweather.

Pacquiao acquired the 10,000 square-foot, seven-bedroom property in an exclusive community in California just over a month away from his showdown with the unbeaten American. 

As well as the offer of US$12.5m, it was four tickets to one of the biggest fights in boxing history at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 that struck him the deal.

'No doubt it helped,' Pacquiao's estate agent Elsa Nelson told USA Today Sports. 'The sellers are great fans of boxing and of Manny, so it was a big deal.'
