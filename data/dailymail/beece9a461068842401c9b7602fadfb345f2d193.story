A husband and wife who plunged down the side of snow covered peak were at the centre of a  mountain rescue operation.

The couple, named as Brian and Michelle Carlson, were tethered together when they cartwheeled and bounced down the steep precipice.

They were saved by a mountain rescue team training on the south side of Mount Hood in Oregon, USA, who witnessed the couple crash down the sheer ridge. It was not known what caused the fall.

The stricken husband and wife were lucky to survive, but were left stranded after Mrs Carlson, 43, broke both ankles and her husband, 39, suffered a broken leg.

A third climber, Karthnik Jambunathan, 29, suffered minor injuries after crashing over the snow as he aided the rescue effort.

Flying high: The National Guard scrambled a helicopter to transport the injured climbers to hospital in Portland

'They sort of rolled, somersaulted, cartwheeled, that type thing,' climber Pearce Beissinger, who saw the fall, told KGW.

 'When you're falling at a 50-degree slope angle, it is a pretty rapid fall and as you watch them kind of bounce down the mountain, you know there are going to be some pretty serious injuries.'

Erik Broms from the Portland Mountain Rescue said: 'I was on my way down when somebody yelled falling.

'I literally had to step out of the way before getting hit by the female and the male.' 

Luckily for the husband and wife Portland Mountain Rescue team were training close to the spot where the fall happened and leapt into action.

During the two hour operation the team armed with a stretcher twice descended the peak.

They then used a series of pulleys and ropes to bring the Carlsons up to the waiting  National Guard helicopter, that had been scrambled to the scene.

The couple were airlifted to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center,Portland,  and their family told KGW that they were both recovering from their ordeal.
