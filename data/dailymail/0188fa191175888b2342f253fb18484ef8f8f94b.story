A mother has today told how she hid a live nail bomb in her handbag after finding her three-year-old son playing with it.

Joanne Dixon, 34, found son Levigh Bamber fiddling with a small black package in the front garden of their home in Ribbleton, Preston.

Immediately concerned, the mother-of-eight said she unscrewed the top of the bomb and black powder spilled out.

Levigh Bamber, three, who found a nail-bomb in his garden in Ribbleton, Preston. His mother Joanne Dixon took the bomb, concealed it in her handbag and put it in the garden shed as she waited for bomb disposal experts to arrive

She said it was then that she and her partner Ian Gabbott, 34, realised the device was a nail bomb with a fuse, gunpowder and nails inside.

She placed the bomb in her handbag and rang Preston Police who told her to place it out of the house somewhere cool immediately.

They stood guard for around four hours until bomb squad experts were called from Chester.

They remained at the scene, on Saturday, for six hours and later confirmed the device was 'viable' and had the sun hit it, it could have exploded and killed Levigh instantly.

Ms Dixon said: 'I felt sick. I’ve had three hours sleep in four days.

'Levigh has already had a difficult time, because he has a heart murmur and will need heart surgery before he is five. The thought he could have been killed is terrible.

'It was the hottest day of the year, and we have been told if the sun had have hit it the heat may have been enough on its own to set it off.

'We were told it was strong enough to have killed Levigh, and maim any adult who was in a certain distance.

'The sun always hits our front garden, it doesn’t bear thinking about. I want to move - I can’t stay in this house.'

A 40-year-old man from Ribbleton, Preston, has been charged with maliciously making an explosive substance, namely a nail bomb, with intent to endanger life, and is remanded in custody. He will appear for trial at Preston Crown Court on July 30

She added: 'I took the package off Levigh and I didn’t know what it was at first, until the powder came out. Then we noticed the tiny nails attached to it.

'The police operator sounded shocked - they said: "Put it outside and do it now, now, now". So ran out and put my handbag in the shed'

Ms Dixon, Levigh, and six of her other children - Chantelle, 16, Larissa, 11, Preston, nine, Kayleigh, eight, Angel, five, and Electra, six - were evacuated while the bomb squad made sure the explosive was properly dismantled at the back of the house.

The family’s next door neighbour, a mother-of-one who did not wish to be named, said: 'The police did not tell us what was going on. We were sitting out in our back garden and it was only when I went in for a drink of water that I noticed a bomb disposal van parked outside my house.'

Det Insp Keith Lee, of Preston Police, said: 'The bomb squad were called in and they did confirm it was viable. They arrived shortly after 2pm on Saturday.'

A 40-year-old man from Ribbleton, Preston, has been charged with maliciously making an explosive substance, namely a nail bomb, with intent to endanger life, and is remanded in custody.

The offence is dated between July 11 and 13.
