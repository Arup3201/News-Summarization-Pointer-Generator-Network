Openly-gay carpenter Nate Duivenvoorden will be the only transgender man playing

Melbourne carpenter Nate Duivenvoorden looks every bit your ordinary rugby player - well built with a stocky frame and even the skills to boot.

But the 30-year-old man - who once cut a much slender figure as a female teenager - is anything but.

Before becoming a man Mr Duivenvoorden was finding it difficult to cope as a female and said the transformation was the best but 'hardest decision' of his life.

The openly-gay rugby union player, who will lineup in this weekend's world cup of gay rugby in Sydney, began his transformation half way through his life in the early 2000s.

'The hardest part of the whole process was making the decision to transition,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'As soon as I made that decision it lifted an enormous weight off my shoulders...I rang my mum and I said I need a new name.'

After making the decision to become a transgender he then underwent years of hormone replacement therapy.

Playing for his club side the Melbourne Chargers in the Bingham Cup, Mr Duivenvoorden will be the only transgender representative playing.

Named after gay rugby player Mark Bingham, the competition recognises equal rights in sport and will bring a whole host of international representatives to Sydney to play.

Mr Bingham died in the September 11, 2001 attacks on United Airlines 93 that crashed in Pennsylvania after being hijacked by terrorists.

He was believed to have been one of four men who attempted to take the plane back from the terrorists, preventing the plane crashing into its intended target - the White House.

Mark was the original member of one of the first gay rugby teams in the world, the San Francisco Fog.

Mr Duivenvoorden said that he hopes the tournament, as a legacy to Mr Bingham, will encourage others to play the sport or open-up about their sexuality.

'There's nothing to be ashamed of,' he said.

'You should be confident, you should be proud,' he said, adding that the support of his club has firmed up the belief that you can be both.

The Bingham Cup was name in honour of Mark Bingham who was an openly gay American rugby player that died on a plane hijacked by terrorists

He said his self esteem has received a major boost since taking up the sport as a man and he is helping to combat stereotypes.

Australian Rugby Union CEO Bill Pulver made a commitment in April that the Australian Rugby would resolve to eliminate discrimination in Rugby.

He joined the leaders of other sporting codes to sign a collective commitment to stamp out homophobia in each of their respective sports.

'We’ve worked with a number of stakeholders to develop our Inclusion Policy - mostparticularly, the organisers of the 2014 Bingham Cup, who were instrumental in putting aframework together earlier this year,' Pulver said.

The organisers of Bingham Sydney 2014 have been directly involved in the ARU’s decision to announce the policy and will also be directly involved in development of the policies detail.

The Bingham Cup is on from August 29 to 31.
