The mother of the man former NFL player Aaron Hernandez is charged with killing mouthed the words 'my baby, my baby' as photos of his body in the morgue and bullet-shredded clothes were shown in court on Tuesday.

Odin Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, quietly mouthed the words over and over as jurors saw photos of his body during Hernandez's murder trial in Fall River, Massachusetts.

She also cried as the shirts he was wearing the night he died in 2013 were shown to jurors by a Massachusetts state trooper. The trooper pointed out where the bullets had made holes on the blood-stained material.

Massachusetts State Police Trooper Heather Sullivan told the court that the holes in the Lloyd's shirt were around the size of a quarter, suggesting he had been shot at almost point-blank range. 

Hernandez, 25, is accused of fatally shooting Lloyd, who had been dating his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins' sister, in an industrial park near his North Attleboro, Massachusetts, home in June 2013. He also faces a variety of firearms charges.

Ward left the courtroom in tears twice in the early days of the trial, and the judge warned her not to cry while she gave her testimony.

Since then, Ward usually leaves the courtroom before graphic images are shown.

Tuesday was the first occasion when she has decided to stay while witnesses give graphic testimony about her son's violent death. 

She was accompanied by Odin's girlfriend, Shaneah Jenkins.  

Across aisle sat Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, who returned to court after a number of days away. 

As proceedings began, a woman who cleaned Hernandez's Massachusetts home testified that the former Patriots star's fiancée was visibly nervous the day after Lloyd was killed.

Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, spent time on the telephone, peeking out the window and crying after hauling away a large trash bag in the trunk of a red car, 31-year-old Carla Barbosa, a native of Brazil, told the court.

Miss Jenkins was not in court on Tuesday. 

'She was nervous, she was walking back and forth,' said Barbosa, who added that police were outside when she left the house on June 18, 2013, a day after Odin Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found.

The jury was shown surveillance footage of Shayanna Jenkins, Aaron Hernandez's fiancée, leaving their home with a large trash bag on the day after Odin Lloyd's murder 

The day after Lloyd's body was found on wasteland a mile from the Hernandez home, the football player's fiancée, Shayanna, was seen on their own surveillance cameras taking a large trash bag from the home

Earlier that day, Barbosa testified, she saw Jenkins carry a large trash bag out of the home.

'It was held close to her, she had her arms around it,' she said in Portuguese, which was translated by an interpreter.

Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury charges for lying to a grand jury about not knowing where she disposed of a box Hernandez had asked her to throw out. She was granted immunity recently but it remains unclear if she will testify.

Prosecutors showed video from Hernandez's home surveillance system of Jenkins carrying a large trash bag from the house.

Lloyd's body was found on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's house.

Lloyd, 27, had been shot six times, and police found five empty .45-caliber shell casings nearby. They found another 45-caliber shell in a dumpster at a rental car agency, and witnesses testified it had been removed from a car Hernandez returned. Police have not found the gun used in the slaying.

Prosecutors contend Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home, before driving him to the North Attleborough industrial area where his body was found.

On Monday, two other housekeepers testified that they found several guns around Hernandez's home in the weeks before Lloyd's murder

Marilia Prinholato, 28, said that a black handgun fell onto the floor while she was changing sheets in a basement guestroom at the house where Hernandez lived with his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, and their baby.

'I just took the gun and looked at it and put it back,' Prinholato said, adding that the gun was 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) long and had a full magazine. 

Prinholato said another housekeeper, Grazielli Andrade Silva, showed her a second, smaller gun that Silva found in a pocket of a pair of pants the former tight end left in the master bedroom. It was silver with black accents, she said.

Silva testified that the gun was small enough to fit in the palm of her hand, and that she saw another gun, like 'a normal gun that the police use,' in Hernandez's sock drawer.

Lloyd's body was found by a teenaged jogger on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park about a mile  from Hernandez's home. 

Authorities have not located the gun used in the slaying.

Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team shortly after being arrested in June 2013. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.

He will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.

Earlier on Monday, two people who worked in the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found testified that they heard sounds like fireworks at the time of his death.
