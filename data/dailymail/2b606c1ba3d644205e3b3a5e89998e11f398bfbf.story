A photographer has travelled around California’s independent movie houses to grandiose blockbuster palaces from the early 20th century to celebrate a time before Netflix and on-demand films.

The Cinema series by French photographer Franck Bohbot attempts to bring back the memories of the golden age of Hollywood.

It includes the Paramount Theatre in downtown Oakland, California, which was the largest multi-purpose theatre on the West Coast when it was built in 1931.

Showman
 Sid Grauman subsequently opened another of Hollywood’s most famous 
filmhouses, the Chinese Theatre on the same street in 1927.

It has hundreds of stars's handprints, footprints and autographs immortalised in concrete in its forecourt.

As
 well as the hands, feet and signature of Meryl Streep, Marylin Monroe 
and Frank Sinatra, it also has the cigar of Groucho Marx and the wands 
of Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe,Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint.

All
 these theatres photographed by Mr Bohbot were built during what is today known as Hollywood's 
Golden Age, which stretched from the first 'talkies' in the 1920s, 
through the Great Depression and the World War II, into colour film 
before ending in the 1960s.

The
 Golden Age produced films like The Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane and Gone 
With The Wind and stars like the latter's Vivien Leigh and the 
inimitable icon Marylin Monroe shone bright.
