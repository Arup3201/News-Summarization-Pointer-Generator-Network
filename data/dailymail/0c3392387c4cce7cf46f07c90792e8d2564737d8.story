Sam Allardyce demanded an official timekeeper at Barclays Premier League matches after Harry Kane's controversial equaliser for Tottenham was scored after injury-time had elapsed at White Hart Lane.

With West Ham leading 2-1, fourth official Mike Dean had signalled five minutes added time before Alex Song bundled over Kane inside the penalty area.

Kane's spot kick, initially saved by West Ham keeper Adrian, was saved after 95 minutes and 54 seconds, but the Tottenham forward followed up to score the equaliser.

The late equaliser for Tottenham came when Alex Song needlessly fouled Harry Kane and his reaction to Jon Moss’s decision told you it was accurate. 

Given the time that elapsed, Moss probably allowed a little more time for the penalty to be taken which the laws of the game stipulate and he should be pleased with his performance which contributed to an entertaining game. 

Allardyce claimed referee Jon Moss would not be 'brave enough' to blow the whistle for full-time after Adrian had saved Kane's kick.

The West Ham manager said: 'I'd like a timekeeper to be perfectly honest with you. So we're now doing NFL aren't we? 

'He wouldn't be brave enough to blow at home, would he? He'll say there was still two seconds left, or he will say that when the penalty was taken there were five seconds left.'

Moss blew his whistle for full-time the very moment West Ham kicked off and they were unlucky not to win at White Hart Lane for the third successive game.

'At the end, the referee's not the reason why we drew. More than ourselves and a huge slice of luck for Spurs.

I thought it was more good fortune today for Tottenham.

'The first goal was a complete miss-hit. When it bounces over the goalkeeper after it's hit the floor, it's so unusual that it sneaks into the corner and it lifts the opposition.'

Allardyce also admitted he had some sympathy with Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho over the inconsistency of refereeing decisions after they were denied two penalties against Burnley.

He added: 'Diego Costa goes down after a blatant push from the full-back and it's not a penalty. So that is the inconsistency that we unfortunately have to deal with.

'Here you can see why the referee's give it because Alex's put his hands on him but the thing is that will happen next week and you won't see a penalty, as we saw in the Chelsea game.

'Kane wasn't going to go anywhere because Aaron Cresswell was in a covering position and Harry Kane's first touch was too heavy, and he knew it were too heavy.

'You've got to give him credit for getting Tottenham a point in the end. It was also lucky because he missed the penalty and luckily it went to him to finish off.'

Tottenham chief Mauricio Pochettinho admitted it was a big point for his side as they enter a crucial week in the Europa League and play the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley.

He said: 'We are always confident because we trust our players and we never give up. This is important, we showed big character and big personality.

'In the last 20 minutes it was important for us, it was a big point. It was difficult to play, but it is good to show character. For that we are proud.

'At half-time I tried to change, but after the day wasn't good for us. The second goal, now I have seen on TV, was offside. But it's true that at 2-0 down, for me it's important to say that we showed character and personality that was important for the team.

'I don't know if it was a penalty, maybe the TV can explain better. From my vision, maybe. I don't know. It is difficult to say yes or no.'
