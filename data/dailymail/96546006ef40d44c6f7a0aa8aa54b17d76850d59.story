Money man: Michael Jordan recently increased his ownership stake in the Charlotte Hornets and that helped push his net worth over $1billion

Basketball legend Michael Jordan has become the only current billionaire who shot to fame as a professional athlete.

Forbes estimates that Jordan's equity as owner of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets is $416million and his net worth outside of the team to be $600million.

It reported Jordan now owns 89.5 per cent of the Hornets, which marks an additional stake in the team since he previously owned just 80 per cent.

Jordan's spokeswoman, Estee Portnoy, confirmed that Jordan purchased an additional stake in the Hornets in January 2013, but wouldn't say how much.

Portnoy had no comment on whether or not Jordan is a billionaire.

A
 six-time NBA champion with Chicago Bulls, Jordan earned fame and 
fortune on the basketball court, as well as through endorsements and 
movies.

The
 51-year-old became the majority owner of the Hornets (formerly the 
Bobcats) in 2010 when he bought out Bob Johnson's share of the team for 
$175million.

It
 is that team, and not the various athletic gear or his infrequent film 
projects that have launched him into the realm of the extremely wealthy.

A
 recent evaluation of the team predicted that the Hornets are worth 
$410million, but Forbes states that number may be low-balling it a bit 
considering the Milwaukee Bucks, long considered the least valuable team
 in the NBA, sold for $550million last month.

Forbes' experts pits the Hornets' true value at somewhere between $600million and $625million, and once the money he has spent on the team is subtracted out from his portion of that estimate then coupled with his unrelated earnings of $600million, the total would put him just slightly above the billion-dollar mark.

Technically Jordan is not the first professional athlete to reach billionaire status, but he is believed to be the only person to currently hold that title.

Tiger Woods was named as the first sports star billionaire in 2009 but that came two months before news of his cheating scandal broke, which led to the loss of a number of his sponsors- and the billionaire label with it.
