A ballet dancer who appeared in the Olympics closing ceremony dedicated her performance to the boyfriend who killed himself after they argued about his use of Viagra.

Writer James Andrews, 24, was hit by a train after Eleanor Sharpe discovered he had lied about his use of the drug, an inquest heard.

Before she performed with Darcey Bussell at the Olympic stadium on Sunday, Miss Sharpe, 20, posted on Twitter a photograph of a note written by her late boyfriend which read: 'The whole world will watch you one day. With all my love, James x.'.

Miss Sharpe wrote above the picture: 
'Perfect words for today's performance. I shall dedicate it to you 
@JC_Andrews because somewhere you'll be watching too.'

Mr Andrews committed suicide on 
Valentine's Day this year – the day he had planned to take Miss Sharpe, a
member of the English National Ballet, on a trip to Paris.

After his death, Miss Sharpe said on 
her Twitter account that she was 'completely devastated'. She told a 
friend a few days later: 'I'm about to go on stage now, I hope he's 
watching somewhere xx.'

Before his death Mr Andrews had 
written a message on the social networking site – where he is believed 
to have met Miss Sharpe – saying: 'I wish every single one of you a long
and happy life. I love you.'

Another message posted less than four 
hours before he died read: 'For the past few months I've been really 
down and I'm so sorry for not asking people for help. Please no [sic] 
that I love you all. I'm so sorry.'

At an inquest in Bristol on Tuesday, 
Miss Sharpe said that the two had been in a 'normal physical 
relationship' after meeting in January. Mr Andrews, from Finsbury Park, 
North London, had been staying in Bristol because Miss Sharpe was 
performing at a theatre in the city.

His body was found on the railway line
between Bristol and Bath, but it was not made clear why the taking of 
Viagra had been a contentious issue for the couple.

Relationship: The couple met in January, but split up three days before Mr Andrews killed himself on Valentine's day this year

Dancer: Miss Sharpe was performing in Bristol with the English National Ballet School when the couple broke up

Miss Sharpe, the last known person to 
have seen Mr Andrews alive, said in a statement which was read at the 
hearing: 'I found out that he had lied to me about taking Viagra.

'We met outside the Bristol Hotel [where Mr Andrews was staying] and he said he was sorry.

'He had given me a gift which I found on Monday morning. I asked that we meet up to give it back.

'He would not speak to me and hung up on the phone.'

Mr Andrews, who was said by a friend 
on Twitter to have 'loved his ballerina', was found dead near the former
St Anne's Park railway station the following day – February 14.

Miss Sharpe said she went to his 
hotel, where staff told her that there had been an incident involving 
the police. She said: 'I messaged one of his friends and he told me what
had happened.'

The dancer also told the inquest that 
Mr Andrews's previous girlfriend had cheated on him and he had had to 
leave his last job after a breach in confidentiality.

Suicide: James Andrews killed himself three days after his girlfriend Eleanor Sharpe ended their relationship in February this year

John Wilson, of British Transport 
Police, told the inquest: 'The driver first saw him about 15 yards away 
and, despite his best efforts, the weight and speed of the train meant 
it was too late.

'Found clenched in his right hand was a
note and a plastic medal.' Numerous other notes addressed to family and
friends were later discovered in his hotel room.

Assistant coroner Terrence Moore recorded a verdict of suicide. He said: 'We can be sure that he took his own life.

'Notes which Mr Andrews left at the 
scene and at his hotel room indicate that he had intended his actions 
following a break-up of a short six-week relationship.' Following Mr 
Andrews's death, his friend Scott Bryan posted a tribute which read: 'A 
brilliant writer, photographer and journalist – an up-and-coming talent.

'A man who had so much potential and was destined to do absolutely brilliant things.'
