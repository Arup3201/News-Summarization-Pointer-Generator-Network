The National Transportation Safety Board has said that the lithium battery which caught fire in a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 was not overcharged and experts have said the cause could be because of a 'chain of events' on-board the troubled passenger airliner.

An examination of the flight data recorder indicated that the battery which caught fire mid flight and forced the Boeing aircraft to make an emergency landing didn't exceed its designed voltage of 32 volts.

NTSB investigators are continuing to look at the battery system and plan to meet on Tuesday with officials from Securaplane Technologies Inc., the manufacturer of the charger for the 787s lithium ion batteries, at the company's headquarters in Tucson, Ariz., said Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the board.

Culprit: The Boeing 787's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes, which may have caused this battery fire on a Dreamliner at Logan Airport, Boston on January 7

'Potentially there could be some other charging issue,' Nantel said. 'We're not prepared to say there was no charging issue.'

Even though it appears the voltage limit wasn't exceeded in the case of the Japan Airlines 787 battery that caught fire on January 7th in Boston, it's possible that the battery failures in that plane and in an All Nippon Airways plane that made an emergency landing in Japan last week may be due to a charging problem, according to John Goglia, a former NTSB board member and aviation safety expert.

Too much current flowing too fast into a battery can overwhelm the battery, causing it to short-circuit and overheat even if the battery's voltage remains within its design limit, he said.

'The battery is like a big sponge,' Goglia said. 'You can feed it with an eye dropper or you can feed it with a garden hose. If allowed, it will soak up everything it can from the garden hose until it destroys itself.'

The
plane made the landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also 
detected in the cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines 
have grounded their entire fleets of the problematic aircraft

Both Japan and the United States have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns

There are so many redundancies and safeguards in aviation that when an accident or mishap occurs, it almost always is the result of a chain of events rather than a single failure, he said.

The Japan Airlines plane caught fire Jan. 7 while it was sitting on the tarmac at Boston's Logan Airport.

In a separate incident on Jan. 16, an ANA flight made an emergency landing in western Japan after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin.

An investigator in Japan said Friday that the burned insides of the plane's lithium ion battery show the battery received voltage in excess of its design limits.

Since then, all 50 787s that Boeing has delivered to airlines' fleets have been grounded, and the manufacturer has halted deliveries of new planes until it can address the electrical problems.

The batteries in two incidents 'had a thermal overrun because they short-circuited,' Goglia said. 'The question is whether it was a manufacturing flaw in the battery or whether it was induced by battery charging.'

This preliminary finding, goes contrary to a Japanese investigation on Friday which found that the Japanese Dreamliners operated their lithium batteries at a voltage above its design limit.

Following the report U.S. officials joined Japan's probe into the jets after all 50 of the 787s in use around the world have been stopped from flying.

The new generation of light lithium batteries was going to deliver equal power at half the weight, but it appears that the chemistry inside the ‘thermal runway’ can self-heat if external temperature and pressure change, something which frequently occurs in aviation.

Concerns over the battery, prompted by an emergency landing of an All Nippon Airways plane on Wednesday, has seen the plane grounded across the globe.

The American investigators - one each from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board and two from Boeing Co. - today inspected the ANA jet on the tarmac at Takamatsu airport in western Japan.

An initial inspection by Japanese officials of the 787 found that a flammable battery fluid known as electrolyte had leaked from the plane's main lithium-ion battery beneath the cockpit. It also found burn marks around the battery.

Eight airlines fly the ‘plastic plane’, so-called because its fuselage is ‘spun’ from super-strong but lightweight carbon fibre, which cuts weight and fuel consumption, rather than constructed from aluminium.

British Airways has ordered 24 and holiday firm Thomson Airways has ordered 8 of the planes – with their deliveries starting from next month – but say they are standing by the stricken airliner.

Thomson is scheduled to be the first British flyer of Dreamliners in May.

GS Yuasa Corp., the maker of the lithium-ion batteries used in the 787s, said Thursday it was helping with the investigation but that the cause of the problem was unclear.

It said the problem could be the battery, the power source or the electronics system.

European air safety bosses acted just hours after America’s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued an ‘Emergency Airworthiness Directive’ to halt flights of the planes - the first time a fleet of aircraft has been grounded across the world in 34 years.

The FAA’s emergency  directive said the action was ‘prompted by recent incidents involving  lithium ion battery failures that resulted in the release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage and smoke’ on two aircraft.’

It said: ’The cause of  these failures is currently under investigation’ but warned more ominously:

’These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures , and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment.’

The decision to ground the 50 planes currently in service is a humiliating blow to the world’s biggest aircraft maker, which has seen its shares plummet since the emergency ANA jet emergency landing on Wednesday.

Japan's two largest air carriers All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines voluntarily grounded their 787s following the emergency landing at Takamatsu airport

Some 137 passengers and crew members on an All Nippon Airlines flight were evacuated down escape chutes when smoke was detected on board.

The Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries.

They charge faster and can be better molded to space-saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries.

But the electrolyte fluid also conducts electricity, so as it spreads it can cause short-circuits and ignite fires.

Its corrosiveness also raised concern about whether a leak might weaken a key support structure of the plane.

Paul Czysz, professor emeritus of aeronautical engineering at St. Louis University said:

‘Unfortunately, what Boeing did to save weight is use the same batteries that are in the electric cars, and they are running into the same problems with the 787 as the problems that have shown up in electric cars.’

The battery fire is just one of  a series of problems  - including  two fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late.

Among the 50 planes grounded are the six Dreamliners owned by United Airlines, the only U.S. airline to operate the plane. The Indian government also ordered Air India to ground its fleet of six 787s.

The two Dreamliners owned by Poland’s LOT Airlines were also grounded alongside the 24 in Japan.

On Wednesday a Qatar airlines 787 flight from London’s Heathrow airport was also cancelled ahead of the global grounding.

All will be subject to strict safety tests before being allowed to take off again.

Jim McNerney, Boeing's chairman, president and CEO, said the company is working with the FAA to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.

'We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity,' he said in a statement.

'We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service.'

Mike Sinnett, chief engineer on the 787, said last week that the plane's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault.

He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.
