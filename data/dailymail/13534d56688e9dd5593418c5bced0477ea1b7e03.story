Malcolm Fraser adored the Whitney Houston film The Bodyguard, pigged out eating ice cream straight from the tub and would boast to his grandkids about his huge Twitter following.  

That's according to the former prime minister's granddaughter, Rachael Fraser, who delivered a loving tribute to her grandfather at a funeral service in Melbourne on Friday.

Ms Fraser told mourners, including prime ministers past and present, that her much-loved granddad was a 'great leader' for the country but also a 'joker at heart' who put his kids and grandkids first. 

'A few years ago, grandad was intrigued as to why all his grandchildren were taking photos and constantly checking their phones,' a composed Ms Fraser said.

'After a few long conversations about both Twitter and Facebook at, the age of 81 grandad seemed to have his accounts up and running in no time and became more active than all of us put together. 

'I still remember the cheeky grin on his face when he said "I've got 20,000 followers, how many do you have, Rach?" 

'This is only a few months after having his Twitter account.' 

Ms Fraser told mourners that he treasured his family deeply and had a way of embracing anything his children and grandchildren were passionate about, whether that be farming, horses, surfing or teaching.

'Grandad treasured moments when the family were together. He would often take photos and create collages that he would send around to each of us to keep hold of. 

'He also loved Christmas time, and at every Christmas dinner I always wanted to open the presents early and to convince the rest of the family grandad was by best bet.  

'Once I had him on side it was harder for granny to say no. Grandad was always happy to talk no matter what time of day it was. 

'At one point a few weeks ago, I called grandad at 10pm as I had to make a difficult decision. 

'He was reading next to granny at the time, however, that didn't stop either of them from listening and picking up the phone.'

'Grandad gave me just enough advice so that the decision still had to be made myself, but I felt more content in doing so. 

'Grandad's favourite film was 'The Bodyguard' because of Whitney Houston and every time I stayed with him he would ask granny and I if we wanted to watch it, as if we had never seen it before.'

Liberal MP Ewen Jones was among those who praised Ms Fraser's speech. '(It) was just brilliant,' he tweeted. 'Makes you proud to hear it, let alone know the family'. 

Two of Mr Fraser's children, Hugh and Phoebe, and his parliamentary colleague Peter Nixon also addressed the service. 

''He loved Australia,' Hugh said. 'He was not merely one of its sons, but one of it's most fervent custodians. i feel the world is slightly less safe now.'

Mr Nixon recalled Mr Fraser's considerable achievements as prime minister from 1975 to 1983, including opening the country to Vietnamese migrants and introducing Freedom of Information laws.  

He died after a brief illness last week, age 84. 

'The country has lost a unique and great Australian,' Mr Nixon said.
