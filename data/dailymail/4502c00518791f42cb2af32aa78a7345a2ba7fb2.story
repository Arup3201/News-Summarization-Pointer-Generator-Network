A tiny Chihuahua with no front legs has become an internet sensation for learning to get around by hopping like a kangaroo.

Plucky Pee-Wee was almost put down after he was born without any front limbs - but now he has become a web star after his owner began putting pictures and videos of him online.

Pee Wee, who weighs about the same as a bag of sugar, gets around by hopping on his back legs and using his tail as a counterbalance - just like the Australian marsupials.

Triumph over adversity: Plucky Chihuahua Pee-Wee isn't held back by having no front legs, chosing to hop around like a kangaroo instead

Saved: The cute pup from Wisconsin was almost put down after being born without any front legs

Web fame: The cheeky Chihuahua has become an internet star since owner Patrice Brennan uploaded videos

Owner Patrice Brennan said: "Pee-Wee was surrendered by his breeder because they couldn't sell him because of his unique disability.

"It's cruel really - but he was given to an organisation called The Mia Foundation. As soon as I saw him it was love at first sight.

"He's just the most cute, kindest, most loving dog ever. He runs and hops about like a kangaroo and can get up to quite a big speed.

Safe and sound: Pee-Wee gets some much-needed rest from hopping around the house in Wisconsin

"Pee-Wee is definitely a little rocket whenever there is food about. He's brilliant, really - he's never had front legs so he doesn't let not having them slow him down at all."

Patrice got Pee-Wee for her 50th birthday in December - when the little pup was so small he could fit in the palm of her hand.

When the little pup - who is only five months old - stops growing, she is planning on getting him a specialised wheelchair to take the strain off his tiny back legs.

Animal shelter volunteer Patrice reckons Pee-Wee can keep up with her other four Chihuahuas.

She said: "He is quite the little spitfire. He will be getting a cart in the next couple of months so that I can take him for walks.

"I love this little boy so much, and he is one of the greatest blessings of my life. Pee-Wee does not let his disability hinder him in any way whatsoever.

Motto: With Pee-Wee's hopping exploits, Patrice says: 'We never let adversity get in the way of your own happiness'

Snug: Huddled deep in a basket of soft toys, Pee-Wee is at home with his new life in Wisconsin

"Basically, he's an inspiration, because he can do anything that dogs with four legs can do.

"Our motto is 'Never let adversity get in the way of your own happiness'." 

Since she began posting pictures of Pee-Wee on Facebook two weeks ago, the little pup who lives with her in Wisconsin in the U.S., has gathered thousands of fans.
