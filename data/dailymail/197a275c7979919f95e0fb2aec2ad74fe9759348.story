She played the ice-cold spy chief M in the James Bond films for the past 17 years.

But now Dame Judi Dench has had a chance to compare her on-screen persona with a real-life head of a secretive intelligence agency.

The actress came face-to-face with former head of MI5 Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller.

Double take: Real-life spy chief Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller meets Dame Judi Dench, right, who played M in the Bond films for 17 years

Dame Eliza used the opportunity of guest-editing Radio 4's Today programme 
to interview her fictional counterpart and criticise the Guardian newspaper for publishing highly sensitive material from U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The 65-year-old former spook also revealed she was nearly 
thrown out of a pub after being mistaken for a prostitute while training
 to be a spy.

Dame Eliza had been tasked to find out key personal details from a stranger in a pub during an exercise.

But
 her attempts to elicit the information did not elude the eye of the 
barman who thought she was more lady of the night than spook.

'I said, but Brian has driven me for years. "No, no he won't know the way". I said: "To the Lego building on the South Bank? He can't miss it"

She
 said: 'The task was to pick someone up in a pub and learn enough about 
them that you had their date of birth and what they did and what their 
full name was.

'I 
was sent off to a particular pub and it was quite clear that the barman 
thought I was a hooker and he tried to throw me out and I was getting 
desperate because I knew I was going to fail this particular test.

Former spy chief Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller attacked the Guardian newspaper for publishing leaked information from U.S. intelligence whistleblower 
Edward Snowden, pictured above.

She said the paper had done untold damage to counter-terrorism efforts with its revelations.

The ex-Director General of MI5 added that only those in the intelligence services could truly understand the danger of publishing details about the activities of U.S. and UK spy agencies.

Dame Eliza said: 'I do understand there are people who think he has done the public a service and who applaud him.

'But
 I can't be one of them because what neither the Guardian, nor really 
anybody, including me, can judge is what damage he has done to 
counter-terrorism.

'We 
can't, I can't, they can't see what the loss of information is; what 
plots were being investigated that have now gone dark; what will now not
 be detected and not now be thwarted.

She added: 'My concern is the damage which I don't think anybody outside the intelligence community can really detect or judge.

'I don't think those who have published can possibly work out what those consequences are because they don't have access to the information.'

She told the programme: 'The debate should not be what the capability of the state is, because the terrorist has that capability. But what should be authorised and who does the authorisation and what are the limits on it.'

Dame
 Eliza also speculated that U.S. authorities might seek to do a deal 
with Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia after 
leaking thousands of sensitive government documents earlier this year, 
to prevent more information being disclosed.

She
 said: 'I think what will happen actually is there will come a deal that
 he doesn't release any more, but I really don't know.'

Eventually, another drinker turned his attentions on her and she managed to extract enough information.

'So
 I sat down in the corner feeling rather miserable and had a drink, and I
 was picked up by an American who was selling lasers, I think, to the 
Russians. I thought he was a plant — I couldn’t believe he was real.'

She
 added: 'He was lonely, he told me his entire life history. I kept 
having to rush out to the ladies and write it down.

'I got sort of an 
essay on him and I got a distinction in that part of the test and I had 
done nothing but sit there.'

The former spy chief, who resigned as
 Director General of MI5 in 2007, took the opportunity of a day in the 
editor's chair at Radio 4's flagship current affairs programme to 
interview Dame Judi Dench.

The
 actress told how she was once late for lunch with the boss of MI6 – 
because the driver sent by the Intelligence Service could not find where
 to pick her up.

Dame 
Judi, who famously played spy boss M in the James Bond movies for a 
17-year span, had been invited along to the London HQ to meet her 
real-life counterpart Sir David Spedding.

But
 in an interview for the BBC Radio 4 Today programme she explained that 
she was issued with a special driver whose bungling led to her being 45 
minutes late.

Dame Judi tells her: ‘I did get to go to MI6 once – I was invited to lunch by Sir David Spedding.

'I
 said but Brian has driven me for years. "No, no he won’t know the way".
 I said, "To the Lego building on the South Bank? He can’t miss it".

'But
 they did send their driver - he couldn’t find me. So subsequently I was
 three-quarters of an hour late. I was so late for lunch - 
embarrassingly late.'

Other guest presenters for the Today 
programme include Michael Palin on Monday, Barclays boss Antony Jenkins 
on Tuesday and musician PJ Harvey on Thursday and Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

Sir Tim today revealed how the BBC prevented him from commissioning an atheist to give the Thought for the Day item.

The man credited with inventing the internet guest-edited the Boxing Day broadcast of Radio 4's Today programme.

But
 when he explained to programme bosses about his plans for the Thought 
for the Day slot, he was told only a religious leader would do.

Asked
 about how he coped with editing the programmed, he said: 'Thought for 
the Day was an interesting point. There I was saying if we have a 
thought, why can’t it be a thought from an atheist?

'I’m
 very sensitive about it - the background and a certain amount of 
discrimination about it around the world against atheists - and wondered
 whether it was my duty to poke a bit at the BBC and its tradition.'

But
 an atheist was invited to 
deliver an 'alternative thought for the day' because the usual slot was 
part of the BBC's religious programming and therefore could not be given
 by an atheist.
