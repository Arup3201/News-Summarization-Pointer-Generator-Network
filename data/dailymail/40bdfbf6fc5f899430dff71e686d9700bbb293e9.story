IT used to be unfortunate centre-backs who felt the brunt of Chris Sutton’s directness in a challenge. Now it is the financial powerbrokers at Celtic.

To Sutton, doing everything to retain both Kris Commons and John Guidetti is essential for the Parkhead club if they are to begin enticing supporters back through the turnstiles. Enough is enough, he insists, when it comes to star quality drifting away from the east end of Glasgow.

A key figure in the Martin O’Neill era, Sutton accepts the monetary environment is far more demanding for Celtic in the present day. Yet he would also contend that it doesn’t provide a permanent excuse.

‘I do think there comes a time when you look at the crowds, and the stadium is half full, where Celtic are going to have to show some intent at some stage,’ argued Sutton, who will be back at Parkhead as part of the BT Sports presenting team for Thursday's tie with Red Bull Salzburg.

‘They need to draw a line in the sand because fans go to football matches to watch players.

‘Top players get bums on seats. If Commons goes and if Guidetti doesn’t sign then what message does that send out to the Celtic fans?

‘I think it is important that Celtic show intent and do try to get Commons and Guidetti signed up, and then add to that if possible. I know we have to be realistic in the marketplace that Celtic are buying from, but that is the challenge.’

Commons, Scotland’s reigning Player of the Year, is out of contract at the end of the season. Discussions over an extension have so far failed to bear fruit and English clubs — including Crystal Palace and Leicester City — are circling ahead of the January transfer window.

At 31, Commons is hardly in the first flush of youth. There will be precious little resale value — the commodity which helps fuel Celtic’s business plan — if he were to stay for another couple of seasons.

Sutton, however, is adamant that accepting a fee next month — or watching him exit as a free agent — would be the falsest of economies.

‘I don’t think Celtic can afford to let him go,’ he maintained. ‘Because who do they get to replace him?

‘I know this season he has not really got going through no fault of his own but he has still shown, in the Zagreb game for example, that he has the class to turn a game.

‘Now Celtic don’t have enough of those players. Whatever you say about Stefan Johansen, he is not as good a footballer — he might have better legs but Commons can still change a game at the top level.

‘Why would you want to let him go? It’s common sense — unless his wage demands are off the planet, which I doubt they are. Celtic are making an enormous mistake if they don’t get him signed.

‘The longer it goes, you can imagine Kris sitting there thinking: “Well, if they are not going to show willing to me — a player who has given good service, Player of the Year last year, 32 goals and the most aware player Celtic have... ”

‘It did happen in my time, it happened to me, and there is a point where the player wants something back.

‘I am not party to what has happened in the talks but it looks to me like Celtic are going to lose Kris Commons.

‘I hope they don’t but the longer it goes, the more it looks like he will be heading down south.’

Guidetti’s future is open to equal speculation. With 10 goals in 11 appearances since joining on loan from Manchester City, the super-confident Swede is the kind of striker Parkhead season-ticket holders have hankered after for years.

The problem, of course, is that this return to the prolific form he once exhibited at Feyenoord is attracting attention south of Gretna Green.

It seems likely that more lucrative offers will be available elsewhere, but Sutton believes there would be wisdom in compromising financial interests.

‘Both parties suit each other,’ he said. ‘It’s been good for John Guidetti coming to Celtic and they are a different team with him in it.

‘He has that goal-scoring threat which maybe no other centre-forward at the club has.

‘He can score all different types of goals. Imagine Celtic getting through to the latter stages of the Europa League and they have him to come in? That’s a massive boost.

‘Guidetti might have other options. But sometimes when you have it good, and I know this from my own experience, you should not underestimate that. I hope he does sign, I think on balance he will sign — he would be stupid not to.’

Celtic may have to stretch their existing wage structure to reach a happy outcome. Sutton sees no issue with that and is dismissive of the argument that it could cause dressing-room unrest.

‘Listen, Henrik Larsson deserved to be the best-paid player at Celtic in my time because he was the best player,’ said Sutton.

‘It’s ridiculous for players to bother about what other players are on. If John Guidetti comes in on a big wage and he scores a few goals and does well for Celtic, at home and in Europe, then he deserves his wages. I don’t think that is an issue.

‘If it is an issue then you have the wrong people in the dressing-room.’

Sutton has been fiercely critical of some of Celtic’s displays under Ronny Deila this term, branding the laboured home win over Astra Giurgiu last month as ‘pathetic’.

Thursday, he feels, will bring a stern test of the progress made since then. Sutton would not be surprised to see Salzburg make the Europa League Final in Warsaw.

‘I have just been truthful,’ argued Sutton. ‘In terms of where Celtic should be judged, for me it is the Europa League.

‘It would be an enormous achievement for them to qualify. When you look at recent domestic games, including Saturday’s win over Dundee, they have enough to play mediocre games and still win the Scottish league.

‘But if they don’t put on a performance in this one then they will get drubbed because they (Salzburg) are the best team Celtic will have played this season.

‘Salzburg have improved a lot since Celtic played well in Austria. I think they lost a game after that 2-2 draw but since then they have won 11 out of 13. I know Celtic had a tough time against Legia Warsaw but I think Salzburg are a better team.’
