Military veterans and active-duty service members were among the hundreds of thousands of music fans who packed the National Mall on Tuesday for a free Veterans Day concert starring Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna and Eminem. 

The first-of-its-kind Concert for Valor, staged by HBO, Starbucks and Chase Corp., was intended to raise awareness for issues affecting veterans. 

While official crowd estimates were unavailable, organizers were expecting hundreds of thousands of people, making it one of the biggest events of the year on the Mall.

Bruce Springsteen was joined by Dave Grohl and Zac Brown to cover  Vietnam-era anthem, Fortunate Son - a decision that received a mixed reaction on Twitter

'What an amazing way to celebrate veterans on Veterans Day,' said Jack Black, one of the concert's hosts.

While tickets were free, the celebrity hosts directed fans to ways they can volunteer or donate money to causes helping war veterans. Some in the audience said the gesture had symbolic importance.

'This is the first time since I've been back that I've felt honored to be back home, and I'm 65 years old,' said Bobby Monk, a disabled Vietnam veteran from Washington who wore a gray Army T-shirt. 

'They treated us like criminals when we came back home. They didn't give us a parade.'

Jennifer Hudson kicked off the event appropriately with a powerful rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner, a performance reminiscent of Whitney Houston's during the 1991 Super Bowl.

Carrie Underwood was a popular performer at the concert which could become an annual event

She was followed by a recorded message from President Barack Obama that told the immense crowd: 'Let's all find ways...to serve these heroes as well as they've served us.'

The massive crowd was then energized by Rihanna's anthem Diamonds and an ear-splitting set by Metallica, a longtime favorite of soldiers. 

Springsteen was more subdued, standing alone with an acoustic guitar to play a ruminative version of Born in the U.S.A., about a disillusioned Vietnam veteran. 

Earlier, Springsteen joined Grohl and the Zac Brown Band to cover another Vietnam-era anthem, Fortunate Son. 

The appropriateness of singing a counterculture era anti-war anthem that criticizes militant patriotic behavior was questioned by a number of people on Twitter.

'Maybe it's just me but Fortunate Son seems to be an inappropriate song to play at the Concert For Valor,' tweeted Jay Caruso. 

'Leave it to Hollywood to insult those who serve on Veterans Day,' tweeted Ted Newton.

Eminem, wearing a camouflage hoodie, dropped several expletives before closing the show with his empowering Lose Yourself, again to the ire of many on Twitter.

Other performers included Carrie Underwood, the Black Keys and Jessie J.

In between the singers, extraordinary veterans were honored in video tributes hosted by Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, among others. 

Some of the subjects appeared onstage, including Leroy Petry, a Medal of Honor recipient who lost his right hand while serving in Iraq. 

Petry helped inspire Starbucks president Howard Schultz to write a book about veterans and pledge to hire at least 10,000 former service members.

Comedian John Oliver, whose wife is a former U.S. Army combat medic, said he's seen firsthand the difficulties that returning veterans go through.

'It's kind of staggering, the dislocation over the past decade between the civilian population and the military,' he said. 'It offends me on a personal level.'

The concert was televised live by HBO, which made its signal available to non-subscribers. Online streaming was also available. HBO chief executive Richard Plepler said it was possible that the concert could become an annual event.

Schultz said he hoped the concert would help more Americans recognize the importance of welcoming post-9/11 veterans back to civilian life.

'Veterans Day comes once a year. Unfortunately, at times, it's turned into an annual weekend sale,' Schultz said. 'That's not what it's about.'
