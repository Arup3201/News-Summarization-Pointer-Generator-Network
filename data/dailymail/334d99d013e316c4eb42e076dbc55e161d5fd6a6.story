Somewhere in New England, a teen knows a brutal death grows closer with each day.

That little boy, Austin Leclaire, 13, is stricken with an illness that, in time, will choke his breath and stop his heart - and for which there is no marketable cure.

Now compound Austin's heartbreak, as he must watch as his brother, Max, who has the same rare form of muscular dystrophy, grows stronger each day from a clinical trial for which the maker of the drug says he is ineligible.

Two brothers, one illness: Vermont boys Austin and Max Leclaire are both stricken with a rare, congenital form of muscular dystrophy

Every day, as Austin's life slowly slips away, Max's life slowly returns.

'My brother says he's doing (the clinical trial) for me, that he's trying really hard,' Austin courageously told ABCNews.com in a recent interview. 'That's why he wanted to do it.'

As for Sarepta Therapeutics, and official with the company told ABCNews.com that getting Austin treatment represents a maze of regulatory and financial obstacles. Austin was reportedly initially barred from the trial because he can no longer walk.

'This remains a priority for us,' Dr. Edward M. Kaye, Sarepta's chief medical officer, reportedly wrote. But, Kaye added, 'This is a challenging request since it involves complex regulatory, political, manufacturing, and fiscal issues."

The Leclaire brothers were both born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which reportedly affects one in 3,500 male births.

About 20,000 children in the U.S. and 300,000 worldwide develop the illness, ABCNews.com quoted Cure Duchenne as saying. The organization is one of three that have funded Sarepta's clinical trial.

The disease strikes between the ages of 3 and 5, ABCNews.com wrote.

Affected boys slowly lose the ability to walk. In time, they need a wheelchair and, like Austin, cannot even raise their arms high enough to place food in their mouth, according to the site. Later, patients' require tracheotomies and other forms of respiratory assistance. Eventually, the heart and lungs fail.

Max was cleared for the clinical trial of an experimental drug, while his older brother, Austin, was deemed ineligible because he could no longer walk

'This can happen in any family,' said Jenn Mcnary, the boys 32-year-old stepmother, reportedly said, adding of her efforts to implore Sarepta to grant Austin the same wonder drug that has helped Max, 'I have been getting very vague answers. I keep getting the same answer. They tell me to be patient.'

Doctors diagnosed Austin with Duchenne muscular dystrophy at 3 years old, when Max was already 3 months old, according to ABCNews.com.

While Max has slowly improved through participation in the clinical trial, Austin, pictured in his wheelchair, is slowly wasting away.

However, for the last year, Max has received the drug, eteplirsen, whereas Austin has not. Max's condition has slowly improved. He can now climb a hill in the family's Saxtons River, Vt. backyard. Austin, meanwhile, can no longer feed himself.

'I am clearly happy for Max because he is doing so well and exceeding our expectations,' Jenn Mcnary reportedly said. 'But it's taking much longer than we ever thought for the drug company to at least grant access to his brother [Austin] who is sitting home watching his brother get treatment.'

A genetic mutation is responsible for the terminal - and congenital - illness, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, which strikes 1-in-3,500 males

Once researchers realized that the drug's efficacy, they put all 12 of the study's subjects on the treatment. Some had previously been given a placebo.

The children on the highest dose of the drug have made great strides, Mcnary told ABCNews.com. Meanwhile, Sarepta Therapeutics, for its part, reportedly wrote in a statement, it '... understands the urgent need of boys with DMD and their families,' but cannot publicly speak about patients in its clinical trials.

'We have aligned with the DMD community in the fight against this disease for many years...,' the statement reportedly said. 'Our priority is to gather and analyze the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase IIb study, which will form the basis of discussions with the FDA to determine the most appropriate path for eteplirsen.'

Austin can no longer lift a glass of milk, or drag his weary body from bed to wheelchair.

Mcnary and her husband, Craig, who runs a Roto-Rooter franchise, have been talking to whomever will listen, ABCNews.com wrote. For the past six months, they have been emailing Sarepta's executives on Austin's behalf. 

'I am like a broken record,' Mcnary told the website. 'I congratulate the drug company who are now public and doing well. Their stocks are going up. We are not just looking out for Austin.

'We have a lot of friends in the (muscular dystrophy) community. People are losing their upper body strength just waiting for this. This is urgent right now.'
