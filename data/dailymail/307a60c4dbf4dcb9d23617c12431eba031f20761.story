A little girl's trip to Disney World didn't turned out as magical as she expected when she was sent crashing to the ground after being hit by a dancer.

Melissa Browning said her four-year-old daughter was dancing alongside Disney characters in a costumed parade at the Magical Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida, during a family trip.

As her parents filmed her enjoying herself, one of the official dancers with the parade accidentally smashes her in the head with his hand.

Video shot by Melissa shows her four year old daughter being sent flying backwards and crashing the ground.

The dancer, dressed in a bright shirt and white trousers, swings his arm back catching the young girl directly in the face.

Nearby him is a Donald Duck character dancing with a group of children.

The camera suddenly goes out of focus as Melissa rushes to comfort her daughter and she can be heard saying: 'Oh my God.'

Melissa toldÂ WKMG TV that the dancer apologized, before continuing with the parade. The child was reportedly knocked out in the incident, according to the station.

But she said Disney failed to get in touch with her after she emailed them about the incident.

She said her daughter was left with a bruising around her eye for several days.

Melissa posted the video on YouTube with the warning: 'Don't let your little ones dance in Disney parades.'

She wrote:'I was very worried when it happened though. She had a purple eye for a few days. No Disney did not respond to the accident or to my email later. The dancer did apologize but then kept dancing so we were a very stunned and surprised.'

Melissa said the family returned to their home in Louisiana the same day of the incident.

A spokesman for Disney has not made any comment.
