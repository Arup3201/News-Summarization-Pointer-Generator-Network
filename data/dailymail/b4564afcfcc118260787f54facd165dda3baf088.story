Accidentally exposing yourself in pictures posted on eBay may sound like a tricky thing to do - but it appears to happen much more frequently than you would think.

These embarrassing images were all posted online for the world to see by eBay sellers who thought it was a good idea to take pictures of their merchandise in the nude.

Unfortunately for them, their reflections have been caught in mirrors, CD covers, TV and computer screens as they took pictures for the website.

One eBay seller even managed to capture his entirely naked body in the reflection of a metal kettle but his manhood was strategically covered by his tripod and camera.

And once these photos go up online, it won't be long before some eagle-eyed shoppers spot the blunder, as eBay seller Aimi Jones recently discovered.

The 21-year-old had accidentally included a naked view of herself when she posted a picture of a dress for sale on the website.

She hung the mustard yellow skater dress by ASOS on her wardrobe door to photograph it for listing.

A cheeky shot: This photographer didn't seem to notice someone exposing themselves in the background of the picture

But when viewing the picture, she failed to notice her own reflection in the door mirror, camera in hand, and in just a black bra and no knickers.

The post soon went viral and despite Miss Jones' attempt to have it removed, it is now all over the internet.

Miss Jones, from Oxfordshire, told The Sun: 'It's so embarrassing. It is such a dizzy, stupid thing to do and now the whole world's seen me in the nude.

'I put it on eBay last Saturday morning and realised straight away so ended the sale. But what I didn't realise was that people could still it on the site.

Not the sharpest image: A seller tries to demonstrate the quality of the TV but ends up also sharing the contents of their living room

Snap happy: This seller got so carried away with taking pictures for the site, they failed to notice the very clear naked view of themselves

'I reported it to eBay and they took it down, but by then it had gone viral. My boyfriend Andy thinks the whole thing is hilarious.'

The blunder sparked a flurry of fake eBay sale ads for the yellow dress with fictional characters accidentally making an appearance earlier this week.

One eBay user went to the added effort of posting several pictures featuring James McAvoy in his role as Mr Tumnus in the first Chronicles of Narnia film modelling the yellow dress

The original image and mock-ups have since been shared on Twitter with the hash tag #ebayyellowskaterdress. 

Mirror, mirror: Aimi Jones, from Oxfordshire, did not realise she had captured herself half-naked in a mirror when she snapped the dress to sell on eBay

Bit more demure: She re-listed the item on eBay 
and this time covered up with a black coat. It attracted bids of 
£153, 911 after the original picture went viral
