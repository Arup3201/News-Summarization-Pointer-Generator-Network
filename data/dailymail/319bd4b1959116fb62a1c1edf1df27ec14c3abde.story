An 88-year-old Florida woman was arrested over the weekend following an alleged altercation that left her 87-year-old husband beaten and bruised.

Police were first alerted to Charles Earle's sad state by a nurse at a Volusia County hospital Saturday after he was driven there for treatment by his wife Charlene.

Both he and his 4-foot-11 wife, deputies discovered, were covered in bruises. 

Charlene Earle was charged Saturday with beating her 87-year-old husband Charles

Neither Charles nor Charlene would give police a statement. They said only that they couldn't remember how the fight had begun.

According to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Mr. Earle was described he and his wife as 'mutual combatants.'

However, it was his wife who police charged with battery on a person older than 65, a felony.

Her husband was found with bruises and cuts on his arm that police wrote were caused by Charlene 'clawing his arm with her fingernails.'

Police said he also had evidence of faded, older injuries which he told them were from previous fights with his wife, the News-Journal reports. 

Police also noted that Charlene had bruises and abrasions on her face and chest.

She was released Sunday on her own recognizance.
