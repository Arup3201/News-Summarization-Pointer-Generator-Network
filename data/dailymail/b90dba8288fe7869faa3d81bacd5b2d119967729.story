OneKind says Edinburgh Zoo is exploiting the pandas for cash under the guise of conservation

An animal protection charity has condemned Edinburgh Zoo for offering visitors the chance to become panda keepers - if they stump up £1,000 for an hour. 

OneKind, an Edinburgh-based animal protection charity, has called the scheme ‘exploitative’ and claim it is a money spinning scheme thinly-veiled as a conservation project.

The new 'experience' was launched 
yesterday and provides panda fans with the opportunity of a private, 
after hours, encounter with the UK's only giant pandas.

A OneKind spokesman said: ‘As much as it’s portrayed as a conservation project, this is a commercial exercise and these pandas are being exploited to generate revenue for the zoo.

‘Our primary concern is the welfare of the pandas and we would expect that because the zoo has a large financial stake in their well-being, they will do their utmost to ensure they don’t come to any harm.

'We would urge the zoo to demonstrate how the pandas will be protected from any physical or psychological pressure that may be caused by this process.

‘It’s quite an obscene amount of money to ask for in the current economic climate and it seems almost a throwback to the Victorian era when animals were used as entertainment. It’s a bit tacky.

‘The pandas are the property of the Chinese government and we hope they have consulted with them about exploiting the animals in this way.

‘If people love pandas that much, would it not be better to donate that money to conservation efforts to protect their habitat?’

Visitors can now get up close to female Tian Tian (Sweetie) and male Yang Guang (Sunshine) for the first time but for a fee.

The zoo is offering the hour long panda keeper experience at £1,000 for up to four people, where visitors can meet the creatures which spend up to 14 hours a day sleeping.

Customers are being charged per panda keeper experience meaning that at it's lowest, the 'experience' costs £250 per person if four people are using it - they same amount charged for a full day keeper experience with other animals.

At its highest, the keeper experience will still cost £1,000 even if only one person uses it.

A half an hour rhino keeper experience will only cost you £70, as does an owl, lemur or 'creepy crawly' keeper experience.

A spokeswoman for Edinburgh Zoo said: 'Launching Panda Keeper Experiences is not about extra income.

'To date we have welcomed over 400,000 people to visit the giant pandas at Edinburgh Zoo and in terms of projections made before their arrival, we are happy with the numbers. 

'Similar experiences take place in zoos around with world with pandas, including China, and are extremely exclusive and limited experiences, with only around 2 to 4 taking place each month.

'It is important to remember that RZSS is a charity and receives no external funding and that our conservation programmes, including panda support, are achieved because of funds from our zoo activities and how they uniquely reconnect people with vanishing nature.

'Conservation remains one of the RZSS key goals regarding giant pandas and is at the heart of everything we do.'

Feed me! The experience is designed for people over the age of 16 and offers a chance to get close to the Chinese imports

The adorable, clumsy creatures have been a hit feature of Edinburgh Zoo - despite sleeping for about 14 hours a day

The giant pandas arrived at Edinburgh Zoo from China in December 2011 - the first pandas kept in Britain since 1994.

The Giant Panda project is funded entirely from charitable donations from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland.

The zoo pays the Chinese government £660,000 a year to house the black and white pair, poured £285,000 into building a special enclosure for them, and spends £70,000 a year on bamboo imported from Holland for them, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Darren McGarry, Head of Animals at Edinburgh Zoo, said: 'We're delighted to be able to offer people the chance to get closer than ever before to these fascinating, rare and iconic animals.

Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is 99 per cent bamboo.

Pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. 

The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.

As a result of farming, deforestation and other development, the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.

The panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.

'Our panda keeper experiences, which will last around an hour, are exclusive opportunities for panda fans.

'Unique private encounters, people will be able to see the giant pandas at very close proximity in the private area of their enclosure - which isn't on show to the public.

'The private audience with our keepers will also give the chance to really learn first-hand more about Tian Tian and Yang Guang.

'We hope people really enjoy and treasure this incredible and truly rare once in a lifetime experience with our giant pandas.'

The panda keeper experience allows visitors to meet one of the panda keepers and learn about the training with the pandas.

Visitors may also have the chance to feed the pandas and they will receive drinks and canapes on the panda walkway.

It had been hoped that the pair would breed cubs but attempts to encourage any romance between them has failed so far.

The keepers built private rooms linked by a tunnel for Tian Tian and Yang Guang so they could take advantage of the only 36 hour window when a female panda ovulates, but so far the duo remain just good friends.

Meanwhile, the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has urged the zoo to take all possible steps to ensure the well-being of both the pandas and the guests.

Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: 'The biosecurity and safety of both the animals and humans is paramount therefore we would expect Edinburgh Zoo to have taken all the necessary precautions to ensure these experiences are conducted in an appropriate manner.'

Panda keeper experiences run are designed for people aged 16 years and over.
