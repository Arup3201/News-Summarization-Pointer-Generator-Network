Two brothers - one aged just 16 - have been charged with the murder of former Royal Marine Carl Davies, 33, after he plunged 30ft down a cliff on  
Reunion island in the Indian Ocean.

Police thought Mr Davies, from 
Sittingbourne in Kent, had fallen to his death on November 9, 2011, but a post mortem examination has now revealed that he was stabbed and beaten with a bat before being pushed.

Mr Davies was working as a security guard on a ship
at Reunion at the time of his death. He had been employed to combat the
threat of piracy on the island.

A 16-year-old and his 26-year-old brother have been 
formally accused, after appearing before a judge on the island on 
Thursday.

The brothers were among six men detained by French authorities after the lengthy investigation into Mr Davies death.

Other defendants were due to appear in court on Friday.

His parents, Andrew and Maria Davies from Harrietsham, near 
Maidstone, have been battling for 14 agonising months to win justice for their 
son.

They were forced to launch a petition as they campaigned for the police on the island to act.

Andrew, 53, a decorator, said 'We have no plans to go out there at the moment, but, if there is a trial, then we will.'

'The police have demonstrated to us that they are still in control and still trying to find the perpetrators.'

'For many months, we doubted they were making a serious attempt and they have proved us wrong.'

The family said that they understood that two out of 
six suspects had already been formally charged.

Speaking a week after Carl's death, his father said: 'The thought of him falling and dying has caused us great pain.'

'But despite our heartbreak, we had started to grieve - and now we 
find out that we have been lied to, that Carl was murdered. It is too 
much'Â 

'There has been a serious cover up - a catalogue of lies. The French
authorities do not want anyone to know that he has been murdered as 
they don't want to damage tourism.'

'But we want to know the truth and for Carl to be brought home so that we can lay him to rest.'

'He might have been a big, strapping Marine, but he was still my baby boy.'

Carl had served as a soldier in Northern Ireland and Iraq.
