This is the moment a cyclist comes within feet 
of certain death as he pedals down the hard shoulder of Europe's 
busiest motorway at rush hour after following his iPhone navigation app 
onto the M25.

Seemingly oblivious to the danger he 
is putting himself in the man, dressed in a black jacket and khaki trousers, twice crosses slip roads exiting and 
entering the motorway.

CCTV operators called police after spotting the unnamed rider pedalling along the hard shoulder between Junction 10 for the A3 and Junction 11 for Chertsey at around 8.30am today.

When he was stopped the man told police he had been trying to find a shortcut home and was following an iPhone app

A Surrey Police officer was sent ahead to stop the cyclist at Junction 13 near Staines.

The man told police he had been directed
 onto the busy motorwa  m y by his phone while trying to find a shortcut 
home after finishing a night shift.

He was pulled over by Sergeant Phil Dix, from Surrey Police Roads Policing Unit, who said: 'The cyclist was apparently taking a short cut home and was following a satellite navigation system on his mobile phone.

'It is extremely fortunate that there was a safe outcome and that the cyclist was not injured, or worse – especially as he had crossed several slip roads coming off the motorway.

Police eventually stopped the cyclist but not before he had ridden several miles along the motorway

The cyclist, who said he didn't realise it was against the law to ride on the road, was given a £50 fine

'This is a good example of why motorists should always remain alert and vigilant on the roads as you never know what you may come across on your travels.

'I would urge all road users to use a common sense approach when using a satnav, whether that be on foot, two wheels or more.'

Route

Officers issued the stunned cyclist with
 a £50 penalty ticket before they put him in their patrol car and
 took him off the motorway to resume his journey home.

He told police he had followed a map app on his phone as he wanted to find a shorter way home from his work.

A spokesman for Surrey Roads Policing 
team said the cyclist had apparently thought it would be okay to ride on
 the motorway after the phone app sent him down the slip road.

'Cyclist
 stopped and after a long conversation he has been safely removed with 
his copy of his ticket for £50 pounds,' an officer for the traffic team 
tweeted.

'Male was looking for
 a shorter route to cycle home from work.

'Phone app sent him on motorway
 so thought it okay. £50 fine

'Nice chap but unaware of the rules of the road. Believed it okay to ride/walk on hard shoulder - struggled to see why not.

'This chap cycled several miles between junctions.'

The commotion also caused frustration to commuters on their route to work with some reporting being delayed by almost an hour.

Hannah Leonard tweeted: 'My usual 40 minute commute to work took an hour and a half due to a cyclist on the M25!'

Dez Leach, Highways Agency Operations Manager said: 'Thankfully this was a rare event.

'Safety is our top priority and as soon as we were alerted to the incident this morning, we assisted the police to monitor the cyclist and slow traffic when necessary.'
