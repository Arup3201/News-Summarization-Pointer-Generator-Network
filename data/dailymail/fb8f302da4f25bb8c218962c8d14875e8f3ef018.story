These grisly photographs show how a hospital worker found a live maggot crawling on her Nutri-Grain bar she was about to eat for breakfast.

Lisa Seymour, of Cambridge, said she was shocked to find the creature ‘wriggling on top’ of the Kellogg’s cereal bar after opening it at the weekend - seconds before she would have eaten it.

The 29-year-old - who was offered just £4 compensation from the company when she complained on Monday - said the experience has put her off Nutri-Grain bars for life.

Miss Seymour told MailOnline today: ‘It came in an Asda delivery and it was in a multipack, so I'd already eaten two in the packet. Then I went to eat at the weekend for breakfast.

‘You don't really look at it before you eat it - but when I was about to take a bite, I saw the maggot wriggling on top. I felt sick that I’d nearly eaten it, but also that I could have eaten one in the others.’

She added that she immediately contacted Kellogg’s customer services, who were ‘apologetic’ but insisted that the maggot would not have got into the bar during the production process.

Miss Seymour was then offered £4 in Kellogg’s vouchers, but added: ‘I don't want to take the vouchers as I don't want to eat Kellogg’s products at the moment.

‘I didn’t feel like my complaint was taken seriously - I’d found maggots in my bar, it wasn't like it was mouldy. I would never eat a Nutri-Grain bar again, and I would be wary of Kellogg’s products.’ 

It comes two months after project coordinator Nick Todd, 22, from London, said he was 'nearly sick' after finding a live maggot in a Nutri-Grain bar - claiming it put him off Kellogg's products for life. 

Probe: Kellogg’s said it is asking the customer to return the bar to it so an investigation can be carried out

Looking into it: The company insisted it was taking the complaint about the Nutri-Grain bar 'very seriously'

In the box: High temperatures used in the making of the bars mean a maggot could not survive, the firm said

After that incident, Kellogg's pledged to carry out a ‘full and thorough investigation’ into how the maggot was able to get into the food, adding that it took the complaint ‘very seriously’.

A spokesman for the firm said at the time that it was 'extremely unlikely' the maggot entered the cereal bar in the factory 'because of the high temperatures involved in the production process'. 

And a Kellogg's spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Kellogg’s is taking this complaint very seriously. We are asking the consumer to return the bar to us so that a full investigation can be carried out.

‘However, in the last consumer complaint of this nature we dealt with in November, the investigation showed that the high temperatures used in the manufacture of Nutri-Grain bars meant such a specimen could not possibly have survived the production process.

‘Any infestation would have occurred after the bar was produced. Our pest control contractor did not find any issue relating to pest activity, nor were there any other complaints of this type during the production period.’

Miss Seymour,  originally from Diss in Norfolk, is a medical laboratory assistant in the microbiology department at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. An Asda spokesman declined to comment.
