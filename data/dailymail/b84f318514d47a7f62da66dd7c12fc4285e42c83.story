A massive wildfire that have been raging for a week in Washington state has destroyed more than 370 square miles of dry timber and grasslands and left a trail of destruction including dead cattle and hundreds of displaced people.

Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers estimates that 150 homes have been destroyed, but suspects that number could be higher. His deputies haven't been able to search parts of the county where homes are spread miles apart.

Ten people remained unaccounted for as of Sunday, though Rogers said that could reflect outages of phone service.

No serious injuries have been reported, but hundreds of people have been forced to evacuate in several towns and rural areas in north-central Washington.

There are nearly 1,400 firefighters battling the flames, assisted by more than 100 fire engines, helicopters dropping buckets of water and planes spreading flame retardant.

The wildfire finally showed some sign of calming on Sunday, the first time since it was triggered by lightning strikes six days ago that it showed any sign of abatement, local officials said.

‘It's the first time in four days I've seen blue sky,’ said Rogers, who drove to the town of Twisp on Sunday to survey the damage. ‘Every day, when you got up, it was nothing but smoke. All we've seen of the sun is a red ball.’

John Johnson returns to clear out and salvage remnants of his burned down home on Chiliwist Road, after the Carlton Complex fire burned through the valley, near Malott, Wash.

By early Sunday, the fire was still burning over 280,000 acres in Washington’s Methow Valley, about 120 miles northeast of Seattle, but its perimeters were not expanding.

‘It seems to be calming down a whole lot,’ said Rogers. ‘The weather is definitely a help. It's cooled down a whole lot. It's also burning out in some areas.’

Cooler temperatures and lighter winds are forecast to helping firefighters in wildfire-stricken north-central Washington in the coming days.

While Sunday's weather has slight improvements on the hot temperatures and gusty winds that have fueled the wildfires, the forecast for Monday and Tuesday calls for lighter winds and temperatures, said Spokane-based National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Koch.

‘Overall, it looks like the weather scenario is improving,’ Koch said.

Then on Wednesday a ‘vigorous’ front is expected to cover Washington, bringing rain to much of the state. But it will also bring lighting, he added.

‘The benefits of the system are still up in the air,’ Koch said. ‘We may get some rain where we need it, but we may also experience some lighting that could cause some new ignitions.’

Although the weather is improving, the towns in the scenic Methow Valley remain without power and have limited landline and cellphone service.

Okanogan County Public Utility District officials told KREM that fully restoring power to the area could take weeks.

Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday about 50 fires were burning in Washington, which has been wracked by hot, dry weather, gusting winds and lightning.

About 2,000 firefighters were working in the eastern part of the state, with about a dozen helicopters from the Department of Natural Resources and the National Guard, along with a Washington State Patrol spotter plane.

Karina Shagren, spokeswoman for the state's Military Department, said 100 National Guard troops were on standby, and up to 1,000 more in Yakima could receive additional fire training. Active-duty military could be called in as well, Inslee said.

The Washington state Department of Natural Resources announced on Saturday evening that firefighters from New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming are coming to the state to help.

Early on Saturday, authorities announced that they were bringing in two military air tankers from Wyoming to help fight wildfires in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere.

Officials at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said the tankers were activated to ensure that firefighters had adequate air tanker capability in the region.

The wildfire was one of about 18 burning across the Pacific Northwest, from northern California to Idaho, amid drought-like conditions that have made the region's annual fire season more active than usual. The governors of Oregon and Washington each declared fire emergencies last week.
