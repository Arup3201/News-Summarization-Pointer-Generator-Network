Bin men crushed a dog to death in a rubbish truck in Greece as screaming schoolchildren begged them to stop.

Almost 37,000 people have signed an online petition demanding punishment for the workers, who they say killed the animal deliberately.

However, officials in Patras, in the west of Greece, say it was an 'unfortunate' accident and workers had not seen the stray dog.

According to the petition, witnesses said one worker saw the dog and said: 'Aren't you gonna get out of there? Well I'll show you'.

They then emptied more rubbish into the truck and put it through a crushing machine, it has been claimed.

The petition has been signed by people across Europe and animal lovers from as far afield as South Africa, Saudi Arabia and even Afghanistan.

The Achaean Association For The Welfare Of Animals has made an official complaint.
