Road crash deaths in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level since 1949 - despite Americas driving more, figures have revealed.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said highway deaths hit a six decade low of 32,885 in 2010.

That's a 2.9 per cent drop from 2009 even though Americans drove three trillion miles in 2010 - almost 46 billion more miles than in 2009.

However, figures also showed texting while driving increased 50 per
cent last year as two out of 10 drivers say they've sent text messages 
or emails while behind the wheel.

The jump comes despite a rush by 
states to ban the practice amid safety concerns about diverting drivers'
focus away from the road.

Drivers were using Web-capable smart 
phones or cell phones to view travel directions, check e-mails or 
calendar appointments, or surf the Internet, manual dialing, playing 
hand-held games, and holding phones in front of their faces.

Overall, the activity increased to 0.9 per cent of drivers, up from 0.6 per cent the previous year.

DoT secretary Ray LaHood
said: 'While we have more work to do to continue to protect American 
motorists, these numbers show we're making historic progress when it 
comes to improving safety on our nation's roadways.'

Industry representatives cited 
several contributing factors for the drop, such as graduated license 
programs for young drivers, hands-free cell phone laws and stiffer drunk
driving penalties.

Ignorance of youth: The rate of drivers that text jumps dramatically when looking solely at people between the ages of 21 and 24

Warnings: The number of driver fatalities actually dropped even though more people are texting and more people are driving longer

Jake Nelson, director of traffic 
safety advocacy and research at AAA, said: 'Safer vehicles, safer roads 
and safer drivers as a result of traffic-safety policies that have been 
implemented over the last few years are certainly contributors.

'It's the combination of all these factors that have given us the results we're seeing today.'

But Mr Nelson warned: 'Distracted driving has become a much
bigger issue in the last few years.

'The measure 
they'll now report will be a better indicator of the true impact 
distractions have on traffic crashes.

'The challenge is to identify the 
areas where we're making the greatest gains and leveraging those to see 
the numbers drop even further.'

Figures showed deaths in crashes involving drunk 
drivers dropped 4.9 per cent in 2010, resulting in 10,228 fatalities 
compared to 10,759 in 2009.

Deaths among young drivers aged 16 to 20 have also dropped 39 per cent over the last five years, compared to a 23 
per cent drop in the general population.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administrator David Strickland said: 'Even
as we celebrate the incredible gains we're making in reducing traffic 
fatalities, we recognise our responsibility to improve our understanding
of the dangers that continue to threaten drivers and passengers.

'That's why, under the leadership of 
Secretary LaHood, NHTSA is working to refine the way we collect data on 
distracted driving and laying the groundwork for additional research to 
capture real-world information on this risky behavior.'
