Motorists are being driven round the twist by a set of wiggly white lines in the middle of a road.

The meandering markings are meant to be part of a new ‘traffic-calming’ scheme through the village of Arnprior in Scotland.

They match up with red indentations that have been painted at the roadside to slow vehicles down.

But some drivers say they look like the work of a drunk - and an opposition councillor claimed they cost 50 per cent more than conventional straight lines.

Drivers have been left scratching their heads by the wiggly road calming scheme in the Scottish village of Arnprior. SNP councillor Ian Muirhead, a local farmer, said they were 'ineffective' and 'look stupid'

Long and winding road: A tractor navigates the bizarre traffic calming measures. Labour councillor Danny Gibson defended the scheme, saying there were also 'speed limit signs and speed activating warning signs'

SNP councillor Ian Muirhead, who farms locally, said: 'In common with many residents, I find the wiggly lines to be not only ineffective but also look stupid.

'They were put in place as a supposed traffic calming measure by the council roads department.

'I think the idea is that people see the wobbly lines and assume it’s going to be a bumpy road so they slow down.

'But many people have said it just looks like they were painted by a drunken road worker.

The lines appeared on the A811 between Stirling and Loch Lomond, but did not please everyone

'To add insult to injury the cost of wiggly lines as opposed to straight lines is considerably more - up to 50 per cent extra.

'In these times of austerity, priority should be given to basic road maintenance over excessive traffic-calming gimmicks.'

Another local, a 68-year-old woman 
who asked not to be named, said: 'It’s completely daft. Some older 
people used to try to follow the lines and it drove them potty.

'There
are indents at the sides of the road and the white lines correspond 
with them rather than going down the middle of the road where they 
should be.'

The lines were painted on the A811 between Stirling and Loch Lomond, where the speed limit reduces to 30mph.

Labour councillor and roads spokesman Danny Gibson said: 'These lines were installed as part of agreed speed reduction measures.

'The centre line markings are complemented by red road markings at the side of the carriageway.

'The combination of road markings influence driver behaviour and encourage a reduction in vehicle speed.

'The speed reduction measures also include count-down size, speed limit signs and speed activating warning signs.

'We have not been contacted by any local residents or road users to express any concerns about these markings.'

Wobbly blunder or success? Opinions are split on the scheme, which was put in for safety reasons
