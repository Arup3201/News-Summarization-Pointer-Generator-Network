She gave her life to the silver screen, jumping to her death from the 'H' of the Hollywood sign at just 24 years old.

Now, 82 years later, struggling actress Peg Entwistle is finally getting a starring role as it is revealed her life will be the subject of a new blockbuster. 

The tale of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed comedienne who desperately wanted to be given serious roles will be told by Rush Hour producer Arthur Sarkissian and American History X director Tony Kaye.

Starlet: The story of Peg Entwistle who jumped to her death from the Hollywood sign will be made into a movie

Tragic: The 24-year-old was found in a ravine at the base of the sign, which then read Hollywoodland, on September 18, 1932, by a hiker. She left a purse, jacket, and a note which read: 'I am afraid, I am a coward'

And with plans to style her story on Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, it seems Entwistle will finally be recognised as the femme fatale she dreamed of being.

The movie will immortalise a myth which has captured the imagination of film anoraks around the world for decades.

She started her career with success on Broadway, starring in a string of highly-acclaimed plays between 1925 and 1932.

Critics revered her performances in The Wild Duck and The Uninvited Guest and in J.M. Barrie’s Alice Sit By The Fire.

Even a young Bette Davis is reported to have said she wanted to be like Entwistle after watching her in an Ibsen play.

But her personal life took a dark turn after she married Guys & Dolls actor Robert Keith in 1927 as he later revealed he had a six-year-old son with another woman. They divorced in 1929. 

Entwistle, who many say likely suffered from depression, was still a darling of the critics in New York.

Many reviews touted her acting as 'better than the show warranted'.  

Finally, in May 1932, she landed a serious supporting role in a play opposite Humphrey Bogart in downtown LA.

She then secured her first film role as a minor character in Thirteen Women - widely regarded as the first female ensemble movie.

But on September 18, a month before the film opened on October 14, she was found dead.

Blockbuster: The film of her life will be styled on Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, according to the movie crew

She left a jacket, shoes and a purse at the foot of the sign, which then read Hollywoodland, and a note.

It read: 'I am afraid, I am a coward. I am sorry for everything. If I had done this a long time ago, it would have saved a lot of pain. P.E.' 

She was identified by her uncle who read her story in a newspaper.

Decades later, hundreds flock to the sign each year to pay tribute to Entwistle, who many claim haunts the hill.
