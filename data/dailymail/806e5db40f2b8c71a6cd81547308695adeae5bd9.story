The handwritten notes which saved the lives of the astronauts on the  Apollo 13 mission are set to fetch £60,000 at auction.

The notes, made famous by the hit 1995 film starring Tom Hanks, were used by Commander Jim Lovell to work out how to perform a vital 'burn' on the way back to Earth.

If Commander Lovell had got the sums wrong then it is likely that he and his fellow astronauts, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, would have perished in space.

If Commander Lovell had got the sums wrong then it is likely that he and his fellow astronauts, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, would have perished in space

The single sheet on which Commander Lovell's notes were written is actually page 30 of the Apollo 13 contingency checklist

On April 13, 1970, the Apollo 13 moon mission was aborted  200,000 miles from Earth when an oxygen tank exploded.

The explosion caused another tank to fail, seriously jeopardizing the three-man crew's ability to return home.

Astronaut Jack Swigert famously said 'Houston, we've had a problem here' after the explosion, according to a NASA history of the flight.

The crew was forced to move into the lunar landing module for the return flight. 

Lovell's calculations on the checklist were key in the survival of the three astronauts on board.

The world was said to have held its breath after Apollo 13 suffered an explosion on its way to the Moon in April 1970.

The blast left the spacecraft crippled, prompting the famous line 'Houston, we've had a problem' from Commander Lovell.

Despite facing great difficulties due to limited power, plummeting temperatures, shortage of water and rising carbon dioxide levels the crew returned safely to Earth four days later.

The single sheet on which Commander Lovell's notes were written is actually page 30 of the Apollo 13 contingency checklist.

He used the sheet to record critical spacecraft altitude procedures to allow the crew to accurately perform the hugely important 'mid-course correction burn number five'.

The burn was designed to fire the engine up enough to boost the spacecraft's speed another 860 feet per second.

This meant the crew would get back to Earth quicker which would greatly enhance their chances of survival.

The burn forms a key scene in Ron Howard's Oscar-winning Apollo 13 film, in which Commander Lovell tries to keep the Earth in the spacecraft's window while performing the manoeuvre.

As the crippled spacecraft's navigation equipment was not working correctly the commander used the Earth as a reference point.

If the craft had been pointing in the wrong direction at the time of the burn the crew would likely have been shot into space with no hope of correcting their course to return home.

The sheet, which contains Commander Lovell's hand-written notes, is being sold by Mr Haise, who is now 79-years-old and living in Florida.

Last year a new law was introduced in the USA that allowed Apollo-era astronauts to keep items from their missions.

Although they were told they could keep certain things by their managers, there was always uncertainty over the issue which made it difficult for them to sell items at auction.

Matthew Haley, specialist in space history at Bonhams, said: ‘The crew had to abort the mission to land on the Moon because of the explosion.

Apollo 13 eventually came back to Earth and landed in the South Pacific

‘They were using the lunar module as a lifeboat and all of the standard procedures went out of the window.

‘The crew were getting constant instructions from Mission Control. That is why they are covered in the annotations. It is very, very unusual to have so many annotations.

‘Anything flown on Apollo 13 is rare but something like this with the annotations from Jim Lovell and Fred Haise is rarer still.

‘It gives us an interesting insight into the atmosphere inside the spacecraft.’

The Apollo space program was responsible for putting the first man on the moon.

It was the Apollo 11 mission which saw astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon on July 20, 1969.

The Apollo programme was abandoned in 1972 due to budget cuts.

The note is being sold by Bonhams in New York on March 25.
