England's footballers were pictured looking downbeat during their first training session after being kicked out of the World Cup yesterday.

The team were practising ahead of their last match of the tournament against Costa Rica on Tuesday afternoon.

Daniel Sturridge, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard all wore worried frowns as they headed out for their penultimate practice session today.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Rooney had taken to Facebook to apologise of the dismal performances, admitting, 'It hasn't worked out'.

The Manchester United forward told his 21 million Facebook fans: ‘Going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn't worked out. Sorry to all the fans that travelled and at home that we haven't done better. Gutted.’

Rooney was backed by his Red Devils teammate and Dutch captain Robin Van Persie who said: ‘I don't think you can blame him for scoring one goal, working his socks off and missing three chances by inches.

‘He gave his all for his country, like he always does. He's a great player, a great goal scorer, so I don't think it's fair on him to criticise him that much.’

Striker Daniel Sturridge said that he felt ‘sick’ and ‘heartbroken’, while captain Gerrard added: ‘We maybe should have accepted that going for a point [against Uruguay] might have been the best option.’

The lack of morale does not bode well for
 Tuesday's game against surprise group leaders Costa Rica as England try
 to salvage a point from their disastrous Brazil campaign.

The only happy man was 
manager Roy Hodgson, perhaps after hearing he will be keeping his job 
until 2016

The only 
man smiling on the training 
ground was Roy Hodgson, after FA chairman Greg Dyke said that Hodgson 
would keep his job as England manager until at least 2016, when the team
 are due to play their next major tournament.

England
 have been drawn against Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and 
San Marino for the Euro 2016 qualifiers which begin in September.

Dyke said Hodgson remained the right man for the task, telling Sky Sports News: ‘He came to do a four-year cycle.

‘People have been asking the question: "Will he stay?" Well, the answer is yes.’

Costa
 Rica, who are ranked 28th in the world, were written off before the 
tournament but have so far shocked fans and foes alike to beat both 
Italy, ranked ninth, and Uruguay, ranked seventh.

Their
 1-0 victory over the Italians yesterday sent England crashing out of 
this year's tournament before the end of the group stage, a low not 
experienced since 1958.

And now the Costa Ricans will be looking for at least a draw on Tuesday to guarantee that they will leave the Group D 
in first place, meaning they will play the runners-up in Group C in the 
last 16.

England, 
meanwhile, having nothing except pride to play for as they sit bottom of the group without a single point having lost both of their opening games
 2-1.

Italy struck first in the opening game in Manaus a fortnight ago, with Claudio Marchisio finding the target on 35 minutes.

Rooney combined with Sturridge two minutes later to produce a goal that saw England back into the game, but a Mario Balotelli goal shortly after the start of the second half saw England capitulate.

Wayne Rooney may have scored his first World Cup goal on Thursday against Uruguay, but two strikes and two goals from Luis Suarez either side of that meant England's campaign was all but over.

Perhaps the only consolation is that Spain, reigning world and European champions, fared just as badly as England, crashing out after being thrashed 5-1 by the Netherlands and 2-0 by Chile.

England's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay on Saturday marks the first time that the team have lost their opening two fixtures of the World Cup since 1958
