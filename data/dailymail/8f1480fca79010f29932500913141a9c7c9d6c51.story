An international consortium of scientists has published a high resolution draft of the barley genome in a move that may hold the key to better beer.

Barley is the second most important crop in UK agriculture and malting barley underpins brewing and pub industries worth some £20billion to the UK economy.

The breakthrough is a critical step towards barley varieties able to fight against cereal crop diseases and cope with the demands of climate change, researchers claim.

Better beers on the way? Scientists have mapped the genome of barley, a key ingredient in beer

'This research will streamline efforts to improve barley production through breeding for improved varieties,' said Professor Robbie Waugh, of Scotland's James Hutton Institute, who led the research.

'This could be varieties better able to withstand pests and disease, deal with adverse environmental conditions, or even provide grain better suited for beer and brewing.'

World's fourth most important cereal: Barley, a close relative of wheat and rye, was first cultivated 15,000 years ago and is vital to agriculture today

Barley which has been malted is a key ingredient in brewing beer along with hops and yeast.

The research, published in the journal
 Nature, could also be a boon for the whisky industry while barley is 
also a major component of animal feed for meat and dairy industries.

Barley is the world's fourth most important cereal crop, behind maize, rice and wheat.

First cultivated more than 15,000 years ago, it belongs to the same family as wheat and rye. Together, they provide about 30 per cent of all calories consumed worldwide.

Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage and the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea.

Thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage, beer is produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar.

The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat. Unmalted maize and rice are widely used adjuncts to lighten the flavour because of their lower cost. The preparation of beer is called brewing.  Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative.

Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours; and The Hymn to Ninkasi, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served also as a method of remembering the recipe for beer.

With a genome almost twice the size of
 that of humans, determining the sequence of barley DNA was a major 
challenge, researchers said.

They said the crop plant's genome 
contains a large proportion of closely related sequences that are 
difficult to piece together in a true linear order.

However by applying various strategies to circumvent these difficulties Professor Waugh and his team were able to put together a high resolution draft with most of the 32,000 barley genes in linear order.

Their research reveals the functional proportions of the barley genome, giving a detailed analysis of where and when genes are switched on in different tissues at different stages of development.

This, they hope, will offer researchers a far better understanding of the crop's immune system.

'It will accelerate research in barley, and its close relative, wheat,' Professor Waugh said.

'Armed with this information breeders and scientists will be much better placed to deal with the challenge of effectively addressing the food security agenda under the constraints of a rapidly changing environment.'
