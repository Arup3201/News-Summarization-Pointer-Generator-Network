There can be no doubt that voluminous beards are well and truly back in fashion.

And while every other hipster seems to be sporting a forest of facial hair, few can compete with these incredibly artistic beards coming from New Zealand.

The pictures are part of advertising campaign by a razor brand and seem at first glance to merely to show men with an impressive chin beehive.

However further inspection reveals their beards to in fact be curled up creatures, complete with unbelievably realistic little faces.

Either curled round the jawline, or clinging to the rather stoic looking men's chins, the animals have been carefully created from their own facial hair.Â 

Attempting to convince hipsters to prevent their beloved beards from going feral, razor brand Schick have also launched a competition.

Bearded men can post pictures on social media uder the tag #FreeYourSkin with the chance to can win cash or beard-taming tools.

A recent 
study revealed women found the same man more attractive with a 10-day 
beard than clean-shaven, so perhaps a little beard is OK as long as it's
 maintained and kept form going haywire.

While this may be an amusing and attention grabbing concept for an advert, we dread to think of scores of Bohemians taking a razor to their beard in an attempt to imitate this ultimate 'alternative' facial hair style.
