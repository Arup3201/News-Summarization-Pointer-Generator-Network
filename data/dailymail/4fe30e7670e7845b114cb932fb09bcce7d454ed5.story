You might think it tricky to get any more make-up on to Kim Kardashian's face. But you'd be wrong.

A Newcastle-based make-up artist has now created a likeness of the future Mrs Kanye West using only lipstick, blusher and eye liner.

Beautician and mother-of-four Maxine Ayre, 34, has turned painter, creating realistic artworks of celebrities including Kim, Beyonce and Cheryl Cole using only cosmetics.

Maxine Ayre paints the unmistakable images using a range of luxury, professional make-up products to replicate the longed-for beauty looks worn by Naomi Campbell, Beyonce and Cheryl Cole.

The finished portrait of Kim Kardashian perfectly captures her signature make-up look, as well as being a stunning portrait of the reality star

Maxine has only 
been doing the 'make-up art' for three months, but has already been 
inundated with requests from people who want her to emulate their favourite famous
 icons.

She specialises in using everyday products to capture the pristine celebrity look on canvas - using everything from eye liner and blusher to lip gloss and eye shadow.

Maxine said: 'I've been really surprised at the response I get from people on social networks every time I post a picture.

'I have received some lovely comments from some amazing and very talented people who are well recognised in the make-up world. And I am slowly building up followers on Instagram and Twitter.

'I have even received a number of requests from fans of my work, asking me to draw them in make-up.'

Maxine uses all the tricks of the trade to create her artwork, which she draws onto canvas, replicating the looks often seen on popular celebrities such as Cheryl Cole

Mother-of-four Maxine has 16 years of
 experience working in the beauty industry and now runs her own 
freelance hair and make-up company, Maximillion Hair and Make-up.

The
 inspiration for the portraits came after Maxine watched Naomi Campbell 
on TV show The Face, and thought what an amazing job it would be to do 
the hair and make-up for the top supermodels.

The
 young mother purchased pro-charts - a specialist book of paper that is 
used to map out make-up ideas for photo shoots - and started to 
experiment using different kinds of make-up to match the looks made 
famous by some of the most well-recognised female celebrities.

Maxine's work - which includes portraits of singers such as Beyonce, pictured - has seen her gain popularity on social media

This portrait of Naomi Campbell is incredibly realistic, despite being painted entirely using everyday make-up items

Maxine posts all of her work on her 
Twitter and Instagram pages, and has painted famous faces such as 
Beyonce, Naomi Campbell, Kim Kardashian and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

And each one of her pictures is made using enough cosmetic products to do the full make-up for around five brides.

Maxine added: 'I find the whole process quite therapeutic, it helps me to relax when the children are in bed.

'But I can be up until the early hours as the hours just seem to fly by.'

She added: 'It
 takes about two days in total to create one of the images, as I always 
like to leave it for a day and come back to it with fresh eyes.

'Then
 I just pick up where I left off, as and when I have the time; but with 
four kids, a boyfriend and a full time business to run this is now 
becoming my "me time".

'I
 definitely think these charts look better in person as it is quite hard
 to capture them in photo, as any change in lighting or angle and it 
changes the look completely.

'It
 has also become a bit of a running joke between my friends and family 
that if anyone asks if I've ever done a celebrity's makeup, I can say, 
"yes, I've done Cheryl Cole's".'

Each portrait, such as this one of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, uses enough cosmetic products to do the make-up for around five brides

Each picture starts with a basic sketch of a celebrity's face, in this case Cheryl Cole, which Maxine then builds on
