Sixteen-time world champion Phil Taylor will face Gary Anderson in the World Darts Championship final after he saw off Raymond van Barneveld 6-2 in the second semi-final.

Taylor let a 2-0 lead slip as the Dutchman won the third set 3-0 and then punished a Taylor miss to level it up, but from then on "The Power" looked in imperious form as he won four sets in a row to reach his 20th world final.

'It was a bit of walk in the first two sets and then he came back and it was nip and tuck,' Taylor said. 'I thought to myself, "You're in the semi-final, come on" and I pushed on a bit. That's all I did.

'When we walked in, Gary said, "I'll see you tomorrow in the final". Barney's missus was behind him and she wasn't very happy but he didn't mean it like that.

'It will be a great final tomorrow.' 

Taylor will now be aiming to win a 17th title at the Alexandra Palace on Sunday against Gary Anderson
