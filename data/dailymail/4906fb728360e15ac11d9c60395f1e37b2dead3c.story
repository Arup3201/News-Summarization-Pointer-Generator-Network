Manchester United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits.

Here, Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old Trafford.

They are two giants of Dutch football. Johan Cruyff, arguably the country’s greatest player, and Louis van Gaal, one of the greatest managers of the modern era. And they have a feud which has festered throughout four decades.

Some believe that proud Van Gaal resented the adulation heaped on playing legend Cruyff, the man who had the place at the heart of the Ajax team that an ambitious reserve wanted for his own.

Others think Cruyff felt he was owed 
more respect by a young player who couldn’t match his own stellar 
achievements. It might even have been as simple as Cruyff once put it: 
‘We have a bad chemistry.’

Whatever the precise beginnings, the feud is bitter. It is long-standing, apparently irreparable and riddled with curious altercations.

In 1989, for example, Cruyff hosted a Christmas dinner. Van Gaal was among the guests and enjoyed the night. Until the phone went. For Louis. It was his family, with the news that his sister had died. 

Van Gaal hastily left to be with his family. According to Van Gaal, Cruyff blamed him for not having had the character to thank him properly for the Christmas dinner before leaving. Cruyff denied this: ‘Nonsense. If Van Gaal actually said this, he has Alzheimer’s. Seriously, if someone thinks that of me, he lost the plot - he probably lost the whole trilogy.’ 

The battle began when the pair first met as players at Ajax. Louis was the young boy in the second team whose path to the top was blocked by the legend playing in the same position. Both are vocal, dominant and cocky. You need to be when you play at Ajax, especially when you want to be a playmaker.

Cruyff was the pivot at Ajax, and Van Gaal, four years his junior, was biding his time to replace the  master. He impressed in the youth system with his skills and vision but was too slow to succeed at the top.

Their paths crossed time and again. Cruyff excelled as Ajax coach before Van Gaal took the job and spent his first few months in charge hearing calls for the great man to return. Van Gaal, a surprise appointment to many, was struggling to impose his ideas and had to listen to the name of his rival being chanted from the stands.

By the time he was winning multiple titles and the Champions League, Cruyff was having equal success in charge of Barcelona but neither could muster the courage to congratulate the other.

On the contrary, when Cruyff was asked in the mid-1990s which clubs other than Barcelona played good football, he didn’t mention Ajax - instead referring to Parma and Auxerre, teams that ousted Ajax from the European tournaments in earlier seasons. 

The intriguing similarities in their careers continued when the Cruyff reign at Barcelona ended and, after Bobby Robson’s one season, Van Gaal took over.

Cruyff had been Barcelona’s longest-serving coach. With 11 trophies, he was also the club’s most successful. But he never forgave Van Gaal for taking the job he felt should be his. Around 2000, when Frank Rijkaard, a Cruyff disciple, was head coach of the Dutch national team, Cruyff presented a development plan to the Dutch FA.

When the federation picked Van Gaal as Rijkaard’s successor, he wiped Cruyff’s plan off the table and presented his own, prescribing in fine detail how Dutch coaching should operate.

The feud 
hit its peak in 2011 when Van Gaal was invited to return to Ajax as 
general director, at a time when Cruyff, as club commissioner, had seen 
his recommendation of winger Tscheu La Ling rejected. The other board 
members, knowing that Cruyff would not agree to Van Gaal’s return, 
organised a meeting while he was in Barcelona tocelebrate his daughter 
Chantal’s birthday.

Cruyff
 made sly digs and refused to work with the notebook-wielding Van Gaal. 
Cruyff said: ‘Van Gaal has a good vision of football but it is not mine.
 He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working 
with his tactics. I don’t. I want individuals to think for themselves.’

And Cruyff was just as critical of Van Gaal’s plans for the youth  education system. ‘You  judge football players intuitively and with your heart,’ he said. ‘On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax I would have failed the test. 

‘When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.’

After the appointment of Van Gaal as technical director, Cruyff filed a lawsuit. The court ruled against him but legal action went on and,  ultimately, he got his way - Van Gaal’s return never happened.The two men are still not on speaking terms. Amsterdam is not big enough for the both of them.
