Cesc Fabregas and Angel di Maria are rightfully lauded as two of the most creative players in the Premier League, but the foreign imports don't top the minutes per chance created charts.

Perhaps surprisingly, Manchester City's James Milner tops the list for chances created per minutes on the pitch of the Premier League players who have clocked up a minimum of 450 minutes so far this season.

The England winger has laid on 27 chances for team-mates in his 640 minutes, giving him an impressive minutes per chance ratio of 23.7.

Three players from Manuel Pellegrini's side feature in the top five as Spaniard Jesus Navas is in second with 30 chances created in 805 minutes while Samir Nasri earns a ratio of 27.1 for his 597 minutes on the pitch.

The star-studded list also included Manchester United summer signing Angel di Maria, who has made a bright start to his career at Old Trafford, scoring three goals while creating 31 opportunities.

Fabregas, who sits in fifth place, looks on course to break Thierry Henry's Premier League assist record of 20 in a season as the Spaniard has already set up 10 goals to help Chelsea to the Premier League's summit.

As Sportsmail's table shows, the former Arsenal man has created an astonishing 45 chances for his team-mates so far this season, but has barely missed a kick for Chelsea having been on the pitch for 1,237 minutes which means he has created a chance every 27.5 minutes.

Arsenal's main man Alexis Sanchez has made a sensational start to the season, scoring nine Premier League goals, but he can only prop up the minutes per chances table as the forward finds himself in 10th place. 

Sanchez has created 34 chances for Danny Welbeck and Co during his 1,051 minutes on the pitch which puts him behind QPR's Bobby Zamora and West Ham's Stewart Downing.

Downing's 2014-15 form has seen the winger reclaim a place in Roy Hodgson's England squad and Hammers boss Sam Allardyce will hope Downing can continue his ratio of 29.2 minutes per chances created with Andy Carroll looking to find form up front. 

QPR fans will be pleased to see two of their players in the list with Zamora in sixth and combative midfielder Joey Barton in ninth place having created 20 chances for his colleagues.
