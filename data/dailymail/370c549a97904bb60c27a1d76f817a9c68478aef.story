A schoolboy dubbed 'the Titch-hiker' after he hitched a lift home from school by riding on the tailbar of a 40-tonne lorry has been named, shamed and turned over to police - by his own parents.

Sonny Wilson, 12, said he 'scared himself' when he jumped on the back of the truck and clung on as the 
driver then set off unaware of his stowaway passenger.

Sonny, from Blackburn, Lancashire, said he didn't expect the vehicle to drive off when he climbed on.

The prankster said he tried to jump off when fear set in but the lorry had picked up speed.

'I couldn't get off because it was going so fast,' he said.

Today he faced a police grilling after his father David Wilson and mother Karen Brian, both 48, saw the footage on Facebook and called the police.

Disappointed: Father David Gordon was horrified by the video clip. He didn't finish watching it, but called the police instead

Dangerous: Sonny Wilson rides on the tailbar of the lorry in a terrifying stunt which was filmed and posted on Facebook

Terrifying: Sonny Wilson didn't expect the lorry to drive off when he jumped on the back

Mr Gordon said: 'When I saw the footage I 
thought it was a practical joke. I didn't even let it go all the way 
through before I was on the phone to the police.'

Mrs Brian said she didn't realise the boy in the video was her son.

The mother-of-six said: 'Somebody tagged me
into the video on Facebook and as I was watching it I thought what a 
stupid thing to do.

'It wasn't until a friend of mine asked if it was Sonny that I put two and two together.

'In that moment I just felt sick to my stomach.

'I made the difficult decision to report it to the police as I just can't stop thinking about what could have happened.

'I want them to take him to the police station and instill the fear of god in him.'

Sonny said it was not the first time he had 'lorry surfed' but he is remorseful after his antics turned dangerous.

'I thought it was a laugh and a prank. I just wasn't thinking about the consequences.

Named and shamed: Sonny Wilson, 12, was reported to the police by his worried parents. They say they wanted to 'put the fear of God' in him

Danger: As the vehicle climbs uphill on the main road through Blackburn, the boy continues to cling to the back

The youngster, who wore his school uniform during the prank, has been suspended by Our Lady and St John's School for two days.

He said: 'I had no idea school would 
suspend me, but they said it was because I was representing the school 
in my uniform when it happened.

'I did try and contact the people who filmed and posted the video on Facebook and asked them to take it down but they didn't.'

Sonny- who nonchalantly gave the thumbs up after 
leaping off the back of the truck - was condemned by road safety 
officials for the prank which was caught on camera.

Footage of the incident was captured by a
front seat passenger in a car travelling behind and the 52-second clip was posted on Facebook.

The lorry driver negotiated a major road junction before travelling up hill along a busy road for around half a mile as the boy sat on the tailgate seemingly admiring the view.

Eventually
when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy 
jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind a cheeky thumbs up 
before walking off down the street.

The
road which has small shops and terrace houses is one of Blackburn's 
busiest approaches, leading towards the M65 and towns including 
Accrington and Burnley.

Risk: The lorry makes its way past parked cars with other vehicles and a bus passing in the opposite direction

Horror: A bus passes in the opposite direction, left, and the boy then shortly afterwards jumps off, right

Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: 'This is a dangerous and foolish act which could easily result in serious injury or death.

'We urge teenagers not to give into peer pressure or to encourage others to copy this behaviour.'

The group who filmed the video can be heard shouting: 'What's he doing the crazy little f*****?'

They then add: 'Are you filming it? He must be s****** himself. Look at him. What the f*** is he doing?'

The lorry passes a bus, as well as rows of parked cars as he travels at up to 30mph on the street.

The
clip with the title 'Only in Blackburn ya find a little kid like this 
couldn't believe it funny as f***' has now been shared thousands of 
times on the social media website.

Suzanne Sourbutts said: 'Silly boy, if that wagon had to brake suddenly God knows what might have happened.'

Pauline Emmerson added: 'What if he'd fallen, not so funny if he'd landed underneath a car.'

Andrew Tony posted a message saying: 'Saved himself 40p bus fare there..... Bit crazy tho...'

Calm: The boy wanders off after jumping off the lorry as if nothing untoward had happened

He added: 'I also hope other young people across Blackburn are not thinking of doing anything so stupid.'

A police spokesman said: "I can confirm we have received calls from the parents of the young boy involved in the lorry surfing footage.

"Their details have been passed to the neighbourhood policing who will be dealing with it from there."

A TNT Express spokesman said: 'TNT 
Express is aware of video footage on social media channels which shows a
young schoolboy riding on the rear bumper of one of its vehicles.

'TNT does not condone such dangerous and illegal behaviour which could lead to serious injury or worse.

'We take such matters very seriously and are doing everything possible to help police with their investigations.'
