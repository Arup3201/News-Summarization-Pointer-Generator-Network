A gunman in China has killed himself after executing one of his neighbours and firing at armed police in a 12-hour standoff.

Li Tak-yan, 51, who had served time in jail for attacking another neighbour with a knife, shot Liu Kai-chung, 43, dead outside his apartment in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong, on Saturday night in an apparently unmotivated attack.

Li then shot at armed police, sparking a 12-hour 
standoff which only ended after officers from the elite Special Duties 
Unit, known as the Flying Tigers, stormed the apartment and found him 
dead.

In dramatic twist it has emerged that Li is the father of Chinese actress and model Liddy Li, 27, who has made headlines recently after her affair with married director Oxide Pang was exposed.

Li Tak-yan, 51, father of Chinese model Liddy Li, executed one of his neighbours in Hong Kong, starting a 12-hour standoff with armed police which ended with him killing himself

During the stalemate, Li fired appeared on the window ledge outside his apartment with a gun to his head before firing shots at armed police officers below

Police fired one shot at Li, forcing him inside. Elite officers from the Special Duties Unit, known as the Flying Tigers, then stormed the apartment but found Li had killed himself

Police are investigating whether Li's murder and subsequent suicide had anything to do Liddy and Pang's relationship, which was exposed when they were secretly photographed on a date.

After the photo was leaked, Pang flew to the Malaysia to win back his wife, actress Lee Sinje, and then made a joint statement apologising to his wife and admitting his errors.

The standoff with Li began at 11pm on Saturday night after he followed neighbour Liu into the lift in their apartment building on the Kai Ching estate, going with him up to the 21st floor.

As Liu 
approached his front door, keys in hand, Li shot him three times 
'execution style' before returning to his own apartment 11 floors below.

Police
 evacuated that floor overnight, and in the morning Li appeared on the 
window ledge outside his apartment with a gun pointed at his head before
 shooting at police below.

In a dramatic twist it has emerged that Li's daughter is model and actress Liddy Li, who has been making headlines after her affair with married director Oxide Pang was exposed

After Oxide (left) and Li were pictured together kissing and hugging on a day out, Oxide left Li to return to Malaysia and win back his wife and has since apologised for his actions

Police are now investigating whether Li's murder and suicide had anything to do with Liddy's affair

Officers 
returned one shot, forcing Li back inside. The Flying Tigers then 
abseiled down the outside of the building, throwing stun grenades 
through the windows before storming the apartment.

When they got inside they found Li's body slumped next to two pistols, one of which was handmade and 43 rounds of ammunition.

Police have since removed three knives, three holsters and a computer from the flat.

Hong Kong police are working closely with their Guangdong counterparts to trace the source of the weapons.

The Standard in Hong Kong is reporting that Liddy accompanied her younger sister and mother 
Ding Ping to Fu Shan Public Mortuary in Sha Tin to identify the body of 
the gunman

Divorced and unemployed, Li had a well-earned reputation for aggressiveness against his neighbours.

Speaking to the South China Morning Post, a resident of Li's tower block who gave his name only as Wong, said: 'He's not the kind of neighbour who you can have a casual chat with.

'About half a year ago, he banged on everyone's door [on my floor] to complain about a noise problem and no one dared to open their doors.'

Before attacking officers, Li executed neighbour Liu Kai-chung, 43, by following him up to his apartment and shooting him three times outside his front door

Another resident Tsang Yuk said that when she took her son to the courtyard downstairs she always saw Li wearing the same red polo shirt.

'His shirt stank so bad as if he never washed it,' she said, adding that he acted rather strangely and liked to sit in different corners of the playground.

In a temporary housing estate in the town of Yuen Long where he lived 
after his business failed and his wife left him, Li attacked and injured
 a man next door with a meat cleaver

According to The Standard, during the court case Liddy wrote to the judge describing Li as a 'good father'.

He received a one-year prison sentence for his crime, and upon his release moved into the tower near the old Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong.

Psychologists said at the time that he had poor anger management abilities and dealt poorly with stress, but despite being lonely and volatile he was not mentally ill.

Neighbours said Li was hot-tempered and once banged on everyone's door to complain about noise (pictured, Li's body is taken out of the apartment)

Li had a history of attacking his neighbours - he was jailed for a year in 2011 for slicing one with a meat cleaver after his wife left him and his business collapsed
