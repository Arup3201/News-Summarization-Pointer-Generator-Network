A jewellery maker has been become Britain's Queen of Bling after she rose from obscurity to design the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite earrings.

Catherine Zoraida, 32, set up her small, self-titled firm just four years ago and was virtually unknown until the 33-year-old royal asked to see some pieces.

Kate, 33, went on to wear a pair of the designer's stunning 'double leaf' earrings and an intricate 'Spread Your Wings' bracelet, £420, while meeting the King of Malaysia during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee tour in 2012.

She wore the simple pieces with a stunning gold and white custom-made Alexander McQueen gown. 

Catherine, who trained at Edinburgh College of Art, said that the Duchess had come across her work and requested some pieces to look at.

She bought seven pieces including the earrings and the bracelet.

The 18 carat gold plated bracelet is made of an intricately linked leaf design and measures 17cm in length and the designer notes it will add drama to any outfit. 

She said: 'It was just before the Queen's Diamond Jubilee tour and amazingly she ended up wearing some of these pieces.

'She wore the earrings and a bracelet to dinner with the King of Malaysia.

'Suddenly people were trying to guess this new jewellery designer and when they found out it was me they just went crazy.' 

The Scottish and Colombian jeweller soon became inundated with orders after Kate continued to wear the designer's earrings and  to countless special occasions.

The Duchess wore the delicate leaf earrings made from 18 carat gold-plated silver over two Christmases - most recently on a trip to church at Sandringham in December.

She also teamed them with Alice Temperley during a trip to the South Pacific in 2012 and at Uluru with Prince William earlier this year she wore the subtle pieces with a Roksanda Ilincic shift.

Engraved with a feather detail, they are 6cm in size and are described on the jeweller's website as 'timeless gold earrings are an everyday classic'. 

Her jewellery is designed and made in Britain. 

The earrings even made an appearance on a trip to the South Pacific with Prince William in 2012
