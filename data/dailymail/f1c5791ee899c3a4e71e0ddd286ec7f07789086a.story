Han Bingbing, an 11-year-old girl from China, has successfully had a 33 pound tumour removed from her abdomen.

The girl, from Heilongjiang in the north-east of the country, underwent eight hours of surgery to remove an intraperitoneal tumor.

After four years, the tumor had grown to the size of two footballs. As of June 18th, the tumor filled five-sixths of Bingbing's abdomen and was causing her internal organs to gradually collapse.

Steady hands: Doctors cut away at the huge ovarian teratoma in her stomach

The Xukecheng Health Care Corporation raised Â£11,000 that went towards Bingbing's surgery.

The brave schoolgirl was first diagnosed with ovarian teratoma in 2009. Since then, her family have run up considerable debts trying to fund their daughter's medical bills for her ongoing treatment.

The youngster has suffered with the condition for the past five years, defying the expectations of many doctors.

Several clinics refused to treat Ms Bingbing until her family found a hospital, 2,500 miles away in Guangzhou, southern China.

The surgery took eight hours. Many hospitals refused to perform the procedure
