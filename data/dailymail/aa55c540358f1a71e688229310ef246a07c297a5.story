Fitbit devices have once again come under fire for causing painful skin rashes.

The California-based company admits that a 'limited percentage' of users have reported skin irritation from constantly wearing the fitness tracker.

It is now advising people to take a break from wearing the device - despite the gadget being designed for constant use.

Fitbits are meant to be worn, in order to track your steps, sleep and other health metrics

'According to our consulting dermatologists, [the rashes] are likely from wearing the band too tight,' Fitbit said in a statement to Dailymail.com.

It said other causes could be 'sweat, water, or soap being held against the skin under the device; or from pressure or friction against the skin.'

'They should resolve quickly when users take a break from the device, usually within hours or days. If symptoms persist, contact your doctor.'

The Fitbit Surge - which costs $250 - was launched four months ago. Other bands affected include the Charge and Charge HR which cost $130 and $150. 

'According to our consulting dermatologists, [the rashes] are likely from wearing the band too tight,' Fitbit said in a statement to Dailymail.com. Pictured is a rash from its Force wristband, which has also caused problems

Last year, the company voluntarily recalled its Force wristband after nearly two per cent of users said they suffered skin irritations

ABC7 news in San Francisco has reported that it had found more than 200 instances of new Fitbit rash complaints on social media.

Shaun Ewing posted a picture of his rash on Twitter with the message: 'Having a break from my @fitbit Surge. Might need to stop wearing it - nice rash (and my skin isn't usually sensitive).'

Another user, Laura Evans wrote 'I love my new @fitbit minus the awesome, itchy rash that comes with it. Ugh.'

This isn't the first time Fitbit users have reported skin rashes.

Last year, the company voluntarily recalled its Force wristband after nearly two per cent of users said they suffered skin irritations.

'The reactions we are seeing with new products are different from the allergic reactions we saw with Force, and are not uncommon with jewellery or wearable devices that stay in contact with the skin for extended periods,' Fitbit told DailyMail.com.

'The reactions we are seeing with new products are different from the allergic reactions we saw with Force, and are not uncommon with jewellery or wearable devices that stay in contact with the skin for extended periods,' Fitbit told DailyMail.com

Force's housing and band were held together with adhesive, which was determined to be the cause of nearly all allergic reactions.

The company's newest products - the Charge, the Charge HR and the Surge - are held together with screws.

'We also significantly reduced the amount of surgical-grade stainless steel,' a spokesperson for Fitbit said.

'We have conducted extensive testing with laboratories and consulted with top dermatologists to develop stringent standards.'

Fitness bands could be as much as 40 per cent off the mark when it comes to counting the number of calories burned, according to a recent study

The follows the results of a study which suggests wearables may not be as accurate as you think.

Researchers tested some of the most popular models, with participants taking part in a number of activities while wearing seven different bands.

The results showed the bands could be as much as 40 per cent off the mark when it comes to counting the number of calories burned by the wearer.

More than 70 million 'smart' wrist bands, chest straps, ankle trackers and sports watches were sold worldwide last year. And the number is only expected to increase.

That is why it is important to determine how accurate the monitors are assessing the energy burned by the wearer, Yang Bai, the lead researcher on the Iowa State University study said.

He asked more than 50 healthy participants, aged between 18 and 65, to choose three different activities of varying intensity.

Each performed 20 minutes of sedentary activity - such as reading, watching TV, typing - 25 minutes of aerobic exercise on a treadmill, and 25 minutes of resistance exercise, with five minutes of rest between each activity.

They wore Fitbit Flex, Polar Loop, Misfit Shine, Nike+Fuelband SE, Jawbone UP on the wrist, Actigraph GT3X+ on the waist, and BodyMedia Core on the left arm.

At the same time they were being monitored with the Oxycon Mobile, a portable system that measures calories burnt by analysing oxygen levels in exhaled breath.

Results showed the BodyMedia Core was the most accurate device, with the Fitbit Flex coming in second place. This supported a previous study which rated them as the two most accurate.
