A driver who accidentally drove his semi-truck across a footbridge before getting stuck attempting to cross another has claimed he was simply following the GPS.

The unidentified driver, from Louisiana, caused some damage - and a fair few laughs - when he drove the vehicle onto a walkway in Milwaukee's historic Lake Park on Tuesday afternoon.

He managed to steer the truck over one narrow footbridge in the park, living up to the motto emblazoned on the side of his truck: 'We drive a fine line.'

Oops: A semi truck became stuck trying to cross a footbridge in Milwaukee's Lake Park on Tuesday

Nice try: The semi managed to cross one footbridge, seen bottom left, before getting stuck on the second

Astonishingly, the bridge held the weight of the semi, which was empty, but a historian told WISN that it could have caused the path to collapse if the vehicle had been full of bricks.

The 50-year-old driver, who works for Kentucky-based Paschall Truck Lines, was taken to hospital as a precaution after the truck came to a stop on Tuesday.

In his path, he damaged several trees and concrete railings. 

He has been fined $579.80 for reckless driving and failure to obey signs, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office said on Wednesday.

Ray's Towing Co. managed to remove the truck over three hours on Wednesday. 

Fitting: Along the side of the truck, owned by a Kentucky company, read: 'We drive a fine line'

Damage: The driver caused damage to the side of the bridge, as well as several trees in the park

Mark Salentine, from the company, told the Journal-Sentinel that the job took 'more finesse than force - and some patience'.

'This certainly was a challenge - a creative challenge,' he told the publication.

The two bridges were inspected by a structural engineer, who deemed them safe for people to use.
