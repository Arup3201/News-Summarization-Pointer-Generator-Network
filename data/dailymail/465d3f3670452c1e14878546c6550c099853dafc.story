Paul Gascoigne's step-daughter Bianca hit back today after trolls suggested she should have done more to help her step-father.

Former England player Gascoigne is in hospital after he was led away from his home in Sandbanks, Dorset by police and an ambulance crew yesterday following worried neighbours' calls to emergency services.

Step-daughter Bianca, 27, was seen at a premiere of the film Sin City 2 on Wednesday, the day before her step-father was seen clutching a
 bottle of gin as he staggered 
around outside his home.

As the sad news about her step-father emerged this morning, vile trolls took to Twitter to mock the ex-footballer and blame glamour model Bianca.

Bianca Gascoigne was attacked by Twitter trolls today after she was spotted at a film premiere the day before her ex-footballer step-father, Paul, was hospitalised after a drinking session at his home in Dorset

Paul Gascoigne was pictured clutching a bottle of gin yesterday amid fears he has lapsed back into alcoholism

Twitter trolls accused the former footballer's step-daughter of not being there for her step-father

But she hit back, accusing the trolls of not knowing what they are talking about

One webuser wrote: 'At a premier (sic) yet 4 hrs later thanking Paul's well wishes. Here's a thought, be with him 4hr earlier'

Another asked: 'Why aren't you there for him now he clearly needs you?'

One online bullying told the glamour model her step-father was 'done' and another branded Bianca 'attention seeking'.

Bianca hit back this afternoon, tweeting: 'There are some sick twisted 
people out there have some compassion don't know why people feel the 
need to be so nasty & have opinions they know nothing about.'

Her response came as it emerged Gascoigne could be forced out of the £3million rented home he has been living in on the south coast.

The director of the management company in
 charge of the flats where Gascoigne has been living today dismissed 
claims he is being evicted, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave.

'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.'

The former England footballer was seen with his head in his hands outside his home in Sandbanks, Dorset

After being spotted with cans of beer, he was escorted away by police and an ambulance crew

The news came after shocking
 pictures emerged showing the former player - once the country's most gifted 
midfielder - slumped, head in hands, outside his penthouse apartment.

Gascoigne was
 taken from the flat by medics and driven to Poole 
Hospital yesterday afternoon and he remained there this morning.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also 
lives in Sandbanks, today offered Gascoigne the chance to work alongside 
him in football.

He
 said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said "I'll pick you up in the 
mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the 
kids". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation.

'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.'

In a TV documentary shown last 
September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start 
drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him.

The former footballer looked much older than his 47 years as walked around with a bottle of spirits

Dressed in a pair of slippers and holding a bag full of cans of lager, the  star looked a shadow of his former self

It is believed worried neighbours called emergency services after the 47-year-old was seen drinking

Gascoigne is believed to have been taken to hospital for his own safety after he was again seen drinking

Gascoigne spoke of his addiction and a previous relapse earlier this year in the
 ITV show Being Paul Gascoigne.

He said: 'I just 
remember one bit after the third day of being in hospital when he (the 
doctor) said "I don't think this guy is going to make it" and I sort of 
put my head up a little bit and I was like, tubes in my arms and an 
oxygen tank injecting round my heart and lungs and that.'

He added: 'I just come forward and I 
went "I don't want to die, I need to water the plants" and that was it 
and then I woke up two weeks later.

'With
 me now, if I did have a drink and relapse, it's like becoming tipsy and
 merry is OK for a couple of days but like the next mouthful I'm so 
down, I'm so depressed, I cry.

'I
 do all that because I know inside I'm hurting myself again. I know 
where I'm heading - a wooden box. Or I'm back in treatment or hospital. 
Or getting sectioned.'

Gascoigne has long battled drinking problems and went to a rehab centre in the US last year to save himself

He was taken to nearby Poole Hospital for his own safety after worried neighbours raised the alarm

It had been claimed that Gascoigne
 was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes 
led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who 
convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward 
Sunday League side.

The 
47-year-old enjoyed a memorable professional career which saw him play for the likes of Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Rangers, whilst 
also becoming a firm favourite among many England supporters.

Gascoigne, who has been plagued by 
alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football trn years ago when he made five appearances for then-League Two side Boston
 United.

Daren Hills, secretary of the Bournemouth Football Association, confirmed that his registration has been received.

A spokesman for Gascoigne decline to comment on the incident outside his home.

Gascoigne's former teammates rallied around today as the star remained in Poole Hospital.

Chris Waddle, who played in the 1990 World Cup where Gascoigne made his name, took to twitter to offer his support.

He tweeted: 'I know it's hard to stay focused but you have so many people who want you to come through this come on stay strong'

Above a picture of the pair playing together for England, he then added: 'Love you mate'

Another of Gascoigne's Italia '90 teammates, Match of the Day Presenter Gary Lineker, also offered a serious message for the troubled star.

In comments reported in the Daily Record, he said: 'Ultimately the support has got to come from Gazza himself.

'We've supported him over years, Tottenham and his friends. I wish him well but ultimately it's got to come from Paul.'

Gascoigne was accused of being 'under the influence of alcohol' while manager of Kettering in 2005

1998 -The full extent of Gascoigne's drinking problems became clear when he was still playing. He was checked into the Priory rehab clinic in 1998 by his then-manager at Middlesborough, Bryan Robson.

The treatment followed a year of trauma during which he was dropped from England's World Cup squad, divorced from wife Sheryl and faced the death from alcoholic poisoning of close friend, David Cheek, after they had spent a night out together.

He was released, at his own insistence, two weeks into the suggested minimum stay of 28 days.

2001 - After joining Everton he missed a friendly with Tranmere during Everton's pre-season build-up. It later emerged he was attending a rehabilitation clinic in Arizona, USA, where he was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.

2004 - After a spell with a Chinese B-league side, Gascoigne returned to Britain but was involved in a car accident when he drove his four-wheel drive BMW into a parked truck.

He escaped without serious injury and later joined Boston United as player-coach, before leaving after just two matches. In a bizarre episode, he then announced he wanted to change his name to G8.

2005 -  The former England football star was hospitalised with pneumonia. He was later appointed manager of non-league Kettering, but left the club after 39 days following claims by the club's chairman that he was 'under the influence of alcohol before, during and after several first-team games and training sessions'.

Gascoigne denied the claims, insisting: 'I had a double brandy before one of the games, but it used to be four bottles of whiskey a day - it's not now.'

2008 - Gascoigne was sectioned after reportedly wielding a steak knife in the Malmaison hotel in Newcastle.

The
 hotel's manager said at the time that he was 'potentially a menace to other 
guests. The guests in the room next to him were moved out as they felt 
intimidated.'

Gascoigne leaves Newcastle Magistrates Court in 2010 after getting a suspended sentence for drink driving

2010 - Gascoigne appeared at the scene of a tense police stand-off with killer Raoul Moat, reportedly claiming he had brought the gunman 'a can of lager, some chicken, a fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown'.

He later said of the incident: 'I thought, "Moaty won’t shoot me, I’m good friends with him". I thought I knew him, but I’d been drinking.'

Later that year he was given a suspended prison sentence for drink-driving after magistrates heard he was four times the legal limit.

2013 - After slurring his words and appearing confused in a charity stage show, Gascoigne was again sent to the US for treatment. Footballers past and present and friends Chris Evans and cricketer Ronnie Irani contributed to his rehab fund. After returning to Britain, he was found slumped outside a London hotel.

He was later fined £1,000 for assaulting a railway security guard in Stevenage and being drunk and disorderly.

2014 - Earlier this year, Gascoigne again entered an extensive rehabitilition programme at a £6,000-a-month clinic in Southhampton, the seventh time he had entered such a facility.

He received treatment again last year after appearing confused at a charity function in Northampton
