BMW says it's taking the extraordinary step of unveiling the entire range of its next generation 6-series in one fell swoop later this month at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

That includes the new drop-top BMW 6 Series Convertible as well as the Coupe and Gran Coupe versions.

They will be unveiled simultaneously on January 9 in freezing Motown before becoming the centrepieces of the BMW stand.

Top speeds are limited electronically to 155mph but the cabriolet will sprint from rest to 62 mph in just 5.5 seconds while the M6 version will knock that down to 4.3 seconds.

All three body styles have a choice of highly efficient twinpower turbo six-cylinder and V8 engines linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 3-litre 313 bhp turbodiesel in the 640d models and 3-litre 320 bhp petrol unit in the 640i version are low in emission, as low as 139g/km for the 640d SE Coupe.

The 650i models feature 4.4-litre V8 bi-turbo engines. Ultimate performance is from the 560bhp V8-engined M6 variant.

All petrol models have a sportstuned exhaust system with a switch to provide a soundtrack to match the car's performance.

Suspension systems have been honed and can be personalised.

Full LED headlights are standard. There are new 18 in alloy wheels for the Coupe and Convertible, and five new metallic paint finishes . Dakota, Nappa or Merino leather trim will be standard in the UK, depending on model.

The 6 Series and its M equivalents are on sale here from March 1, from £50,000 to £100,000.

Legendary former Jaguar test driver and works racer Norman Dewis — whose epic through-the-night driving feat from Coventry to Geneva helped launch the original E-Type — has received an OBE in the New Year Honours List.

The sprightly 94-year-old spent 33 years at Jaguar and is widely regarded as Britain's greatest test driver.

He helped develop 25 of its most famous models, including the Le Mans-winning D-type and influential E-type and also set a land speed record for Jaguar and competed in many races for the marque during the Fifties.

Dewis is one of the last living links to the post-war golden era of the British motor industry, when Jaguar rebuilt itself into a champion sports car maker.

During his career, he completed more than a million test miles at an average speed of 100 mph-plus and survived high-speed crashes in the days before seatbelts, without ever breaking a single bone. He played a vital role in developing the revolutionary Dunlop disc brake and was Sir Stirling Moss's co-driver in a C-type in the 1952 Mille Miglia.

In 1953 he set a 172.412 mph production car speed record in a modified Jaguar XK 120 in Belgium.

Of all the cars he worked on, he considers the D-type to be the best: 'I got that car up to 192 mph on the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans.' More recently at the 2014 Goodwood Revival, he drove one of the 60th anniversary D-types, proving he hadn't lost his touch.

John Edwards, MD Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations, says: 'Jaguar owes a huge debt to Norman. His incredible skills have resulted in some of the finest cars this company has ever made.'

BBC Top Gear presenter James May has chosen his 13 'most significant cars of all time' for a special display at The London Classic Car Show.

The result is 'The Cars That Changed The World' exhibit at the show taking place at EXCEL in London's Docklands from January 8 to 11.

They range from the 1886 Benz Motorwagen — the first true automobile — to the 1997 Toyota Prius, described as the 'first mainstream car to rethink the basics of how a car should work'.
