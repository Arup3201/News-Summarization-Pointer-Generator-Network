Emile Heskey wouldn't think twice about completing a sensational return to Leicester City should he get a call from Nigel Pearson.

The 36-year-old is currently without a club after a two-year stint in Australia with the Newcastle Jets.

And, given the Foxes have room in their Premier League squad to add extra bodies, signing Heskey on a short-term contract could appeal.

Appearances: 196

Goals: 46 

Honours: League Cup (1997, 2000) 

It's something the striker has pondered and is receptive to.

'It goes without saying, I'd love to come,' Heskey told BBC Radio Leicester.

'It is a great club that allowed me to get to the platform that I got to.

'I was an England international when I was with Leicester so that was a great achievement.'

Heskey left Filbert Street for £11million when Liverpool came knocking 14 years ago and ended up winning 62 caps for England, although supporters are split on whether a return is in the club's best interests.

Pearson's side are struggling – they haven't scored in five games and are in the bottom three – but the front man believes the newly-promoted side can stay up.

'They have got a decent squad there, they just need that little pick me up, a little confidence,' he added.

'It could be anything, just a spark to get going on a run to get out of it.'
