The human remains of missing nursing student Michelle Le were found by the mother of a girl who was raped and killed two years ago.

The body of Miss Le, 26, who disappeared in May, was found on Saturday in a canyon off a secluded dirt track near San Francisco, California.

Carrie McGonigle, mother of Amber Dubois, 14, who was raped and killed by sex offender John Gardner III in San Diego in 2009, found the remains.

Ms McGonigle and her Labrador dog - 
also called Amber - were searching in Pleasanton and found the body last weekend, which was later identified.

Marc Klaas told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'Carrie happened to be the right 
person on the right team at the right place at the right time.'

Mr Klaas’s own daughter Polly, 12, was 
kidnapped and killed by Richard Allen Davis in 1993. His KlaasKids 
Foundation helped out in the search.

He added the find would be 'of great 
personal satisfaction to Carrie' and Amber would be looking down on her 
mother with 'pride' and a 'big smile'.

The Alameda County coroner has not yet ruled how Miss Le died. Her family are planning a memorial service for her.

The prime suspect is the case is 
Giselle Esteban, 27, of Union City. She has not yet entered a 
plea but is back in court next Wednesday.

Esteban, who is pregnant, knew Miss Le in high school in San Diego and was arrested earlier this month and charged with murder.

Miss Le was reported missing after 
she failed to return from a break during her shift at the Kaiser 
Permanente Medical Center in Hayward.

Her white Honda SUV was later seen driving out of the garage by video surveillance later that evening in May.

The vehicle was found abandoned a few blocks away and it was unclear whether the student was driving it or not.

Police believe an assault happened at 
the hospital’s car park as CCTV shows Esteban at the scene 
before and after Miss Le’s disappearance.

Detectives said they found traces of Miss 
Le’s blood inside her SUV, as well as on one of Esteban’s shoes during a
search of Esteban’s home.

Esteban told KGO-TV at the time that she hated Miss Le because she was friends with the father of Esteban’s young daughter.

But Esteban insisted she had nothing to do with her disappearance.

Esteban’s ex-boyfriend, who had 
custody of their daughter, got a restraining order against her three 
days before Miss Le’s disappearance.

Miss Le’s family had offered a $100,000 reward for her return or details on her whereabouts. She attended Oakland's Samuel Merritt University.

Amber's killer Gardner - a registered sex offender who is
also responsible for last year's death of teenager Chelsea King - is 
serving a life sentence.
