A motorist who drove his car over a 40ft cliff was able to walk away from the accident without serious injuries.

The suspected drunk driver refused to allow paramedics to treat him at the scene of the crash in San Diego.

The man, who has not been named, drove his sedan over the steep bluff in the early hours of yesterday morning.

To reach the shoreline he had already smashed through a lock gate at high speed, police told U-T San Diego.

The man got out of his car and started wandering around the beach and in the water, ignoring bystanders on the cliff above.

His car landed the correct way up and was relatively undamaged, although the back end appeared to have been damaged in the fall.

When witnesses called 911, firefighters, paramedics and lifeguards arrived at the scene, some swimming to the cove and others being lowered down by a hoist.

However, the man initially refused to receive treatment despite his injuries.

One paramedic told U-T San Diego, 'He was fighting, screaming and yelling.'

Eventually rescue workers managed to calm him down, and the man was airlifted to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he is being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

He was suspected of having been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident, according to police.

The car remained on the beach for several hours, being lapped by the waves, until it was finally removed by a tow truck.

Dozens of bystanders gathered around the cliff in the Sunset Cliffs area to watch the operation unfold.
