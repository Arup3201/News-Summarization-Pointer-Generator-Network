Brendan Rodgers defended himself from criticism as he insisted he had fielded a strong side to take on Real Madrid.

The Liverpool boss dropped seven first-team players top take on the European champions at the Bernabeu with captain Steven Gerrard, Mario Balotelli, Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling, Glen Johnson among those missing out.

The high-profile omissions prompted a debate as to whether the Reds had contravened UEFA's subjective Rule 4.01, subsection D - which states that it is a team's duty 'to play in the competition until their elimination and to field their strongest team throughout the competition.'

Brendan Rodgers insisted the Liverpool starting XI against Real Madrid was a 'strong team'

UEFA article 4.01d; On entering the competition, participating clubs should play in the competition until their elimination and to field their strongest team throughout the competition. 

It is unlikely that Liverpool will need to explain the selection to UEFA chiefs, however.

Speaking to ITV before the match, Rodgers responded to claims travelling fans would be disappointed by the selection and said: 'I'd be surprised if they're disappointed. We've got a strong team for the game, we're not forfeiting.'

The Liverpool boss claimed the players taking to the field against Real Madrid deserved a chance having played in the Capital One Cup victory against Swansea last week.
