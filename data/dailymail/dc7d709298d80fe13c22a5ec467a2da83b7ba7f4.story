Women need a change in the law to stop their jilted ex-partners publishing explicit pictures of them on the internet, Maria Miller said yesterday. 

The former Tory cabinet minister is campaigning for the Government to ban the rising tide of 'revenge porn' ruining women's lives.

Campaigners say it is a fast-growing trend with up to 30 websites in the UK already being used by former boyfriends and husbands to post humiliating pictures of their one-time lovers.

Ministers are in talks about changing the law to stop ex-partners posting sexual images online

Victims find the images are impossible to remove -  as they are reproduced on a host of other websites within minutes often with their name and sometimes even their contact details.

Mrs Miller said they 'can destroy somebody's career, destroy their relationships and the recourse is very patchy indeed'.

There is currently no law which addresses the practice.

When she was Culture Secretary, Mrs Miller helped to crack down on vile child abuse and rape images online, and drew up plans for an automatic block on explicit sites unless households opt in.

Speaking to the Mail in her first interview since stepping down, Mrs Miller said a new law to ban revenge porn was urgently needed. She is in talks with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who is backing her campaign.

'This is a form of sexual violence against women in our own country', Mrs Miller said. 'The issue is explicit and nude pictures being posted on the internet without an individuals' consent.

'These are not taken in a studio, they are taken in someone's front room and clearly not meant for public release. This is not one or two people, this is quite widespread.

'What I want to do is run faster than 
the internet and make sure we have the right legal protection in place 
for these women. My fear is that there will be a lot of women who are 
suffering in silence.'

Mrs 
Miller was forced to step down from the Cabinet in April after a storm 
about expenses she claimed for her home, for which she was forced to 
repay £5,800. She is still MP for Basingstoke.

As
 a minister she was responsible for women's issues, and said as a 
backbencher she would focus on helping women 'achieve their potential 
and have the same protection as other members of society'

She
 will be holding the first parliamentary debate on revenge porn today 
(thurs) to try and raise awareness among MPs, and said police and social
 media sites need training in how to handle it.

Currently
 there are only laws preventing 'malicious communications', which 
usually involves written abuse not pictures, and harassment laws which 
usually require a number of offences.

The
 Ministry of Justice will look at how existing sexual offences laws 
could be amended to outlaw the distribution of sexual images without the
 person's consent.

Justice 
Secretary Chris Grayling said yesterday: 'This sort of behaviour is 
deeply abhorrent and motivated solely by a desire to cause harm and 
embarrassment.  It's not acceptable.  

'If
 there is a gap that we need to address in making sure that individuals 
who do this sort of thing are properly brought to book, then it can only
 be right that we look at ways it might be closed.'

Mrs
 Miller said MPs should not tell people how to behave in their private 
lives, but try to alert women to the 'dangers' of sharing images.

Mrs Miller said MPs should not tell people how to behave in their private lives, but try to alert women to the 'dangers' of sharing images.

Charities say nearly half (45 per cent) of domestic violence cases involve an element of online abuse. 'There's a very close link', Mrs Miller said. Distributing pictures like this really is just another form of domestic violence and yet at the moment there are few – of any – convictions.

'If you posted explicit pictures of someone in the pub, the landlord would take them down and probably call the police, and it shouldn't be any different online'.

The practice is now so widespread in America, three states have enacted laws against it.

'In Britain this is the lull before the storm, we must clamp down before it really takes off', she said.

Polly Neate, Chief Executive of Women's Aid said: 'Revenge porn, like all domestic violence, is about control. Perpetrators use the threat of humiliating a woman by sharing intimate images or videos to keep women trapped in relationships; and they harass and intimidate women who have left them by posting such files online.'
