Even in death, legendary American racehorse Native Diver is making moves.

The remains of Native Diver are being exhumed at the recently-closed Hollywood Park racetrack to be moved to Del Mar.

Native Diver was the seventh thoroughbred to win a million dollars and the first to do so in California.

USC students, seen here, helped in the dig

Archaeologists Lynn Swartz Dodd said the dig was unusual, because 'Usually archaeologists are digging at sites that are a minimum of 50 years ago or earlier'

Hollywood Park was Native Diver's hometown track but it closed last December after years of declining revenue.

The racetrack will soon be replaced by an office building and shopping complex, but before that Native Diver's old owners decided to dig up the horse so that he could rest in a more appropriate location.

'He's racing royalty,' Richard Shapiro told the Los Angeles Times. 60-year-old Shapiro is the grandson of the man who bred Native Diver. 'You couldn't leave a horse like this beneath a real estate development.'

Archaeologists Lynn Swartz Dodd and Tom Garrison are leading the dig, with the help of about a dozen students at the University of Southern California and were wrapping up the two-day dig on Sunday.

Dodd told MailOnline that the dig was unique in that Native Diver was buried 'relatively recently'.

'Usually archaeologists are digging at sites that are a minimum of 50 years ago or earlier. Also, it's a bit unusual because most USC professors spend their time diffing outside the United States and this was the opportunity to work with our students locally.'

Native Diver made headlines when he died just eight days after winning the Del Mar Handicap in 1967.

At the dig site in Hollywood Park on Saturday, Garrison pointed out the racehorse emerging from the earth.

'He actually looks like he's running,' Garrison said. 'He never stopped.'

Once fully-exhumed, Native Diver will be moved to Del Mar racetrack about 100 miles south.

Dodd says she and her students found 
Native Diver buried in a canvas bag and the nails from his horse shoes 
were still visible on the hooves.

The
 dig presented some challenges, like the fact that they had to move a 
40,000-pound statue placed on top of the burial site while also working 
around a recently leaked sewer pipe.

'Thankfully we have not found anyone else's skeleton,' Dodd joked.
