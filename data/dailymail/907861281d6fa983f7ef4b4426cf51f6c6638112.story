A British Airways manager is facing disciplinary action after he made a series of vile comments about Andy Murray's mother's looks.

Area manager Simon Taylor, from Staines, Surrey, made the cruel comments on his Facebook page as Judy Murray was watching her son win the men's final at Wimbledon.

Among the comments he compared her to a 'recently salted slug' and 'a manatee's spleen'.

The 46-year-old, who is in charge of 
1,500 cabin crew, allegedly made a number of comments on his Facebook page according to The Sun.

His comments came after a cabin crew dispute in which Mr Taylor had to discipline staff for comments they made on Facebook.

The airline has stressed Mr Taylor has since apologised for his comments and said they are taking the matter 'seriously'.

A BA spokesman said: 'We are sorry for one of our staff's behaviour. He has publicly apologised on his Facebook site for his inappropriate postings while he was off duty and has taken them down.

'We are taking this matter seriously.'

The incident comes after BBC 
presenter John Inverdale was labelled a 'sexist moron' by viewers after 
he made disparaging comments about Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli.

The
corporation received 674 complaints and was forced to issue an apology 
after the presenter said the French star was 'never going to be a 
looker'.

He tried to 
draw a line under the matter the following day by explaining his 
comments on air and sending an apologetic letter to Bartoli.

But
despite the player saying the incident 'doesn't matter', Inverdale was 
hit by a backlash from listeners who said his apology was 'inadequate'.
