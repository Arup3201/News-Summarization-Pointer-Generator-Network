The son of Bernie Madoff faces a struggle to find a home because realtors are refusing to rent to the family of the disgraced financier.

Andrew Madoff, 45, and his fiancee Catherine Hooper have been looking for a home in New York so that his children can go to school.

Ms Hooper, 39, shows up alone to view homes around $20,000 a month in downtown Manhattan after making the appointments under her name.

However once it becomes clear who Hooper is then the couple are rejected, according to the New York Post.

The couple have been looking for a home in the desirable areas of TriBeCa and the West Village.

Andrew Madoff's father Bernie was arrested on December 11, 2008, following his $65 billion Ponzi scheme which became the largest financial fraud in history.

Now 74, Bernie is serving a 150-year term in a North Carolina prison. Andrew has said he will never speak to his father again.

Andrew's brother, Mark, 46, hanged himself 
with a dog leash on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. He 
had wanted his mother Ruth to cut off all contact with his father.

The other Madoffs have always claimed to have known nothing about Bernie's Ponzi scheme.

However defrauded Madoff investors have 
long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member 
suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his 
lies. No family members have been criminally charged.

In March, Andrew Madoff rented out the apartment he brought for $4.37 million in October 2008 for $25,000 a month.

The 3,215-square-foot residence is 
spread over the entire fifth floor of Lux74, a condominium in 
Manhattan's Upper East Side, and will be available to rent from the 
beginning of July.

Ms Hooper, a former fashion consultant, became engaged to Andrew Madoff just weeks before his father's scandal broke in 2008.
