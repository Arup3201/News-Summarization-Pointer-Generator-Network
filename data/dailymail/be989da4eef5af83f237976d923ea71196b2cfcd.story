A father has hit out at fast food giant McDonald's, claiming that his six-year-old daughter chipped her tooth on a bone measuring more than half an inch after biting into a chicken McNugget.

Paige Wilding-Merry, from Lytham St Annes near Blackpool, was eating her Happy Meal, purchased from The Cherry Tree Road McDonald's in Blackpool, when she bit into a nugget and chipped her tooth.

Stephen Merry, 33, told her to spit out the nugget after claiming he spotted a bone measuring 0.7 inches hidden in the piece of chicken.

His daughter will now no longer eat the meat. 'She's scared to eat chicken now because she was horrified,' Mr Merry said.

As soon as Paige spat out the piece of food, he knew that a bone was hidden inside.

'You could see it was a proper chicken bone because the marrow was still in it,' he said.

The furious father is now asking McDonald's to investigate how the bone found its way into his daughter's Happy Meal.

The fast food chain has said it will look into the matter once the bone is returned.

Mr Merry said: 'I phoned them and they were very apologetic and asked me to send it in but I'm not sure what to do because they will just say 'it wasn't us' and here's a free McDonald's.

'I'm afraid they are going to turn around and say it's not our fault.'

When McDonald's was asked to comment on the complaint, a spokesman confirmed that the bone would need to be returned.

The spokesman said: 'We are sorry for Mr Merry's and his daughter's experience when visiting our restaurant.

'Food safety and product quality are our highest priority, and both our restaurants and our suppliers place great emphasis on quality control in order to avoid imperfections in our products.

'Our customer services department has been in touch with Mr Merry and once we receive the object we will be able to investigate this further.'
