Before every training session, Tony Pulis reminded his players that Brendan Rodgers wasn't a fan of Crystal Palace and their football.

Liverpool's manager had them down as a primitive Premier League team who would rely on 'long balls and long throws-ins'.

He called it wrong, catastrophically so. After this extraordinary comeback by Palace, recovering from 3-0 down to draw 3-3, Rodgers must play the long game.

Centre of attention: Brendan Rodgers oversees his side's dramatic draw at Crystal Palace on Monday night

Liverpool's manager has accepted 
that their chances of winning the title are over. Well done Manchester 
City and good luck, he said. Truth be told Rodgers under-estimated 
Palace and this incredible match will surely be remembered as the night 
when Liverpool blew the title.

When
 Dwight Gayle scored Palace's third goal, there is no stadium in the 
country that has experienced a noise level like it this season. The 
corrugated iron roofs of the Main Stand, Arthur Wait and Holmesdale Road
 at Selhurst Park nearly flew into the night sky. Rodgers, standing on 
the edge of the technical area, turned to his assistant, Colin Pascoe. 
They knew, as everybody else knows, they could not win the Premier 
League title from there.

Rodgers'
 team, including the newly crowned Football Writers' Footballer of the 
Year, Luis  Suarez, have been left shredded. They have nothing left to 
give.

Gayle, who also 
scored in Palace's defeat at Liverpool in October, has barely been able 
to get a game this season and yet he scored two remarkable goals. What a
 night for him.

Inconsolable: Steven Gerrard comforts Luis Suarez

A 
point still sent Rodgers's team top of the table, but it will mean 
nothing to them after what was a catastrophic capitulation.

If
 this was Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal or City, we would be 
talking about whether the  manager was the right man for the job. That's
 what the Premier League does, it chews managers up and spits them out.

At
 this level, with a title to play for, you can't surrender and get away 
with it. Fortunately, Rodgers has enough credit in the bank to go 
forward next season.

Rodgers
 has paid for his inexperience after his side lost a critical game 
against Chelsea at Anfield last week and tossed away a three-goal lead. 
How did they manage to do it?

Maybe
 we will never know. It was incredible. But Liverpool's title challenge 
all came so suddenly for Rodgers, way ahead of schedule after spending 
his first season in charge of Liverpool figuring it all out. Season two has been an extraordinary journey and yet now it has suddenly hit the buffers.

Game over: Surely Liverpool's dreams of winning the Premier League title ended on Monday night

Champions
 League football next season will be a gamechanger for this club, 
however, and Rodgers is already making noises about  signing five or six
 players to cope with the group phase before the turn of the year.

Liverpool
 will, therefore, operate with a swollen squad and, juggling that will 
in itself be another test of this manager's ability. Just look how it 
turned out for David Moyes at Manchester United, where every member of 
the squad expected to play. He couldn't cope.

Everyone
 wants to play Champions League football, but the bar is high and the 
standard is on another level. They have to live with that and somehow 
fight it out for a place in the top four again next season. Suddenly the
 task feels enormous.

End of the road: Rodgers conceded the title to rivals Manchester City after Liverpool's 3-3 draw at Palace

In support: Tony Pulis has performed a minor miracle since taking over at Crystal Palace

Rodgers
 will be ready, steadying himself after his trip to the World Cup in the
 summer to scout for the players he needs. In a few weeks he will be in 
Brazil and it will give the Liverpool  manager a chance to reflect on 
the events of the final games of a  Premier League season.

They
 are a massive test of nerve, something Rodgers has never experienced 
before as a Premier League manager. He spoke of giving this title chase 
away, his players attempting to play 'Roy of the Rovers football' in an 
attempt to pulverise Palace. They were 3-0 up at the time and suddenly, 
bafflingly, they were back level at 3-3.

After this, Rodgers will look to the long term.
