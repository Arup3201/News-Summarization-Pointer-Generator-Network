A mother who tried to cover up for her son after he killed a pensioner in last summer’s riots was jailed yesterday.

Lavinia Desuze, 31, destroyed her son Darrell’s clothes after spotting him in television footage of the looting and vandalism that spread throughout London.

Although she knew that the 17-year-old  had killed a man and that police had arrested the wrong person, Desuze callously cut up his clothes and dumped them in a bin to protect him.

Yesterday, Desuze, of Hounslow, West 
London, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for perverting the course 
of justice while Darrell, who lived with her, was jailed for eight years
for the manslaughter of Richard Mannington Bowes on August 8 last year.

Outside court yesterday, Anne Wilderspin, Mr Bowes’s sister, said Darrell had committed a ‘terrible crime’.

But she added: ‘I was completely devastated. I feel compassion for this youngster, who was only 16 at the time.

‘He has potentially ruined his life, 
or any decent chance of making an honest living in the future. I have 
forgiven him, and being a Christian, I pray to Lord Jesus that he will 
turn over a new leaf.’

During the trial, prosecutor Brian 
Altman QC told the court how Desuze knew her son had been responsible 
for Mr Bowes’s death. He added: ‘Unlike others who turned in their own 
children, horrified at what they had seen them do, she sought to prevent
him from facing the justice he deserved.’

Mr Justice John Saunders said of 
Desuze, who gave birth to Darrell at 14 and raised him as a single 
mother: ‘I accept the instinct of a mother to protect her child is a 
very powerful one.

‘If she had felt able to admit what 
she had done, it would have made it easier to be lenient. Instead she 
continued to deny committing any offence and, on the verdict of the 
jury, lied on oath.’

The court also heard how 6ft  Darrell 
had ‘played a full part in  the violence’ as disorder swept the country 
last summer. He was seen on CCTV smashing windows, looting shops, 
throwing missiles at police and wheeling rubbish bins into the street to
be set on fire.

The teenager attacked Mr Bowes as the 
68-year-old ventured outside his home in Ealing, West London, to put out
one of those fires.

Mr Bowes, a former accountant, 
suffered brain damage hitting his head on the pavement after being 
punched by Darrell. He died three days later.

Mr Justice Saunders said at Inner 
London Crown Court yesterday that he had taken into account the teen’s 
guilty pleas to burglary and violent disorder. And he described Darrell,
then aged 16, as a ‘willing participant’ in the riots who was recorded 
looting shops even after he had killed Mr Bowes.

Mr Justice Saunders said: ‘I do  
consider that it is a significant aggravating factor that, having 
rendered  his victim unconscious and realising that he had done him 
serious harm, he then went on to... loot four shops.  The death of Mr 
Bowes was pointless and unnecessary and it became for  the public one of
the most, if not the most, shocking event of the riots  in London.’

Nicholas Valios, defending, insisted 
that Darrell had felt remorse for his actions: ‘Despite his conduct he 
did not intend to cause Mr Bowes any serious injury, let alone his 
death.’
