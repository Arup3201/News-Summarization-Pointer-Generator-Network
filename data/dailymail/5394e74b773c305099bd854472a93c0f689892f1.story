Lord Walton of Detchant said older peers would be willing to stand aside, if they were given a 'retirement gratuity'

Elderly peers are offering to retire from the House of Lords - but only if they get a huge pay-off equivalent to a year’s expenses.

The extraordinary proposal is being actively discussed in the corridors of Parliament.

It even appears to have the backing of a Tory Cabinet minister, after Lord Strathclyde revealed he is keen to create a ’retirement scheme’.

Under existing rules, peers are not able to retire from the House of Lords. The only way the number of people sitting eligible to sit on the red benches can be reduced easily is if they die.

There
are around 770 peers able to sit in the House of Lords. One in five is 
over 80 and around half are over 70 years old. Some 20 per cent have 
been in the Lords for more than 20 years.

With scores of new appointments made by successive governments, many of whom are comparatively young, numbers have ballooned.

Now
peers are openly discussing the idea of older members being eased out, 
but only if they are handed a bounty worth potentially more than 
£40,000.

Lord Walton of Detchant said: ‘A 
number of noble Lords of mature years have indicated that they might 
consider the possibility of honourable voluntary retirement given an 
incentive— say, in the form of a retirement gratuity equivalent to the 
expenses that they had claimed in the previous year?’

The House of Lords has swelled to some 760 peers, with an average age of 69

Peers are able to claim £300 for each day 
they attend. With the house sitting for around 145 days a year, it means
they could claim up to £43,500.

Lord
Walton warned that without a golden goodbye, elderly peers would not be
persuaded to step aside. ‘Some have indicated that, in the absence of 
such an incentive, it is likely that they would continue to stay in the 
House indefinitely.’

Nick
Clegg’s attempt to introduce elected peers was abandoned in the summer,
after David Cameron made clear he could not persuade his Tory MPs to 
back it.

Tory Cabinet minister Lord Strathclyde said he was open to the idea of peers being able to retire

But Tory Cabinet minister Lord Strathclyde encouraged those wanting a pay-off to retire from the red benches to come forward. Around 40 peers have died since the general election, he said.

‘It is likely that we will lose a similar number between now and the next general election. I have heard it whispered in the corridors that the House is increasingly keen to debate and discuss some form of retirement scheme, including an age limit. I very much welcome all those who wish to come forward with such thoughts.’

Lib Dem peer Lord Steel introduced a Bill earlier this year which would allow peers to retire. It would also anyone who had been to jail from returning to the red benches and give authorities tougher powers to suspend members.

But so far it has not been backed by the government and stands little chance of becoming law.

Instead, two Tory peers jailed for expenses fraud are back in the Lords, and claiming public money again.

From April to June Lord Hanningfield, the former Conservative leader of Essex county council, received £8,481. And Lord Taylor of Warwick claimed £2,100 for seven days in June.
