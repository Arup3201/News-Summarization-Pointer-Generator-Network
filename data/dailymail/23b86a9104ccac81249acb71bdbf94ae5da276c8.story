After a photo of a man who had fallen asleep against a nearby subway passenger for more than half an hour went viral, the charity Charidy set out on a subway mission.

They group wanted to find out how many others would rise to the occasion of helping those around them -- and how many would simply  shrug it off.

Perhaps surprisingly, more people than you might have guessed seemed to be okay with the idea.

The one that started it all: A young man finds a moment of respite against the shoulder of Jewish riding the subway home from work

Public transportation often lacks adequate personal space but the reaction of some people was quite surprising

The idea began after a photo of a young African American guy nodded off on the shoulder of a Jewish man.

The man doesn’t move a muscle and instead just let him stay there.

Even when other passengers asked if they
 wanted the man to be woken, his fellow passenger simply shook his head 
responding, ‘He must have had a long day, let him sleep. We’ve all been 
there, right?’

Shoulder to lean on: People are not quite as uptight as you might think - even on the New York City subway where space is at a premium

Not now buddy: Of course there were one or two who found the moment a little awkward

As I lay thee down to sleep: It seemed that most people simply went along with it

In this latest example of New Yorkers showing kindness to their fellow travelers, Charidy say that it is a 'wonderful reminder that every moment is a chance to do something good for another person. And not only that, but inspire the others around us with our small but powerful actions.'

This strange but surprisingly heartwarming social experiment seems to bring out the best in many New Yorkers.

You don't mind if I...? Even if people found the whole experience strange and slightly disturbing, most got a laugh from it

Feeling sleepy again? Perhaps this guy has narcolepsy!

You'll make a nice pillow: It's a sweet reminder that not all New Yorkers live up to their unfriendly reputation
