From Prince 
Harry and One Direction's Liam losing their mobiles recently to Rihanna breaking a police sergeant's phone by accident, it seems nobody is immune to phone mishaps.

And new research reveals the average Briton is just as clumsy as the stars when it comes to their mobiles as almost three quarters (72 per cent) admit to making cringeworthy phone blunders.

Whether it's leaving their phone on the 
car roof before driving off or sending a message with an autocorrect 
mistake, most of us have been left red-faced thanks to our phones.

A third (33 per cent) of blushing Britons have mistakenly called or texted the wrong person

The most common 'phone pas' is found to be finger fumbling with two fifths of Britons (41 per cent) admitting to red faces after accidentally pressing the wrong button on their phone.

A third (33 per cent) of blushing 
Britons have mistakenly called or texted the wrong person whilst 19 per 
cent admit to misplacing their phone in their own home - losing it down the sofa or even somehow putting it in the washing machine.

With growing dependence on mobile phones, it's not surprising that the 'phone pas' is on the rise.

Receiving a text that doesn't make sense annoys a third (30 per cent) of Britons

Being rushed or in a hurry is the top reason for the UK's phone pas with a third (31 per cent) citing this as the most common reason, with women (35 per cent) more susceptible than men (28 per cent).

A quarter (26 per 
cent) blame their phone pas on being 'forgetful or absent-minded'.

1.
 Someone playing loud music/audio out of their phone speakers or talking
 to loudly on the phone (56 per cent)

2. Someone bumping into you whilst
 using their phone (40 per cent)

3. Receiving a text that doesn't make 
sense (30 per cent)

4. Getting a pocket dial or accidental text or call 
(23 per cent)

5. Catching someone snooping on your phone (23 per cent)

Despite one in 10 Britons committing 
phone pas at least once a week, three in five (62 per cent) admit that 
they do not take any precautions to protect their phone.

Only a quarter (27 per cent) use a password on their mobile phone and one in 10 protect their phone with a security app.

A spokesperson for the
 Lookout Mobile Security app, who commissioned the research, said: 
'People are very much aware that their phone could fall into the wrong 
hands, but they don't necessarily consider what happens in their own 
hands.

'It's just as important to protect mobile phones from ourselves - 
after all we are all mistake makers, we're only human!'

Accidentally wiping contacts and cracking the phone screen featured in the top ten phone pas

1. Finger fumbling (41 per cent)

2. Calling/texting the wrong person (33 per cent)

3. Pocket dialling (27 per cent)

4. Predictive text fail (25 per cent)

5. 'Losing' your phone at home (19 per cent)

6. Accidentally wiping contacts (17 per cent)

7. Cracking phone screen (15 per cent)

8. Face drop whilst lying down (14 per cent)

9. Accidentally playing music / audio out of phone speakers (13 per cent)
