A woman had to be rescued by firefighters from the balcony of her fourth-floor flat after she was locked out.

Fire crews and two engines were called to the incident at the Keppel Wharf development in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and discovered the unidentified tenant was trapped outside.

Passer-by Peter Alderson captured the moment the woman was rescued from the balcony while the road was closed to traffic.

Operation: South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue had to extend a cherry picker up to the fourth floor of the building to help bring her down

He said: 'One of the firefighters told me that there's a fault with the locks in the building and has locked a few of its residents out in the past.'

He added: 'I always have a camera with me because I work for Nikon, and I had just come out of Tesco and saw the firefighter climb over the balcony and put a harness on the woman.

'I got her to wave at me, she seemed fairly happy and ok with it all.

'There was a bit of a crowd gathering and cars were backed up as the road was blocked off. I did not get a chance to speak to the woman.'

Property developers Iliad, who manage Keppel Wharf, declined to comment on the alleged faults with the balcony doors.

It is claimed firefighters have been sent to the address on more than one occasion to deal with the problematic doors.
