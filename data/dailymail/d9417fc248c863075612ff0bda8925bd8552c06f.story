He had driven on to the beach to make the most of the gorgeous evening sunshine.But as Paul Redfern and his daughter enjoyed the splendid seascape, they got that awful sinking feeling.

For their 4x4 became stuck in the soggy sand. And although they seemed a safe distance from the sea, within just 47 minutes the Vauxhall Frontera had disappeared beneath the waves. Mr Redfern and his daughter could only stand and watch as the tide raced in, thwarting a frantic effort to free the vehicle.

Mr Redfern, from Bristol, had driven his 13-year-old car on to Brean Beach in Somerset at about 6.30pm on Tuesday. But after about half a mile, its wheels got stuck in the soft sand and mud.

Lost in the sea: The Vauxhall Frontera's wheels got stuck in the soft sand and mud, leaving it stranded

Saying goodbye: Paul Redfern had driven his 13-year-old car half a mile down Brean Beach in Somerset

Danger: Parts of the Bristol Channel including Brean experience the second highest tidal range in the world

Engulfed by the tide: Ropes, spades and wooden boards were used to try and free the Vauxhall vehicle

Brean’s beachwarden raised the alarm 
and joined bystanders and a team from Burnham Area Rescue Boat’s search 
and rescue crew in a desperate attempt to save the car. The 12-strong 
team tried using ropes, spades, wooden boards and even a JCB digger – 
all to no avail.

Brean, on 
the Bristol Channel, experiences one of the biggest tidal ranges in the 
world, with sea coming in more than a mile. Tuesday’s strong onshore 
winds only increased the speed with which it rose.

It
 is not known whether insurers will cover the loss of the £1,500 car, 
which was finally towed from the beach by tractor yesterday afternoon.

Trying to free it: A team from Burnham Area Rescue Boat Search and Rescue was quickly on the scene

Not coming out: A JCB digger and two trucks were forced to turn back due to the conditions on the beach

Help: Mr Redfern had been driving along the beach with his daughter and 'didn't think I could get stuck'

Gone: The soft sand around the car made it impossible for other vehicles to get close enough to pull it free

A
 spokesman for the rescue crew said: ‘The 4x4 looks in a sorry state. It
 had two tides go over it, one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday morning, 
and had sunk into the sand under the water so was in nearly the same 
area as where it was first submerged.

‘Parking
 is allowed at the top of the beach but is discouraged further down. We 
recover vehicles quite frequently, but in this case the tide got there 
before we were able to free it.’

Mr
 Redfern said: ‘I’m very grateful for the efforts of everyone. It’s 
gutting that we couldn’t get it out in time but I do thank them for 
trying.

‘I’d just been driving along the beach with my daughter enjoying the sunshine and didn’t think I could get stuck.’

It
 is the latest in a series of similar mishaps in the area. Days earlier a
 Ford Focus estate parked on the beach was engulfed by the tide and 
written off, and at least four other cars have become stranded since 
March.s of treacherous mudflats.
