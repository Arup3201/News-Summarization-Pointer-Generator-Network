The Catholic Church is seeking the opinions of ordinary people on gay unions, contraception and sex before marriage, in an extraordinary bid to become more ‘credible’.

A questionnaire has been sent from the Vatican polling lay parishioners as well as bishops and theologians on its teachings on all issues affecting families and relationships including divorce and single parent families.

The 38-question survey, which comes ahead of a meeting of the Synod on the Family in 2014, is the first time that the church has asked these questions of ordinary people since the 1960s.

'Strict' Pope Francis said the Vatican needs to tone down its strict teachings on the family

Catholic Church of England and Wales has already set up an online survey to make it easier for parishioners to give their opinions.

The questionnaire asks whether the Catholic teachings on marriage and the family ‘are widely known’ and ‘to what extent they are actually known, accepted, rejected and/or criticised in areas outside the Church.’

Pope Francis has already said the Vatican needs to tone down its strict teachings on the family. If the church continues ‘to obsess’ about issues such as divorce and abortion it ‘risks falling like a house of cards’, he said in September.

A letter from Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, Secretary General of the Synod, accompanying the questionnaire, was sent to bishops in every continent asking for them to distribute the poll "immediately as widely as possible to deaneries and parishes so that input from local sources can be received." Answers need to be returned by the end of January.

The feedback will help civil servants inside the Vatican prepare for the Synod of Bishops in October 2014. The theme of the meeting will be 'The Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelisation'.

An accompanying document sent out with the questionnaire said that Pope Francis is concerned with issues 'unheard of until a few years ago,' such as the 'widespread practice of cohabitation, which does not lead to marriage and sometimes even excludes the very idea of it, same-sex unions between persons who are, not infrequently, permitted to adopt children' and 'a culture of non-commitment.'

Also to be addressed will be 'forms of feminism hostile to the Church,' 'single-parent wombs for hire and new interpretations of what is considered a human right.'

The document notes that even within the Church, 'faith in the sacramentality of marriage and the healing power of the confession show signs of weakness or total abandonment'.

The move has already been welcomed by some as 'an outstretched hand' to dissidents.

Chicago’s archbishop Cardinal Francis George, said: 'The Vatican under Pope Francis seems to be offering an outstretched hand to the people of the church, but even more so, the Vatican is encouraging the bishops to be listeners to the voice of the people.'
