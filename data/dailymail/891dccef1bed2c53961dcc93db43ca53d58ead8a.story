Dragon: TV star and technology entrepreneur Peter Jones has struck a deal with the administrator of Jessops

Dragons' Den investor Peter Jones has struck a deal with the administrator of Jessops to keep the brand alive.

The technology entrepreneur, who owns internet specialist Phones International, has been locked in discussions over the terms of the deal and an announcement could be made as early as today.

This month accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers took the unusual step of almost immediately closing all of Jessops' 187 stores triggering the loss of up to 2,000 jobs.

Sources close to the discussions said Jones, who also owns technology website Expansys, is mainly interested in the brand but he could snap up some of the more profitable stores.

Administrators were appointed after it became clear Jessops had effectively run out of cash.

The chain, which can trace its roots to 1935, suffered tough Christmas trading, as consumers shift away from using cameras to smartphones which have their own high-quality cameras.

The high street faces a watershed year as families cut spending amid the cost-of-living squeeze, as well as the increasing shift to shopping online.

The administrator has said Mr Jones is among a 'number of buyers' to have bought assets from Jessops, although it is not clear how much he has paid.

The assets bought include its intellectual property and remaining stock, according to The Telegraph.

A spokesman for the administrator said: 'We can confirm that we have sold the brand and certain other assets to a number of buyers including entrepreneur Peter Jones.'

Turnaround group Hilco is also thought to have bought assets from Jessops.

The group, which took control of HMV by buying its debt, is believed to be looking into the possibility of installing Jessops concessions in HMV stores.
