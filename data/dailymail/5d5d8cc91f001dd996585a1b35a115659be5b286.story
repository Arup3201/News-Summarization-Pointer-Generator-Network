Passed-out: Susan Porfido-Gibson has been charged with child endangerment and drunken driving and is currently in jail on a $50,000 bond

Authorities say a New Jersey nanny passed out drunk while she was supposed to be watching a little boy, then fled and crashed her car into a fire hydrant when his mother got home.

Toms River Township police say 50-year-old Susan Porfido-Gibson, of Berkeley Township, was captured after the car crash.

She's charged with child endangerment and drunken driving, and also received numerous motor vehicle citations.

She was in jail on $50,000 bail and couldn't be reached for comment Saturday. It wasn't clear if she had a lawyer.

Police say her blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit when she was arrested Friday.

Authorities say the child's mother hired Porfido-Gibson through a child care website and left her son with Porfido-Gibson on Friday morning.

When the mother returned home in the early afternoon, authorities say, she found Porfido-Gibson passed out on the floor and her crying son with a soiled diaper.

When Porfido-Gibson came to, authorities say, she ran out the front door, stumbling and mumbling unintelligibly, then drove off.

A short time later, police say, her car struck a fire hydrant and dislodged it from the ground.

Authorities say three empty bottles of alcohol were found in her car, which had moderate front end damage.
