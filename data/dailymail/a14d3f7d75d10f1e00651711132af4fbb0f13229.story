A Florida woman thought herself to be lacking physically in the chest region took to the streets to raise money for a bust enhancement.

Carrying a hot pink sign that in bright blue capital letters read, 'Not Homeless Need Boobs,' Christina Andrews of Pensacola walked up and down the shoulder of a busy intersection raising money for her cosmetic surgery.

'I just want bigger boobs, because I’m not happy with the ones I have and I figured this was a good way to do it,' Andrews told WEAR-TV.

'People put out signs that they’re homeless. I’m not...so I’m just being honest.'

Florida drivers couldn't help but notice Andrews bright pink & blue sign decorated with butterflies and dragonflies

Her first time panhandling, Andrews was surprised how many drivers stopped to give her money for a boob job

To Andrews surprise many generous drivers stopped to donate some money towards her charitable cause.

'I thought people would just laugh and keep riding,' she told the news station, 'but they’re like, 
‘Hey - here’s some money.'

Whether they gave money took Andrews or not local drivers were unable to ignore the sign.

'[It] kind of flabbergasts you when you first look at it doesn't it?' one man told the news station.

Another young man commented of the sign, 'It's pretty crazy ... This one is the most uncommon one that you don't see very often.'
