Caravans from the Dale Farm travellers' site have upped sticks and set up an illegal camp 55 miles away leading residents to fear that many more are on their way.

Around 20 families have moved from Essex to Stockwood Park, close to Luton in Bedfordshire, after gaining access to a 100-hectare piece of land.

Those who stayed at Dale Farm, where travellers have been in a ten-year battle with Basildon Council, were given a last-minute reprieve from the High Court after a judge ruled that the proposed 
measures ‘may go further’ than the terms of the enforcement notices.

One of the travellers at the site said there were another 40 caravans on their way as people in Luton feared there would be a similar situation to that in Essex.

Although travellers own the Essex site near Basildon they only have planning consent for half the site. However, the whole area is strewn with mobile homes and they have been in a battle with the local council for the last ten years.

The Luton site is described as an 'athletics track' and 'riding centre'. Nearby there are golf and rugby clubs, and a children's playground.

Travellers first started pitching up on Monday night and it has been alleged that one man arrived in a mobile home, using bolt-cutters to break through the park gates, according to the Sun.

One of the travellers, Flint Devons, 29, claimed he had lived at Dale Farm for seven years. He said: 'I moved to Luton rather than wait for the bailiffs because my health was suffering. My son and daughter were already in schools in Essex. Then we had to move and lose it all.

'We came to Luton because we've been here before. The word has now spread back to Dale Farm. There'll be 20 to 40 more caravans coming from Dale Farm. We have nowhere else to go.'

People living near the site have 
criticised the police and local council for not responding more quickly.
One neighbour said: 'I used to look out of my bedroom window and see a 
beautiful park. Now it's caravans. I'm sure the gypsies won't cause 
trouble. Let's hope it stays that way.'

A
spokesman for Luton Borough Council said: 'The council was made aware 
of the encampment and immediately started the standard legal procedure 
for eviction. We expect to move them on very soon.'

Last stand: Kathleen McCarthy (centre) appealed to Prime Minister David Cameron to stop the eviction

In scenes bordering on farce, the 
eviction of Dale Farm began with an all-day stand-off and ended with yet
another legal hitch in a local council’s efforts to clear Europe’s 
largest illegal site earlier this week.

On one side were protesters and travellers insisting they shall not be moved. On the other, bailiffs and a small 
platoon of blue-uniformed officials spouting health and safety concerns 
through a loudhailer that didn’t work.

HARRY PHIBBS: For Basildon Council to have had to 
battle on behalf of their residents for ten years to get the illegal 
caravan site on Dale Farm evicted is absurd. The
cost to the Council of the whole operation could be up to £8million. 
Planning enforcement should be nothing like as long or as costly. Sorting out this mess will not be easier. But
rather than attack the Government for making the situation worse it 
should be recognised that they are restoring some semblance of sanity. Localism will help and the Government should press ahead with it.

But this long-awaited first stage in 
the Battle of Basildon was abruptly halted when a judge 
sitting 50 miles away granted a last-gasp injunction to delay further 
action.

Now the operation to clear the site 
has been put on hold until at least the end of the week after Mr Justice
Edwards-Stuart ruled at the High Court in London that the proposed 
measures ‘may go further’ than the terms of the enforcement notices.

Basildon Council was thrown into 
disarray last night as its lawyers scrambled to read through the 
injunction. Leader Tony Ball hurriedly left a television interview for 
an urgent briefing.

He didn’t explain the ruling when he 
returned to give a brief statement an hour later but said he was 'extremely disappointed and frustrated' by the decision.

He added: ‘The motion was put forward
to the High Court without notice, which meant the judge only had one 
side of the story and therefore has given the council until Friday to go
back to the High Court to make its argument.

‘I am absolutely clear that, in this 
issue on Friday, the court will find in the council’s favour and the 
clearance will be able to continue.’

The latest twist came as it was 
revealed that the travellers on the site at Crays Hill in Essex have 
been offered a total of 38 local authority homes to move from the site.

Danger: A sign of the barricade at Dale Farm warning that the 18-year-old girl attached by her neck will be killed if bailiffs open the gate

Basildon Council has suggested a variety of temporary flats and houses 
over the past six months in an effort to resolve the decade-long 
stand-off.

But they were turned down for reasons
including because they smelled of smoke or were made of bricks and 
mortar, 'contravening' the travellers' desire to spend their life on the
road.

A council spokesman said the 
injunction provided a 'blanket ban against the removal of any and all 
property' from the illegal camp.

A source later said they believed it 
might refer to the High Court order earlier this year which stated the 
eviction could go ahead and the concrete driveways, ‘hard standings’, 
the caravans stand on could be removed.

The source added they understood
this failed to refer to fences and some other structures on the 
hard-standings, creating a legal loophole.

News of the injunction brought whoops
of delight from travellers and supporters. One, who gave her name as 
Mary, said: 'Thank God for British justice.'

The travellers and 
troublemakers had manned the ramparts of their barricade from before 
dawn as police, the local council and bailiffs set up camp beside the 
main entrance.

Fifty-one plots containing homes 
built without planning permission are set to be cleared from the 
six-acre site, along with their remaining residents, in an operation 
which could cost £18million.

Like opposing armies, the two sides 
emerged into daylight in different uniforms – the authorities a mixture 
of orange, yellow and blue, versus the travellers’ preference for 
track-suits. For hours they could be seen making their 
separate preparations for war.

And every sign was that this is going to be a long campaign.

Reinforcements: Bailiffs move onto the site as the tense stand-off grew

If anyone needed confirmation, it 
came with the arrival of a stout traveller humping a consignment of 
supplies towards the gate. About 200 rolls of toilet paper in jumbo 
packs were pushed through a gap in the barricade to eager waiting hands.

The delivery was followed by supplies of high carbohydrate and energy 
foods such as crisps, peanuts and Bourbon Creams.

Nearby, a traveller in a distinctive 
white homburg was holding court with reporters. 'Don’t give them your 
name, Eamonn,' a woman shouted from behind.

One traveller who gave his 
name as Michael added: 'We have got to take a stand. If we don’t, this 
will just carry on with other traveller communities.'

Other families 
complained they had nowhere else to go – an argument weakened by the 
discovery that some have luxury homes back in Ireland.

Their resistance, which has received 
support from the UN, Vanessa Redgrave and the Bishop of Chelmsford, is 
in defiance of officials who insist they are breaking the law.

A woman dressed as a witch took up position with a walkie-talkie to a lookout platform on the ramparts.

'They’re coming!' someone shouted, 
and all eyes turned towards a cluster of hard-hatted bailiffs being 
escorted by police towards the blocked gate.

Protesters filled flour 
bombs and distributed missiles as they advanced, pageant-like, up the 
main approach.

From here, the platoon leader 
expressed health and safety concerns about the barricade, straining now 
under the weight of opposing forces.

A sign on the outside said a woman 
had secured herself to the gate by a noose – and warned that if it was 
forced open, she would be killed. Shouts of ‘racists’ drowned out most 
of the bailiff’s remaining words, and cheers accompanied his retreat.

Had his megaphone been working, the 
travellers might have heard him saying something about trying to resolve
the stand-off swiftly and peacefully. Neither outcome looked
likely.
