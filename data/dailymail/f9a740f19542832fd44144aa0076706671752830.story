These spectacular images of star-filled night skies look as though they were taken in the depths of space.

But the awe-inspiring shots are actually the work of Matt Payne, who took the images in Oregon and Colorado.

Mr Payne says people who live in cities often refuse to believe his pictures are real because they have never seen so many stars with their own eyes.

These images, which look like they have been shot from space or through the Hubble Telescope, were actually taken by one 35-year-old man and his camera

Matt Payne specializes in nighttime photography, and took these incredible pictures in Colorado and Oregon, where he grew up and where he now lives

A sky full of stars: Mr Payne, from Portland, says people who live in cities often view his images with disbelief as they have never seen so many stars with their own eyes

The photographer, originally from Colorado but now living in Portland, Oregon, said he enjoys being out in the wild and has always been drawn to the world above.

The 35-year-old, who has been taking night sky photographs for five years, says his work takes meticulous planning as the weather, terrain, time of year and even moon cycle all play a part in the quality of shot he is able to capture.

He said: 'I love nighttime photography - it allows a type of creativity not found in other landscape photography scenes.

'It requires a lot of of patience and planning as well as intimate knowledge of your camera.  

Born to be wild: The photographer says he has always enjoyed the great outdoors, and that he has been drawn to the world above from a very young age

Mr Payne says the key skills needed to take spectacular nighttime shots like these are having a lot of patience and an 'intimate knowledge of your camera'

The weather, terrain, time of year and even moon cycle all play a part in the quality of shot Mr Payne is able to capture, meaning his nights in the wild can be very long

The skilled snapper says he prefers nighttime shots to any other kind of landscape photography because it allows 'a type of creativity' not seen elsewhere

'People with an appreciation and connection to the outdoors and the wilderness who have seen the Milky Way with their own eyes are usually quite connected with my photographs.

'Others, who maybe have not had the opportunity to see the night sky away from the city, are often left in disbelief.

Mr Payne is now planning to shoot the skies over South America, Alaska and northern Europe.

He added: 'I hope my photographs connect people to the fascination and wonder so inherent to the relationship between our Earth and the cosmos.'

Unreal: People who have seen the Milky Way or who are into astronomy have a greater appreciation and connection with these type of images, Mr Payne says

The sheer number of stars on show in one moment leads many people who live in urban areas to not believe Mr Payne's work is real - but it is the genuine article

The photographer's next shoots are planned for Alaska, northern Europe and South America, where he hopes to take more pictures like his these
