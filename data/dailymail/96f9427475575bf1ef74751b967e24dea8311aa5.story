Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo have held talks with French coach Loic Courteau about him joining the former Wimbledon champion’s team next year.

The 50-year-old well-respected Frenchman is seen as having the credentials to add a wealth of experience to Murray’s staff after the departures this year of eight-time Grand Slam winner Ivan Lendl and long-term coach and friend Dani Vallverdu.

Courteau is a former coach and still a confidant of Mauresmo and helped guide the French two-time major winner to world No 1 in her own illustrious career.

Courteau is currently coaching another Frenchman, the world No 25 Julien Benneteau, and has nurtured him to an Indian summer in his career.

But he is said to be open to the idea of teaming up with Murray in 2015. 

Murray started working with Frenchwoman Mauresmo ahead of Wimbledon in June 2014

Benneteau is 33 and, while Courteau is committed to working with him at next month’s Australian Open, it is possible he could be persuaded to switch to Team Murray after that.

Such a move would further entrench world No 6 Murray’s relationship with coach Mauresmo.

The 27-year-old Scot’s support group is currently looking somewhat depleted after Venezuelan Vallverdu left to coach Murray’s Czech rival Tomas Berdych and his long-term fitness trainer and good friend Jez Green also departed for pastures new.
