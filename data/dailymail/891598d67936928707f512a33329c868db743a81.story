We are hooked on perfection - and it is the Big Four supermarkets that tricked us into addiction. My blood boiled this week when Tesco executive Matt Simister claimed fussy shoppers were forcing food suppliers to throw away millions of tons of blemished fruit and veg.

That is sheer hypocrisy and highly manipulative. If the public are not buying less-than-perfect produce, it is because we have been trained for decades to reject it.

Generations of shoppers have been hoodwinked into believing food can not taste right unless it is an ideal shape and colour.

Fussy eaters: shoppers have been hoodwinked into believing food can not taste right unless it is an ideal shape and colour

If anything, the opposite is true: by forcing fruit and veg to match a fantasy image, growers are breeding all the flavour and aroma out of the produce, often leaving us with good-looking pap that tastes of nothing.

It is driven by the cult of supermarkets. Where once we had a mass of small retailers, with busy green-grocers on every High Street in the land, now we have four supermassive conglomerates - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.

Between them, they account for more than 80 per cent of the fruit and veg sold in Britain. The problem has been growing since the Sixties, and now it is out of control: all they care about is their profit margin and the dividend they pay to shareholders.

Whatever their adverts tell you, do not believe for even a minute that the superstores care about us. To them, the public are simply the people who make them rich.

And the casualties are colossal. They create waste at every stage, and we all pay for that: it is madness to throw away up to three-quarters of the food this country produces.

Yet that is what is happening: farmers dump half their food because it does not meet the arbitrary standards of supermarket buyers, and then consumers chuck away half of what they buy - because it does not last as long or taste as good as they'd expected.

Some of the wastage beggars belief. During last summer's cherry glut, I visited an orchard where the pickers were boxing up tonnes of the fruit but setting aside all those that had been deemed to be the wrong shade of red.

Still taste good: But would you buy these misshapen carrots?

You might think a cherry is a cherry, but no; if the colour does not match the supermarket's stipulated hue, they will be rejected.

At best, the unwanted fruit will go to food processors to be made into jam or pie fillings, or be sold at wholesale markets where standards are not so exacting. Sadly, most of the fruit will be dumped: it might be delicious but it is useless.

A farmer in Lancashire who grows cauliflowers told me this year that a burst of sunshine at the wrong time can be disastrous for his crop.

In the warm weather, the white hearts of his caulis  turn slightly yellow, and that is all it takes for his vegetables to fail the supermarket  buyer’s test.

He will have to plough the whole crop back into the ground - good for nothing but fertiliser. If that sounds crazy, you will not believe  the problems forced on  egg producers.

Any egg that is slightly too large has to be rejected. You would think they could be marketed as 'extra value eggs' - get more for your money!

One producer told me that for several weeks each year, his hens lay eggs that are a darker shade of brown than usual. Until the colour goes back to normal, he has to shut up shop: the supermarkets do not want them.

Search for perfection: Food is being wasted as a result

I refuse to believe there is a single shopper anywhere in Britain who has strong views about how brown an eggshell should be.

Part of the problem is that the supermarket buyers are far from being experts. They are novices, constantly rotated between different departments. This year's apple buyer might have been in charge of loo roll procurement last year.

That means they have no specialist knowledge, no close relationship with the farmers, and no passion for any particular product.

What they do have is a quarterly target. They know exactly how much produce their department will have  to shift if they are to keep their jobs.

To give themselves the best possible chance of hitting their targets, they will be ruthless about buying only the produce that customers are proven to buy: the fruit and veg that looks perfect.

The French and the Italians think we are insane. When they go shopping, they pick up their fruit and inhale the aroma. They do everything but bite into it - they want to know it is going to taste as good as possible.

British supermarkets hate us to touch the fruit. We might scratch it or bruise it. That is why so much on the fresh counter is wrapped in plastic.

The packaging projects a subliminal message: smell does not matter, flavour does not matter ... looks are everything.

To intensify the message, we are bombarded with 'food porn', pictures of glistening fruit and veg that is unnaturally perfect.

Looks are everything: This carrot wouldn't make it on to many supermarket shelves

Instead of tempting us to try delicious flavours, we are being taught to desire food that looks like it is made  of wax.

The advertising teams know it is easier to persuade us to desire shiny gleaming things than to educate us about real food. People do not naturally go for knobbly fruit and veg, especially when it carries negative labels like 'misshapen'.

Every now and then the supermarkets go through the motions of stocking imperfect produce. They label it 'wonky' or 'ugly', words to inspire us to shop out of pity . . . and when we do not buy it, they blame us. If we protest, they blame Europe. There have certainly been plenty of mad diktats from the EU about how fruit should look, but most were scrapped in 2009.

If they wanted to, the Big Four could have us queuing up to buy misshapen produce. They have talked us into buying chickens bulked up with water and steak pies bolstered with horse meat - how hard can it be for them to sell an undersized mango?

For example, they could offer packs of winter vegetables with a recipe for soup on the wrapper. All carrots look alike once they are chopped and in the saucepan.

Or they could sell bags of discoloured, but succulent, strawberries with the slogan 'Ideal for jam!'

That way, we'd all win. Farmers would sell more, less food would be wasted, and prices would come down.

But some serious re-education is needed. It could take five years for a new generation to be taught that food tastes better if it does not look  like plastic.

However, the supermarkets display almost no interest in education - and there is another problem.

It takes oceans of pesticide, fungicide and fertiliser to grow unblemished fruit. Every insect that might dare nibble a leaf or bore a hole has to be sprayed out of existence.

The irony is that a lettuce that has been chomped by a caterpillar cannot do you any harm - but the damage to the countryside from pesticide sprays is widespread.

These chemical products make billions for manufacturers, and the chemical giants that develop and market them are powerful.

They have a vested interest in making sure Britain does not get the urge to go organic and start eating wonky carrots and knobbly apples.

For them, the bottom line is money. But for the shoppers, it is much worse: the bottom line is that we are being tricked into eating flavourless, chemical-sodden fruit and vegetables . . . and paying extra for the privilege.
