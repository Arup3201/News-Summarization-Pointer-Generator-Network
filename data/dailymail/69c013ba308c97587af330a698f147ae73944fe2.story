In the film Labor Day, Kate Winslet plays a woman who falls in love with a violent escaped criminal with a penchant for peach pie and a heart of gold.

But while it might sound romantic, the reality, as Women Who Love Men Who Kill author Sheila Isenberg points out, is quite different.

'These women are looking for romance with a capital R
 and all its ups and downs and thrills and excitement,' she explains.

Life's work: Author Sheila Isenberg has spent years interviewing women who fall for convicted prisoners

'They get this 
when they get involved with a convicted murderer because he’s behind 
bars and the entire situation is fraught with uncertainty, doubt and 
danger and therefore, excitement and romance.

'The 
love is not real but delusional love - it’s not the companionable love 
that a healthy person seeks but a 
stage one, always exciting, romance.'

But the consequences can be appalling, with many abandoning families while more still end up behind bars themselves.

Among them is Toby Young, now 54, from Kansas, whose happy family life was ripped apart after she fell in love with convicted murderer John 'Hooligan' Manard, now 33.

'She decided to take a risk and rescue 
dogs and prisoners at the same time by founding Safe Harbor Prison Dogs 
in Kansas City in August 2004,' says Isenberg, who interviewed Young for her book.

Home: Both halves of the couple had spent most of their lives in Kansas City or in the local correctional facility

'The men’s prison at Lansing gave her 
security clearance so she could move her mutts in and out and she worked 
with prisoners who had good records, helping them train dogs.

'The 
programme was so successful that, within 18 months, 800 dogs had been 
trained and adopted by Kansas families.'

But unbeknown to prison authorities, Young who was married with two grown-up sons, had grown close to Manard and just a year after the affair began, decided to run away with him.

On the morning of 12th February 2006, she arrived at the prison driving her white van as normal. But when the van drove out a couple of hours later, it was carrying an extra passenger - Manard, concealed in one of the dog crates in the back.

Speaking two years after the escape, Young said that everything she did was coloured by the depression she was suffering, caused by the loss of a child 20 years previously.

'He was just someone I could really talk to,' she told a local TV channel. 'We could talk about anything. He was smart. I was very unhappy, and I was so depressed.'

Remote: The couple drove 700 miles to a hidden log cabin near Chattanooga in Tennessee

Entertainment: Manard spent his days watching convict film O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Carrying an overnight bag containing $25,000 
in cash, two of her husband’s 
semi-automatic pistols, black hair dye, a razor, books, videos, puzzles and sex 
toys, she and Manard drove 700 miles into Tennessee where a remote log cabin awaited them.

'In Alpine,
 Tennessee, the couple settled into a life of domesticity as well as 
sexual experimentation,' explains Isenberg.

'Manard played music from the jailbreak film O 
Brother, Where Art Thou? and tried to make new identity papers.

'He
 watched porn DVDs and used a PlayStation while Young did puzzles, read
 pop fiction, and wrote in her journal. Sometimes she dressed up, and 
the couple experimented with whips and sex toys.'

But less than three weeks after they escaped, the couple's log cabin was surrounded by police and the two were arrested.

Manard had 10 years added to his already lengthy sentence.

Young was given 15 months and was eventually released in May 2008, returning home to be handed a divorce by her husband and attempt to rebuild her relationship with her sons.

'Some days it took all my energy not to break apart a razor and cut my wrists in my room,' she told KMBC ahead of her release.

'The women [who have relationships with prisoners] are emotionally damaged but probably no more than most of us,' comments Isenberg.

'They are looking for a partner who makes them feel whole, which is kind of what all of us do, although I would hope that a healthier person would seek someone who could live a real life in the real world.

'A relationship with a man in prison is not real in that its parameters are controlled by the prison rules and the prison walls - it’s not the real world.'

And yet despite the risks and the unreality, women like Young and like Kate Winslet's Labor Day character Adele Wheeler continue to pursue relationships with convicts.

'One that stands out is a woman who was a
 juror on a murder trial,' says Isenberg. 'She helped convict a man and then after visiting him in prison, she fell for him, left her husband and children, 
job and extended family, and moved to live near the prison.

Damaged: Like Labor Day's Adele Wheeler, many of the women Isenberg interviewed were damaged

'Another 
story that shocked me was a young woman who 
fell in love with her grandmother’s murderer.'

So why do these doomed romances continue to happen? Isenberg has several theories but says one standout similarity is that nearly all of the women involved were abuse victims, whether in previous relationships or during childhood.

'My theory is that for them, relationships with convicted murderers behind bars are "safe",' she explains.

'The men in prison can't hurt these women who have been so abused and therein lies their appeal, or at least part of it.

'Also, men in prison for life have a lot 
of time on their hands and can devote many, many hours to these 
relationships,' she adds.

'They write long love letters, love poems, paint pictures and so on, showering the women with the kind of romantic attention that just is
 not that common outside prison walls.'

Attention that damaged women such as Toby Young and Labor Day's Adele Wheeler just can't resist - whoever it comes from.
