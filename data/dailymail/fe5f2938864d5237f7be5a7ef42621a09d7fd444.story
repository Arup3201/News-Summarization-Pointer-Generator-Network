Scrawled images of Mr Spock have started appearing on Canadian $5 bills, with Star Trek fans defacing the former prime minster in honor of actor Leonard Nimoy.

The act of giving Sir Wilfrid Laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - Spock's pointy Vulcan ears, sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new.

But following the death of 83-year-old Nimoy last week from lung cancer, amateur artists have been out in force, even triggering a reaction from the national bank.

Tribute: Scrawled images of Mr Spock have started appearing on Canadian $5 bills, with Star Trek fans defacing the former prime minster in honor of actor Leonard Nimoy.

Long-running tradition: The act of giving Sir Wilfrid Laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - Spock's pointy Vulcan ears, sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new

A spokeswoman from the central reserve, Josianne Menard, said Tuesday that scribbling on the blue bills is inappropriate because it defaces a symbol and source of national pride.

Menard warned defaced bills may not circulate for as long and risk being rejected by retailers.

'There are important reasons why it should not be done,' she noted.

However, Canada's central bank confirmed this week that it is not illegal to deface or even mutilate banknotes.

Following Nimoy's death Friday, social media users posted their own versions of Sir Laurier's Vulcan makeover to honor the actor.

'Spock your $5 bills for Leonard Nimoy,' a group called the Canadian Design Resource tweeted alongside its depiction.

Images of the altered bills circulated widely online and attracted international media attention to something many Canadians had never seen before - although for others, it was hardly a new frontier.

Calgary artist Tom Bagley, who posted his own Spock-Laurier hybrid on Facebook and Flickr after Nimoy's death, described it as a traditional bar trick to impress the waitress.

'I always thought it was OK as long as the numbers were intact - it still counted as money,' he said. 

'That's what I heard. Because stuff happens, like say you spill spaghetti sauce all over it or something like that.'

'Spocking Fives' even has its own identity on Facebook,  where Canadians are encouraged to post their revision of Sir Laurier’s face.

A description accompanying the page - founded in 2008 - states:  'The origins of this mysterious tradition are shrouded in secrecy, although it is widely believed to be totally awesome.'
