Indonesian investigators say they have found no evidence so far that terrorism played a
part in the crash of an AirAsia passenger jet last
month that killed all 162 people on board.

Andreas Hananto said his team of 10 investigators at the National Transportation Safety Committee
(NTSC) had found 'no threats' in the cockpit voice recordings to
indicate foul play during AirAsia Flight QZ8501.

The Airbus A320-200 vanished from radar screens on
December 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from
Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya to Singapore.

Indonesian investigators say they have found no evidence from the black box recording so far that terrorism played apart in the crash of an AirAsia passenger jet on December 28 that killed all 162 people on board

When asked if there was any evidence from the recording that
terrorism was involved, Hananto said: 'No. Because if there were
terrorism, there would have been a threat of some kind.'

'In that critical situation, the recording indicates that
the pilot was busy with the handling of the plane.'

Investigators said they had listened to the whole of the
recording but transcribed only about half.

'We didn't hear any voice of other persons other than the
pilots,' another investigator, Nurcahyo Utomo, said. 

'We didn't
hear any sounds of gunfire or explosions. For the time being,
based on that, we can eliminate the possibility of terrorism.'

Investigators can hear 'almost everything' on the recording contained in one of the flight's two black boxes retrieved last week from the Java Sea

Mr Utomo said that investigators could hear 'almost everything'
on the recording contained in one of the flight's two 'black
boxes'. 

The other is the flight data recorder, and both have
been recovered from the wreckage at the bottom of the Java Sea.

He declined to give details about what was said during the
doomed flight's final moments, citing Indonesian law.

Indonesian authorities have said that bad weather was likely
to have played a part in the disaster.

According to Mr Hananto, evidence also showed that an explosion
was unlikely before the plane crashed, disputing a theory
suggested by an official from the National Search and Rescue
Agency last week.

'From the (flight data recordings) so far, it's unlikely
there was an explosion,' Mr Hananto said. 

'If there was, we would
definitely know because certain parameters would show it. There
are something like 1,200 parameters.'

The first half of the two-hour long cockpit voice recordings from the black box has been transcribed

The final minutes of the AirAsia flight were full of 'sounds
of machines and sounds of warnings' that must be filtered out to
get a complete transcript of what was said in the cockpit, according to Mr Hananto, who has been an air safety investigator since 2009.

The first half of the two-hour long cockpit voice recording
has been transcribed. That includes audio from the previous
flight and the beginning of Flight QZ8501, which crashed around
40 minutes after takeoff.

The team, which is working with French, Singaporean and
Chinese air safety investigators, hopes to finish transcribing
the recording this week.

With seven computers and various audio equipment, the small
NTSC laboratory dedicated to the AirAsia investigation is split
into two rooms; one for the cockpit voice recorder and the other
for the flight data recorder.

Analysis of the flight data recorder will take longer because investigators are examining all 72
previous flights flown by the aircraft.

Investigators hope to finish a preliminary report on the
crash early next week. The full report could take up to a year,
but will not include the entire cockpit voice transcript.

'In Indonesia it remains undisclosed,' Tatang Kurniadi,
chief of the NTSC, said. 'Just some important highlights will be
included in the report.'
