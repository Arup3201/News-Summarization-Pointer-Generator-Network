Lukas Podolski wants to discuss his future at Arsenal with manager Arsene Wenger after being left on the bench again during the Gunners' 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United.

The 29-year-old has started just one Premier League game so far this season, with the north London side enduring their worst start to a league campaign in 32 years.

Wenger's men already find themselves 15 points behind the leaders Chelsea and lie in eighth place in the Premier League after just three wins.

Podolski told German publication Kicker: 'I have to try to talk with Arsene Wenger. I want a fair chance.

'I love London, I like the club, but I do not like the situation. I'm not a clown.'

Despite Arsenal's on-field problems the German was all smiles as he enjoyed a day out at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park on Sunday, even managing to joke about his current situation.

The out-of-favour forward posted a picture of himself at the attraction on Twitter with the message: 'Enjoyed my rainy Sunday afternoon at Winter Wonderland with the family' #hydepark #gunnersumbrella #familytime #dayout #EnjoyLife #Poldi #BreakFromTheBench

With Olivier Giroud returning from his injury lay-off earlier than expected, Podolski's first-team opportunities are unlikely to improve any time soon.

The former Bayern Munich striker has made his feelings clear that he is not prepared to sit on the bench for much longer, refusing to rule out a move away from the Gunners in the upcoming January transfer window. 

Next up for Wenger's men is a Champions League match-up against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night, with a point guaranteeing Arsenal's pathway through to the last 16 stage.
