The average American is 20 pounds heavier today then they were in the 1990s, a new report shows.

The poll by annual Gallup Health and Healthcare Survey found that American men, on average, say they weigh 196 pounds and women say they weigh 160 pounds.

Both figures are nearly 20 pounds higher than the average that men and women reported 20 years ago.

As Americans' actual weight has increased, so has their ideal weight.

For men, it is now 181 pounds (up from 177 pounds), and for women, it is now 138 pounds (up from 137), according to the report.

Researchers say this means that not only do men and women report that they weigh more today versus 20 years ago, but they are also getting further away from their ideal weight.

Comparing the self-reports of actual and ideal weights, the average man weighs 15 pounds more than his ideal today, compared with nine pounds in 1990.

The average woman weighs 22 pounds more than her ideal today, compared with 13 pounds in 1990.

The current figures for men and women are the highest Gallup has measured to date.

Getting fatter: The poll found that American men, on average, say they weigh 196 pounds - nearly 20 pounds heavier than reported in 1990

These results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey, conducted Nov. 3-6.

Gallup has asked Americans to say how much they weigh yearly since 2001 and in 1990 and 1999.

The survey concluded that 64 per cent of men and 68 per cent of women in America are currently over their ideal weight.

In a separate daily polling, Gallup and 
Healthways track Americans' found that 62 per cent of Americans were 
either overweight or obese in the third quarter of this year.

However, this figure far exceeds the percentage of Americans who personally describe themselves as overweight - just 39 per cent - with the majority (56 per cent)Â  saying their weight is 'about right,' as previous polls in the past 20 years have also shown.

Researchers say the disconnect between the percentage who are over their ideal weight and the percentage who say they are overweight may come from Americans' own reluctance to describe themselves using such a term.

Additionally, Gallup's data found that roughly one in four Americans are between one and 10 pounds over their ideal weight, many of whom may be more inclined to view their weight as 'about right' than as 'overweight'.

Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted between November 3 and 6 with a random sample of 1,012 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all U.S. states, selected using random sampling.
