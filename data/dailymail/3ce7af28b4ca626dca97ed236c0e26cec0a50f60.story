What was life like for Catherine Greig, the long suffering girlfriend of mob boss Whitey Bulger?

Before her arrest last week after 16 years on the run with Bulger, the 60-year-old had been by his side for more than three decades.

She had seemingly turned a blind eye to his criminal career, in which he allegedly killed 19 people, two of whom may have been her own brothers-in-law.

She also put up with the gangster's 
famous fiery temper not to mention an odd jealousy he harboured for her 
beloved toy poodles.

As
if that wasn't enough Bulger was also leading a double life with her 
and his previous long-term girlfriend Teresa Stanley, alternating 
between the houses he shared with both women.

Neighbours of the couple, who ended up in a modest apartment in Santa Monica, said Greig had been friendly, but guarded.

One,
Janus Goodwin, claimed Greig had recently confided over coffee that she
thought Bulger may be suffering from dementia, according to the New 
York Times.

Ms Goodwin had tried to offer support but it was rebuffed.

'I’d say, "Why don’t we do this, why don’t I do that?" And she said to me, "I can’t really make any new friends".'

Ms Goodwin also noticed the alleged gangster's temper and how Greig dealt with it.

'When he called out to her, 
she acted as if he did this wonderful thing and God had called to her,' she said.

Thomas Rudolph, who had known 
the couple in Louisiana, told the Boston Globe in 1998 that Bulger 
thought 'women should be seen and not heard.'

He added Bulger had boasted that all need do was clap his hands and Greig would jump.

Greig, now 60, was well versed in mobster life when she met Bulger. She had married Bobby McGonagle, a Boston firefighter with close family ties to the Irish mafia, in her early twenties.

Extreme violence and shootings were a regular occurrence in the South Boston neighbourhood where the couple lived.

McGonagle was wounded during a shootout in 1969, while one of his brothers was killed the same year. Another in 1974.

He blamed Bulger, who was a member of a rival gang. McGonagle and Greig were divorced a few years later only for her to become embroiled with Bulger - 20 years her senior.

If she could overlook his alleged involvement in the deaths of her brothers-in-law perhaps she could turn a blind eye to other things.

Fugitives: Bulger, seen left in a courtroom drawing, appeared almost jovial during a hearing last week, in contrast Greig, right, was timid

The FBI was onto Bulger even before he disappeared from the Boston house that Greig bought for $160,000 cash in 1986 and still owns, according to reports.

In one recording, taken from bugs the bureau laid in the couple's home, Bulger can be heard screaming that Greig cared more about her poodles than she did for him.

Bulger left Boston in 1994 with his previous moll Teresa Stanley. But after being tipped off by a crooked FBI agent that he was about to be charged in a major racketeering indictment a year later, the gangster sped back to Boston.

He dumped Stanley in a parking lot, according to book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the F.B.I. and the Irish Mob, saying: 'I'll call you.'

Friendly: Neighbours of the couple in Santa Monica described Greig as impeccably turned out, friendly yet guarded

She never heard from him again.

He then picked up Greig and they fled into rural America. Her poodles were left behind.

There they led a life of deception. They used aliases when renting apartments and paid cash for everything.

Greig underwent multiple plastic surgeries, including breast implants, a facelift and nose job, according to the FBI.

But she also liked to keep up appearances. The bureau said she had her teeth cleaned once a month and regularly got her hair dyed in salons.

In Grand Isle, Louisiana she even visited a salon owned by a police chief’s 
daughter.

After her arrest her Santa Monica neighbours told reporters she was 
always impeccably dressed with manicured nails; she had let her hair go white, but it was always set.

Greig had been friendly, but had never been allowed to get too close to anyone.

Even in court last week she seemed timid in contrast to Bulger's almost jovial stance.

She glanced over to her lawyer when asked questions and seemed nervous, only smiling for her twin sister Margaret McCusker, who was in the front row.

Greig is charged with harbouring a fugitive and faces five years in prison, while Bulger, is charged with 19 murders, extortion, money laundering
and other crimes.

If convicted, he faces life in prison or the death 
penalty.
