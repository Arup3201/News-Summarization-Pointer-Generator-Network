Since the 1930s, car makers have experimented with a host of features to give their models a unique selling point.

Yet some were so weird, and in some cases, dangerous that they never really took off.

This included glovebox minibars that kept tumblers in place using magnets, a steering wheel with a spike that could impale the driver, record players built into the dashboard and a sack that carried dogs alongside the vehicle.

This magnetic minibar was a standard feature of the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. It featured a magnetised glovebox door and a set of four metal shot tumblers that were designed to stay put when turning corners and prevent drinks being spilt

The 1956-1959 Chryslers were fitted with a record player. The records didn't last very long because the stylus was designed to press down on them hard to prevent skipping, which damaged the vinyl and didn't always stop the tracks from skipping anyway

This collection of bizarre car inventions was put together by car fanatics site Jalopnik.

The magnetic minibar was a standard feature of the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham.

Limousines of the time were fitted with bars but the Eldorado Brougham was the first car to have one built-in.

It featured a magnetised glovebox door and a set of four metal shot tumblers that were designed to stay put when turning corners.

Many of the Chryslers produced between 1956 and 1959 were fitted with a record player.

The records didn't last very long because the stylus was designed to press down on them hard to prevent skipping, which damaged the vinyl.

According to car fan Michael Ballaban, the players used in the Chryslers only played specially designed records, which meant that there wasn't a huge catalogue of albums to choose from.

He also said that even with the pressure from the stylus, the tracks would still skip if the car went around a corner or over a pothole.

The Dog Sack, pictured, first appeared in the June 1935 issue of Popular Mechanics. It was designed to keep your car clean and give your dog some fresh air. The sack was clamped to the car's running board and hooks were attached to the window

The Dog Sack invention first appeared in the June 1935 issue of Popular Mechanics.

It was designed to keep the car clean while giving the dog some fresh air.

According
 to the original article: 'When you take your dog along for a ride, but 
prefer not having it inside the car, it can ride safely and comfortably 
in this sack, which is carried on the running board.

'The
 bottom of the sack is clamped to the running board and the top is 
fastened to the lower part of an open window with hooks, covered with 
small rubber tubing to prevent marking the car.'

This invention was never added to any car models.

During the late 70s and early 1980s, car manufacturers tried to get more people to wear their seatbelts by introducing automatic versions, pictured. The lap belt would clip on like the modern-day belts and the shoulder belt would be built into a track in the top of the door frame and across the driver

During the late 1970s and early 
1980s, car manufacturers tried to get more people to wear their 
seatbelts by introducing automatic versions.

They
 came in two models; a combination manual lap belt and automated 
shoulder belt - the lap belt would clip on like the modern-day belts and
 the shoulder belt would be built into a track in the top of the door 
frame and across the driver.

The
 other involved the driver having to slide under the belt to get into 
and out of the car and the belt would then strap across their body.

The belt would lock the driver in position which made driving dangerous.

The Reliant Robin, pictured, is a small three-wheeled car that was made by the Reliant Motor Company. It was given three wheels to make it cheaper to tax than normal cars. During a Top Gear episode from 2007, the presenters showed how easy it was to roll the car over when turning corners

The Reliant Robin is a small three-wheeled car that was made by the Reliant Motor Company in Tamworth.

It was given three wheels to make it cheaper to tax and put it in a different licensing category than normal cars.

During a Top Gear episode from 2007 the presenters showed how easy it was to roll the car over when turning corners.

Despite the way it looked and how dangerous it could be, the cars sold on and off from 1973 until 2002.

The
 1954 Cadillac Eldorado was fitted with the so-called Bullet Wheel, also
 known as the Steering Wheel of Death because it featured a 
bullet-shaped spike that could impale the driver.

This wheel was blamed for the loss of singer Sammy Davis, Jr.'s eye after he had an accident and his face hit the wheel

This wheel was blamed for the loss of singer Sammy Davis, Jr.'s eye after he had an accident in 1954 and his face hit the wheel.

Cars during the 1950s were fitted with automatic dimming headlights called Twilight Sentinel.

It was designed to sense outside light using an electric photocell in the dashboard and turn the exterior lights on and off depending on lighting conditions.

A timer could also be set that delayed shutting off the headlights for a set period of time.

Twilight Sentinel was first offered on the 
1959 Cadillac Series 62. It was later added to select 
Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Chevrolet models.

Cars during the 1950s were fitted with automatic dimming headlights called Twilight Sentinel, such as the 1959 Cadillac Series 62, pictured. It was designed to sense outside light and turn the exterior lights on and off depending on the lighting condition. However, it was temperamental and would switch on and off sporadically

Cadillac later referred to its automatic
 dimming system as 'Guidematic Headlamp Control'.

The
 problem with the automatic dimming headlights was that they didn't not 
automatically turn off if the driver manually turned the headlights on 
to begin with, nor did it turn on the exterior lights for driving 
conditions such as heavy rain or fog.

This meant oncoming drivers could be temporarily blinded by strong beams, and sometimes the lights didn't change in different weather conditions.
