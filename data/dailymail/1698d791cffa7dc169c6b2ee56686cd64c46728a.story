They are the men you can depend on, the influential players who are always involved and usually deliver the goods whatever the situation in the match.

An Opta analysis of the Premier League season to date has revealed that Aston Villa's Andreas Weimann is the player who is involved in the highest proportion of his team's goals.

With three goals and two assists this campaign, the Austrian striker has been involved in 71.4 per cent of Villa's goals.

Despite playing a part in five of Villa's seven goals this season, Weimann could do with scoring some more

Admittedly, they have only scored seven goals so far but this statistic shows his vital importance to their cause.

Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea is second in the ranking, as his two goals and eight assists mean he has played a hand in 58.8 per cent of his team's goals this term.

QPR's Charlie Austin - seven goals and one assist - has been involved in 57.1 per cent of their goals, while Saido Berahino has scored over half of West Brom's.

Manchester City have scored 27 league goals so far and their talisman Sergio Aguero has played a hand in 14 of them (51.9 per cent) - a very impressive return.

And the value of Alexis Sanchez to Arsenal is underlined by his involvement in 10 of their 21 Premier League goals so far this season.

Louis van Gaal will be satisfied that Â£60m signing Angel di Maria has played a part in over 40 per cent of Manchester United's goals this campaign.

Jose Mourinho can be happy with his summer acquisitions too - both Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas have been involved in 36.7 per cent of Chelsea's goals.
