Ed Miliband always looks startled because he has ‘got big eyes’ which affects whether voters see him as Prime Minister, Labour heavyweight Tom Watson has claimed.

The former minister - who quit as Mr Miliband’s election strategist this summer - also said the Labour leader got it ‘so wrong’ over the Falkirk vote-rigging scandal and struggled to make headlines because he is too clever.

Recent opinion polls show Labour extending its lead over the Tories, but more voters think David Cameron would make a better leader for Britain.

However Mr Watson makes clear that after a faltering start he now believes Mr Miliband 'will be a good Prime Minister'.

'learning on the job' and his main achievement was stopping the Labour 
party tearing itself apart

Mr Miliband has repeatedly been likened to plastercine character Wallace, of Wallace and Gromit fame.

In recent weeks he has made headlines with his promise to freeze energy bills and attacking the government over the cost of living.

But a new ICM poll this week showed only 27 per cent of people think he would make the best Prime Minister, including only 64 per cent of people who backed Labour in 2010.

A separate YouGov survey found just four per cent think he is a 'natural leader' - the same as Nick Clegg.

Now Mr Watson has suggested the way Mr Miliband looks means voters might struggle to imagine him running the country.

Mr Watson was being interviewed by comedian Matt Forde as part of the live theatre comedy show The Political Party, which is recorded as a podcast.

Appearing on stage Mr Watson admitted that the Labour leader often looks startled even when challenging Mr Cameron in the Commons.

‘Well he has got big eyes. That doesn’t help him,’ Mr Watson said.

He went on to suggest that Mr Miliband’s greatest achievement so far was preventing Labour tearing itself apart, but warned the first few years of his leadership were wasted by being too ‘clever’.

Mr Watson said: ‘Did the right Miliband win? Yes, I think the most important challenge for the leader that won was to unify the party and I think Ed was the person who could most do that.’

Asked if he meant Mr Miliband uniting the party behind or against him, Mr Watson replied: ‘That’s a good question.’

He added: ‘The truth is I think it is a miracle he has held it all together.’

Mr Watson, who backed Ed Balls for Labour leader, said that when Mr Miliband won in 2010 ‘I wasn’t sure where he would go’.

He
 added: ‘He was a young leader who wasn’t supposed to win. There were a 
lot of question marks over his leadership. He has done a lot of learning
 on the job.’

Praise: Mr Watson said that at a recent PMQs, Mr Miliband looked like a leader while David Cameron appeared 'old and tired'

Tom Watson was offered a 'staggering' amount of money to take part in Celebrity Big Brother - but turned it down.

Taking questions during the Political Party comedy show, he said he was unsure if he wanted to be a minister again.

An audience member suggested he sign up for Strictly Come Dancing.

Mr Watson replied: 'I was offered a staggering amount of money from someone who said I should be on Celebrity Big Brother.

'I think I would be terrible at all that stuff.'

Another audience member said the Labour heavyweight would be better suited to Great British Bake-Off.

Mr Watson said that at a recent PMQs 
Mr Miliband now looked like a ‘Prime Minister in waiting and David 
Cameron looked old and tired and you wouldn’t have said that a year 
ago.’

‘Yes, I think he will be a good Prime Minister.’

He
 said Mr Miliband had  a ‘particular problem’ facing a coalition, 
because the Tories and Lib Dems were more interesting and he is ‘kind of
 third on the newslists’.

But he said Mr Miliband’s reputation as a policy wonk held Labour back

‘If
 I am being honest because he is so bright and clever and he is such a 
thinker, he has been very good on the strategic stuff but learning to be
 in opposition was a bit of a chore for us.’

He said too many of the Labour leadership had only ever been in government and struggled to make an impression in opposition.

‘For them to act as an opposition and seize issues and make them theirs was quite difficult for us in the early years.’

Mr Watson also turned his fire on the Labour leader over his handling of allegations of vote-rigging in Falkirk.

In the summer he quit as election strategist over claims that he was involved in claims the Unite union signed up people to the Labour party without their knowledge in order to influence candidate selection in Falkirk.

Mr Miliband reported Mr Waton’s office manager Karie Murphy to the police and has since refused to reopen the party inquiry, despite claims witnesses were pressured into changing their stories.

Mr Watson said: ‘It's amazing how my own leader can be so wrong. But he was.

‘It's hard for me to say this, but Ed just got it wrong on Falkirk.

‘He was given information, or a report, that was inaccurate and omitted some key facts, and took judgements that really harmed the individuals involved in a grotesque way.

‘I suspect privately he is a little bit embarrassed about it.’

Mr Watson said he did not know if he would want to be a minister again – or if Mr Miliband would want him.

‘If Labour won the next election, do I want to be a minister, does Ed want me to be a minister? I honestly don’t know.’
