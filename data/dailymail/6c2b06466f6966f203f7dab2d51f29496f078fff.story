For the four Utah men profiled on controversial new TLC reality series 'My Husband's Not Gay', it's possible - if not common - to remain married to a woman despite having sexual feelings for other men.

But a new study has found that relationships involving gay Mormons are two to three times more likely to end in divorce than others.

Researchers surveyed 1,612 LGBT/same-sex attracted members and former members of the Latter Day Saints Church and found that between 51 percent and 69 percent of mixed-orientation marriages end in divorce.

By comparison, only 25 percent of LDS couples that both identify as heterosexual end in divorce, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.

Controversial: A new study has found that Mormon marriages involving a man who is attracted to other men are two to three times more likely to end in divorce than others. Here, Preston and Megan Dahlgren, one of the couple's profiled in My Husband's Not gay, hold their daughter Naomi

The study was spearheaded by John Dehlin, a doctoral student at Utah State University, and Bill Bradshaw, a retired Brigham Young University professor, with help from Renee Galliher, also of USU.

It also found that 70 percent of people who experience SSA - same sex attraction - which the church prefers to gay as a label, would go on to leave the LDS, while 80 percent admitted to undergoing some kind of therapy to change their sexual orientation.

The people who participated in the survey were spread across 48 states, but 45 percent were from Utah, as well as 22 countries.

Some 75 percent were male and 22 percent were female.

Around 7 percent were excommunication from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 25 percent had resigned, 36 percent were inactive, 29 percent were active, and 3 percent had been disfellowshipped.

Kendall Wilcox, the creator of Far Between, a documentary about LGBT Mormons, said the data stacked up.

He also noted the willingness of such Mormons to come forward, because 'they want their story to be known and not repeated; they want vindication for their mistreatment'.

The release of the study coincides with the debut of 'My Husband's Not Gay', which has the support of Mormon leaders but was slammed as irresponsible and dangerous by gay rights advocacy groups. 

'While the church does not promote marriage as a treatment method for same-sex attraction, couples who are trying to be lovingly supportive of each other while being true to their religious convictions deserve our support and respect,' said church spokesman Eric Hawkins.  

The gay rights group GLAAD, however, says the show sends the wrong message and is a sad reminder of so-called gay conversion therapy, often faith-based efforts designed to change sexual orientation that can be emotionally scarring. 

New Jersey and California in 2013 banned therapists from practicing gay conversion therapy on children and teenagers. The American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association do not support the therapy. 

As pro-gay groups like GLAAD vent outrage over the show's premise, the LDS Church has spoken out in support of the unlikely TV stars

'No one can change who they love, and, more importantly, no one should have to,' GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. 'By investing in this dangerous programming, TLC is putting countless young LGBT people in harm's way.'

The organization pointed to a change.org petition asking TLC to cancel the show that so far has gathered more than 80,000 signatures. Responding to GLAAD, the network says it will tell compelling stories about different ways of life, and the four men on the hourlong show speak only for themselves.

Jeff Bennion, 44, met his wife, Tanya, more than 13 years ago after he had dated men. He told her he was attracted to men after they'd been dating for about a year and a half.

'I was devastated because I didn't know what that meant for me,' said Tanya Bennion, 42. She worried that he'd cheat on her with a friend but said the couple's strong connection helped her work through her questions.

Megan Dahlgren says her marriage remains strong, including the physical aspects of their relationship.  'We do have a happy, healthy sex life,' she said.

Dahlgren and Bennion both said their upbringing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was a big part of why they wanted to remain in a husband-and-wife relationship. 

'I would say it was part of my decision early on, especially, and a big influencer of that,' Dahlgren said. 'It certainly helped guide me toward where I'm at today, no doubt about it.'

'My Husband's Not Gay' is not the only show about people from Utah in unusual marriages. TLC also airs the shows 'Sister Wives' and 'My Five Wives' about polygamous unions

Jeff Bennion said he would be horrified if a parent told a gay child that they should be more like one of the men on the show.

'That's not anything that I would support or agree with,' he said.

But Bennion said that he's happy with his wife and their 6-year-old son. 'I can't believe how lucky I am,' he said.
