With a rise in social media and technology, the quest for love has been taken to a whole new level.

And now, research reveals that women are the ones putting themselves back in the
dating driving seat, sending a staggering 45 per cent more messages 
than their male counterparts.

According to the results, it would seem the girls of Gloucester aren’t short of potential Mr. Rights to message, sending an average of 85 flirty messages.

Women are the keenest texters sending a staggering 45 per cent more messages than their male counterparts

But the men of Gloucester are much more lazy when it comes to love, lagged behind and sending only 35 messages.

Meanwhile, the shy and retiring heartbreakers of Harrow proved to be more disinterested when it came to finding a date, sending only 14 messages on average.

The research, by FlirtFinder, exposed the nation’s keenest flirts, ruthless in their quest to find the perfect date with the top areas of pro-active daters sending four times the amount of messages than less playful areas.

The most avid of daters hail from Gloucester, Derby and Hereford whilst the laziest come from Harrow, Salisbury and Torquay.

Justin Battell, managing director of FlirtFinder said: Our most prolific dater has sent over 11,700 messages and our top 100 members have sent over 560,000 messages between them.

'These top daters tend to be serial daters who aren’t looking to sacrifice their single life and would rather have a series of casual flings than a serious relationship.

'These frisky daters tend to never leave the service and have usually been members for between two to four years.'
