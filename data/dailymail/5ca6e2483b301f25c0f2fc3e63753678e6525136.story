Four men have been taken in custody after the severely bruised body of 46-year-old Diedra Crawford was discovered in Dearborn Heights on Monday.

Ms Crawford's body was found at around 1am on Monday night, Dearborn Heights Police Chief Lee Gavin said. 

'The area that the body was left in is an area where you can obviously see there are no homes right across the street and on the other side of the street there is a dark backyard,'  Lt. James Serwatowski of Dearborn Heights police told WDIV Detroit.

Wilkie said investigators believe Ms Crawford was killed in Westland and that more people may be involved.

The woman had no identification on her but was identified through fingerprints.
