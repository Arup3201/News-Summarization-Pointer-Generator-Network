Catching a good film, dinner at a nice restaurant and maybe a bunch of flowers is what most people can expect on a first date.

But now hopeless romantics wanting to make a real impression can woo their potential partner on the world's most expensive date - as long as they have a spare £34,000.

Private island Spitbank Fort, one mile from land in the middle of the Solent, Hamphire, offers the unique stay in the height of luxury.

Luxury: Spitbank Fort in the Solent offers a unique first date in the lap of luxury for a cool £34,000

Extravagant: Couples are given access to the fort's top deck and an opulent champagne bar

Bottoms up: Three of the fort's 50 rooms are bars, including one champagne room

The couple will be chauffeur driven in a Bentley to nearby Gosport marina where they board a luxury 60ft sunseeker yacht, which is at their disposal for 24 hours.

The duo are greeted with a champagne and canapé reception before enjoying the 360 degree views over the strip of water between the Isle of Wight and the mainland.

They will also have full access to the fort's eight bedrooms, three private dining rooms, three bars, a rooftop champagne area, a wine cellar, library, jacuzzi, sauna and a sun deck.

Also included in the price, offered by property tycoons Clarenco, is £500 pounds spending money at nearby Gunwharf Quays, a personal masseur, a string quarter, five course menu in the evening and breakfast in bed the following morning.

Style: The fort was bought for a reported £1million at auction in 2009 and then refurbished

Exclusive: For £34,000, the couple have access to the fort's lavishly decorated eight bedrooms

Horizon: The couple pay for unparalleled views across the Solent at the fort one mile from land

A string quartet is on hand during dinner and a leisurely boat trip around the Isle of Wight is also offered.

The previous most expensive first 
date was offered at £45,000 pounds by Amberley Castle in West Sussex. However a spokeswoman at the castle confirmed no one had taken up the offer 
and it was no longer available.

A Clarenco spokesperson said: 'If 
you are looking to really impress someone with an altogether more 
memorable first date then look no further than Spitbank Fort.

Oppulent: The top deck of the fort includes a hot tub and fire pit

'Surrounded by water, your arrival at 
the Fort promises to be a dramatic one. As you step aboard the Fort, it 
becomes apparent the true splendour of the location which you will spend
your next 24 hours.'

Spitbank, a
grade II listed monument, was built in 1878 and initially designed to 
protect Portsmouth Harbour.

It was only disposed of by the Ministry of Defence in 1982 and sold at auction in 2009 for a reported £1million.
