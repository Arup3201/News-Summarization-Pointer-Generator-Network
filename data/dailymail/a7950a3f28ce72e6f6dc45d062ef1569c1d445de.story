A drug addict has admitted killing his own toddler son, who died of an overdose after swallowing a huge amount of his father's heroin.

Daniel Jones, who was 23 months old, passed away after consuming a whole wrap of the Class A drug at home in May last year. 

Parents Emma Bradburn, 34, and Simon Jones, 30, were arrested in December after extensive tests on Daniel's body revealed there was enough heroin in his system to kill an adult.

Death: Parents Simon Jones and Emma Bradburn have admitted playing a part in the death of their baby son Daniel Jones, who died of a heroin overdose last year

Further examination of hair samples from Daniel - who was known to social services - revealed he had also been exposed to a horrifying cocktail of drugs.

The court heard he suffered 'chronic' exposure to cannabis and opiates and 'occasional' exposure to amphetamines and cocaine.

Jones today pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the youngster when he appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Victim: Daniel was nearly two when he died, after swallowing a wrap of heroin he found

His partner had previously admitted causing or allowing the death of her child, but had denied manslaughter.

Prosecutors revealed yesterday they would accept Bradburn's guilty plea to the lesser charge.

Daniel was pronounced dead when paramedics were called to the £200,000 home the pair shared in Wolverhampton, West Midlands at 6.15am on May 29.

Roger Blezzard, prosecuting, told the court previously: 'Both of the defendants were living together with a small child.

'Their behaviour resulted in the child taking an overdose of heroin which has caused his death.

'Substantial evidence of exposure to other controlled drugs was also found from toxicology reports from the child's hair.

'There is the suspicion the child had been exposed for some time to drug consumption.'

The pair were remanded in custody for reports to be prepared and will be sentenced on July 3.

Police revealed after the case that they had found a cannabis factory in the couple's loft following the death of Daniel.

Neighbours revealed how the couple had moved to the area after Bradburn was given a hefty compensation payout following a car accident several years ago.

Local resident Natalie Baker, 38, said: 'She got compensation following an accident and was in a coma for about a year.

'They bought the house outright and moved up here from Low Hill which is a more downmarket area.

'It was a bit of a shock when it all happened.

'They seemed to have a lot of support from family members who were always coming and going.

'But there were also coppers everywhere so we knew something was wrong.

'They told all of us it was cot death which seemed a bit suspicious because he was too old.

'I asked her a couple of months ago if she'd had the funeral yet but she said they were still waiting for toxicology results.

Crime scene: Daniel consumed the drugs in the £200,000 home in Wolverhampton he lived in with his mother and father (pictured) until he died in May 2012

'I knew they smoked weed because you could constantly smell it coming from the house.

'There were lots of dodgy characters always coming and going.

'But I had no idea about the harder stuff.

'It makes me sick to think about it.

Shame: Baby Daniel lived in a home strewn with drug paraphernalia, which the parents tried to hide from the authorities

'Daniel was ever such a sweet little boy, he called himself 'Superman' because he always wore a t-shirt with the red and yellow 'S' on it.'

Other residents said Daniel's death had been 'devastating' for the local community.

Anthony Baker, 67, and daughter Natalie, 38, who live next door, added: 'It was devastating.

'He was an ordinary child. I used to have a laugh with him over the fence.

'He was just a normal happy child.'

Another neighbour said: 'Daniel was a little sunbeam, his smile would light up a room.

'It's evil, atrocious and appalling what has happened to such a beautiful little boy.'

Detective Inspector John Smith, from the Wolverhampton Public Protection Unit, said today: 'This is a tragic case where a young life has so needlessly been lost because of the carelessness of those who should have been there to ensure his safety.

Officers who initially visited the scene reported finding a clean and well maintained house that looked like any 'normal' family home - but then upstairs we found a very different story.

'Away from the areas where people may visit, the main bedroom was untidy and strewn with drug paraphernalia and this is the room in which the family slept.

'It seems that during his short life, Daniel became accustomed to living amongst these items and, tragically, consumed a quantity of heroin that ultimately led to his death.

'We don't know exactly how the youngster came to ingest the illegal drug - but we do know that he should never have been exposed to them in any case.

'Those who should have been caring him for him ultimately caused his untimely and tragic death.'

A spokeswoman for Wolverhampton City 
Council confirmed the authority's Safeguarding Children's Board has 
launched a serious case review into Daniel's death.

The couple will be sentenced next month.
