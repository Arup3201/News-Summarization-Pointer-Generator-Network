Reckless sightseers are risking their lives to take a peak at a collapsing coastal mansion - by walking up a huge landslide.

Several tourists have been spotted clambering up a massive landslip which collapsed under the cliff top property.

The home, Ridgemont House, has been left uninhabitable after a mass rock slide under its front garden at the 150ft Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon.

Concerned council chiefs have warned the public to steer clear of the doomed property that could come plunging down at any moment.

Officials have been forced to rope off the entire home after the stress of the collapse caused the brick house to start falling down.

But people have seen been spotted trying to access the fragile house - by walking UP the landslide from the beach.

Local resident Charlotte Osborne, 15, snapped two people climbing up the cliff-face on Sunday afternoon as she took photos from a safe vantage point.

Her mum Jenny said: 'We couldn't believe our eyes. We went to take photos of the house and saw people climbing up the rocks.

'I guess these people - we think it was a girl and a boy, perhaps in their late teens - were trying to see how high up the cliff face they could get.

'We couldn't believe how stupid they could be. They must have seen the warning sign. It was so dangerous.

'The sooner the house goes the better because people are going to look at it.'

Ridgemont House has been at the centre of a bitter legal battle ever since it was deemed unsafe by a landslide one week after being sold at auction.

The six-bedroom pile, just 50 yards from the cliff edge, was bought for Â£155,000 in February 2010 - via a telephone bid by a woman who had never been there.

But the new owner later became engaged in a legal war with the builder who sold it to her - but a judge ordered her to pay him what she owed.

A spokesman for Torbay Council said: 'We understand the privately-owned property is in a dangerous position and we would advise members of the public not to enter the site.

'The site is contained by fences and walls which can be reasonably expected to protect the public from danger.

'As further rocks falls occur, we anticipate the building will suffer further collapse.'
