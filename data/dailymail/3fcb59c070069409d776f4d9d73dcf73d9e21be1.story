North Korea's leaders probably wanted the world to join the dictatorship in grieving for Kim Jong Il, a year after his death.

However, pictures from the state's news channel have taken the focus away from the former leader, whose embalmed body went on display in his trademark khaki jumpsuit, to his son's wife.

Walking alongside Kim Jong Un, Ri Sol-Ju looked as though she may be pregnant.

Video footage appears to show her - the only woman in a parade past Jong Il's body in the Kumsusan mausoleum - wearing some kind of black maternity dress.

If there is any doubt, a second clip on a square outside the former presidential palace in Pyongyang offers a side profile that confirms what many now believe. A new dictator is on its way.

A man answering the phone at the Embassy of North Korea today said: 'I have no idea, I have no comment.'

When pressed on the matter and after highlighting the images, he repeated: 'I have no idea, I have no comment. Don't call me again.'

The body of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il lies in state after his death last year. His embalmed body, still in his trademark khaki jump-suit, has been put on display on the anniversary of his death

Compared to a previous televised event, Ri Sol-ju appears much more slim, fuelling speculation that she is pregnant

In October, Ri Sol-ju appeared in public for the first time in two months after what was believed to be 'home detention'.

However, after it was revealed that she might be pregnant, there was speculation that she was in the early stages of maternity.

Kim Jong Il's embalmed body is 
currently lying in state a few floors below his father, national founder
Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il has been laid out beneath a red blanket, with a
spotlight shining on his face.

Wails echoed through the cold hall as a group of North Korean women sobbed as they bowed before his body.

The hall bearing the glass coffin was opened to select visitors for the first time since his death.

Kim's yacht and his armoured train carriage, where he is said to have died, was also put on display.

Among the personal belongings 
featured in the mausoleum are the parka, sunglasses and pointed platform
shoes he wore in the last decades of his life. A MacBook Pro lay open 
on his desk.

North Koreans paid homage to Kim 
while still enjoying the success of last week's launch of a long-range 
rocket that sent a satellite named after him to space.

The launch, condemned in many other 
capitals as a violation of bans against developing its missile 
technology, was portrayed not only as a gift to Kim Jong Il but also as 
proof that his young son, Kim Jong Un, has the strength and vision to 
lead the country.

Kim, the elder, died on December 17 2011 from a heart attack while travelling on his train.

The satellite bears one of Kim Jong 
Il's nicknames, Kwangmyongsong, or 'Lode Star,' a moniker given to him 
at birth according to officials. 

And while life he was a mere 5ft 2 ins tall, in death the formidable leader has been increased to gigantic proportions.

Mourners paid respects to Kim on the first anniversary of his death by bowing before an enormous statue of him.

Thousands
of mourners gathered in front of the statues of Kim Jong-il and North 
Korea founder Kim Il-sung as sirens wailed for three minutes.

Soldiers and civilians prayed in silence and presented flowers to statues of current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-il and grandfather Kim Il-sung.

Earlier in the day, leader Kim Jong-un attended a mass national memorial rally for his father.

When Kim Jong-il died on December 17, 2011 his son was hailed as the 'great successor'.

During his years as head of the secretive state, the economy fell deeper into poverty as he developed as he lavished money on a nuclear arms programme and missiles aimed to hit neighbours Japan and South Korea.

His own father, whose statue stands beside him, was the first ruler of North Korea, a man so revered he is called the Eternal President even though he died in 1994.

His embalmed body can be reached on travelators that take respectful visitors through the vast Kumsusan Memorial Palace to bow before it and weep.

In that year power passed to his son Kim Jong-il, still called the Supreme Leader, who was succeeded in 2011 amid weeks of hysterical compulsory mourning by Kim Jong-un, at 29 the world’s youngest leader.
