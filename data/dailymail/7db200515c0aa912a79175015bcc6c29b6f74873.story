A
first time mum-to-be at 35, Ashley Pearson writes in a weekly column on
Femail Online about fertility issues, the ups and downs of pregnancy 
and ultimately the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who
may have come a bit late to the party, but is happy to be here just the
same...

As I wandered, contraction-ridden through the overheated hallways of the labour ward at Chelsea Westminister Hospital, I wondered if I had made a serious mistake in choosing to give birth here.

Post-pregnancy woes: Ashley didn't realise how much havoc having a baby would wreak on her body

No, not because of the overcrowding, the long wait to see a doctor, the desperately hot atmosphere (I was told that despite the warm temperatures outside, the heaters were still running and no one knew how to turn them off) but because I was surrounded by women who appeared to have arrived straight from a photo shoot.

Literally.  There was not one mum to be bigger than a size 10 (US size 6), hair was freshly blown out, nails immaculate and they’d perfected that whole 'I have make up on but it looks like I don’t' look. 

I arrived swollen, sweating and irritable, in the only item of maternity clothes that still fit me, with hair that could have used a washing and at least three sizes bigger than anyone else. I couldn’t believe it.

Hadn’t anyone else gained weight in any place other than their picture perfect tiny bumps? I felt like a hippo who had wandered into a savanna populated only by gazelles.

After a difficult birth which culminated in an unplanned C-section, I was over the moon delighted to bring home my beautiful, healthy baby girl.

Everything I had heard about the all consuming love you feel for this little person was true. My gratitude was overwhelming. It was completely life-changing; and beyond my greatest expectations.  

It was also hugely difficult.  I’d anticipated challenges with breast feeding, lack of sleep, shifting hormones and recovering from the surgery, and I found them. 

However, what I was totally unprepared for is the state of my body after childbirth.  Naively, I had expected to walk out of that hospital not looking pregnant anymore.

The reality was that in addition to still appearing to be deep into my second trimester, I actually looked heavier than ever, as my nine month sized bump had served to distract from what was going on with the rest of me, which had now aggressively re-emerged from the background.

Seeing myself for the first time out of the shower was jarring. I wish more women had warned me about how that might feel. 

The first time I saw myself in a mirror post baby, the angry purple stretch marks, the milk- heavy breasts, the excess, loose skin on my formerly pilates-honed abs, was truly demoralising.  Some of it was due to the baby of course, but to some degree, much of it was my own doing.

Having not thought about my weight or denied myself anything food-wise for the past nine months, I was left with the result.  I realised that I had a mountain to climb and felt entirely unprepared.

Tough: Like Zac Goldsmith's wife Alice, 27, getting her pre-baby figure back has proved challenging for Ashley

Gathering up my courage, I decided to tackle things head on and step on the scales.  To my shock and horror I discovered I was 20 pounds heavier than when I had gone into the hospital! I had delivered a nine pound baby - how could that possibly be?

As I expressed my dismay and began frantically Googling , I noticed a sheepish expression flicker across my husband’s face.

Apparently, when I’d decided on impulse to weigh myself a week before I was due to give birth (after having avoided the scales through most of the second and all of the third trimester) my husband had shaved off a solid 25 pounds - being unable to see the digital read out myself over my massive belly.

'I knew you’d be upset,' he said guilty, 'and you had enough to worry about, so I knocked off a few pounds when you asked me what it said.'

The man clearly knows me too well.  While it may have been insightful at the time, I was now left with a bitter and very unappealing truth about the state of things.

A stone heavier than normal when I’d conceived, I had gained another three stone during the pregnancy.

I thought about celebrities like Kate Hudson who managed to shift 80 pounds of pregnancy weight in three months before heading back to work on a film.  I was amazed at her self discipline and openly coveted her daily trainer, nannies and personal chef.

The famously self-disciplined Victoria Beckham told Vogue that after the birth of her baby Harper, she headed straight to the gym and followed a workout regime prepared by celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson. 'I worked out a lot. I ran a lot. I did it six days a week. I become quite obsessive when I get into something.' 

Beyonce was back on stage within several months of giving birth Blue Ivy and wearing sexy catsuits that showed off a stunning post-pregnancy body. She said at the time, 'Y’all have no idea how hard I worked. I had to lose 60 pounds. They had me on that treadmill. I ate lettuce!'

Comparing myself to these women just made me feel more inadequate. I felt completely out of my league. Exhausted I could barely function let alone imagine working out. In fact, due to my surgery, I had been warned off working out for 8-12 weeks.

Demoralising: Both Beyonce and Gwyneth Paltrow got their bodies back but admit it was hard work

Tiring: Instead of seeing her next pregnancy as a holiday, Ashley will treat it like an Ironman challenge

As I struggled with night feeds, breast feeding and taking care of my new baby, I still couldn’t shake off the new and awful feeling that I no longer felt like myself. My life looked nothing like it had before and I was walking around in a body that just didn’t feel like my own.  

Needing to heal and advised to wait until exercising, I made a few big decisions in the weeks to come.  I stopped stepping on the scales for one. I knew it would take time to get back to a place where I felt good, and I didn’t want the pressure of worrying about numbers.

I also immediately ordered some clothes in sizes that would have formerly filled me with dread - but that actually fit me at the weight I now was.

Therefore I could stop picking through my meagre and well worn selection of maternity gear.  And lastly I made a decision to treat myself to a diet home delivery food programme. Knowing I had no time to shop for healthy food, the energy to prepare it or the discipline to meal plan, I figured after what I’d been through I deserved it.

I chose Soulmate foods because I’d heard the food was good and they were able to tailor a programme for breast feeding mums like myself.  All three decisions were good ones for me.

It began to dawn on me that I ought to endeavour to love and care for my altered and changed body the way I loved my new baby. Putting up with all indignities without hesitation and forgiving everything without question.

These were the first of many steps I knew it would take to get back to a place that felt like me. It was going to be a long journey but ultimately I would focus on keeping my baby healthy and trying to be patient with what my body could now do.

As a mother over 35 I was learning the hard way that it’s especially vital to be in great physical shape when having a baby.  After all, we are already pushing our bodies to do something it would have physically preferred to do a decade ago.

We are asking a tremendous amount of our bodies –and maintaining optimum health and fitness before and during our pregnancies seems the least we can do in return.

Indeed, next time I get pregnant, if there is a next time, I will do things very differently.   In her wonderful book, How To Be A Woman, Caitlin Moran talks about her second pregnancy and says:

'This time around though, I’m doing things differently. For starters, I haven’t spent the last two months of my pregnancy thinking, "Let Christmas last forever! Every morning can start with two mince pies, served with cream, six miniature heroes, and some Pringles! It’s Crisp-mas! Hurrah for pregnant me!"

'As a result, I haven’t put on forty pounds, and I’m capable of things like "walking", "standing", and "getting off the sofa without making an 'Oooof' Sound".'

Looking back, my biggest error was not viewing my pregnancy from a physical fitness perspective. It’s a gruelling physical challenge requiring a great deal of preparation and constant care.

Afterwards, I felt like I had run a marathon that I’d prepared for by walking around the block.  Indeed, beleaguered by morning sickness at points and tiredness at others, I treated my pregnancy in its entirety like it was a condition or illness; resting, taking it easy, pampering myself – whereas I will view the next one like the Ironman challenge it is.
