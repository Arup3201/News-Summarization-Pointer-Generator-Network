A Holocaust evacuee has finally had
proof that his parents were killed in Auschwitz after a photo of his 
father's suitcase there was sent to him by a tourist 69 years on.

Harry Grenville, 87, had heard no news of his 
parents, Jacob and Klara Greilsamer, and grandmother, Sara Ottenheimer, 
since a message in 1944 said they were being sent 
'east' from an internment camp.

He was 18 at the time and suspected this 
meant they were being sent to the extermination camps in Poland. He never saw 
or heard from them again.

Now Mr Grenville has been sent a 
poignant picture of an old suitcase which has been displayed at the 
Auschwitz Museum for years. It bears the name of his father, Jacob Greilsamer, and a serial number.

This picture of a suitcase belonging to Jacob Greilsamer, confirmed Harry's parents were taken to Auschwitz

The photo was recently taken by a 
Polish visitor to the museum. He researched the names on the cases and 
contacted a historical society near Mr Grenville's former home town of 
Ludwigsburg, near Stuttgart.

The
grandfather's details was listed with the group of historians two years
ago when three brass memorial stones were unveiled outside the former 
family home and they have emailed him the photo.

Mr Grenville, who was evacuated to Britain in the Kindertransport refugee mission, said: 'Out of the blue a photograph has turned up of a whole lot of suitcases of victims at the Auschwitz Museum.

'They have the names of the victims painted on them in white and low and behold, there on this photograph is my father's name.

'It was a bit of a shock and my heart did miss several beats when I saw it for the first time.

'This is the first evidence I have ever had that my mother, my father and my grandmother actually arrived at Auschwitz.

'I have carried suspicions with me for a long time and now I have this evidence I feel justified in my suspicions.'

Mr Grenville's family owned a successful packaging company in Germany until it was taken over by a member of the SS in 1938.

In July 1939 he and sister Hannah, who
was aged nine at the time, were sent to England and lived with a foster
family in Cornwall.

Mr 
Grenville, who was born Heinz Greilsamer, said: 'My parents knew there 
was no possible future for any Jewish children in Germany, indeed nearly
one million Jewish children died under the Nazis.

'After my sister and I left they applied to emigrate to America but nothing happened.

'They carried on living in Stuttgart 
until they were taken by the Nazis and sent to an internment camp in 
Czechoslovakia in 1942.

'The Red Cross had a system whereby, once a month, we could exchange messages that were no longer than 25 words long.

'In
them my parents just said that they were in reasonable health and we 
just said we were getting on okay at school and were quite happy. It was
rather hard.

'In the last message in October 1944 my father stated that they expected to move east. We knew what he meant because east meant the extermination camps in Poland.

'In a way my sister and I had come to expect this news.

'Years later, through a historian, I came to learn that all three of them were on the same transport to Poland.

'I suspect the serial number of 960 on the case was the number of the cattle train that took them to Auschwitz.'

Before the end of the war Mr Grenville had built up such a hatred of his homeland that he volunteered to join the British army.

He added: 'I had a quarrel with the Germans, although I now know it was with the Nazis.'

He didn't get the chance to fight in Europe and served as an interpreter at German Prisoner of War camps in England. He left the army four years later.

He worked as a biology schoolteacher for 34 years and married his late wife Helen in 1950. They have three children and two grandchildren.

His sister, Hannah Robinson, is now aged 83 and lives in New York.

Mr Grenville, who was made a British citizen in 1947, returned to Ludwigsburg for the first time two years ago for the unveiling of the commemorative 'Stumble Stones'.

He said: 'There will never be closure but I take a great deal of comfort from the fact that the second and third generations after the Nazis are trying to bring about reconciliation and a confession of the sins of their forefathers.'

Main gate of Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz

Auschwitz 
established by Germans in 1940, in the suburbs of Oswiecim, a Polish 
city that was annexed to the Third Reich by the Nazis.

Initially it was to be a concentration camp similar to others set up by the Nazis since the early 1930s.

It became a death camp in 1942, and it is estimated 1.1 million people were killed there.

The camp was separated into two parts. The first and oldest was established on the site of barracks and held between 15,000 and 20,000 prisoners.

The second 
part was the Birkenau camp which was the largest part of the Auschwitz 
complex and held 90,000 prisoners. The Nazis began building it in 1941 
on the site of the village of Brzezinka, three kilometers from Oswiecim.

Auschwitz was liberated on January 27 1945 by Soviet troops.
