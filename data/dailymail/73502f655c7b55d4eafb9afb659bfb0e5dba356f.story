Ever wondered what it’s like to be a pilot?

One technical wizard has shot a beautiful video from the cockpit of a plane on its 2,136 mile journey from Tokyo to San Francisco.

The flight time is almost ten hours but the footage has been condensed into just 83 seconds, taking in blue skies, sunsets and even the rise of the planet Venus.

Watch the video below...

The time-lapse video is comprised of more than 3,400 images shot on a GoPro camera plugged into a portable iPhone charger.

It gives viewers a taste of the spectacular views that pilots enjoy as they jet around the world, with both sunrise and sunset captured as well as glorious night skies.

In the information provided with the video, the director also states that the planet Venus can be seen rising in the night sky at around the 42 second mark.

From night to day: The video cuts to darkness for a few seconds before it's approach to San Francioco

The route: Narita to San Francisco airport takes almost 10 hours

Sunrise over the Pacific: The footage also captures the early morning light as the plane approaches California

The video begins with the Boeing 747-400’s 
journey from takeoff at Narita airport in Tokyo, to landing in San 
Francisco, and has dazzled viewers since it was posted on YouTube.

Referring
 to point in which the total darkness of the night sky is captured, one 
user, Carnered101, commented: I was upset that there was a giant dead 
spot in the middle of the video. Then I realized I was an idiot.﻿'

Francisco and probably the best view of a sunrise that you will ever 
see.﻿

Another YouTube viewer added: 'Wow! That transition from dark to light gave me chills. Makes you feel a whole lot smaller, this video.'
