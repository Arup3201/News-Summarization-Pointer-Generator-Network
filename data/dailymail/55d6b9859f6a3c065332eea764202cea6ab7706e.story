Germany defenders will find it easy to kick Cristiano Ronaldo in the face in Salvador - as it's adorning his shinpads.

The Portugal star will be the centre of attention as his nation kick-off their World Cup Group G campaign against the Germans.

And, in a typical blaze of modesty, Ronaldo will have his own mug on his shinpads.

Facing facts: Cristiano Ronaldo's kit including his shin pad with his mug on it (left picture, bottom right) and warming up before the Germany match (right)

The 29-year-old is the best player on the planet and one of the faces of the World Cup.

And following his exploits with Real Madrid in the Champions League last season, he is known in the German media as 'Germany's Tormentor'.

Newspaper Tagesspiegel wrote before the match: 'Germanyâ€™s chances of a good start to the World Cup would improve dramatically if they can play Ronaldo out of the game'.

That might be even more of an incentive for Mats Hummels and Co!
