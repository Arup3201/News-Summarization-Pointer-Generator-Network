It is the kind of talk Alejandro Sabella is trying to discourage. This almost unbreakable belief, among Argentina’s players, that not only will they create chances but that Lionel Messi will almost certainly take them.

It is some position to be in at a World Cup. A source of confidence that must empower every member of the Argentina squad. But Sabella keeps stressing the need to be less reliant on their captain and  inspiration and the chat among his players after securing safe passage to the last 16, and an encounter with Switzerland in Sao Paulo next week, will do little to appease him.

Fernando Gago spoke of two certainties in the life of this Argentina team. Firstly: ‘That we’re going to have two or three great chances to score every game.’ And secondly: ‘That we’ve got the best player in the world.’

The four goals Messi has already scored in this tournament, the first two securing victory in their opening two group matches, would suggest Gago has a point.

And in fairness to the Boca Juniors midfielder, he also acknowledged ‘the need’ for Argentina ‘to improve in other areas’.

But Federico Fernandez echoed the view of his colleague on the remarkable Messi. ‘Well I think he’s demonstrated it again, hasn’t he?’ he said. ‘Another great goal, he always pops up.’

True enough he does, with impressive frequency. But Nigeria, like Iran before them, exposed a degree of vulnerability at the opposite end of the field and Peter Odemwingie sees a fragile defence as Argentina’s ‘weak link’.

‘They can definitely be opened up,’ said Stoke’s Nigerian international forward.  ‘No disrespect but there is not much pace in the middle and the second-half showed that.

‘If you don’t let them just play slowly from the back they are in trouble. The key to success against this team is to force them to kick it long. We did that, intercepted their long balls and went fast on the counter-attacks.

‘I think even Iran had success against Argentina by doing that. We had seven, eight, nine shots we could have scored from today.

‘We also saw that when Argentina played Bosnia; how they played, there were chances for the opposition. Defence is not the strongest part of their game.  Iran could have scored a few so we went into this game knowing we could get goals. We got two and we could have had more.’

Sabella describes his side as an ‘offensive team’ and Odemwingie would not disagree.

‘The quality they have is all up front’ he said. ‘The movement of Higuain, Aguero, Di Maria, who surprised us with long-range shots today, that is their strength.

‘But the defence, that’s their weak link. The way they play, to get their results, they have to take the game to the other half of the pitch. They know they have to do that because if they play in their own half they are going to be in trouble. They are doing the right thing, playing too their strengths.’

An interesting debate emerged from the post-match interview area at the Estadio Beira-Rio. Javier Mascherano thought there was already evidence to suggest the South American teams had an advantage because of the unique conditions in this part of the world. While Odemwingie thought the decisive factor would simply be fitness.

‘It’s not easy to play in America,’ said Argentina’s Mascherano. ‘I think now people are realising that. It’s different. World Cups here are more difficult. The pitches are not like they are in Europe. They’re drier, the climate is different, the time, there are lots of variables.

The football is not played with the speed with which European teams are used to playing. Maybe that suits the South American teams more. Hopefully those variables will favour the South American teams because that would mean that we have a chance. Although Holland are not South American and they are playing very well.’

Odemwingie had a different view. ‘Any team can surprise anyone at this World Cup,’ he said. ‘My first impression from this tournament is that the fittest team will win it. If you don’t let the opposition play and you are fit, you are going to get scoring opportunities.

And if you are very fit you don’t let them play. And that is the key to winning this World Cup. The second-halves are longer than you wish them to be here.’

Whoever turns out to be right, Argentina’s players accept they must show more discipline at the back.

‘There’s a lot to think about,’ said Marcos Rojo, who was not at his best in defence but did manage to score Argentina’s winning goal.

‘In defence we have to improve because they’ve put two past us and that puts pressure on those up front.’

As for the man himself, he sounded a little more positive. ‘It’s always good to win games at any level but there’s much more to come,’ said Messi.

His team-mates expect nothing less.
