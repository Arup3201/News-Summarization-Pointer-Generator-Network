Adam Peaty followed up his record-breaking exploits on Friday with another gold medal on Saturday as he claimed the men's 50 metres breaststroke title at the European Championships in Berlin.

Peaty set a new world record of 26.62 seconds in the semi-finals and he was too good for the competition during the final as well to clinch his third gold of the week in a time of 27.00.

The 19-year-old was not the only British winner on the penultimate day of the championships either.

Record-breaker: The 19-year-old powered to victory in the 50m breastroke final on Saturday

Fran Halsall led home a British one-two ahead of Georgia Davies in the women's 50m backstroke final, the 24-year-old lifting the title in a new personal best time of 27.81seconds.

Halsall's gold was her second in Berlin having also won the 4x100m mixed medley relay alongside Peaty earlier this week in what was another world-record performance.

There was further good news as Davies - who won gold for Wales in the 50m backstroke at the Commonwealth Games - finished just one hundredth of a second behind her team-mate to take the silver.

Britain now boast six gold medals from the event and Halsall will go for more glory in the 50m freestyle after qualifying second fastest for the final.
