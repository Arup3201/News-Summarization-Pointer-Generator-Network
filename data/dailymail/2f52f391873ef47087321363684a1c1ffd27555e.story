David Luiz has picked his dream XI of stars he has played with throughout his career (with one notable anomaly) - and it features four former Chelsea team-mates, as well as himself at centre back.

Interestingly there is no place for Blues skipper John Terry though, with Thiago Silva partnering Luiz in central defence.

Luiz's dream team was unveiled on Paris Saint-Germain's YouTube channel - and, perhaps controversially, he could not squeeze the Ligue 1 champions' star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic into his side.

But his former Blues team-mates Petr Cech, Branislav Ivanovic, Michael Essien and Willian all appear in his dream XI, which is set-up in a 4-4-2 formation.

Cech is in goal, with Ivanovic - who Luiz describes as being able to 'jump like a kangaroo' - and Maxwell as full backs.

In the centre of defence, Luiz is partnered by PSG and Brazil captain Thiago Silva. He says the duo 'make a nice couple'.

The Brazilian's midfield features the 'fantastic' Willian, the 'machine in the middle' Essien and Benfica's Pablo Aimar, who Luiz believes is 'the best player' he has played with.

It is completed by Manchester United's Angel di Maria, with whom Luiz played at Benfica. He describes the Argentine as 'magic'.

And, due to the quality of strikers Luiz has played with in his career, Brazil forward Neymar - who he believes will soon become the best player in the world - and Barcelona's Lionel Messi feature ahead of Ibrahimovic up front.

Strangely, Luiz has never actually played for the same club as Messi, but has chosen him in his side 'having played against him plenty of times'.

Luiz signed for PSG from Chelsea for £50million during the summer.
