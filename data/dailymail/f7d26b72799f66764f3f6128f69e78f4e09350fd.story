The world’s oldest two-toed sloth has just celebrated her 45th birthday – but she’s not thinking about slowing down, because if she did she probably wouldn’t move at all.

Paula is one of the stars at Halle zoo in Germany and was pictured on her birthday doing what she loves best – just hanging around using her lengthy claws.

And eating a nice bowl of cooked maize.

Confusion: When Paula was born her keepers thought she was male and named her Paul, but an examination as late as 1994 established that the animal was in fact female

When Paula was born her keepers thought she was male and named her Paul, but an examination as late as 1994 established that the animal was in fact female.

There are 377 sloths registered as living in zoos worldwide and they are officially the world’s slowest mammal.

They are so sedentary – they spend up to 20 hours a day asleep - that moths, beetles and even algae have been found in their fur.

The animals are usually found in trees in Central and South America – and even mate and give birth while hanging from branches.

A little known fact is that they’re actually surprisingly good swimmers.

Three-toed sloths are slightly smaller than their two-toed cousins.
