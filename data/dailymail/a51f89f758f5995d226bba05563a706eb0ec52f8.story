A University student has filed a $3 million lawsuit against a fraternity who he alleges beat him so severely  that he was left with bruises on his buttocks.

Kevin Hayes filed the lawsuit against Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity in Prince George's County Circuit Court in Maryland for battering, hazing, false imprisonment and gross negligence during pledging. 

The Bowie State University student alleged that  APA members Mike Ross, Keenan Goins and others punched, hit, slapped, body slammed and paddled him during the fall of 2013.

He told WUSA-TV: 'It broke me down. It hurt. It was something that I had never experienced before.'

At the time of the incident, Goins was a graduate student and Ross was not a student at the time, according to the lawsuit.

Hayes said that he was told to  attend five-to-eight-hour meetings, in which he had to learn chapter and fraternity information. However, he was beaten if any of the information was wrong.

The junior college student  said the punishments included Jewel Shockers (side slaps), Back Racks (back slaps), Fat Joes (chest slaps), as well as taking 'wood' (paddling).

The pledges were also told to only wear specific colors and not to report what they were experiencing during hazing. 

However, after he gave a frat leader photographic evidence of the abuse, he was told there would be changes to the way pledging was carried out.

But then things changed and Hayes said he was branded a 'snitch.'. 

According to the lawsuit, Hayes said that fraternity members threatened him and his mother, saying they would 'come by her house and see her.' 

He added: 'They said 'You're a snitch. Oh, you're always talking. We're never going to accept you. We're going to black ball you. Then they began to ostracize me.' 

Hayes told WUSA-TV: 'It broke me down. It hurt. It was something that I had never experienced before.'

Bruise: The Bowie State University student alleged that this is the bruise, which has been blurred, left on his backside after APA members punched, hit, slapped, body slammed and paddled him during the fall of 2013

Policy: Bowie State University said it has a 'stringent anti-hazing policy that is coupled with a strong anti-hazing education program.'

The student said that he was ignored by other fraternity members and their friends.

But his mother did not report the physical abuse to the police. 

Hayes' attorney Jim Bell, pictured, told WUSA-TV: 'They [the police] have a duty under Maryland law to keep him safe.'

Maryland has strict anti-hazing laws which prohibit anyone from putting a student at risk of' serious bodily injury for the purpose of initiation.'

In a statement, Bowie university acknowledged the lawsuit.

It said: 'Bowie State University is aware of the the lawsuit filed today alleging an incidence of hazing by a fraternity on our campus. 

'We understand that the university is not named as a party in the suit and we are not able to comment about any allegations cited in the suit,' the university said in a statement.

'Bowie State University has a stringent anti-hazing policy that is coupled with a strong anti-hazing education program. 

'The university considers hazing to be indefensible and contrary to the interest of the university community. 

'We work continuously with Greek and other student organizations to assure understanding that no activity that causes mental, physical or social harm will be tolerated.'

However, the lawsuit alleged that school advisers never had anyone examine Hayes after the allegations were made.

Hayes, is currently an executive member-at-large for Student Government Association for the 2014-2015 school year. 

He is also a member of the University of Maryland system's Student Council for the 2014-2015 school year. Hayes has been a member of the Maryland Army National Guard since 2013.
