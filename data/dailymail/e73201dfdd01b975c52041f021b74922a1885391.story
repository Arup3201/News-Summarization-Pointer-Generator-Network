When it comes to our sex lives it seems that, for many of us, the most action we're getting is a poke on Facebook.

A new survey from condom brand Durex has revealed that British lovers are allowing technology to get in the way of their sex lives.

In a poll of 2000 men and women over 15 per cent of women and 17 per cent of men admitted to answering their phone or reading a text message during sex, a figure that rises in the capital to 20 per cent.

Some 40 per cent of us agree that technology is getting in the way of our relationship

Some of us have even admitted to side lining our lovers in favour of social networks, with a shocking five per cent saying they had even checked Facebook while making love.

Men are twice as likely to make the social media faux pas as women with eight per cent of men admitting to checking a social network compared to just four per cent of women.

It appears that our infatuation with our tech could be damaging our real life relationships.

Some 30 per cent of respondents said that their partner had been distracted by some sort of tech device whilst they were getting intimate, nearly three in ten believing that it gets in the way of their sex life and 40 per cent agreeing or strongly agreeing that it has a negative effect on their relationship. 

A further 60 per cent also admitted that they actually spend more time using technology while in bed with their partner than having sex.

This problem of third wheeling laptops and gooseberry iPads is something that, unsurprisingly, is affecting the younger generation more than their older counterparts.

Over half of 18-24 year olds believe that technology is adversely affecting their relationship compared with only a quarter of over 55s.

Sex and Relationship expert, Susan 
Quilliam, said: 'Many people find love through dating websites or social
 media - but it's a worrying trend that many are also feeling gradually 
ousted in their relationships in favour of interaction online.'

As a call to action, Durex is 
releasing a short film which follows the stories of several couples who,
 like most of us, have become seduced by the lure of a screen and 
encourages people to make the most of Earth Hour by reconnecting whilst 
the lights are off.  

Earth
 Hour is an annual event organised by charity, WWF to encourage people 
around the world to turn off their lights for one hour to celebrate 
their commitment to the planet.

Durex is celebrating the annual event by encouraging people to not only turn off all lights on 29 
March but to also switch off their tech, and use the opportunity to 
reconnect with each other whilst the lights are off.

As part of Earth Hour on 29 March, Durex is encouraging us to turn our tech off and turn our partners on

Susan goes on to say: 'There is, of course, a great place for technology in our lives but habitual use and reliance on our gadgets can lead to bad habits in relationships.  Durex’s film is a great reminder that we need to take time out to get up close and intimate with our lovers, and reconnect with their needs face-to-face.'

Ukonwa Ojo, Global Marketing Manager at Durex said:  'Durex believes nothing should get in the way of great sex but our growing obsession with phones, laptops, TVs and Tablets isn’t bringing us closer together, it’s pushing us apart.

'So, this Earth Hour let’s log off and switch off; use it as an excuse to swap our laptops for some loving and ditch our phones to enjoy some foreplay. Let’s turn off to turn on!' 

The Turn Off Turn On film  can be viewed on YouTube from 19 March #turnofftoturnon
