The son of a hockey legend has been arrested for allegedly selling New York Rangers' player Derek Boogaard the prescription drugs that killed him in 2011.

Jordan Hart, 31, was arrested on Long Island on Tuesday morning by the DEA's New York drug enforcement task force and appeared in court in Manhattan on Tuesday.

A Utah physician's assistant, Oscar Johnson, was also arrested in the death and stands accused of writing bogus oxycodone prescriptions for Hart,FOX reported.

Hart, the son of Islanders player Gerry Hart and himself a former minor league player, is accused of selling 28-year-old Boogaard the pills ahead of his death in Minneapolis on May 13, 2011.

It was ruled that his death, which came after years of injuries and addiction to painkillers, was caused by an overdose on oxycodone and alcohol. 

Boogaard had become addicted to prescription painkillers and Ambien while playing for the Minnesota Wild between 2005 and 2010, Fox reported. 

For the 2010-2011 season, he signed with the New York Rangers but at the end of 2011, he suffered a severe concussion in an on-ice fight that left him with debilitating migraines. He never played for the team again.

To deal with the injury, he turned to Ambien, which was prescribed by the Rangers, and Percocet - which contains oxycodone - which had not been prescribed by the team.

When he was looking for a source of the drugs, an unidentified teammate put him in touch with Hart, who began supplying him in Long Island, the indictment said.

Johnson, the Utah physician's assistant, allegedly often wrote the prescriptions for him.

In March 2011, Boogaard tried to return to the team but within weeks, teammates noticed that he was barely able to stand and appeared to be under the influence of something, the indictment said.

He was sent to rehab in California for a few weeks before deciding to spend the summer in Minneapolis.

But first, he stopped in New York to pick up belongings - and one final stash from Hart.

On April 29, he met with Hart in Huntington, Long Island and spent $4,000 to purchase pills, which the player then kept at his Minnesota apartment, the indictment said.

He returned to rehab and, after being given permission to leave again for a family commitment two weeks later, he flew to Minnesota, where he took one of the pills and headed out for a night of heavy drinking.

He was found dead in bed in his brother's Minneapolis apartment on May 13, 2011. 

After his death, an examination of his brain found that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), a degenerative brain disease that is caused by repeated blows to the head.

After Boogaard's death, his father, Len, found the check for $4,000, which had led to the investigation, the New York Times reported.

Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that Hart was accused of 'feeding Boogaard's growing, debilitating addiction'.

'Ultimately, that addiction, fueled at least in part by the drugs that Johnson illegally prescribed, and Hart peddled for cash, culminated in Boogaard's tragic overdose death,' he said. 

Hart is charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute oxycodone. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.

He appeared in court on Tuesday and wiped away tears from his eyes as he entered a not-guilty plea, the New York Times reported. He was ordered released on $500,000 bond.

His attorney said prosecutors would have a hard time proving the player died from pills Hart allegedly sold him.

Johnson, 59, is charged with 26 counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute oxycodone, each of which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. 

Johnson, who allegedly sold as many as 3,000 pills to Hart, was also charged with one count of making a false statement, which carries a maximum of five years in prison.

He was arrested in Salt Lake City and also appeared in court on Tuesday.

Hart, who married his wife Bella in 2012, had been a prospect for the Islanders while in college but never played for them. Instead, he played minor league hockey and ended his career in 2009 with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. 

His father, Gerry, played for the Islanders from 1972 to 1979. Hart Sr. also played for the Detroit Red Wings, Quebec Nordiques and St. Louis Blues.
