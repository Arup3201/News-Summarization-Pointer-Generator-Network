Roy Keane, unusually for a top sports personality, has acted for himself throughout the negotiations and writing of his autobiography The Second Half, to be published by Orion next week.

The process has gone remarkably smoothly according to the publishers, despite Keane never having met acclaimed author Roddy Doyle before their collaboration on the book.

Keane used to be represented by London-based solicitor Michael Kennedy, who is known as a tough negotiator. Kennedy said: ‘Roy doesn’t need an agent. He’s more than capable of looking after himself.’

A line has now been drawn under England’s woeful World Cup performance after manager Roy Hodgson explained what went wrong to the FA board last week.

Hodgson, accompanied by Club England managing director Adrian Bevington, made an hour-long presentation about events in Brazil to the FA directors at a Wembley hotel.

The board concluded that Hodgson, his backroom staff and the FA administrators had done all they could to provide the right platform for the players to perform at their best — but to everyone’s great disappointment, this hadn’t happened.

However, it was felt there was no sign of any Phil Mickelson-style discord in the England camp and that the players still had every faith in the manager.

Hodgson was fortunate to have his debriefing meeting scheduled so long after the disastrous tournament and with the bonus of making a winning start in Euro 2016 qualifying.

Although the usefulness of all members of the 88-strong World Cup party will continue to be examined, Hodgson can now concentrate on reaching France with his Brazil inquiry closed.

Stan Collymore escaped a driving ban despite clocking up 12 points on his licence at Warrington Magistrates Court after his celebrity solicitor Mark Haslam pleaded a case of exceptional hardship. Haslam, as Sports Agenda predicted, talked up the effect a ban would have on Collymore’s depression charity work, caring for his 84-year-old mother and his talkSPORT pundit job.

It summed up how boorish the Professional Cricketers’ Association awards dinner has become when a glazed Darren Gough, asked on stage by host Nasser Hussain in front of a mixed audience whether he had any plans to make a comeback like Freddie Flintoff, replied: ‘I’ve got two words for you . . . f*** off.’

KP book alert for ECB

England outcast Kevin Pietersen believes he is free from any confidentiality clause to say what he likes in his autobiography to be published next week.

But there is a different view at the England Cricket Board because a clause in the players’ central contracts, signed by Pietersen, forbids players divulging private dressing-room information ‘during or after your central contract’.

The ECB have not been given advance copies of the book by publishers Little, Brown, who feared it would have leaked. So the Lord’s lawyers will be looking closely for breaches of that contract when they eventually gain sight of the contents.

Simon Halliday, the former England rugby international who has been linked with top jobs at Twickenham, has been lined up for a leading role with European Professional Club Rugby, based in Neuchatel, Switzerland, from where the organisation will run the new European Rugby Champions Cup.

David Elleray is made an MBE by the Duke of Cambridge during an Investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle

It is hard to take the FA’s anti-discrimination stance seriously when referee grandee David Elleray received his MBE for services to football at an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.

This is the same David Elleray who escaped with only a rap over the knuckles for making a racist comment to an FA colleague during a St George’s Park summit.

Asked what he would say to anyone who questioned his eligibility for such an honour, Elleray replied: ‘I don’t think I want to comment on that.’
