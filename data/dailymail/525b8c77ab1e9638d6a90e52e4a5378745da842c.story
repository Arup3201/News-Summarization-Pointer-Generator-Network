Too young: OHL player Terry Trafford, 20, was found dead in his truck in a Michigan parking lot after disappearing eight days earlier

Police have found the body of Saginaw Spirit hockey player Terry Trafford, who disappeared eight days earlier after being disciplined by his team.

Michigan State Police informed team officials of the discovery Tuesday afternoon, the team said in a statement posted on its website.

Trafford, 20, a Toronto native, was last seen about 9.30am March 3 at the Dow Event Center, the Ontario Hockey League club's home arena.

'Our deepest condolences are with Terry's family and his friends both in Ontario and Michigan,' the Spirit said in the statement.

'Terry played on our team and was a member of the Spirit family for the last four years and he will be missed.'

State police Lt. Brian Cole told The Saginaw News and WJRT-TV Tuesday that a trooper found a man's body in an SUV similar to the one that Trafford operated outside a Walmart store in Saginaw County's Saginaw Township.

'One of our troopers was patrolling the parking lot, observed a vehicle which appeared to match the description of the vehicle that the missing player was last seen driving,' Cole told WJRT. 'He observed a deceased male inside the vehicle.'

Police did not indicate a cause of death. Cole said a state police crime lab was called to the scene.

Cole told The Associated Press that Trafford was considered a 'voluntary missing person.'

Cieszlak, 21, said her boyfriend was devastated and said that he won't be allowed to rejoin the team

Spirit President and General Manager Craig Goslin told The Saginaw News that the center was sent home 'for a violation of rules.'

SI.com reported that the OHL player was caught February 22 smoking marijuana while on a road trip.

Trafford wasn't permanently cut from the minor league team but would 'have to change his behavior and make some adjustments,' Goslin said.

In his four seasons with Saginaw, Trafford made 29 goals and 49 assists. He had eight goals and 24 assists this season.

Skye Cieszlak, 21, told the newspaper that 
she and Trafford have dated since 2010 and that he 'was devastated' 
after the team sent him home 'for partying on a road trip.'

Cieszlak
 said Trafford, who had been battling depression, sent her a text 
message Sunday that said, 'his life was over and that he didn't want to 
do it anymore.'

Before 
Trafford turned up dead in his 1995 GMC Sierra, Cieszlak tweeted: 'I 
catch myself screaming at you and crying for you at the same time.'

Saginaw Spirit teammate Gregg Sutch tweeted about his late teammate: 'Always known for being a prankster in the room, sometimes he drove you up the wall, but no matter what, you loved Traff.'

Tuesday evening, the Saginaw Spirit announced that the team had postponed Wednesday's game due to the 'tragic passing' of Trafford.
