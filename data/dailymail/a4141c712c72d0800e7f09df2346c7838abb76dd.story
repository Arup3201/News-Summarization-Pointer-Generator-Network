Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is adamant that he's a changed man.

And as the airline continues its charm offensive to win over customers, it has revealed a raft of new developments to be rolled out over the next three years.

As part of its ongoing 'Always Getting Better' transformation, the carrier is set to make some huge changes, including the introduction of 'smiley face' interiors in planes, free Wi-Fi for customers and even transatlantic flights.

Developments: The no-frills airline plans to introduce free Wi-Fi, transatlantic flights and package holidays

In an interview with the Irish Independent, the airline's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, revealed that the budget carrier has its sights set on offering flights to the US as well as well as Ryanair package holidays.

He told The Independent: 'The party line is that we still need those wide-body long-haul aircraft and we don't expect we'll get those any time soon. If someone cancels an order and some become available, however, then it's possible that we could be doing transatlantic in about three years.'

The carrier plans to launch the global flights under a separate brand, but with the same low prices and basic service of its European flights. There would however, be a business class section with more leg room.

Vertical 'seating' -  In July 2010, Ryanair introduced plans to charge passengers £4 (about $6) for standing-room-only seats. 

Fat tax - In 2009, Ryanair proposed a fat tax for overweight passengers after a third of travelers voted in favor of the extra charge in an online poll conducted by the Irish carrier. 

Spending a penny, literally - Also in 2009, Michael O'Leary mooted the idea of putting a coin slot on the toilet door. 'If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet, I'd carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver,' he said.

Carry the burden - Ryanair once thought of asking passengers to roll their own luggage across the runway and onto the aircraft themselves.

Charging passengers £40 if they forget to print out their boarding passes. 'We think they should pay €60 for being so stupid,' said O'Leary.

Could it be the end of the garish yellow? Airline bosses revealed that there are plans to revamp the interiors

Mr Jacobs has previously spoken about the airline's plans to offer package holidays, saying they could be a reality within 18 months. 

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Jacobs confirmed last month that Ryanair was planning to 'tone down' the decor on board flights - taking away the yellow colour and adding in more blue.

At the front of the planes, the airline is planning pictures of destinations, smiling customers and happy staff. 

He explained: 'We’re looking at the permanent kind of overlay decals which go in the aircraft, we’re looking at a refresh of the interiors which would take away the quite strong yellow and present different images - some of our customers, some of our staff or destinations.'

He confirmed the airline would be 'showing happy customers and attractive destinations' to make the aircraft feel 'a little bit fresher on the inside'.

The airline plans to finalise the new designs in a matter of weeks. 

There will are also hints at launching free Wi-Fi within the next two years.   

'We've started to talk to some of the more well-established Wi-Fi providers with a view to having a service up and running not in the next 12 months, but hopefully soon after,' said Mr Jacobs. 

Despite these changes, the budget carrier will remain low-cost and has recently added flights to Warsaw, Athens, Lisbon, Glasgow international, Cologne/Bonn and Copenhagen. 

The low-cost carrier has also just completed the purchase of 100 Boeing 737 Max 200s, which are valued at around £7billion.  

The 737 Max 200 is considered more fuel-efficient than most other current single-aisle airplanes and can accommodate up to 200 seats. 

Ryanair said that the order will increase its fleet to about 520 aircraft by 2024. The company runs more than 1,600 flights daily and now operates the biggest fleet of Boeing airplanes in Europe.
