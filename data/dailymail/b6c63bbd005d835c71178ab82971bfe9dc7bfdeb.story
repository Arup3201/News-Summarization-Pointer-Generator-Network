Business magnate Donald Trump has suggested he may be about to throw a lifeline to the bankrupt Atlantic City casino  that shut its doors early this morning.

Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino became the fourth casino to go belly-up in the city this year when its last few gamblers left the blackjack table at 6am.

But Mr Trump hinted that this may not be the end of the line for the resort. The real estate mogul took to social media to say he is considering buying back into both Trump Plaza and the beleaguered Trump Taj Mahal.

Mr Trump hinted that this may not be the end of the line for Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino

He tweeted: 'I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing. Now I may buy back in, at much lower price, to save Plaza & Taj. They were run badly by funds!'

The businessman opened Trump Plaza in 1984, when he described it as the finest building in Atlantic City - and possibly the nation. But he cut ties several years ago, and last month filed a lawsuit to get his name taken off of it.

Despite its prime location at the heart of the Boardwalk, gamblers have been abandoning Trump Plaza - which has seen better days - for newer, ritzier casinos for years. 

Its owners, Trump Entertainment Resorts, allowed the casino to deteriorate, particularly after a sale for the bargain-basement price of $20 million to a California firm fell through last year.

The parent company has  threatened to shutter the Trump Taj Mahal Casino resort in November, which has also been on a steady decline in recent years.

Showing some nostalgia for the old days, Mr Trump tweeted: 'It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City. So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport, convention center, etc.'

He added: 'Does anybody notice that Atlantic City lost its magic after I left years ago. I had the big boxing, introduced UFC (ask Dana),the best shows.'

Jim Redmond, 60, from Montreal adores Atlantic City and regularly stayed at Trump Plaza. He noted that the hotel and casino's decline was steady over the last seven years.

'It did slip every year,' he said. 'This year they had no bedspreads and they totally gave up on the ice machines.

'This year the Plaza bar was closed and the 24 hour cafe closed at 2 p.m. The higher-end restaurants were closed.

'It was so sad to see it get a little worse every year. They really seemed to give up about five years ago.'

Atlantic City began the year with 12 casinos. It now has eight. 

Dealer Ruth Hardrick worked at Trump Plaza for 26 of its 30 years, but is now without a job. 

She is one of the roughly 8,000 Atlantic City casino workers have lost their jobs this year, and another 3,000 could join them if Trump Taj Mahal also goes under.

'What's the next step? Where do we go from here?' she asked. 'It's happening all over. A lot of us are in the same boat. You think something will come along (to save the casino). And it didn't.'

Illuminated letters of the casino's name on the building's front and back facades burned out and were never replaced. Visitors to the Miss America pageant last week at Boardwalk Hall next door saw a neon sign proclaiming 'Trump Plaz Hotel & Cas.' On the Boardwalk side, the sign read, 'U Laza.'

Many restaurants on the first and third floors have been shut down for months. Along an escalator leading to them, fake plastic plants were either missing or stolen from row after row of trays. 

A self-serve kiosk to redeem player's club points near the parking garage was disconnected and covered in dust.

So far this year, Trump Plaza has taken in just $36.8 million from gamblers. The figure is down 31.5 per cent from the same period last year, and about the same amount as the Borgata casino wins during an average two-week period.

Things have changed since Mr Trump opened the casino in the summer of 1984. At the time he described it as the finest building in Atlantic City - and possibly the nation
