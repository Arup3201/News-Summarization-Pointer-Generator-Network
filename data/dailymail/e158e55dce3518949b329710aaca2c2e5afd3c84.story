Mexican officials have denied one of their helicopters flew into Arizona on Thursday, and blamed the gunfire on the drug smugglers they were tracking.

The U.S. had claimed earlier this week that the Mexican helicopter had crossed into Tucson and fired at two agents before going back across the border.

A border patrol spokesman said on Friday that Mexico had called to apologize for the incident, but the country's attorney-general's office has now changed tact.

A Mexican official disputed claims that the helicopter strayed into U.S. airspace, and said the crew were at least 100m away.

Tomas Zeron, director of the Mexican attorney general's investigative office, told CNN they were involved in an investigation 'on the border'.

'I do not think we crossed the border because we brought our navigation. But it was just 100 meters from the border.'

He blamed criminals for the shooting and said several were arrested after the incident, which came during an investigation into drug smuggling and people trafficking. 

Zeron also gave no indication that an apology for the shooting was needed, and said Mexican authorities had done nothing wrong.

Vivian McLoughlin, of the U.S. Border Patrol, had confirmed on Friday that the Mexican helicopter crossed the border at 5.45am on Thursday.

No further details were given by the border agency, but a spokesman said it was being investigated.

KVOA-TV reported the chopper fired over Tohono O’odham Indian Nation in the Arizona desert, before flying back to Mexico. The agents were not injured.

This was not the first time the Mexican military has veered across the international boundary.

In January, US border agents confronted two heavily armed Mexican soldiers who crossed 50 yards inside Arizona, the Los Angeles Times reported. A standoff ensued, but nobody was hurt.

In 2011, more than 30 uniformed Mexican soldiers in military vehicles crossed the Rio Grande without authorization in an incident that was believed to be inadvertent.

According to a recent Washington Times story, the US Department of Homeland Security says that Mexican police or troops have crossed over the border around 300 times during the last decade, and were armed in around half of those incidents.
