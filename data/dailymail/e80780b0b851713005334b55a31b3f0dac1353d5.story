Eliot Spitzer has refused to deny claims that he is cheating on his wife Silda - again.

The New York City comptroller candidate was given three opportunities this morning to defend himself against allegations he has a girlfriend, but instead chose to dodge reporters' questions.

'I am so tired of the personal attacks and I've answered all those questions,' he said at a Brooklyn campaign stop.

Spitzer spectacularly resigned from politics five years ago after admitting he regularly had sex with prostitutes, including Emperors Club VIP call girls Ashley Alexandra Dupré.

While his wife Silda, 55, stood by him, it has been reported she now plans to leave her husband as soon as the New York election is held in November. The couple also reportedly live apart.

Spitzer today tried to play down the fresh rumors about a new extra-marital tryst - telling reporters the public doesn't care about his love life.

'The public cares about what I did in government. That's what I'm going to be talking about and that's what the public is going to be voting on - based on what I did in terms of trying to clean up Wall Street, which got a lot more attention than the other things we did,' he said, according to the New York Post. 'But the other things we did was just as important.'

When the topic was raised again, Spitzer insisted voters weren't interested in his private affairs.

'We've
said everything we can say about that and these are attacks that are 
coming out of left field and frankly, you know, the public cares about 
what the public should care about. The public frankly is a lot smarter 
in this regard than some folks in the media,' he said.

When a reporter gave him a final chance to 'reject' the rumors, Spitzer said: 'I have said everything we're going to say about this.'

Spitzer's controversial comeback follows the 2008 revelation he had spent about $80,000 on prostitutes supplied by Emperors Club VIP madam Kristin Davis.

The married father of three daughters took call-girls, including his favorite Ashley Alexandra Dupré, to room 871 at the tony Mayflower Hotel in Washington D.C., paying about $1,000 per hour for his sexcapades.

Spitzer's extra-marital liaisons were revealed after Davis' illicit operation attracted the attention of federal law enforcement. They then caught Spitzer on a wiretap arranging a sex-for-pay session with Dupré.

'I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my - or any - sense of right or wrong,' Spitzer said in a short speech, after media reports identified him as a man referred to in court documents as 'Client 9.'

Spitzer resigned but never faced criminal charges because federal authorities determined he didn't use public money to fund his trysts.

Spitzer’s political comeback has been compared to that of New York mayoral contender Anthony Weiner, the married former U.S. 
congressman who resigned after sending racy photos of himself to several
women, including Sydney Leathers.
