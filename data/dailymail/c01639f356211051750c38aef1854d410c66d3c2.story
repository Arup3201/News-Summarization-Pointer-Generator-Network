Porsche have hit back at a lawsuit claiming negligence and poor design caused the 2013 crash that killed Paul Walker, saying the sole cause of the accident was  the dangerous driving of the man behind the wheel, Roger Rodas.

The luxury car-maker is demanding the lawsuit, which was filed by Kristine Rodas - the widow of Roger Rodas - be thrown out of court.

Mrs Rodas filed the suit last year, claiming the $500,000 red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT her husband was driving, along with Walker as passenger, had a faulty suspension.

She claimed Rodas tried to keep the car on the road, but could not regain control. 

She also claimed that a 'properly functioning crash cage' would have prevented the deaths.

Lawsuit: The widow of Roger Rodas, who died alongside Paul Walker in a car crash in November 2013, is suing Porsche, claiming negligence and poor design caused the crash. Porsche have now hit back, saying the crash was caused solely by Rodas

The car crashed into a concrete lamppost and two trees in Valencia, California, on November 30, 2013, killing both Rodas and Walker.

Mrs Rodas also blames Porsche for the car exploding on impact, claiming the vehicle lacked a proper 'crash cage' and a 'racing fuel cell.' 

Furthermore, she accused Porsche of ignoring multiple fatal crashes that occurred in the model and never took steps to warn their customers. She filed the federal lawsuit for damages due to their actions

However, on March 30, Porsche fired back at the Rodas lawsuit, claiming they are not at fault for her husbands death, and it was solely the result of his own actions while driving their car

The car company denies all allegations the car model had defects or that they were aware of them.

Porsche is demanding the lawsuit be dismissed and Rodas be awarded not a dime from her legal battle. 

They state that 'Roger Rodas death, and all other injuries or damages claimed, were the result of Roger Rodas' own comparative fault'.

They also say Rodas knowingly and voluntarily assumed all risk, perils and danger in respect to the operation of the Porsche Carrera GT, and that 'he choose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose himself to the dangers while operating the vehicle'.

The company also says the car was altered following the original sale, and that the alterations contributed to the deadly crash.

They also accuse Rodas of misusing and/or improperly maintaining the car.  

When Kristine Rodas filed the lawsuit last year, TMZ reported she claimed the fuel cell prevents fuel from igniting upon impact and is a feature often found in race cars.

Kristine claims that Porsche did not warn customers of multiple fatal crashes that have happened in the Carrera GT.

She quotes them as saying the model is 'as close to a racecar as we will ever get'.

TMZ reported, adding that she has hired Hollywood lawyer Mark Geragos.

Final film: Walker, seen here in a scene from Furious 7, which is released this week, died mid-way during filming of the movie. His brothers, Caleb and Cody Walker were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes
