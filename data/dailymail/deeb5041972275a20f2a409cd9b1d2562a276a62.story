CLICK HERE to sign up for MailOnline Fantasy Football and start managing your team ahead of the new Premier League season, which begins on August 16. 

As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

REMY CABELLA IN A NUTSHELL

Cabella is a 24-year-old French international who can play as an attacking midfielder, winger or wide forward.

He has signed for Newcastle United from Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier, where he scored 28 times in 115 matches, in order to provide some much needed creativity to Alan Pardew's side.

At £12million, he has become Newcastle's most expensive signing in nine years but he looks good value for money as Pardew looks to strengthen a squad which struggled last season.

Creative: Remy Cabella has shown himself to be a player who provides assists and score goals from midfield 

New arrival: Newcastle completed the £12million signing of Remy Cabella from Montpellier this summer

Flair: Cabella has been labelled the 'New Ginola' due to his creativity and ability on the ball

Last season Cabella scored 14 times in 37 games in Ligue 1 for un-fancied side Montpellier.

He also provided five assists for his team-mates over the course of the league campaign and received an impressive nine Man of the Match awards, while having 2.7 shots per match.

His pass success rate - at 79.8% - was quite high for an attacking midfielder best known for his trickery and ability to get to the byline and cross the ball in.

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE CABELLA IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

Points are what Fantasy Football is all about - and Cabella should provide them in abundance on Tyneside this season.

Newcastle lacked creativity towards the end of last season and Pardew has put his faith in the Corsican-born midfielder to provide some much needed attacking oompf to his side.

The Frenchman is full of tricks and flicks - and has been compared to Toon legend David Ginola and Ballon D'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo in the past - and he loves to provide an assist, with five last season.

He was also awarded nine Man of the Match awards, meaning he accrued further points as a result. However, most impressively he added goals to his game in 2013.

A return of 14 goals from 37 league matches is extremely high for a midfielder - especially one who will cost just £5.9m in Fantasy Football.

THE GAME CABELLA PROVED HIS WORTH IN

It's early doors for Cabella at Newcastle but the striker has impressed in parts during his two pre-season outings for the Toon.

In his first match against Malaga he struggled to get into a game which Newcastle lost 3-1 - but his next appearance against Schalke was extremely impressive.

The midfielder arrived off the bench after 57 minutes and made a huge impact, scoring in the 72nd-minute with a classy run and finish to make the score 3-0.

In fact, Cabella was so impressive he was given the Man of the Match award. Newcastle fans will have been licking their lips after seeing this cameo.

Making an early impact: Cabella has played twice in pre-season and has already won a Man of the Match award

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Newcastle boss Pardew was effusive in his praise for his new signing.

The Toon manager said: 'We've worked really hard on this and he's a player we think is important, which is represented in the fee and represented in his commitment to us. I'm just looking forward to seeing an exciting talent.

'He's a player who has been on our radar for a while and he is a marquee signing for us. He represents for us all Newcastle fans love in a player. 

'He has flair but also real hard work and commitment. He will bring talent to St James' Park I hope our fans really enjoy.' 

French journalist Julien Laurens was also full of praise for Cabella when he spoke to the Chronicle. 

He said: 'The most common thing that is said about him is that he's very much like Ginola. This is because it's true and because he gets the fans excited.

'He is very similar to what Ginola was when he was 24. He is a wonderful player and he is someone that the supporters will certainly enjoy watching.'

HE'S A BETTER, CHEAPER VERSION OF... LOADS OF PREMIER LEAGUE MIDFIELDERS

At £5.9m Cabella is the 87th most expensive striker in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game, despite his brilliant scoring record in France last season and his ability to accrue plenty of points.

That means that a mind-boggling 86 midfielders cost more than Cabella. He is a budget buy who can add some valuable points to your side for a relatively small price. 

Just a few of the players that the 24-year-old is cheaper and arguably better than are...

Mohamed Salah (Chelsea) - £7.2m

Hatem Ben Arfa (Newcastle United) - £6.7m

Aaron Lennon (Tottenham Hotspur) - £6.6m

Nani (Manchester United) - £6.6m 

Wayne Routledge (Swansea City) - £6.3m

Gaston Ramirez (Southampton) - £6.2m  

Laughing all the way to the bank: If you choose Cabella in your team, you will be getting a bargain buy
