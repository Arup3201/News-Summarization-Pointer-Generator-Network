Sarah Collins Rudolph said she has forgiven the people who carried out the 1963 atrocity in which she lost her sister and one of her eyes

A key point in the Civil Rights movement happened 50 years ago when four young black girls were killed after the Ku Klux Klan bombed a church in Birmingham, Alabama.

The girls' deaths shocked the nation and was instrumental in the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

On Friday, President Obama signed a law to honor the victims of the bombing - 14-year-olds Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise McNair - with the Congressional Gold Medal.

One of the survivors of the blast was Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie was killed.

Despite losing her sister and also one of her eyes as a result of the blast, she had told CBS News that she no longer feels bitterness about the incident.

‘Being bitter won't bring the girls back, won't bring my sight back. So I had to forgive because it was what God wanted me to do,’ she said.

During the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the 16th Baptist Church served as an organizational headquarters for blacks protesting institutionalized racism in the South. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a frequent speaker there.

On Sunday, September 15, 1963, the Ku Klux Klan planted dynamite outside the church blowing a gaping hole in the wall and killing the four girls, who were in the bathroom.

Mrs. Rudolph was showered with debris and flying glass from the blast and spent nearly three months in hospital. Doctors also had to remove her right eye.

She now wears a prosthesis and still has pieces of glass in her left eye.

While she has learned to forgive with time, the past 50 years have been tough for Mrs. Rudolp. 

‘When I would go to bed at night, I would just cry all night long, just why did they kill those girls,’ she said.

‘Addie never did anything for someone to kill her.’

President Obama signed a bill into law on Friday granting the United States' highest civilian honor to the four girls killed in 1963.

‘They gave their all,’ said U.S. Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and influential civil rights leader.

‘This medal will serve as a compelling reminder of the sacrifices so many freedom fighters made to help us achieve equality and social change,’ Terri Sewell, an Alabama Democrat, and one of the bill's sponsors, said in a statement.

In 1963, Alabama was the center of a non-violent civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King and others that was met with violence from the Ku Klux Klan and state and local officials trying to enforce racial segregation laws.

‘The civil rights victories were achieved by the principles of non-violence. Love carried the day against hate,’ Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican, who also sponsored the bill.

On Friday President Barack Obama signed a bill designating the Congressional Gold Medal commemorating the lives of the four young girls killed

Scheduled to attend the White House signing ceremony were Birmingham Mayor William Bell and Doug Jones, a former prosecutor who finally brought the last two church bombers to justice in 2001 and 2002. Also attending were family members of Denise McNair and Carole Robertson.

‘We feel that this honor given by Congress means that our great country recognizes the sacrifices made for freedom in our country,’ Lisa McNair, the 49-year-old sister of Denise McNair, told Reuters.

But the families of Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley have criticized the medals as useless symbolism for families who received little compensation for an atrocious act.

‘They were murdered. I am not going to go get the Congressional Medal until justice has been fulfilled. I want restitution,’ Mrs. Rudolph told Reuters. She has asked for $5 million in compensation as a victim of terrorism.

The medals are to be awarded at a Congressional ceremony later this year and will be displayed in the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.
