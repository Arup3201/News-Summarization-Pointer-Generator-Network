Former Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre last week caused consternation when he accused the Manchester City of 'buying trophies' and 'shutting the door' to young talent.

However, the Frenchman's remarks were greeted with wry smiles by the powers-that-be at the Etihad Stadium, for Silvestre actually pleaded to cross the divide and join City in the summer of 2010.

After spending two years with Arsenal, the curtain was coming down on Silvestre's career when he approached City to offer his services.

Silvestre, for nine years a player at Old Trafford between 1999 and 2008, made the remarks at a promotional event in his role as a United ambassador in the United States last week.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, a Manchester City insider said: 'Silvestre came to us when his contract had expired at Arsenal and asked if we would be interested in signing him.

'In fact, he was a bit desperate about it. It was a touch embarrassing to see a former United player in such obvious need of a final pay day.

'There was never any chance of Silvestre coming to City, of course, but it seems he's now got an ace to grind.

'We read his comments about Manchester City with a mixture of surprise and amusement, given they were made by a player who made it clear he was happy to come and play for a club he apparently has no respect for if we paid his wages.

'There used to be a time when it was said that City spoke more about United than their own club - but it seems the opposite is true now.

'It would be interesting to see if Mikel Silvestre is aware of the money both Manchester clubs have spent in the transfer market during 2014. He might be surprised.'
