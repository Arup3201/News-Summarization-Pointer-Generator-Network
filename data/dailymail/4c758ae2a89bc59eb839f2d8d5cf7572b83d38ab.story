A wealthy property developer is being taken to court after refusing to tear down a giant £2,500 playhouse he built in his back garden for his children.

Jeffrey Morris, 40, and his wife Louise Cook, 45, erected the 12ft wooden playhouse in the grounds of their £800,000 home in the Northamptonshire village of Horton for their young daughters.

When neighbours complained their properties were overlooked, they dismantled it and put it back up without a wooden platform, but they were told they were still in breach of planning law and had to take it down.

Mr Morris says that he has complied with the issues raised at the start but believes the council 'wants a scalp'

The problem began two years ago when the Morris family bought the playhouse for their 300ft back garden.

South Northamptonshire Council complained the structure, which 11ft high, 19ft wide and 9ft deep, caused 'significant harm to the character and appearance of the area' and ordered it to be removed.

The couple complied and rebuilt the house without its wooden platform but were told it still breached planning law and given an enforcement notice ordering them to remove the playhouse, which consists of a swing set, slide and tree house.

When the couple refused to comply, they refused they were ordered to Northampton Magistrates' Court, where they denied breaching an enforcement notice.

Mr Morris told magistrates: 'The supplier Leisure Time Products confirmed to us we didn’t need planning permission because the full height was under four metres and the planning officer said the same.

'We proceeded on that basis and eight months went by.

'It was only when neighbours began to criticise South Northamptonshire Council for not doing their job well enough that the council looked into it again.'

Mr Morris says the firm he bought the playhouse from in 2011 told him it did not require planning permission

If they lose the case they could face a maximum £20,000 fine plus court costs and still be forced to rip the playhouse down.

The couple claim they were told by planning officers during site visits that the platform was the only issue, but that after taking it apart, making several adjustments and reassembling it, the officers said they had still breached the enforcement notice.

Mr Morris, who lives has lived in the detached stone house since 2005 with his wife and their three children, Charlie, 20, Amelia, 12, and Poppy, nine, said:  'We were assured by the company that the playhouse did not require planning permission and it was up for 11 months before someone complained to the council.

'The platform was the floor of the 
little treehouse bit of the structure so to show good faith we took the 
floor out but now the council claim the ledge near the slide constitutes
 a platform.

'A planning officer bizarrely told me one way to comply with planning law would be to build a large shed covering the playhouse to make it an indoor play area which did not need planning permission.

'It’s crazy because that would mean building something even bigger.'

Mr Morris added: 'In my view the council are desperate for a scalp and because we are property developers they have come after us and are using bully tactics to make us tear it down.

'At the court hearing the council officers told me they would pursue the maximum £20,000 fine plus court costs.

'I refuse to take this lying down and I will not be bullied so I am putting my money where my mouth is and will fight them because I know I am in the right.'

A trial will take place in March next year at Wellingborough Magistrates’ Court.

A spokesman for South Northamptonshire Council said the construction of garden sheds, garages, tree houses, and play equipment was allowed without planning permission if they didn't have a balcony or raised platform over 300mm, had only a single storey, and if were more than two metres from a boundary if over 2.5m high.

He said: 'The development in Horton did not comply with any of these criteria.'

Councillor Rebecca Breese said: 'The council has consistently informed the applicant that the structure was unauthorised and required planning permission.

'[The council's] enforcement notice has not been complied with, despite repeated requests to do so and left the council with no other option but to prosecute the site owner.'
