The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014.

But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power.

Now, as the comet approaches the sun and solar rays recharge Philae's batteries, Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin tells MailOnline he is confident of finding the probe soon - but it will be a race against time to get it working again.

He warned that once the comet begins heading away from the sun in August it will enter hibernation again - but this time for good. 

Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told MailOnline he is confident of making contact with Philae on comet 67P soon (approach of lander on 12 November shown). The probe has been silent since it ran out of power in November, and Esa scientists in Germany recently failed to make contact

Last week, experts at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) abandoned an eight-day attempt to find the probe - the first attempt at trying to restart communications since it went dark.

Philae only had a limited battery supply when it landed, lasting just 60 hours before it ran out of energy.

The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P.

It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014.

After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet.

But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet.

This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude.

It managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta is continuing to orbit and study the comet.

Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. 

But it is covered in solar panels and, as the comet approaches the sun, it is expected to get enough power - 19 watts - from its panels to make contact with the orbiting Rosetta spacecraft.

There will be several windows of opportunity as Rosetta makes its way around the comet for the two unmanned spacecraft to talk to each other. 

The next of these will be on 13 April.

Making contact will enable scientists to get Philae to continue the groundbreaking science it managed to perform in its brief operational time on the surface - and it will also allow Rosetta to pinpoint its location.

Speaking about the attempt to find the probe last week, Mr Martin told MailOnline: ‘We were trying to see if the lander would wake up and, at the same time, we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation.

‘We don’t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander.’

The main issue at the moment is that, for the lander simply to wake up, it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45°C (-49°F).

But to start communicating with Rosetta again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power.

It may have already reached the former level, which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we won’t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter.

This image sent back from Philae revealed its precarious position on the comet. It appears the probe is partially wedged against a cliff, with some of its solar panels shrouded in darkness. But this did not stop it from completing more than 90 per cent of its science goals in 60 hours of operation on the surface

Philae, pictured left by Rosetta on its approach to comet 67P on 12 November, needs 19 watts of power in order to communicate with Earth through Rosetta. Mission manager Mr Martin, pictured right, said they had already sent commands to the lander, some of which it may have carried out

The landing of Philae on 67P was a groundbreaking moment not only for Esa, but for spaceflight as a whole. It marked the first time a probe had successfully landed on a comet. Shown are some of the team celebrating when news of the successful landing was received back at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany

‘It’s a very complex configuration,’ explained Mr Martin.

‘The lander has to be able to communicate with the orbiter, and at the same time we are hoping to have enough energy and solar illumination for the lander to wake up.’

At the next attempt, Martin said there was a ’50:50 chance’ they would hear something from Philae, but even if that attempt is unsuccessful he is very confident that we will have heard something from Philae by the time 67P makes its closest approach to the sun - known as perihelion - in August.

By this time, temperatures will almost certainly be sufficient for its solar panels to generate enough power for the probe to continue performing experiments on the surface.

When it wakes up, Mr Martin said his team would ‘check the situation of the lander and all its units, try to understand what has happened since November, and then as quickly as possible start the long term science phase.’

The goal of this long term science phase is to ‘understand better the comet’s surface, the area where the lander has landed,' he added.

‘If the lander wakes up, I’m sure we would try to use all or most of the instruments.’

Shown here are Rosetta and the Philae lander, in the centre, before they took off from Earth in 2004. Philae’s power system included a non-rechargeable 1,000 watt-hour primary battery and a secondary 140 watt-hour battery, charged by the 24 square feet (2.2 square metres) of solar panels on its exterior

Scientists are desperate to study  the jets that are being emitted by the comet in more detail - one is seen in this Rosetta image - as it approaches the sun. And Philae will play a big part in increasing our understanding of how this process takes place, if Esa is able to wake it up in a reasonable amount of time

But while they are confident Philae will wake up, scientists will be hoping it happens sooner rather than later as it will not be able to operate indefinitely on the comet.

After August, 67P will begin its journey away from the sun, and temperatures on the comet will begin to drop.

‘After the summer we start getting more away from the sun, so there will be a point where it will happen again, and then the lander will go into hibernation,’ Mr Martin said.

Ultimately, once the influx of solar rays drops sufficiently, Philae will turn off for good.

Even though the comet has a relatively short orbital period, 6.45 years, it's unlikely Rosetta and Philae will survive long enough to continue communicating with Earth on its return.

Some comets' orbital periods lasts thousands of years.  

In addition, perhaps the most interesting time to study the comet will be as it approaches the sun, and ice on its surface begins to vapourise into gas.

If Philae can study and observe the comet on the approach, it could provide some fascinating insight into what happens to a comet during this phase.

However, they want to find it before the comet leaves the sun in August

After this, the probe will eventually run out of power - this time forever

The team wants to perform as much science as possible before then
