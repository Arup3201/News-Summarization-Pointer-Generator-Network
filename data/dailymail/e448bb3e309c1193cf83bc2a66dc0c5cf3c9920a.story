Jaydon Gibbs can pinpoint the exact moment he knew his twin brother Kieran would make it big.

The pair were representing Croydon Schools when their manager, David O'Brien, confidently predicted that the youngest of the Gibbs brothers would become a Premier League star. Considering they were just '13 or 14' at the time, it turned out to be some foresight.

But Gibbs Junior wasn't always the most talented footballer in the family. 'He hates me talking about this,' says Jaydon, who is preparing to face Rochdale in the second round of the FA Cup on Sunday with Vanarama Conference side Aldershot.

'We were about 10 or 11 and on trial at a club called Tandridge. I got picked and he didn't but my mum had a word with the coach and asked if they could take us both as we were twins.'

The club listened to the boys' mother and Kieran hasn't looked back since, having gone on to establish himself as a key member of Arsenal's back-four and a part of Roy Hodgson's England plans.

Jaydon's path to the professional game hasn't been as straightforward as his sibling, who was born 45 minutes after him in Lambeth, south London. After being released by the Gunners at 15, he spent six months at Leyton Orient before falling out of love with the game and quitting.

'I decided that if I wasn't at Arsenal then I didn't really want to play football,' he says. 'I just wanted to do what my mates were doing - getting jobs and going out.'

His desire to forge a career for himself returned through spells in non-league with Guildford City and Chipstead before the opportunity to play full-time for The Shots was offered to him in August, 2013. This weekend's game against League One Dale is arguably the biggest of his career, particularly given the potential prize on offer.

'It's always in the back of your mind that you could be facing a Premier League team or a side from the Championship,' he says cautiously.

'The dream tie for me would be Arsenal but that's a long way away. We've got to get the result on Sunday and we don't want to look too far ahead. The boys are buzzing for it.'

Victory for Andy Scott's side at the ESS Stadium would create the possibility of a third round meeting with Arsene Wenger's FA Cup holders, a fixture which would almost certainly see left back Kieran go head-to-head with right back Jaydon.

'I don't think my mum would like it, especially given the positions we play!' he says with a hint of seriousness.

'When we both played at Arsenal we didn't really like tackling each other and we always looked out for each other. He's still my little brother so I don't think I'd be able to hit him with one of my Conference-style tackles!

'I think he's more excited about the prospect of playing me than I am about playing him but we've still got that brotherly competition. If I came up against Kieran then I'd just have to treat it like facing any other opponent.

'For that 90 minutes we wouldn't be family, just players on opposing teams. I'm sure he'd be the same.'

But who would come out on top? 'That's a dangerous question! I wouldn't mind a little running race with him at the moment. I'm the fittest I've ever been so it would probably be pretty close.'

Originally an attack-minded winger, Jaydon dropped into defence at the start of the previous campaign and has made the position his own with a little help from his younger sibling.

'Last season our right back got injured and I saw that there were only attacking players on the bench,' he recalls. 'I put my hand up and told the manager that I could do a job there and 52 games later I haven't moved.

'I just try and watch his (Kieran's) games and learn from the way he does things. The Premier League is hugely different to the Conference - they get so much time on the ball. I ask for pointers and just try to take as much on board as I can.

'Kieran has been to watch me play more times this season than I've watched him. He loves it down here and he has come out with the boys at the weekend too. He really watches the games and tells me a lot when he get home.'

Home for the Gibbs brothers is a house, or as Jaydon describes it 'a bachelor pad', in north London. They've lived together since moving out of their family home at the age of 19 and now spend much of their free time together, although that wasn't always the case.

'We didn't even walk to school together when we were younger!' he reveals with a laugh.

'I was a bit more naughty at school and he was more reserved. We didn't always see eye-to-eye but we had the same mates. It wasn't until we got a bit older that we became closer.

'I think he was a bit nervous as he came through at Arsenal and he didn't really have anyone to confide in. That's where I came in and we've been inseparable ever since.

'We both get in from training in the afternoon. I make dinner and he does the washing up. We watch TV, play FIFA and pool - typical brother stuff. We've got mates round all the time, too.'

Kieran often shuns the limelight which comes with being a top-flight footballer but Jaydon freely admits that things might be very different if he'd been the one to graduate from Arsenal's academy and into the public's consciousness.

'I think this interview would be very different!' he jokes. 'The fame went to the right one of us. Kieran is a model professional and I'm not just saying that because he is my brother.

'He's a role model for anyone wanting to become a footballer. I'd probably be on the front page of the paper rather than the back!'

He did make headlines back in May, 2012, when he unwittingly played international football for the Principality of Sealand, an unrecognised self-declared state located on a British-built platform in the North Sea.

'I didn't know what it was all about,' he says, the surprise still evident in his voice. 'My brother's agent asked me if I'd like to be involved and I thought it was a charity game.

'I thought it was weird when they played the national anthems at the start and afterwards someone told me I'd earned international honours! It's a bit of a shame as it might have ruined by England hopes.

Whilst Kieran has lifted the FA Cup, success for Jaydon would be to reach the third round of the competition

'Actor Ralf Little and someone from the band McFly played too. I couldn't believe it. I don't really shout about it but it's on my CV.'

While playing for Sealand was just a bit of fun, Jaydon is now completely concentrated on the game he once walked away from. Playing at the highest level possible is his aim, with a return to the Football League with Aldershot a realistic goal.

‘I'm not getting any younger now and if I'm going to get back into the league then it's going to have to be soon,’ he says. ‘It'd be great to do it with Aldershot, we've got a great set-up here.'

This weekend his focus is on the FA Cup, a competition his brother won with Arsenal just six-and-a-half months ago. Success for Jaydon and his team-mates would simply be reaching the third round.
