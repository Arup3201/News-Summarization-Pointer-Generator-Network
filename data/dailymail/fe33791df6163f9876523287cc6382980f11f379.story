Just a few months ago this baby elephant was found alone and on the brink of starvation after being separated from its herd.

But now this adorable calf has made an incredible recovery after being rescued by a charity for orphaned elephants in Malawi.

Baby elephant Moses, named after another famous abandoned calf, has been adopted by the Jumbo Foundation where he is being raised by humans.

New home: A seven-and-a-half month old orphaned elephant calf named Moses cuddles his adoptive mother and Jumbo Foundation owner, Jenny Webb, at their home in Lilongwe, Malawi

Dinner time: Moses drinking one of his two-hourly formula bottle feeds

Sweet dreams: Moses in a makeshift bed with Jenny Webb as the baby elephant won't sleep alone

The foundation described the heart-breaking moment abandoned Moses was found in February this year when he was just a week old by rangers at Vwaza Wildlife Reserve.

A post on the foundation website blog says: 'Rangers at Vwaza Wildlife Reserve noticed a baby elephant on his own running around frantically trying to find his mother. The rangers monitored the baby and tried to locate the herd he belonged to without success.'

A few days later, the rangers spotted the calf again in the South Rukuru River and his condition had deteriorated so much he was too weak to get out of the water.

It continued: 'The rangers then decided to intervene and rescued the baby.

'Various parks and wildlife organizations were contacted and nobody was in a position to take the elephant.'

Jumbo Foundation owner, Jenny Webb, was contacted about the baby calf and agreed to take on custody of the elephant on behalf of the National Parks and Wildlife.

He had just a 20 per cent chance of survival but that has now risen to 50 per cent after several months at the sanctuary.

She began feeding him a foal milk formula as elephants don't start eating solids until they are eight months old.

Ms Webb also sleeps on a mattress next to the baby elephant as he won't sleep without having some form of contact similar to what he would have had with his mother in the wild.

The orphaned elephants are raised at the foundation in Lilongwe, Malawi, in a way to ensure that they are physically and physiologically able to be released back into the wild.

Elephants need to live as part of a herd and other animals can make a good substitute.

So Moses now also has several new friends - primarily two pet dogs at the sanctuary, Barney and Bagheera.
