For many women, it's the tell-tale signs of aging around their eyes and their mouth they wish they could banish.

However, for Christine Hockney, 58, from Southampton, it was wrinkle-free ears she longed for.

The mother-of-one said damage caused by wearing large earrings when she was younger had left her with older-looking ears.

BEFORE: The wrinkly ear, which affected Christine's self-esteem

AFTER: Her lobe back to its former puffy self after being injected with filler

And she was delighted when she found the answer to her problem – eartox.

The 
treatment, officially known as ‘ear rejuvenation’, eliminates lines from 
the earlobes and restores them to their youthful puffy selves.

Christine says: ‘I felt that my earlobes were old, and I felt very self-conscious about it.

‘My ears had lost volume due to the natural aging process and I also had a really strong wrinkle line running vertically down my lobe to the point where my ears had been pierced.

‘It was always visible no matter what type of earrings I wore and I could only wear small, light studs, as anything heavier would look like it was dropping out my ear.

‘It not 
only meant I could no longer wear the earrings I loved, it also affected
 the way I could wear my hair and my confidence.’

It was Dr Carolyn Berry, a Southampton-based cosmetic doctor, who offered Christine the treatment. 

‘The lobe is injected with filler in several areas and inflates, but it then looks better immediately,’ Dr Berry explains.

The hydrophilic filler draws fluid into it, which causes further inflation and makes the tissue appear softer and more hydrated.

'Eartox' may seem an odd route to beauty, but Christine says: 'We all have our thing.'

And she couldn’t be happier with her new voluminous lobes.

‘The procedure was painless and very comfortable, there were no after-effects, no pain or swelling,' she says.

‘I’m not sure anyone else will notice I’ve had it had done, but it affected my self-esteem and I now feel like my whole face is the same age. 

‘I can also wear my hair up and feel confident that I have younger looking, rejuvenated earlobes. And I can wear fabulous earrings again.

‘I’ve always loved accessorising outfits. I even used to buy the earrings first and then find an outfit to match. 

‘In the Eighties and Nineties I wore the massive, heavy earring, which were fashionable at the time. Little did I realise the consequences decades later.'
