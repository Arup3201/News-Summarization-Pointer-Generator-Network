A flight attendants' union is trying to overturn rules allowing airplane passengers to use cellphones and other device during take-off and landing.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) changed its guidance last year, allowing passengers to use their devices freely while flying.

But the Association of Flight Attendants says the agency didn't follow procedure when they made the change - and also that letting passengers keep cellphones on is distracting and could be dangerous.

But their arguments made little impression at the U.S. Court of Appeals, who said that the call is - and always has been - one for airlines to make, rather than the government.

Although the three-judge panel, sitting in Washington, D.C., has yet to deliver a written warning, they seemed to suggest the union, which has 60,000 members, will not succeed.

Judge Harry T. Edwards told one of the union lawyers: 'Airlines have always had discretion on how to handle this.'

The FAA announced late last year that it was changing guidance that had for years resulted in passengers stowing cellphones, tablets, and music and video players during takeoffs and landings. 

Under new guidance, airlines can let passengers use them at any point as long as the plane is protected from electronic interference and the airlines get the FAA's approval. 

Restrictions: The FAA relaxed its guidance last year, freeing millions of passengers to use their phones

Cellphones still must be in airplane mode when in use.

Since the announcement, the FAA has cleared 31 airline operators to let their passengers use the devices they want. Between them the operators carry around 96 per cent of U.S. fliers.

Union lawyer Amanda Dure told the judges that 'anyone who has been on a plane in the last year has seen a huge change.'

But she argued that in relaxing the rules, officials violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act.

Other devices: Items including tablets, music players and video players are also covered by the rules

The act requires government agencies to give the public notice and the ability to comment when a rule is changed. That didn't happen properly, the union argues.

Judge Janice Rogers Brown asked about the flight attendants' concern that allowing passengers to keep out electronics leaves 'more things to fly around' the airplane cabin during turbulence.

But a lawyer for the government, Jeffrey Sandberg, told the judges that cellphones and other small devices are no more dangerous than books that passengers have always been allowed to keep out.

The government argued in court documents that the judges hearing the case don't have authority to review the issue and that the FAA's action didn't trigger public notice and comment requirements. 

The FAA did request and receive public feedback before updating its guidance, and considered 1,000 responses including one from the union, attorneys wrote.

Still, the government said the FAA merely told the airlines its opinion on the matter - which has always in fact been a decision for the individual companies.
