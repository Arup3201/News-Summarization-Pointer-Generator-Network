Armed robber John Cadby broke out of prison in a desperate bid to see his cancer-stricken grandson fearing he might never see him again

An armed robber who broke out of prison in a desperate bid to see his cancer-stricken grandson has been jailed for just six more months after a judge said his case was 'exceptional'.

John Cadby scaled a 10ft wall after being denied home leave to visit the toddler.

The child's family were considering sending him to America for treatment and Cadby feared he would never see the 22-month-old again, a court heard.

Cadby, of no fixed address, spent 11 days on the run after escaping from HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire on January 21.

He was serving a six-year sentence imposed in October 2010 for a botched robbery in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham.

On that occasion, police responding to reports of a man armed with an axe in Boldmere Road restrained Cadby after he jumped into a passing car and ordered the terrified driver to help him flee.

Cadby, who was recaptured at a house in Tile Cross, Birmingham, admitted escaping from custody at Birmingham Crown Court.

But he received only an extra six months in jail after Judge Stuart Rafferty QC decided the case was 'exceptional'.

The judge told Cadby: 'I accept entirely that it had weighed heavily on your mind that your grandson was ill and may go to America and you may never see him again.'

The court heard Cadby had also been sent to the higher-security Birmingham Prison after he was tracked down.

Warren Stanier, prosecuting, said Cadby escaped after grappling with a guard at Sudbury, an open prison.

Anthony Potter, defending, said his grandson had been at Birmingham Children's Hospital since last October.

The boy had a particularly aggressive form of cancer and it had been proposed to send him to the U.S., Mr Potter added.

He said Cadby's request for home leave had been refused before he took the 'stupid' decision to escape.

Sudbury hit the headlines in June, 2011 when it emerged more than 100 criminals had escaped in the previous four years.
