Tributes from music stars flooded in today after the death of former Primal Scream guitarist, Robert 'Throb' Young.

The musician was found dead in his flat in Fourth Avenue, Hove, at 3.30pm on Tuesday.

Young was one of the Scottish band's founding members - originally playing the bass on their debut record Sonic Flower Groove, released in 1987.

He left the band after the release of their eighth studio album, Riot City Blues, in 2006.

Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie and Andrew Innes released a touching tribute calling Young their 'brother' who was a 'true rock and roller'.

The statement read: 'We have lost our comrade and brother Robert Young. A beautiful and deeply soulful man.

'He was an irreplaceable talent, much admired amongst his peers. In the words of Johnny Marr 'Throb with a gold top Les Paul - unbeatable. 

'He was a true rock and roller. He walked the walk. He had "Heart & Soul" tattooed on his arm and I'm sure on his heart too.

'He once said to me, "When we go on stage it's a war between us and the audience". He never let go of that attitude.

'Our love and thoughts are with his sons Brandon and Miles and their mother Jane, his wife Rachel, and his immediate family.'  

A further message was written on a Primal Scream message board by bass player Gary 'Mani' Mountfield, who played in both the Stone Roses and Primal Scream.

He said: 'Robert Young , AKA the Throb, passed away this weekend in Hove. Truly devastating news.'

Young joined Primal Scream originally as a bassist, before switching to guitar after the release of their debut album Sonic Flower Groove and the departure of guitarist Jim Beattie.

The band were famed for their hedonistic attitude to life and in 2006 Young took a 'sabbatical' from the band and did not return. 

Speaking at the time, lead singer Bobby Gillespie, said: 'Let's just say that he's got some problems that he's got to sort out for himself.

'It's a hard thing to talk about, because it's private and it's his life, and I don't think I have the right to judge him.

'I'd like Throbert to be alive. I'd like him to be well. I'd like him to be happy. Further than that I can't really say. I just hope he wants to get better.'

And in a later interview in 2013 with Drowned in Sound, when Gillespie was asked whether he might ever again work with Young, he said: 'No, it's never gonna happen again.

'That moment has passed. I don't want to get into the reasons but things turned out how they did.

'He went one way and we went another way.

'He stopped making music and we carried on making music. You just have to get on with your life.

'Robert Young's an incredible musician, an incredible talent.

'One of the most talented people I've ever known. I grew up with Robert and I love him like a brother, but we don't see him any more.

'I don't think anybody does. I don't really know what's happening there. I don't think he's making music now. But I wish he was because he's super talented.'

Sussex police confirmed that Young was found dead at his flat.

A spokesman said: 'Police were called to a report of a man who was found dead in a flat in Hove at 3.30pm on Tuesday (September 9).

'He has been identified as Robert Young, 49, of Hove. His death is not being treated as suspicious.'
