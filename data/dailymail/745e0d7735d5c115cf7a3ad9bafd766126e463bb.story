Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said that low interest rates are here to stay

The Bank of England’s new governor Mark Carney is expected to confirm that interest rates will remain at historic lows, in a radical break from tradition.

The Canadian is expected to make the unprecedented commitment - a bonus for borrowers but condemned as a disaster for savers - on Wednesday when he presents his first monthly inflation report since taking over from Lord King last month. 

The new policy, dubbed ‘forward guidance’, was used by Carney in his previous job as governor of the Bank of Canada.  

But it has never been used before for interest rates in the British central bank’s 300 year history.The aim will be to reassure investors, businesses and households across Britain that interest rates will be frozen for some time to come.

It comes amid growing fears that a sudden rise in interest rates could tip many households and businesses around the country over the edge.  

The Bank estimates that if rates were to rise from 0.5pc to just 2.5pc and incomes remained “subdued”, households with about £240 billion of mortgage debt would “experience financial difficulties”.

Interest rates were slashed to a record low of 0.5pc in March 2009 in a bid to provide breathing space for borrowers grappling with the most severe financial crisis in living memory. 

Last month the Bank signalled its intention, stating that expectations that interest rates would rise from their current level in the next two years were ‘not warranted’.

This marked an attempt to put some distance between developments in the US and Britain.

The Federal Reserve has indicated that its support for the US economy through quantitative easing may be coming to an end – pushing up interest rates on the financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Chancellor George Osborne ordered the Bank to report back on introducing forward guidance as a new weapon in its armoury to steer the economy back to full health. 

Experts last night described the new policy as great for borrowers but an ‘unmitigated disaster’ for savers.

David Buik, a veteran City commentator from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘The Bank wants to make sure that any rates movement are not a surprise to businesses and customers. It wants them to be put on notice– so they can take care of their financial affairs.’

But he added: ‘It’s a very  good thing for borrowers , but for savers it’s an unmitigated disaster.’

A combination of rate cuts on savings accounts and high inflation has cost savers more than £220 billion, according to campaign group Save Our Savers. 

Its spokesman Simon Rose said: ‘Low interest rates have not boosted the economy in the last four years. Extending this further takes money away from savers and the economy - but does not promote growth.’

It is not known how the Bank will apply this new policy. 

It could opt to commit to freeze interest rates unless unemployment falls below a certain level. Other options include tying the commitment to average wages or growth.  

The Bank is expected to slighty increase its GDP growth forecast and its say that inflation will be lower than previously anticipated. 

This follows a slew of data which indicates the economy is picking up speed, with manufacturers boasting a strong rebound in July - with the strongest growth since March 2011. 

Growth - as measured by GDP -  doubled to 0.6pc in the three months to the end of June, from the first quarter.

But the economy is still 3.3pc smaller than it was before the recession struck.  It is also lagging behind all the other members of the G7, except Italy.
