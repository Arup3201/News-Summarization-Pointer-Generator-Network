The daughter of Ground Force star Tommy Walsh had her throat slit during a brawl at an upmarket London nightclub, a court heard today.

Leanne Bloomfield, 28, used a shard of glass to slash Natalie Walsh, 22, upwards from her neck to her chin at Café De Paris near Leicester Square in central London, jurors heard.

Bloomfield allegedly pulled Miss Walsh's hair back before attacking her at the cabaret club, favoured by stars from Made In Chelsea and TOWIE, Southwark Crown Court heard.

She also kicked the 22-year-old, as she lay on the ground, and later texted a friend to say she'd had a 'massive punch up with some girl', adding: 'ha ha, b****, she got me good in the nose through', jurors were told.

Bloomfield allegedly went on to say: 'Me and my sister did a number on her, she was in a heap. They didn't catch me, ha ha.'

But she was caught because her Santander bank card had fallen into Ms Walsh's bag after their belongings spilled onto the floor during the row, the jury heard.

Ms Walsh also suffered a 'nasty cut' to her thumb, and needed an operation for a severed tendon, as well as treatment for the cut to her throat.

Bloomfield appeared in court wearing a white blouse and black, high-waisted, pencil skirt today.

Describing the incident, prosecutor Simon Ward said: 'Ms Walsh walked towards the dance floor and got into an altercation with the defendant.

'What she remembers is being grabbed by the hair by a girl with long brown hair. Her hair was pulled upwards stretching her neck.

The alleged brawl happened at London's Café de Paris, a nightclub and cabaret favoured by celebrities

'She tried to fight her assailant off and tried to elbow her away. All the while this was going on, she got the feeling someone else was attacking her from behind.

'She was cut with a piece of glass from the neck to the chin in an upward movement.'

He went on: 'She found herself on the floor.  Her bag had opened and all of her stuff was strewn all over the floor.'

Bloomfield was arrested on 4 February, the day after the incident, at her home in Colchester, Essex, when she is said to have told police: 'Yeah, I was there, I had a fight, she punched me.  It's not serious is it, she's OK?'

 'She was cut with a piece of glass from the neck to the chin in an upward movement.'

  - Simon Ward, prosecutor

 

The text messages were discovered after officers analysed her mobile phone, the court heard.

'What she seems to be doing is boasting about what happened,' Mr Ward added.

Bloomfield attended the nightclub, where a birthday party for a Big Brother star was being held, with a group including her sister, Vicky, and friend, Katie Cooper.

Both Bloomfield and Cooper are seen to kick Miss Walsh on CCTV footage, the court heard, but Bloomfield has been the only person to face court action as a result of the alleged attack.

Miss Walsh, 22, who is 6ft tall, said she couldn't move her thumb at all after the attack because the tendon had been severed.

The court heard how she had been out for dinner and drinks at the Beach Blanket Babylon restaurant in Shoreditch, east London, before heading to the club with two friends.

She drank three Jack Daniels and Diet Cokes while she was at the venue, but was not out of control and 'could handle it', jurors were told.

Miss Walsh, who said she was wearing waist-length hair extensions that night, said she could not remember actually being glassed because the 'episode was so sketchy'.

The celebrity builder, who became famous in the BBC's gardening show 
Ground Force with Charlie Dimmock, attended Southwark Crown Court today 
to hear the case against his daughter's alleged attacker

She said: 'I remember someone being behind me I was trying to get off, I felt someone on my right shoulder, then I just tried to get them off me, I tried to push them away.

'That's all I really remember. I remember my hair being pulled up by the root [and] I was on my knees at the end of it. It was just so quick.'

She said she had done nothing intentionally to provoke her attacker and denied pushing her in the face.

'I might have thrown a punch but I didn't push her in the face,' she said.  'What can you do when someone is attacking you but defend yourself?'

Miss Walsh's father, celebrity builder Tommy Walsh, who became a household name appearing with Charlie Dimmock in BBC gardening programme Ground Force, joined other relatives to watch the trial from the public gallery.

He has also featured in television shows including Tommy's DIY Survival, Our House and Celebrity Fit Club.

Bloomfield, of Highwoods, Colchester, Essex, denies a single count of wounding with intent.

The trial, which is expected to last up to three days, continues.
