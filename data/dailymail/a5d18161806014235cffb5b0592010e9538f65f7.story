Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross have apologised publicly for the 'Sachsgate' affair only to cause more controversy by cracking jokes about the Jimmy Savile paedophile scandal.

The pair have been reunited on television for the first time since their 2008 prank on BBC Radio 2, as the comedian appeared on Ross's ITV1 chat show set for broadcast tomorrow night.

But unable to avoid controversy for long, Brand said his friend 'didn't give a monkey's' about the furore caused after they made a series of offensive hoax phone calls to Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs.

Reunited: Russell Brand appears on Jonathan Ross' show, where they both apologise about 'Sachsgate' - the first time they have appeared together since it happened

Speaking about the Scotland Yard inquiry into sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile and others, the Hollywood star, 37, added: 'Can we just talk a while about how 
everyone from the 70s was a nonce? What's f****** going on? I was sat 
there watching telly and everyone's a nonce.'

Footage from Wednesday's recording, set for broadcast at 9.45pm tomorrow, showed the chat show host squirming in his seat, with his head in his hands, while his controversial guest spoke.

'Not everyone. Sir David Attenborough is a guest and in the f****** building. Revise your opinion,' Ross responded, adding: 'You left the country and left me to deal with it (Sachgate). We're going to get in trouble again. I don't earn as much as I used to thanks to you, you f*****.'

Back to joking: The pair discussed how the scandal had brought them closer as friends as a result - the only good to come out of it

The pair caused a national scandal in 2008 when they left smutty messages on veteran actor Andrews Sachs's answerphone during a pre-recorded Radio 2 show. 

Jonathan Ross said that Brand had sex with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie.

It led to the departure of the Radio 2 station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout.

Speaking during his chat show Ross said: 'Let's deal with this, because we're both keen to put this behind us. People, I think are perhaps curious as to how we felt about it afterwards.

'We did both regret the furore that we caused, and also the hurt it may have caused Mr Sachs and his family.'

As they were: The pair were colleagues broadcasting on BBC Radio 2 before they caused the uproar

Brand added: 'Obviously we regretted it because it became difficult to distinguish the media phenomena from the obvious impolite act.

'I consider myself quite a polite person right, but sometimes you get excited when you're doing a joke.

'I'm doing the joke, and I think 'this is brilliant, this is brilliant' and then you sort of realise, 'oh that's reality with real consequences.' I went 'oh it's only a joke' - I didn't realise that we were part of the frequency of reality.'

granddaughter

Making his entrance: Russell and Jonathan both left the BBC following the scandal and have now admitted they had lost sight of 'reality'

Ross told how the incident had been a bonding experience for the two of them - and had been a 'genuinely nice thing' which had resulted from the controversy.

'Russell and I went through an unusual experience together and even though we're both embarrassed by what we did, that's fair enough - but at the same time, the only genuinely nice thing that came out of it for me was the fact that we became very close,' he said.

But Brand then ribbed him: 'You said you'd do it again, let's call 
up other treasures of British comedy. Let's find the surviving Pythons 
and bang on their doors and go, "Oh, I touched your daughter's leg"'.

Brand went on to boast about his wild 
sex antics, drug-taking past and 'impressive criminal record', before 
going on to attempt to kiss Sir David later in the show, who promptly 
reeled away in horror.

He is launching a Comic Relief concert to be staged at Wembley Arena on March 6, featuring a line-up of friends which he has helped to assemble such as Noel Gallagher, Kasabian and Eddie Izzard.

Brand will host the show, called Give It Up For Comic Relief, to raise money and awareness for people with drug and alcohol problems.

Former heroin addict Brand told Ross that the death of his friend Amy Winehouse had made him realise he needed to help people.

'I'd occasionally chat to her a little bit but you know what it's like if you know someone that's got a drug and alcohol problem, it's really hard if they're not ready to help them along.

'When she died it made me feel like you've got to do something, it's so unnecessary,' he said.

But he joked to Ross: 'You're not invited, you can't be trusted.'

Other acts on the bill for the concert - to be screened by BBC3 - include Jimmy Carr, Noel Fielding, Frankie Boyle, Emeli Sande and Jessie J.

It's not yet known which parts of the pre-record will be included in the final edit of the show.

The Jonathan Ross Show is screened on ITV1 on Saturday at 9.45pm.
