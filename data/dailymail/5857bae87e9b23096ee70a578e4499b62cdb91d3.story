High Desert bunker killer: Collin Lee McGlaughlin, 24, will spend the rest of his life in jail over the 2008 murder of high school sweethearts in an abandoned Army dugout

A 24-year-old man obsessed with 'killing people at random' will spend the rest of his life in jail over the abduction and execution-style murder of a teenage couple in an abandoned Army bunker six years ago.

Collin Lee McGlaughlin was yesterday handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole after making a plea deal in December to avoid execution.

In a case which horrified Californians, McGlaughlin pleaded
 guilty to forcing high school sweethearts Christopher Cody Thomson, 18, and Bodhisattva 'Bodhi' Sherzer-Potter, 16, into a desert bunker near Barstow before shooting them dead on January 5, 2008.

The victims' families welcomed the sentence in court yesterday, which was handed down after they had delivered emotionally-charged impact statements.

'Collin McGlaughlin...you took my 
son, but let me tell you what you did not take: You did not take my 
memories, you did not take the things that made him what he was,' Pamela Thompson, Christopher's mother, said.

'He had everything you never had. And he was 
everything you’ll never be, He’ll always be a better man than you, even 
dead.'

Bodhi's mother, Lorraine
 Sherzer, said her daughter would have likely graduated from film school if she was still alive and would now be making movies, The Sun reported.

'There is no more laughter down the hall
 or constant phone calls or text messages, no more arguments of ‘Are you
 serious, Bodhi? Are you really going to wear that?' she said.

'There will be 
no high school or college graduations, no wedding dress, flowers or what
 colors to choose. I will never see her children or hold my 
granddaughter. The day she died the world went gray.'

McGlaughlin, however, did not act alone: two other men, 25-year-old David Brian Smith, and 22-year-old Cameron Thomson, were also allegedly involved.

The devastating crime unfolded in the early hours of January 5, 2008, as Christopher and Bodhi, standout students at the Academy for Academic Excellence, slept in their Jeep.

They spent the night in their car after attending a party in the bunker in the High Desert.

The were parked near the bunker, an abandoned military installation covered in graffiti which was a popular teen hangout.

The victims' friends later told investigators that McGlaughlin, then 18, Smith, 19, and Thomson, 16, rocked up to the party in a Honda Odyssey van and asked if they could join. They brought a bottle of raspberry-flavored Bacardi which they handed around.

It was when the party dispersed that McGlaughlin, the son of a retired Los Angeles Unified School District police officer, announced the plan to his two young friends.

According to testimony, McGlaughlin ordered that Thomson stay in the van and act as a lookout.

McGlaughlin and Smith, who was allegedly holding a gun, banged on the windows of the Jeep - the last car at the party - and forced the sleeping couple out of the vehicle at gunpoint about 4am

They marched the young lovers, half-dressed and barefoot, into the bunker, ordering them to drop to their knees, The Press-Enterprise reported.

McGlaughlin killed the pair in an execution-style shooting, however prosecutors believe the autopsy report suggests Smith may have fired at least one of the 
shots, Daily Press reports.

McGlaughlin later bragged in jail that he had killed a pair of high school sweethearts and said shooting someone was 'a hell of an adrenaline rush'.

McGlaughlin and Smith were charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder, 
kidnapping and robbery.

Smith pleaded not guilty to the charges and still awaits trial.

Thomson pleaded guilty in March 2011 to two counts of voluntary manslaughter.

The bunker - the ruins of a World War II airfield and subsequent radio relay station for the military - has since been demolished.

Court transcripts reveal Collin McGlaughlin (pictured) was feared in the years, and especially days, leading up to the January 5, 2008, murders, with his father reportedly locking up his own guns to keep his son from getting to them

In 2009, McGlaughlin pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. But two years later, a jury found the 
dramatically slimmed-down man mentally competent to stand trial despite 
claims by the defense that he was schizophrenic.

His mother, Lynda McGlaughlin, yesterday said she was sorry the victims' families felt the way they did toward her son and her family.

'There
 weren’t any winners,' she said. 'They portrayed Collin as a 
monster. Others know differently. And I’m hoping we could move on.'

While McGlaughlin said in a pre-sentencing hearing he was 'not proud' of his crimes, it was reported at the time of the incident that McGlaughlin was deeply troubled.

McGlaughlin was considered a 'ticking timebomb' who was 
feared - including by his own family - leading up to the attack.

His
 father allegedly locked up his guns in case his son tried to access 
them, while McGlaughlin's friends allegedly called him 'psychotic'.

Redlands Daily Facts has provided a chilling profile of McGlaughlin, who was raised in a highly dysfunctional household.

According to the publication, McGlaughlin had been prescribed myriad medications to stabilize his mood swings and diagnosed with multiple psychological disorders beginning at age five.

In his teens, he began sharing with friends his dark fantasies around mass murder and mayhem.

By the time of his arrest for the 'bunker killings', McGlaughlin had attended seven different schools, done stints in two boys homes and in juvenile hall and had been admitted to the hospital twice for psychiatric evaluation.

McGlaughlin kept a chilling MySpace.com blog with photos of himself brandishing a shotgun and pistol, Los Angeles Times reported.

He called himself an 'Equal Opertunity (sic) Merchant of Death' who listed 10 things he believed.

At the top, he wrote: 'I entered this world screaming and covered in someone else's blood and thats how I intend to leave it (sic)'.

He had also written on an internet blogging site about 'killing people at random', however police said he had no clear motive for the 2008 double homicide.
