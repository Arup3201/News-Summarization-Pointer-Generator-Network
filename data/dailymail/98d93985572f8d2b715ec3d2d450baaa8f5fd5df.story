Alex Salmond is being lined up for an explosive battle against Treasury chief Danny Alexander in next year's General Election.

Sources claim the outgoing SNP leader could launch an audacious bid to steal the LibDem minister's seat and claim a senior coalition 'scalp'.

The challenge would trigger a UK-wide media frenzy, force the LibDems to throw everything at the constituency and give Mr Salmond a chance to resurrect his political career after his defeat in the independence referendum.

Outgoing SNP leader Alex Salmond could launch an audacious bid to steal Lib Dem minister Danny Alexander's seat and claim a senior coalition 'scalp'

Mr Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is defending a large majority of 8,765 in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, but the LibDem vote is expected to collapse in May's contest.

Mr Salmond lives on the other side of the country in Strichen in Aberdeenshire, however he regularly holidays in a cottage near Inverness and plays golf at the world-renowned Castle Stuart course in the Highlands.

The outgoing First Minister – who will hand over to Nicola Sturgeon next week - is expected to announce that he will launch a dramatic bid to return to Westminster within days.

The Tories and LibDems have already placed their local parties in the Aberdeenshire seat of Gordon on a war-footing, as the Scottish Daily Mail exclusively revealed last month, with that seat still considered the most likely option by most observers. 

LibDem grandee Sir Malcolm Bruce is standing down and Gordon covers the Aberdeenshire East constituency represented by Mr Salmond at Holyrood.

However, the LibDem candidate is a former journalist, Christine Jardine, who has no public profile.

One senior Nationalist source said: 'Alex wants a scalp. He won't get that in Gordon and he has a pick of any seat.' 

Mr Salmond will officially hand over to Nicola Sturgeon next week, when she becomes SNP leader and First Minister

Ex-PM Gordon Brown would be drafted in for the general election if Jim Murphy becomes Scottish Labour leader

Gordon Brown is set to play a major campaigning role in next year's General Election if Jim Murphy wins the increasingly bitter Labour leadership battle.

Mr Murphy yesterday revealed he has spoken to the former Prime Minister as the contest to replace Johann Lamont intensified.

Today, his main rival Neil Findlay – a staunch left-winger – will launch his leadership bid with a thinly-veiled attack on career politicians. 

Many in the party wanted Gordon Brown to take control of Scottish Labour, but he declined to return to frontline politics.

However, Mr Murphy said: 'I envision Gordon Brown having a big part to play. I spoke to him at length and I would like Gordon to have a big part in our election campaign.

'He was so formidable during the referendum campaign and I want him to use his energy and passion again for Scottish Labour.

'It will be for geeing up the troops but also for convincing voters. Labour has got to come together as a team because teams win whereas divided groups lose.' 

Mr Alexander would be an easy target as Mr Salmond could blame him for the Tory-LibDem austerity programme. 

Latest polls suggest the LibDems could be wiped out in nearly all their seats north of the Border, except Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael's Orkney and Shetland stronghold.

However, a Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman said: 'If the man who installed the hated average speed cameras on the A9, abolished Northern Constabulary and stood by the routine arming of police wants to run for a seat nearly 100 miles from his home, we think he should bring it on. People in Inverness deserve better than being someone's second best.'

Mr Salmond is known to be fond of working in Westminster, and was an MP for Banff and Buchan for 23 years until 2010. He could return as the party's Westminster leader, replacing Angus Robertson who observers believe has already been sidelined.

The SNP has not yet chosen its candidates for May's General Election. Mr Salmond will almost certainly not contest his old Banff and Buchan seat as it already represented by the party's Eilidh Whiteford.

In Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, Mr Alexander's main challenge came from Labour in the 2010 General Election. But the Holyrood seat of Inverness and Nairn is represented by the SNP's Fergus Ewing, who won in 2011 with a massive majority of nearly 10,000, and Nationalist strategists believe they can therefore challenge Mr Alexander next May.

The easier option for Mr Salmond would be Gordon, where the LibDems currently have a majority of 6,748 on a 36 per cent share of the vote. The SNP moved ahead of Labour and the Tories into second place in 2010, and in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Mr Salmond was returned in Aberdeenshire East with a massive majority of 15,295.

One LibDem source in the area said: 'We haven't heard anything officially, but we're expecting Salmond to make an announcement any day.

'But we're confident we can beat him – he's not as popular as he was in 2011 and the referendum saw a 60 per cent No vote in this area. People used to see him as invincible, but that's not the case now.

'He's something of a spent force.'

During an episode of the BBC show Question Time last month, filmed in Liverpool, Mr Salmond was asked by presenter David Dimbleby whether he would consider a return to Westminster.

The First Minister replied: 'The answer to your question David, absolutely decisively I can tell you I haven't made up my mind. So you'll have to wait and see.

'But I tell you what, when I do make up my mind, invite me back on to Question Time and I'll tell you why I did it.'

Mr Dimbleby asked Mr Salmond: 'So it is not a closed door?'

Mr Salmond replied: 'You can take that from what I have just told you David, that's right'.
