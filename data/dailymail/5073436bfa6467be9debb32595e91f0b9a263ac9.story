Sportsmail’s Mike Dickson speaks to British Australian Open quarter-finalist Dom Inglot ahead of Andy Murray's last eight clash with Nick Kyrgios at the Rod Laver Arena. 

Inglot feels Murray has the quality to overcome Kyrgios despite the rapturous home support that will be cheering on the Australian at the Melbourne showpiece. 

Inglot and his team-mate Florin Mergea caused a major upset in the Australian Open doubles after they defeated brothers Bob and Mike Bryan to reach the knockout stages. 

Andy Murray is ready to deal with a vocal home crowd when he faces Nick Kyrgios in Melbourne
