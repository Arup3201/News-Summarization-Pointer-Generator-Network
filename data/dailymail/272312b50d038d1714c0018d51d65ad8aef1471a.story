A Wall Street do-gooder whose weapon of choice is the short sell has waged war on companies engaged in fraud as the 'Batman' of the financial markets.

Styling himself after the Dark Knight, Daniel Yu, a 32-year-old investor linked to the firm Gotham City Research, has gone up against several corporations and won.

Gotham City Research's strategy is to perform 'due diligence-based, special situation investing,' which in practice means short selling targeted companies then publicizing the fraud.

In April, Gotham went after Quindell, a British firm, alleging that '42%-80% of Quindell's profits are suspect' in a report unceremoniously tweeted one morning.

'Quindell was little more than a country club until 2008/2009,' the report continues, but began reporting 'Google-esque' profit margins two years later.

After the report was published, the outsourcing and consulting corporation's stock price tumbled 39 percent in a single day according to Bloomberg.

Quindell's chief exec later resigned, along with the company's finance director and a third employee, after several other missteps. 

Yu has been hesitant to reveal too much of his identity, not wanting to open himself up to the animosity that short selling can attract.

Instead of Wayne Manor, Yu hides out in his home on Staten Island, the New York Post reports. Apart from his MIT education and work as a hedge-fund analyst, little is known about his life.  

Crusader: Yu's stance is that authorities and regulators often lack the resources to go after bad actors, leaving the work up to activist investors like Gotham City Research

On July 1, Gotham struck again, alleging that Spanish telecom Gowex could legitimately claim only around 10 percent of the sales they reported on the books.

Stock fell 46 percent and a week later, the firm was filing for insolvency, its chief executive officer resigning and admitting the last four years of financial results were fraudulent. 

'If you pay close attention to Batman, he always worked within the spirit and the letter of the law,' Yu told Bloomberg by phone (the media shy investor denied the Post an interview).

'He’s not a vigilante. He realizes that the authorities have scarce resources and limited personnel. We are driven by the desire to show people that the world doesn’t belong to seemingly untouchable wrong-doers.'

Yu reportedly soured on the financial markets after a big bet in  Freddie Mac went bust along with the mortgage lender in 2008.

Gotham, which has also gone after tech stocks Ebix and Blucora, as well as Tile Shop Holdings, has not disclosed how much it has made off its pursuit of deceitful corporations.

The practice is similar to other small short sellers, such as Carson Block's Muddy Waters, which targets 'inflated' Chinese corporations.

Block reportedly visited one targeted company, Olam, back in 2012, disguised in street clothes and a baseball cap and claiming to be a hedge fund investor, the Financial Times reports.

Block's publicised pursuit of the commodities and supply chain service helped knock 21 percent off the share price. 

Online, Yu alternates between discussing weaknesses in the financial markets and tweeting Martin Luther King, Jr, and Bible quotes.

'It seems that if one truly cares about justice, one must be equally concerned about plight of poor, oppressed, etc., as the falsely accused,' he recently opined from behind the veil of his Twitter.

 

An earlier version of this article stated that Gotham had ‘brought down’ outsourcing company Quindell. We are happy to clarify that while Gotham City research investigated its practices, Quindell continues to operate. We apologise for any contrary suggestion.
