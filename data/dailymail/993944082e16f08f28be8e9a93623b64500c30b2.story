You will never want to take the stairs or lift again after taking a whirl on this slide that will make you feel like a kid again.

With an eye toward catering to customers’ every need, a luxury bunkhouse in South Wales has installed an indoor slide as an alternative to the stairs.

Guests can make a speedy exit from the huge sofas on the top level down to the ground level, adding a playful twist to the average group holiday. 

 Indoor playground: Wye Valley Canoe Centre has installed a slide between the two levels of its bunkhouse

The floor-to-floor tubular slide has been a hit with guests since it was added to the contemporary bunkhouse at the Wye Valley Canoe Centre at Glasbury.

Owner Jane Hughes said: ‘A customer asked me if I was going to have a slide in it and, well, that was it. An imaginative local playground designer contacted a German company who made it for us. 

‘It is primarily a space for adults to chill, to lounge on enormous sofas or flop into bean bags and whoosh down the slide. I love it and I think everyone else does too.’

Located on the River Wye in the Brecon Beacons mountain range, the bunkhouse is a converted chapel located next to the Wye Valley Canoe Centre’s River Café, where visitors can hire canoes, kayaks, mountain bikes, tandems and Vespas.
