There is a stage in the career of every top player when it feels as though they have come of age. That time appears to have arrived for Daniel Sturridge.

With England’s opening game of the World Cup against Italy on the horizon, the Liverpool striker has become the team’s talisman.

Class act: Daniel Sturridge curls home the opener after 32 minutes to put England on the road to victory

The eyes have: Sturridge hit his fourth international goal ahead of England's flight to Miami

His goal against Peru on Friday at 
Wembley — his fourth in England colours — added to his growing 
reputation within the game. Sturridge is handling it all brilliantly, 
refusing to take anything for granted.

‘There
 are obviously certain players who have their spots nailed down, but in 
my mind I haven’t and I am working hard every day to show what I can 
do,’ Sturridge admitted.

‘For
 me there are no guarantees in football and I will just work hard and 
not worry about what team the manager will pick. I will focus on what I 
can do for the team and leave the decisions to the boss because that is 
what he does.’

Fitness permitting, the 24-year-old, who has won 11 caps, starts against Italy in Manaus. He simply has to.

Sturridge
 scored 21 times in the Barclays Premier League for Liverpool and his 
run of good form has continued for the national team. Leaving him out 
for tactical reasons is inconceivable.

‘I haven’t thought about my goal against Peru — it’s gone now,’ he added.

‘I’m not revelling in it, I’m not worrying about it. It’s about the team, it’s not just about myself.’

Every
 England team needs someone they can rely on to score goals at vital 
times and Sturridge is in line to follow some of the greats.

He
 has already spoken about Gary Lineker’s record as England’s 
second-highest top scorer with 48 goals in 80 matches. Sturridge was 
surprised to learn that Lineker won the Golden Boot with six goals at 
the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and added four more at Italia 90. That is 
genuine class.

Then there is Michael Owen and his impact at France 98, or Wayne Rooney’s four goals at Euro 2004.

‘Everyone
 is desperate to show what they can do and desperate to bring some 
success,’ said Sturridge. ‘I am thankful to the fans for being behind 
us. We understand the magnitude of the task. It’s a big task to go to a 
World Cup and have success.

‘We
 have a great squad and whatever happens out there in Brazil we just 
want to put in the performances that we can be proud of.’

At
 Wembley on Friday, Sturridge’s left-footed effort beyond Peru keeper 
Raul Fernandez was the highlight of a functional, disciplined 3-0 win.

He
 has taken the heat off Rooney at a time when the country is beginning 
to wonder whether they really will see the best of the Manchester United
 forward at a World Cup.

‘I try not to think about the pressure, it’s about the team, not just myself and Wayne Rooney.’

It was a neat answer, but Sturridge’s importance to this team is increasing with every international.

He
 will be rested on Wednesday in Miami’s Sun Life  Stadium as Hodgson 
turns to the shadow squad for the warm-up clash with Ecuador.

It
 is here in Florida, with the humidity recorded at 73 per cent yesterday
 afternoon, where Hodgson hopes to be able to simulate the conditions he
 will find against Italy in Manaus.

‘It’s the next phase and it’s going to be a lot more difficult in terms of the conditions,’ he added.

‘It’s great preparation and we know it will be even warmer when we get to Brazil.

‘It’s good to have two games in Miami to prepare well and train hard. We never make excuses about the conditions.

‘We have to adapt our style to the conditions. You can’t always play the way you want to play when it’s warmer.

‘It’s not about worrying about the heat, the rain or the snow, you just adapt and look to play football regardless.’

It
 will be a different test for England here and Hodgson is expected to 
revert to a full-strength team against  Honduras on Saturday.

When he names it, Sturridge will be among the starters.
