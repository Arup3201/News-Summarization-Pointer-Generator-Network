Real Madrid ensured Gareth Bale wouldn’t be able to do a Yaya Toure by succeeding where Manchester City failed in getting their star man a birthday cake.

The 25-year-old Welshman posed with a picture of the cake bites in the Real Madrid dressing room, looking in a positive mood ahead of his second season at the Bernabeu.

City midfielder Toure, on the other hand, was the centre of a controversy before the World Cup when the he and his agent came out with a series of unusual complaints surrounding his birthday.

They claimed City had not congratulated Toure for reaching his 31st birthday.

'No. money is not important,' his agent Dimitry Seluk said in May.

'If City don’t respect him, then easy - Yaya will leave. No problem.

'He [Toure] got a cake, but when it was Roberto Carlos’s birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti.

'I don’t expect City to present Yaya with a Bugatti, we only asked that they shook his hand and said, "We congratulate you". It is the minimum they must do when it is his birthday and the squad is all together.

Behind the scenes: Agent Seluk claimed Toure was unhappy at Man City and was '50-50' to leave

'Of course, Yaya is upset about this. It is his birthday and nobody said anything or shook his hand, so he does not feel comfortable.'

Many thought Bale, who received the 
cake from his team-mates, would struggle at the Bernabeu 
under the pressure of a world-record transfer fee of £86million.

Instead, he scored 22 goals in his 44 appearances, an impressive record for a first year abroad.

Bale also shares his birthday with former Spurs team-mates Andros Townsend and Mousa Dembele, and the former tweeted a reply to his club's well wishes by joking: 'What no cake? Haha.'
