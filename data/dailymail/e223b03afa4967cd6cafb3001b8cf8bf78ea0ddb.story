Nasa’s latest solar observatory has captured footage of the sun belching out a stream of charged particles at 1.5 million miles per hour.

The curtain of radiation, which erupted on May 9, was the first coronal mass ejection (CME) observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or Iris.

The footage reveals the CME in ‘extraordinary detail’ showing a field of view about five Earths wide and seven-and-a-half Earths tall.

CMEs are a mass of charged particles and magnetic field energy that bursts from the sun like a volcanic eruption.

Material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach 
Earth, but in this case, the coronal mass ejection didn't affect our planet.

Coronal mass ejections interact with Earth’s magnetic field to generate auroras and magnetic storms.

The CME's magnetic fields peel back 
the outermost layers of Earth's fields changing their very shape, 
distortions which can can degrade communication signals and cause 
unexpected surges in power grids.

They
 also can cause aurora. Storms are rare during solar minimum, but as the
 sun nears solar maximum, large storms occur several times per year.

Because the observatory has to position itself a day in advance, it was a stroke of luck that the eruption happened just as the probe was pointing the right way.

‘We focus in on active regions to try to see a flare or a CME,’ said Bart De Pontieu, the Iris science lead at Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory in California.

‘And then we wait and hope that we'll catch something. This is the first clear CME for Iris so the team is very excited.’

During a CME, changes in the sun’s magnetic fields cause a large section of the surface of the sun to expand rapidly, ejecting billions of tonnes of particles out into space.

Iris must commit to pointing at certain areas of the sun at least a day in advance, so catching a CME in the act involves some educated guesses and a little bit of luck. Pictured is the solar flare captured by Iris (right) and the same flare later seen by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (left)

Material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach Earth, peeling back the outermost layers of the planet’s magnetic field.

CME’s can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected surges in power grids. However, this CME is not thought to have made a significant impact on Earth.

CME’s often accompany a solar flare – a solar eruption that pushes out waves of light all across the spectrum.

Iris can observe both types of eruption. It was launched in June 2013 to study what's known as the interface region, which is a layer between the sun's surface the corona that has long baffled scientists.

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.

Astronauts
are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this
manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure 
during space walks.

The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.

Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.

A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.

Geomagnetic
storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater 
dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric 
currents.

By capturing light emitted by atoms of 
different temperatures, Iris can looks at different heights above the 
sun's surface to analyse this obscure layer. 

The line moving across the middle of the movie is the entrance slit for Iris’ spectrograph, an instrument that can split light into its many wavelengths – a technique that ultimately allows scientists to measure temperature, velocity and density of the solar material behind the slit.

While the strength of this CME is yet to be revealed, it follows on the heels of the most powerful type of solar flare that’s ever been recorded by the space agency.

The huge event on the sun occurred on 29 March 2014, but Nasa has only now analysed the data from their fleet of observatories.

This fleet consisted of four telescopes in space and one observatory on Earth.

The flare observed was an X-class flare, the biggest and highest-energy solar flares that have ever been observed.

This close-up of the sunspot underneath the March 29, 2014, flare shows incredible detail. The image was captured by the G-band camera at Sacramento Peak in New Mexico. This instrument can focus on only a small area at once, but provide very high resolution

This combined image shows the X-class flare as seen through the eyes of different observatories. The SDO is on the left, which helps show the position of the flare on the sun. The darker orange square is Iris data. The red rectangular inset is from Sacramento Peak. The violet spots show the flare's footpoints from RHESSI

In particular it was an X1 flare, which is the lowest intensity within the X category but significantly more powerful than the majority of flares.

Coordinated observations like this are crucial to understanding such eruptions on the sun and their effects on space weather near Earth.

Such research can help scientists better understand what catalyst sets off these large explosions on the sun.

Perhaps they may even some day be able to predict their onset and forewarn of the radio blackouts solar flares can cause near Earth - blackouts that can interfere with airplane, ship and military communications.
