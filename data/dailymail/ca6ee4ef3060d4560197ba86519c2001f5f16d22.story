Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal has instructed the club to make midfield and defence their priority in their recruitment drive.

While soundings have been made for Arjen Robben and Edinson Cavani, Van Gaal hopes Luke Shaw's transfer can be wrapped up with the finer details of the £27million fee to be finalised.

However, scouts have also been busy compiling reports on members of his Holland squad for scrutiny by the club's hierarchy ahead of possible bids.

Dutch legion: Louis van Gaal is eyeing Holland defender Daryl Janmaat (left) at Manchester United

Potential: Bruno Martins Indi has been watched by United but Stefan de Vrij (right) is going to join Lazio

Options open: Roma's Kevin Strootman remains a firm favourite within Old Trafford this summer

Feyenoord centre-back Bruno Martins Indi is one while his teammate Daryl Janmaat, the right-back, has also been watched.

Their club mate and fellow defender Stefan de Vrij has been linked with United but he is likely to sign for Lazio over the coming days.

A deal for Roma's Kevin Strootman remains on the cards once he proves he is recuperating well from his knee ligament injury.

David Moyes had a deal agreed in principle for Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos and that should still go through.

Wolfsburg, meanwhile, have agreed a deal with Eintracht Frankfurt for right-back Sebastian Jung who has been attracting interest from Arsenal and United.

Leicester City are showing interest in Dutch goalscoring sensation Lars Veldwijk.

The 6ft 5ins striker plays for Excelsior in Holland's second division but has grabbed the attention of scouts by scoring 30 goals in 38 games this season.

The 22-year-old was close to joining Roda in January but ultimately Excelsior rejected the bids.Leicester are keen to bring in a target man after having a bid rejected for Brighton's Leonardo Ulloa, however, they will face competition for Veldwijk from Midlands neighbours Nottingham Forest.

Incoming manager Stuart Pearce has been spotted at recent Excelsior games and he is looking to recruit a striker for the new season.

Standard Liege striker Michy Batshuayi is unlikely to sign for Swansea despite an apparent £7 million deal being agreed between the clubs. The Belgium U21 international is highly regarded and is hoping bigger clubs firm up their interest.

Everton and Arsenal both remain keen but have been pursuing other strikers of late. The 20-year-old has scored 19 goals this season.

Swansea have an interest in in Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski with Michel Vorm expected to join Liverpool, as reported in Sportsmail, while Swansea are also keen on Stephen Kingsley and Will Vaulks from Scottish side Falkirk.

Liverpool's Luis Alberto is wanted on loan by Malaga. The 21-year-old was a £7million signing from Sevilla last summer but has barely figured for Liverpool during their charge towards Premier League runners up. Alberto is attracting interest from a lot of Spanish sides after impressing during his loan with Barcelona B in 2012-13.

Liverpool are looking to strengthen their squad ahead of next season's Champions League campaign and are considering other wide players which will push Alberto further down the pecking order.

Zoltan Gera is weighing up a return to his native Hungary with Ferencvaros. The 35-year-old was one of several players to be released by West Bromwich Albion last week and he has held talks about a possible return to the club where he made 115 appearances between 2000 and 2004.

The free agent is also exploring possible options to remain in England.

On the way out? Newcastle could sell Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa this summer and want Romanian Stefan Radu

Too much? The Magpies are keen on Stoke's Ryan Shawcross but have yet to lodge a bid

Newcastle United have expressed an interest in Romania defender Stefan Radu. The Lazio centre-back has been linked with Tottenham and Manchester United but the main interest has been from Fiorentina who are keen on him and Thomas Vermaelen of Arsenal.

Lazio are ready to sell Radu, 27, because his contract runs out in 2016 and he has not shown a willingness to re-negotiate. They do not want to risk him running down his deal so will sell for £8 million.

Newcastle are looking to improve their centre-back options with Stephen Taylor and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa possibly being sold later in the window. They are keen on Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross but have yet to bid.

..........................................................................

AC Milan have rekindled interest in Newcastle full-back Davide Santon while Monaco remain keen on Mathieu Debuchy.

Sunderland will hold a budget meeting this week as they look to undertake a summer overhaul similar to the scale undertaken by Paolo di Canio. The scenario is one Gus Poyet wanted to avoid but with so many players keen to leave and some surplus to requirements big changes are inevitable.

Jack Colback is talking to clubs such as West Ham and Swansea while Craig Gardner has joined West Bromwich Albion. Olympiakos are keen on striker Ignacio Scocco.
