Mark Hughes has warned Premier League defenders that Peter Crouch is just as dangerous in the air as Harry Kane following the Stoke striker's late equaliser against Newcastle.

Crouch's leveller at St James' Park was his 44th headed goal in the Barclays Premier League.

The 34-year-old, who has previously played in the top-flight for the likes of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Tottenham, is just two behind Alan Shearer's Premier League headed goals record.

Tottenham striker Kane made the headlines over the weekend by firing an impressive double, which included a superb header, against north London rivals Arsenal but Hughes believes Crouch is just as talented in the air.

Hughes said: 'I think somebody mentioned over the weekend that Harry Kane is the only player who scores that type of goal.

'But that's an oversight on Peter Crouch who's been doing that for years. It's a great ball from Geoff Cameron and a fantastic header.

'Peter has been unlucky in the last few weeks because he hasn't started games, but he's very much valued by myself and the club.'

Crouch is expected to break Shearer's record as the 6ft 7ins forward has recently extended his stay at the Britannia Stadium by signing a new two-year deal.
