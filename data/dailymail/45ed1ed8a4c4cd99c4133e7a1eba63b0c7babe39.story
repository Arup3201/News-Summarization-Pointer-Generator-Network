A dedicated artist set herself the task of painting a mini masterpiece every day for a year and enjoyed the challenge so much that almost two years later she continues to paint on a daily basis. 

Since January 1 2013, Lorraine Loots has created a new piece of tiny artwork every day.

Lorraine, who lives in Cape Town, South Africa, spends between three and six hours each day creating her small, intricate paintings of everything from stunning scenery to celebrities to animals and everything in between.

'The best part of my day has to be when I get to sit down and paint,' she explained.

Initially the task, which she called 365 Postcards For Ants Project, was to last just a year, but Lorraine enjoyed it so much that she has kept it up and even plans to paint on her wedding day later this year.

'Initially I thought of the project as a massive challenge like a marathon I would be relieved to survive,' she said. 'It became this meditative time - a quiet and almost sacred part of each day.'

Since she started, the project has also taken on a life of its own thanks to social media.

Lorraine has attracted tens-of-thousands of fans on Instagram and uses it both as a means to sell her work for £50 a painting and also to take requests from fans who suggest things that they would like to see her paint

Lorraine has attracted tens-of-thousands of fans on Instagram and use it both as a means to sell her work and also to take requests from fans who suggest things that they would like to see her paint.

'People started booking sentimental dates making suggestions for the painting to be done on that day,' she explains on her website. 'Every day, I posted the completed picture online, and unsold pieces could be reserved by commenting on the picture.' 

In January, all 365 pieces completed in 2013 were exhibited in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

With her hometown named the 2014 World Design Capital, Lorraine decided to give herself the challenge of making every painting  Cape Town themed. She is selling the 12.5 x 12.5 cm paintings for R900 each (£50), while 10 x 10 cm postcards cost R400 (£23).

'The response has been immensely positive and almost overwhelming,' she said.
