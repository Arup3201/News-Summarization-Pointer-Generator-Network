A woman accused of having sex with skeletons after police discovered pictures of her kissing human skulls has been convicted of disturbing the peace of the dead and ordered to undergo treatment for psychiatric problems.

The 37-year-old Swedish woman has not been named, but pictures of her collection of human bones, including ones of her snuggling up to bed with a skull, were released last month.

Prosecutors in the city of Gothenburg had alleged she used the bones for sexual gratification but she avoided charges of necrophilia and she was instead charged with 'disturbing the peace of the dead'.

Guilty: These police pictures are taken from the investigation into a Swedish woman charged with possession of human skulls and bones, which the prosecution claimed she used for sexual purposes

Close relationship: Police found astonishing photos in which a woman is seen kissing and hugging the skulls

Skull: The prosecution claimed the woman had handled the bones in a 'shameful' and 'unethical' manner

She reportedly told a local newspaper in Gothenburg that she was an 'odd bird' but 'not sexually 
interested in necrophilia'. She was also convicted of weapons crimes and sentenced to probation.

A court statement reads: 'Criminal 
protection starts when a person dies, and the protection remains as long
 as there are remains of the deceased.

'The fact that the woman had moved 
bones constitutes a crime because she was unauthorised to do so, just as
 it's a crime to put together a skeleton and have it lying on the floor,
 to have bones in plastic bags, and to sell them.'

The woman, had denied the allegations - claiming she collected the bones out of
 historical interest.

Her grisly hoard was discovered in September when police were called to the woman's flat following reports of gunfire.

Photos 
from a morgue were reportedly found hidden in the woman's home as well as a drill,  body bags and an 
access code to a morgue. However police found no
 proof that she was a grave-digger.

On the floor: The Swedish woman was charged with possession of human skulls and bones, which the prosecution claimed she used for sexual purposes

In her flat: Police also allegedly found CDs titled 'My Necrophilia' and 'My first experience' as well as photos in which a woman is seen kissing and hugging the skulls

Extraordinary: The 37 year-old woman kept at least six skulls, one spine and 'a large number of other bones' in her Gothenburg apartment, according to the prosecution's charge sheet

In storage: The Swedish news agency TT cited a prosecutor as saying that the 37-year-old woman is suspected of using the remains, which included six skulls and one backbone, in 'sexual situations'

Collection: The woman, from south-western Sweden, was charged at Gothenburg District Court yesterday

'Previous comments': The woman allegedly wrote on an internet forum a few years ago: 'My morals set my limits and I'm prepared to take the punishment if something should happen. It's worth it'

The Goeteborgsposten newspaper alleged that she wrote on an 
internet forum a few years ago: ‘My morals set my limits and I'm 
prepared to take the punishment if something should happen.

'It's worth 
it. I want my man like he 
is, whether he is dead or alive. He allows me to find sexual happiness 
on the side.’

'I want my man like he is, whether he is dead or alive. He allows me to find sexual happiness on the side'

What woman 'wrote on an internet forum'

Police also allegedly found CDs titled
 ‘My Necrophilia’ and ‘My first experience’ as well as the photos in 
which a woman is seen getting close to the skulls, reported Swedish news
 agency TT.

The woman, who has admitted that the 
items were kept in her apartment but denies doing anything wrong, was 
arrested in September and faces up to two years in jail if found guilty.

'Some of the photos show a woman 
licking a skull,' prosecutor Kristina Ehrenborg-Staffas told The Local newspaper in Sweden. 'We claim it’s her, but she claims it's someone else and she found the 
pictures on the internet.'

She sold three skulls and a spine to a 
person in Uppsala earlier this year, prosecutors said.
