Nine months after the shutdown gave government workers an unexpected 16 days off, birth rates in the Washington D.C. area have soared.

With parks closed and dismal October weather keeping many workers indoors, those affected by the shutdown were forced to seek simpler methods to keep themselves amused - the results of which are clearly now bearing fruit.

The shutdown itself - which lasted from October 1 to October 16 - took place after the Republican-dominated Congress failed to pass their Federal Budget for 2014 in protest at the U.S. President's radical 'Obamacare' overhaul of the healthcare system.

Nothing else to do: Nine months after the shutdown gave government workers an unexpected 16 days off and closed numerous attractions (pictued) birth rates in the Washington D.C. area have soared

With 850,000 employees affected, a total of 6.6million working days were lost as a result of last year's government shutdown - the longest in U.S. history.

The cost to the American economy is estimated to be £2.2billion.

But perhaps the most surprising impact of the 16 day break is a dramatic increase in the birth rate in the Washington D.C. area.

Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., has seen an additional 
three births per day in July, according to spokesman Gary Stephenson. 

'We’re at near-capacity right now,' Stephenson told ABC News, joking that some furloughed workers 'apparently found ways 
to amuse themselves.'

Meanwhile Virginia Hospital in nearby Arlington delivered almost 100 more babies in the April, May and June than they did in the same period last year, according to 
spokeswoman Maryanne Boster.

'How long until someone on television points out that during the shutdown the folks in Washington are apparently doing at home what Washington has been accused of doing to the American people?' anchor Brian Williams joked during NBC's Nightly News.

There is a great deal of debate over whether or not events like the shutdown do lead to a spike in births.

While some sceptics say pregnancies are so random that any given hospital can have a single birth one day and 20 the next, others are convinced there is a link.

Dr Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ senior medical contributor and a practicing obstetrician said: 'I can say that I've definitely seen spikes after things like hurricanes, blackouts and blizzards.'

'I’m not aware of any hard data on this,
 but anecdotally, many obstetricians will ask their patients about the 
events nine months prior, and many women will say 'Yes, we conceived 
during the blackout',' she added.

The link between births and major events is nothing new; nine months after Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. eastern seaboard, the birth rate in New Jersey was up 74 per cent on the previous year.

And an even clearer indicator came during 1989, when South Carolina was hit by Hurricane Hugo.

Nine months after the storm, the state saw the birth rate spike in each of the nine counties declared disaster areas, but in neighbouring counties that were unaffected, the birth rate was normal.
