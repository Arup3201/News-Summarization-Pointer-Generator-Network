Ashley James rose to fame on our screens through the TV show Made In Chelsea.

But the stunning model and TV presenter has an established career in fashion, even launching her own jewellery line called Whistle & Bango.

She's known for modelling for brands like House Of Peroni and STORY by Kranz & Ziegler, but her latest venture sees the gorgeous blonde, 26, showcasing her incredible figure posing in lingerie crafted for curvier women.

The slender star carries off the latest fashions just like any other catwalk model.

But she showcases her 30F assets for the first time in a fashion campaign for up and coming lingerie brand Tutti Rouge. 

The brand took inspiration from the film Interview With The Vampire for their AW14 Carpe Diem collection.

The fun-loving lingerie label have put a sassy twist on the tale of love and betrayal with the help of Ashley who plays a cheeky character frolicking in the depths of a decadent mansion.

The jewel tones of Tutti's AW14 collection compliment the dark and mysterious surroundings - definitely a treat. 

A new brand on the block, Tutti Rouge are competing with the likes of Freya and Panache in the big boobs market with sizes going from a 28-38 D-J - and everything in between.

They launched in 2012; 18 months on they're is stocked in more than 10 countries, and they've now bagged Ashley as their face and body for the next few seasons.

'We are delighted that Ashley James is the face of Tutti Rouge for AW14 and SS15,' says Jessica Prebble, creative director of Tutti Rouge.

With more than 18 years experience in the lingerie industry Jessica set out to develop a brand which ticks all the boxes - great design, great fit, great price and great fun. 

Ashley says: 'I love that Tutti offers cute and girly sets for girls with curves. It's cute, fun and flirty!'

Each season Tutti Rouge bring out a daytime, evening, mid week date night and weekend party collection. The current Carpe Diem collection is out now and is perfectly fitting for a sexy Halloween outfit.
