A university student uploaded pictures of himself on social media kissing 31 women, and one man, in a single night - but still ended up going home alone.

The dubious feat was the work of University of Nottingham chemistry student James Heseltine, who admitted that he 'lost count after 15'.

The 22-year-old posted pictures of all the people he kissed on photo-messaging app Snapchat.

A student uploaded pictures of himself on social media kissing 31 women, and one man, in a single night

One person criticised him for treating women 'like continents to be conquered', but he claims that he's 'no sleaze'.

The picture montage, made after a night out at Nottingham's Rock City venue, has now been viewed 8,000 times on YouTube alone and shared thousands of times around the globe.

Mr Heseltine told student paper The Tab: 'I don't want to be portrayed as an awful human.

'A lot of the people in the video are my friends and it was just a bit of fun at the time.

'It was just funny and I don't see the issue. I'm not a sleaze, it was a bit of a laugh and I was surprised how many girls I pulled.

'I must admit I lost count after 15 and only realised my final tally when I went through the pictures the next day - it was a crazy night.'

His housemate, who wished to remain unnamed, said in a post on Facebook: 'One of the all time best Snapchat stories.

'Regardless of his 31 encounters with the girls of crisis (sic), James still manages to come home alone. I just woke up to this Snapchat story. He's still in uni.'

But the student has come under fire for his actions, which are part of a student game called 'Snap Snog'.

Administration assistant Ellis De-Vaney, 25, said: 'I am not shocked by this because it is something a lot of lads are doing.

'I graduated a few weeks ago and I saw it all the time.

The dubious feat took place at Nottingham's Rock City music venue

'It is done as a game to see who can get the most on film.

'It shouldn't really be happening and it shouldn't be filmed and then shared if the other person doesn't know.'

Feminist activist Lisa Clarke has warned of a growing culture of similar incidents.

She said: 'The girls involved should also be asked before the filming and again when it is shared online.

'They aren't continents to be conquered, they are women. If it is going to be shared in any way it should be consensual for all parties.

'I know he will say it is all a bit of fun but it is a violation of trust if all those involved didn't know what was going to happen to the footage.

'There is a worrying lad culture in our universities. If it was my daughter and she was happy with it I would be fine with it, but if she was not I would suggest she takes it to the police.'
