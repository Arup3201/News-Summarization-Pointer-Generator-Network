Abi Morgan has written the play based on the couple's extraordinary relationship

Most people keep love letters as a reminder of the sweet nothings they shared.

But one couple have a slightly different memento of their relationship - a contract agreeing that she will be his mistress in exchange for him paying for her home and income.

And now the unusual - but at least organised - contract, along with recordings she made of their conversations spanning their 30-year affair, is being brought to the West End.

The real-life anonymous couple - she is 88 and he is now 93 - live in separate houses in the same city on America's west coast.

In exchange for 'mistress services', including 'All sexual acts as requested, with suspension of historical, emotional, psychological disclaimers,' he has provided her with a comfortable life.

The unconventional pair first met at university but drifted apart, before meeting again 20 years later.

They then embarked on the affair after she drew up 'The Mistress Contract', agreeing that for the duration of the Agreement, she would become his sexual property.

Part of the contract, which was neatly typed out, involves him keeping his mistress in 'tasteful accommodations to her liking together with expenses accrued in the normal course of her activities'.

In return she would, along with sexual acts, provide him with companionship when he was in the area'.

Upon receipt of the document - which she faxed to him - he phoned her immediately to accept.

London's Royal Court Theatre will host the play, which is based on an unusual 30-year contract

Their business and pleasure relationship has now formed the plot of a play written by Abi Morgan, the British screenwriter behind the Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady.

The woman describes herself as a highly educated, intelligent woman with a history of involvement in the feminist movement, the Royal Court, where the play will be performed, said.

She and her wealthy lover taped their conversations about their relationship while they ate, laid in bed and travelled.

The pair anonymously penned a book called The Mistress Contract, only signing themselves as She and He.

Their identities have understandably remained shrouded in mystery, as many question the nature of the relationship.

In the opening lines of the book, one transcribed conversation records him heaping praise on her 'audacity' and 'sheer genius' of having him sign the contract, which he says 'makes him fall in love with (her) all over again' whenever he remembers it.

Their recorded conversations cover each others views on the other's personality, criticisms, spats, loving words and sex.

The Mistress Contract is Abi Morgan's debut at London's Royal Court Theatre.

Her television credits include BBC2's The Hour and BBC 1's Birdsong, while her theatre credits include Lovesong, performed at the Lyric Hammersmith in London.

Artistic Director of the Royal Court Vicky Featherstone will direct the astonishing play, which opens in January next year.
