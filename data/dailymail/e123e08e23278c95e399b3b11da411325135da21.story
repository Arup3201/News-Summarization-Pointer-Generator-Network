England's Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch were satisfied with Commonwealth Games silver despite having led the women's synchronised 10-metre platform heading into the last round.

The Plymouth pair were in front after four of their five dives on day one of the diving competition at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh.

But, in a competitive field missing only China from the 2013 World Championships podium in the event, were overtaken on the final dive as Canada's Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion won gold with a score of 310.65.

Tuck in: Couch and Barrow certainly impressed and were unfortunate to miss out to the Canadians

Barrow and Couch finished with a score of 306.96 and Malaysia's Pamg Pandelela Rinong and Sabri Nur Dhabitah, with 300.12, claimed bronze.

Couch said: 'We were competing against silver and bronze medallists from the Worlds (in 2013 in Barcelona). We're really pleased to come second.

'We thought we might come fifth. We're really pleased with silver.

'We haven't been training the best this week. We went into competition and pulled it out the bag.'

There was a delayed start to the second event of the day due to a technical issue related to the judges' electronic scoring systems.

It meant the divers could not follow their progress on the scoreboard.

Barrow and Couch brushed aside the delay, but felt their final dive, a back two-and-a-half somersault with one-and-a-half twists, was scored low at 69.12 by the judges as the Canadian pair took gold.

'We had an inkling that we were leading,' Barrow said. 'Normally we do our last dive pretty well, so a little bit disappointed with that.

'They (the judges) didn't seem to be on our side. We're pretty happy with silver.

'Our training wasn't brilliant, so we're pretty pleased with a medal.'

Couch added: 'The judges were a little bit low on our last dive.'

Still winners: Barrow and Couch were great on the day but lost out on their fifth of five dives

Twelve out of 14 divers progressed from the men's 1m springboard preliminaries, the final of which takes place on Wednesday evening.

Three Englishmen advanced, with Jack Laugher, a former world junior champion, going through in first place with 435.30.

Chris Meares, who recovered from life-saving surgery to remove a ruptured spleen suffered while diving in 2009, finished with 383.40 in third place to advance, with Australia's Matthew Mitcham, scoring 383.65, second.

Perfection: The English pair plunge towards the pool from the high board

Freddie Woodward saved his best dive till last to total 365.45 in fourth place, while Yona Knight-Wisdom, who is representing Jamaica but was born in Leeds, scored 333.10 to progress in eighth.

James Heatly, grandson of five-time Games diving medallist Sir Peter Heatly, was 10th entering the final round, but left his most difficult dive until last, an inward two-and-a-half somersault.

The 17-year-old from Edinburgh scored 54.25 to total 317.65 and advance in 10th place.
