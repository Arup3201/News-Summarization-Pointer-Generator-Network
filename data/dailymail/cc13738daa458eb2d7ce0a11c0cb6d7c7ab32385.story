A bridge collapse that sent cars and drivers plunging into the Skagit River in Washington State was caused by an over-sized truck that collided with the span of structure, authorities have said.

'For reasons unknown at this point in time the semi struck the overhead of the bridge causing the collapse,' State Patrol Chief John Batiste revealed at an overnight news conference.

The truck made it off the bridge and the driver remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators, he added.

Three passengers were pulled alive from their vehicles after they plunged tens of feet into the water below at around 7pm on Thursday. Even more were pulled from the debris, but rescuers said no one died in the dramatic accident and all victims have been accounted for.

Rush hour: The bridge over the Skagit River collapsed shortly before 7pm on Thursday causing a number of passenger-filled cars to fall into the water below

Revelations: The bridge was reportedly listed as one of the state's structurally deficient bridges 

Rescue effort: Workers form a human chain as they begin to remove a woman from a vehicle in the water

Lucky escape: A man is seen sitting atop a car that fell into the Skagit River after the bridge collapse

As the rescue operation remains 
underway, it was revealed that the bridge was previously recognized by 
state authorities as being 'functionally obsolete' as a result of 
certain structural changes that required attention.

The I-5 runs through the state, 
crossing the Skagit River at a number of different points, but the 
bridge where the collapse happened was between Burlington and Mount 
Vernon. 

Both the north and southbound lanes 
of the bridge fell into the water, and as such both directions of the 
highway have been closed in the area.

There
 were early eyewitness reports that people watching were screaming that a
 man was stuck inside his truck that fell in the water during the 
collapse.

Damage: The first pictures of the scene show that both the north and southbound lanes of the Interstate highway collapsed on Thursday evening just before 7pm

Rescue: Three people were initially pulled from the water alive, though there remained concerns about other possible passengers who were trapped by debris

Collapse: The section of the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River is seen in an aerial view

Jeremiah Thomas, a volunteer firefighter, said he was driving in the area when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye.

'The bridge just went down, it crashed through the water,' he said. 'It was really surreal.'

At least two vehicles - a car and the pickup with a trailer attached - fell into the river, officials said.

Vehicles in the water, which is about 15 ft deep at the point of the incident, could be seen bobbing on the surface and were likely resting on collapsed portions of the bridge.

Dan Sligh and his wife were in their 
pickup truck on Interstate 5 heading to a camping trip when a bridge 
before them disappeared in a 'big puff of dust', he said.

'I hit the brakes and we went off,' 
Sligh said from hospital, adding he 'saw the water approaching ... you 
hold on as tight as you can.'

Desperate search: Eyewitnesses said that they could hear a man screaming from one of the trucks that fell in the water

Troubled water: Both the north and south bound lanes of the interstate were effected so much of the nearby highway was closed in order to prevent any other accidents

Scary: Though the water was not particularly deep where the collapse occurred, there were a number of other factors that could prove threatening for the passengers inside the cars, like this overturned one

Questions: There are unconfirmed reports that a large truck hit something to unsteady the bridge but investigators are still looking into what caused the unexpected collapse

Sligh, who was dumped into the chilly
 waters with his wife and another man in a different vehicle, dislocated
 his shoulder in the plunge. He managed to pop it back in to place 
before calling out to his wife, who he described as being in shock.

The three victims were taken to 
Skagit Valley Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The other man
 was reported in stable condition at United General Hospital in 
Sedro-Woolley, hospital CEO Greg Reed said.

Officials were quick to note that it 
would not be a massive accident, as highway trooper Mark Francis told 
local station King 5 News that because the bridge is in a relatively 
rural area, he does not expect mass casualties.

The bridge, which was built in 1955, was inspected twice last year and repairs were made, Transportation Secretary Lynn Peterson said.

'It's an older bridge that needs a lot of work just like a good number of bridges around the state,' she said.

Hopeful: Crowds gathered on the river bank as the rescue crews bring survivors out of the water

Viewing the scene: Crowds gathered on the top of the bridge as they tried to assess the damage

Location: The bridge itself is in a rather remote area between the towns of Burlington and Mount Vernon but the interstate itself is a major thoroughfare that connects Seattle to Canada

Officials are now working on plans for either a temporary or permanent replacement, she said.

According to a blog that monitors 
transportation reports, the 2010 inspection called for an estimated 
$1,035,000 in repairs to bring the bridge and its connection to the 
surrounding riverbank up to satisfactory levels.

The bridge was not classified as structurally deficient, but the Federal Highway Administration listed it as being 'functionally obsolete' - meaning the design is outdated, such as having low clearance.

The bridge has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100, according to federal records, which is well below the statewide average rating of 80, according to an Associated Press analysis.
