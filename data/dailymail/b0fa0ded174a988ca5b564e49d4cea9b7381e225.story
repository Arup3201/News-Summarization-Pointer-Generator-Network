Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is clearly in the mood to celebrate as his Saints side continues to challenge the Premier League’s big guns in the pursuit of European qualification.

The Saints currently lie fourth, one point behind United and one ahead of Arsenal, with only 13 games left to fight for a place in the Champions League next season.

Koeman posted a picture on Twitter on Sunday at a Southampton party as his side have a week off, having been knocked out of the FA Cup, before playing Liverpool on February 22 next weekend.

The Dutchman added the caption: ‘Party time! #saintsfc’ to the picture, which shows Koeman with colleagues in masks, as Southampton enjoyed some time away from the relentless Premier League season.

Koeman was recently named Barclays Manager of the Month for January after guiding Southampton to victories over Champions League qualification rivals Arsenal and Manchester United.

After an impressive January, Southampton have endured a mixed February, opening with a defeat by Swansea before edging out Queens Park Rangers and were held to a goalless draw by 10-man West Ham on Wednesday.
