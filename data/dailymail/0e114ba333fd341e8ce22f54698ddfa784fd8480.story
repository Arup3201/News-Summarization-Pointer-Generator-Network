A retired policeman is back behind the wheel of his old patrol car - almost 40 years since they last cruised the streets together.

Ex-constable Tony Peters, 67, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was stunned when he saw the Ford Cortina Mark II Lotus police car while flicking through an edition of Classic Cars on holiday last year.

The limited edition high-performance vehicle was once the enemy of many a villain on the Mid-Anglia police force patch four decades ago.

Tony instantly recognised the picture of himself and colleague PC John Cooper standing next their old friend 'Tango 8 in 1972.

The pair used to patrol the county together in much the same way as officers in the popular 1960s TV show Z-Cars.

Now, 40 years after they were snapped, Tony has been reunited with the cult car.

The former bobby last drove his beloved souped-up squad car in 1974 before it was sold at auction for £300.

The 1970 Cortina, which packed a 1600cc, 109bhp Lotus engine, finally emerged from under a dust cover in 2006.

Car enthusiast Steve 'Ozzy' Osborne bought the exclusive motor, which could hit 108mph, for just £500 intending to use only its engine and sell the rest for scrap.

But Ozzy changed his mind after researching the car's history and decided to restore the rare vehicle - thought to be one of just two ever made for the police.

Tony said this particular Cortina Lotus was built specially for the police and could out-perform other traffic motors at the time by more than 20mph.

'Ford made us the four-door version of the car because we couldn't ask criminals to climb over the front seats,' he said.

'It had a sports engine in a normal car and could do 0-60mph in nine seconds. I suppose for police cars these days it's more like five.'

Tony joined the force in 1962 and transferred to the traffic unit in 1970, where he stayed until he left in 1994.

The picture was taken by a Crime Scenes Investigation officer at the scene of a fatal accident on the A604 between Spalding and Bythorn, he said.

'I hadn't seen the image before I saw it in the magazine because I forgot to pick it up,' he said.

The glamorous and highly sought-after Ford has been on show at Cambridgeshire Police HQ in Hinchingbrooke.

'Seeing the car again was brilliant,' said Tony.

'Ozzy has done a really good job at getting it back into its former state. I got to drive it again. It didn't feel exactly the same as it did all those years ago but I'm so glad that it was saved from the scrapyard.

'It brought back many flashbacks of running blood samples and transplant organs to Papworth Hospital.

'We could get there about five minutes quicker than any other squad car.

But
seeing the old car next to the current police fleet of Audi 7 series 
shows just how much technology and motoring has changed over the years.'

The
Cortina Lotus is now worth more than £16,000 and Ozzy hopes to restage 
the 40-year-old photo of Tony and PC Cooper with their old motor at the 
same spot.

The
ex-police car's story will be completed when it meets its sister - 
which is close to being fully restored by a Ford mechanic in Kent.
