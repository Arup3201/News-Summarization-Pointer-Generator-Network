After making an embarrassing blunder over foreign policy earlier this week, Herman Cain must have thought his geographical woes were behind him.

But the presidential candidate outdid himself on the campaign trail yesterday after sampling local delicacies in Miami's Cuban community before asking: 'How do you say delicious in Cuban?'

The GOP White House contender may have later realised that the national language of Cuba is in fact Spanish.

Gaffe: Herman Cain had been sampling local delicacies in Little Havana, Miami, when he made the embarrassing blunder

Cain's latest linguistic blunder has capped a testing week for the presidential candidate

The gaffe did not seem to be too badly received by the assembled locals in Little Havana, where Cain had stopped for a scheduled visit.

After sampling Cuban coffee and 'croquetas' of fried cheese and asking, 'How do you say delicious in Cuban?' an audience member humoured the presidential hopeful by answering, 'Delicioso'.

Cain had stopped in South Florida yesterday to court voters in the state's Cuban-American and Jewish communities.

The same day, Cain managed to blunder again when he misstated the year of one of his own political party's finest moments.

In a speech at a rally at the Palm Beach County Convention Center, he said Republicans won back the House of Representatives from the Democrats in 2008, when in fact it happened last year.

Memory lapse: Herman Cain hesitated when asked if he agreed with Obama's decision to back Libyan rebels in overthrowing Gaddafi in a video interview earlier this week

Uncomfortable: Cain fidgeted in his chair and crossed his legs as he struggled for words

He said: 'When the American people begin to ignite that American spirit, they make things happen, just like they made things happen in 2008 when the Republicans took back control of the House.'

It has been a testing week for Cain on the campaign trail, as earlier this week he had fumbled when quizzed on foreign policy in Libya.

The 65-year-old suffered his own Rick Perry 'Oops' moment when quizzed on his stance on Libya.

He seemed to be at a loss for words when the editorial board of a Wisconsin newspaper asked if he supported President Obama's handling of the Libyan uprising.

Video footage of the interview shows Cain squirming in his chair and not offering any kind of substantial answer for over a minute.

When asked about his Wisconsin meltdown yesterday, Cain didn't exactly make his stance clear.

Support: Gloria Cain spoke during a Fox News interview, saying her husband has 'too much respect for women' for the sexual harassment claims to be true

Happier times: Gloria Cain accompanies her husband Herman in May as he announces his run as a Republican candidate for President. She has spoken out in his defence as he battles sexual harassment allegations

He said: 'I get criticised, "Well he doesn’t have extensive foreign policy experience,"’ Cain said, before then saying in reference to Obama: 'And the guy there now does?'

Cain's number in the polls have dipped of late, especially with female voters following allegations of sexual harassment made against him.

However, the presidential candidate and former boss of the National Restaurant Association has denied any wrongdoing.

He has also been supported by his wife, who said in a Fox News interview that her husband 'has too much respect for women for any of the allegations to be true'.
