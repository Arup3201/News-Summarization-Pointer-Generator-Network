Manchester City remain an enigma to me. On Sunday they face their main rivals for the title in Chelsea and they have been transformed as a club since Sheik Mansour took them over in 2008. 

That said, the owners have invested £865million in the club in the six years in which they have owned it yet I still can’t quite grasp their true identity.

On their day, they can be something special. Look at their results against Manchester United in the past three seasons. In six Premier League games they have scored 18 goals against them and won five of those games. And in the majority of those encounters they have been absolutely brilliant.

Man City can dazzle, but they have also showed their weaknesses this season, losing to Stoke at home

The pace of their game, the way they have moved the ball, the speed of their attacks and their strength at the back have been too much for United. 

They are on a completely different level and those performances have been close to 10/10 displays. On days like that you’re left wondering whether they can challenge Real Madrid and Barcelona.

But I don’t see them hitting those heights nearly enough. If you catch City on an off day you can definitely takes points off them, as Stoke did the other week. 

And there are far too many of those days for a club of their aspirations.

When I think about the great Premier League teams such as Manchester United and Arsenal in the 1990s and 2000s, players like Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo would put in performances that were 8/10 every single week. 

And if you happened to catch them on a good day, they would be 9/10 or close to 10/10. At City, I think you could say that Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany meet that standard but not enough of their other key players. Too many can have sleepy days when they’re well below their best.

Maybe it’s because of the changes in managers over the last six years but their identity in terms of the playing style is an issue for me. 

They’re not a team that will retreat into a solid shape and defend deep. But I don’t see them as a free-flowing team, as Manchester United were in their heyday; they don’t play with the freedom of wide wingers.

I don’t know if they want to be an open team who will go out and play with flair and to win simply because we’ve got better players than you. They’re not a team that will defend deep and make it difficult for teams and then hit them on the break. They want to control games but I’m not sure they have midfielders who are consistent enough to do that.

It’s very early days but City’s start to the season has been unsure and stuttering, putting them under extra pressure on Sunday because they don’t want to see the five-point gap behind Chelsea increase.

They need to ensure that they don’t fall into the trap of one season on and one season off, as they did after finally winning the title in 2012. They seemed to drop off in their intensity the following season and just at the moment you might be seeing the start of something similar. 

With the money that has been invested, I would imagine that the owners would want to see back-to-back Premier League titles or a Champions League semi-final or final this season but, right now, I would put Jose Mourinho’s team ahead of them. 

The likes of Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp would put in 8/10 performances every week

In six Premier League games against Man United, City have scored 18 goals against them and won five 

It’s partly why Sunday's contest is so fascinating. City were outwitted in the equivalent fixture last season on another of those all-too-familiar off days, even if they got their revenge shortly after in the FA Cup.

But City are Premier League champions. They need to start dominating like champions and asserting themselves. And if they summon one of their better performances, then they can start that process on Sunday.

Manchester City have too many 'sleepy' players, and Chelsea are currently looking stronger

Chelsea have won every game this season in the Premier League, having played four

Costa is the missing link for Chelsea

Diego Costa is the real deal as a striker.

His attributes look tailor-made for English football.

He has a bit of everything about him. He is great at holding the ball up, has enough speed to get in behind defenders, can work the 18-yard box and is clearly not going to be intimidated by physical opponents.

Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea City last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt 

I would put his former Atletico team-mate, Radamel Falcao, just ahead of him overall but he still looks like the missing link for Chelsea. They — as Atletico before them — have worked out how to play in the way that suits him best, which Spain, with their short intricate passing, didn’t manage in the World Cup.

Together with Cesc Fabregas, he has formed a wonderful understanding and Chelsea look a better side than last season — and that’s after having made a profit of transfers in the summer.

Fabregas looks to be the perfect replacement for Frank Lampard. He might not score as many but he will create more. I would imagine he’ll play just behind Costa at Manchester City on Sunday, with Ramires and Nemanja Matic sitting in the deeper positions to add a bit more solidity.

Fabregas has slotted seamlessly back into English football following his arrival back from Barcelona

You might have thought it would take Chelsea three or four months for their new signings to settle in but Costa, Fabregas and Thibaut Courtois have adapted straight away, which is why I have them as title favourites.

They don’t need to win on Sunday; a draw would do them fine. Jose Mourinho always said that this was the season on which we should judge him and, so far, that’s looking like a good call.

Poor Yaya deserves time to recover

The player who has received the most criticism for his midfield performances and his inconsistency this week has been Yaya Toure.

The 31-year-old has been instrumental in the reshaping of Manchester City and been a powerhouse in midfield in their title-winning seasons.

But behind every dip in form, there is always a back story. We don’t know exactly what the reason is with Yaya but we do know his brother, Ibrahim, died in the summer. Sometimes we simply analyse players as though they are footballing machines but the raw emotion of such a tragedy can’t fail to have an impact in some way.

It is something I’ve been through recently. Yaya was not at his best against Bayern Munich and he does look a little detached since the World Cup.

I would guess he needs some time and space to get back to his best. Given what he has contributed to City, he’s earned that right.
