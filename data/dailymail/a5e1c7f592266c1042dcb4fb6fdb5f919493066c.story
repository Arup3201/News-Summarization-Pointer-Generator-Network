Rhian Jeremiah, 26 of Cardigan, west Wales, who caused £220 of criminal damage on a car by biting it outside a takeaway in Aberystwyth

A woman bit into a car roof after a roadside argument with three strangers on a night out.

Rhian Jeremiah, 26, from Cardigan in west Wales, left teethmarks in the bodywork of the white Fiat 500 - and was likened in court to villain Jaws from the James Bond movies.

The victims heard a 'crunching sound' when Jeremiah bit the metal of the car, which caused £220 worth of damage.

Car owner Selina Day, 23, and her two friends were parked outside of a takeaway restaurant called Lip Licking Chicken at 2am when Jeremiah, who had been drinking, approached.

She became aggressive, shouting unintelligibly, and tried to wrench open the passenger door.

The occupants then then looked up through the sun roof to see Jeremiah biting the frame above the door.

She sank her teeth into the car's frame between the roof and the door and the occupants heard a 'loud metal screeching'.

Jeremiah had been drinking at a memorial night for her late boyfriend Simon Jones who drowned off the coast of Aberystwyth, west Wales.

Aberystwyth magistrates court heard 
that she bit the car she had been retracing his last known movements in 
Aberystwyth on what would have been his birthday.

Car owner Miss Day told the court: 'She came up to the car and tried to rip the door open.

'I couldn't understand what she was saying - she was very drunk and was abusive.

'There was a bit of an argument and she sunk her teeth into the part of the car above the window. I could hear metal crunching.

'I had never seen this lady before in my life. I didn't know what she was talking about.'

Jeremiah had denied causing criminal damage to the car by biting it but was eventually found guilty.

She was given a 12-month community order and told to attend 20 alcohol abuse help sessions.

Chairman of the bench Professor Ian Roffe told her: 'You have used alcohol inappropriately to deal with your issues.'
