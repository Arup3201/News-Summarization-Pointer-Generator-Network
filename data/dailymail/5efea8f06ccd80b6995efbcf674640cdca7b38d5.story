Pittsburgh Penguins forward Pascal Dupuis is expected to be out for at least six months after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his lung, the National Hockey League team announced on Wednesday.

'Pascal had a blood clot in his leg that traveled to his lung,' said Pittsburgh team doctor Dharmesh Vyas. 'In medical terms, that is a deep vein thrombosis resulting in a pulmonary embolism.'

This is not the first time the 35-year-old Canadian has been diagnosed with blood clot problems. In January, Dupuis was treated for a blood clot following knee surgery.

Doctors put him on blood thinners at the time and will continue with that treatment for his latest problem. 

'This is the second such incident that we know of for Pascal,' Vyas said. 

'The treatment is at least six months of blood thinners, during which time he will not be able to play hockey. Other than that, his condition is stable.'

The news comes less than a week after Dupuis delivered one of his best games of the season, scoring two goals on eight shots in the Penguins 2-1 win over Toronto.

The Penguins said the clot was discovered Monday after Dupuis had complained of chest pain.

Dupuis has six goals and five assists in 16 games this season. He missed the majority of the 2013-14 season after tearing his ACL.
