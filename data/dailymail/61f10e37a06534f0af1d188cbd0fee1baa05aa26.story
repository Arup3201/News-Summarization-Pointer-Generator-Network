The Taliban have reportedly captured an former US military base in the western Afghan province of Farah.

The news was released through a 16 minute video, in which dozens of Taliban fighters are shown being driven into the fortified base. 

The white flag of the Taliban is also shown being unfurled by one of the militants whilst another scene shows one of the group's leaders making a lengthy speech in Pashto.

The white flags of the Taliban can be seen being unfurled over the buildings as the fighters swarm into the former US military base.

A senior Taliban leader is shown making a speech, declaring that the military base had been liberated by the Taliban.

The video shows footage of  well-built fortitications of the former US base, once used to tackle the local trade in heroin in Farah province.

The Taliban's exaggerated report ignores the fact that the base had not been used by NATO forces for over a year. American troops have not been operating from Bakwa base since March 2013.

Multiple convoys of white estate cars are shown being driven into the compound, parking inside the fort walls. 

Fighters dressed in traditional Afghan dress and armed with machine guns can be seen getting out of the cars and gathering outside Bakwa district's headquarters building.

The low quality footage was recently released in Pashto by al-Emarah media, the Taliban's official multimedia branch.

The desert province, situated near the Iranian border, has become a growing area for Taliban re-resurgence. The base was reportedly captured after a lengthy siege.

Growing fears remain that the Taliban are developing Farah province into their new hub for launching greater attacks on cities like Kabul.

The low quality footage was poorly produced by al-Emarah media, the Taliban's official multimedia branch. 

According to a short statement released along with the video, Bakwa base was captured by the Taliban after a prolonged siege.

The media branch also wrote: 'It is hoped that this release brings joy of our viewers.' Overexcited Taliban supporters on social media have already insisted that the radical group of jihadis will re-take Kabul soon. 

Farah is predominantly a desert province, with only a small local population. It was an important base for NATO troops due to its strategic location on the main highway between Herat and Kandahar.

The news comes after Farid Bakhtawar, head of Farah's provincial council told local media about the threat posed by the Taliban in Farah province.

'The district of Bakwa is the center for weapons, dealing drugs, and the Taliban's main base in the west zone.'
