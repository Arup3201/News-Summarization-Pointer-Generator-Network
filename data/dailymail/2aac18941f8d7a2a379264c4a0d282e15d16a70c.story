There may not be much cause for cheer at Ibrox of late, but at least Kenny McDowall can celebrate achieving a feat which eluded his predecessor this term.

Three times Ally McCoist failed to beat lowly Alloa — the third a humbling 3-2 reversal in the Petrofac Training Cup semi-final.

That capitulation from 2-0 up with 13 minutes to play sparked the beginning of the end for McCoist, but McDowall’s men went some way to making amends by grinding out a scrappy, 1-0 win, courtesy of Nicky Law’s first-half strike.

It says a great deal, however, that such a result can be taken as progress.

Before plummeting into financial turmoil, Rangers were on the brink of achieving four successive top-flight titles.

In Clackmannanshire on Saturday, they only narrowly avoided a rather more ignominious four in a row. The visitors were second-best for large stretches of this open contest, which came at the end of another eventful week for the club.

Sandy Easdale took up his seat at the Indodrill Stadium amid growing concerns for his powerbase at Ibrox. Last week, takeover bids were tabled by American financier Robert Sarver, while the Three Bears — Douglas Park, George Taylor and George Letham — snapped up shares as they sought regime change.

Footballing matters were also a source of speculation with Ian Cathro and Felix Magath linked with coaching positions.

It almost seemed fitting, then, that the latest tumultuous spell should culminate in a clash with their bogey team.

Just six who started in the Alloa defeat did so here — Kyle Hutton making only his second start of the season — but that December night seemed to play on the visitors’ minds in the opening exchanges.

Unsurprisingly, Alloa started the game without fear. In the opening minutes, Stephen Simmons even added a touch of samba flair to the chilly surroundings, beating Nicky Law with a cheeky backheel.

And the hosts almost snatched an early lead when Liam Buchanan chipped Steve Simonsen — the ball dropping inches wide of the far post.

It took Rangers 15 minutes to get the monkey off their backs. Jon Daly was given space in the area to fizz a low ball across the six-yard box which Law gleefully turned in.

Yet Alloa dug in and frustrated their opponents. Simmons and Ryan McCord proved a handful for Kyle Hutton in the middle of the park, giving the 23-year-old little time on the ball.

But, with the snow billowing, Rangers should have doubled their lead. Kenny Miller raced clear of the Alloa defence but crashed his shot against the inside of the post. The hosts were equally capable of threatening, though, and left-winger Kevin Cawley saw his curling right-footed effort deflected high and wide.

As Rangers burst forwards, Daly found David Templeton in space on the right of the box but the winger’s low shot found the legs of Craig McDowall.

Templeton then turned provider, picking an excellent through pass to split the Wasps’ defence to find Miller. McDowall once again blocked with his legs to deny the veteran frontman.

Rangers pushed in search of a second and Miller almost grabbed it in style. Richard Foster, afforded too much space down the right flank, pumped in a cross which Miller met with a cute, backheeled volley which was saved.

At the back, Rangers looked suspect and Alloa sensed an equaliser. As the visitors struggled to clear their lines, Simmons hit a feeble shot from the edge of the box presented at Simonsen.

Alloa could count themselves unlucky to be behind at the break after Mark Docherty whipped a dangerous free-kick which narrowly missed the head of team-mate Ben Gordon.

Rangers were calmer when play restarted, content to dominate possession and keep their slender advantage.

McDowall was eventually called into action on the hour when he fumbled Daly’s 30-yard piledriver. Simonsen was kept busy soon afterwards, though, as Cawley slid in to beat Darren McGregor and direct a bobbling effort at the stopper.

Wasps boss Smith rolled the dice midway through the half by adding an extra striker in Spence, Rangers’ tormentor-in-chief here last month. Rangers responded by throwing on Kris Boyd and Fraser Aird and the latter injected a turn of pace his side were desperately lacking.

The winger unleashed a powerful right-footed shot which McDowall parried.

Spence — unbeaten in his career against Rangers — almost embarrassed the Ibrox men once more, but Simonsen reacted superbly to save his thunderous 30-yard free-kick at the death.
