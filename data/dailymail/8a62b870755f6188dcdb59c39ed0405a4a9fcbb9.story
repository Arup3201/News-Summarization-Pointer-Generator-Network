Amanda Bynes has gone on yet another disturbing Twitter rant.Â 

In a lengthy message posted on Tuesday, she again accused the NYPD of 'illegally entering' her apartment and sexually harassing her before her arrest last week and also claimed to be allergic to drugs and alcohol.

She described herself as 'innocent' and then told her fans: 'Look forward to seeing me in music videos! I'm getting in shape and getting a nose job! I'm looking forward to a long and wonderful career as a singer/rapper!'

On May 5 she told her fans that she had gone under the knife to get rid of skin that was like 'webbing' between her nose and eyes.

In a second rambling message on Monday, she also denied claims she lashed out at Rihanna on Tby saying Chris Brown beat her because she is 'not pretty enough'.

She insisted the tweets to Rihanna, which referenced the violent 2009 attack, were 'mocked up'.

Rant: The actress' latest bizarre Twitter post in full

The exchange on Sunday read: 'Chris Brown beat you because you're not pretty enough,' before adding: '@Rihanna no one wants to be your lover so you call everyone and their mother that I almost named my new dog Rihanna.'

Rihanna, who recently ended her relationship with Chris and is said to be heartbroken that he appears to have rekindled his romance with his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran, hit back, writing: 'Ya see what happens when they cancel Intervention?'

In tweets that have since been deleted, the actress appeared to respond: '@Rihanna unlike ur fugly faced self I don't do drugs! U need the intervention dog! I met ur ugly face in person! U aren't pretty u know it.'

But now Amanda denies being responsible for the messages, saying: 'I saw a bunch of mocked up tweets about me bashing Rihanna in my mentions. I'm followed by so many people that someone is always mocking up fake tweets.'

Amanda was charged with attempted evidence tampering, reckless endangerment and marijuana possession in court on Friday and is due back in court next month.

The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau is looking into the serious allegations first made by actress is a lengthy Twitter rant on Saturday, during which she accused an officer of entering her apartment illegally, slapping her vagina and lying about her throwing a bong out the window in front of him.

Amanda's parents Lynn and Rick are reportedly worried she is bipolar or schizophrenic but cannot force her to undergo a mental evaluation.

In the bizarre hate-bender, Amanda has tended towards racist themes 
but has generally followed it them by claiming that she is, in fact, not racist.

She also continues to insist that she does not do drugs or drink alcohol, and cites others that do.

In the same paragraph that Amanda denied writing offensive and racist tweets about Rihanna and said that she's sure they'll 'be in a music video together one day', she also asked 'Why does Rihanna smoke weed and not get in trouble for it,'

The troubled girl was also sure to add: 'Thankfully, I'm an educated multi-millionaire', to conclude an utterly confusing and disturbing rant.
