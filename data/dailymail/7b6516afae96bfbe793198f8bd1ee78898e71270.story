An aspiring model has been arrested on suspicion of drunk driving after allegedly causing a fatal crash while her children sat in the back of her car.

Reena Ashlie Sanchez, 24, was arrested for manslaughter and child endangerment following the crash in Sacramento that killed a man in the early hours of Sunday, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Sanchez, who has glamorous pictures listed on numerous modelling sites across California, says she's an aspiring model, actress and dancer in her online resume.

Killed: A 30-year-old man was killed in the incident around 3.45am on Sunday. Three other passengers and the driver of the SUV escaped without being seriously hurt

On her MySpace page she says her goals are 'to have a career and to be a wonderful mommy and person in general'.

Under weaknesses she lists 'being to [sic] nice'.

Officers say 'intoxicated' Sanchez was driving down El Camino Avenue near Colfax Street around 3.45am with her two toddlers, aged 1 and 2, sitting in booster seats in the back of her sedan.

Her speeding car allegedly stuck another vehicle from behind causing it to spin off the road.

The other vehicle, an SUV, collided with a tree with such force that the two backseat passengers were thrown onto the road.

One, a 30-year-old man, was declared dead at the scene while the other passenger was rushed to hospital.

Sanchez was also taken to hospital before being booked into Sacramento County Jail at 11.30am yesterday.

The SUV's driver did not require treatment while the other two passengers in the car were in said to be in a stable condition.

Sanchez's children were also taken to hospital but were said to be unharmed.

They are now in the custody of Child Protective Services.

No other cars were involved in the incident.

Police claim the case is an example of the dangers of driving under the influence which they often see on the Super Bowl weekend.

Sacramento police spokeswoman, Michele Gigante, said: 'We have patrols out looking for drunken drivers after the Super Bowl. We are asking people to have a plan if they are going to drink. Think about the implications and how life can change in a moment.'
