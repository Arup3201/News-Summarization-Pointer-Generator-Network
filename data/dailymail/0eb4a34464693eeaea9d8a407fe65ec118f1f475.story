This is the hilarious moment a tourist was photobombed by a deer as she tried to snap a keepsake photo of one of the Scottish Highlands’ iconic mountains.

Alison Neilly, 43, wound up getting an unforgettable shot thanks to the curious animal’s interest in her camera.

The amusing encounter occurred when Alison, from Kinlochleven, stopped to capture the scene as mist descended on the 3,350ft Buachaille Etive Mor at Glencoe. 

Oh deer! The friendly hind pokes her head into Alison Neilly's photograph of Buachaille Etive Mor

Say cheese: The deer licks its lips while Alison Neilly attempts to snap a keepsake photo of the iconic peak

But just as Alison snapped what should have been a magnificent picture the friendly deer poked her head into the shot, licking her lips for good measure.

Alison said: ‘When I was crouching down to get the pictures it just put its head in the way.’

The snack bar worker uploaded the pictures to an online profile, with the caption: ‘Buachaille Etive Mor and a cheeky young hind who wanted in on the shot too’.

The images have proved a big hit with animal lovers.

Morag Hammond wrote: ‘A great photobomb.’

And Tony McClumpha joked: ‘It was looking for Santa.’

The picture was taken outside the remote Kings House Hotel, built in the 17th century and believed to be one of Scotland's oldest licensed inns.

Pictures emerged earlier in the month of a deer at the same spot snacking on a Kit Kat.
