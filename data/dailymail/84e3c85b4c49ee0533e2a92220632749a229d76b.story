The father of a student blinded in one eye in an unprovoked attack by a  teenager yesterday condemned police for letting him go with just a telling-off.

The latest shocking example of ‘soft justice’ occurred after Matthew Noblett, 20, intervened to protect a female friend who was being verbally abused by a gang of teens.

One lashed out at him, resulting in horrific injuries which caused his right eyeball to deflate. Despite a five-hour operation involving 170 stitches, his sight could not be restored, and he may lose the eyeball altogether.

Furious: Matthew Noblett was blinded in his right eye during the attack but the perpetrator was let off with a caution

But because police and doctors were 
initially unaware of the severity of Matthew’s injuries, his 16-year-old
attacker was let off with a reprimand – a youth caution which means he 
wasn’t even given a criminal record.

The let-off emerged days after figures
revealed that more than 500,000 criminals have been given cautions for 
serious crimes – including almost 8,000 violent assaults – in the past 
15 years.

That is despite the Lord Chief 
Justice, Director of Public Prosecutions and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate 
of Constabulary all expressing concern at the number of out-of-court 
penalties being issued by police.

As Matthew told yesterday how the assault had ruined his life, his landscape gardener father Joseph, 45, said he felt betrayed.

Bloodied: Matthew said police initially thought he only suffered cuts and bruises  in the attack

‘I’ve got no respect for what the 
police have done. I got a £60 fine for having the spacing on my private 
registration plate wrong.

'Yet this lad has left my son blind in one eye 
and gets off scot-free. Where’s the justice in that? Matthew will now be
affected for the rest of his life.’

Matthew, who is studying environmental
management at university in Preston, was attacked last August after 
going for drinks with friends.

‘As we got out on to the street we 
noticed around 50 teens,’ he said.

‘One started shouting abuse to my 
friend’s girlfriend and I quietly told him to “Leave her alone”.

‘He carried on being aggressive, so I 
told him to “leave it”. He squared up to me, screaming in my face and 
then I felt an almighty blow to my eyebrow.’

Matthew was taken to hospital where 
his injuries – at first thought to be merely a cut eyebrow – were 
photographed.

He said: ‘I didn’t think it was anything serious, 
especially when I was sent home.’

The next day, his doctor covered his 
left eye and asked him to read from a board. ‘I said “What board?” and 
he looked into my eye and said, “Oh dear”.

Dad and I broke down. I’d 
always said going blind would be the worst thing.

Matthew, who lives in 
Coppull, Lancashire, with his father, mother Louise and sister Kate, 16,
added: ‘I’m shaking with rage that more isn’t being done to get justice
in this matter.’

A police spokesman said: ‘We are aware
that (Matthew’s) eyesight has since begun to deteriorate, and we are 
reviewing the case with the CPS.’

Deflated: Doctors discovered a haemorrhage in Matthew's eye and a tear meant it had no pressure and was deflating

Surgery: Matthew needed 170 stitches in his eye to stop it deflating
