Alastair Cook has said he is happy with Jimmy Anderson’s on-field behaviour and will not be asking the leader of his attack to tone down the verbals in Thursday’s fourth Investec Test in Manchester.

Cook’s defence of Anderson came only a couple of hours after the ICC chief executive David Richardson said he would not be appealing against Justice Gordon Lewis’s decision to exonerate both Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja following their set-to in the Trent Bridge pavilion last month.

But Richardson also warned that there was there was ‘no place in the game for the use of offensive language that is personally insulting of one player by another’ – a statement that seemed aimed squarely at Anderson following events in Nottingham.

Cook admitted he had never played with a cricketer whose off-field and on-field personas were as different as Anderson’s. But he said: ‘I don’t think anyone should moan about it, because what happens on the field should stay on the field and off the field you should be a nice guy.

‘The way both sides have played this series has been fantastic, about from that one incident which has been blown up. Both sides have been very competitive and played it in the right spirit.

‘Every time you pull on the shirt you’re role models for kids. We’re aware of that, but we want to play competitive cricket, not nicey nicey, and everyone say you’re playing in the right spirit. There’s always that muddied line.

‘We want to play competitive cricket, don’t need to change too much. I am happy with Jimmy Anderson and his conduct. There are little bits where he might have overstepped the mark but I’d rather he was on that line than too passive. He needs that for his bowling.

‘Jimmy’s an experienced cricketer and he’s found his method that he needs to be England’s second-leading wicket taker. I'm pretty sure he'll be England's leading wicket taker very soon and that's an outstanding achievement. He's found his way of doing it.

‘I know it’s very special for him to play at a home Test match. For him to be playing here means a lot for him. That was his biggest concern, that he wouldn’t be able to play at Old Trafford.’

Cook also praised Steven Finn for fighting back from a situation in Australia where he was deemed ‘unselectable’. Finn could play his first Test for 13 months if he’s picked on a surface that is expected to suit his height and bounce – with Chris Jordan the man most likely to miss out.

Cook said: ‘It’s great, from where I last saw him in an England shirt in that one-day tour, to what he’s now delivering for Middlesex, and briefly how bowled to us in the nets at Lord’s and here these last two days as well.

‘It’s great for English cricket that he’s back to his best. He’s very different to what we’ve got. He’s a tall bowler who when he gets it right bowls at 90mph. 

'That’s a good thing to add to the pot. It’s been a very tough six months for him personally to fight through it, and I think he’ll be a stronger bloke for it. It should bode well for his cricket.’

Meanwhile, India captain MS Dhoni said he had no regrets over pursuing the case against Anderson, and said it was up to individual captains to control their players.

But he said match officials should play a greater role in ensuring the game is played in the right spirit: ‘It’s important that cricket has strong characters – no matter what side they play for. But what needs to be done is for umpires to step in if the individual crosses the line. If the individual stays within the guidelines, it’s good for the game.

‘If he carries on being abusive and cannot curb his instincts, he should definitely be punished.’
