Accused: Michael J. Sato has been charged with theft, he claims it was all a misunderstanding

A wealthy real estate executive allegedly stole three designer ties from Bloomingdale's on Black Friday

Michael J. Sato, 44, is accused of swiping three Burberry ties from the Chicago branch of the department store while on a shopping trip with his children.

Sato, who is president of Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty, has been charged with shoplifting.

According to court documents seen by ABC News, a security guard said he spotted Sato tucking two ties into his pocket and another into a shopping bag.

He then as watched Sato walked past the tills without paying for the $145 ties.

Sato’s lawyer told the Chicago Sun Times it was purely a misunderstanding in the Black Friday shopping crush.

'It was just a mistake. It was busy. He had his kids with him, it was crowded.' defense attorney Jon Erickson said.

Erickson called Sato a 'highly respected' member of the community who did not intend to take the merchandise.

Sato was unavailable for comment.
