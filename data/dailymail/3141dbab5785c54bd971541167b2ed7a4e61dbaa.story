An American Airlines flight was delayed for 17 hours at LAX because a passenger spotted an 'Al-Quida Free Terror Nettwork' while trying to connect to the WiFi on board.

The aircraft bound for London turned back to the gate after a flight attendant was shown the list of hotspots while taxiing.

Passengers were then forced to get off of the plane with some having to stay in hotels overnight while waiting for the next available flight.

Security concern: American Airlines flight AA136 from LAX to London was delayed for 17 hours after a passenger told a flight attendant a WiFi connection called 'Al-Quida Free Terror Nettwork' was available 

The flight was supposed to take off at 8pm on Sunday night but was rescheduled to take off at 1pm today.

According to ABC 7, the airline is assessing the situation and law enforcement has been notified.

Kevin Simon, who lives in Orange County but is from the UK, told Mail Online that the plane was stationary for one-and-a-half hours before they returned to the gate.

Passengers were told that there was a 'minor security issue' that had to be dealt with, but the pilot and crew never fully explained what was going on.

He added: 'Never once did the pilot mention what the exact problem was. I only found out about the WiFi hotspot name after I got back home and googled for any clues.

'There were a few airport police on the jetway by the door as we deplaned. When I went past them, they didn't appear to have arrested anyone.

'While at the baggage carousel a few passengers were talking, and a lady who had been near the front said that she was sitting near the air marshalls, and when the event happened, both of them jumped up and got busy, with one of them stationing himself in front of the cockpit door.

Anthony Simon, head of Head of Digital at the UK Government Communication service who was on the flight posted on Twitter: 'Thanks to the idiot who did this meaning I won't get back to London for another day 

Another frustrated customer contacted the airline on social media to complain that he had lost money as a result of the delay.

'Abundance of caution': The plane was forced to return back to the gate, forcing passengers off the plane with some having to stay in hotels overnight (file picture)

They replied saying: 'We're sorry for the inconvenience. A customer reported a concern. We’re delaying the flight out of an abundance of caution.' 

When contacted by Mail Online, a spokesman for American Airlines confirmed that the plane returned to the gate after a passenger expressed 'security concerns' and that the flight had been rescheduled. 

In-flight WiFi is now accessible on around 40 per cent of US flights and on a number of international long haul carriers.

Setting up a connection like this can be done through 'tethering'. This is a setting that turns your device into a WiFi hotspot, allowing others to use your internet or data.
