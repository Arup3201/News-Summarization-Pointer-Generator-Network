An arm wrestling game is the first gaming app announced for the Apple Watch (pictured) that was unveiled last night and will go on sale in Spring

With its cutting-edge design, sapphire glass screen and array of functions, you may imagine that the first game to appear on the Apple Watch would be futuristic.

But it is in fact an arm wrestling game designed by a small indie games developer in Fullerton, California.

The title is called iArm Wrestle Champs and is made for the Apple Watch as well as rival Android wearables.

The game will enable the wearer of the Apple Watch to arm wrestle another person, while the app provides commentary, Kotaku reported.

The' accelerometer' in the watch enables it to detect tilting and ultimately who will win the arm wrestling battle.

Players will be able to customise their watch with a picture for the game, record voice clips and more.

A version for iOS and Android smartphones is already available.

As the Apple Watch will go on sale in spring 2015, it seems likely that a variety of games will be developed in time for the launch, to give gamers an alternative to arm wrestling.

It is likely that such games will rely on a user rotating the 'crown' button the side of the device, shouting voice commands or even controlling their heartbeat, instead of trying to tap items on the watch's small screen. 

Apple unveiled its rectangular Apple Watch last night along with two iPhone 6 handsets and a new mobile payment system called Apple Pay.

Numerous features were demonstrated on the new wearable, but there was no mention of gaming at the launch, other than that app developers would be able to create apps for the device.

The watch features a rectangular bezel, rectangular sapphire crystal screen, and curved edges and is made of metal.

At the event, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said: 'Apple Watch is the most personal device we've ever created.'

Ernest Doku, tech expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'All eyes have been on Apple's entry to the smart watch market, and sure enough they've brought their design chops and new hires to bring a truly attractive device to the table. 

It's about time: As the Apple Watch will go on sale in spring 2015, it seems likely that a variety of games will be developed in time for the launch, to give gamers an alternative to arm wrestling. The watch was unveiled in different sizes and styles (pictured) and features a completely new user interface and 'crown' control

As the Apple Watch will go on sale in spring 2015, it seems likely that a variety of games will be developed in time for the launch, to give gamers an alternative to arm wrestling.

It is likely that such games will rely on a user rotating the 'crown' button the side of the device, shouting voice commands or even controlling their heartbeat, instead of trying to tap items on the watch's small screen.

'A bit like Apple’s phones and tablets, the watch has an elegance and luxuriousness which has eluded the efforts of other manufacturers.

'Apple seems to have understood that, like jewellery, watches are highly personal. A choice of sizes, finishes and straps will no doubt convince people that a smart watch is worth investing in.

'However, the fact that users will also need an iPhone with their watch, and it's therefore not a standalone gadget, was glossed over fairly rapidly.'

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll through a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

The watch works with the iPhone 5C, 5S as well as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and it lets users dictate messages via a microphone on the device.

The Apple Watch comes in three finishes - Apple Watch, which comes in silver, the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch Edition, which will be available in 18-karat gold.

Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches.

The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji.

Siri also is built into the Apple Watch.
