The girl of seven left for dead in the French Alps massacre has been brought out of her coma.

Police and social workers will face the agonising task of informing Zainab Al-Hilli that her parents and grandmother were murdered during last Wednesday’s bloodbath in the mountains.

Zainab is still under sedation but when she wakes, her younger sister Zeena, four, will not be there to see her because she returned to Britain yesterday in the care of two relatives.

Recovery: Zainab Al-Hilli, 7, whose parents and grandmother were murdered in their car during last Wednesday’s bloodbath in the mountains, has been brought out of her coma

Peace shattered: The scene of the shooting near Annecy in south-eastern France on Sunday. Detectives are now hunting for clues both at the secluded crime scene and in the UK

Prosecutors confirmed that Zainab, who was shot in the shoulder and savagely beaten around the head, has been brought out of her medically induced coma but it could be a ‘long time’ until she is ready to be spoken to by police.

She remains the key witness to the carnage in which her father Saad Al-Hilli, 50, her mother Ikbal, 47, a dentist, and her grandmother Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, were killed at a remote beauty spot near Lake Annecy.

Each was shot twice in the head in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire thought to have lasted around 30 seconds.

Last night Zainab was under police guard in Grenoble Hospital, separated from Zeena, the one person she now knows, trusts and loves best in the world.

Zeena was reunited with an aunt and uncle, believed to be from her mother’s side of the family, on Saturday at a secret location in the presence of an investigator.

The unnamed couple, who had arrived in France the night before, then accompanied her on the journey home.

French prosecutor Eric Maillaud said 
her journey was carried out under conditions of ‘utmost secrecy’ for 
‘security and safety reasons’.

Zeena’s poignant return came as it was
revealed that she escaped  uninjured after hiding behind her mother’s 
skirt in the family’s BMW, where she was found by police eight hours 
after they were called to the massacre scene.

She has spoken to two women gendarmes,
both trained psychologists specialising in work with children, in a 
room furnished in bright colours and small chairs and tables to make her
feel as comfortable as possible.

Because of where she was hiding, she 
did not see anything important and police say she has given them all the
information she is capable of.

A police source said: ‘Officers only intended to speak to Zeena once about what she witnessed. They do not want her to go through the ordeal of having to relive the trauma of seeing her mother and father being killed again. She returned to London to be with other members of her family who will best be able to care for her needs.

‘It was felt that taking her back to more familiar surroundings is the best way forward for her to recover after probably being psychologically scarred by the terrible experience.’

The same two women officers, who work with a translator, are waiting to be given the go-ahead from medics to interview Zainab in the same way.

Mr Maillaud said: ‘Zeena is still a very young girl, speaking in a childlike way. Zainab might have a lot more information. We hope she can tell us what she saw, give descriptions, the number of people, men or women, skin colours, clothing. Anything that may allow some identification.

‘We simply do not know until she awakes. But that is a medical decision which has to take priority over our investigation. It is up to the doctors, and it could be a long time before she is ready.’

The inquiry into the murder of Saad Al-Hilli will now switch to Surrey

map-making satellites, such as this one, police have discovered that the engineer was working on a secret contract for one of Europe's biggest defence companies

Zeena and a British cyclist who came 
upon the massacre first and called police are the only people who have 
been able to give investigators clues about the identity of the 
attackers.

Senior law enforcement sources say a contract killer would charge a minimum of £50,000 to carry out such a high-profile crime.

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 
father of three, was also shot dead after apparently disturbing the 
killing spree on Wednesday afternoon.

Balsam Hilli-Xanthis, 59, a cousin of
Iraq-born Mr Al-Hilli, has offered to help the orphaned children 
financially. A family source said: ‘Balsam called Surrey Police. She is 
in Iraq at the moment. She has made no official request for custody, she
was offering to help, most likely in a financial way.’
