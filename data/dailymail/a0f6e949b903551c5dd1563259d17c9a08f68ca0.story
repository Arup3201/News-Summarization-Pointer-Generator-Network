A mom from Texas learned the hard way that taking a nap with her baby doesn't allow her any shut eye. However, she does get poked in the eye and experiences gassier disturbances.

While cherubic looking, Esther Anderson's baby girl doesn't like it when mommy falls asleep and does everything in her power to ensure her mother stays awake.

Anderson posted a video on YouTube of the humorous anti-naps and cleverly titled it 'Why Co-Sleeping is No-Sleeping.' Since being posted on December 2 the video already has over 800,000 views. 

Peaceful: At first glance it may look like Esther Anderson and her baby are sleeping peacefully 

Baby nose mommy: This baby doesn't want mommy to sleep so she tries picking mommy's nose to wake her

No shut eye: Baby tries poking mommy's eyes so that she wakes up to play with her 

'Every morning I ask myself why I didn't just put [my baby] back in her crib,' Anderson wrote in a YouTube caption.

'I think I'm not alone in this.'

The baby tries numerous tactics such as picking her mother’s nose, smacking her in the chin, and poking her in the eye.

When a simple jab doesn't rouse her mother she attempts to wake her by laying directly on top of her face with the full weight of her little body.

Anderson who wants to stay asleep tries giving her baby some mascara to play with so she get grab a few more minutes of shut eye.

Too smart for her own good, the baby decides to use her mother's mascara as waking prod and she hits her mother in the face with it.

The baby's champion move however is lying on top of her mother and breaking wind directly in her face.
