A kangaroo with a love for pictures has surprised a trio of British tourists by demanding a selfie.

Brendan Cleaves and two of his friends were visiting Australia Zoo in Brisbane when they met a particularly curious character. 

'This one guy seemed pretty curious with us and our English banter,' Mr Cleaves said.

British tourist, Brendan Cleaves, and two of his friends snapped the perfect selfie with a kangaroo at Australia Zoo in Brisbane 

'We took the usually tourist pics but he just followed us about, as if the normal pictures weren't cutting it for him. 

'We all knew what he was trying to get at, so we all huddled around and got an awesome selfie pic.'

Avoiding the overused duck-face pout, the roo and his new friends opted for the humour inducing mouth-half-open pose.

But rather than growing disinterested and hopping away, the kangaroo proved hard to please.

That’s one happy quokka: Roo’s aren't the only Australian animal that love a photo

'Admittedly it did take a few goes, but he was a perfectionist and wanted to get the frame right,' Mr Cleaves said.

However, it seems the overly friendly roo isn't the only Australian animal that loves having a photo snapped of itself, as some other social media users found out.

Gavin Tan from Victoria, for instance, found out that cockatoos are all about the perfect pose, not just some free feed.
