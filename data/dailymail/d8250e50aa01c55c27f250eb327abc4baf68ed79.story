You use them to wash your knives, forks and plates, but experts have warned that dishcloths are dirtier than toilet handles.

The cloths collect six times as much bacteria as the handles and harbour potentially life-threatening germs such as E.coli, according to a new study.

Research has revealed that Britain’s dishcloths are the dirtiest in the world and health specialists have warned they could be responsible for spreading infections in the home.

Experts have warned that dishcloths harbour six times as much bacteria as toilet flush handles and and six out of 10 have germs such as E.coli, according to a new study

Dishcloths from homes in the UK, U.S. South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and India were swabbed and analysed in an international laboratory to identify the type and levels of bacteria present.

The Dettol hygiene home truths study, which was commissioned by the UK-based Global Hygiene Council, found that nine out of 10 dishcloths were ‘heavily contaminated’ with bacteria, while 10 per cent were ‘unsatisfactory'.

A total of seven per cent of dishcloths had more than one billion bacteria per square metre and 60 per cent were contaminated with E.coli, which causes stomach upsets and can be fatal.

A quarter of the cloths contained one 
billion Pseudomonas spp. per square metre, which is an organism linked 
to damp and dirty conditions. The bacteria can cause minor skin and eye infections and potentially life‐threatening illness.

All
 the British cloths swabbed failed the overall microbiological hygiene 
tests and the U.S. also failed 100 per cent of the laboratory tests.

The study suggests that Britain’s 
dishcloths are dirtier than people’s toilet flushes with 20 per cent of handles having ‘unsatisfactory or worse’ levels of 
bacteria, compared to 100 per cent of dishcloths.

Just five per cent of the cloths collected in India, 10 per cent in the UAE and 25 per cent of cloths collected in South Africa were found to have ‘satisfactory’ levels of bacteria.

Health experts warn that unhygienic dishcloths could be responsible for spreading germs around the home.

‘Dishcloths are a hidden health hazard in people’s homes as they harbour harmful bacteria and can spread them around the kitchen - over worktops, chopping boards, on surfaces families eat at and potentially throughout the home', said Professor John Oxford, Professor of Virology St Barts and the Royal London Queen Mary College.

‘By using a contaminated cloth, people are likely to be transferring bacteria around the home and putting themselves and their families at risk of infection.

'A dirty dishcloth can also contaminate hands, which in turn can cause direct contamination of other surfaces and cause indirect infection.’

While 40 per cent of people recognise that dishcloths can harbour high levels of bacteria, just 15 per cent regularly machine wash them at high enough temperatures to kill the germs.
