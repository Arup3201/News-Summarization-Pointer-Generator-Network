A teenage soap star who was moonlighting as a £50-an-hour prostitute has been sacked from her TV job after revelations of her sordid secret life came to light.

Czech celebrity Diana Korbelova, 18, is known to millions of viewers as student Maria in the popular Czech soap The Street.

But when not filming, Diana took on the persona of a teenage temptress called Ester and worked as a prostitute in the leafy district of Vinohrady in the Czech capital Prague.

Based in a rented apartment, the  brunette charged £28  for half an hour and £56 for a full hour.

But she was exposed when punters started bragging about meeting her on social media.

One client, aged 54, said: 'She told me she had worked there for over two months and she liked sex.

'She said she got more customers than the girls who had worked there much longer than she had, and that they were all jealous of her.

'She'd gone from The Street to a brothel and loved it.'
