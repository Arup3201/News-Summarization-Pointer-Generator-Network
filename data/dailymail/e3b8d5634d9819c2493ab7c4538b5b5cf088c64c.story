House Republicans on Thursday rammed through a measure opening a new investigation of the deadly assault in Benghazi, Libya, vowing to dig deeper in a search for truth. Democrats declared it merely a political ploy to raise campaign cash and motivate voters.

A bitterly divided House voted 232-186 to establish the panel that Speaker John Boehner insisted would answer questions that linger almost 20 months after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission. Seven Democrats, many facing tough re-election campaigns, broke ranks and joined Republicans in supporting the probe.

The panel's investigation will be the eighth on Benghazi and will examine the entirety of the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.  Independent, bipartisan and GOP-led probes have faulted the State Department for inadequate security at the outpost, leading to four demotions. No attacker has yet been brought to justice.

Speaker of the House John Boehner is asked about the special select committee he has formed to investigate the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Thursday

Republicans say they're unsatisfied with explanations so far, and they have leveled a range of accusations against President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other senior administration officials. Chief among them: that the administration misled the American people about the nature of the attack during a presidential election campaign and stonewalled congressional investigators.

'We will not take any shortcuts to the truth, accountability or justice,' Boehner said during House debate.

Democrats remain divided over whether to boycott the select committee. They are concerned that their participation would grant legitimacy to what they believe will be a partisan forum. But they also worry that if they avoid it they won't have the chance to counter GOP claims and defend potential witnesses â€” including Clinton, a possible 2016 presidential candidate.

Party leaders will meet with their rank and file Friday morning to decide on the next step.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., leaves a closed-door Republican strategy meeting at the Capitol in Washington on Wednesday. Speaker of the House John Boehner has tapped Gowdy to chair a special select committee to investigate the attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya

Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of
 Florida criticized the 'song and dance' she said came from Clinton when
 House members wanted to question her about Benghazi a few months after 
the attack. Clinton's testimony before the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee was delayed when she missed a month of work toward the end of 
her tenure after suffering a virus, then a fall and a concussion, and 
then brief hospitalization for a blood clot near her brain.

Rep.
 Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said no evidence uncovered in any of the 
investigations thus far suggests wrongdoing by the administration. 
Republican claims have descended into 'the crass and unbelievable,' she 
said.

Rep. Adam Schiff, 
D-Calif., said the questions 'have been asked and answered time and time
 and time again,' and he added: 'Let's end the political circus.'

Benghazi
 has produced 13 public hearings, the release of 25,000 pages of 
documents and 50 separate briefings. The select committee won't be the 
only inquiry, as other GOP-led congressional panels continue their 
probes, including a House Oversight investigation which just last week 
took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing a Cabinet member. Secretary 
of State John Kerry hasn't said when he might testify.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., followed by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., leaves a closed-door Republican strategy meeting in Washington on Wednesday

Democrats
 deride the effort as a conservative campaign designed to energize 
Republican voters in typically low-turnout midterm elections.

Boehner's
 legislation creates a select House committee through the end of the 
year. It will have to be reapproved when a new Congress begins in 
January or go out of existence. The select committee has no explicit 
financial constraints.

The 
Obama administration says officials tried to provide the public with the
 best information available after the attack at a time when U.S. 
embassies, consulates and other facilities were facing angry 
demonstrations across the Muslim world over a YouTube video mocking 
Islam's Prophet Muhammad. The administration originally attributed 
Benghazi to a similar protest that extremists hijacked, but retracted 
that account amid severe criticism.

House
 Democrats have issued several demands if they are to participate in the
 select committee. Boehner already has rejected their call for equal 
representation on the panel, deciding instead to fill it with seven 
Republicans and five Democrats. The Democrats also seek guarantees 
they'll have equal access to documents, say on subpoenas and right to 
question witnesses. Negotiations continue.
