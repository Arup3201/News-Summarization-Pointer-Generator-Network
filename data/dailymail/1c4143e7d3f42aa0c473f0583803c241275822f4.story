Anderson Cooper was forced to explain to a reporter in Ottawa Wednesday why he would not take a selfie next to the scene where a soldier was shot dead.

Sun News contributor, 26-year-old Vandon Gene, pestered the veteran CNN anchor for a picture as he took a break in live coverage at the National War Memorial in Canada's capital city.

Cooper was in Ottawa covering the tragic shooting of a reservist and single father, 24-year-old Corporal Nathan Cirillo, who was shot dead by a gunman.

Anderson Cooper was forced to explain to a young local reporter in Ottawa why it was 'wildly inappropriate' to take a selfie photo next to the National War Memorial where a solider was shot dead

When Gene pressed Cooper for the selfie, the CNN anchor refused and added: 'Have a little respect for what happened here today.' 

When the reporter asked yet again, Cooper said: 'No, I will not take a photo with you on a day where someone was killed. It seems wildly inappropriate.'

Instead of retreating in shame, Gene followed up by posting a video of his exchange with Cooper on YouTube, adding a series of self-pitying messages. 

The Canadian tweeted: 'Anderson Cooper exploits Ottawa shooting by flying to Ottawa, but has decency to criticize me for asking for a photo?'

Gene also wrote: 'So @anderson cooper is an a**. Told me to give him ''a f****** break'' then went on a rant.' 

Cooper was quick to respond, tweeting back at Gene: 'Dude, you were rude and asking for a selfie near where a soldier was killed. It was completely inappropriate. Think about it.

'I can’t believe any station employs you, and if you want to be a journalist, learn how to behave when covering a story.' 

Venting: Gene posted a video of his angry exchange with Cooper, whom he called an 'a**,' on Twitter 

Furious: The Canadian accused his American counterpart of coming to Ottawa to exploit the tragedy  

From bad to worse: The 26-year-old continued ranting on social media, insisting that he was not seeking a 'selfie' with the famed journalist 

Pushback: Cooper put the rookie reporter in his place while offering him some career advice 

Spelling it out: Cooper explained to Gene via Twitter where exactly he's gone wrong 

Sun News appeared to have terminated Gene's employment today.

Matt Wolf, an executive producer at Sun News, apologized for Gene’s actions in a tweet Wednesday night. He later followed up saying that the reporter 'no longer has any association' with the news outlet, according to National Post.  

Gene then apologized himself, writing: 'I unreservedly apologize for my actions yesterday. It was completely inappropriate, disrepectful [sic], and distasteful.'

The budding journalist, who describes himself as a 'news junkie,' appeared to have edited his tweets to remove the exchange with Cooper  Wednesday.

Gene also hosts an online show on the Tea Party News Network and attends Carleton University in Ottawa. 

Damage control: Gene later walked back his remarks, apologizing for his inappropriate behavior 

Mia culpa: The beleaguered reporter expressed his contrition a second time 

Show of remorse: To prove that he was taking what happened in Ottawa seriously, Gene posted a message eulogizing the slain soldier 

Gene 'unreservedly' and repeatedly apologized again in a tweet Thursday morning.

'It was completely inappropriate, disrespectful, and distasteful,' he wrote.

Gene reportedly edited his Twitter bio after the incident to remove any reference to the network, but his LinkedIn portfolio still lists him as a contributor to Sun News.  

On his personal website, Gene describes himself as someone who 'believes in fair and balanced journalism.'

'[He] searches for the facts, no matter where they may lie. He asks the tough questions, digs deeper into the story, and follows it through to the end to get his viewers the answers.'
