The Malaysian chairman of Laura Ashley is facing a huge divorce payout after his estranged wife won the right to have the case heard in English courts.

Pauline Chai, 67, a former beauty queen, is expected to demand that Khoo Kay Peng hand over half of his riches after their 43-year marriage fell apart last year.

If that happens, it could become one of Britain's largest ever divorce payments. Boris Berezovsky is thought to have paid the most, after reportedly handing £220million to  Galina Besharova in 2011.

During her case, Ms Chai claimed her husband made her feel like a prisoner on their 1,000-acre country estate, Rosway Park, only allowed her £100 per week for food.

In an attempt to prove Britain is her permanent home, Miss Chai told the court she has 1,000 pairs of shoes in her sprawling £30million Hertfordshire mansion.

Pauline Chai, 67, is expected to demand half of her husband's estimated £440million fortune after she today won the right to have her divorce proceedings thrashed out in UK courts

She also told the judge that her husband is worth around £440million, though Dr Peng's lawyers dispute this, saying they do not know the value of his assets.

In his ruling today, Mr Justice Bodey said he struggled to believe Ms Chai's statement about her footwear collection, but noted that she spent 54 per cent of her time in this country last year.

Though he found in Ms Chai's favour, he urged the couple to come to an out-of-court settlement, saying the pair had so much money they would be ‘hard pressed to spend it all in their lifetimes’.

Dr Peng had been pushing to have the divorce heard in Malaysia, where his wife would be entitled to far less of his wealth.

He accused Ms Chai of ‘passport juggling’ and being a ‘forum shopper’ - planning to leave England as soon as the divorce is concluded.

Dr Peng has already spent nearly three quarters of a million fighting the case, and said he may still proceed with a case in Malaysia - a move described by Mr Justice Bodey as ‘a nightmare’.

The judge said he could not be sure of the extent of Dr Peng’s wealth, since he had ‘declined at this stage’ to reveal his assets.

He went on to comment that although Malaysia could be an appropriate country for the divorce, ‘England may also be appropriate’.

‘There are many features linking the case to this jurisdiction, just as there are many linking it to Malaysia’, the judge said. 

He said Rosway Park was ‘a home’ for the family but only ‘one of their homes’. He agreed that the property is not a commercial venture, ‘as the husband has sought to make out’.

In his lengthy judgment, Mr Justice Bodey went on to calculate that Miss Chai had spent twice as much time in England compared with Malaysia in recent years.

This, he concluded, was a ‘fair amount’ and was enough to establish Ms Chai’s residence.

‘I am satisfied as I can be in an uncertain world that the wife does intend to remain here with a regular immigration status, as soon as she has the necessary funding, which I am told is £1million, to achieve this.

Of Ms Chai’s shoes, he said, ‘I have asked myself whether the wife was lying when she spoke of 1,000 pairs of shoes. It is an awful lot of shoes and would take up an awful lot of space’.

The judge did not accuse her of making up the figure, but said there must be ‘an element of hyperbole’ in it.

But he added Dr Peng had been ‘evasive’ and ‘less than helpful’ when appeared on video-link from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.

‘I have carefully reflected on the wife’s own evidence and her demeanour and I reminded myself that her words to me and her words to other are inevitably self-serving.’

But he concluded, ‘In the end, I have concluded on the balance of probabilities that the wife has made out her case.’

Dr Peng has previously said press reports of his wealth were ‘totally false’ and put about by his estranged wife.

He asked: ‘One thousand pairs of shoes? How are you going to wear 1,000 pairs of shoes? I don’t know what she buys, because she loves shopping.

‘She shops all over the place. The last time I read of 1,000 pairs of shoes... do you remember Imelda Marcos?’

Mr Justice Bodey ruled that England is the appropriate jurisdiction for in the upcoming divorce. He also rejected Dr Peng’s application for a stay in the English proceedings. 

Costs will be finalised at a later date. Dr Peng’s barrister has asked for permission to appeal.

After the ruling, Pauline Chai stated: 'I wish to thank the Judge, Mr Justice Bodey, for his astute and meticulously detailed findings. 

'I also wish to thank my excellent legal team, Messrs Vardags, Richard Todd QC, Nicholas Yates and Tom Harvey of counsel. I hold the English justice system in the highest regard and greatest esteem.

'I have always had a great love of all things English. I am proud to be associated with the exquisite British brand Laura Ashley. 

'I am proud to be one of the beneficiaries of one of the greatest gifts that the English have given to the world; the Rule of Law.

'This case confirms that English justice is not only alive but thriving. The people of England are unknowingly very fortunate indeed to have a legal system which is so utterly sound. 

'I am pleased the Judge recognised my connection with this great country. I am so pleased that that I, my children and my shoes have found a home here.'

Dr Khoo, chairman of Malaysian United Industries, has properties in England, Kuala Lumpur and Australia.

He has a 40 per cent stake in Laura Ashley,  and is director of Corus Hotels Limited which owns ten hotels including the grand Corus Hyde Park Hotel.

The couple, who married in 1970 and have five grown-up children, and bought their estate in Hertfordshire in 1998 which is said to include a menagerie of animals and two custom-built lakes costing £60,000 each. 

Ayesha Vardag, Solicitor for Pauline Chai, said : 'Mr Justice Bodey has made a very just decision. 

'Pauline Chai trusted in the laws of England, where she made a real and long-term home for herself and her children, and they did not fail her.'
