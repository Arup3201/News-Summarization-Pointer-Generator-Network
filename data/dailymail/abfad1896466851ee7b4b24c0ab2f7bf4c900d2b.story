Every two days a £50,000 bill for the gallons of diesel poured into Sports Direct’s fleet of Scania trucks arrives at their enormous distribution centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.

When HR have finished sifting through the 26 applications for driver jobs on £12 an hour as part of the company’s ‘expanding night delivery team’, it will rise again.

This is Mike Ashley’s empire, in which staff with no set hours are employed only when there is enough work, often doing shifts through the night on a sprawling site where the warehouses are nearly a kilometre long.

Expansion is planned for Ashley's empire, Sports Direct - revenue has grown by over £1billion since 2009

NEWCASTLE v LEICESTER

Kick-off: Saturday, 3pm at St James’ Park.

Alan Pardew will be hoping for some respite from his problems when Newcastle face Leicester. And the omens look good: Newcastle are undefeated in their last eight league games against Leicester, winning four and drawing four.

There are further expansion plans at Sports Direct. Revenue has grown from 1.367billion in 2009 to £2.7bn in April 2014, as they gain a foothold in Europe. They boast more than 665 stores.

Ashley employs around 28,000 people, but the focus will be on one member of staff when Newcastle United face Leicester City at St James’ Park.

Newcastle’s owner has told friends that defeat by Nigel Pearson’s team, sitting 12th in the Barclays Premier League, is unthinkable. It could even spell the end for Alan Pardew.

Ashley has a solid relationship with Newcastle’s manager, but the following three fixtures against Tottenham (league), Manchester City (Capital One Cup) and Liverpool (league) represent a formidable challenge.

On Saturday, when the Premier League resumes after the international window, Ashley will fly up to Tyneside in his helicopter in time to greet Leicester’s guests.

Ashley is amiable and affable, erring on the side of caution when he discusses the game before kick-off and always wishing visiting directors good luck.

In the Newcastle boardroom, which is finished in black and white lacquered trims, Leicester’s directors will be greeted by the sight of the shirts of all 20 Premier League clubs hanging in huge picture frames.

With Ashley’s team failing to win at home since May 3, there is a danger the colours of Huddersfield, Brighton and Rotherham will replace them in the boardroom suite next season.

Keeping this team in the top flight is Pardew’s job for the time being, but he is battling to keep it after failing to win any of Newcastle’s opening seven games.

The two-week international break gave him respite, as did the 2-2 draw at Swansea on October 4, but Pardew was urged to use the time wisely and re-align the team before the visit of Leicester.

Ashley rarely visits the training ground, although it is not unheard of for his helicopter to touch down in the grounds of Darsley Park for an impromptu review of the club.

He turned up in March unannounced, just after Newcastle had been trounced 3-0 by Everton at St James’ Park, but his presence had little impact; they lost their following game 4-0 at Southampton and by the same margin at Manchester United.

Pardew has failed to arrest the decline, despite a number of arrivals at the club over the summer. They are yet to gel.

There is also the mystery of why three high-profile signings - Sylvain Marveaux from Rennes, Hatem Ben Arfa from Marseille and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa from Montpellier, have made no impact. All of them are out on loan.

Understandably, in recent weeks Pardew has become increasingly introspective. 

Hatem Ben Arfa and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa - on loan at Hull and Roma respectively - were both high-profile buys

Aug 17 - Man City (H) 0-2

Aug 23 - Aston Villa (A) 0-0

Aug 30 - Crystal Palace (H) 3-3

Sep 13 - Southampton (A) 0-4

Sep 20 - Hull (H) 2-2

Sep 29 - Stoke (A) 0-1

Oct    4 - Swansea (A) 2-2

Outside of his core coaching staff, including former Crystal Palace team-mate Andy Woodman and assistant manager John Carver, he no longer knows who to trust. 

Ashley has been supportive, speaking to his manager several times as they attempt to halt a catastrophic run of results.

He has been reluctant to panic and fire the manager, particularly when there is a £5m compensation clause in the eight-year contract Pardew signed in September 2012.

In terms of day-to-day operations at the club, Ashley misses the influence of former managing director Derek Llambias. The pair fell out over the direction of the club in June 2013, leading to Llambias’s resignation.

They still talk and remain friends, but try to avoid the topic of football when they do.

Ashley promoted Lee Charnley, who was previously football secretary, to take Llambias’s place as managing director in April.

At the same time, Ashley formally appointed himself to the board at Newcastle, even though no-one has ever been in doubt about who is in charge.

Despite Ashley’s southern roots (he was born and raised in the Buckinghamshire town of Burnham), he developed an affection with the North East after he bought the club in May 2007. Contrary to popular belief he admires the locals’ work ethic and is upset Newcastle supporters have mounted demonstrations against his leadership at various times over the years.

Ashley, who grew up in a modest house, has paid off the club’s significant debts that were inherited from the previous regime.

Today he is owed £130m by Newcastle.

That can wait, but it will take more than a tank of diesel to put things right at St James’ Park. Right now, Newcastle are running on empty.
