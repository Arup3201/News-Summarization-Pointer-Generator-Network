Jeremy Smith, 45, was convicted of raping a woman at a swinger's club Halloween party following a nine-day trial at Sheffield Crown Court

A cabaret performer is facing jail after he was found guilty of raping a woman at a swingers' club while dressed as Herman Munster.

Jeremy Smith, 45, was part of male cabaret team performing at a Halloween party at La Chambre in Attercliffe, Sheffield, when he attacked the woman in a room of mirrors.

He was found guilty following a nine-day trial at Sheffield Crown Court and will be sentenced in September. 

The married father was dressed as the character from The Munsters while his two friends were dressed as Harry Potter and Herman’s wife in drag.

The 22-year-old victim, who was at the club with two friends, said she only went to the club to socialise and never indulged in sexual activities.

Charlotte Baines, prosecuting, said the victim and her friends had been plied with wine by the cabaret performers before they went to watch other people have sex in the upstairs playrooms.

She later became separated from her friends when Smith persuaded her to go into a mirrored smoking room.

He began to kiss and grope her before he pulled down her underwear, according to the prosecution.

As he undid his trousers the woman 'froze' and he lifted her onto his lap and had sex with her as she tried to move him away.

The woman told the court: 'My body just went into shock. I was just completely frozen. I was really rigid and tense.'

She went on: 'Just because of where it was it doesn’t mean that gave him the right to do that to me.

'I didn’t give him any indication I wanted to have sex with him that night. He shouldn’t get away with what he’s done.'

She told the police as she was being raped she thought: 'He was really, really tall and big in his platform soles. I thought My God where are my friends.'

She locked herself in a toilet and complained to management and Smith was later arrested.Smith claimed any sexual activity was consensual. He said the woman had been flirting with him and they were getting on well.

Venue: The married father was performing alongside two other men dressed as Harry Potter in La Chambre, Sheffield, when he attacked the woman who was in fancy dress

Attack: The victim told the court that Smith started kissing her before pulling down her underwear to her embarrassment 

He also claimed that she had been happy to go upstairs to watch other people have sex and is said to have engaged in a sex act with another unknown man.

He claimed she willingly went to the smoking room and had consensual sex. He kept her underwear to save her embarrassment when her friends came back and interrupted them.

Smith, formerly of Tingley, Wakefield who now lives in Regent Street, London had denied rape.

Judge Peter Kelson adjourned the case for reports and told Smith to sort out his affairs before he is sentenced.
