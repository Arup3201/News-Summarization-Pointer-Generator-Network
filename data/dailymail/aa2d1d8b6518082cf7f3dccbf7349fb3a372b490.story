Republicans condemned President Obama's announcement that remaining U.S. troops will withdraw from Iraq by the end of the year.

Senator John McCain said the President's decision is a 'harmful' setback for U.S. interests in the Middle East.

Senator McCain said: 'I respectfully disagree with the President. This decision will be viewed as a strategic victory for our enemies in the Middle East, especially the Iranian regime, which has worked relentlessly to ensure a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.'

Several candidates hoping to be picked for the Republican presidential nomination also offered their opinions.

Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney said: 'President Obama's astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in Iraq has unnecessarily put at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of American men and women.'

Herman Cain said: 'Whether or not itâ€™s the right thing to do, I would consult with the commanders.

'The thing I wouldn't do that the president is doing is telling the enemy how many troops you're going to bring out and when you are going to bring them out. I don't think that's a good strategy.'

Democrats largely praised the decision as a promise Obama has kept from his pledges made while campaigning for the presidency.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the move honours 'the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement and the wishes of the American people to bring all our troops home by the end this year'.

President Barack Obama made the announcement marking the end of one of the longest and most divisive conflicts in U.S. history.

'As promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America's war in Iraq will be over,' the President said. 'The tide of war is receding.'

'The U.S. is moving forward from a position of strength,' he added.

Around 4,000 to 5,000 security contractors will remain in Iraq, the White House said.

End of war: The announcement marks a major milestone after nine years of war

Obama's
statement put an end to months of wrangling over whether the U.S. would
maintain a force in Iraq beyond 2011. The President spoke following a 
video conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the White 
House said in a statement.

Mr Obama said the announcement marked a 'move into a new phase.'

He vowed to work with the Iraqi government and said the two countries were 'in full agreement about how to move forward'.

'As of January 1 it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations,' he said.

'This will be a strong and enduring partnership... that will unleash the potential of the Iraqi people.'

But
immediately following the announcement there were claims that the 
troops were bring withdrawn because the Iraqi government had refused to 
let them stay.

The National
Journal reported that as recently as last week, the White House was 
trying to persuade the Iraqis to allow between 2,000 and 3,000 stay 
beyond the end of the year.

Only about 150 soldiers will be stationed in Iraq from next year who will protect the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and assist in arms sales.

'We can say troops will definitely be home for the holidays,' Mr Obama said.

Obama, an opponent of the war from the start, took office and accelerated the end of the conflict. In August 2010, he declared the U.S. combat mission over.

'Over the next two months our troops in Iraq, tens of thousands of them, will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home,' Obama said.

'The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their heads held high, proud of their success and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops.'

Mr Obama said that he wanted to 'join Americans in paying tribute to those who have served... and given their lives.'

The withdrawal of American troops 
marks a major milestone in the war that started in 2003 and resulted in 
the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.

The two countries have been 
negotiating over whether the United States would leave behind up to 
several thousand military trainers after year-end, or if all remaining 
troops would depart as planned by December 31. The main sticking point 
has been legal immunity for any U.S. forces that remain.

After ending combat operations in 
2010, the last 44,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to leave Iraq by the end
of the year under the terms of a bilateral security pact.

In recent months, Washington had been
discussing with Iraqi leaders the possibility of several thousand 
American troops remaining to continue training Iraqi security forces.

Throughout the discussions, Iraqi 
leaders refused to give U.S. troops immunity from prosecution in Iraqi 
courts, and the Americans refused to stay without that guarantee.

Moreover, Iraq's leadership has been split on whether it wanted American forces to stay.

When the 2008 agreement requiring all
U.S. forces to leave Iraq was passed, many U.S. officials assumed it 
would inevitably be renegotiated so that Americans could stay longer.

The U.S. said repeatedly this year it
would entertain an offer from the Iraqis to have a small force stay 
behind, and the Iraqis said they would like American military help. But 
as the year wore on and the number of American troops that Washington 
was suggesting could stay behind dropped, it became increasingly clear 
that a U.S. troop presence was not a sure thing.

The issue of legal protection for the Americans was the deal-breaker.

Pulling troops out by the end of this year allows both al-Maliki and Obama to claim victory.

Obama kept a campaign promise to end 
the war, and al-Maliki will have ended the American presence and 
restored Iraqi sovereignty.

The President used the war statement 
to once again turn attention back to the economy, the domestic concern 
that is expected to determine whether he wins re-election next year.

'After a decade of war the nation 
that we need to build and the nation that we will build is our own, an 
America that sees its economic strength restored just as we've restored 
our leadership around the globe.'

More than 4,400 American military members have been killed since the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003.

A senior White House official told NBC News: 'This will allow us to say definitively that the Iraq war is over.'
