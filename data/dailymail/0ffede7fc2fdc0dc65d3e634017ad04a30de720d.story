Forget love and companionship, for one in six men a relationship is dependent on performance between the sheets - and they would leave a partner who failed to satisfy them in bed.

Hitting the spot is so important to one in four men and one in five women that they rate having regular orgasms more highly than being in love.

But despite how important their sex lives are to their relationships, less than half of Britons admitted they were 'very happy' with how often they orgasm in a recent survey conducted by online retailer bondara.co.uk.

It's over: 39 per cent of Brits said failing to reach an orgasm with their partner would be a contributory factor in a break-up

They quizzed 3800 British men and women and found that 16 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women would end a loving relationship if they failed to reach an orgasm with their partner, with a further 39 per cent of men and women stating it would be a contributory factor.

Although 60 per cent said they were 'very happy' when asked to rate their relationship in general, this figure fell by 17 per cent for men and 6 per cent for women when asked to rate the sexual side of their relationship.

When asked what affected their ability to reach orgasm, tiredness was the most common cause 
with 20 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men. Self-esteem 
issues ranked second for women followed by 'lack of sexual 
desire'.

For 15 per cent of men, hitting the booze caused a problem in the
 bedroom as being drunk prevented them from climaxing, while job worries affect 12 per cent of men.

One in four of those surveyed stated they felt under pressure to reach orgasm every time they have sex. As a result 27 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women have at some point faked an orgasm.

Joanna Coker, sex expert for Bondara.co.uk, said couples should try not to get so 'hung up' on achieving an orgasm.

She said: 'While having an orgasm is a wonderful part of sex, making love can still be enjoyable without the big 'O'.

'Try not to get too hung up on it as this will only make the situation worse. The ability to have an orgasm is affected by many factors as this survey shows, to be at your sexual peak keep healthy, try not to get overtired and avoid too much alcohol.'

Ms Coker added that the old adage of 'never going to bed on an argument' is true if you want a fulfilling sex life and couples shouldn't be afraid to talk to one another about issues between the sheets.

'Misunderstandings
 and conflicts can all affect your sexual life; it is hard to feel 
carefree and orgasm when you are conflicted or angry with your partner. 
If you're having difficulties talk about them and try to resolve them, 
leaving you freer to relax and enjoy your sex life,' she said.

Bondara conducted their research to mark next week's 'National Orgasm Day' and asked respondents worked for them in the bedroom.

For 47 per cent of women, spending more time on foreplay made a difference as well as more oral sex (38 per cent) and introducing sex toys (35 per cent).

For men, more oral sex (54 per cent) was a must, followed by spending more time on foreplay (43 per cent), introducing sex toys (42 per cent) and changing sexual positions (38 per cent). 

A separate survey by Ann Summers revealed how the sex lives of Brits varies around the country.

They found that men from the South East, aged between 25-34, who are in a relationship and have sex several times a week, fake an orgasm more regularly than sexually active, male singletons. 

Men from the South East (17 per cent) are also most likely to fake it compared 
to Welsh men (8 per cent) and those who reside in the North East (2 per cent). 

Meanwhile, women who live in Northern Ireland (6 per cent), Yorkshire (6 per cent) and the North 
East (5 per cent) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern 
counterparts, as the survey revealed that women from South East (18 per cent) 
and South West (10 per cent) are the biggest fakers.

Their poll of 500 people found that when it comes to having the most orgasms – single 
men have it the best, with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to 
50 per cent of those in a loving relationship.

In contrast for women, married life equals more orgasms, as only 12 per cent pretend in bed compared to 28 per cent of singletons.
