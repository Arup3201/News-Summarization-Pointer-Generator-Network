Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and midfielder Frank Lampard have been unwittingly drawn into a mafia murder trial.

Pictures of the Special One and Lampard have been used as evidence by lawyers representing alleged mob godfathers Carmine Pagano, Carmine Amato and Rito Calzone.

They claim they could not have been involved in the murder of rival Carmine Amoruso, 44, gunned down in a video arcade as part of a war between rival factions eight years ago because they were at a football match.

The pictures show the three accused, posing with Mourinho and Lampard while the Blues were staying at the luxury Hotel Arts in Barcelona where the team were staying for a Champions League clash.

Others photos show the men alongside then Chelsea stars Hernon Crespo and Nuno Morais - the game ended in a 1-1 draw with Barcelona going through 3-2 on aggregate after beating the Premier League side in London.

A supergrass named the three men as responsible for the murder and they have already been convicted and sentenced to life but are currently appealing.

Lawyers at the hearing in Naples have also produced plane tickets and hotel bills as proof for the trio's alibis and staff from the hotel are also expected to testify.

The three men are members of the Amato-Pagano crime family who have been waging a murderous war against rivals for control of lucrative drug markets in Naples, home to the local mafia known as the Camorra.

One picture shows Calzone, 40, standing next to a smiling Lampard in the corridor of the plush five star hotel Arts where rooms start at £1,000 a night.

Calzone was sentenced to 14 years by a court in Naples in 2010 and the bloody war between the rival gangs has claimed more than 50 lives.

He is also suspected of seven murders and is a committed member of the hard core Napoli Ultras and has been photographed several times at their stadium and police say he was involved in serious fighting with supporters of rivals Roma in 2008.

Amoruso was shot several times in the hit and died in an ambulance as he was being rushed to hospital, while another man he was with, a convicted mobster, suffered serious leg injuries but survived.

The supergrasses have been named as Antonio Parolisi and Andrea Pica and both claim Calzone was at the scene of the murder in a suburb of Naples and had ordered it along with the two other men later saying 'a just thing has been done.'

Police say the trio have made millions from importing cocaine and supplying the city of Naples as well as much of southern Italy and it funded their luxury lifestyle of lavish villas and top of the range cars.

Official say they flew business class to Barcelona on false identity documents and spent more than £15,000 during their three night stay at the hotel Arts.

Luigi Senese, the lawyer defending Cesare Pagano, said:"These photographs are crucial to the case because thy indicate that my client and the other two men could not have been at the scene of the murder.

'You can clearly see Pagano in the pictures with the Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho as well as several team members. How can he and the others have been at the murder and at the game at the same time?

'These super grasses are lying. The three men were in Barcelona for a Champions League match and besides the photographs we have hotel receipts and airline tickets.

'The three men were in Barcelona to watch the match as they are all keen football fans no fortunately for them they bumped into Mourinho and took a photograph with him to prove they were there.'
