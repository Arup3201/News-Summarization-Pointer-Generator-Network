A schoolgirl was slashed and stabbed at home as she apparently tried to stop a knife-wielding intruder from attacking her father.

Ayeshea Collins, 13, was fighting for her life last night after coming to the aid of her DJ father as he was repeatedly stabbed.

As Rob Jackson, 41, desperately tried to defend himself his daughter rushed downstairs to protect him.

But the teenager suffered horrendous injuries herself when the knifeman turned on her.

Murdered: Victim Robert Jackson, 41, (left and right) was stabbed to death at home and it is alleged that his daughter Ayeshea, who is in a critical condition, may have been trying to protect him

Murder: Forensics close off the home of Robert Jackson in Moston, Manchester, where he was killed and his daughter Ayeshea critically injured after a knife attack last night

Probe: Forensics are working in the house and outside to piece together what happened 

Mr Jackson, a part-time DJ and carpet fitter, who was friendly with members of bands the Happy Mondays and Oasis, died after collapsing in a pool of blood.

Ayeshea also collapsed, bleeding heavily from deep stab wounds all over her body and was last night said to be in ‘critical’ condition.

Police found an ‘extremely shocking’ scene, with blood spattered across the house in a quiet Manchester street and Ayeshea lying side-by-side with her dead father.

Shortly afterwards, as officers hunted the killer, a suspect hijacked a car at knifepoint and drove the vehicle into the side of a pub as he was being approached by a police patrol.

Police found Darren Gasper, 34, slumped over the wheel suffering serious stab wounds. He later died in hospital.

Last night detectives were mystified over a motive for the attack. They are examining the possibility it may have been a robbery that went horrifically wrong.

Unemployed Gasper was known to the family and officers say he may have seen the DJ as an easy target.

A police source said: ‘It is a possibility the attack was a robbery or burglary or simply a heated argument that erupted into an armed struggle.

‘The scene was extremely shocking and it is clear a violent fight had taken place.

‘The injuries all three received were horrendous.’

Ayeshea, who lives with her mother, Samantha Collins, 41, a care worker, had been staying at her father’s house.

The Manchester Communication Academy pupil had been looking forward to her school holidays.

Greater Manchester Police said they were called to an address in Moston at around 10.20pm on Sunday, following reports of a disturbance.

Mr Jackson, nicknamed ‘Jacko’, was a DJ at a number of pubs and clubs in Manchester.

He was said to be friends with Happy Mondays percussionist Mark ‘Bez’ Berry and knew Oasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher.

Mystery: The two dead men appear to be the only people involved in the incident, which has left 13-year-old Ayeshea Jackson badly injured

He had split from Miss Collins and lived alone with his dog in the quiet cul-de-sac.

Neighbour Linda Bradley, 46, said: 
‘He totally doted on his daughter. He and her mum split up a long time 
ago but were still friendly.

'Ayeshea is a beautiful girl, quite quiet but all smiling. She always stopped to say “Hi” when she went by.

‘Jacko was respectable, he didn’t drink heavily or do drugs – he wasn’t that sort.’

In 2011 Ayeshea was visited by 
Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand after she 
underwent an operation to correct curvature of the spine.

Smash: At around 1am today a 34-year-old man crashed his car into this wall at the Alliance Inn pub in Manchester

Remnants: Parts of the crashed car lay strewn on the floor outside the pub next to the huge dent in its side

Incident: The suspect had crashed after police spotted him, and he later died in hospital with stab and crash injuries

Her friend Tasha, 18, said: ‘I’ve known her since she was a baby. This is devastating and shocking.’

A resident who said he was friends with both men said: ‘Jacko was a bit of a hippy, into his music.

'Darren was more one of the boys. He’d been in jail. He was a tough kid, a big lad.’

Gasper’s father Daniel, 57, said he was devastated by the loss of his son, father to a six-year-old child.

He added: ‘The bottom line is we don’t know what has happened yet.’

Detective Superintendent Simon Barraclough said: ‘We are not looking for anyone else in relation to this incident.’

Incident: Police were then called after a driver had his car hijacked in Watfield Walk Harpurhey (pictured), and a man then crashed into the side of a pub and later died
