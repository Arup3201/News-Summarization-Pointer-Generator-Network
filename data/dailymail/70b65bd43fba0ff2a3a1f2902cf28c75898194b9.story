I don't know about you, but when the sun's out and the mercury is rising, my inclination is to go make-up free. I like to feel the sun on my skin (I'll be wearing sunscreen, natch) and to take advantage of the vitamin D boost I get from its rays.

There are summer occasions, however, that demand a properly made-up face. So this week I've called on the expert help of the fabulous Daniel Sandler – make-up artist extraordinaire and all-round beauty guru – to conjure the perfect summer party look.

'It's the ideal time of year to experiment with bright make-up colours – they never go out of fashion,' explains Daniel.

When it comes to a summer party look, Daniel Sandler recommends lots of bright colours

'This year it's all about corals, pinks and peaches – all fantastic for summertime. The look I've chosen focuses the bright colour on lips and cheeks, paired with smoky party eyes. Gorgeous!'

Begin with a light base like Vichy Aera Tint Pure Cream Foundation for a fresh, dewy finish – or if your skin's a bit more blemish-prone, opt for a foundation with a bit more coverage such as Clarins Skin Illusion Foundation.

THE EYES

Draw your eyeliner pencil along the upper lash line. Daniel used black, but you could try purple, dark green or inky blue for an added hit of colour.

Look out for a waterproof eyeliner pencil (especially in the summer months when it's hot and sticky) as this will help the lock the colour in place – try Clarins' excellent Waterproof Eyeliner Pencil. Draw the colour from inner to outer corners of your eyes, and then along the lower lash line, extending out into a flick. You can also try a liquid liner such as Guerlain Liquid Eyeliner for a more defined winged effect.

Daniel recommends only a light dusting of blusher for the summer months

Binky says she likes to be bare-faced during the summer months but there are a few occasions when you need to be made-up - a summer party being one

Now take Butter London's Wink Eye Pencil in Cheerio, a luscious golden hue, and draw it along the water line to make your eyes really pop. Finally, volumise upper and lower lashes with a coat of Daniel Sandler Waterproof mascara.

THE CHEEKS

'My go-to summer colour for Binky is my Daniel Sandler Watercolour Blusher in Acid,' reveals the make-up artist. 'You only need the tiniest bit of this brilliant liquid blusher, blended onto the cheek bones with a wide, flat brush, and the colour will last all night long.'

If you're a bit more daring with your make-up, try the Watercolour Blusher in the vivid orange Trip shade for a super-cool rave-style look.

Daniel has created a look that isn't too clogged with make-up so that your skin can still breath in the summer months

A lip stain is great for when it's hot as it isn't as sticky as a high shine gloss

THE LIPS

You can also use Daniel's Watercolour Blusher on your lips as a lip stain, simply dabbed on with your fingertip. It's simple, easy and super-effective.

Thanks Daniel! You can pick up Daniel Sandler beauty products – and tons of other amazing beauty treats - at online boutique Escentual.com.

The great thing about this look is that it doesn't use too many products and is quick to apply - so my face doesn't feel heavily clogged with make-up and yet I look glam enough for a special summer party. Now all I need is an exciting invitation and I'm good to go!

Until next week, stay beautiful.
