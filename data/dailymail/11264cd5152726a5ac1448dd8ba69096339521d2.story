Marks & Spencer is launching its own brand of English whisky after signing a deal with one of the country's select few distilleries.

Fine Single Malt English Whisky will go on sale this week, made for the retailer by the English Whisky Company at the St George’s Distillery in Norfolk.

'It is the first time we have bottled for one of the big six supermarkets,' Andrew Nelstrop, the company’s managing director, said. 'We have always sold under our own brand before.'

The spirit is made for M&S by The English Whisky Company, which now produces the equivalent of 150,000 bottles a year. Prince Charles signed one of the first batch barrels in 2007.

English whisky is a growing industry. The English Whisky Company began life in 2006 and since then a number of brewers have started micro-distilleries, including Adnams, which now also produces gin.

The recipe for M&S is, as Mr Melstrop told The Times, is a light and gentle, with a hint of smoke.

The seeds of the English Whisky Company were sown by Lincolnshire farmer James Nelstrop, who hit 60 in 2005 decided not to retire but instead indulge his major passion - whisky.

Whisky production  had stopped in England over 100 years ago and it was his dream to resurrect it by building a distillery in Norfolk to take advantage of the county's quality Barley and Breckland water. 

Prince Charles visited the English Whisky Company in 2007. Since then a number of distilleries have cropped up, with many more on the way

He recruited a distiller from Laphroaig and in December 2006 was able to make the first 29 barrels of English whisky.

Since the original distillations back in 2006, the company has made nearly 2,000 casks. It is now exporting to the United States and has even sold a couple of thousand bottles to spirit lovers in Scotland.

Mr Nelstrop says he is pleased that English distilleries are now popping up throughout the country.

'When you go into a spirits store, you usually see a wall of Scotch, a shelf each of Irish and Japanese whisky and then everything else as "other",' he said. 'I want English whisky to have its own shelf.'
