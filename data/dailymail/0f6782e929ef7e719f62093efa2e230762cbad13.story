Medical attention: Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail in south-east London

The prison officers involved in a violent incident with one of the men accused of killing Fusilier Lee Rigby deny any wrongdoing.

Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail in south-east London on Wednesday.

It is understood several officers were called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently and he was injured during the subsequent melee in the prison’s high-security wing.

Today, the Prison Officers' Association (POS) said it is 'angry that the Ministry of Justice have done little to avoid sensationalist reporting' of what happened.

The Ministry has refused to confirm that Adebolajo has been injured.

Last night, the Metropolitan Police said it had started an investigation but no arrests have been made.

In a statement, the POA said the officers involved 'strenuously deny any wrongdoing' and that the prisoner had been 'subjected to restraint using techniques' which are 'only used where necessary'.

It added: 'Our members strenuously deny any wrongdoing and the POA will be supporting them legally and emotionally during this difficult time.

'The use of restraint is only used where necessary when dealing with incidents up and down the country.

'The POA will fully co-operate with any police investigation and are hopeful that this matter will be resolved quickly and we expect the officers to be completely exonerated.'

Adebolajo, from Romford, east London, is one of two men accused of murdering Fusilier Rigby outside Woolwich barracks on May 22.

When he appeared in court last month charged with the murder, he complained about his treatment at the hands of prison staff.

During the June 5 hearing via 
video-link from the prison, he was flanked by prison officers in full 
riot gear.

Belmarsh staff asked for him to be handcuffed on the basis he
 was ‘unpredictable’ and had refused to comply with their orders.

The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, terminated the video-link after Adebolajo launched into a series of rants against prison staff.

The unit in which he is being detained
 has the highest security classification in the country, and holds 
notorious terror suspects and dangerous felons.

Inmates have included Al Qaeda 
preacher Abu Qatada until his deportation earlier this month, and 
fanatic Abu Hamza, who was extradited to the US last year. The cost of 
keeping each inmate in the unit is estimated at £65,000 a year.

Crowds of wellwishers line the street as the funeral cortege of Fusilier Lee Rigby drives away from Bury Parish church on July 12 following a funeral service attended by 800

A November 2009 inspection report on 
Belmarsh criticised the ‘extremely high’ amount of force used to control
 inmates at the prison, and said large numbers of inmates claimed they 
had been intimidated by prison staff.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘The police are investing an incident which took place at HMP Belmarsh on July 17.

‘It would be inappropriate to comment while the investigation is ongoing.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We 
can confirm that an allegation of assault was passed to the Metropolitan
 Police on July 17 by Belmarsh Prison. An investigation has been 
started.’

Rigby, 25, a father of one from Middleton, Rochdale, died 
from multiple wounds after he was attacked in the street.

The Prime Minister and thousands of 
mourners attended his military funeral last week, at which his 
two-year-old son Jack wore a T-shirt bearing the words ‘My Daddy My 
Hero’.

Adebolajo is charged with murder and 
possessing a revolver. He is also accused of the attempted murder of two
 police officers.

His alleged accomplice, Michael Adebowale, 22, is 
charged with murder and possession of a firearm.
