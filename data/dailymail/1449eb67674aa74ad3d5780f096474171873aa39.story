Expensive: British pub-goers pay up to ten times more tax on beer than 
other European drinkers

British pub-goers pay up to ten times more tax on a pint of beer than other European drinkers.

A group of MPs is urging the government to scrap their 2008 beer duty escalator which has seen a 42 per cent increase on beer tax in the last four years.

With Britons paying an average of £177 a year in beer tax and a 15 per cent drop in beer sales, the MPs are set to debate the issue tomorrow in parliament.

In Spain and Germany, pub-goers pay just £15 in comparison and in France, the Netherlands and Belgium the bill is £21 to £39.

Since the introduction of the beer duty escalator, which increases the duty by two per cent above inflation each year, some 6,000 pubs closed their doors as beer taxation cost pub owners around £66,000 per year.

The British Beer and Pub Association have welcomed the MP's campaign after an e-petition was signed by more than 100,000 people. 

Brigid Simmonds, the association’s chief executive, said: ‘I welcome this decision; which shows many MPs are indeed listening to the public on this issue. 

‘This is about consumers - pub goers, beer drinkers and licensees who hate the tax which hits everyone hard. 

‘The task now is to persuade the Government that excessive tax hikes are the wrong policy, hurting jobs and pubs when instead, we could be delivering growth and employment.’

Tory MP Andrew Griffiths told politics.co.uk: ‘Every time someone drinks cider instead of bitter the Treasury lose 50p.

their doors with the tax costing pub owners around £66,000 per year

‘Is it any wonder the cider industry is benefiting because it's able to spend that money marketing its product?

‘The Treasury's own figures reveal that even with the escalator it'll raise no extra revenue over the next two years, because it's hitting beer sales and encouraging people to drink other things.’

A Treasury spokesperson said: ‘The revenues from alcohol duty make an important contribution to tackling Britain's debt crisis.

‘Budget 2012's duty increase and increases to 2014-2015 form part of our credible plan to reduce Britain's debt, which is required to ensure low interest rates and a stable platform for growth.

‘British drinkers are being penalised with disastrous results.’
