 

An explosive new book claims to uncover some of the shocking lows that have accompanied Kate Moss’ meteoric rise to establishing herself as a fashion icon and supermodel who has remained at the top of her field for the past quarter of a century.

Champagne Supernova lifts the lid on her humble beginnings, how she came to define the ‘grunge’ look of the 90s and how despite all the tremendous success that followed she repeatedly sought escape in sex, drugs and alcohol - especially after Johnny Depp 'broke her heart.'

Kate was famously discovered by a modeling agent at age 14, as she walked through JFK Airport with her middle-class British parents.

An explosive new book claims to uncover some of the shocking lows that have accompanied Kate Moss’ meteoric rise to establishing herself as a fashion icon over the past quarter of a century

But her road to supermodel success was no sure thing. As a skinny, flat-chested teen with crooked teeth, her look was completely at odds with the ‘Glamazons’ and gold-plated excess of the 1980s, writes author Maureen Callahan.

A Polaroid of Kate was stuck in the ‘maybe’ drawer until her mentor, the fashion photographer Corinne Day, rescued it and launched her career in 1990 with a striking image featured on the cover of UK style bible The Face. 

When Day discovered Kate in Croydon, South London, her parents were separating and she was skipping school to party at a local pub and get high. She had also lost her virginity at fourteen.

In 1992, Kate was picked as the new face of Calvin Klein.

Self-conscious about her small breasts, she dreaded the topless ads and didn’t like being teamed up with Mark Wahlberg, known then as Marky Mark who had ‘a bulging physique and a bad attitude’ and ‘spent downtime tugging his d**k while Kate rolled her eyes’, writes Callahan.

Wahlberg thought Kate looked like his nephew.

But the decision to feature Kate in the stripped-down CK ads proved a masterstroke for both parties as it helped turn the ailing fashion label around and also made her a household name.

Soon she was the sole face of Calvin Klein jeans – with her photo soon featured on the sides of buses, kiosks, pay phones - naked and draped across a sofa.

She became the ‘grunge goddess of the U.K.’ and quickly rose to international acclaim, but soon the success started to take its toll on the young model.

Kate had been described as ‘no glamor, no figure, bowed legs and jagged teeth and one eye that was slight off-center’, but suddenly she was considered the epitome of the new grunge aesthetic.

Her drinking escalated and sometimes she didn’t get out of bed for two weeks, writes Callahan.

‘Nobody takes care of you mentally’, Kate said of her sudden success. ‘I thought I was going to die’.

Two years later in 1994, Kate was the face of YSL Opium perfume. At Café Tabac in New York's East Village, she met the man she had been obsessing over for months, actor Johnny Depp.

‘Both had ravenous appetites for alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, sex. Kate was the accidental supermodel, Depp the punk-rock Beat poet who just happened to become a movie star,’ writes Callahan.

Kate threw herself into partying with her movie-star and rock-star friends in North London and is reported to have enjoyed a threesome with Jude Law and his then wife wife Sadie Frost

When Kate hooked up with Depp, he was divorced from his first wife, Lori Anne Allison and had been engaged to Jennifer Grey, Sherilyn Fenn and Winona Ryder.

‘Kate and Johnny were the chicest, druggiest couple since Keith Richards and Anita Pallenberg’, writes Callahan. 

But Kate feared Johnny’s moods and was afraid he’d leave her. She was constantly insecure about her face, her small breasts, short legs, and bad teeth. 

By 1996, her drug  use had spiraled out of controlled while Depp was slowing down, claims Callahan. He couldn’t take it any longer.

‘In one sitting she could snort three grams of coke and drink a bottle of vodka, which a doctor said was the best liquor for preserving her looks,’ writes Callahan. She was called ‘the Tank’ for drinking so hard and fast.

Depp and Moss broke up for good after the premiere of his directorial debut, the Brave, at Cannes in 1997. 

He couldn’t live with her in New York because he couldn’t take her wild partying and neediness. He told Kate she was ‘a crazy b****’, a friend told Callahan.

‘Johnny broke her heart. She went mad’. She was spinning out of control on drugs - heroin and booze. ‘She just wouldn’t stop with the drugs and the drinking’.

In 2005 Kate hooked up with singer Pete Doherty, left, ‘a junkie, thief and former gay hustler’, before marrying Jamie Hince, right, in 2011

‘Kate had the highest tolerance…, capable of doing ‘cocaine, champagne in piles, an eight-ball by herself…and not even be fazed by it’, the author quotes a friend. 

‘She can drink anyone under the table …a liter of vodka in one sitting. There’s not much she doesn’t like. She doesn’t like her own company. She’s addled by the drugs and doesn't like to think’.

Kate threw herself into partying with her movie-star and rock-star friends in North London. They became known in the tabloids as 'the Primrose Hill set,' after the posh neighborhood they shared. 

Around this time it was reported in the British tabloids that Kate was enjoying hookups with several of her female friends - including Jude Law’s wife, Sadie Frost, who, a friend says, began to fall in love with Kate. 

'They all partied together, slept together,' a colleague tells Callahan. 'It was a very soulless life they led.' 

'She doesn’t like her own company,' said one family friend of that time. 'She’s addled by the drugs and doesn’t like to think.'

When Depp hooked up with French singer Vanessa Paradis - who became pregnant within weeks - Kate spun even more out of control.

She took off for a wild two weeks in Ibiza, and Jason Lake, her island hookup, expressing amazement that this 'kinda rough' girl who knocked back vodka and tequila every night was the world’s most famous model.

In the early 90s Kate became the sole face of Calvin Klein jeans and her photo featured on the sides of buses, kiosks, pay phones - naked and draped across a sofa

'I was living fast,' Kate said of that time. 'It was, "Sleep? Why? Why not go on? There’s too much to do.'"

She eventually checked into the Priory, the mental health rehab center in South West London for five weeks, but only a few days after leaving she was back on the drugs, writes Callahan.

‘She hadn’t walked down a runway sober in over a decade or done a shoot where she wasn’t on something’.

She partied in Thailand with Ronnie Wood’s son Jesse and in March was rushed to the hospital.

She started seeing a psychiatrist once a week and going to AA and Narcotics Anonymous.

Keeping her partying behind closed doors, she was even more out of control and was known to 'station herself outside the bathroom door, yelling, "Anyone want a f***?'", writes Callahan.

By 2000, she was a fashion icon without having to walk a catwalk. Five years later, when she hooked up with singer Pete Doherty, ‘a junkie, thief and former gay hustler’, she was back on heroin, claims Callahan. 

When photographs surfaced of her chopping up cocaine, she lost her contracts. Back into rehab, she broke off with Doherty and again quit heroin. In 2011 she married her husband Jamie Hince and the couple remain together to this day. 

Kate became the ‘grunge goddess of the U.K.’, but soon the success started to take its toll and  friends called her 'the Tank' because she drank so hard and fast

Today Kate Moss has remained at top of her field for so long that it’s difficult to remember a time before she was a model.

As she has matured, her unique style has emerged, mixing high-end designer items with vintage finds, dresses with sneakers and shorts with rain boots. 

Callahan argues that Moss is the most influential model in history, inspiring fashion lines from paparazzi street photos and popularizing staples like skinny jeans and ballet flats.

Champagne Supernovas also looks at the careers of two of the other biggest names of the 90s fashion era - designers Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen.

The book's title has three meanings: 'champagne supernova' is a psychedelic song by the '90s rock band Oasis and can refer to bubbly in a martini glass rimmed with cocaine. 

A supernova is also when a star gets so bright it explodes, the perfect metaphor for all three profiled in the book.
