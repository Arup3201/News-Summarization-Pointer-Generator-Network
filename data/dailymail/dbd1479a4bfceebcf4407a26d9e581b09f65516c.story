A dying father is attempting to raise £500,000 to help save his five-year-old daughter who has beaten cancer twice but could relapse at any time.

Tom Attwater, 30, is battling a terminal brain tumour but is ignoring his own health problems and desperately trying to raise the cash needed to help save his daughter Kelli’s life.

Time is running out for Mr Attwater, who has already raised £425,000 needed for her treatment, after doctors confirmed his tumour was growing.

He said: ‘People in my situation make bucket lists - but there is only one thing on mine.‘All that matters is raising money to make sure Kelli can get the medical help she will need if she relapses but it really is a race against time.’

He added: ‘I’ve run out of chances, luck and time but I’ve had a great life. My brain tumour is getting worse and I am finding it harder to do normal things.

‘Some people have advised me to slow down and concentrate on enjoying the rest of my days. ‘But all that matters is making sure that I raise enough money for Kelli so she can have the best chance of a long and happy and healthy life.

The business manager is £75,000 short of his target to help Kelli, who has been battling neuroblastoma – the most common children’s cancer – since she was three-months-old.

Despite battling a brain tumour, Tom Attwater is desperately trying to raise £500,000 for treatment for Kelli

Doctors have confirmed Mr Attwater's tumour was growing but he has already raised £425,000 for her

The family (pictured Tom with his with Joely Attwater, right, and their daughter Kelli, centre) were told if the cancer returns she will need specialist treatment which she can only get in the United States

Although clear of the disease at the moment, doctors say her chance of relapse remains high.

The family, from Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands, were told if the cancer returns she will need specialist treatment which she can only get in the United States.

Mr Attwater said: ‘I am just pleading with people to help my daughter - anything will make a difference, 50p or a £1.’

Kelli was two-years-old when he met her mother Joely Attwater, 26, three years ago and he soon became her father.

The pair bonded after Kelli went through a series of operations to remove tumours - just months before Mr Attwater was then diagnosed with brain cancer.

Tom is pleading with people to donate what they can even though he might not get to see it through

Tom has received more than 17,000 donations ranging from £1 to £10,000 after posting appeal for help online

He said: ‘I will never get to see my beautiful daughter grow up as I so want to. I don’t blame people or the world for this. A lot of life is simply luck and mine has run out.

‘I am going to miss so much - her first day at school, her first date, to hold her when her heart hurts.

'Most dads and daughters have decades to chat around the kitchen tables, their hands warmed by mugs of coffee, as the dad dishes out advice. We don’t have that time.'

‘Now my final gift to Kelli will be trying to raise the money so she can live a great and happy life. It will be my legacy to her.

‘I don’t know if we will make the £500,000 before I die but I can only hope our story will touch people’s heart to want to help make my dying wish come true.’

Mr Attwater has received more than 17,000 donations ranging from £1 to £10,000 for his campaign after posting an emotional appeal for help on the internet in 2013.

Kelli was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when she was three months old. She underwent seven months of chemotherapy and several operations

Mr Attwater was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour in September 2012 and was told it was terminal in April 2013.

Mrs Attwater, 26, a primary education student, said: 'It was a double blow for me.

'Tom didn’t look anything up on the internet, but I couldn’t help myself.

'He only wanted to know how much time he had left. His life expectancy is two to three years, and he’s already had one.'

The chemotherapy Kelli had also makes her more likely to develop other types of cancer, including leukaemia

Mr Attwater had suffered from headaches but did not think it was anything serious until he collapsed and suffered a seizure in his sister’s kitchen.

Doctors found a tumour in his brain. If it had been left much longer the pressure would have killed him.

Mr Attwater said: 'When I found out it was terminal, part of me did think, "I’m a 29-year-old man and I’ve achieved nothing".

'But then I made lists of things I wanted to do - one for a month, one for six, one for a year and so on.

'We’d love to have another child but right now I just need to make sure that if the worst does happen Kelli will be looked after.

'I know half a million pounds is a lot of money, but the chances of Kelli relapsing are so high.

'If 1,000 pubs or shops had a collection box then in a year we’d have achieved what we need to.

'We’re trying everything - sponsored events, selling wristbands, collection boxes. I don’t want to hit that target, I need to.

‘For anyone who reads my story,
 especially if you are a parent yourself, please help us - knowing I can
 do this one final thing for my daughter before I die would be the best 
thing in the world.’
