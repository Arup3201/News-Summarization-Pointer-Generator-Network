A village school which has six members of staff on its payroll despite having no pupils has been branded a 'fiasco'.

All the children have now left the small, rural Ravenstonedale Endowed School in Cumbria following an 'inadequate' Ofsted inspection in April yet a cook, two teaching assistants, a cleaner and a secretary – all being paid a full-salary – join the headmistress Vicki Boggon every day.

Andy Silvester of the Tax Payers' Alliance called the situation a 'complete fiasco' and said that taxpayers would be 'baffled'.

He added: 'It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that a school without pupils doesn't need any staff.

'The process of closing the school, and reassigning these staff to places where they can actually contribute to a child's education, must be sped up.'

Adding to the odd situation, Cumbria County Council, who took over the running of Ravenstonedale, have suggested in a 'consultation on closure' document, that that the school may stay open for another seven months.

Trouble started at the small school near Kirkby Steven, Cumbria, when it was put under 'special measures' after inspectors who arrived on April 30 at half a day's notice found 'there are too many incidents of racist and homophobic bullying, together with some serious instances of violence towards one another'.

The news shocked and confused the quiet community because there were only 13 pupils at the school and they were all white.

But  the chairman of governors at Ravenstonedale, has claimed the report was based on a single incident of children using the word 'gay' as a throwaway comment and not knowing what it meant.

She said she believed that Ofsted had an agenda against small schools and suspected they'd been unfairly labelled racist because racism and homophobia were treated as one category by Ofsted.

Since the damning report every one of the pupils enrolled has now been taken out of the school.

By September there were just two pupils left, and within the past month that number has dwindled to zero.

Parents of children at Ravenstonedale Endowed School have described the Ofsted report as 'ludicrous'

A Cumbria County Council spokesman said: 'Despite a positive recent Ofsted monitoring visit, unfortunately the school now has no pupils attending.

'As a result the council will begin a consultation on the future of the school from October 27 which runs until 21 November.

'We're exploring options with staff about how we might be able to deploy them to other schools when close-down procedures have been completed.

'In doing this, we have to follow Human Resources law and their employment rights by consulting with staff and working with them to look at what their options might be.'

Ravenstonedale is centred on a single main street, though there are many scattered dwellings on the periphery. There are two pubs in the village

Although the school has no pupils, there are still people in the area who would prefer it to stay open.

Paul Bonsall, the 63-year-old owner of the Fat Lamb Hotel, Ravenstonedale is one of them although he chose to send his children, now in their thirties, to a different school. He said: 'It would be a real shame if the school ceased to exist completely as it was once at the very centre of village life.

'However I agree that they shouldn't be paying all six members of staff to keep it open.

'It probably only needs the headmistress to complete whatever tasks still need to be dealt with even without any pupils.'
