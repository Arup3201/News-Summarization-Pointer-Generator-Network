Middle aged professional men who vote Conservative are the most likely to be involved in road rage rows, a study has found.

Cyclists, drivers and pedestrians who come to blows are likely to be in their 40s or 50s, Tory and well-off.

A YouGov poll of 1,900 British adults found that 43 per cent of people have been a victim of road rage.

Anger: Tory-voting middle aged men are the most likely to get involved in road rage incidents, a YouGov poll has found. The figures come as a new documentary called Road Rage Britain, pictured, is screened on ITV

Stats: 43 per cent of people have been involved in a road rage incident, the study found. The ITV documentary will be screened tonight - and shows some shocking incidents of road rage like this fight pictured

And one in five admit committing acts of anger at others’ expense.

There are more cars on the roads than ever before – and people are cycling far more than they used to.

More and more people are competing for a limited amount of road space, leading to furious rows on our streets.

An ITV documentary to be screened this evening reveals some of the most outrageous acts of violence committed by drivers and cyclists.

Using footage filmed on helmet-mounted and dashboard cameras, the programme taps into the pressures commuters are under.

In one segment, a middle-aged gentleman, smartly dressed in red trousers, a shirt and V-necked pullover, comes to blows with a cyclist.

With the cyclist sprawling on the ground, the enraged driver lifts the bicycle over his head and brings it crashing down on his opponent’s body.

The programme conducts an experiment, in which two cyclists swap modes of transport with a London cabbie and a white van man, to try to understand the causes of road rage.

Cycle courier Nick Swinden, 37, from Archway, London, who features in the show, said: ‘I’ve been chased by cab drivers, minicabs, van drivers, the works. Fisticuffs have been thrown in the past, yes.’

Preston-based white van driver Gaz McPartland, 38, told the programme makers: ‘I can’t be doing with cyclists. If I’m paying tax on the road then I want to be able to ride on the road.

‘They don’t pay tax so why should they ride three or four deep?’

Road Rage Britain: Caught on Camera will be broadcast at 9pm on ITV tonight
