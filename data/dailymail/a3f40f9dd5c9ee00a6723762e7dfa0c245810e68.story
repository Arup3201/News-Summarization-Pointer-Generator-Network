Big Issue bosses claimed today its magazine sellers are being muscled out of their pitches by aggressive beggars making £400 a day.

The charity, which offers people who are homeless the opportunity to earn their own money, said beggars in Birmingham are pocketing £2,800 per week, then spending it on drink and drugs.

Becky Mitchell, manager of the magazine's West Midlands base, said the amount was revealed to her by one of her 25-strong band of Big Issue sellers.

The Big Issue offers people who are homeless the opportunity to earn their own money. It was founded by John Bird and Gordon Roddick in September 1991.

Ms Mitchell added: 'What they do is illegal. A beggar who is constantly in the public's face can earn a lot more money.'

Big Issue sales support manager Freddie Barrett added: 'The money beggars earn is not saved. There isn't anything left by the end of the week - it all goes on things like drink and drugs.'

The pair also accused the culprits of depriving legitimate Big Issue sellers of their meagre £35-a-day income.

Ms Barrett added: 'Our vendors can get bullied for their magazines, but we work closely with West Midlands Police and street wardens.

'People make a judgement. It's schoolboy bullying. No one wants to be bottom of the heap, so they pick on people they think are.

'They are constantly told to get a job, but they have a job - a really hard job. These are people on the way up, people who are ready for a change.

'Everyone who walks through our door is a success because they are ready to stand on their own two feet.'

Big Issue sellers pay £1.25 for each copy - which they sell for £2.50 - and have to buy their own red tabard for £15.

One Big Issue seller - who fled his home in Kenilworth, Warkwickshire, because of bullying - told how he was spat at less than a month ago.

Ollie Bain, 34, said: 'Three weeks ago a girl spat in my face and I've had people telling me they'll smash my face in.

'I'm constantly told to get a job. I don't know what they think I'm doing. We are not scrounging, we are working for our money.

'People don't realise how lucky they are. They have a roof over their head, but some people need a little help.'

Last year two Big Issue sellers Ian Watson-Gladwish, 31, and Wayne Busst, 32, were stabbed to death in Union Street in Birmingham.

Paranoid schizophrenic John Ward, 24, admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained for life with a minimum of 12 years behind bars.
