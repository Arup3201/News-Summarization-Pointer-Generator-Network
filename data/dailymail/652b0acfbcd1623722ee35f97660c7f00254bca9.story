You won't find any Gatorade spills on this kitchen top.

Abandoned for decades, this perfectly pink, immaculately clean kitchen is frozen in time. 

The 1962 masterpiece in Chicago was discovered by furniture collector Nathan Chandler 17 years ago.

It boasts blonde wood, star-shaped handles, and all pink appliances including a General Electric combination wall mount refrigerator, and an automatic built-in oven.

Finally, on February 15, the kitchen was sold.

In a move that should hopefully maintain its spotlessness, the buyer received a few cases of vintage washing up powder that was left 59 years ago.

Frozen in time! This 1962 masterpiece kitchen in Chicago was discovered by furniture collector Nathan Chandler last year

Vintage: Nobody has lived here since, and the 59-year-old General Electric appliances look good as new

Stunning: The place is decked out in blonde wood, geometric silver handles and pastel pink enamel, which came into fashion in the 1950s

Art deco: Gold and illustrated patterns were making a comeback at the time, and earned a spot in this kitchen as light shades

Practical: The built-in refrigerator is raised up so easy to access for the budding chef in this immaculate home, which has been sold

A few leftovers...: The lucky buyer, who snapped up the kitchen on February 15, inherited some vintage cookbooks as well

Shining: The squeaky clean kitchen tops, four-inch-squared tiles, and silver add-ons gleam in the sunlight

Ready and waiting: The kitchen hasn't seen much use as nobody has used it since 1962, according to furniture collector Nathan Chandler

What a find! Chandler was amazed to discover the kitchen - a vintage lover's dream - as most have been renovated as least partially

All in working order: It may have been left alone but the appliances look brand new and manicured

Keep it up! Hopefully the leftover vintage washing powder in the retro circular dishwasher will help the new owner to keep it clean

A glimpse into history: This is the kind of manual that would greet a buyer in the 1950s and 1960s

Artistic: Even the spirals of the stoves look artistic and museum-quality 

Don't spill anything! With pink lining the stove tops, budding chefs will have to be very careful when cooking dinner

Saving grace: If there are any spillages, at least these spotless silver caps will be on hand to cover it all up

That's handy! In perfect calligraphy, the dishwasher handle is inscribed with its product name to help navigate the kitchen
