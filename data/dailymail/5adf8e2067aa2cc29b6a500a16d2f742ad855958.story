Lolo Jones was only selected for the Olympic bobsled team because of her fame, her teammates have claimed.

When the team was announced on Sunday, fellow teammates - including those forced to take up spots as alternates on the team - were reportedly 'shocked' by the decision.

'It's hard for me to name one or two 
athletes that would completely agree with that decision,' veteran 
brakeman Curt Tomasevicz told USA Today.

Katie Eberling, who will be in Sochi as an alternate after Jones beat her for a place on the team, said the sport had now been 'tainted' for her as she questioned the motivation for the decision.

'I feel this year there was a certain agenda,' Eberling told USA Today. 'It's no fault of my teammates. There's been a lot of inconsistencies and that makes you wonder what's going on. It's not right.'

This season, Jones won two World Cup silvers in races while Eberling won three bronzes.

In the past week, Jones, who has 375,000 Twitter followers and more than 117,500 on Instagram, has appeared on NBC's Nightly News, on the Today show. At the end of 2013, she took part in a photo shoot for Women's Health.

The 31-year-old, who famously revealed she was a virgin before the 2012 Olympics, is a two-time Olympic hurdler. She was named the favorite to take gold in 2008 but tripped on a hurdle.Â

Her high profile is now detracting from the talent of the team, other athletes have claimed.

'We're returning gold medalists and not 
getting much PR because all the bobsled attention is on Lolo,' 
Tomasevicz told USA Today. 'It brings a lot of attention to the sport 
which can be a good thing, but I'm not just sure who is benefiting from 
that attention.'

Emily 
Azevedo, who also missed out on a spot on the team, added: 'I should have been working harder on 
gaining Twitter followers than gaining muscle mass.'

Avevedo is also an alternate but has 
chosen not to accept the opportunity to be with the team during training
 in Germany before heading to Sochi. But she said she will be ready if a
 teammate is injured.

Bobsled officials were forced to release a statement defending their choice on Thursday night.

'We followed the procedure and I'll stand
 by that decision all day long,' U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation CEO Darrin Steele said.

'It was a really close call. The numbers 
were close. There's no question about it. That always makes it more 
difficult. The trending was going toward Lolo and she's a great athlete 
and at the end of the day that's who we think is a better brakeman for 
the Games.

'I haven't heard anyone making the argument about Lolo not being a better athlete right now, a better brakeman for the team. I don't think I've come across that one time.

'I've heard a lot about history. But who's going to provide the best results for the U.S. team in Sochi? That's the bottom line. And I'll have that debate with anyone who wants to have it.'

And on Friday morning, teammate Elana Meyes leaped to Jones' defense, tweeting: 'extremely proud to have @AjaLEvans @LaurynCwilliams & @lolojones as Olympic teammates- they fought hard and earned it #wolfpack'.

She added on Facebook: 'I have tried to remain quiet as long as possible, but some things must be clarified. We have a phenomenal group of women competing for the US Olympic team this year.

But difficult choices had to be made to narrow it down to 3 athletes for the Olympic team. The three athletes that were chosen for the Olympic team were chosen because of the numbers they have put up this season...

'We should be celebrating our Olympians, not tearing them down... I am devastated for those who didn't make the team but I will celebrate for those who did.'

The team was chosen by a committee 
including both the men's and women's coaches and based on the season's 
results. Other criteria, such as international experience, is also taken
 into consideration.

There have also been suggestions that the choice is a plan between NBC and Olympic officials to drum up publicity for the games after learning headline-grabber Lindsey Vonn will not be taking part.

'Now it's clear: This is the two-straw love affair that NBC needed after losing Lindsey Vonn,' Selena Roberts wrote in a column for Sports On Earth.

'Lolo is the replacement star, the sex appeal sub for the injured ski queen, a hot storyline to ride down bobsled's serpentine track. NBC's convenience is another's conspiracy.'

But NBC executives responded that the claim was 'utterly ridiculous' and 'preposterous'.

Jones, who is training with the team 
in Germany, has not yet responded to a request for comment.

But after she was picked on Sunday, she said that the selection process for bobsled is more 
'stressful' than that for hurdles.

'As
 the season goes on you do gain bonds with those other girls so it's 
hard to celebrate when you know what they went through to achieve the 
same kind of dream you're going to achieve,' she said.
