For a vegetarian it might seem an odd choice of past time.

But self-taught taxidermist Nicola Hebson has turned her fascination with dead animals into a prosperous venture.

The 21-year-old fine art graduate, from Blackburn in Lancashire, spends up to 20 hours carefully extracting the innards of animals before lovingly preserving the carcasses and selling them on eBay.

Nicola's unusual hobby is even more surprising as she is a dedicated vegetarian who, by her own admissions, is 'very squeamish'.

However, she is making a tidy profit with her cadaverous creations, which includes a collection of stuffed rats - one of which has been turned into a handbag.

One of her special rodents sold for £67 on eBay and the student has put the cash towards a dream trip to India.

Nicola insists her taxidermy enterprise is strictly ethical: She never kills for her art and only uses animals that are already dead, whether it is the rodent victim of her cat or roadkill she finds on the street.

Ethical enterprise: Nicola says she never kills for her art and only uses roadkill or rodents caught by her pet cat

She said: 'I have always collected 
things that i find dead, flies and moths, pigeon feathers, flattened 
dried out toads, skulls. So I think that it has kind of developed from 
that.

'This gave me the idea to practise taxidermy on mice meant for snake feed as well as any road kill I would find.

'I
am generally very squeamish to most peoples surprise. Some people get 
angry because they think I go out with a gun killing everything.

'But when I explain to them that I use road kill and frozen snake food they think its fine.

'It is more gruesome cutting up a tomato in my opinion'

'Me and my best friend, Chloe are both vegetarians and she used to hate my taxidermy, but now she has warmed to it.

'My friends and family are pretty normal about me playing with dead things and stuffing them. My mum even lets me do it in my room now.'

Nicola's collection includes 14 rodent works of art - some of which have already been sold or given away to family and friends as gifts.

Explaining her artistic technique, she added: 'If someone was to bring me a dead mouse, I would start off by putting it in the freezer for a few days.

'When I am ready to begin the taxidermy process I thaw out the mouse.

'I make an incision right down the back from the neck to near the end of the tail, with a fresh surgical blade.

'I carefully separate the membranes of skin from the skin attached to the head of the mouse.

'It is important to wire the insides so that it retains some sort of posture and structure.

'After I have filled the mouse with some sort of stuffing I sew up the back with a sturdy sewing needle and then begin to add finishing touches to the face.

'You have to leave the animal for a while in the position you want so it will dry and be sturdy.

'Also if it is a very fluffy animal such as a baby rabbit the fur will need a lot of blow drying.'

Nicola says she is influenced by an old British tradition of taxidermy art, which stretches back to the early Victorian era.

She said: 'I am very inspired by the taxidermist Walter Potter. I used to think taxidermy was a very negative and disturbing hobby until I found out about his work.

'Taxidermy is a very delicate process and if done correctly there won't be any blood at all. It is more gruesome cutting up a tomato in my opinion.'

Walter Potter, widely considered to be a master taxidermist, lived from 1835 to 1918 and created famously strange scenes of mice, rats, frogs, cats and dogs all playing together like humans in bizarre scenes.

His work was hugely popular during his lifetime - and many of his bizarre creations were displayed at a museum dedicated to him in Bramber, Sussex.

Because of financial difficulty in 1983 the collection moved to Jamaica Inn in Cornwall before being auctioned off in 2003, fetching £529,900.
