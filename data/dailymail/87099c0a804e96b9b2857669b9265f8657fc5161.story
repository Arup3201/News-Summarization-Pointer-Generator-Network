In the end, it appears that Charlotte Dawson had grown tired of fighting a battle against depression that became increasingly difficult and impossible to win.

Close friend, designer Alex Perry spoke to News Corp about how even Dawson's abundant energy and humour could not overcome the crippling mental disease which had seen her hospitalised twice in a year.

'She was a very tormented woman and really was finding it hard to battle her mental illness,' said Perry, who worked with Dawson when they were judges on Australia's Next Top Model.

'I just can’t believe she has taken her own life but . . . it was such a battle and as she got older it was harder to deal with.'

'Mental illness just made it so difficult for her to really go in so many parts of her life.'

'She obviously has tried and tried so hard to raise awareness of mental illness but it really did just totally take its toll and got on top of her.'

Final tweets: In the days before she died, Dawson reached out to people suffering because they could not afford life saving cancer surgery because of health budget cutbacks

Ms Dawson's manager, Mark Byrne, also spoke about how she had strived to hide the debilitating disease from people for years.

'Her illness was painful and well hidden until it could not be,' he told news.com.au, 'but I will miss and remember Charlotte for her energy and fun and I celebrate her legacy and amazing contribution to industry and charity.

'She is now one of Australia’s historical media figures pioneering our now booming celebrity entertainment and media industries.

'Personally she was a mentor, a loyal friend, a client and great mate; above all Charlotte was a lot of fun. Each memory is full of laughs.'

Last days: Caring to the end, Charlotte Dawson (pictured near her apartment two days before she was found dead) sent messages of support via Twitter to people who were suffering

Ms Dawson's mental battles were epitomised by the tussle between her fragile self image and her desire to a be a strong woman.

In an interview with Who Weekly, Dawson admitted to extensive plastic surgery, including having an eye lift, a breast operation, Botox, fillers and fat transfer procedure.

But she also said she believed the media’s relationship with body image was becoming increasingly destructive and young woman, such as the entrants of the Top Model competition, needed to remember they were role models.

'There are two things that disturb me — the extent of the procedures that young, beautiful girls are having and that some of them are doing it for publicity,' she said.

'They need to remember they have young fans who are 12 and 13.'

Ms Dawson's last days before the constant tweeter fell into an ominous Twitter silence, included posts of support to people who were suffering in hospital from terminal cancer.

A Twitter debate two days before she died centred on health budget cuts and how the lack of available surgeons for cancer sufferers in the public hospital system meant people were dying.

'We have hospitals/resources & the doctors and resources & the professors willing to help. Where is the support?' she tweeted on Thursday.

She added that life saving cancer surgeries were unable to proceed because they were underfunded by the public purse.

She wrote about one woman's 'horrific' plight with cancer and the she was 'facing the toughest challenge'.

She ended the tweet with 'send her love' and an emoticon heart.
