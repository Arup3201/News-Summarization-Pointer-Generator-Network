John Terry has revealed he is still haunted by the memory of his penalty miss that cost Chelsea a first Champions League title against Manchester United in Moscow almost seven years ago.

The Chelsea captain took what could have been the decisive penalty at the end of a 1-1 draw in the first ever final between two English clubs, but slipped on the run-up and hit the post to send the shoot-out into sudden death.

Nicolas Anelka went on to miss Chelsea's seventh spot-kick to hand United a domestic and European double, but Terry's miss is still seen as the decisive and iconic moment at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium.

And having cried on the pitch during the post-match ceremonies, Terry says he still wakes up at night thinking of what could have been with regular flashbacks to his slip.

‘I’ll definitely never be over it,' he said. 'I still wake up in the night now and it’s like “s***”, it’s there and then you go back to sleep.

'It’s eased over the years for sure. But I still have a few times a year when I wake up and, bang, it’s on my mind. It’ll never go. It’s one of those things, it’s disappointing, and I was gutted at the time.'

Terry admits that while he has begun to get over the pain of the memory, it still comes back to him at night

There was little time for Terry to get over his horror moment in May 2008, with the Chelsea centre back called up to the England squad for a friendly against the USA almost immediately after the final.

Terry scored in a 2-0 win at Wembley against the Americans but still ranks the build up to the game, spent with United players Wes Brown, Owen Hargreaves, Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney, as one of the worst times of his career.

‘The worst thing was, we had England the following week, we played USA at Wembley and I had to go and sit at a table with all the Man United players,' Terry told a Chelsea Pitch Owners dinner this week.

'I was just sitting there fuming. I didn’t want to be there. It was a horrible time for me.’

Chelsea did eventually go on to be crowned European champions after beating Bayern Munich on penalties in the 2012 final, but Terry was suspended after being sent off the semi-final second leg against Barcelona.

Terry lifted his knee into the back of then-Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez and was shown the red card that ruled him out of the showpiece at the Allianz Arena - but he still ranks the final as one of his best footballing moments.

Despite not playing in the final, Terry was lucky enough to win the Champions League four years later

'It was probably the worst 120 minutes I've sat through,' Terry said of the final. 'It is horrible because you want to do something, you want to make something happen, but for me, it's still the best night of my life with Chelsea.

'It goes back to Moscow, with that I wasn't meant to be part of that. I feel part of it, I played a lot of games before that but I think for me, not playing, it was meant to be. I wasn't meant to play, we were meant to win. That was it, as simple as that.

'And for me that was the most pleasing thing, to see Chelsea win the Champions League after what happened in Moscow ticked a box for me and definitely made those sleepless nights easier.'
