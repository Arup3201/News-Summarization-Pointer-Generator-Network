A fugitive emu went on the run through a quiet village after escaping from a farm - because it was being bullied.

The flightless bird was first spotted running through Combe Florey, near Taunton, Somerset, by members of a local sewing circle and stunned residents watched as it waddled through the village's streets.

It was eventually ushered into a garden where it was kept until its owner, a local farmer, arrived.

Officers contacted the owner who arrived the following day from his farm several miles away and took the emu home.

He explained to bemused locals the bird had done a runner because has being picked on by a griup of emus on the farm, known as a mob.

Jill Marshall, 51, who lives in the village, said: 'The emu came from the next village over - a distance of several miles.

'We can't figure out how he got here, whether he walked, ran or got the number nine bus.

'When the farmer came to collect him, he said that the other emus had been bullying him and that's why he ran away.

'The farmer was going to put him in another pen when they got back to the farm, so I hope he's happy now.'

Rural: The emu went for a walkabout Combe Florey in Taunton

Neilson Smith said he could not 
believe his eyes when he saw the giant creature - more likely to be 
found in its native Australia than in rural England - roaming around his
 street before it hopped over his fence.

Mr Smith said: 'It was getting stressed and I wouldn't have been surprised if it jumped back over the fence and escaped.

'My neighbour called me up and said "look out your front window, there's something strange."

'So I asked him if it was an army tank or something, and when I looked out it was an emu.

'It was well and truly on the loose.'

Mr Smith's wife Julie managed to coax the bird into their garden on December 7.

Mr Smith said: 'Police were guarding it in the garden but I don't think having patrol cars around an emu is what they're paid to do.'

Officers tracked down the owner of the escaped bird but Mr Smith was asked to keep it secure overnight until it could be collected.

Mr Smith said: 'It was collected in the morning with no ill effects.'

The emu was taken away in a horse box by the farmer the following morning.

Resident Annie Makepeace said: 'It was all very exciting - we had to stop traffic while we ushered it away.'

Feathering the nest: The scared creature is squeezed into the car in north Devon while the authorities tried to contact the owner

It is the second time in as many months that an emu has ruffled feathers in south west England.

In November, a four-foot emu was caught running through Barnstaple in north Devon and was eventually ushered into back of a police car until its owner arrived.

Police officers said catching the emu, named Betty, was the most 'bizarre' incident in their career.

Emus used to fall under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 but were delisted.

They can grow up to two metres in height and reach speeds of up to 43mph.
