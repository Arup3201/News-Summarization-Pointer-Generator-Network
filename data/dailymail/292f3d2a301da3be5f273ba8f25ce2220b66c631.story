Real Sociedad boss David Moyes has been given a two-match touchline ban after he was sent to the stands as his side were knocked out of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

Moyes was dismissed by referee Carlos Velasco Carballo after gesturing that the official needed glasses, and was seen accepting the offer of a crisp from a fan after climbing into the stands to watch the rest of the 2-2 draw against Villarreal.

But his actions have proven costly, with Moyes banned one match for his dismissal and one for climbing into the stands. The punishments were announced by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Friday.

Moyes had been unhappy with a number of decisions in the match, and his frustrations boiled over with nine minutes remaining.

Although they took a draw on the night, Moyes' men had lost the first leg 1-0 and exited the competition.

Esteban Granero equalised for Sociedad 15 minutes from time, but soon after Moyes lost his temper and was shown a red card.

As Moyes watched from above, Mateo Musacchio was sent off for Villarreal, but the damage had already been done and the Yellow Submarine went through with a 3-2 aggregate win.
