Team news

West Bromwich Albion

Captain Chris Brunt will again miss out for West Brom in their derby clash against Aston Villa.

The midfielder has failed to recover from a hamstring injury he suffered in last week's 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat to West Ham.

Jonas Olsson is out following an operation on his Achilles but Saido Berahino is set for a recall after being dropped to the bench for the goalless draw at Hull and Claudio Yacob is available following a ban.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Yacob, Davidson, Wisdom, Baird, Varela, Gardner, Morrison, O'Neil, Dorrans, Mulumbu, Blanco, Sessegnon, Samaras, Ideye, Berahino, Anichebe.

Aston Villa 

Aston Villa pair Ron Vlaar and Fabian Delph could be in contention to return to action in Saturday's local derby at West Brom.

Captain Vlaar has been out since early November with a calf injury while England rookie Delph dislocated his shoulder in October but both have returned to training and may make surprise returns.

Tom Cleverley (bruised foot) is a doubt and fellow midfielder Ashley Westwood will miss around a month with a knee injury. Forward Andi Weimann returns from suspension but defenders Philippe Senderos and Nathan Baker remain out, as does midfielder Joe Cole.

Provisional squad: Guzan, Given, Hutton, Lowton, Okore, Clark, Vlaar, Herd, Cissokho, Delph, Richardson, Sanchez, N'Zogbia, Cleverley, Grealish, Bacuna, Agbonlahor, Weimann, Benteke, Robinson.
