Thirty-one of the passengers who were aboard the ill-fated February 2013 Carnival Triumph voyage turned cruise from hell are looking for compensation for their pain and suffering in a civil case that began last week.

Emotions were high in the Miami courtroom as passengers took the stand to describe the five days adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with very little food, sewage-filled decks and near total darkness at night.

'I think about the smell, the stench and the bad things. All the memories come flooding back, and I can't stop them, testified 74-year-old Jean Cripps, who like the rest of the plaintiffs says the experience left emotional marks that have remained in the year since the headline-grabbing cruise.

'I did not get physically injured. I got mentally injured,' said Cripps, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and whose husband is diabetic. 'The whole experience never ends...It's over and over again.'

According to CNN, U.S. District Judge Donald Graham made a sweeping ruling prior to testimony that Carnival is indeed responsible for the fire that left the cruise helpless and adrift.

'It is highly likely that Carnival was responsible for a reasonably probable causes to which the accident could have be (sic) attributed. Here, the facts of the occurrence warrant the inference of negligence,' Graham wrote.

However, the judge also ruled that the passengers, per their agreements with Carnival, were not guaranteed a safe cruise and therefor the company was not in breach of contract.

Nevertheless, the passengers will 
continue to testify to the extent of their emotional distress and 
injuries for at least another week in an attempt to convince the judge 
they deserve compensation from Carnival.

Those
 include testimonies like the Cripps', who emphasized an extreme fear of
 physical injury during the debacle--not least of all because Alton 
Crisp went without his diabetes medication for days--and other 
passengers' with less tangible but far more stomach-turning flirtations 
with disaster.

Carnival failure? The Carnival Triumph was anything but after a fire knocked out power and left 3,000 passengers without power, with very little food, and fearing for their lives in some cases

Like Fleda Key, who described having terrible diarrhea on the already feces-covered ship and the distinct lack of usable toilets.

'There was lots of urine and feces all the way up to the rim of every one,' said the 68-year-old. '(I) choked away the smell...I was fearful, downright afraid and scared.'

'I walked through water and feces and urine, no telling what else,' Key's daugher Michelle Key agreed on the stand. 'We would slip and slide through greasy, gross, slippery muck.'

Like many of the passengers, the Keys said they feared they wouldn't make it home alive from the trip.

Houston-based plaintiff's attorney Frank Spagnoletti said each passenger should receive anywhere from $30,000 to $1 million in compensation, depending on the severity of their injuries.

'There's documented evidence with regard to any number of plaintiffs that show that they were physically injured, and there is ample documented evidence that shows that all of the plaintiffs were injured mentally because of the way they were exposed to this,' he said in his opening statement.

Miami attorney Curtis Mase, representing Carnival, said the claims of injuries are overblown.

'There are a number who I believe deserve nothing. And I will tell you this, the one or two that I can think of who have significant injuries, they're very much in the minority and there are only one or two,' Mase said.

Steep: The attorney representing the plaintiffs said they're asking for between $30,000 and $1 million for each of the 31 passengers
