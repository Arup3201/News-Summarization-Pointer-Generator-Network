President Obama used a photo-op at a Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters to blame Republicans for shutdown-related furloughs at the agency. But his speech made no mention of the veto threat his administration leveled at FEMA funding just three days ago.

The latest round of saber-rattling on the federal government's partial shutdown came as Washington, D.C. tangled with 45-mph winds and tornado watches, and as midwestern and Gulf of Mexico states recovered from violent weekend storms and threats of devastation from Tropical Storm Karen.

Obama highlighted the government furloughs of hundreds of FEMA employees, including 200 who were called back to work over the weekend – half of whom are likely headed back off the job now that weather cycles have returned to normal.

Angel wings or devil horns? Obama chose to focus on the partial government shutdown's impact on FEMA, despite his administration's threat that he would veto a Republican bill specifically funding the emergency agency

They were 'impacted by 
the current government shutdown' and 'their job has been made more difficult,' the president told FEMA employees, praising them for working under 'less 
than optimal situations.'

'There are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives right now to end this shutdown immediately, with no partisan strings attached,' Obama insisted.

'The House should hold that vote today. If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, then they should prove it. Let the bill go to the floor and let’s see what happens. Just vote.'

But neither the president nor his advisers on the scene addressed a Republican bill that passed Friday
in the House, aimed squarely at restoring FEMA funding. Twenty-three 
Democrats joined all 224 voting Republicans in passing the measure 
247-16.

The administration had announced six hours earlier that if the Senate should
consider and pass the FEMA funding measure separately from a bill 
restoring the rest of government, the president would 
veto it.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, responded to Obama's speech by directing reporters to look at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for answers.

'The bill
passed the House last week and is awaiting action by Senate Democrats,' Buck said. 
'If the president and Washington Democrats want FEMA up and running, they
have the ability to make it happen today.'

Obama spoke about hurricane preparedness at FEMA, but aimed barb after barb at Republicans for supposedly harming the emergency management agency in the partial government shutdown

House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' that there aren't enough disaffected Republicans in his caucus to help Democrats pass an omnibus funding bill in an up-or-down vote

Continuing to fund 
FEMA at 2013 budget levels was part of a GOP-led push to promote a 
series of piecemeal resolutions. Taken together, those resolutions are designed to take noncontroversial 
funding off the table as the White House dug in its heels on negotiating
over funding for the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health 
insurance overhaul law.

'The president,' White house Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday, 'is ready, willing and eager to sit down with lawmakers,' but only on a larger solution that includes funding for all of government – including Obamacare.

Boehner said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' program that if a so-called 'clean' funding resolution were to receive a vote on the House floor, it would fail. At least 18 Republicans would need to defect from their leadership in order to break the logjam, something Boehner insisted would not happen even as the nation approaches its debt ceiling limit.'

'The votes are not in the
House to pass a clean debt limit [increase],' he said. 'And the president is risking default 
by not having a conversation with us.'

A White House official said Monday that Boehner should 'prove that a majority in the House would not vote for the Senate-passed bill to reopen the government by holding an up-or-down vote' on funding for everything, 'including FEMA.'

'Why not vote, right?' Carney jabbed from the White House briefing podium. 'We could resolve this ... if he would simply allow this to come to a vote.'

White House press secretary Jay Carney joined in the elbow-poking on Monday. 'Why not vote, right?' he jabbed. 'Why play these games? Just open the government'

Tropical Storm Karen came with a whimper, not a roar, but president Obama said storm preparations were affected by a scaled-back FEMA in the wake of the government's partial shutdown

'Why play these games? Just open the government,' Carney zinged.

Obama
himself said Monday that 'my very strong suspicion is there are enough 
votes there'' to pass the larger funding legislation that the 
Democratic-controlled Senate favors.

'Hold a vote,' the president dared Republicans. 'Call a vote right now. Let's see what happens.'

But Rep. Tom Graves, a Georgia 
Democrat, said in a Fox News interview after Obama spoke that 
Republicans wouldn't allow the president to pick off its members one by 
one or threaten them into playing the Democrats' game.

'It
would be very dangerous for him to underestimate the resolve of Speaker
Boehner and the unity of the Republican House Conference,' Graves said.

'We are totally unified in protecting the American people and providing them fairness through this process. I hope that's a message the president gets, because we're going to stand firm.'

Graves authored the House bill aimed at defunding Obamacare – the measure that started the shutdown fight last month.

The GOP, he said of Obama, wants 'Americans to have the same delays from the mandate to sign up for Obamacare that he's provided to businesses and members of Congress, and the exemptions for insurance companies. That's all we're asking for.'

Graves added a jab about Obama's FEMA photo-op, saying that 'he really wasn't being forthright with the American people. ... We 
passed a clean FEMA bill just last week and the president ordered a veto
threat against that.'

'He issued the veto threat and ordered Harry Reid not to take it up.'

Louisiana GOP Rep. Steve Scalise said Friday that the Obama administration should put politics aside and allow Republicans to fund FEMA regardless of the impact on larger negotiations.

'When you've got a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, this is not a time for partisanship,' he said.
