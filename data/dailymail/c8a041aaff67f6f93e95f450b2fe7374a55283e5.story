As Andy Murray prepares to take to the court at the Paris Masters and attempt to seal qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals, the British No 1 features in yet another parody movie poster.

Murray has been mocked up as  'A Scottish Tennis-Pro in Paris' in the latest piece of work by designer Nial Smith, with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic also making an appearance.

The poster is a tribute to the 1981 horror comedy film 'An American Werewolf in London'. 

The latest instalment of Nial Smith's series of posters sees Andy Murray, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic feature in a mock-up based on the 'An American Werewolf In London' poster

Andy Murray can seal qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals by reaching the quarter-finals of this week's Paris Masters.

Even if he was to lose his opening match, all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season-ending finale in London:

And it may provide some light relief as he looks to continue with the serious business of booking his place in November's season-ending finale in London.

Murray's comeback from a set down against Tommy Robredo in an enthralling Valencia Open final on Sunday moved him up to fifth in the qualification standings.

The British No 1 only needs to win two matches in Paris and reach the quarter-finals to mathematically guarantee qualification.

But even if he does lose his opening match, it would require an unlikely set of results for him not to qualify for the event on home soil, which begins at the O2 Arena on November 9.

There is plenty at stake in Paris with the world No 1 ranking also up for grabs.

Roger Federer can return to the top of the world rankings for the first time in two years if he wins the title and Novak Djokovic fails to reach the final.

If Djokovic was to suffer a shock defeat before the quarter-finals, then an appearance in the final would also be enough for Federer to overtake the Serb.

World No 3 Rafael Nadal is absent after bringing his season to a close in order to undergo appendix surgery next Monday.
