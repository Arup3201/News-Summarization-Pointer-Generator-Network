The city of Montpellier was once again underwater today after violent storms lashed southern France for the second time in a week.

Hundreds of residents were forced into emergency shelters by the overnight flash floods, which streamed down roads and highways after the River Lez burst its banks.

Roads collapsed as torrents of water upended cars and burst into homes for the second time in seven days, after the region was his last Tuesday by almost 10in of rain in three hours.

The city's Ligue 1 football club was also left counting the cost with the heavy flooding devastating the pitch and stands at its Mosson Stadium.

Officials said the club would be forced to cancel its 40th anniversary party and the next few games may have to be played at an alternative venue.

Around 300 people were forced to stay in a sports gym overnight in the north of the city, The Local reports, while emergency services were stretched to breaking point by dozens of calls.

Sodden: The water in the stadium was high enough to reach the fifth row of seats this morning

Several people had to be rescued by helicopter.

By mid-morning today, around thirty roads were still blocked and the water in the Mosson Stadium was high enough to reach the fifth row of seats, according to RFI.

Last week around 4,000 people had to be taken into emergency centres overnight across the Herault department, as Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve declared a ‘natural disaster’.
