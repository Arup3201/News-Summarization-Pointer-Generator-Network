Controversial: Richard Branson's firm paid police overtime bill for probe into a fraud costing Virgin Media £144 million a year

Scotland Yard was accused of hiring 
out officers for cash yesterday after Richard Branson’s business empire 
paid for police investigating a massive fraud.

The cable television company Virgin 
Media agreed to fund the Metropolitan force’s overtime bill in an 
investigation into a set-box racket costing £144million a year.

The firm paid police £5,060 following
raids which revealed how thousands of viewers were using the boxes to 
view subscription channels without paying.

Virgin Media also agreed to give the 
Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) a quarter of any compensation 
awarded following a successful prosecution.

One of the gang jailed over the 
set-box scam has launched an appeal, alleging that police were 
interested in the case only because of the money a conviction might 
bring in.

The extraordinary deal, at a time of 
unprecedented police budget cuts, has raised wider questions about 
whether the force’s impartiality is compromised in the face of so-called
incentives.

The agreement between Virgin Media 
and the MPA was signed in November 2008 but did not come to light until 
after the conviction of three men for their part in the fraud, which 
involved 400,000 dodgy set-top boxes.

In August 2008, Virgin Media was 
tipped off that a company named Rayyonics was manufacturing and 
importing the devices, sold to suppliers and dealers across the UK.

In September Virgin Media alerted 
police who launched an inquiry, deploying 30 officers who worked 
alongside 18 Virgin investigators.

On November 19, police raids in and 
around east London led to five arrests and the seizure of 5,000 set-top 
boxes and £90,000 in cash.

Virgin Media agreed to give the Metropolitan Police Authority a 'cash donation' of 25 per cent of any compensation awarded following a successful prosecution of the fraud

Six days later, a contract was signed
between a senior Virgin employee and the Met’s commercial partnership 
manager agreeing that Virgin Media would fund the officers’ overtime 
bill as they continued to pursue the inquiry.

It also stated that: ‘It is agreed 
that subject to the following conditions the MPA accepts from the donor 
the unconditional offer of cash donations of 25 per cent of any money 
returned to Virgin Media under a compensation order following asset 
recovery work.’

In April last year, the ringleader, 
Munaf Ahmed Zinga, along with Mukandun Pillai, went on trial at 
Snaresbook Crown Court after attempts to argue that the police payments 
were illegal were dismissed.

Judge Inigo Bing ruled the contract 
including the ‘incentivisation scheme’ was above board and he accepted 
that the financial arrangement had been made after the arrests.

Zinga, 40, was jailed for eight years
and Pillai, 39, six years for conspiracy to defraud. A third man was 
jailed for 12 months after admitting being their delivery driver.

Two other men were cleared. Zinga is appealing against his conviction, arguing that the payments were illegal.

Under the 1996 Police Act, a force may provide ‘special police services’ to ‘any person’ subject to payment.

Although the Virgin deal comes under 
those terms, an MPA member has questioned payments to police by a victim
in an active investigation.

Jenny Jones, a member of the 
authority for 12 years until it was replaced this month by the Mayor’s 
Office for Policing and Crime, said: ‘I have never heard of this. It’s 
like private policing and I am really shocked that somebody thought this
was OK.’

The Metropolitan Police said it could not comment pending Zinga’s legal action.

Virgin Media refused to say how often it had put such contracts in place but said they were used only when appropriate.

It is understood that the company has not yet applied for any compensation in relation to the fraud.
