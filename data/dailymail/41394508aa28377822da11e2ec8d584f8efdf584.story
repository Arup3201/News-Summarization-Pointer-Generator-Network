Patrick Coppeard, 49, a former managing director at Merrill Lynch, conned friends out of more than £5.4million in a Ponzi scam

A retired City banker who cheated churchgoers out of millions in a vast fraud told one victim over the phone: ‘God has told me to give you a ring.’

Over five years Patrick Coppeard collected nearly £5.4million, most of which he blew in online gambling while trying to make up for losses.

When he finally handed himself into police and was asked how much he had left in his account, the former broker for investment bank Merrill Lynch replied: ‘Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.’

The married father of three, a former magistrate, has now been jailed for six years after admitting a single charge of fraud by abuse of position.

He had already moved out of his £1.25million house in Loughton, Essex, and into a more modest home near Harlow. Victims, many left virtually penniless by the scam, complained yesterday that the sentence was ‘pathetic’.

David Jacques, 53, a fellow member of St John’s Church in Buckhurst Hill, said he was phoned by Coppeard two days after selling his house.

‘He told me, “David, you may not believe this but God has asked me to give you a ring”,’ Mr Jacques said. ‘He guaranteed the money himself and offered me 6 per cent interest.’

The power-wash business owner invested £50,000 before ploughing another £283,000 into the bogus scheme.

He added: ‘I’d known him for 20 years from church. I knew he was a financial man and a magistrate so I trusted him. I’m now saddled with a £33,000 credit card debt … I think the sentence is pathetic for what he’s done.’

Another victim, former next-door neighbour Rob Smith, 50, said Coppeard had been one of his closest friends before the ‘immense betrayal’. ‘We thought we were investing into a share trading club and Patrick was handling it on our behalf due to his experience as a stockbroker,’ he said.

The retired business owner added: ‘He had all the credentials – magistrate, church warden, successful stockbroker … That’s why people trusted him.’

Coppeard retired from Merrill Lynch in 2000 due to kidney disease and got into financial trouble after losing £1million of his own money following the banking collapse of 2007.

Many of his victims were parishioners at St John's Church in Buckhurst Hill, Essex - the same church that hosted the funeral of reality TV star Jade Goody in 2009

David Jaques, one of Coppeard's victims, was told that 'God has told me to give you a ring' when he started looking for an investment

In a bid to recover his position he began persuading people to hand over money which he used for spread betting and online gambling.

The huge fraud, known as a Ponzi scheme, ran from January 2008 to May last year and took in the church and 61 individuals, who handed over a total of £5,356,497, of which £3,382,000 was lost.

Coppeard, who resigned as a magistrate last year, managed to keep the scheme afloat by making occasional payouts to some investors.

Days before handing himself in to police, in May last year, he was telling some victims he could double their money in days.

Peter Gair, prosecuting, told Chelmsford Crown Court Coppeard ‘effectively jumped before he was pushed’, adding: ‘In recent weeks and days he was being chased by a number of his victims for payment.’

Victims are likely to receive just 10p for every pound invested when a proceeds of crime hearing takes place next year, the court heard.

Coppeard’s wife, Irene, 53, is understood to be standing by him. Judge Anthony Goldstaub told Coppeard: ‘You attempted to square the circle in a dead market by spread betting and [online] casino gambling. This was always bound to fail – the house having the benefit of the odds.

‘Upon the good work you did and your excellence of character you constructed a web of financial deceit … you trapped a mass of trusting and vulnerable people … [who] believed in you and you brought them to financial ruin.’

Detective Constable John Vickers said: ‘Coppeard preyed on his closest friends and family for his own gain. He has devastated the lives of a considerable number of people.’

A spokesman for St John’s Church said members were ‘distressed’ to see a fellow Christian in such a ‘predicament’.
