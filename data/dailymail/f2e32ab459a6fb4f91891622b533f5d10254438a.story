The memorial also took out the number one spot on the Australian rankings.

The Australian War Memorial is the world's 17th best attraction as judged by TripAdvisor travellers

The memorial beat out other landmarks such as Rio de Janiero's Christ the Redeemer and Sydney Opera House

It drew praise for its in-depth look at the Anzacs' involvement in wars, and its moving and reflective atmosphere.

Traveller Eileen K, from the United Kingdon, said it was 'as splendid as the Taj Mahal'.

'The war memorial is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen,' she wrote.

'I can't find the right words to describe how moving it is.'

Whitsundays' Whitehaven Beach in Queensland was named as fifth best beach in the world

'It does not glorify war, but you feel humbled by the way in which those who died have been remembered.

'The folly of war and the suffering are clearly there for all to see and it was heart-warming to see so many families coming to pay their respects and to educate their children about the bravery and the sacrifice of so many fellow countrymen and women so they can have the life they enjoy today.'

The memorial and the opera house were the only two Australian attractions that made the top 25 list.

As for world destinations, Sydney was the only Australian city or town that made it into the top 25 coming in at 22, and naturally it took out top spot in national rankings as well.

Other Aussie successes on the TripAdvisor lists were Queensland's Whitehaven Beach in the Whitsundays taking out fifth best beach in the world, followed by Exmouth's Turquoise Bay in 20 and Broome's Cable Beach in 22.

Travellers loved Whitehaven's picture perfect views of the ocean.

Noelene R R, from South Africa, said it was 'a bit of heaven' after visiting the beach on a day trip.

'Words cannot describe the feeling you have being a part of this amazing place,' she said.

'The care taken to keep it pristine is commendable too and I cried when we left, such was the impact of visiting this fabulous place.'

AlistarHawkwind said it was an 'unspoilt beauty' and it lived up to its namesake

'This is quite simply the most beautiful place I've ever seen, twice, ' he said.

'The sand is the purest silica in the the world, and white, white, white. Feels like fine flour.'
