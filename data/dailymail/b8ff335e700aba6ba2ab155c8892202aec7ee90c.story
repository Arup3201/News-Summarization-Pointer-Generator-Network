A man who shot dead his wife before posting grisly photos of her corpse on Facebook may use Florida's 'stand your ground' defense, with new photos taken after the shoot-out showing bruises on his arm.

Derek Medina, 31, claimed he shot Jennifer Alfonso, 26, after she viciously attacked him at their South Miami home on August 8. He then posted a picture of her dead body online to notify family members.

Now Medina's attorney said his client may use Florida's 'stand your ground' self-defense law, with new photos taken eight days after the shooting showing small bruises on his arm.

Self-defense: Photos taken eight days after the shooting show yellow bruises on Derek Medina's arm, which he claims proves he acted in self-defense

Victim? Derek Medina claims he killed his wife only after years of violence and abuse

These photos show a shirtless Medina with small, yellow-colored bruises on his arm

The photos  from the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office show a shirtless Medina with small, yellow-colored bruises on his upper-left arm, but no other noticeable injuries, WPLG reported.

A court last week denied Medina's request for bail. He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder with a firearm.

Medina's attorney, Saam Zanganeh, told the court his client may have feared bodily harm, even without having life threatening injuries.

He said Florida's 'stand your ground' self-defense law and the Castle Doctrine, which permits force to be met with force inside a person's home, could apply in his client's case.

'She's the aggressor,' Zanganeh said, according to WPLG, during closing arguments. 'Her level of anger and distress and stewing in her own venom, it didn't get better, it got worse.'

Prosecutors have also released a chilling 911 call made on the day of the shooting from the Gables Club Condominiums, where Medina worked.

'He (Medina) just shot his girlfriend 16 times, and he's on his way to the police department,' the caller - reportedly Medina's boss - said, according to audio broadcast by NBC Miami.

'He just said that it was too many years of abuse, and she started to hit him and I guess he snapped and shot her.'

'I need just a follow up that he is in 
custody. If this guy has lost his marbles, I don't want him coming here 
and going postal, you know what I mean?

Medina later turned himself into a South Miami police station.

While Medina has maintained he acted in self-defense, a police detective testifying on Tuesday said Alfonso was likely cowering and trying to defend herself
before she was killed.

In
his hearing testimony, Detective Jonathan Grossman said an autopsy and 
the position of Alonso's body indicates she was on her knees with one 
arm raised in front of her face when she was shot on during an 
argument.  

The trajectories of the 380-caliber bullets indicate they were fired from above her, he added.

'The
victim was very low to the ground at the time she was shot,' Grossman 
testified. 'The victim appeared to be in a cowering position.'

Grossman also said friends and family members told him that Medina had vowed to kill his wife if she ever cheated on him or attempted to leave him.

Medina himself told police in his sworn statement that Alonso had threatened to leave that day and that she had told a friend the same thing earlier.

The testimony came at a bail hearing for Medina, who sat silently in the courtroom wearing a red jail jumpsuit and a full, dark beard.

Medina's attorney, Zanganeh, brought up several pieces of evidence indicating that Alonso could have been the aggressor in their fight.

Medina claimed that he killed his wife in self-defense after she threatened him with a knife, following many previous abusive episodes

Her diary, which she titled 'The Diary of the Insane Women,' had several violence-laced entries, including one in which she said she thought about ripping Medina's eyes out because he looked at other women.

'The diary chronicles her thoughts and buttresses our position that she had violent thoughts against Mr. Medina,' Zanganeh said.

Grossman testified under cross-examination that police had no previous domestic violence reports from the home.

But he also said Medina had trained briefly at a mixed martial arts center and had boxed with the center's veteran instructor after challenging him.

Assistant State Attorney J. Scott Dunn asked the detective whether, with Medina's apparent fighting abilities, it seemed plausible that he feared violence from his wife enough to fatally shoot her in self-defense.

'That's what he indicated. According to his statement, she was punching him,' Grossman replied.
