A Domino's Pizza worker was caught on camera buying 59p bags of potato wedges from a nearby Aldi supermarket after the takeaway branch ran out of the side orders it sells for £3.49.

Dressed in his Domino's uniform, the staff member was photographed at the checkout buying bags of the frozen snacks.

The chain's shop in Linlithgow, West Lothian, then passed off the Aldi wedges as it's Bakin' Hot Potato Wedges, which are normally sold at £3.49 per portion - a difference in price of £2.90 from the Aldi version.

When first confronted about the claims, embarrassed staff initially claimed the food was for personal use.

However, pizza bosses then admitted that 
wedges were sometimes purchased from the nearby supermarket, before 
insisting customers normally get 'Domino's wedges'.

Shopper Tom Sneddon, who lives near the branch, spotted the Domino's worker as he queued at the Aldi checkout.

'I am a regular customer of Domino's Pizza and was surprised to see a staff member buying potato wedges from Aldi,' he said.

'Whilst I had a bit of a chuckle, it is also really cheeky flogging Aldi products as their own.'

A spokesman for Domino's said that high demand due to the World Cup and Wimbledon caused the branch's shortage of wedges.

Short trip: The Domino's branch is just a short walk from the Aldi supermarket where the wedges were bought

'Very occasionally stores are in an unfortunate situation where some products may run out,' he said.

'With big sporting events in full swing the Linlithgow store was faced with no wedges.

'We do not advocate this as a solution and we have spoken to them to ensure ordering has been adjusted to fully cover this busy period and our customers get Domino's wedges.'
