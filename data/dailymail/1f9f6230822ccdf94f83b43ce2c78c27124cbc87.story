The Nichol family had never been on holiday to Turkey before, nor had we previously experienced an all inclusive package. 

So as my wife Suzie, nine-year-old daughter Sophie and I arrived at the Marti Myra resort on the Mediterranean coast, the place was facing a tough test.

First impressions were good. The reception area was plush and polished, with acres of wood, glass and marble.

To Sophie's delight, plenty of kids were lounging around on giant sofas availing themselves of free wi-fi and watching giant TVs. 

As the adults sipped cocktails at the lobby bar, the hotel appeared bustling but by no means overcrowded - probably because Marti Myra is a huge, rambling resort with seemingly endless facilities.

All 551 rooms were taken when we stayed, housing around 1,100 adults and 500 children. But there was never any sense we were competing for space. 

This may well be because the site is set in 100 acres, has seven pools, water slides, beaches, an amphitheatre, five bars and seven restaurants. 

Sophie quickly made friends with other British children and more or less disappeared for the fortnight.

This is a resort completely geared towards family satisfaction and we were totally happy for the children to play in the pools, visit the various restaurants and go to the arcade unsupervised. 

That said, I suspect the amount of vegetables consumed at their private lunches was in inverse proportion to the volume of ice-cream eaten. 

If that was the case they were missing out, as the food was tremendous - endless buffets of fresh fish, salads, grilled meats - and 20 desserts. For a small supplement, guests can also choose from à la carte restaurants.

Marti Myra is in the Kemer region, which is dominated by the towering presence of Mount Tahtali, the highest peak in southern Turkey.

It demands a visit so we took the cable car to the 7,757ft summit. At €210 (around £150) for the three of us, it wasn't cheap but it was worth it to experience the glorious panorama.

The pool complex at Marti Myra was a hit with the Nichols family

In true Nichol-clan style, this was our only excursion from the resort as we were more than happy to luxuriate on the beach or by the pool.

The only other added extra we chose to invest in was one of the £100-a-day pavilions on the pristine beach. 

These private retreats came equipped with robes, sofas, sunbeds and a fridge. And if you couldn't be bothered to open the fridge door yourself, a waiter would bring over drinks and snacks.

We could have taken part in all sorts of activities, from aqua-aerobics to archery, dancing and poolside It's A Knockout-style games. The beach party was a riot of noise, while the nightly entertainment included amazing Kenyan acrobats.

The Kids' Club production of Grease had Suzie and I doing the full John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John routine... much to Sophie's utter horror. 

For a more peaceful break you can simply retreat to the calm of the rolling gardens. 

Marti Myra really did offer a fabulous holiday experience for the whole family. 

Sophie was happy - and if children are happy, contentment for all will surely follow.
