Standing empty on an icy mountainside, this abandoned ski lodge is being reclaimed by the frozen environment it was built to serve.

Built 691 metres above sea level in 1967, the lodge has been left open to the frosty elements since it was left to ruin six years ago.

In winter ice forces its way through smashed windows and snow piles up against the exterior walls, recalling the unforgettable image of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining.

Room with a view: A large function room in the abandoned ski lodge in Norway now full of snow

Bislingen mountain lodge in Norway was once a popular destination for fashionable skiers in the 1970s.

In its twilight years the lodge, an hour away from Oslo, still ran as a small cafe. The cafe eventually closed in 2008 and the mountain retreat has been empty ever since.

Photographer Svein Nordrum, 54, trekked up the mountain to visit the deserted building when temperatures in the area plummeted to -7C.

Mr Nordrum said: 'The lodge was full of ice and full of snow. I really had to watch my step. It is quite a strange place and bitterly cold as well.'

An abandoned ski rental service, still stocked with ski boots and equipment dating to the 1980s is attached to the lodge.

Mr Nordrum said: 'What's left is a very strange empty building. The mountain seems to be taking it over. The whole place is slowly filling up with snow.'

There are plans to renovate the mountain lodge and convert it into a 40-metre-tall hotel.

Mr Nordrum said: 'There are mixed feeling about the redevelopment - some think it will spoil the landscape. I think it would be good to make this beautiful place a popular retreat again.'
