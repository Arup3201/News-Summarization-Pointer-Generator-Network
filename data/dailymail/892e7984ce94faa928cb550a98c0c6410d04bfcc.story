Carles Gil's proposed £3.25million move to Aston Villa has hit a late snag over agent fees.

Paul Lambert had hoped to unveil the attacking midfielder on Tuesday afternoon but has been forced to postpone an announcement as the final details are ironed out.

The club are still confident a deal will be done but must wait until this unforeseen development is concluded before providing confirmation.

A five-year contract has been agreed with the player, but agent fees represent the final hurdle.

Villa have only scored 11 goals in 21 Premier League games this season and were booed off in their 1-0 defeat to bottom club Leicester on Saturday.

Lambert wants Gil, 22, who has represented Spain at Under-21 level, to provide VIlla with the cutting edge that has been so desperately lacking for his side in recent weeks.

Should the deal go through, Gil will be reunited with Villa's Colombian defensive midfielder Carlos Sanchez with whom he played while on loan at Elche last season.
