Police have launched an investigation into alleged homophobic remarks on Twitter which were directed towards rugby referee Nigel Owens, they said.

The comments were posted after he refereed the England v France international at Twickenham on Saturday, Dyfed-Powys Police said.

The force said in a statement: 'This follows a number of complaints made by members of the public. The tweet concerned has now been removed from the page. The investigation is at an early stage.'

England scored seven tries in beating France 55-35 in a dramatic contest, but were unable to overturn a pre-match 26-point deficit as Ireland clinched the RBS 6 Nations title on points difference.
