A long-awaited rescue of passengers on board a research ship trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week was today successfully completed.

A helicopter airlifted passengers to a nearby vessel after landing on a makeshift helipad next to the stranded ship.

The helicopter was originally going to fly the passengers to a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, with a barge then ferrying them to a nearby Australian vessel.

But sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the Snow Dragon, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre, which is overseeing the rescue, said the operation would consequently be delayed.

The end is in sight: The first of the 52 passengers on a research ship trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week were finally rescued by helicopter after several aborted attempts to evacuate them

The helicopter carried the passengers a dozen at a time over approximately five hours

Sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, so the passengers are instead being taken to an nice floe next to an Australian vessel which will eventually take them to Tasmania

A last-minute change in plans allowed the rescue to go ahead.

The
 52 scientists and tourists on board were instead flown to an ice 
floe next to the Australian icebreaker the Aurora Australis, and then 
taken by a small boat to the Australian ship, expedition leader Chris 
Turney said.

The first group safely lifted off Thursday evening, he said.

'I
 think everyone is relieved and excited to be going on to the Australian
 icebreaker and then home,' Mr Turney told The Associated Press by 
satellite phone from the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalski, which has 
been stuck in the ice since Christmas Eve.

Mr Turney had earlier posted video of the helicopter's arrival on his 
Twitter account, writing: 'The Chinese helicopter has arrived (at) the 
Shokalskiy. It's 100% we're off! A huge thanks to all.'

He then uploaded a video showing the first of the passengers making their
 way on board the helicopter, saying: 'The first of the helicopters to 
take us home. Thanks everyone!'

The helicopter carried the passengers a dozen at a time. All 22 crew members stayed with their icebound vessel, which is not in danger.

The Aurora will carry the passengers to the Australian island state of Tasmania, arriving by mid-January.

The
 long-awaited rescue came after days of failed attempts to get the 
passengers off the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy, which got stuck 
on Christmas Eve.

Blinding snow, strong winds, fog and thick sea ice forced rescuers to turn back time and again.

Three
 icebreakers were initially dispatched to try and crack their way 
through the thick ice surrounding the ship, but all failed. Â

The
 Aurora came within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the ship Monday, but 
fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water.

The
 Akademik Shokalskiy, which left New Zealand on Nov. 28, got stuck 
Christmas Eve after a blizzard pushed the sea ice around the ship, 
freezing it in place about 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) south of 
Hobart, Tasmania.

The ship isn't in danger of sinking and has weeks' worth of supplies on board, but it cannot move.

The
 scientific team on board had been recreating Australian explorer 
Douglas Mawson's 1911 to 1913 voyage to Antarctica. Turney had hoped to 
continue the trip if an icebreaker managed to free the ship.
