For committed fans of retro photography apps such as Instagram, it could be the ultimate way to continue the retro theme.

A London firm has created a Â£10 ($15) micro-sized projector that can display instagram pictures on a nearby wall.

The Projecteo project has become a huge hit online - reaching its funding target on the Kickstarter site in less than 24 hours.

The projecto is a tiny replica of a slide projector that can display instagram pictures printed onto film

'Projecteo is a tiny Instagram projector,' the site says.

'It uses wheels of 35mm slide film you make online and each one holds nine photos.

'Whether they're of your best friends, that holiday last summer or good old pictures of cats, just pop them into Projecteo, focus by twisting the lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow.'

Benjamin Redford of London Agency Mint, which created the product, said he was amazed by the response.

'It's been wicked,' he said.

'We hit our funding target in under 24 hours, and the response has been incredible.'

The projector is a fully working system that uses pictures printed onto Kodak film instead of traditional slides

Inside the projector is a single LED light which projects the image when focused

The firm says the projector works exactly like a normal sized one.

'Like all projectors, Projecteo works best in the dark,' they say.

'We've had great looking images up to two and a half feet wide in a pitch black room.

'Unlike screens, slide film doesn't have pixels.

'This means you get beautiful looking images from a device the size of a matchbox.'

The projector is designed to look like a retro slide proctor, complete with slide carousel

The images are first chosen on an app, which send the order to Mint.

The pictures are printed on Kodak film, with each frame being a mini slide carousel

Each carousel is then cut and placed in a special tiny holder which is placed in the projector
