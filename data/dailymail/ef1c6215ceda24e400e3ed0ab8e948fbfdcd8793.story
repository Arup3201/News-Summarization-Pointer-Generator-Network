L'Wren Scott's sister has lashed out at Sir Mick Jagger after the singer was photographed on the balcony of his hotel room in Zurich last weekend with a mystery brunette decades his junior.

The Rolling Stones front man was seen spending time with the woman just 11 weeks since the fashion designer committed suicide.

Jan Shane, 53, said: 'And people wonder why L'Wren was so depressed?'

While the rock star is said to have been left ‘devastated and distraught’ after his 49-year-old lover of 13 years was found hanged in her New York apartment on March 17, Shane says Mick 'will never change' his ways.

'These pictures make me really wonder what Mick is thinking and feeling. His daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about losing my sister,' she told The Mirror.

'And then you see these photos he will never change.'

Meanwhile, friends say the rock star has been ‘drowning his sorrows’ with women since the suicide of his Scott.

A friend said over the weekend: ‘Some men drown their sorrow in drink. Mick doesn’t drink much but he drowns his sorrows in women.’

They said that the mystery brunette in Zurich was not the first woman Mick has spent time with since the death of his girlfriend.

‘Through good times and bad, the thing that never changes is Mick’s love for women. Sex is like a coping mechanism for him.’

And a close friend admitted: ‘He grieved hard but Mick is someone who has always loved life and loves women. This is just Mick being Mick and moving on the only way he knows how.’

According to reports, Sir Mick spent two days with the woman after meeting her in a Zurich nightclub following a Rolling Stones gig.

As well as being pictured shirtless on the balcony of his hotel penthouse, he was also seen being embraced by the woman, who appeared to be wearing one of his shirts.

A source said Sir Mick had deliberately posed on the balcony ‘to show he’s back in business’. ‘He doesn’t do anything by accident,’ the source added. ‘He will have known photographers were watching. It was just nice to see Mick smiling again.’

Last night, L’Wren’s sister Jan Shane – who was estranged from the fashion designer at the time of her death – said: ‘These pictures make me wonder what Mick is really thinking and feeling.

‘His daughter says that he is heartbroken and devastated about losing my sister, and then you see these photos. He’ll never change.’

L’Wren is said to have killed herself after falling heavily into debt. In a statement in March, Sir Mick said  he ‘failed to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way’.
