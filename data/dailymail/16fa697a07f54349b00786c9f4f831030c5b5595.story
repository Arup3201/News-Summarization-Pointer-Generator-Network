The world's most expensive player put his feet up at home as he watched Real Madrid deliver a brutal first-half lesson to Liverpool.

Gareth Bale was forced to miss the Champions League holder's visit to Anfield as he recuperates from a gluetal buttock injury.

The £85million former Tottenham winger will not take part in this Saturday's El Clasico showdown with arch-rivals Barcelona either as he battles to return to full fitness.

But he was pleased to see his Madrid team-mates excel without him as they surged into a 3-0 lead before half-time on Merseyside, courtesy of goals by Cristiano Ronaldo and a brace by Karim Benzema.

Bale posted a picture of himself on Twitter watching the game with his feet up at home and wrote: 'Gutted not to be there, it's been a great first 45!! Got to keep it up for the second half #HalaMadrid.'

Despite Real's sensational performance, manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted before the game that they were missing the Welshman.

'Gareth Bale is very important for us because he has a fantastic quality in every sense,' Ancelotti said, speaking to Sky Sports.

'We have to replace him. We have a fantastic squad so we have to replace him.

'You lose things in both attack and defence with Gareth.'

His absence was at least one positive for Liverpool who managed to keep the scoreline the same after the interval. Imagine what it might have been with Bale on the pitch...
