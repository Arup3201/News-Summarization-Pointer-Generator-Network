As Brits abroad, our reputation often precedes us. However, according to a new research, that's not necessarily a bad thing any more.

British holidaymakers are more polite, better behaved and more generous than they were three years ago, claims a survey of 500 hotel workers from across the world.

Tipping, general behaviour and politeness emerged as the most improved factors in holidaymakers' attitudes. 

Best behaviour: British holidaymakers are more polite, better behaved and more generous than they were

The survey also found 21 per cent of staff thought the Dutch the most pleasant to deal with on holiday. 

Brit tourists were next with 16 per cent, followed by the Germans (13 per cent), the Spanish (11 per cent) and the Irish (eight per cent). 

Those taking part in the Sunshine.co.uk survey were asked to  compare their interactions and opinions of UK tourists today to their experiences from three years ago.

More than half of hotel staff (65 per cent) found that Britons were more generous with their tips - although 18 per cent said they were less generous than in 2011, whilst 17 per cent did not see any change.

Despite politeness, tipping and behaviour improving 52% said Britons drink in excess when on their holidays

More than half of hotel staff (65%) said that British tourists were more generous with their tips

A 54 per cent majority also said British holidaymakers were more polite than they were three years ago but 35 per cent thought there was no change while 11 per cent considered Brits to be 'less polite' than they were before.

Overall 71 per cent of those polled found that the general behaviour of Britons had improved while 12 per cent said they hadn't seen a difference.

Seventeen per cent claimed that British holidaymakers were becoming more badly behaved.

Despite politeness, tipping generosity and general behaviour having improved according to the majority of the hotel workers, the research revealed that the majority (52 per cent) felt that Britons were 'drinking in excess' when on holiday.

Hotel workers from popular tourism territories including the Canary Islands, mainland Spain, France, Turkey, Greece, Portugal, Mexico, Italy, Egypt and the Balearic Islands took part in the poll

Five hundred hotel workers from popular tourism holiday resorts including the Canary Islands, mainland Spain, France, Turkey, Greece, Portugal, Mexico, Italy, Egypt and the Balearic Islands took part in the poll. 

All staff taking part had been at the same resort for at least three years.

Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: 'It's great that holidaymakers from the UK are finally getting a better reputation abroad. For too long, we've been known for our overly patriotic outfits, our stingy tips and 24-hour drinking culture. 

'Perhaps we're still known for our ability to put away ten pints before lunch, but at least hotel staff around the world have noticed a change and people are being more courteous!'
