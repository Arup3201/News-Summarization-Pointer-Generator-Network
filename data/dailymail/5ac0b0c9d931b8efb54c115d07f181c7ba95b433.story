Moeen Ali says he is ready to take on Australia’s two left-arm Mitchells in the Ashes – and has overcome the problems he had against the short ball during his introduction to Test cricket last summer.

Moeen is planning to join up with the England squad ahead of the second Test in the Caribbean, starting in Grenada on April 21 – having recovered more quickly from a rib injury than anyone expected.

And he intends to put to good use the experience gained during the World Cup, where he averaged 38 with a strike-rate of 105 – one of the few glimmers of light in an otherwise benighted tournament for England.

Moeen's performance in the World Cup was a glimmer of light in a disappointing tournament for England

When the Ashes get going on July 8 Australia will undoubtedly bombard Moeen with bouncers after he found a variety of ways to get out to the short ball against Sri Lanka and India last year – with Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc ready to unleash merry hell.

But Moeen, who was recently named one of Wisden’s Five Cricketers of the Year, said: ‘It was something I was working on at the World Cup in Australia. And now I’ve tasted a bit of Johnson and Starc and these guys, I feel I’m much more ready than I was last year. It was good for me to see that I can handle that kind of bowling.

‘I probably thought about the short ball too much in the end, and forgot about the rest of my batting. So I’ve learned from that now, and hopefully I won’t ever do that again.’

And for those who have not yet erased from their memories Johnson’s demolition job on England’s batsmen during the 5-0 Ashes whitewash in 2013-14, Moeen has some cautionary words.

‘I think Starc is quicker than Johnson,’ he said. ‘I think he’ll be more dangerous than him because of the swing. But let’s see what happens. I’ve only faced Johnson once, and that was his first game back, so maybe he’s a bit quicker now.’

Moeen, who hopes to play for Worcestershire against Yorkshire on Sunday in the opening round of County Championship matches, wants to establish himself as the Test team’s No 1 spinner.

Nineteen wickets at 23 against India last summer was a good start. And he has been working on his doosra, which was briefly unveiled against Sri Lanka at Headingley a year ago, but has remained under wraps during the ICC’s recent purge against dodgy bowling actions.

‘I feel like I’m bowling it quite well,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t right at the time, but now that I feel like I’ve got it right. But a lot of players got banned, so I’ve got to err on the careful side of things. I think in the future I’d definitely like to bowl it.

‘I feel like I’m part of the team now. But I don’t take anything for granted. I still play every game like it’s my first and my last game. I’m looking forward to going out to the West Indies and performing.’
