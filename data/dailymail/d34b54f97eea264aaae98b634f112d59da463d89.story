A second family with a child under the age of 12 has joined in the fight to change the organ transplant policies for children in the United States.

Milagros Martinez, whose son Javier Acosta, 11, is suffering from cystic fibrosis and is in dire need of a lung transplant, has filed a suit urging public policymakers to change the rules for organ transplants.

The Organ Transplant and Procurement Network's policy currently states that sick children under the age of 12 are automatically placed at the bottom of the transplant list, regardless of the severity of their disease.

Javier Acosta, 11, pictured here, is suffering from cystic fibrosis and in need of a lung transplant. His mother filed a lawsuit to change the organ transplant policy in the U.S. to allow children equal placement on the adult transplant list

Martinez is asking the policy be changed so that children under 12 are placed on the list according to the severity of their condition.

Currently children are placed at the bottom of the adult list and are eligible to receive children's organs, but those are rare to come by.

According to Martinez's suit, 'The pool of lungs donated from adults is more than 50 times larger than the pool of lungs donated from children.'

She hopes that adopting this new policy would give her son and children like him more of a fighting chance.

'Javier is severely ill and if he does not receive a donated set of lungs very soon he will die,' the lawsuit says. 'Without one he will most likely die before his 12th birthday in August.'

Martinez's first son, Jovan, died at 11 from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease, according to the suit, while waiting for a transplant.

Martinez's suit comes after a similar cry for policy change from the family of Sarah Murnaghan, 10, who is also suffering from cystic fibrosis.

The parents of Sarah Murnaghan, 10, (pictured here with their sick child) who is in need of a lung transplant, are urging policymakers to allow chidren to receive due consideration on the adult transplant list

The Murnaghan's efforts spurned a nation-wide debate over organ transplant policy, and even caused some lawmakers to call upon U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to intervene, NBC 10 Philadelphia reported.

Stephen Harvey, the lawyer representing both family's whose children are waiting for a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told NBC, 'We're seeking that the system allocate a lung to Javier based on the severity of his condition.'

'So if there's an adult who's more severe than him, that adult gets the lung. We're not asking to jump to the front of the line.'

Harvey said that right now there are 16 children, ages 5 to 10, currently in need of lung transplants across the country who have all been allocated to the bottom of the waiting list.

Though no policy changes have been seen yet, last week U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ruled in favor of the two families, granting them a temporary court order until June 14 that prevents the children from being kept at the bottom of the transplant list.

However, this is not a lasting solution, and the executive committee of the Organ Transplant Network is scheduled to meet on Monday to officially review that rules.

Yet, not everyone is in favor of a policy change. Many critics of this policy shift cite a fear that adding young children to the transplant list will just push deserving older patients further down it, Reuters reported.

Whatever the outcome of this national debate, one person who might not have time to wait to see it is 11-year old Javier.

'We're not trying to skip ahead of anyone,' his mother said during a press conference. 'We just want him to have a fighting chance.'
