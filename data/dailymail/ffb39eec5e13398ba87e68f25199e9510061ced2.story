Still rocking: Mick Jagger, seen performing in Los Angeles in April, mused about what could have been

He drove teenage girls wild, sold millions of albums and fronts one of the world's most popular bands.

But it would seem that Sir Mick Jagger can't get no Satisfaction - and wishes he could have had a 'gratifying' tole as a teacher, instead of the 'intellectually undemanding' life of a rocker.

The Rolling Stone frontman, who has earned millions from his singing career, says that the life of a teacher, journalist or politician would have been a worthy way of earning a living.

In an interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, the veteran rocker said he had considered a career as a dancer but was put off by the prospect of 'so many injuries'.

Jagger, who was still a student at the London School of Economics when the Stones were starting out in the Sixties, told John Humphrys: 'A schoolteacher would have been very gratifying, I'm sure.

'Everyone wants to have done more things in their lives.

'It is a slightly intellectually undemanding thing to do, being a rock singer, but, you know, you make the best of it.'

The 69-year-old OBE mused about his lengthy career as he and his band prepared to perform at Glastonbury this weekend.

Life could have been very different for 
the father-of-seven if he had pursued a more academic career.

He began playing gigs in London in 1962 and is 
estimated to have sold more than 200million albums.

The musician, from Dartford, Kent, attended grammar school and said there were a 'million things' he would have liked to have pursued.

He said in the interview: 'All these things you think of when you're a teenager, you can think, well, I would have liked to have done that but that's completely pointless but I don't feel frustrated for a lack of control at all and I'm very pleased with what I've done,' The Telegraph reported.

But despite sacrificing a more challenging role in life, it would appear that the rocker is still studious when it comes to his art.

The Rolling Stones may be one of the biggest acts in the world but Jagger still took his preparations for the Glastonbury festival extremely seriously.

The singer studied DVDs of performances of the festival going back over the last four years to prepare for the bandâ€™s much-awaited headlining slot this weekend.

Jagger wants to make sure the Stones master the famous Pyramid Stage on what will be, amazingly, their festival debut at Worthy Farm tonight.

Jagger will join bandmates Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Wattsto perform tracks from the group's 50-year career.

The Stones have been rehearsing up to 'eight or nine hours a day' ahead of their performance.
