A Conservative MP ignored Foreign Office advice on travelling to Ecuador and paid the price – she had her purse stolen after a thief slashed her rucksack.

Tracey Crouch, the MP for Chatham and Aylesford in Kent, flew out to the Latin American country - notorious for muggings and pickpockets - on Tuesday this week to take part in a charity climb up the 19,347ft-high Cotapaxi volcano to raise cash for the Royal British Legion and Help for Heroes.

On her first day Miss Crouch went for a stroll in in the old town of the capital city Quito, rucksack on her back and a local thief relieved her of her purse.

Miss Crouch ignored security advice to avoid the old town and to wear her rucksack on her front.

She tweeted: ‘First day in Ecuador ruined by someone slashing my rucksack with knife & stealing purse. Not a good start’ adding on her blog: ‘We started day with an hour stroll from hotel to British Embassy where the Ambassador was kind enough to meet us all and give us an insight into Ecuador, their political and military structures and how Britain trades with them.

‘Afterwards we went to the charming Old Town where unfortunately my rucksack was slashed and my purse was taken, without me or anyone in the group noticing.

‘Am trying to put a brave face on but am now without rucksack and credit cards for rest of trip!’

Miss Crouch is in Ecuador with six injured soldiers and fellow MPs John Mann (Lab) and Greg Mulholland (Lib Dem). They are due to start the climb next week.

Muggings and pick pocketing are common. In Quito, take particular care in ‘La Carolina’ and ‘El Ejido’ parks, the districts of ‘La Mariscal’, ‘La Floresta’ and ‘La Marin’, the old town including the central bus station, and ‘El Panecillo’ hill.

Don’t wear expensive jewellery when walking around and watch your bags on public transport. Wear your rucksack on the front of your body. Where possible, don’t store anything under your seat or in the overhead storage. Keep your passport and money on you at all times. Take care of your belongings in restaurants or cafes and watch out for thieves. Criminals sometimes squirt liquids (ketchup, mustard, water, etc.) on you and then steal your bag while ‘helping’ to clean you up. Other methods of distraction include requests for assistance, staged fights and pushing or shoving. Don’t resist a robbery.

Armed robbery is a constant hazard throughout Ecuador, but especially in Quito, Guayaquil and in remote areas. A British national was shot dead in February 2009 in Pedernales, in Manabi province, while undertaking conservation work.

The FCO advise against all but essential travel to several parts of the country. Road conditions are variable. Heavy rains and mudslides often close or wash away roads, which can cause significant delays and accidents.Serious accidents are very common, mainly due to careless driving, speeding and badly maintained vehicles. Ecuador has one of the highest rates of road accidents in Latin America.
