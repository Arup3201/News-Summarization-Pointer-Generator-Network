Germany opened the door for Britain to claw back powers from Brussels yesterday as David Cameron received the red carpet treatment from Angela Merkel.

Berlin is prepared to negotiate over whether some issues can be decided by member states rather than the EU, one of her allies said.

Michael Meister, a leading member of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, said Germany was ‘open for arguments’ about returning some powers.

It was a marked change of tone from the 
German government, which in recent weeks has sought to downplay the 
prospects of any renegotiation of Britain’s terms of EU membership.

It came as Mr Cameron, wife Samantha and their three children spent the night at Schloss Meseberg, the German Chancellor’s official country retreat.

Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel held talks about the future of Europe, with the Prime Minister making the case for more reforms.

The invitation was a boost for Mr 
Cameron, who has called for Britain to negotiate a new deal with the EU 
and then hold an in-out referendum on the package by 2017.

Mr Meister indicated that Mrs Merkel is prepared to give some ground on British demands for reform because she is keen for the UK to stay in the EU. He also indicated that Berlin could countenance the end of the EU-wide working time directive and the return of working hours laws to Westminster.

Mr Meister said Germany acknowledges the need to examine which powers are held in Brussels and which should not be.

‘In some cases we need common 
solutions,’ he said. ‘We need intensive discussion and we need to see 
what could go on European level and what could stay at the national 
level.’ He confirmed that Berlin is keen to keep Britain as a key ally 
against the protectionist, anti-capitalist economic policies of some 
southern European nations.

‘I think there are a lot of common ideas with the British side and the German side on it,’ he said.

Earlier this week, Mr Cameron said 
British voters’ support for EU membership was ‘wafer-thin’ and that the 
EU ‘sometimes overreached itself with directives and interventions and 
interference’. He stressed the need for a ‘more flexible Europe’.

Andrea Leadsom, of the Fresh Start 
Group which wants to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU, 
said Mr Cameron will seek a deal. ‘I don’t think anybody on the 
backbenches or the frontbenches of any party thinks laying down the law 
is at all possible or plausible or desirable,’ she said.

‘The Foreign Office have not 
traditionally been incredibly brave or ambitious in negotiations. I 
think David Cameron has been and will continue to be, so I think we are 
in a very good place.’

But 
Labour foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said the Prime 
Minister’s trip ‘simply confirms that months after his speech on Europe 
he remains marooned between what Conservative backbenchers demand and 
what European leaders will accept’.
