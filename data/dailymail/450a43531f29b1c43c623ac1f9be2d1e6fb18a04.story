Thomson Airways also announced flights would have duo seating for couples and include a wine cooler

Changes will also include extra legroom and a ‘kids club’ with trained crew on-board to keep children entertained with arts, crafts and quizzes.

From next year the airline will fly to and from extra destinations including Costa Rica, Malaysia and Vietnam.

There will also be the option to fly to Caribbean islands such as Curacao, Bonaire, Antigua and St Lucia.

While on-board meals are likely to be related to the holiday destination, flights will have a beach snack bar where passengers can socialise.

Thomson will also employ a ‘dedicated holidaymaker’ to give advice to passengers and crew members will be equipped with iPads to provide destination information and pass special requests to the resort team.

The in-flight entertainment system will also include an on-screen resort welcome, hotel and destination guides.

New channels will be designed specifically for holidaymakers including a bedtime story channel for children and bespoke teenage content.

David Burling, managing director of TUI UK & Ireland, the travel group which owns Thomson, said: 'Our airline business has traditionally been categorised in the charter sector which is often perceived as the poor relation to scheduled and, in reality, bears little resemblance to the Thomson Airways experience today.

'Our overall goal is to make travel experiences special and, as the flight marks both the start and end of the holiday, we see it as an integral part of the whole holiday experience.

The in-flight entertainment will have content and channels designed specifically for holidaymakers including a bedtime story channel for children, bespoke teenage content and destination inspiration channels on long-haul

'That is why we want to want to define and lead a new category of flying – the holiday airline category. This describes an airline designed for the specific needs of the holiday maker and fully connected to the holiday experience in the destination.

'We’ll achieve this by continuing to invest in our fleet, in state-of-the-art aircraft like the 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX, in our on-board technology connecting the flight experience to that in resort and in product and service innovations that are entirely relevant to the holidaymaker both today and tomorrow.' 

From next year the airline will fly to new destinations including Costa Rica, St Lucia, Vietnam and Malaysia

Thomson will introduce a fleet of 47 new Boeing 737 MAX jets by 2020 as part of branding as ‘holiday airline’
