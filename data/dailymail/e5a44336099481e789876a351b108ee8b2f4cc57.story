Victim: The body of Corporal Geoffrey McNeill, 32, was discovered at Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, Shropshire. Another soldier has been arrested on suspicion of murder

A soldier has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an Army corporal at their barracks just hours after a reported late night brawl in a nearby town centre.

The body of Corporal Geoffrey McNeill, 32, was discovered at Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, Shropshire, at around 9am on Saturday.

A 23-year-old soldier, who served at the same barracks near Market Drayton, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and was being questioned by detectives at Shrewsbury police station today.

Speaking on behalf of the victim's family, one of his three brothers, Jason McNeill paid tribute to the soldier.

'Geoff was born in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, and dedicated his life to the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment,' he said.

'He served his country with the highest degree of honour and dedication.

'He was a much loved son, brother, uncle and friend and touched the lives of all who had the pleasure of meeting him.

'The family would like to give thanks for the continued support of the Army, police and all who knew and loved Geoff. Our love for him remains as strong as ever. Rest in peace soldier. Faugh-a-Ballagh.'

People living and working near the camp told how the night before Cpl McNeill's body was found, a fight had broken out between two soldiers in Market Drayton, around six miles away from Tern Hill.

The market town is a popular location for servicemen to unwind when they are off-duty and has six pubs within a mile radius.

'Drink involved': Workers in the town of Tern Hill, Shropshire, speculated that alcohol may have been involved

'Brawl': One worker at a shop in the town said that a fighter among the soldiers ahead of his death had begun over something 'innocuous'. It is not known whether Cpl McNeill was involved

Today business owner John Ahmed said an argument broke out in the town following a night of heavy drinking, and that the disagreement continued when the men returned to base.

It is not known if Cpl McNeill had been involved in the dispute.

Mr Ahmed, 53, who owns Tasty's kebab shop, opposite the base at Adastra Services, said: 'The soldiers come in here and we chat but just about the weather and stuff usually.

'It's good business because the soldiers come in here a lot.

'When I spoke to a couple of the people today they said two of them were fighting in town and then it carried on back at the camp.

'I don't know what the argument was about but if there was a lot of drink involved it could have been anything.'

Another worker at the services, who didn't want to be named, said: 'I heard they had had a fight over something pretty innocuous.

'Much-loved': One of Cpl McNeill's brothers issued a statement on behalf of the family praising his 'honour and dedication'

Grateful: Cpl McNeill's family said they wanted to thank the Army and the police for their support

'When they are off-duty a load of them always go out in town for a bit of a drink, especially at the weekends.

'But to see our squaddies rowing with each other is very sad to hear. They should be standing shoulder to shoulder no matter what.

'But when you throw heavy drinking into the equation - anything can go wrong.

'It is a very sad situation indeed.'

Probe: A murder investigation began after the 32-year-old soldier was found dead at Clive Barracks

Tests: A post mortem was carried out over the weekend but further tests have been ordered to try to establish the cause of death

'The man arrested on suspicion of murder is also a serving soldier based at the barracks,' said a police spokesman.'

A post mortem was carried out over the weekend but further tests have been ordered to try to establish the cause of death, a police spokesman said.

The Shropshire coroner John Ellery has been informed of the death.

Detective Inspector Steve Tonks, of West Mercia Police, said: 'We have made an arrest in connection with the death.

'The investigation is in its early stages and extensive inquiries are continuing.

'A post mortem conducted by a Home Office pathologist was held yesterday and further examination and tests are being carried out to help establish the cause of death.'

He also made an appeal to the public for further information and urged anyone who could assist the inquiry to contact Shrewsbury CID.

An MoD spokesman said: 'We can confirm the victim was someone from the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment and we are assisting West Mercia Police with their inquiries.

'Our thoughts are with the family, but it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.

'We can confirm that a soldier from 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment died at Clive Barracks, Tern Hill on 8 March 2014. The soldier's next of kin have been informed.'

A spokesman for RAF Tern Hill said: 'There is an on-going police investigation. We have nothing further to say.'

Base: The barracks opened in 1916 and is currently home to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment

History: The barracks hit the headlines on February 20, 1989 after a pair of IRA terrorists activated two bombs within the accommodation block

The dead soldier is from the same battalion deployed only last month to help flood-stricken communities in Worcestershire, after record amounts of rain fell across the UK.

Members of the unit met Prime Minister David Cameron when he toured some of the county's flood defences at Upton-upon-Severn on February 17.

During that visit, Mr Cameron praised the soldiers' efforts in using their troop carriers to set up a shuttle bus service to get people from one side of the flooded river to the other, while residents also expressed their delight at the military's presence.

The unit returned to its Shropshire barracks after the floodwater receded.

Although it can trace its origins back to 1688, the Royal Irish Regiment formed in 1992 when the Royal Irish Rangers was merged with the Ulster Defence Regiment.Â 

The 1st Battalion, based at Ternhill, Shropshire, is a light role battalion, rotating with two other line infantry/rifles battalions in the air assault role as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade.

The Regiment recruits from all sections of the Northern Irish community, on both sides of the sectarian divide.

In September 2008 the battalion completed
 a tour in Afghanistan and it became the first unit in the Army to 
receive three Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses (CGC) in a single operation

Recently troops from the battalion deployed to Mali in support of the EU training mission and the most recent battalion size operational deployment was in 2011 as part of Operation HERRICK 13 in Afghanistan.

Clive Barracks opened in 1916 and has been home to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment since 2007 when the battalion moved from Fort George, Inverness.

The barracks hit the headlines on February 20, 1989 after a pair of IRA terrorists activated two bombs within the accommodation block.

However, the two men were spotted by a soldier who raised the alarm, leading to the barracks being evacuated and the bombs exploding while no one was there.

The bombers later escaped by hijacking a car from a nearby house.
