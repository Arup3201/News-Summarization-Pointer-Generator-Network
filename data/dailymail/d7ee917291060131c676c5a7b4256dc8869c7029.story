An Arizona man who allegedly revealed during a job interview with U.S. Customs and Border Protection that he had previously molested a two-year-old girl and committed bestiality was released from jail.

Cody Slaughter, 22, of Somerton, was arrested after the admission to officials on July 2.

Customs and Border Patrol agents told the Yuma County Sheriff's Office that Slaughter had confessed to molesting a toddler when he was 14 during a pre-employment screening.

He also admitted to having sexual 
interactions with a pig, a dog and a horse between 2004 and 2012 and 
having a history of drug abuse.

Slaughter's admission came after 
interviewers asked him a standard question about whether he had 
committed any unreported criminal acts.

Slaughter was later interviewed by 
investigators and confirmed his earlier statements were accurate, a 
sheriff’s press release said.

When investigators searched the man’s 
residence, they recovered several items of evidence that directly link 
the suspect to his prior statements and admissions, authorities said.

Slaughter was booked into the Yuma 
County Jail for one count of sexual conduct with a minor involving a 
two-year-old girl and three counts of bestiality spanning from 2004 
until 
present.

On July 10, Judge Jorge Lazano from 
the Yuma County Justice Court ruled that because no criminal complaint 
was filed against the 22-year-old, he must be released, KSWT.com 
reported.

The state has one year to file a misdemeanor charge and an unlimited amount of time for some other charges.
