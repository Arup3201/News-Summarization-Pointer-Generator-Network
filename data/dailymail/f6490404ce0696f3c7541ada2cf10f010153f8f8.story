A pregnant woman who begged for an abortion in Ireland has died after doctors refused, telling her: ‘This is a Catholic country.’

Savita Halappanavar, 31, pleaded  for help after she began to miscarry her baby 17 weeks into her first pregnancy.

Her husband Praveen, 34, claims that although she was in agonising pain, doctors refused to intervene for almost three days because her baby still had a heartbeat.

Mrs Halappanavar, a dentist, died in  Galway University Hospital from blood poisoning, four days after her dead baby was removed.

The case has caused a huge outcry in Ireland, where abortion is illegal. More than 600 demonstrators marched on the Irish parliament, the Dail, last night in protest.

Mr Halappanavar, an engineer, said he believed his wife, a Hindu, would have survived if she had been given an abortion.

‘Savita was in agony,’ he added. ‘She  was very upset, but she accepted she was losing the baby.

When the consultant came on the ward rounds, Savita asked if they could not save the baby, could they induce to end the pregnancy.

‘The consultant said, “As long as there is a foetal heartbeat we can’t do anything”.’

He said that it was the law, that this is a Catholic country. Savita said, “I am neither Irish nor Catholic,” but they said there was nothing they could do.’

Mr Halappanavar told how the couple, who moved to Ireland from India in 2008,  were ‘on top of the world’ about the baby.

However, on Sunday, October 21, his wife began suffering back pain and went to Galway University Hospital.

The 31-year-old, who was 17 weeks pregnant, was found to be miscarrying when she was admitted to Galway University Hospital in Ireland

An hour after being discharged, Mrs Halappanavar became convinced something was wrong, and her husband drove her back to the hospital.

Following a second examination, the couple were told she was having a miscarriage and that doctors would not be able to save the baby.

Mr Halappanavar said he was told the miscarriage would be over in a few hours and that his wife would be able to go home afterwards.

But she began vomiting and shivering uncontrollably on Tuesday night, more than 48 hours after she first arriving at hospital, and her baby died the following day.

After an operation to remove the dead foetus, she was  taken to intensive care and died four days later on Sunday 28 October of organ failure.

A post-mortem examination found she had septicaemia, a form of blood poisoning, and an E.coli infection.

Speaking from India, where he took his wife’s body to be cremated, Mr Halappanavar said: ‘I am distraught, I have lost my soulmate.

‘Doctors refused the termination on the grounds that the foetal heartbeat was still present and being a Catholic country it is not permitted.

A total of 4,149 Irish women came to England and Wales for abortions last year

‘I tried to plead with the  doctors that I am not Irish or a Catholic, so please help and terminate her pregnancy.

'I hope they change the law and make it more people-friendly [rather] than on the basis of religious beliefs.

‘If it had happened in the UK or India, the thing would have been over in a few hours.’

Mr Halappanavar said that he would wait for the outcome of investigations before deciding whether to take legal action against the hospital.

The Health Service Executive has begun an investigation and the hospital has launched a review.

An inquest is also expected to be held. Abortion is outlawed in Ireland, even in cases of rape and incest, or where the foetus has serious abnormalities and is unlikely to survive. Doctors are allowed to intervene only if they believe the mother’s life is at risk.

There have been five referendums on the issue in the past 30 years.

The country’s constitution, which gives a foetus the same rights as a living person, cannot be changed without a popular vote.

Clare Daly, an Irish MP who has campaigned against the abortion laws, said: ‘This is a situation we were told would never arise.

‘An unviable foetus – the woman was having a miscarriage – was given priority over her life, who unfortunately and predictably developed septicaemia and died.’

But Dr Ruth Cullen, of the Pro Life Campaign, said: ‘The guidelines are very clear that all necessary treatment must be given to women in pregnancy.’

Irish premier Enda Kenny said the government would wait for the outcome of the investigations, adding: ‘A child has been lost, a mother has died a husband is bereaved. That is a tragedy.’

It comes just two months after he told Time magazine that he was personally against abortion, adding: ‘I think that this issue is not of priority for government now.’

While abortion is legal almost everywhere in Europe, severe restrictions still apply in some countries - particularly those with large Roman Catholic populations.THE REPUBLIC OF IRELANDAbortion is banned in the Republic of Ireland, where laws governing the procedure acknowledge the 'right to life of the unborn'.In theory, abortion is permitted in the country if there is a risk to the life of the woman - although instances are extremely rare. A provision exists in the Irish constitution for the country's Parliament to legislate on the controversial issue, but no political party has yet opted to do so. More than 4,000 Irish women travelled to the UK to undergo terminations in 2011.NORTHERN IRELANDNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act - which legalised the procedure by registered practitioners and regulated its free provision on the NHS - does not apply. Abortions are carried out in some rare cases in hospitals where a woman's life is directly at risk.
