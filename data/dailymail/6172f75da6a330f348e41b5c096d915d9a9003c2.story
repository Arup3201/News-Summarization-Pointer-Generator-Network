New York Rangers forward Martin St. Louis played in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against Pittsburgh on Friday a day after his mother's death.

Only hours removed from sitting with his family in Montreal trying to come to grips with the death of his mother, St. Louis was in Pittsburgh with his teammates for an emotional 5-1 victory in Game 5 that extended New York's season and served as a fitting tribute to someone St. Louis called 'the best human being I ever met.'

St. Louis' mother, France, died unexpectedly of a heart attack in Montreal on Thursday at age 63.

'I owed it to her to do it,' St. Louis said. 'I know she would have wanted me to play. I was a tough day for everyone, but we've got to keep pushing.'

The Rangers won 5-1 to stay alive in the series.
