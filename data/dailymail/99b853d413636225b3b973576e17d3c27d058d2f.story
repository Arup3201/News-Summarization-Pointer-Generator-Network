James Rodriguez is set for a Â£40million move to Real Madrid - if the Champions League winners can offload Angel Di Maria.

The Colombian playmaker has emerged as one of the stars of this summer's World Cup after his five goals in four games helped guide his side to a quarter-final against Brazil.

And Madrid are ready to start negotiations with his current club Monaco, according to reports in Spain.

Reports: The Spanish papers are confident that Rodriguez is on the verge of signing for Real Madrid

Chairman Florentino Perez will lead the talks, confident that the player is keen to move.

But with a midfield already boasting the likes of Gareth Bale and Luka Modric, the Bernabeu side will look to sell Di Maria to accommodate the 22-year-old former Porto player.

The Argentina star was named man of the match in Real's 4-1 win over rivals Atletico in the Champions League final in Lisbon.

Rodriguez, meanwhile, opened the door to a move to La Liga after scoring twice against Uruguay on Saturday.

'It would be a dream to play in Spain, one of the best leagues in the world,' he told Cadena Cope.

When asked whether he would prefer Barcelona, Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid, Rodriguez said: 'I prefer Real Madrid.'
