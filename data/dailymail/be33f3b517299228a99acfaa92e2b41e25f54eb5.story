Dennis Tueart - who spent eight years playing for Manchester City - believes Sergio Aguero is the most fearsome striker to play a part in Sunday's derby. 

The 64-year-old, who notched 86 league goals for City, believes the Argentine has that added edge as Manchester United travel to the Etihad Stadium.    

SERGIO AGUERO 9.5

The fulcrum of City’s attack. Defenders want everything happening in front of them but he always looks to get in behind. His strength and low centre of gravity make him hard to throw off the ball and his explosive pace and ability to go on either foot make him lethal.

SUPER STAT: Aguero (9) has scored more league goals this season than Wayne Rooney (3), Robin van Persie (3) and Radamel Falcao (1) combined.

EDIN DZEKO 8

An excellent all-round game and such a great finisher in and around the box, but that’s where he should stay rather than dropping deep or drifting out wide.

SUPER STAT: Dzeko has scored four goals in five Premier League games against United.

RADAMEL FALCAO 8

Wants to be involved in everything in the attacking third. He’s got that Denis Law syndrome – he has an incredible hunger to get in the box and score. That desire combined with pace and technique makes him a natural lone finisher.

SUPER STAT: Falcao has two assists in just five Premier League games. Rooney is the only United or City striker who can match that figure.

Rooney is the all-time top goalscorer in the Manchester derby with 11 - and four in his last five away clashes

WAYNE ROONEY 8.5

His skillset makes him a natural No 10 rather than an out-and-out front man. He’s got skill, runs with the ball, passes well and can finish. That’s why he is more effective coming from deep.

SUPER STAT: Rooney is the top scorer in Manchester Derby history with 11. He has four in his last five league visits to the Etihad.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE 8

His mixed form has been representative of United’s transition. He was bought by Fergie, struggled under Moyes but now looks like he’s improving again under Van Gaal.

SUPER STAT: Van Persie has created eight chances in the league this season, more than any other United or City striker.

Robin van Persie's last-gasp equaliser against Chelsea will give him the confidence to kick on
