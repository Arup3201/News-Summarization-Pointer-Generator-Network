World number one Rory McIlroy celebrated his gripping US PGA Championship win by flying off to the city that never sleeps in a private jet.

The 25-year-old and his entourage boarded a flight to New York after he sealed a thrilling, weather-affected climax to the championship, in Valhalla, on Sunday - tweeting an obligatory 'selfie' along the way.

McIlroy carded a closing 68 at 
Valhalla to finish 16 under par, one shot ahead of Phil Mickelson after a
 remarkable final day which finished in near-darkness, with the lights 
blazing from the clubhouse behind the 18th green.

McIlory has put his recent success - which has seen him take his fourth major championship win out of the last 15 played - down to his split from tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.

The world number one split from his ex-fiancée at the end of 
May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding 
invitations.

The 
multi-millionaire has revealed that what happened was 'for the best 
in terms of my golf.'

But he was recently romantically linked with receptionist Sasha Gale, who is from Lisburn, County Antrim, a city just the other side of Belfast from where he grew up.

It is not clear whether Ms Gale joined Mr McIlroy as he celebrated his win in New York, but she did not appear in a flurry of tweets posted to his Twitter account last night.

On her own Twitter account Miss Gale posted at the time of her rumoured boyfriend's win.

She simply wrote '#Speechless', along with an emoticon of a pair of hands clapping.

On her account she boasts that 'being small is a blessing - I call it travel sized.'

Her
 height means she may not suffer the same fate as 5ft 10in Wozniacki, 
who said she had to wear flat shoes while going out with 5ft 8in 
McIlroy.

It was reported that McIlroy took former air stewardess Miss Gale 
out for a high-class meal at Chelsea Wine Bar in South Belfast to 
celebrate his victory in the Open last weekend.

A source revealed the couple got together after meeting five weeks ago and their 'romance is blossoming'.

McIlroy, 25, had been spotted out with model Nadia Forde earlier this month, fuelling speculation they were an item.

But
 his meal with Miss Gale, who says online she likes 'fashion, whiskey, 
sunshine, travelling and fast cars', has buried those rumours.

Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson had been part of a three-way tie for the lead with Mickelson on the back nine but dropped shots on the closing stretch to finish two behind McIlroy on 14 under.

A torrential downpour which flooded the course and caused a delay of almost two hours meant it was a race against time to get play finished, so much so that Mickelson and Fowler stood aside on the 18th to allow the final group to tee off.

McIlroy's drive finished dangerously close to the water to the right of the fairway, but a closing par was enough for the 25-year-old to become the first player since Padraig Harrington in 2008 to win back-to-back majors, his victories in the Open Championship and US PGA also sandwiched by a first World Golf Championship win in the Bridgestone Invitational last week.

Lifting the Wanamaker Trophy for the second time also makes the Northern Irishman the third youngest player after Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus to win four majors, just one less than the total won by the late Seve Ballesteros and two behind Nick Faldo.

It was the fourth time McIlroy had held the 54-hole lead in a major, the first leading to heartache in the 2011 Masters when he was four ahead entering the final round at Augusta only to collapse to a closing 80.

Two months later he bounced back in spectacular style to win the US Open by eight shots at Congressional before winning the 2012 US PGA by the same margin at Kiawah Island.

Last month he led from start to finish at Royal Liverpool, taking a six-shot lead into the final round before going on to win by two from Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler.
