Three dogs have died within two months after drinking water at a popular recreational lake in California filled with toxic algae that flourished during the state's drought. 

Bigger signs will now be installed at Lake Chabot in Castro Valley to warn dog owners, said a spokesman for East Bay Regional Park District.

Pet owners complained that the warning signs were inadequate following the death of the third animal, a five-year-old chocolate Labrador last Wednesday.

Pet owners complained that the warning signs about the toxic algae were inadequate when a five-year-old chocolate Labrador named Josie died on Wednesday after drinking water from Lake Chabot

Carolyn Jones, a spokeswoman for the park district told San Jose Mercury News that the animal deaths are 'tragic' and that they're putting up more signs to keep dogs away from the water

The drought that has been affecting California caused algae to flourish at Lake Chabot in September, when rain and water runoff was not present to flush away impurities in the lake water

Two dogs died in December from the algae's toxins, which attack the animal's nervous system and liver, according to the San Jose Mercury News. 

The slimy blue-green algae has grown on the lake due to the lack of rain and runoff in the area. 

The Labrador, named Josie, was 'healthy as can be' when her owners took her for a walk on Wednesday, according to KTVU. 

But the algae poisoned Josie and she suffered liver failure after she drank from the lake's edge.  

The first dog to die was a white shepherd named Kuch, who collapsed hours after playing in the lake. The second was an eight-year-old cattle dog.  

The park has had a long-time ban on people and pets swimming in the lake because it's an emergency backup water source used for drinking in the East Bay Municipal Utility District.

The lake can still be used, however, for boating and fishing.

Park officials said the lake was not chemically treated because swimming is banned there and it would be difficult to treat the 315-acre lake due to its size.

Signs were posted at the park's entrance and employees warned drivers about the algae threat, though no news release was issued. 

The park district advised anglers and boaters who touch the lake water to wash off with freshwater and to clean guts out of fish before cooking.  

Lake Chabot has remained open despite the algae outbreak.
