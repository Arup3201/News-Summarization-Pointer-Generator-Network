Theresa May last night criticised the Lib Dems for taking credit for tough Tory policies designed to curb rampant immigration – while seeking to block them behind the scenes.

The Home Secretary pointed out that in a Lib Dem campaign handbook the party boasted about cuts in net migration since the election.

But at the same time, she said, the party’s ministers were opposing a new bond scheme forcing new arrivals to cough up £3,000 before they can enter Britain.

Outspoken: Mrs May made a speech about immigration at the Conservative Party conference today

The policy, a Tory manifesto commitment, would see the surety paid by temporary immigrants from high-risk countries – and the money would then be seized if they failed to leave.

She said: ‘Our drive to cut immigration has been so successful that even the Liberal Democrats are boasting about it in their campaign handbook.

‘I don’t remember their enthusiasm for cutting immigration when we worked on the policies – so I’m going to take this with me next time they try to block our reforms.

‘The latest policy they’re fighting is immigration bonds. It’s a simple idea – the Government should be able to take a £3,000 deposit from temporary migrants and return it when they leave. If they overstay their visa, they’ll lose their money.’

She added: ‘Bonds were in our manifesto at the last election. But the Lib Dems suddenly announced that it was their idea.

‘Then they said they were against them. Then they said they were for them – but only to help more immigrants to come here. Now they say they’re against them after all. They were for them, then they were against them, then they were for them and now they’re against them.

‘Confused? Don’t be – the simple conclusion is you can only trust the Conservatives on immigration.’

Mrs
May’s Cabinet colleague Chris Grayling also used his speech to 
criticise the Lib Dems, questioning the party’s opposition to human 
rights reform.

He said: ‘I 
don’t know why. It’s blindingly obvious the public want change. I simply
don’t believe that the majority of the people in this country think 
that human rights laws are fine as they are.’

Mr
Grayling announced that next year ministers will publish a draft bill 
setting out how a Tory government would give the Supreme Court primacy 
over Strasbourg rulings. He said: ‘Our Supreme Court should be in 
Britain and not in Strasbourg. And under a Conservative government it 
will be.’
