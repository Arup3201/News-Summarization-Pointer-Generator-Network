Pentagon officials say two U.S. Navy jets have crashed into the western Pacific Ocean and that one pilot was rescued and a search is on for the other.

The F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets were from Carrier Air Wing 17 based at Naval Air Station Lemoore in California's San Joaquin Valley.

The air wing is embarked on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.

The Navy says the rescued pilot was returned to the carrier and is being treated. It says the planes haven't been recovered.

Officials say other aircraft still in the air in the vicinity were safely recovered.

An F/A-18E Super Hornet crashed in June as it prepared to land on the Carl Vinson off the Southern California coast.

The pilot was able to eject safely.

RT reports that the missing pilot is being searched for by both the cruiser USS Bunker Hill, guided-missile destroyer USS Gridley, and several helicopters.
