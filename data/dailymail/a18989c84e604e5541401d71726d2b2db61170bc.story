A 75-year-old Detroit-area woman on trial for killing her grandson 
stumbled Thursday when a juror asked a key question: Why confront a 
rebellious teenager with a gun?

Sandra Layne didn't give a direct answer so the judge put the question to her again.

'That's just what I thought. I don't know why. I just didn't know what to do,' Layne said between loud, heavy sobs.

There is no dispute that Layne fatally shot Jonathan Hoffman, 17, 
last spring at her home in Oakland County's West Bloomfield Township.

Charged with first-degree murder, she could spend the rest of her life 
in prison if convicted, but she insists it was an act of self-defense 
after months of taking care of a troubled teen.

Layne finished two days of emotional, tearful testimony. She repeated
her claim that she felt threatened by Hoffman, saying he kicked her and
struck her in the head before she shot him.

She said he wanted to get 
out of Michigan and demanded her car and $2,000 after flunking a drug 
test required under his probation in a marijuana case.

But on cross-examination, Layne acknowledged she didn't immediately 
tell police about the assault when they arrested her last May. A nurse 
said there was no evidence nor mention of it during an exam at a 
hospital.

'She said he's a good boy. He would never hurt us. He would never hurt anyone,' nurse Jennifer Colby testified.

Jurors who were given an opportunity to ask questions wanted to know 
why Layne didn't call 911 after she shot Hoffman and why she rushed to 
the basement where there were phones.

Tragic: There's no dispute Layne repeatedly shot 17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman last May in their Detroit-area home

The question was asked because 
Layne has said she didn't want to kill her grandson.

'When I was in the basement, all I was thinking about was I had to 
hide. I was terrified,' she testified. 'Somebody would have done 
something else but that's what I did.'

Layne emerged from the basement and shot Hoffman again while he was pleading with a 911 operator for help.

Hoffman had been living with Layne since 2011 when his parents 
divorced and moved to Arizona.

She said it was a difficult arrangement, 
especially after her grandson was treated in a hospital for using 
hallucinogenic drugs.

Layne said Hoffman was deeply upset on the day of the shooting after 
testing positive for so-called synthetic marijuana. She said she had to 
stop the car three times on the way home to calm him down.

'He's got to sit down. We've got to make a plan,' Layne told the 
jury. 'He's got to talk to people, his mother, his father. We're 
screaming at each other. He said, 'I'm getting out of here. They're 
going to put me in jail.' ... He had to stay here. We had to resolve 
things here.'

Layne said she shot the teen during another argument later at her 
home. She acknowledged in her testimony that she told police that she 
had "murdered" Hoffman.

'I recall saying a few things. I'm screaming, hysterical,' Layne said.

The jury will hear closing arguments Monday. Hoffman's father, Michael Hoffman, was in court but declined to comment.

During her trial last week, prosecutors described how an already wounded Hoffman pleaded with a 
911 dispatcher to send help as Layne shot him again on May 18 last year.

Hoffman 'thought he was safe... Sandra Layne walks up and 
shoots him again. This time in the stomach,' Paul Walton, Oakland 
County's chief assistant prosecutor, said during his opening statement on March 5.

Defense attorney Jerome 
Sabbota countered that the diminutive Layne feared for her safety during
the fatal confrontation in the West Bloomfield Township 
condo that Hoffman shared with his grandparents.

An autopsy revealed 
Hoffman was shot three times in the chest, once in the abdomen and once 
in his left arm. Tests showed the teen had traces of synthetic marijuana
in his body.

Officers had been called to the home northwest of 
Detroit about two months earlier, when Layne told police she was having a
difficult time because her grandson was very upset and yelling. No 
arrests were made that day.

Four days before that, the alternative high school senior was 
pulled over in nearby Farmington Hills and ticketed for possession of 
marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

Layne is 'not a 
murderer,' Sabbota told jurors. 'She was afraid. She felt she 
had no choice. Why else would she shoot him? This is a tragic case.'

Hoffman was living with his grandmother while his mother and father were divorcing and living outside Michigan.

'He was a troubled teen, her favorite grandson, and she took him in,' Sabbota said.

In
Hoffman's 911 call played during Layne's preliminary examination last 
summer, the teen yelled into a cellphone: 'I've just been shot. My 
grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help.'

A few minutes later, he 
tells the operator: 'I got shot, shot again. Please help. Help,' before 
his voice trails off and a woman's shouts are heard in the background.

An
officer testified at Layne's preliminary examination that when police 
arrived, she walked out of her home with her hands up and screamed: 'I 
murdered my grandson.'

A Glock 9mm semiautomatic handgun was found just inside the front door. Nine spent cartridge cases also were found in the house.
