Microsoft's upcoming Windows 8 operating system might have a new look - but it certainly has something in common with previous versions of the operating system.

During a demonstration of the new 'Metro' tablet control system, a demonstration unit 'froze'.

Despite frantic efforts by Microsoft staff, it could not be resuscitated.

Tech site The Register reports that a tablet 'froze' and could not be resuscitated during a demo of Microsoft's upcoming Windows 8

The tiled 'Metro' interface does away with the 'nests' of windows familiar from earlier versions of Microsoft's OS

 Touchscreen compatible - the new operating system will work with tablets and portable devices. There will also be a version for PCs.

Fewer windows
- instead of 'stacks' of windows, as in previous versions, the OS is 
built around clean 'tiles' that deliver information to the home screen.

Free versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint - Windows 8 will offer Office free to tablet users.

Business-friendly tablets - Windows 8 will work smoothly with Microsoft Exchange email systems, so could be highly popular with business.

Apps shared with phones - apps in Windows 8 will be built to work smoothly with phones (such as Nokia's) running Microsoft's Windows Phone OS.

Easier passwords - users will be able to unlock PCs with a PIN, or by circling details in a picture.

No Start button - instead, users will access a menu from a 'hot corner' in the bottom left of the screen.

The incident recalled previous Microsoft launches where Windows devices crashed to the notorious 'Blue Screen of Death' that plagued earlier versions of the software.

A Russian Microsoft exec, Kirill Tatarinov, made light of the incident reported by tech site The Register, saying, 'This is a work in progress folks, as you can see here.

'I think this is a good proof point that this is actually real stuff that we're showing.'

The new version of Windows is expected to launch in October, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The new operating system is the first OS built to work across multiple different devices including tablets, desktop PCs and laptops.

It will also share apps with phones running Windows Phone.

It's seen as a make-or-break opportunity for Microsoft - and a chance to pull ahead of Apple, which still relies on Mac OS X AND iOS.

Tablets and cloud computing have made Bill Gates' vision of ‘a computer on every desk and in every home’ seem 
quaint - Windows 8 aims to adapt the iconic operating system for life in
the mobile world of tablets.

Windows 8 will come in two variations
- one that works on desktops and laptops, and a new version for the ARM
microprocessors in tablets, smartphones and other portable devices. 

The 'tile' interface, where a set of panels bring up 'live' information - showing, for instance, whether there are emails to read, or bring up Facebook posts - is similar to the one found in Windows Phone, and apps will work smoothly across the two

There is no set release date, but 
it's widely expected to be available in autumn - offering Microsoft 
Office free on tablets, which could be a 'killer app' that puts Windows 8
machines ahead of Apple devices.

In both versions, Windows 8 features a
completely new interface, borrowed from what Microsoft calls the 
‘Metro’ style of the current Windows Phone software.
