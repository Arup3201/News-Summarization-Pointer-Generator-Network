Victim: Kim Howe, 69, died in the crash in Malibu, California on Saturday

This is the widowed 69-year-old woman who died in a four-car pileup this weekend involving former Olympian Bruce Jenner.

Kim Howe was driving a white Lexus, which Jenner's Cadillac Escalade rear-ended Saturday on a segment of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California.

The car was pushed into oncoming traffic, and collided with a black Hummer, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant dead. Jenner was unharmed.

Officials released Howe's image Monday, as it came to light that she had not had a valid driver's license since 2007.

Howe's last permit expired that year, and she had never gotten another, the LA Times reported.

It has also emerged that Jenner's Escalade had a sophisticated 'Black Box' inside, which contains critical data including speed and braking information to gauge what the driver was doing for the five seconds before impact, according to TMZ. 

As the other three vehicles will also hold similar data, accident reconstruction experts may be able to use them to determine if Jenner was following too closely behind the Lexus.

More details also emerged about Howe's life in the wake of her sudden, violent death on the road.

According to reports in the New York Daily News, she had lived alone since her husband, Robert, died in 2003.

She had a pet dog, neighbors said, but the beloved animal had recently died. 

Howe, who was childless, was nonetheless 'very socially active', according to one member of the exclusive community in Calabsas, where she lives alongside the likes of Jenner's Kardashian stepdaughters.

Jim Pascucci, a realtor who lived in the neighborhood, and also sold the Howes their $2.5million house, described her as 'sweet' and 'charitable'.

He told the Daily News: 'She was just a very sweet lady. She was an animal activist. She loved dogs and was very socially active with that.'

'She was a very giving lady, very charitable. She and her husband didn't have any kids, so she put all her energy into that. Her husband left her very comfortable.'

Detectives in Malibu continue to work on an investigation into the fatal wreck, with which Jenner is said to be cooperating completely.

He took, and passed, a sobriety test immediately after the crash, and also gave officers a blood sample at a nearby hospital.

Since the crash, Jenner has been seen on the roads again. Monday morning he made a Starbucks run in an inconspicuous Ford Fiesta. 

The former Olympian took the $14,000 compact car out for a spin today after a weekend under the public glare for his driving.

Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation in the crash Saturday afternoon on the Pacific Coast Highway, CNN reports. If any of the drivers in the crash if found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison.

On Monday, detectives said they are planning to ask Jenner to turn over his cell phone records to show whether he was texting while driving at the time of the crash - an activity that could net a vehicular manslaughter charge under California law, the Los Angeles Times reports.

Jenner could also being trying to use the inconspicuous car in the hopes of going incognito as photographers follow him everywhere he goes

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality star has vehemently denied he was texting and driving and said he would gladly offer up his cell phone records to move it. 

At the time he was driving a $76,000 Escalade ESV, which was hauling a dune buggy. 

Jenner, who is in the midst of transitioning from a man to a woman, told police that he was taking a 'very low dosage of hormones that his doctor had prescribed,' a family source told Radar Online.

The very next day, he was spotted out in his Porsche 911 GT3 RS - a 500hp supercar that costs about $185,000. 

Pictures from the outing published by the New York Post show Jenner speeding. He was driving at least 56mph in a 50mph zone, according to a digital speed limit sign on the road. 

It is unknown why Jenner opted to dramatically downgrade his set of wheels.

The pictures were taken on Monday morning as Jenner hit Starbucks in Malibu for his morning coffee fix

One possibility is that he was hoping to go incognito in a low-profile car. The crash comes at a time when Jenner was already at the height of his post-Olympic fame as he prepares to publicly reveal that he is transgender and is becoming a woman. 

He reportedly claimed after the crash that it was the result of him being followed by aggressive paparazzi photographers. 

Investigators said that the paparazzi were not creating a danger and likely not a factor in the crash. 

It could be, too, that Jenner suspected that a less flashy care would attract less attention following two days in the spotlight for his habits on the road. 

On Sunday, Jenner released a statement that said: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident. 

'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'
