A Ukip candidate had to be rescued from high tides at the party's annual spring conference after writing a note on the beach proclaiming his love for leader Nigel Farage.

Sam Gould, 31, the party's Caerphilly candidate, was pictured being hauled out of the water onto a breakwater by press officer Gawain Towler when he became trapped after jumping a wall to scrawl the doting message in the sand.

The debacle began after he hastily jumped down onto the beach early Saturday morning to write a response to protesters.

The message was written on the beach on Saturday at Margate during the party's annual spring conference.

Mr Towler told MailOnline that Mr Gould - 'the enterprising chap that he is' - decided to scrawl the message in the sand in response to messages left on the beach by protesters the previous day.

'Basically it was about 7.30 in the morning and the previous day some Green activists had scribbled some rude stuff in the beach.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage was said to be amused when he saw the message and heard about his candidate's struggle to get off the beach

'I knew nothing of this and I was pottering around the conference hall and I saw the snappers take off looking purposeful.'

Following the commotion, he stumbled across Mr Gould hurriedly scrawling the message in the sand.

But it was after he finished writing the note and proudly posing for photographs that he found himself in trouble.

Mr Towler added: 'Basically, he'd gone down and didn't realise there was no exit because the tide was too far in, so I helped him out.

'It was actually quite hard because that whole breakwater that I pulled him up from - top to bottom - was covered in seaweed. It wasn't the easiest yank I've done.'

However, he did say party leader Nigel Farage managed to see the amusing side of the debacle.

'He just smiled at it. He wasn't there at the time, he arrived a bit later and he saw the scribble on the beach and just laughed.'

Mr Gould told Wales Online: 'I jumped the wall - it was about six to seven feet high - and wrote a message myself in the sand, which said "We love Ukip" and then "We Love Nige".'

'There were no stairs so I got stuck, hence the photo which is quite amazing.'
