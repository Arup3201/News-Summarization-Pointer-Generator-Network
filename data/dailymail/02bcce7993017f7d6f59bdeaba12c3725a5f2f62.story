Britain’s tallest ambulance worker has been named ‘Paramedic of the Year’ after he used his giant 6ft 8in frame as a human ladder to rescue a couple from an arson attack on their home.

Lincoln Dodd, 41, was hailed a national hero after he reached up to save the husband and wife who were trapped in their first-floor bedroom in Belmont, Herefordshire.

Nicknamed ‘Tiny’ by pals, Lincoln managed to lift the pair above the flames after arsonists set fire to their home last September and the couple were able to scramble down his body to the ground.

Hero: 6ft 8in ambulance worker Lincoln Dodd was named 'Paramedic of the Year' after he turned himself into a human ladder to rescue a couple trapped in their upstairs bedroom following an arson attack on their home in Belmont, Herefordshire

In recognition of his bravery, the former A&E nurse was crowned Paramedic of the Year at the Lincoln received his prestigious award at the House of Lords from Baroness Angela Browning.

Speaking after he received the award Lincoln, who has served as a paramedic with West Midlands Ambulance Service for seven years, said: 'The award was a bit of a bolt out of the blue, but very nice all the same.

'Tiny': Lincoln Dodd managed to lift the pair above the flames before the terrified man and wife scrambled down his back to the ground

'I was shocked to just be nominated so I was very surprised when I actually won it.

'I had a lovely day in London with the wife as well, so it was a very memorable day for me.

'To be honest I was just doing my job and I would do the same again if the situation arose.'

Recalling the moment he managed to pluck the stranded pair from the inferno, he added: 'Someone had poured petrol through their letterbox and set it alight, the couple were trapped upstairs.

'I realised I could reach them if they lowered themselves from the upstairs window where they were trapped

'I put my hands up so I could reach their ankles and lowered them onto my shoulders so I could get them down.

'When I was younger I used to get mates up on my shoulders for fun, but this is the first time I’ve ever done that for work purposes.

'I don’t know of anyone in the service bigger than me, when you turn up on jobs you get comments about your height from the people you see, but you have to deal with that.

'There are a couple of rather short paramedics at our station, and we have turned up looking like little and large a couple of times but I tend to work alone.

'My height and big hands do help with heavy lifting, when I’m on my own in the car I can lift people myself rather than having to call in another unit like most would have to.”

The married father-of-four, from Hereford, who weighs 21 stone, admits his size does have its disadvantages.

Bashful: Speaking after he received the award Lincoln, seen here towering over colleague Steve Harget (right) said: 'To be honest I was just doing my job'

He added: 'Cottages are my enemies on the job, I have to duck to get in and out of the ambulance and to go through standard doors, but fortunately I’ve only had one mishap.

'My size has it’s disadvantages, when I first started the job I was all fingers and thumbs trying to do

the more intricate jobs, but you learn to work around it.

'When I was younger I knocked myself out going through a door, I was running and forgot to duck, floored myself.

'But all in all it’s not too bad, I’m pretty flexible so I can squeeze myself into spaces. I recently had to crawl into the front of a crashed Vauxhall Zafira, around the person in the driving seat, so you learn to live with it.”

Lincoln is one inch taller than the second tallest paramedic who stands at 6ft 7ins tall.
