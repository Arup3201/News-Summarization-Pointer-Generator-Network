The World Cup is over and, for the fourth time in history, Germany came out victorious after a 1-0 triumph over Argentina in the final..

There were some simply sublime displays in Brazil, with the likes of Javier Mascherano, James Rodriguez and Manuel Neuer all putting in a series of utterly imperious displays.

But in much the same way as for every reaction, there is an equal and opposite reaction - in football for every brilliant player there is an equally terrible one.

So who were the worst XI in Brazil? Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over eleven men who failed ever so badly in Brazil.

WORLD CUP WORST XI (3-4-3)   IKER CASILLAS (Spain) – Had a blooper reel all of his own. The mis-control that gifted Robin van Persie a goal in the 5-1 defeat to Holland was the pick of the bunch.

Nightmare: Iker Casilass endured a nightmare couple of games as Spain lost to Holland and Chile

PEPE (Portugal) – His tournament ended when he was sent off against Germany for stupidly thrusting his head into Thomas Mueller’s, leaving Portugal with 10 men for nearly an hour. They lost 4-0.

Moment of madness: Pepe's headbutt on Thomas Muller in the Group G opener cost Portugal dearly

GERARD PIQUE (Spain) – The Barcelona defender suffered more than most in the shocking 5-1 defeat to Holland. Endured a torrid time and was not seen again.

Passed by: Gerard Pique was destroyed in Spain's opener, before not being seen again in Brazil

DAVID LUIZ (Brazil) – Has a player’s stock ever fallen so rapidly? A contender for Team of the Tournament, Luiz’s world caved in as Brazil conceded 10 goals against Germany and Holland.

Tearful: David Luiz was woeful in Brazil's horrendous 7-1 defeat to Germany in the semi-final

ANTONIO VALENCIA (Ecuador) – The Ecuador skipper had already been sent off against England in a pre-tournament friendly when he saw red for a late challenge in the final group game with France. No goals, no assists.

Head in hands: Antonio Valencia leaves the pitch after receiving a red card against France

PAULINHO (Brazil) – The Tottenham man was utterly anonymous much of the time. At least his Brazil teammate Fernandinho kept himself occupied by kicking opponents.

Chasing shadows: Paulinho was one of many Brazilian players who was poor throughout the tournament

WILSON PALACIOS (Honduras) – Set about France in the second group game like he wanted to be sent off and got his wish, conceding a penalty in the process.

Why always me? Wilson Palacios was disappointing for Honduras in the group stage

EDEN HAZARD (Belgium) – Contributed two assists but we expected so much more from the Chelsea man. Did Jose Mourinho really say that he’s the best young player in the world?

Underwhelming: Eden Hazard was disappointing  for Belgium in Brazil

LUIS SUAREZ (Uruguay) – No sooner had Suarez knocked out England than he was up to his old tricks, biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini. The striker was out of the World Cup and Uruguay weren’t far behind.

Impact: Luis Suarez had a rather dramatic two games in Brazil against England and Italy

VIDEO Sorry Suarez admits Chiellini bite

FRED (Brazil) – Booed into retirement by his own fans, no-one summed up the dearth of Brazil’s attacking talent better than Fred. One goal against Cameroon was never going to be enough for his critics.

Out of his depth: Fred simply couldn't cut it up front for Brazil

DIEGO COSTA (Spain) – All the talk, all the fuss, all that money Chelsea! Their £32m new signing showed why Spain sometimes prefer to play without a striker.

Not worth the trouble: Diego Costa's impact in Brazil paled in comparison to the hype surrounding him beforehand
