Kevin Nolan accused linesman Andrew Garratt of taking a guess on the decision that prevented West Ham from taking a valuable point at Manchester United.

Nolan thought he had grabbed a 2-2 draw for West Ham when he tapped in Carl Jenkinson's cross in the final minute at Old Trafford, but Garratt flagged for offside and referee Lee Mason disallowed the goal.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce was fuming at the officials over the decision after the 2-1 defeat and his captain was also unhappy with the call, which came at the end of a dramatic match in which Wayne Rooney was sent off.

Andy Garratt was absolutely correct to signal that Kevin Nolan was in an offside position before he ‘scored’ West Ham’s late equaliser. 

Replays showing that his head was closer to the goal line than the defenders proving the decision, while close, was accurate.

Nolan, who came on in the second half, thinks Garratt could not have known whether he was offside as he was not up with play.

'I couldn't believe it,' Nolan said.

'I put the ball in, started celebrating and then I saw the flag.

'I know he has definitely gambled on it because he can't have seen it, because if he had seen it he wouldn't have given it offside.'

Replays showed Garratt had to make a very tight call, with some suggesting the top half of Nolan's body was just in front of his marker as Jenkinson delivered the ball.
