Robbers wielding sledgehammers have staged a smash-and-grab raid at one of the country’s best-known five-star hotels.

A gang of six men pulled up on three mopeds outside the Dorchester Hotel in wealthy Mayfair in central London at around 1.30am today.

They smashed five glass display cases in the foyer, stealing watches and jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds, before speeding off through the city.

In the wake of the heist, which police said was well-planned, the thieves managed to shake off pursuing officers just over a mile away in Shaftesbury Avenue.

One of the bikes hit a 25-year-old woman in Cambridge Circus as the gang fled, leaving her with leg injuries that required hospital treatment.

The glass presentation cabinets were in the main lobby, just beyond the reception and next to lifts to some of the hotel rooms.

One of them contained Brequet and Hublot watches which are worth anything between £6,500 and £31,700 a piece.

The gang also broke into one cabinet that contained jewellery by high-end American designer Harry Winston who has a flagship store on London's New Bond Street.

Other jewellery in several untouched cabinets were pieces made by Faberge.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Detectives from the Flying Squad have launched an investigation following a smash and grab in the early hours of this morning at the Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane.

'Police on patrol in Westminster came across the robbery in progress at the hotel at around 1.37am.

'Officers attempted to follow the mopeds but lost sight of them in the Shaftesbury Avenue area.

'A short while later officers came across a 25-year-old woman who had been hit by one of the mopeds in Cambridge Circus.

'The woman was taken to a south London hospital with leg injuries and has since been discharged. No arrests have been made.

'We will not be discussing the value of the items taken at this stage. It will form part of our investigation.'

A guest, who declined to be named, said all traces of the raid had been swept out of view by the time he went for breakfast mid-morning.

He said: 'They must have dealt with it pretty swiftly to keep us all happy, it's quite a shock.

'They've usually got some very expensive jewellery and watches just 20 metres in but that's all covered at the moment.

'There are a load of cabinets draped with sheeting, but it's discrete and unless you knew what was behind there you'd walk right past it without knowing.

'If the gang managed to get away with anything they'd be laughing, there are Brequet and Hublot watches in those cabinets - and they cost thousands.'

The usual complement of luxury cars 
were parked outside the entrance, including an orange McLaren, a black 
Ferrari and a purple Bentley coupe glinting in the sun.

The
 hotel's security and risk manager, Andy Sloan, stood reassuringly at 
the entrance, although those arriving would be hard-pressed to spot any 
signs of the violent robbery as they walked into the cool atrium.

Detective Constable Alex Flanagan 
said: 'We are in the early stages of our investigation and I would like 
to hear from anyone who was on Park Lane or nearby who may have seen the
 robbery or the men making their escape.

'Likewise I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident that took place in Cambridge Circus.

'This
 was a well planned and thought through robbery and there may be people 
who know who is responsible and I am keen for those with any information
 no matter how small to come forward and assist us with our 
investigation.'

A spokeswoman for the Dorchester said: 'We can confirm that there was an incident at the hotel last night in which showcases were damaged.

The hotel security team were quick to respond and the matter is now in the hands of the police.

'As ever, the comfort and security of our guests and employees remains our top priority.'

This follows a number of similar robberies that have taken place in London’s West End, where thieves have arrived on bikes and tried to smash their way in to jewellery stores.

Masked raiders struck at the Dorchester in 2002 stealing £1million worth of jewellery in a similar robbery.
