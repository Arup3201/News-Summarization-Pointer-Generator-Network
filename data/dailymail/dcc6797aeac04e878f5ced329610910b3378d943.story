The harsh winter has authorities in a Michigan village using explosives to break up dangerously thick river ice for the second year running.

Michigan state officials were called in to the village of Sebewaing on Thursday to clear the ice with explosive charges to prevent the blocked river from flooding.

The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and other agencies conducted the operation to clear the Sebewaing River.

Authorities in the Michigan village of Sebewaing are using explosives to break up dangerously thick river ice for the second year running

The ice has reached 23 inches thick on places and poses a flood risk, so officials decided to try and clear the ice between the village and the mouth of the Sebewaing River where it flows into Saginaw Bay

The village of Sebewaing is 95 miles north of Detroit in the area known as the 'thumb' of Michigan, due to the shape of the state often being referred to as looking like a glove or a hand.

The plan was to break up the ice from the North Center Street Bridge to the mouth of the river, where it flows into Saginaw Bay - a distance of approximately 3,000 feet.

Explosives were used during last year's  harsh winter to break up the river ice for the first time since early 2001.

The thickness of the ice in 2014 was 24 inches, and officials say that this year the ice has already reached 23 inches thick.

The Huron Tribune reported that officials have warned residents that upon completion of the work on Thursday, river ice will be unsafe for any kind of use — especially vehicles.
