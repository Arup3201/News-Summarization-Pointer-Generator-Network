Lawsuit: Associated Investigative Services claims Zimmerman failed to pay more than $27,000 for protection services

A security company has filed a lawsuit against George Zimmerman, his wife and attorney claiming that they owe more than $27,000 for protection services.

Associated Investigative Services filed the lawsuit in Orange County Circuit Court on Friday against Zimmerman, who is awaiting trial on second-degree murder charges in relation to the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.

The civil complaint, which is also against his wife and attorney Mark O'Mara, claims O'Mara hired the company in June to provide security for the Zimmerman family but promised payments stopped after an independent trustee took over Zimmerman's defence fund.

The company provided a detail for Zimmerman's second bond hearing on June 29, according to the complaint, and the arrangement stepped up into 'nearly constant' watch on Zimmerman's family.

But AIS alleges payments stopped soon after an independent trustee took over the defence fund, the Orlando Sentinel has reported.

The company says O'Mara told Zimmerman and the trustee wanted to 'clamp down' on the defence fund because it was running low.

The lawsuit alleges breach of contract, among other claims, and requests a monetary judgment of $27,027.08.

O'Mara told the Orlando Sentinel he was surprised the suit had been filed.He said 'We've paid them over $40,000'

He said the company no longer provided protection to George and Shellie Zimmerman, partly because at one point it was billing them $7,000 per week, whereas they are now paying $700 a week for protection.

The AIS complaint acknowledges the $40,000 paid and also says the company warned O'Mara the amount of security he requested was 'excessive'.

Zimmerman is awaiting trial on second-degree murder charges in the shooting of Trayvon Martin.

Zimmerman contends the unarmed teenager attacked him and is claiming self-defense in the February killing. Zimmerman is free on $1 million bail and is in hiding.
