Authorities in Pennsylvania are to file criminal charges against three students involved in a brutal beating on a school bus on Wednesday - and the bus driver who did nothing to stop the attack and didn't allow the two victims to flee from the vehicle.

Police in Chester acted after they viewed video posted onto Facebook that shows one student on the Delaware County Alternative High School bus allegedly hitting 17-year-old Dylan Fonner in the face repeatedly.

The grainy video which shows Fonner's face being bloodied, lasts seven minutes and was posted on the Facebook page belonging to one of the alleged offenders and was tagged to the second alleged offender, both 16, as well as the 16-year-old girl they were with on the bus.

In addition to the beating on Fonner, the three alleged attackers also hit his friend CJ Buonadonna once and both he and Fonner claimed that after the attack, which the bus driver did not stop, all three retreated to the back and watched their video.

Pictures provided by Jackee Fonner, Dylan's mother show the 17-year-old with a swollen and cut lip, a bruised nose and three chipped teeth.

Inaction: The bus driver can be seen at the top left hand of the screen - it is alleged that the driver did nothing to stop or intervene during the beating on Wednesday

Their neighbor, Judy Blair told CBS Philly that she was stunned the bus driver did nothing to intervene.

'Why didn’t the bus driver, I can’t understand how he can sit there and see this happen and not put a stop to it? I know things happen on a bus but kids will be kids but this went too far, it really did.'

While the three attackers, not the bus driver have been identified, Dylan's mother said she was appalled at the inaction from the only adult at hand as her son was beaten.

'Very frustrating and very angry because our children are supposed to be safe and now it’s not only do you have to worry about your child being safe in school but now you have to worry about the bus ride too,' Dylan’s mom said to CBS Philly.

Outraged: Dylan's mother Jackee Fonner said that she wanted charges pressed and the role of the driver examined

Appalled: Chester City Police Commissioner Joseph Bail says that if a grown up was present it is unacceptable for them not to have intervened

'He didn't even give my son a cotton ball to clean the blood off of him, my son had to use his flannel shirt to clean his face off. He just did absolutely nothing,' Jackee Fonner said to ABC 6.

Chester Police Commissioner Joseph Bail confirmed to CBS Pilly that police detectives are in the process of filing criminal charges against three students and the bus driver.

Buonadonna said that he suspected the assault was because of an argument that began earlier in the day at school for children with behavioral issues during his wood shop class.

'It started about three minutes into the drive,' said Buonadonna to the Delco Times.

Both Buonadonna and Fonner said that they have both been bullied before by the same two students.

'I was crying and furious at the same time,' Fonner said to the Delco Times about the beating.

The Chester City Police Commissioner Joseph Bail confirmed after seeing the video that not only did the 34-year-old bus driver not step in, but the district never reported the assault.

'I have a problem with a grown adult not reporting it,' Bail said.

The names of the three students and the bus driver have not been released.
