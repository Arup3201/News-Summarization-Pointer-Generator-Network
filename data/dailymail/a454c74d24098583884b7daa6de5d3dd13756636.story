High-flyer: Banker Svetlana Lokhova, who nicknamed ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ during a smear campaign by her bullying male colleagues, is claiming compensation of £14 million after she won her employment tribunal

A high-flying banker nicknamed ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ during a smear campaign by her bullying male colleagues is claiming compensation of £14 million after she won her employment tribunal.

Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova, who worked in the London office of Russian firm Sberbank, said she was victimised before being unfairly dismissed.

Last November, the tribunal rejected 19 of the 22 complaints made by Miss Lokhova but found in her favour on the substantive areas of harassment and intimidation on the grounds of her gender.

The tribunal heard that colleagues referred to her as 'mad Svetlana', 'Crazy Miss Cokehead' and told her to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to 'calm her down.'

She was also branded 'crazy, mental, totally unstable, quite likely clinically bonkers' and 'a major car crash.'

Miss Lokhova claimed she had been targeted because she had previously reported a senior trader for insider dealing, who was later dismissed.

The tribunal also ruled that her main tormentor David Longmuir should have been fired from the bank for gross misconduct.

Mr Longmuir, Miss Lokhova’s former manager at Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd, not only sent a host of emails but also made remarks behind her back that were 'offensive and derogatory and often personal in nature.'

He referred to Miss Lokhova as 'Miss Bonkers' said she had 'unfortunate natural brain chemistry' and described the daughter of a Russian shipping broker as 'living in a flat that Daddy bought.'

Today Miss Lokhova told Central London Employment Tribunal even though she had won her case, being dragged though the courts had ruined her reputation and meant she would never work in finance again.

'I am completely broken down and exhausted by the respondent’s campaign against me,' she said. 

'I endured six months of abuse at work and almost three years of highly acrimonious litigation which has had a profound aspect on every part of my life.'

She said she had even been referred to with the 'Little Miss Cokehead' nickname at a family gathering because of publicity. And because the bank had dragged her sister’s name into proceedings, her sibling refused to speak with her.

'My name will be forever linked with drug addiction and mental instability,' said Ms Lokhova. 'I have suffered extreme detriment and could not hope to return to financial services.

'It is a highly regulated industry and no one would want to employ someone accused by a previous manager of being a cocaine addict and mentally unstable.

'I can never return to financial services again, which I loved and where I was enjoying considerable success. Everybody knows everybody’s business in banking and people believe there is no smoke without a fire. My reputation has been shredded.'

Sberbank, the former Soviet savings bank, has been transformed under Herman Gref, a former economy minister for Russian president Vladimir Putin.

The bank is Russia’s largest lender, held almost half of the nation’s deposits last year and has diversified into investment banking and asset management.

The resources of Sberbank and its subsidiary Troika Dialog UK, where Miss Lokhova worked, have now been integrated under Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd. 

Ms Lokhova said she was employed because of her proven ability to make money and, had she not been harassed, would have continued to make money for the bank.

In her first period of employment, from 2008 until 2010, she said she was earning £80,000, which rose to £120,000 in 2009.

She left for a year, but was offered a job at the bank in 2011 - which is when the discrimination occurred that led her to take sick leave in January 2012.

Had she remained in employment she claims she would have been rewarded pay rises of ten per cent until it reached £200,000.

In this period she received a bonus of £189,000 in 2009.

She also pointed out she had generated £5.7m of a £18.8m profit for the bank and was awarded a cash bonus of £570,000.

'There was only one other employee who earned a larger cash bonus than this,' she added.

Ms Lokhova, who has appeared as a Russia expert on BBC Radio 4’s the Today Programme, said the only other field she could hoped to be employed in was academia, which would pay far less than banking.

She added she was hugely in debt after the litigation, accusing the bank of trying to drag the procedure out as long as possible so she would run our of money and be forced to give up.

'The bank believes I am entitled to no compensation,' she said. 

'The bank chose to throw all its resources into defending the claim. As a result everything I have worked for in life has been irretrievably damaged. I spent £1.2million at the liability stage.'

Success: The bank is Russia’s largest lender, held almost half of the nation’s deposits last year and has diversified into investment banking and asset management

She also said she had not received any apology from the bank and despite the tribunal’s findings Mr Longmuir should have been fired, he was not.

She added: 'Despite the tribunal’s findings those responsible have not been punished and the bank has offered no apology for its wrongdoing.

'David Longmuir left the bank under a compromise agreement, the bank decided it would not dismiss him. The other individuals have not been investigated. No reforms have been made.

'The lack of remorse the respondent has shown adds credibility to their derogatory remarks.'

The bank accuses her of wanting to get as much money out of them as she can, pointing out she did not raise initial grievance until after she had been paid her bonus in 2012.

The bank also questions whether she was indeed worth the amount of money she is claiming she was, adding she “lacked the multifaceted experience” she would have needed to earn those sums had she she stayed in 2012.

It also accuses her of lying about her inability to return to a career in finance, saying she has exaggerated the damage to her reputation.

The tribunal continues.
