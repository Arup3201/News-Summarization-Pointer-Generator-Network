James Milner's future at Manchester City may not be resolved until the end of the season.

The in-demand England international is out of contract at the end of the year and talks have taken place about extending his stay at the Etihad Stadium.

However, no deal has been agreed for Milner, who has attracted interest from the likes of City's Premier League rivals Liverpool and Arsenal.

Sportsmail understands preliminary talks have also taken place with Inter Milan, AC Milan and Roma while two clubs in Spain are monitoring the situation.

Milner's first choice remains a contract extension at City.

But the 29-year-old midfielder remains unconvinced Manuel Pellegrini can give him the playing time he craves at this stage of his career.

Milner is now expected to use the remainder of the season to gauge how much he is needed at the club.

City face a fight to retain their Premier League title from leaders Chelsea and will head to the Nou Camp next week seeking to overturn a 2-1 Champions League deficit to Barcelona.

Regular playing time in his preferred position in central midfield at the business end of the campaign may well persuade him to stay in Manchester.

Milner has already made 36 appearances for Pellegrini's side this season and has been in good form.

He joined City from Aston Villa for £26m in 2010.
