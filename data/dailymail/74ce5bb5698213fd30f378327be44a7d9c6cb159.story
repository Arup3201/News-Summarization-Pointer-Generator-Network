It has become common practice for manufacturers around the world to sell phones and tablets with less storage space than is advertised on the box.

And while many users are happy to put up with this discrepancy, two iPhone owners have decided to take Apple to task about it.

In a suit filed in Miami, the pair accuses the tech giant of 'concealing, omitting and failing to disclose' that on 16GB versions of iPhones, more than 20 per cent of the advertised space isn't available.

The lawsuit was filed by Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara from Miami.  They accuse the tech giant of 'concealing, omitting and failing to disclose' that, on 16GB versions of iPhone 6 Plus models that have iOS 8 pre-installed, in excess 20 per cent of the advertised storage space is not available (illustrated in this graph)

The lawsuit has been filed by Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara from Miami. They are suing Apple both individually, 'and on behalf of all others similarly situated.'

'Apple’s misrepresentations and omissions are deceptive and misleading because they omit material facts that an average consumer would consider in deciding whether to purchase its products,' explained the suit, first spotted by Silicon Beat. 

'Namely, that when using iOS 8, as much as 3.7GB of the represented storage capacity on a device represented to have 16GB of storage capacity is, in fact, not available to the purchaser for storage.'  

And a chart contained within the files shows that this discrepancy doesn't just apply to the latest models of the device. 

Older models that update to iOS 8 similarly suffer. For example, storage space on the iPhone 5S drops by 18.8 per cent, the iPad Air drops by 21.3 per cent, and the iPod by as much as 23.1 per cent, in comparison to advertised space. 

The files continued: 'Apple fails to disclose that upgrading from iOS 7 to iOS 8 will cost a device user between 600 MB and 1.3 GB of storage space - a result that no consumer could reasonably anticipate.

In January, Which? tested eight 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google (pictured). Samsung's Galaxy S4 was worst performing handset, with only 54 per cent (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was best, with 79 per cent (12.6GB)

California-based analyst Neil Cybart recently studied Apple’s iPhone storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry-level phones, customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger, more expensive, device the following year. This ultimately makes the firm an extra $3billion (£1.9 billion) each year

'To put this in context, each gigabyte of storage Apple shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400-500 high resolution photographs.'  

'The matter in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 exclusive of interests and costs,' added the files, and the pair is demanding a jury trial. 

Apple doesn't comment on ongoing court cases.

The iPhone 6 16GB has a similar amount of storage as the iPhone 5S, at 12.2GB, which has been dubbed 'inadequate' by users. 

Apple offers the iPhone 6 Plus (left) and iPhone 6 (right) in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models

By limiting the amount of storage on entry-level phones, in the ‘lower tier’, customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device, in the middle tier, the following year.

These customers are more likely to then stay in the middle tier, or in some cases move to the upper tier, but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage.

This trend is even more common if Apple keeps the entry-level the same, but boosts the storage by three times or more in the following year.

However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but stay in the lower tier.

All of these figures are taken from Neil Cybart's Above Avalon site.  

In year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version.

The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. The current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are available in these sizes, for example.  

This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two. This 64GB costs more than the 32GB version did the previous year.

By the third year, Apple can offer 32GB as an entry-level model, but the customer won’t downgrade storage and stays with the 64GB as a minimum.

Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model.

And so on into year three, if Apple offers 64GB as a minimum.

This means they spend less money each year, and Apple can't move customers from the lower to the middle or higher tiers.

California-based analyst Neil Cybart recently studied Apple’s iPhone storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry-level phones, customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger, more expensive, device the following year. 

He claims Apple makes an extra $3 billion (£1.9 billion) each year by not doubling the amount of minimum storage every time a new model is released.

‘Apple's decision to keep the entry-level storage tier at 16GB for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, despite doubling the other capacities to 64GB and 128GB, continues to raise eyebrows,’ explained analyst Neil Cybart on his Above Avalon site. 

‘Apple's near-term motive behind keeping the 16GB capacity option is pretty clear: get people to buy the 64GB option.’

But, as Mr Cybart explained, Apple’s strategy is more complex, and forward-thinking than that.

He believes that by limiting the amount of storage on entry-level phones, in what he calls the ‘lower tier’, customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device, in the middle tier, the following year.

However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but stay in the lower tier. According to Mr Cybart's calculations, Apple's middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion)

These customers are then more likely to then stay in the middle tier, or in some cases move to the upper tier, but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage.

This trend is even more common if Apple keeps the entry-level the same, but boosts the storage by three times or more in the middle tier, the following year.

However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but will always stay in the lower tier.

According to Mr Cybart's calculations, the middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. 

But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion). 

This is a difference of $3 billion (£1.9 billion). 

Mr Cybart claims that this difference is based on Apple charging an average $20 (£13) more for the handsets year-on-year. 

If Apple charged more, the difference would be greater.  

For example, in year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version.

The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two at a higher premium than the 32GB cost the previous year.

By the third year, Apple can offer 32GB as an entry-level model, but the customer won’t downgrade storage and stays with the 64GB as a minimum.

Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model.

And so on into year three, if Apple offers 64GB as a minimum.

Mr Cybart also worked out how much revenue Apple makes by keeping the 16GB model as a minimum, and using the middle tier strategy.

According to his calculations, the middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. 

But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion) - a difference of $3 billion (£1.9 billion), simply by charging an average $20 (£13) for the handsets.

‘By doubling the middle tier storage capacity to 64GB, while maintaining the price, and keeping the 16GB storage capacity at the bottom tier, I estimate that approximately 30 per cent of previous 16GB iPhone owners will upgrade to 64GB to take advantage of the better deal,’ continued Mr Cybart.

‘While some may say this discussion profitability is anti-consumer, observers need to look at this process as a bit more than just greed.

‘A case can be made that Apple is looking to get users dependent on higher storage, by carefully guiding customers into a particular iPhone model each year.’
