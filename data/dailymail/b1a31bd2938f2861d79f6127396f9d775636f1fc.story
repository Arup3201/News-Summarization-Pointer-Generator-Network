Biter! Catherine Demery, 19, crashed whilse driving 'super drunk' and then bit an officer on the arm while resisting arrest

A 19-year-old Michigan woman who police say crashed a vehicle in Ypsilanti while driving 'super drunk' bit an officer on the arm while resisting arrest.

Catherine Demery was arraigned earlier this month after being charged with a string of offenses.

Michigan's
 'super drunk' driving law has enhanced penalties for anyone caught 
driving with a blood-alcohol content of .17 percent or higher

Ypsilanti police say it was obvious that Demery was drunk as she ended up losing control of the car.

Charges include: unlawful use of a 
motor vehicle, operating while intoxicated, operating with a blood 
alcohol content higher than .17, two counts of resisting or assaulting a
 police officer, possession of marijuana, malicious destruction of 
property, driving with a suspended license and being a minor in possession of 
alcohol.

Demery then failed sobriety tests and resisted arrest. 'She bit an officer,' Detective Sgt. Thomas Eberts said to Michigan Live.

Michigan's 'Super Drunk' law applies 
to drivers with no prior OUI convictions within the past seven years who
 operate a motor vehicle with a BAC of .17% or higher.

Drivers
 with a prior conviction within seven years face enhanced penalties, 
even more harsh then those for a typical Super Drunk conviction.

For
 someone in a traditional drunk driving case with a blood alcohol conent
 below .17%--you could face a maximum of 93 days in jail. The maximum 
jail sentence for a Super Drunk case is 180 days—almost double.  The 
length of a driver’s license suspension is also increased, as are the 
fines.

A conviction 
under the new legislation will compromise your driving privileges and 
jeopardize your present and future employment. You will also have 
created permanent criminal record for yourself

Charged: They include unlawful use of a motor vehicle, operating while intoxicated, operating with a blood alcohol content higher than .17, two counts of resisting or assaulting a police officer, possession of marijuana and driving with a suspended license

The officer was bitten on the arm and did not require any medical attention.

It turned out the vehicle belonged to Demery's boyfriend, and she did not have permission to drive it.

The
 incident happened last September but she wasn't arrested until results 
from blood tests came back when it was found she was well over the 
drink-drive limit.

Demery is now on a $5,000 bond with an additional court date set for next month.
