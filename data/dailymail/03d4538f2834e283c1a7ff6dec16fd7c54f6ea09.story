Diving star Tom Daley has recalled the moment he won a bronze medal at London 2012 as he encourages Londoners to use the world-class facilities at the Olympic Park which officially opens to the public tomorrow.

The 19-year-old admits he is still flooded by memories every time he steps through the doors of the Aquatics Centre in Stratford where he won his first Olympic medal.

Now the public are able to use the same facilities – whether they just want to go for a swim or test out their own skills on the diving board.

The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will be fully opened to the public for the first time since London’s Olympic and Paralympic Games on Saturday, April 5, and Daley hopes people in the city will now make the most of the world class facilities on their doorstep.

He said: ‘The facilities we’ve got here are second to none. Even if people just want to come and try it, have a swim and stay fit and active, that’s hopefully what the Olympic legacy has left behind.’

Reminiscing about the 2012 Games, the diving champion says he relives his medal wins every time he visits the centre, and uses those memories to help him with his training.

In a video for VisitLondon.com, he said:
 ‘To compete in this Aquatics Centre in London 2012 was the most amazing
 experience. It’s just more than what you could ever imagine.

‘There were 18,000 people in here, the noise was just phenomenal, and then to stand on the podium and finally have an Olympic medal around my neck was just amazing.

‘Every time I walk in I just get those floods of memories and emotions of when I was on that board and won my Olympic bronze medal.’

As well as the Aquatics Centre, Daley says there’s plenty more to be explored around the park.He added: ‘There are so many places to come and explore around Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

‘You can go and chill out on some of the green spaces, you can walk past the Olympic Stadium, the Velodrome, Copper Box and the Aquatics Centre.

‘You can also go up to the top of the Orbit and enjoy panoramic views of the city.’

Daley also recalled his first ever visit to London when he was just nine-years-old.

He said: ‘My earliest memory of London was coming up with my family when I was nine-years-old and going on the London Eye.

‘I remember going up on the London Eye and just thinking: “Wow”.’

The diving star can often be seen training at the Aquatics Centre and will be taking part in the men’s 
10m Platform event being held there at the FINA/NVC Diving World Series on Sunday, April 27.

Daley moved to Stratford in London earlier this year to be close to the Park and the keen foodie has made the most of the capital's famous restaurants.

He said: ‘I’m a massive fan of Beef Wellington and I had an amazing one at Bob Bob Ricard. And I’ve loved Inamo in Soho; that’s a really cool place where they project the menu onto the table.’
