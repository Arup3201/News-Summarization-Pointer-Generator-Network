These shocking images show the moment a drunk thug tried to steal a bag from a disabled man - and ended up hauling him off his mobility scooter and onto the ground after the bag's cord got stuck around his victim's neck.

Daniel Jones, 23, attacked the vulnerable 42-year-old when he spotted him outside a supermarket in Coventry, West Midlands, on February 18.

CCTV footage released by police shows the moment the thug creeps up behind his victim and tries to snatch the bag from his back.

Daniel Jones, 23, left, eventually admitted robbery after CCTV footage caught him snatching the bag of his disabled victim, right, outside a supermarket in Coventry, West Midlands, on February 18

However, as Jones tries to grab the bag, the shoulder strap snags around the victim’s neck - leaving him gasping for breath.

As Jones tries to yank the bag free, the force pulls the victim off the 50kg scooter which ends up toppling backwards and landing on top of the disabled man.

The 27-second video then shows the moment the thug finally manages to untangle the bag’s cord - falling backwards as it breaks free - and flees leaving the vulnerable man trapped helplessly on the floor.

A court heard Jones had approached his victim near a bus terminal at 2am and asked for a cigarette before making a callous grab for the draw-string bag.

A security guard gave chase as he ran towards the canal bridge but backed off when Jones shouted threats to stab him.

However, Jones was unaware the attack had been caught on CCTV and was arrested when he returned to loiter around the same car park just minutes later.

Officers discovered the victim’s Ben Sherman watch hidden down his trouser leg and a police dog quickly found the stolen Adidas bag containing an inhaler and a crucifix at a nearby canal-side.

Jones, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, refused to accept the attacker caught on camera was him even when he was shown the CCTV footage. But he was picked out by his victim and a supermarket security guard during an ID parade

Jones, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, refused to accept the attacker caught on camera was him even when he was shown the CCTV footage.

But he was picked out by his victim and a supermarket security guard during an ID parade and admitted robbery at Coventry Crown Court on April 2.

Jones was jailed for a total of three years and four months - 28 months for the robbery and an extra 12 months for breaching a suspended prison sentence imposed at Warwick Crown Court last September for an assault on 27 December 2012.

He told police he had visited a friend to smoke cannabis and drink strong home-brewed cider - which left him ‘nine out of 10 drunk’ and unable to account for his actions.

After the case, Detective Constable Lee Buckler, from West Midlands Police, said the heartless attack was one of the worst he had seen in his career.

He added: ‘Claiming not to remember the incident was no defence.

‘The fact the victim didn’t suffer serious injury was down to luck rather than any conscious act by Jones.

‘The security team at Ricoh Arena did a marvellous CCTV job - directing officers to make a swift arrest and providing key evidence - and a security guard made a brave attempt to detain Jones despite him threatening violence.

‘This was a cowardly attack against a man Jones knew was not in a position to defend himself.

‘It’s one of the most shocking incidents I’ve investigated but thankfully attacks like this on vulnerable people are rare.’
