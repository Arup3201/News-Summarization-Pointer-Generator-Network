A groom died hours after marrying his bride during the wedding reception after he tripped over and landed on a beer glass.

Fabio Jefferson Maciel, 33, had wed fiancee Geise Guimaraes six hours before bleeding to death following the freak tragedy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Over 200 people had watched the couple tie the knot in a church ceremony before heading on to a lavish reception at a beachside club.

Wedding tragedy: Fabio Jefferson Maciel (left) died six hours after he married Geise Guimaraes (right) in Rio de Janeiro. A beer glass smashed in his pocket and severed his femoral vein.

Witnesses said Mr Maciel, a Brazilian navy sergeant, was fooling around with one of the young bridesmaids at 2am on Monday morning when he tripped and fell on his front.

A beer glass which he had put in the left-side trouser pocket shattered and a piece severed his femoral vein - a major artery to the top of the leg - causing rapid blood loss.

Mr Maciel died on the way to hospital in the Ilha do Governador district of the city.

Friends said Mr Maciel had been planning the perfect wedding since the start of the year, when he had also started building a home for him and his wife-to-be to begin their married life.

The house was finished just a week ago.

Shock: Guests come to terms with the tragedy at the beachfront venue in Rio de Janeiro where the wedding reception was being held

Wedding invitations were sent out five months ago and the groom's family flew in from his home city of Manaus, north Brazil, for the ceremony.

Fabiana Sena, 31, a friend of the couple, said Mr Maciel's widow is still in a state of shock.

She told Brazil's O Globo newspaper: 'She just cries and says "I want my husband back". Nobody can believe what happened, and even less the way it happened.'

Mr Maciel's body is due to be flown back to Manaus, where family members will attend his funeral on Wednesday.
