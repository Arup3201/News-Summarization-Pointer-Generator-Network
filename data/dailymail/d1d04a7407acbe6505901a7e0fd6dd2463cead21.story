Amtrak workers have gone back to school after a New York City-bound train took a wrong turn and wound up in the Philadelphia suburbs on Thursday.

Officials are investigating how Amtrak Train 644 got onto the wrong tracks after leaving Philadelphia's 30th Street 
Station for Penn Station.

The
 train traveled several miles before crew realized their mistake and stopped at Bala Cynwyd station.

What the? Amtrak Train 644 left 30th Street Station for New York City on Thursday but bizarrely ended up at a local Philadelphia train station

The local train station is serviced by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.

The train allegedly missed a signal after leaving Philadelphia.

The 130 passengers were returned to Philadelphia where they boarded another train for the Big Apple.

Amtrak’s media relations director, Steve Kulm, said the crew members are being re-trained.

'An investigation was 
launched and the crew has been held out of work until they can be fully 
debriefed and additional training can be conducted,' he said in a statement, according to CBS Philly.

Well, that's embarrassing: Amtrak crew took a wrong turn, landing at Bala Cynwyd station after leaving 30th Station in Philadelphia instead of heading to New York Cuty

Amtrak, or the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, has been widely criticized for its ongoing issues with scheduling, delays and 'second-rate service'.

The federal organization has reportedly never turned a profit since it began 40 years ago, while consuming almost $40 billion in federal subsidies. 

According to its website, Amtrak earned approximately $2.51 billion in revenue and incurred approximately $3.74 billion in expense in the 2010 financial year.

In his 2010 book, National Association of Railroad Passengers founder Anthony Haswell described Amtrak as a 'massive failure because it’s wedded to a failed paradigm'.

'It runs trains that serve political purposes as opposed to being responsive to the marketplace,' he wrote.

'America needs passenger trains in selected areas, but it doesn’t need Amtrak’s antiquated route system, poor service and unreasonable operating deficits.'

Last week, Congress held the latest in a series of hearings on Amtrak's inability to manage its food service.The Atlantic Cities reported Amtrak has lost more than $609 million on food and beverage since 2006.

Meanwhile, Charlotte Observer reported an Amtrack collided with a car in west Charlotte on Monday, while Chicago News Tribune said a Detroit-bound train from Chicago stopped for six hours outside a station because of an equipment problem two days ago.
