Harry Redknapp believes grappling and holding have come into English football due to players and youngsters watching foreign football on television.

The Queens Park Rangers manager claims the practice did not take place back when he was a player and that children are taught from a young age to mark correctly from set pieces.

Redknapp said: 'No-one grappled in those days, it's a new thing. It was watching foreign football. In Italian football they used to mark like that years ago. It didn't happen in England.

'Hopefully people will learn to mark correctly. You can't mark looking at the opponent when the corner's being played in. I've said it for years.

'If someone is taking a corner and I'm a defender and I'm looking at you and not the ball – how can that be the way to mark? All I'm doing is trying to stop you and grab hold of you and stop you heading the ball.

'Maybe people will get their position right, get sideways on, so they can see the ball and the man. That's what you teach kids when they come into football clubs at 11 years of age.

'You don't teach kids to grapple hold of someone, just pull them. That's happening more and more hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it.'

According to Redknapp, the problem will never be stamped out until referees start taking stricter action against it.

He would have no problem if officials told managers and teams before games that they were going to start handing out yellow cards and awarding penalties if it takes place.

Redknapp added: 'It is happening more and more. It's so difficult, how many penalties are you going to give a game? Six? Seven? I suppose until refs start penalising people for doing it, it will carry on.'
