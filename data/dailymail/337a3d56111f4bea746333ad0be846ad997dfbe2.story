Footage has now emerged of the incredible morning raid on the New Zealand mansion of a man at the head of a suspected Internet piracy website.

Helicopters, police dogs and more than 70 specially trained officers - some heavily armed with semi-automatic assault rifles - were involved in the land and air raid on the property of Megaupload.com boss Kim 
Dotcom - also known as Kim Schmitz.

The January 20 raid was part of an 
investigation of his website spearheaded by the FBI in the U.S.

Armed raid: Members of the Special Tactics Group, armed with assault rifles, run toward the door of Dotcom's mansion near Auckland. Inside are Dotcom and his family, some guests and staff - all unarmed

Simultaneous ground assault: As the first helicopter leaves, a police vehicle (highlighted) can already be seen on the property. Dotcom's lawyers have asked why helicopters were even necessary in the raid

The operation, where police executed warrants to seize 
computer hard drives from the mansion, has since been ruled illegal by the New Zealand High Court.

The footage, edited from in-flight helicopter cameras and Dotcom's own security CCTV system, shows the sort of raid usually witnessed in over-the-top Hollywood films.

Aired on New Zealand's 3News TV programme, and re-broadcast on YouTube, it shows members of New Zealand's Special Tactics Group - armed with Colt Commando assault rifles and Glock handguns - arriving in two helicopters at 6.47am, with dog squad officers and more armed authorities arriving in cars and vans almost immediately after.

Colt Commando: The U.S.-made AR15 assault rifle, which was carried by members of the raid as their 'primary' weapon. Specialist officers also carried a 17-shot Glock handgun and extra ammunition

Evidence: Kim Dotcom describes to the court the events of January 20 this year, while the picture above right shows armed officers on the roof of Dotcom's mansion as the raid unfolds

Inside the house are Dotcom, his pregnant wife, their three children and a number of guests and staff. There is no suggestion that any of them were armed.

Raid planners say the airborne force was necessary because Dotcom's property had security gates that prevented police from approaching with vehicles. Their swift arrival was crucial, as Dotcom or a member of his staff could erase important evidence from hard drives on the property.

But the gates to the property are clearly open as the first helicopter flies in, and multiple vehicles can be seen simultaneously closing in on the house.

Later an officer reveals over his radio that there are only two security staff members on the entire property.

Police response: Arrows point to four separate police vans and vehicles on the Dotcom property less than 20 minutes after the first helicopter landed in the driveway

Officers from the second helicopter even run through the opened and unmanned gates.

Dotcom and his legal team also contest the authorities' 'element of surprise' justification, saying that the FBI had seized servers and had made it impossible for anyone to erase hard drives before the raid had even taken place.

The footage shows what is generally known to have happened in the raid, but Dotcom's lawyers - both in New Zealand and the U.S. - are concentrating on why the raid was so heavy handed.

In particular, they have asked authotrites why - if Dotcom was deemed dangerous enough to warrant an airborne and armed raid - why participating officers were not wearing full armed response clothing and body armour.

In court footage also on the 3News/YouTube clip, an unnamed and unidentified officer involved in the raid said the lack of full protective kit was a response to the 'low threat' posed by Dotcom and his house guests.  

Dotcom was one of four men arrested during the operation.

He is accused of being the ringleader of a group that 
netted $175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music, films 
and other copyrighted content without authorisation. Dotcom's lawyers say the company simply offered online storage.

In June Justice
Helen Winkelmann ruled that 
the warrants used in the seizure of property from Dotcom's mansion near 
Auckland were illegal. The judge also ruled that moves by the FBI to copy data from Dotcom's
computer and take it offshore were unlawful.

Dotcom
is on bail in New Zealand, fighting attempts by U.S. authorities 
seeking to extradite him on charges of copyright theft and money 
laundering.

Before
it was shut down in January, Megaupload was one of the world's most 
popular websites, where millions of users stored data, either for free 
or by paying for premium service.

Authorities say Megaupload.com and related sites cheated copyright holders out of more than $500million.

U.S.
lawyers for Megaupload have also argued that American federal 
authorities cannot charge the company with criminal behaviour because it
is Hong Kong-based, and also that no papers have ever been formally 
served.
