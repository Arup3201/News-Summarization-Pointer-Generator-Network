Shocking surveillance video from the day before Robyn Gardner disappeared in Aruba shows her being led by the prime suspect to the stretch of beach from which she would vanish a day later.

Fresh evidence shows the pair clearly visiting the same area, in what experts believe could have been a test run before she was murdered.

Giordano, 50, is the only suspect being questioned in relation to the
disappearance of Gardner, 35, who has been missing since August 2. The older man, who she is thought to have met on an online swingers website, is being held in custody for 60 days, but police need
more evidence to charge him with murder.

The footage shows the Toyota Rav-4 which the pair had rented parked in the same spot it would be left on the day of Robyn's disappearance.

Other shots show them walking near the restaurant where they shared their last meal on the following day. The video was taken at 3.41pm, around the same time of day she vanished a day later.Â 

Legal analyst Dan Abrams told ABC News the footage may show a test run.

'You've also got the possibility now that he may have been casing it the day before so all of these pieces together are going to lead investigators in their minds to believe they have a right guy,' he said.

Last week it emerged that police in 
Aruba are searching for the drivers of a particular white car they 
believe could provide the testimony that helps charge Giordano with the 
killing of Miss Gardner.

Officers
have released the security camera image of the small white car driving 
away from where the missing 35-year-old was last seen in the hopes of 
finding more witnesses.

Prosecutors said the driver or passengers in the Hyundai Getz may have seen the missing woman or the suspect in her presumed death.

They said the photo was taken at 5:59 near to where the Gaithersburg, Maryland, man claims Miss Gardner was swept out to sea while they were snorkelling on August 2.

Memory: Aruba prosecutors describe these as 'the last known photos of the woman and the suspect' taken on the day the Maryland woman went missing

The vehicle was being driven north between the Rum Reef Restaurant and the sea.

Officers believe the people inside may have seen the Toyota RAV4 that Giordano and Ms Gardner were using during their trip to the island.

Officers
having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms 
Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him 
in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees.

Video shows the pair at the Rum Beef Bar & Grill in the Baby Beach area of the island where Ms Gardner went missing.

Restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate.

Key witnesses? Police are trying to trace the people in this white car seen close to where Robyn Gardner disappeared

Giordano initially assisted the search but 
was detained at the airport as he tried to leave the country because of 
questions about his account of what happened.

He has since been ordered to be detained for at least 60 more days while prosecutors seek 
more evidence against him.

Friends said the couple had met on a swingers sex website.
