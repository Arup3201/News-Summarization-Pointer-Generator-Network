If America are to topple Europe then someone may need to produce the kind of extraordinary performance Larry Nelson mustered 35 years ago.

It was 1979 when the Vietnam war veteran and eventual three-time major winner won all five points in a Ryder Cup match, a feat that no other man in history, not even Ian Poulter, has been able to emulate.

Nelson was a rookie and had never even experienced matchplay golf before that match at the Greenbrier in West Virginia, where he took down Seve Ballesteros four times in three days with the Spaniard at his peak.

Nelson, now 67, is the only Ryder Cup player to have won all five points at the tournament 

Speaking on Thursday from California’s Pebble Beach, Nelson, now 67, talked of his admiration for Poulter and how he believes the relatively humble beginnings they share is connected with them achieving great things in the team competition. 

‘It’s probably not coincidence that we come from similar backgrounds,’ said Nelson. ‘He’s more outgoing than I was but we are sort of blue-collar players who came through late, which maybe makes you want it more.’

While Poulter’s rise from the pro shop has been remarkable he has nothing on the story of Nelson, who only took up the game at 21 once he had come back from serving as an infantryman in Vietnam.  

Nelson faced and beat Sever Ballesteros, then considered the world's best player, four times in 1979

Before winning two USPGAs and a US Open, Nelson made his name at the 1979 Ryder Cup, where he and Lanny Wadkins beat Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido three times in four-man competition before he beat the Spaniard again in the Sunday singles.

‘I was a squadron leader in Vietnam and the teamwork and camaraderie aspect came very naturally. That also put the pressure of sport into perspective. After being in the army I was always just happy to see the sun rise in the morning.’ 

There was no other magic secret to his performance for the 5-0 whitewash, which he followed up with a 4-0 in the event two years later.

The US team won 1979's Ryder Cup 17-11:  Back row, standing, left to right - Tom Kite, Mark Hayes, Lee Elder, Lee Trevino, Billy Casper (captain), Andy Bean, Hale Irwin, Gil Morgan; front row - John Mahaffey, Larry Nelson, Lanny Wadkins, Fuzzy Zoeller and Hubert Green

Nelson went on to win three majors, including this 1983 US Open, but made his name first in the Ryder Cup

‘It was almost like playing the 18th hole of a major on every hole and that helped my concentration I guess. 

‘Because I didn’t go to college, matchplay was new to me, but my military background helped,’ he said.

‘I kept getting drawn against Seve, who was about the world’s best at that time. Some were intimidated by him but it wasn’t a problem, I was not even intimidated by (Jack) Nicklaus.

‘I heard things like Seve might try and psyche me out or put me off but there was no animosity. We actually became quite close after.’ 

Nelson has continued to play on the PGA Seniors Tour and will be competing this week. But he added: ‘I will be watching, I still love the Ryder Cup. Europe are supposed to win, but neither side will think of that once it starts.’

Nelson draws parallels between himself and Europe's Ian Poulter, who excels in the Cup's team environment
