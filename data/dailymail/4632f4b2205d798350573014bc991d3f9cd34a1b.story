Mr John Ward, 50, turned up at hospital expecting minor surgery on his thumb when a plastic surgeon told him he  needed surgery for cancer on his nose

A patient going into hospital thinking he was scheduled to have a thumb operation was shocked to discover he had cancer.

John Ward, 50, went to Blackpool Victoria Hospital in July to sign permission forms for the procedure to remove a lump developed on his thumb.

But a mix-up meant he turned up to the appointment and was told by a consultant the operation was to remove the skin cancer on his nose.

Mr Ward thought the mole on his nose, which he didn't believe to be cancerous, had been dealt with when it was cut out in April and claims he wasn't told it was being sent off for a biopsy.

When he arrived at the hospital expecting minor surgery on his thumb, he was given the news that he needed surgery to remove a rodent ulcer, a form of cancer which if left for years, can eventually erode the skin.

‘The surgeon just kept on saying he was going to remove the cancer,’ Mr Ward said.

‘I told him I didn't know what he was talking about.’

‘I couldn't cope with it; it was a shock. I told him to stop saying the word cancer and just said I had to leave. It pushed me over the edge.’

He left in shock without receiving any treatment, but says he has now has lost trust in the doctors charged with treating him.

‘I left without having any procedure,' he said. 'And I'm still waiting to hear from them about any treatment I need.

‘Now I just don't trust them and I don't want them touching my nose.’ he added.

Former construction worker Mr Ward, from Bispham, Lancashire, said he previously asked for the mole, which had developed six years earlier, to be removed when it became itchy.

He complained   to Virgin Healthcare, responsible for dermatology care at the hospital, and was told a letter was sent to his home informing him about the cancerous growth.

Mr Ward claims he never received the letter, which he was told made reference to a ‘skin cancer meeting’.

Virgin Healthcare, who run dermatology services at Blackpool Victoria Hospital (pictured above) where Mr Ward was treated, said they sent him a letter informing him about a 'skin cancer meeting', but Mr Ward claims he never received it and wasn't contacted about the cancer by any other means

He said he felt disappointed he wasn't contacted as a matter of urgency. 

‘No-one phoned me about this or called me in at all,’ he said, adding he would have acted immediately had he received the letter.

‘I had an appointment with [my dermatologist] two days after this letter was meant to have been sent, and he didn't mention the fact that I had cancer at all.’

A spokesperson for the Blackpool Dermatology Service said: ‘We are unable to comment on the specifics of Mr Ward's case, however, all biopsies are sent for pathology assessment in line with clinical best practice.

‘Following pathology testing we update all patients on their results in the most appropriate way depending on the specifics of their condition.

‘Any patients who are found to have a cancerous growth on their skin, that is a squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, are informed personally by a clinician in safest, quickest and most sensitive way possible.’

Virgin Healthcare was unable to confirm whether Mr Ward had been contacted about the cancer ahead of the letter. 

Blackpool Victoria Hospital told MailOnline all dermatology services on their premises are operated by Virgin Healthcare.  

There are two main types of skin cancer, melanoma and non-melanoma.

A basal skin carcinoma is a non-melanoma skin cancer, and is the most common form of the disease.

It accounts for 80 per cent of all cases in the UK.The cancer is often refered to as 'rodent ulcers'.

The commonest cause of a basal cell carcinoma is too much exposure to UV light from the sun or sunbeds. 

There are two types of skin cancer, pictured, melanoma and non-melanoma

They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common in areas exposed to the sun, including your face, head, neck and ears.BCC mainly affect fair-skinned adults and are more common in men than women.

Those at highest risk are:

Most are painless, and often first appear as a scab that bleeds and does not fully heal.

Some BCCs are very superficial and look like a scaly red flat mark, others have a pearl-like rim surrounding a central crater.

If left for years, the latter, can erode the skin causing an ulcer. BCCs can be cured in almost every case.
