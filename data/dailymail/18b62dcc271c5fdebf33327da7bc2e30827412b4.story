A pregnant mother who spent weeks in a coma after she suffered 50 fractures following a serious road accident is miraculously walking again.

Shelli Eldredge, 40, of South Jordan, Utah, was left wrapped around a pole after a moped accident while on holiday with her family in Hawaii in June.

Her legs and hips were seriously disfigured and she miscarried her baby after shattering her pelvis, fracturing her skull and falling into a coma.

Recovered: Shelli Eldredge, 40, of Utah, was left wrapped around a pole after a moped accident while on holiday with her family in Hawaii in June

In hospital: Her legs and hips were seriously disfigured and she miscarried her baby after shattering her pelvis, fracturing her skull and falling into a coma

Her heart had stopped beating by the time she got to hospital and she had thousands of small strokes in her brain, reported the Salt Lake Tribune.

‘It became pretty apparent she wasn't going to wake up,’ her husband, a physician, told MSNBC. ‘Our whole worlds had been turned upside-down.’

But Stephen Eldredge, 50, a Mormon like her, refused when a doctor recommended that her life support should be turned off.

Then a turning point came when Dr Elie Elovic walked from her right to left side and was amazed as she tracked his movement.

Husband and wife: She had only married Stephen Eldredge six months before - and he refused to turn off life support when recommended to do so

Soon after Mr Eldredge told her a 
joke and she laughed by raising her eyebrows - before she started to 
speak and move in the following days.

'My doctors were so great - they were so good. But, everyone, even the doctor said: "She doesn't have a chance of coming back"'

She still needs a wheelchair to move around but she can stand up and walk - and now wants to be able to walk without any help.

‘I don't remember being in Hawaii at 
all in the hospital,’ she told MSNBC. ‘Once I got back and woke up from 
the coma I remembered that.

'My doctors were so great - they were so good. But, everyone, even the doctor said: "She doesn't have a chance of coming back".'

She had only married Mr Eldredge just six months before the incident and they had been to Hawaii on holiday in the past.

’It was very disheartening to face the possibility or likely possibility of her never being able to wake up or function,’ Mr Eldredge told MSNBC.

But after 17 surgeries in just two months, she is expected to make a full recovery, reported the Salt Lake Tribune.

Mrs Eldredge has now finished speech therapy and has three two-hour occupational and physical therapy sessions every week.

‘She’s a lot stronger than I thought she was,’ her son Jordan told MSNBC. ‘She's pulled through a lot of stuff.’
