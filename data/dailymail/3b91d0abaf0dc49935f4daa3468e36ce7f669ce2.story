El Salvador players and fans were left bemused ahead of their friendly against Argentina when, instead of pumping out their national anthem, the stadium's sound system instead played the anthem of Kazakhstan.

The Central American minnows, ranked 89th in the world by FIFA, were facing the World Cup runners-up at Washington DC's FedEx Field on Saturday but their large travelling support were unimpressed as the stadium DJ's mistake became apparent ahead of kick-off.

Rather than the familiar 'Himno Nacional de El Salvador', staff at the stadium which usually hosts the NFL's Washington Redskins played out 'Menin Qazaqstanim'.

El Salvador (5-4-1): Carillo; Flores, Mendoza, Molina, Renderos (Ceren 88), Larin; Alvarez, Ceren, Menjivar (Punyed 76), Alas (Santamaría 67); Bonilla (Burgos 59)    

Argentina (4-2-3-1): Guzman; Zabaleta, Musacchio, Funes Mori, Orban; Pereyra, Banega; Di Maria (Mancuello 73), Lavezzi, Tevez (Pastore 78); Higuain 

Scorers: Renderos OG 54, Mancuello 88  

The players stood out on the pitch, with their hands across their chests looked confused at first, before becoming increasingly frustrated as boos rang out on to the field.

The supporters - who had prepared a 'Vamos Selecta, Houston' flag to be carried over the crowd - reacted furiously. Washington is home to one of the largest Salvadoran communities outside of Central America and their followers outnumbered the Argentine support.

To make things worse, El Salvador fell to an expected defeat against an Argentina side who left out Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero.

The distance from El Salvador to Kazakhstan is 7,909 miles, a fairly big mistake for the stadium staff to make

Lionel Messi was not required by Argentina in their 2-0 win, and neither was Manchester City's Sergio Aguero

Gerardo Martino's side dominated the game and took the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Nestor Renderos own goal deflected from Ever Banega's shot.    

Substitute Federico Mancuello then made sure of the win with a free kick from a tight angle on 88 minutes.

Let us salute, the Motherland, proudly,

To be its children, called we can,

And let us swear our lives spiritedly,

Without rest to its good, consecrate!

Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness,

El Salvador always nobly dreamed.

To achieve this has been her eternal proposition,

To keep it, Her greatest glory.

With inviolable faith, the path of progress,

She strives to follow,

To fulfill her great destiny,

And conquer a happy future.

A stern barrier protects her,

Against the clash of vile disloyalty,

Ever since the day when her soaring flag,

Wrote Freedom with it's blood.

Translated from Spanish

Golden sun in the skies,

Golden seed in the steps,

Legend of courage,

Take a look at my country!

From the antiquity our heroic glory emerged,

They did not give up their honour,

My Kazakh people are strong!

The way was opened to the descendants,

By the vast land I have.

Its unity is proper,

I have an independent country,

It welcomed the tests of time,

Like an eternal friend,

Our country is blessed,

Our country is such! 

Translated from Kazakh
