A grief-stricken Michigan State star Adreian Payne took to Twitter Wednesday afternoon to mourn the loss of his 8-year-old friend, Lacey Holsworth, who has passed away after a long battle with cancer.

The little girl, from St. Johns, Michigan, died Tuesday night after battling neuroblastoma, a form of childhood cancer, for three years.

'Words can't express how much I already miss Lacey,' Payne wrote on Instagram. 'She is my sister, and will always be a part of my life.

Spartans appears on court with Lacey Holsworth, an 8-year-old from St. 
Johns Michigan who passed away from a rare childhood cancer on Tuesday

Brother and sister: Payne, 23, credited Lacey with teaching him how to face life's challenges with a smile and how to be a better man

Loved: Her family released this image of Lacey on Tuesday night, along with a message that she had passed

The
 heart-rending post went on to say that Lacey had taught the 6-foot-10, 23-year-old basketball 
star how to fight through life’s challenges with a smile.

Payne added that he is a better man now because of the little girl with a smile that made America fall in love with her. 

'I know she's smiling and dancing in heaven right now,' Payne concluded. 'My princess is now an angel.'

A
 few hours later, Payne tweeted to his 60,000 followers: 'It was time 
for my lil princess to go home & feel no more pain,now she's happy 
& she's my angel watching over me.'

MSU coach Tom Izzo said he spoke to Payne about the tragic news this morning and told the Detroit Free Press: 'The impact on all of us will be lasting, and that's especially true for Adreian.'

'I'm so proud of Adreian for what he did to help that girl these last couple of years,' he added to Michigan's Big Show. 'He gave her a lifetime of memories and she gave us a lifetime of memories... She made life better for us.'

Izzo added that even though the team knew Lacey's death was 'inevitable', Adreian is still struggling.

'But he took it with the class and dignity that she taught him,' he said. 'I told him, "Not everybody gets to touch somebody’s life like you have. And sometimes other people impact your life, too."'

After the announcement, MSU guard Gary 
Harris and former player Brandon Wood paid tribute to Lacey on Twitter.

Lacey's cancer was thought to have been beaten last summer but it returned last fall.

She had suffered a seizure two weeks ago but was able to travel to watch her team play in the NCAA tournament in New York and cheered on Payne in a college slam dunk contest last week in Texas, the Free Press reported.

Close: The duo met two years ago when MSU went to visit children at the hospital Lacey was being treated

Friends: The duo reportedly messaged every day and Adreian has attended fundraisers for Lacey

The basketball player, 23, had become 
an ardent cheerleader for Lacey after they met two years in Lansing's 
Sparrow Hospital a month after Lacey was diagnosed with neuroblastoma.

Doctors discovered that she had two tumors - one in her abdomen roughly the size of a football and another wrapped around her spine, according to her fundraising page.

Within days, the tumors had left her 
paralyzed and her family was warned that she might just have two weeks 
to live - but after chemotherapy, the spinal tumor dissolved to soft 
tissue.

A month later, the 
Michigan State Basketball team visited the hospital and met Lacey, and 
Adreian stayed behind to talk with Lacey more.

They struck up a friendship, enjoy drawing together and text every day, according to reports. He also joined her family at a fundraiser for Lacey last month.

Condolences: MSU players expressed their sadness over the news of Lacey's death on Twitter

Supporters: Lacey is pictured with her parents and three brothers at an MSU game just weeks ago

'There's days where the smiles don't come 
as easily,' her mother Heather said in a previous interview. 'When he can walk in the room and you see her just light up like 
that, it means everything.'

When his team won the Big Ten 
Tournament Championship last month, he was pictured carrying Lacey in his arms
 as he was honored, and asked her to help him cut the net following the game.

'Lacey is my special friend and she's a good sister to me,' he told BTN. 'She has taught me to fight through everything, to always have a smile on my face even when things are wrong.'

He called her Princess Lacey.

'Adreian's my brother,' she had said. 'I just think of him and I smile.'

Support: Lacey was first diagnosed with cancer 
in 2011 and doctors found two huge tumors inside her

Family: Lacey, from St Johns, Michigan, had called the 6 ft 10 MSU senior her 'big brother'

Payne is not unaccustomed to struggle;
 his mother passed away in his arms when he was 13 after a sever 
asthmatic attack as he desperately searched for her inhaler, the Detroit Free Press reported.

After her death, his grandmother became his legal guardian but she passed away two years ago from respiratory failure due to asthma 
complications.

He has also battled breathing issues due to small lungs, but he has learned to take smaller breaths.

'It
 can't be all about you,' Payne said. 'That’s true with your teammates. 
What can you do to help make them better? And it’s true with others you 
meet.

'It's more important to have a role in other people's lives that you care for.'

By his side: Lacey joined Payne as he cut down the net after the Big Ten championship last month

Together: Payne had said he wanted to bring Lacey happiness so she could forget her pain for a little while

He said that as soon as he met Lacey, he was touched by her fighting spirit.

'She calls me her "Superman", but 
she’s the one who's got the super strength,' Payne said. 'And if I can 
bring her a little bit of happiness to help her forget everything for a 
little while, then that’s what I want to do.'
