A photographer from Victoria, British Columbia, has released a series of images of her friend's C-section in the hopes of demonstrating to the world that the taboo procedure can be a 'peaceful and joyful' experience for both mother and baby.

While Jessica Bender, who specializes in maternity photography, had previously documented two natural births, she had never before been given an opportunity to capture a C-Section. So when her friend Carly asked whether she - and her camera - would be present in the delivery room, Jessica leapt at the chance.

It was, she says, an unforgettable experience.

'It was very special': While she has previously had the opportunity to document two natural births, this was the first C-section that Jessica had witnessed

'I could not take my eyes off the surgery site,' she told the Huffington Post. 'There were moments where I almost forgot to take pictures, because I was so caught up in the amazingness of it all. 

'I've never witnessed any kind of surgery, and this has got to be the best kind out there, so it was very special.'

The photographer captured every aspect of the birth from the procedure itself right up until the moment when Carly and her family were first introduced to the newborn baby boy, named Elias.

And while she has had plenty of experience in the delivery room in the past - both during the births of her own two children and while photographing the births of others - the mother-of-two confessed she knew next to nothing about the reality of the C-section procedure before observing Carly's surgery.

Jessica admits that the experience enabled her to see a completely new side to the procedure and she is eager to demonstrate that C-sections are not always the scary and painful nightmares that they are often described as.

'Most women find themselves with a C-section delivery after not being able to progress with a vaginal delivery, and of course that does bring fear,' she said. 

'But I would challenge them to leave that, and any feelings of 'failure' at the operating room door. I'd tell them to greet their baby as they would have if the birth plan had gone exactly the way they had envisioned it. 

'C-sections are beautiful too. It is still a family, meeting their baby, it’s a miracle.' 

'It's a miracle': Jessica was honored to be a part of such a special moment 

Healthy and happy: Whether you give birth through a natural birth or a C-section, the photographer wants parents to embrace the experience

Happy families: Carly, husband Nathan and their son Elias are loving life together as a family
