Along with starring in The Superbowl and her Pieces Of Me stage show at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas this year, Britney Spears has also unveiled another new lingerie collection.

The busy 33-year-old singer launched the Intimate Collection line with pictures of her posing in the racy white underwear design - as well as a sexy black swimwear number.

The star teased her 40.8 million Twitter followers with images from new collection saying: 'New season, new sets! Here's my entire Spring/Summer 2015 collection :)'

Just like a LBD is a renowned wardrobe staple, a little black costume is a must-have for your swimwear collection. So kudos to Britney Spears for including one in her new Spring/Summer range!

Along with some gorgeously decadent underwear which we can't wait to get our hands on, comes this staple swimwear design featuring a flattering cut, sexy plunge front and luxe-looking gold clasp.

It's versatile enough to pack for whatever jaunt you're going on, be it a romantic getaway, or a cray cray weekend with the girls. Plus, although it's a basic design, that low-cut front provides just the right amount of sexy undertone.

Keep an eye on Brit's website as this cool costume is about to drop any day now. But if you can't wait, then check out our edit of lookalikes below. Our favorite? This Norma Kamali number is a must-have.

She also introduced the new range to her 4.1 million Instagram followers with a slide show showcasing her new designs.

The images see Britney model a mainly pastel-coloured range to complement the Spring/Summer brief.

The new line also sees the mother-of-two introduce swimwear to her repertoire as she models a two-piece set while lazing in a swimming pool on a lilo in a plunging colourful one-piece.

The collection sees the Toxic singer showcase an enviable figure that she has been careful to maintain while performing on stage in Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas strip.  

The entrepreneur, who also has a perfume collection, releasing 16 perfumes through Elizabeth Arden, unveiled her current collection earlier this month.   

The singer announced the release to her combined 44.8 million social media followers with a revealing look from the sexy ad campaign.

Britney was pictured wearing a satin black brassiere and sheer lace briefs that put her toned figure on display, accessorising with a floaty fur-trimmed wrap and pointy high heels.

'Here it is as promised! New collection #Elvira from @IntimateBritney will be on sale next week!' Britney gushed on Twitter on February 5.

She also alerted her followers on Instagram to the launch by posting the same photo and writing: 'New collection #Elvira from @intimatebritneyspears will be on sale next week!'

The star has been keeping in great shape for her Pieces of Me stage show in Las Vegas 

Earlier that week, Britney had shared another image from the collection that showed her posing in pink lingerie.

'May I introduce to you #Elma for @intimatebritneyspears, the first pieces of many in the SS15 collection. Coming soon!'

Britney originally teased her total of 44.8M social media followers with another look at her new Spring/Summer Intimate Collection earlier this month 

Britney - who soared to fame in 1999 with the help of music video Baby One More Time - certainly knows how to promote interest by now.

The pop princess announced plans to launch the lingerie line in summer of 2014, and it is already selling in more than 200 countries. 

The star's current collection is available online now, however it remains unclear when her new one will become available.
