Thousands of mourners - including both the Colombian and Mexican presidents - gathered in New Mexico to bid a final farewell to beloved author and Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

The Colombian-born author, who died on Thursday aged 87, lived in Mexico for decades and wrote some of his best-known works in the country, including One Hundred Years of Solitude.

A mile-long line of mourners waited outside Mexico City's majestic Palace of Fine Art long into the night to farewell 'Gabo', as Mr Garcia Marquez was known in Latin America.

Mexican
 President Enrique Pena Nieto said the death was ‘a great loss not only 
for literature but for humanity. Various generations found answers to 
the questions of life in his stories and tales.’

Praised: Colombian-born Gabriel Garcia Marquez, widely considered one of the greatest Spanish-language writers of all time, was honoured in his second home-country, Mexico, on Monday

Mr Garcia Marquez, widely considered 
one of the greatest Spanish-language authors of all time was eulogized 
in the dramatic art deco lobby by the presidents of both Mexico and 
Colombia, two countries linked by the writer through his birth, life, 
heritage and career.

‘We come as admirers and friends of Gabo from all corners of the planet,’ Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said.

‘He will live on in his books and writings. But more than anything he will live forever in the hopes of humanity.’

At
 the end, attendees tossed up a flurry of yellow paper butterflies, one 
of Garcia Marquez's most famous literary images from One Hundred Years 
of Solitude, and his favorite color.

Thousands passed by the simple urn holding his ashes during a three-hour tribute open to the public Monday afternoon.

When
 the procession was closed for the ceremony, a crowd remained outside 
demanding to pay respects to Mr Garcia Marquez, who won the Nobel prize 
in 1982.

After the eulogies, the building was reopened and the procession resumed.

‘Gabo
 was a watershed in my life,’ said Nelly Hernandez, a 52-year-old 
teacher holding a pair of yellow paper butterflies. ‘He taught me to 
relish life through literature.’

Before
 the formal ceremony, applause thundered for several minutes after Mr 
Garcia Marquez's ashes were placed on a black pedestal by his widow, 
Mercedes Barcha, and his two sons, Gonzalo and Rodrigo. Dignitaries, 
friends and artists took turns as honour guards.

A
 quartet played some of Mr Garcia Marquez's favourite classical composers, 
including Hungary's Bela Bartok and Italy's Giovanni Bottesini.

A
 musical trio passed in front of the urn to play upbeat, accordion-laced
 vallenato, the music native to Colombia's Caribbean coast where Mr Garcia 
Marquez grew up.

He once said One Hundred Years of Solitude was a vallenato of 400 pages.

‘This
 is my chance to accompany Garcia Marquez,’ said Lorena Moreno, 40, 
originally from Barranquilla, Colombia, where the author spent part of 
his early years. A resident of Mexico for seven years, she said that 
whenever she is homesick for her country, she rereads Garcia Marquez's 
work.

The writer's birthplace in Colombia, Aracataca, held a symbolic funeral Monday.

About
 3,000 people joined in a procession that started at his childhood home,
 now a museum dedicated to his life and work, and went to the church in 
the centre of town, then to the town cemetery and back to the museum. 
They carried hundreds of yellow flowers and yellow paper butterflies.

Mr Garcia
 Marquez's family has not said what will do with his ashes. Colombia has
 said it would like at least some of the ashes to go to his homeland.

‘Aracataca
 gave so much to Gabito ... that we want some of his ashes to be here,’ 
said Jorge Polo Camargo, head of protocol in the town.
