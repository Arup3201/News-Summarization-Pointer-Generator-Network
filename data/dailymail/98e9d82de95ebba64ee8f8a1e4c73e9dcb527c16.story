Shot dead: Dana Miller (pictured) was killed last month in a murder-suicide when her 'depressed' husband Jeffrey shot her dead and then turned the gun on himself at their Jackson Township, Pennsylvania home

Police believe a man who suffered from a flesh-eating disease called 911 after shooting his wife last month, and then turned the gun on himself in a tragic murder suicide carried out in the midst of their bitter divorce.

Jeffrey A Miller, 52, and his 47-year-old wife Dana W Miller were found shot to death in their Jackson Township, Pennsylvania home the evening of August 6 by their 18-year-old son Jeffrey Miller Jr.

Friends say the couple, who had been married for 20 years and shared three teenage children, had separated in recent months due to issues surrounding Jeffrey's depression.

Dana's friend Melanie Holscher says the Miller's relationship deteriorated in recent years, after her husband developed a life-threatening flesh-eating disease which aggravated his depression.

'It just got worse throughout the years and especially after the flesh-eating disease, but she was in there trying to provide a good home for her family and kids,' Holscher told WTAE.

The couple were in the process of selling the home they shared on 300 Evans Road, when Jeffrey called his wife over to the house the afternoon of August 6, saying a potential buyer was stopping by and he wanted her to be there for the showing.

That's when Jeffrey reportedly shot his wife several times, with a 9mm handgun that was registered in her own name.

Police received an ominous phone call just before 5:45pm, from an anonymous caller they believe to be Jeffrey, reporting gun shots nears the address.

Son Jeffrey Miller Jr arrived at the home to hear the final shot, and walked into the house to find both of his parents dead.

Police say Dana Miller suffered several gunshot wounds while her husband was shot once in the head.

There was no sign of struggle, police said.

Local police added that they had been called to the home more than a half-dozen times since January, for domestic disputes mostly over personal property, police Chief Terry Seilhamer said. 

Lured: Jeffrey Miller allegedly called his wife the afternoon of August 6, and told her to come over to the home they were selling since a potential buyer was stopping by to see the house

One of those incidents turned violent, and Jeffrey went on to obtain a protective order against his wife, claiming she hit him over the head with an Xbox console.

But Dana's friends and family say she was the victim of abuse, and that her estranged husband made up the claims to stop her from getting a restraining order herself.

'Dana did everything for him,' her mother Carol Wilson of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina said. 'He wasn't going to let anyone else have her.'

At the time of her death, Dana was free on bond awaiting an August 26 hearing in which he was expected to have the charges dropped since she attended counseling sessions.

He eventually dropped the retraining order on May 27, when she moved out of their home and into another house in Cranberry Township with their 15-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter. Eighteen-year-old Jeffrey Miller Jr remained at home with his father.
