It seems some people will do anything for a freebie - and that includes blackmail.

Restaurant, hotel and B&B owners across the UK have reported a huge rise in the number of customers who use TripAdvisor as a threat.

Chancers are telling staff they will post bad comments on the review site if they don't get better service, meals or upgrades.

Bad reviews: Guests are threatening hotel and restaurant owners for free meals and stays

Caterers say the scammers often make a complaint and say if they don't get a free bottle of wine or dessert or a bill reduction they'll post a bad review.

Other 'gastronomic blackmailers' claim they even work for TripAdvisor and will post a series of negative comments unless they get free upgrades.

Martin Couchman, deputy chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said he is in talks with TripAdvisor to improve the service.

He said: 'People threatening restaurants and hotels with bad TripAdvisor reviews to extort free things is a problem which has been growing.

'While it's very difficult to put an exact figure on how widespread the problem is, it is clear that small minority of online reviewers are directly blackmailing - or sometimes subtly blackmailing - restaurants for their own gain.

'People will either attempt to blackmail during the meal, or sometimes, more worryingly, people who have not even been to the restaurant will post a bad review to try and get a free meal, or a free stay in a hotel's case.

'While it can be difficult to prove that somebody has blackmailed you, we would advise that business owners do not respond - or make free offers - to reviewers they suspect are malicious.

'Instead, take the matter to Trip Advisor, as they do work hard to keep malicious and inaccurate reviews off the site. And if you're still having problems - get in touch with us.'

Steak house owner Craig Savage, 49, fears restaurateurs across the UK are being hit by people who are jeopardising business reputations to get a free lunch.

Craig claims around 30 meals out of the 1,000 he serves in his restaurant every week will be to malicious customers, who threaten bad reviews unless they get a freebie.

Craig, who runs the Double Barrel Real Steakhouse and Grill in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, with partner Sarah Bird, 33, said: 'What usually happens is that a customer will come to the bar, or say to the waiting staff, "I am a senior TripAdvisor reviewer" and then you know that something will definitely go wrong.'

Under normal circumstances, when a customer is not happy, Craig would offer to knock money off the bill, give them a free bottle of wine, or a dessert.

'But what we are finding is that these so called reviewers will complain about the meal or the service and when you ask how to put it right, you can guarantee it will be some sort of freebie,' said Craig.

'But that's all they're after - something for free, and it just isn't right.

'And it's not just our restaurant that's being affected, every restaurant owner I speak to is concerned about this phenomenon.'

Another concern for the couple is people posting malicious reviews on to the website without even going to the restaurant.

Craig said: 'To begin with, when somebody posted a really bad review about us on TripAdvisor we would reply back to them, apologise and offer them a free meal or something.

'But what we noticed was that some of the reviewers clearly had not even been to the restaurant and were just posting the review to blag a free meal out of us.

'One such reviewer went on about how the tables in the restaurant were really old on the week we had just had them replaced.

'TripAdvisor is essential to business owners because it's probably the first place people check to see if a restaurant's good or not.

'But these malicious customers know that - and they realise they can use it to their advantage.'

A spokesman for TripAdvisor said: 'Allegations of blackmail or threatening behaviour by guests against property owners are taken very seriously.

'If an owner experiences this, we urge them to contact us immediately. We have a way for owners to proactively report threats before a corresponding review is submitted.

'Immediate reporting of blackmail threats, via our Management Centre, which every owner can register on for free, can help us keep blackmail reviews from ever reaching the site.'
