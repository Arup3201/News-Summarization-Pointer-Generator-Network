Brainstorming meetings are usually considered a great way to come up with ideas.

But a new paper says they're actually a less-effective way of generating quality suggestions than a more-focussed alternative, known as creative design reasoning

The study found that generating a lot of ideas in the hope that ‘quantity breeds quality’ doesn’t actually work.

Does brainstorming really work? Researchers have found that generating lots of ideas in the hope that some turn out good doesn't really work

The paper, ‘Brainstorming versus creative design reasoning,’ is being presented at the Design Computing and Cognition conference in London next month.

In it design theorist Dr Akin Kazakci of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris and three other French researchers studied groups in brainstorming sessions.

‘The major result presented in the current work is the invalidity of QBQ [Quality Breeds Quantity] hypothesis of brainstorming,’ they write.

In the study Dr Kazakci split 30 designers up into ten groups of three.

Scientists from Texas A&M University carried out experiments into the value of brainstorming.

Individual students and groups were asked to come up with as
 many ideas as they could on how to improve the university.

This
 showed that four individual students generated up to 44 per cent more 
ideas and covered a wider range of topics than a four in a group 
together.

This showed that groups were worse as people fixated on the same ideas.

They concluded that it might be more productive to work individually.

‘The 30 participants were all either engineering designers or industrial designerswith an average of 12 years of professional experience in R&D and innovation,’ according to the researchers.   

Each team was then tasked to devise ‘a breakthrough museumconcept that gives the visitor an immersive experience in an Antarctica-likeworld’, a task that was purposefully ambiguous.

There were a number of additional requirements, such as the museum having to be mobile and eco-friendly.

Each team had 90 minutes to come up with their museum idea, summarised in the end on a piece of A3 paper, before presenting their idea to the researchers.

During the ‘brainstorming’ sessions to the conversations of each group were recorded and the researchers counted the number of ‘known’ ideas, such as ‘a museum has an entrance,’ and ‘unknown ideas,’ like imagining ‘a museum that is a zeppelin.’

In the study the ten teams were asked to design museums that focused on Antarctica, with a few requirements including the museum being mobile, but otherwise they were left to their own devices

A panel of 14 professionals, a mixture of museum experts and project managers, who were unaware of the nature of the research were then asked to rate the ten final designs according to novelty, feasibility and value.

They found that, generally, the teams that created the most ideas then suffered in their final design.

Those that generated less had more designs that were more well received by the professionals.

On average each team generated 82 ideas, but the best performing team generated just 60.

‘Thus, we reject QBQ,’ the researchers conclude.
