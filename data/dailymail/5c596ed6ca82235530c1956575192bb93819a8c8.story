If you leave your phone lying around when you leave the room, chances are your partner will take the opportunity to snoop through your texts, emails and internet searches.

According to a new survey, four in ten adults regularly check their partner's device behind their back to keep an eye on them - with women most likely to snoop.

The fairer sex is also the most suspicious with 44 per cent of women admitting to checking their other halves' phones compared to 36 per cent of men.

Researchers also found 34 per cent know their partner's mobile PIN, 39 per cent know their email account password and 26 per cent know their Facebook password.

Some 31 per cent don't know their significant other's PINS or passwords and are happy with that but more than half (54 per cent) would be suspicious if this wasn't the case for them.

In fact, just over half believe sharing your mobile PIN or social media passwords is a modern sign of true love and commitment.

While six in 10 snoops have caught their partner cheating on them or talking to someone they shouldn't be, more than a third have scuppered a romantic surprise their loved one was planning.

The study of 2,000 Britons, commissioned by Samsung, found almost half have gone through a partner's phone in at least one relationship they've been in, with 16 per cent admitting they have done this with pretty much everyone they have been with. 

Furthermore, 40 per cent regularly snoop through their current partner's mobile to keep an eye on what they are doing or who they are talking to.

It doesn't always go to plan though as 34 per cent have ended up ruining a surprise their partner is planning for them, stumbling across their plans for a holiday, weekend away, gift or even a proposal, plus 44 per cent of said snoops have been caught in the act when going through their partner's phone.

Text messages are most likely to be checked, followed by their call history, Facebook private messages, emails and even their photo gallery. Internet history and Twitter conversations are also among the things looked at by suspicious people.

1. Text messages

2. Call history

3. Facebook private messages

4. Emails

5. Photo gallery

6. Internet history

7. WhatsApp history

8. Twitter private messages

9. Viber history

10. Skype history 

But six in 10 of those who snoop have found inappropriate text messages, Facebook messages, phone calls or internet searches on at least one of their partner's mobiles. 

When it comes to confessing about their find, 32 per cent would confront their other half even if it meant owning up to their snooping, while a clever 18 per cent would find a way to bring it up without having to admit how they found out.

Whilst 23 per cent would keep it to themselves, but keep a closer eye on their partner, 17 per cent would try and forget about it as they shouldn't have been snooping in the first place. 

Almost one in 20 would break up with their partner immediately.

While 27 per cent said their other half wasn't bothered, as they had nothing to hide, 40 per cent said they were angry and 24 per cent said they broke up with them there and then. 

The phone company commissioned the research for the new Samsung Galaxy A-Series smartphone range.

A spokesperson for Samsung Electronics UK & Ireland said:

'Rather amusingly this research shows that suspicious partners seem to be using them quite regularly to check up on their other half on a regular basis. 

'As we head towards the Valentine's season however, it's worth bearing in mind that you might discover something your partner is trying to keep hidden for all the right reasons, such as a secret weekend away they are planning, a special gift or perhaps even a marriage proposal!'
