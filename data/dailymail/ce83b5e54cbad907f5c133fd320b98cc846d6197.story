Some of Britain's eeriest underground wonders have been captured by a photographer with an obsession with the deep.

Mike Deere, from Reading, Berkshire, crawls through sewers and mineshafts to snap the haunting images.

He heads to daunting locations such as London's sprawling miles of underground sewers and disused cooling towers, some of which remain almost exactly as they were left when they were abandoned. 

A photographer has captured these eerie images showing the scale of some of Britains deepest darkest wonders - such as the Box Freestone Mine, Wiltshire

Mike Deere, from Reading, Berks, heads to daunting locations such as abandoned mine shafts, London's miles upon miles of sewers and even disused cooling towers - this incredible image was captured by the photographer as he was looking down the ladder of a disused gasometer

Box Freestone Mine, in Wiltshire, has been worked since Roman times, but closed in 1968. Mr Deere said: He said: 'I've long held a fascination with interesting spaces, and the way that we relate to them'

The photographer said some of the seemingly endless tunnels were so dark that even experienced map readers would struggle to navigate their way around.

Due to each tunnel's similarity and the fact it's pitch black it's also extremely difficult to capture his amazing shots.

Some of Mr Deere's best work has come from the now-abandoned Box Freestone Mine, Wiltshire, which ceased operation in 1968.

Before then the mine had been used to extract Bath Stone for the city of Bath's buildings since the Roman occupation of Britain.

The photographer  - pictured here in the sewer network beneath the River Westbourne, London, has come across abandoned cranes, wells, ventilation shafts, work benches, tools and even the rubbish from workers' meals, more than 45 years on

As well as being able to capture the sheer scale of such shaft, Mr Deere and his friends also stumble across many of the original features that still exist in such mines.

Mike Deere said he was inspired by his fascination in abandoned places: 'Ever wondered what people have forgotten about? Or whatÂ¿s in that old derelict house that you walk by everyday? Or what lies just beyond that fence on the brow of the hill? So have I'

'The sheer size of the network can seem a little daunting. To go in there without a map and backup torches and batteries would be suicide.

'Even those that are adept at map reading with heightened spatial awareness can become confused by the maze of endless junctions, dead ends, passages and markings.

'The tunnels I go into are usually completely pitch black. The only light available for photographing with is what little you can carry. With this in mind, I'm happy with the photos I've taken.'
