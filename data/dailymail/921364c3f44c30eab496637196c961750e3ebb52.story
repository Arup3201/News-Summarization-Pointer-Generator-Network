It is the dance craze that refuses to go away.

Everyone from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to Zara Philips has tried their hand at the moves made famous by South Korean rapper PSY in the video for his cult hit Gangnam Style.

Now staff at a Tesco supermarket in Devon are the latest to get in on the act, after filming a festive tribute video featuring hot tub wrestling and a bare-chested Santa Claus alongside those trademark horse-riding moves.

The video, which has been posted on YouTube, features store manager Mike 
Hart and a security guard, played by Kevin Slade, chasing an overweight, semi-naked Santa, on the roof.

Other scenes show Santa, played by Tesco worker Russell Gregg, parading with girls dressed as elves and performing the Gangnam Style dance.

Ryan Martin, 28, who works at the supermarket and directed the video, said the plot was dreamed up during breaks at the store in Barnstaple.

'I’ve had so many people come to me, congratulate me and ask for copies,' he said.

'The response has been really good.'

Meanwhile in London Thames Water's 'singing sewermen' have also released a Gangnam Style video, to encourage people not to wash their turkey fat down the sink this Christmas.

Thames Water was called out to 101 blockages on Christmas day.

Singing sewerman and 'chief flusher' Rob Smith said the video, which features the group showing off their moves in the sewers beneath the capital, was 'a bit of festive fun with a serious message'.
