It is the role no father would wish upon his daughter. But for Bill Roache, who today walked free from court following a trial for sexual assault, having his daughter Verity play the part of his rock and constant supporter for every day of the ordeal no doubt gave him enormous comfort. 

Verity, Roache’s 32-year-old daughter from his marriage to his second wife Sara, hardly left her father's side during the trial at Preston Crown Court.

She was a daily presence, walking shoulder to shoulder with her 81-year-old father, a comforting hand frequently laid on his back.

Rock: Verity Roache, 32, an interior designer, has been by her father's side throughout his trial, which today saw him walk free from allegations of sex crimes dating back to the 1960s

Supporting role: Verity has been a constant presence during the trial, which saw Roache describe himself in the witness box as 'peaceful and gentle', not the 'cold and calculating' man his alleged victims described

On the few occasions widower Roache, who was today cleared of seven sex charges dating back to the 1960s, has been seen out in his hometown of Wilmslow, Cheshire, Verity has been by his side, head held high, unwavering in her support.

A source told the Sun during the case: 'Verity has really been there for her dad. She adores him and has been a tower of strength. As far as he is concerned she is his rock.

'Thanks to her support, he is focused and determined to prove his innocence.'

Roache counted on support not just from Verity, but from his actor sons Linus, 49, from his marriage to Anna Cropper, and James, 27, from Roache's marriage to his second wife, Sara, who died suddenly in 2009 at the age of 58. 

Standing by: On day 12 of the trial Verity offers her father much-needed support

Loyal: Verity never strayed from her father's side in the days of the trial, and even accompanied him on the few outings into town he had over the past month

Close knit: Not just Verity but the whole of the Roache clan were fiercely supportive of their father

Back in 2010, when Roache's sons Linus and James made guest appearances on Coronation Street, the soap in which Roache has starred for more than 50 years, he commented that he would like his daughter Verity to join them.

'My daughter Verity is an interior designer. But we are hoping she will come into the Rovers as an extra,' he said in an interview at the time.

But while Roache's sons have a public profile, Verity's life is rather more private.

She studied History of Art at St Andrew's University in Scotland where she was a friend of Prince William before becoming an interior designer and founder of Abigail & Winston, an upmarket design store listed with an address on Notting Hill's Ledbury Road but registered in Verity's name from a different address in Wilmslow.

Its website is under construction, and little more can be found about the site online. Verity also worked for a time with society interior designer Nicky Haslam.

Quiet life: Verity has a Twitter account but is not a prolific user of the site

Solidarity: Two of the followers of Verity's Twitter account

She has an account on Twitter under the handle @verityroache, illustrated with a background picture of her family some years ago showing a happy scene of Verity as a little girl with her mother and father, and what looks to be her younger brother James. But Verity is not an active user of the site and, while she follows the usual mix of news site accounts and famous names, had at the time of printing only sent out 34 tweets and had 146 followers.

Two of those followers give a glimpse into the ordeal the Roaches have been through over the past few weeks: they are accounts set up to help clear the name of the falsely accused.

Verity is clearly as fiercely loyal as she is private. She remained by her father's side today as he left court, saying he was keen to 'get back to work' as Ken Barlow on Coronation Street.

The actor, who has appeared in the soap since its first episode in 1960, admitted 'there are no winners' after he was cleared of rape and indecent assault at Preston Crown Court.

There were cheers and clapping when the jury unanimously cleared him of all six charges, leaving him open to return to the ITV soap.

Roache always maintained his innocence and blamed hysteria after the Jimmy Savile scandal for 'money-grabbing' women who falsely accused him of sex offences.
