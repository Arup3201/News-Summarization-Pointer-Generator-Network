Olivier Giroud has scored three goals in his last two Premier League games against the Saints.

The Gunners are unbeaten in their last 19 home league games against the Saints (W14 D5).

Arsene Wenger has come up against Ronald Koeman on seven occasions, winning just one match, drawing four and losing two.

Arsenal have been trailing at some point in five of their six Premier League games at the Emirates Stadium this season.

Nathaniel Clyne has found the net in two of this last three appearances against Arsenal at the Emirates, the winner in the Capital One Cup this season and an own goal in a 1-6 defeat in the league in September 2012.

Defeat to Man Utd last time out ended a run of 23 home league games without defeat for the Gunners, but they have now won just one of the last five (W1 D3 L1) at the Emirates in the PL.

Arsenal have attempted more shots (excl. blocked) from outside the box than any other Premier League side this season (70).

Southampton’s three PL defeats this season have all come against sides that finished in the top six of the 2013-14 Premier League table (Man City, Liverpool and Tottenham). Arsenal finished fourth last season.
