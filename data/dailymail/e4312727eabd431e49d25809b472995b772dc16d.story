In May, MailOnline achieved new record traffic highs in the UK, U.S. and the rest of the world for both monthly and daily unique visitors

The award-winning MailOnline
marks two key milestones this month as it continues to set the pace in online
news journalism.

Firstly, in May it achieved
new record traffic highs in the UK, U.S. and the rest of the world for both
monthly and daily unique visitors with a global total of over 77million unique
browsers.

Today it also becomes the first UK newspaper to
publish an ABC audited number of its iPhone app, which revealed that 168,507 people
are accessing MailOnline via its iPhone app.

This app, which so far is
only available in the UK iTunes store, is free for the first 60 days and then
users can choose either to subscribe for £4.99 for six months or £8.99 for a year
or continue to receive the app content for free but with adverts.

The certificate also
revealed the astonishing level of engagement by MailOnline app users. Each app
user viewed an average 62 pages A DAY.

A total of over 315,122 people
have downloaded the app since it was launched last October, showing that on any
given day an astonishing 62,125 of them are returning to it.

No other UK newspaper has
yet published their app traffic through ABCe.

Publisher Martin Clarke
said: 'MailOnline has always sought to publish and audit as much usage
information as possible to allow buyers to really understand our relative daily
scale. 

'We are pleased ABC can now verify
the great engagement our iPhone app has achieved since launching over six months
ago.

'More than 62,000 daily App Unique Browsers are requesting over 3.8million
App Page Impressions on their iPhone mobiles each day. 

'It's vital for publishers to make their usage
stats transparent in this manner to gain the trust of advertisers.

'We are delighted with the
amazing levels of engagement. This shows just what an essential part of
people's lives MailOnline has become and underscores the Mail's commitment to
reach its readers when and where it suits THEM -- be it online, on mobile or in print.

'Our daily iPhone traffic is
currently rising at a steady 10 per cent a month in the UK and we look forward to
rolling out our app in other countries over the next few weeks and months.

'Once again, this development
emphasises that while other publishers talk about having a digital vision of
the future, we are already delivering it.'

The development came in an
astonishing month for MailOnline traffic.

Over 315,122 people have downloaded the MailOnline app since it was launched last October

The website was confirmed by
the latest ABC audited figures as Britain's top newspaper website for the SIXTEENTH
month in a row.

In May, it recorded 4,365,717
visitors every day: 21 per cent higher than in April 2011 and 83 per cent higher than in May 2010.

That's 1,538,039 more
visitors a day than its nearest rival, The Guardian which recorded 2,827,678 visitors
a day, while the Telegraph was on­­­­ ­­­­2,188,745.

Continuing last year's stunning growth, MailOnline
recorded over 77million global unique browsers over
the month.

That represents a 21 per cent increase over April 2011 and an 82 per cent year on
year increase.

Again, that makes MailOnline
the biggest UK newspaper website. The next biggest was the Guardian with 51.38million global unique browsers.

In
the UK, MailOnline was visited by an
average of 1,717,391 UK residents every day, 22 per cent more than in April 2011 and 59 per cent
more than in May 2010.

This also represents a 41 per cent increase over Guardian. Mail
Online had over 25million unique browsers in the UK, an increase of 56 per cent year
on year.

MailOnline also has the highest proportion of UK
page impressions at 61 per cent of its total 780million.

MailOnline also recorded over 28.9million UVs (unique visitors) in
May 2011 from the United States, where it recently opened editorial offices in
New York and Los Angeles.

Meanwhile, figures from Comscore showed MailOnline
dramatically closing the gap with the New York Times in the race to be the
world's biggest newspaper website.

Even more astonishingly, Comscore found that
MailOnline was now the THIRD most visited newspaper website in the United
States behind the NYT and only marginally behind Washington Post.

It is now
bigger in America than the LA Times, USA
Today, the Chicago Tribune and Wall Street Journal.

Meanwhile, according to Hitwise, Mail Online has 34.42 per cent
share of all visits to national UK newspapers.

To round off an amazing month, MailOnline won its
second major award of the year, being named Consumer Website of the Year at the
prestigious AOP awards.
