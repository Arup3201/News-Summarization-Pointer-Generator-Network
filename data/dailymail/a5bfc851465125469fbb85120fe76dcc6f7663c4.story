 

It is the Christmas tree that children could only dream about and the 10-metre spectacular LEGO creation has arrived in Sydney.

The phenomenal design took five people patiently building the tree from scratch with an astounding half a million pieces over 1,200 painstaking hours.

On display outside the Westfield shopping centre on Pitt Street mall, the decorative baubles are the size of basket balls on the tree which is as high as a two-storey house and is wider than a family car.

As if that wasn't magnificent enough - the tree lights flash on and off to the rhythm of the Christmas carols.

LEGO Senior project manager Dale Chasse said it was the biggest things he had ever built.

'It was designed in the U.S. and some of the big challenges with it were it's huge so it wasn't going to be easy for us to build it here in the U.S. and ship it down to Australia because they don't make planes quite big enough for it,' he said. 

'So we worked with a LEGO certified professional in Melbourne - Ryan McNaught and we partnered up with him to do all of the big building and most of the LEGO models around the stage.'

LEGO marketing director, Troy Taylor, said the ambitious idea to build the tree was made in June

'He built all of the big ones which aren't practical to ship halfway around the world - he pulled a team together down there and pulled this stuff off.'

LEGO marketing director, Troy Taylor, said the ambitious idea to build the tree was made in June.

'We decided we wanted to create memorable experiences for kids and families and we thought what a better way to do that than to build a 10-metre high tree made out of LEGO,' he said

'We weren't sure it was possible so we had to liaise with Dale and his team in U.S. and said they could do it and not build it so then when we spoke to Ryan who had to recruit '
