Sixes and fours?: Mrs Justice Beverley Lang, sitting in London, has been a High Court judge since 2011

A planning battle over an old village forge next to a cricket pitch yesterday led to a High Court judge asking: ‘What are sixes and fours?’

East Meon Forge and Cricket Ground Protection Association is challenging East Hampshire District Council’s decision to grant planning permission for an extension with a residential first floor over the single-storey former blacksmith’s workshop.

Robert Fookes, appearing for the association, said that one of the grounds of objection to the development was that the forge was very close to the square on which cricket is played.

He told Mrs Justice Beverley Lang ‘sixes and fours are frequently hit by batsmen on to forge land, including the roof of the building itself’.

However, the baffled 59-year-old judge, sitting at London’s High Court, said: ‘I don’t play cricket - what does that mean?’

Mr Fookes replied that sixes were scored in cricket when the ball was hit over the boundary without hitting the ground, while fours ‘bounced along the ground’ before crossing the boundary line.

He added that six runs or four runs were scored automatically without the batsman having to run the runs.

Mrs Justice Lang made no further comment on the game and the court turned to consider the dimensions of the controversial development in East Meon, in the South Downs National Park.

The judge was educated at Wycombe Abbey School and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she is an honorary fellow. She has been a High Court judge since 2011.

Dispute: East Meon Forge and Cricket Ground Protection Association is challenging a decision to grant planning permission for an extension with a residential first floor over the single-storey former blacksmith’s workshop

Chairman of East Meon Forge and Cricket Ground Protection Association (EMFCPA) George Bartlett said: ‘There are a large number of people in East Meon who have a great attachment to the old forge as an important part of the village’s heritage and feel that the proposed development is a gross over-development on this tiny site and is out of keeping with the surrounding properties in this conservation area.

‘It will cause even greater traffic problems on this narrow and blind bend in the road and will threaten the playing of cricket and other sport on the adjoining cricket ground.’

Mr Fookes told the judge that the brick-built forge with its tiled roof dated back to 1869 and was on Hampshire County Council's list of ‘treasures’, which meant its destruction would be a serious loss to the heritage of the county.

In 2009 English Heritage considered that, while it did not fulfil the criteria for listing for preservation, it was of local importance and should be protected.

Mr Fookes said the planning permission under challenge was granted to the current owners of the forge in April, and was the third application to be made for the site.

He said the first application was subsequently withdrawn. The second was granted in September 2013 for a large extension with a residential first floor over the old blacksmith's workshop.

The proposal raised concerns and was quashed by consent. The third, very similar application was then made and approved by the local planning authority.

Mr Fookes argued that the proposal was contrary to relevant planning policy.

The cricket club, ‘an important village institution’ composed almost entirely of village residents, was also extremely concerned that it could jeopardise the long-term use of the cricket ground.

The forge was at the entrance to the ground and very close to the square on which the wickets were pitched.

As a result sixes and fours were frequently hit on to the forge land, including the roof of the building itself. Mr Fookes argued that this was not a concern while the building remained undeveloped.

But there would be potential for damage and injury to people if an additional storey for residential use were to be built with windows overlooking the ground, as well as roof-lights and an open decked area.

He contended the future of the cricket club would come under threat as it would be liable for any damage to the building and its occupants caused by batsmen hitting balls over the boundary.

David Forsdick QC, appearing for the district council, said the legal challenge should be dismissed. 

He told the judge the council had granted planning permission for alterations to the forge on behalf of the South Downs National Park Authority. 

He said the forge's lawful use was as an industrial building, but it was not in use and was in poor condition.

In essence the approved plan was to secure its future by repairing it and bringing it back into use, with living accommodation on the new first floor.

Steps had been taken to address the cricket club's concerns, said Mr Forsdick. Advice from Sports England had led to an acceptable scheme of conditions to deal with those concerns.

The case continues today.
