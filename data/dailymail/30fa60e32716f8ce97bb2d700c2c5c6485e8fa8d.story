A white van man is getting his hands dirty to create stunning works of art on the side of his unwashed van.

Rick Minns, also known as Ruddy Muddy, has created pictures including winter landscapes, children playing in the snow and a ship on high seas by scraping away the dirt on the side of his van.

The 39-year-old, who works for Norfolk-based floral wholesaler Flowervision, has dubbed his work 'grafilthy' and enjoys entertaining onlookers as he goes about his daily work making deliveries to florists.

Creative: Rick Minns has created his 'grafilthy' artworks on the side of grubby florist vans

Detailed: As his work progressed, the dad-of-three started using cotton buds and tissues to help create different effects and shadows in the grimy Transit vans which are used for his work at a Norfolk-based florist

Fun: The 39-year-old said he started creating the masterpieces as 'just a bit of fun'

He said: 'It just started as a bit of fun while I was at work.

'Work might prefer it if I washed my van more regularly but this is better than me driving around in a boring old dirty van.'

Mr Minns, who has an A-level in art and attends adult art classes, started drawing on the vans using his fingertips.

As his skills developed, he began using cotton buds and tissues to create more intricate effects.

Merry Muddy Xmas: Rick, 39, said: 'Two of the guys I work with keep their vans clean but I draw on the others'

Social media: Mr Minns posts pictures of his works of art on Facebook and Twitter and he has a loyal following

Each piece takes about 10 minutes and every few days he wipes the van down to create a fresh canvas for his creativity.

'It’s always a shame to wipe away a picture I’m proud of,” he added.

'Then again it’s nice to start afresh - it’s just frustrating waiting for the van to get dirty enough.

'Luckily I spend a lot of time on country roads, so it doesn’t take long.'

The father-of-three from a village in South Norfolk posts pictures of his works of art on Facebook and Twitter where he is gradually developing a loyal following.

'I first did it two years ago and somebody stopped and remarked on it,' he said.

'My first picture was a mountain scene, a lot like the ones I do now but not as sophisticated. We have six vans at work. Two of the guys keep theirs nice and clean but I draw on the others.

'The reaction I get is great - it’s just nice to see the smile on people’s faces when they notice.'

Mr Minns added he would like to find a way of raising money for charity through his hobby. He can be found on Twitter under the username @Ruddy-Muddy or as Ruddy Muddy on Facebook.

One graffiti artist came up with her own form of graffiti by using food and toiletries to create her artworks.

Photography graduate and artist, 
Dorota Pankowska, known as Dori the Giant, has tagged a series of brand 
logos using the product they represent.

Her
 project, called Pro Bono Promo, was taken to the streets of downtown 
Brampton, a Canadian city in Southern Ontario, where she painted product
 logos using the product they promote.

The
23-year-old created the Maxwell House logo by dry-rubbing its powdered 
coffee on to a wall; Sharpie's brand mark is replicated in magic marker;
Colgate is applied with a toothbrush on to red brick; and the Gillette 
logo lathered in shaving foam on the side of a salmon-coloured school 
building.
