She was in the House of Commons to insist that emergency 
legislation is needed to allow Britain’s spies to access data about the 
public’s phone calls, texts and emails.

But Theresa May, along with David Cameron, was seemingly unaware of her small fashion faux pas in Parliament today.

The optical illusion flesh-toned dress she wore may have left viewers confused - as it appeared that she was revealing more than she bargained on.

Trick of the light? Theresa May's dress was quite the optical illusion as she made a statement in the House of Commons after David Camerson announced fast-track legislation to ensure police and security services can access mobile and internet data

Luckily for the fashion-forward Home Secretary, it was just a trick of the light and, in fact, she looked very much on-trend as she made a speech on the new legislation.

Theresa May told MPs: 'Without this 
legislation, we face the prospect of losing access to this data 
overnight with the consequence police investigations will suddenly go 
dark and criminals will escape justice. We cannot allow that to happen.'

Theresa has become quite the style icon in Parliament and it has been noted that the politician shares many similar sartorial tastes
 with supermodel Cara Delevingne, who Ms May once described as 
'one of the most beautiful women in the world'.

On previous occasions she has been pictured wearing an 
eye-catching multicoloured coat paired with sassy knee-high leather 
boots just like a pair worn by Miss Delevingne.

At
 the Tory conference she turned heads in a £1,190 Vivienne Westwood 
tartan suit that was earlier showcased by the supermodel on her 21st 
birthday.

She is also well-known for her love 
of leopard print, a style coveted by Cara, and famously wore a pair of 
print kitten heels to the 2002 conference, as well as today in 
Parliament.

But the 57-year-old MP 
has laughed off similarities between herself and the 21-year-old 
supermodel.

Speaking as

 she collected the Spectator's Politician of the Year award last 
November, she said: 'This is the second good thing that's happened to 
me today because this morning, the Daily Mail asked: "Is Theresa May the
 new Cara Delevingne?"

'For
 those of you who don't know, she is 21, a supermodel and one of the 
most beautiful in the world - so I think we can safely say that the 
answer to that has to be filed by John Rentoul as a question, to which 
the answer is no.'
