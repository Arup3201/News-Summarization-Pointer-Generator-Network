England's Scott Fitzgerald made an early impression in the welterweight division at the Commonwealth Games after wobbling St Lucia's Ron Bastien inside the first five seconds of the opening round.

The Preston man rammed home a left hook which sent his opponent reeling backwards into the ropes, and fired the same shot early in the third to score a conclusive stoppage win.

Fitzgerald said: 'It is great to get in there and when I knocked him down early it gave me confidence. I looked for it a bit too much to begin with but in the end I got him.'

But there was disappointment for the first home nation boxer Lewis Benson, who dropped a split decision to Bowyn Morgan of New Zealand.

Benson was wobbled by a left hook midway through round two and despite a gutsy display he could not do enough to haul back the points deficit.

Northern 
Ireland's Michael Conlan, meanwhile, insists he will throw away his 
Commonwealth Games medal if it is any colour other than gold.

The
 Olympic bronze medallist shrugged off a head cut to claim a unanimous 
verdict over Mathew Martin of Nauru in his opening bantamweight bout.

Conlan's
 face was left streaked in blood after the third-round head clash but 
the small zigzag cut is not expected to compromise his future in the 
competition.

Conlan
 said: 'Gold at the Commonwealth Games would rank up there with the 
Olympics because it would mean winning a competition instead of 
finishing third.

'Gold
 is the only one I want - I don't want silver and I don't want bronze 
and I will throw them away if I do get them. On my day if I come in in 
the right frame of mind nobody is going to beat me. Everybody has their 
off days, but I'm not going to have an off day at these Commonwealth 
Games.'

Conlan
 was predictably too strong for the 19-year-old from the tiny Pacific 
atoll, and would have marked his opener down as a useful work-out but 
for his final round cut scare.

The
 Belfast man opened up in round two, clattering two right hands which 
forced standing counts and left the referee on the brink of stopping the
 contest.

Despite
 an increase in cuts since world governing body AIBA voted to abolish 
headguards for men in the wake of the London Olympics, Conlan maintains 
it was probably the right decision.

He
 added: 'I loved fighting with the headguard but cuts are going to be 
dangerous when you turn professional so you're better off learning now. 
Boxing is just going to have to get used to it.'
