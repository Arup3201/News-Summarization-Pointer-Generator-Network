It's called World's End - and right now it probably feels that way.

A tiny village in north Wales has been cut off from the world for more than a month after winter storms brought down phone lines.

Villagers living at World's End tucked away in a narrow steep-sided valley are lost without phone and internet links.

The lines were toppled by 100mph winds on February 12 and so far BT's engineers have failed to get them reconnected to the outside world.

The village of World's End in Denbighshire has been cut off from the world for a month after winter storms brought down phone lines

And they feel 'forgotten' at World's End as the lack of communication has damaged businesses in the remote Eglwyseg Valley in Denbighshire.

BT has apologised for the delay in repairs - blaming extensive damage to lines.

Winds brought down phone lines and power cables in the area during storms which battered much of Britain.

But while electricity was restored within five days, residents say they have no firm date for when their phone lines will be reconnected.

Portia Kennaway runs six businesses at World's End - including two farms and a caravan site.

She said 'very poor' mobile phone signals meant villagers have been left with little means of communication.

Ms Kennaway said: 'It's just depressing, nobody can get hold of us and they think we are avoiding them.

'People will just not believe that we haven't had phone lines for a month.

'Without a landline or internet connection I have had to rely on my staff to check business emails at their homes outside the valley.

'This has led to delays in getting back to people and left some customers unhappy.'

Ms Kennaway pays Â£3,600 a year in line rental to BT for phones for her home and businesses, said the firm should do more to help.

World's End is in North Wales, between Wrexham and Llangollen, and is popular with walkers

She said: 'We feel desperately forgotten and lonely. We are totally powerless and it's very depressing.

'We are trying to run businesses and we are being crippled.'

World's End is a narrow vale which lies at the head of the Eglwyseg Valley.

The area is very popular with walkers, cyclists and tourists and provides spectacular scenery throughout the year.

The isolated collection of farms and cottages lies on a single track road which crosses Esclusham Mountain, the Ruabon Moors and fords the Eglwyseg River.

A BT spokesman said they were 'sorry' for the delay in repairing the damaged phone lines.

The spokesman said: 'The bad weather last month did cause extensive local damage to some of our overhead lines and poles in the area.

'We're having to replace two poles and about 180m of line. Specialist equipment is needed for that.

'We expect to carry out the work next week, but before if possible.'
