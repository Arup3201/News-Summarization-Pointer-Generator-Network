Stress: Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell has spoken of the torment he underwent as the 'Plebgate' row raged on

Andrew Mitchell says he stopped eating, lost a stone in weight and struggled to get out of bed as the ‘Plebgate’ storm raged.

He would sit for hours, clutching his BlackBerry and fretting about the crisis in his career, according to his first account of the scandal.

In an article yesterday, the former chief whip described how the crisis took its toll on him and his family. Mr Mitchell, 56, and his wife Sharon, a GP, have two daughters, Rosie, 21, and Hannah, 25.

He said: ‘By day four, I could not sleep. I also stopped eating. Weight dropped off me. I lost more than a stone in the first three weeks.

'Sharon lost almost as much. Day after day the press assault continued.

‘On several days I simply could not get out of bed. I would sit for hours with my BlackBerry in one hand and my ancient mobile in the other.’

He went on: ‘Night-time was the worst. We would sleep for two hours and then wake, tossing and turning for the rest of the night as I contemplated the destruction of my career.

‘As I faced the wall at three in the morning, after a day of further creative attacks, aware of yet more awful nonsense pending the next, I wondered if I could really go on facing much more of this.’

The initial strategy was to ride out the storm.

The MP for Sutton Coldfield went to his Nottinghamshire home where his family were preparing for Rosie’s 21st birthday.

‘None of us had the faintest idea what was about to take place.’ He claims the media portrayed him as a ‘monster’ which ‘prompted almost 1,000 hostile emails over the first weekend alone’ and ‘took a huge toll’.

The MP, who also has a home in London, said reporters interviewed his neighbours, most of whom said ‘what a nice family we were’, but he added: ‘One, however, did not.

'Twenty-four years of apparently pent-up resentment burst into the public domain as this neighbour slagged us off.’

Mr Mitchell was brushing his teeth when the Prime Minister told him by phone to quit after learning of the ‘toxic’ email purporting to be from a member of the public and apparently corroborating the police version.

‘It was completely untrue,’ said Mr Mitchell. After a ‘tense six-minute conversation’, he persuaded Mr Cameron to give him another chance.

But he admits his attempt to draw a line under the affair by publicly apologising ‘was a disaster’ and he resigned on October 19.
