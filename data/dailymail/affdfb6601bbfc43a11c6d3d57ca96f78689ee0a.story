Sam Warburton was exhausted and delighted after leading Wales to a nail-biting RBS 6 Nations win over Ireland at the Millennium Stadium.

Ireland's Grand Slam hopes were dashed after they were beaten 23-16 in Cardiff on Saturday.

Warburton was sin-binned for the closing stages of the first half but was instrumental in Wales' heroic backs to the wall defence during wave after wave of Ireland attack.Â

The man of the match said he was physically and mentally drained after the enthralling win, which gives Wales a fighting chance of winning the championship if they beat Italy next weekend.

'That's probably one of the most exhausted I've felt after a Test match,' Warburton said on BBC One.

'It was an unbelievable effort. I could not have asked for more.

'Ireland, to their credit, kept coming and had lot of phases but our defence was so tough. All we had to do was keep our discipline. We did, and we won.'
