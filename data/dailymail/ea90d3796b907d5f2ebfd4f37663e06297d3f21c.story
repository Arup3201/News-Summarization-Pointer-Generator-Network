The woman who cheated on Kevin de Bruyne with his Belgium team-mate Thibaut Courtois has revealed that she had the affair after the Wolfsburg midfielder strayed with her former best friend. 

Rumours about a love-triangle between Caroline Lijnen and the duo first began in April 2013 but she has now spoken out, confirming that she was intimate with Courtois after De Bruyne admitted that he'd cheated on her.

Lijnen says she met the giant goalkeeper during a visit to Madrid, where he was playing for La Liga side Atletico Madrid on loan from Chelsea.

The 21-year-old alleges that Courtois wined and dined her in the Spanish capital and provided her with the engaging company that De Bruyne could not during their three-year relationship. 

Speaking to Belgian publication Story Magazine, she said: 'Kevin cheated on me. I did not say anything for months because I couldn't say anything, as Kevin's parents said they would take legal action if I gave my story. I was under pressure and I could not have contact with Kevin.

'I respected everything. But in his book Keep it Simple Kevin wrote a passage about my affair with Thibaut. So, I decided to remain silent no longer.

'In the summer of 2012, Kevin told me that he had an affair with my old best friend. I gave him the choice: her or me. I was ready to give him another chance, but our relationship was never the same afterwards.

'[I then went to Madrid, and even] Kevin thought that this trip was a good idea. I asked him beforehand. But then something happened that should never have happened.

'That evening, Thibaut offered me what I had not received during a three-year relationship with Kevin. With Thibaut, I could talk about anything and everything and he had even prepared me a delicious meal. Kevin never did it for me.

'Kevin had deceived me and I thought "Why shouldn't I do that too?"'

De Bruyne and Courtois, who are both expected to start against Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying on Tuesday night, were also owned by Chelsea at the same time but never played together.

The pair are believed to have patched up their differences since the incident, although the Wolfsburg midfielder was said to be 'devastated' upon hearing the news. A spokesperson from the Belgian FA even claimed the pair now laugh about it.

Speaking to Story Magazine in April last year, press officer Stefan van Loock said: 'We don't deny that there have been private problems between Thibaut Courtois and Kevin De Bruyne.

'But I've talked to both of them and they both confirm this case is closed for them. They have finished the quarrel. The guys talk again to each other and they even make jokes again.

'It's true the national manager has talked to both of them about the case. But it never has had any impact on the Belgian national team. It's a shame this case has gone public.'
