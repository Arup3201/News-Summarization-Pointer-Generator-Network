The bank that took control of the Newtown home where Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza lived burned everything inside to ensure nothing could be sold as as murder memorabilia.

All personal belongings and furniture were removed from the colonial-style home and incinerated, before Hudson Savings Bank of New Jersey handed ownership of the property to the Connecticut town.

Twenty-year-old Lanza shot his mother Nancy Lanza dead at the house before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook  in December 2012. He then killed himself at the school as police arrived.

Belongs to Newton: The Colonial-style home where Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza lived with his mother now belongs to the town

'There is nothing left but the light fixtures; we burned everything from the carpets to any personal effects left behind,' William LaCalamito, a senior vice president for Hudson Savings Bank of New Jersey told the Hartford Courant. 

'We didn't want anything from that house showing up for sale on eBay two years from now.'

California real estate expert Randall Bell, who has been involved in the sale or disposal of notorious properties including the Sharon Tate home and O.J. Simpson's house, was hired by the bank.

'It was a sad situation,' he told the newspaper. 'There was tons of stuff in that house. There were a lot of Adam Lanza's possessions still there and that stuff needed to be gone.'

The bank took over ownership of the home in September after Nancy Lanza's other son and sole heir, Ryan Lanza, sold it earlier this year.

The property, built in 1998, was assessed at more than $500,000 and had a fair market value of at least $360,000. 

But the home now belongs to the town after local officials agreed to buy it for $1.

'It certainly would have been a hard sell, but it probably could have been sold eventually,' Mr Bell said. 'But for this community, that was not the right thing to do.'

The bank is absorbing a mortgage of nearly $400,000 that Nancy Lanza had on the home, and is allowing Newtown to do what it wants with the property.

Mary Ann Jacob, head of the Newtown Legislative Council, says the council voted on Wednesday to accept ownership of the house.  

Jacob says any decision on how to use the property would come later and would involve the Board of Selectmen.

'Owning the house now gives the town control over what happens, and that was very important to us because of the tragedy,' Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra told Reuters. 'Those discussions will start in January.'

Some Newtown residents have said they would like to see the property torn down and replaced with a park or nature preserve. 

Ms Llodra said requests by families of the victims that the house be demolished would be taken into account and the town was 'strongly considering' tearing down the house.

Sandy Hook Elementary School has already been razed to the ground.

Speaking to the Hartford Courant, Mr LaCalamito added that the Hudson Bank went 'the extra mile' because of the situation, but is now done with the property.

'It's up to them to do whatever they choose,' he said. 'We wish the town nothing but the best.'
