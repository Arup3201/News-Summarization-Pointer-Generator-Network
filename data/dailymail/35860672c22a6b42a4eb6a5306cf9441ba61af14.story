At first, these images look like a 21st century ink-blot test, designed to test the viewer's unconscious mind with random patterns and shapes.

They were even created by an American psychologist Mark Scalco, 49, but these kaleidoscopic pictures are nothing to do with his work and are just for fun.

Mr Scalco, who refers to his work as 'smokreations', created the pictures using incense smoke, an ordinary camera and some Photoshop skills.

Mark Scalco layered an image of incense smoke before using a mirrored effect on editing software to create the snowflake-like pattern

Mr Scalco lets the random smoke shapes dictate the final picture. It wasn't until he turned this image upside down that he noticed the grasshopper, then used different colours to pick it out

Mr Scalco says his psychedelic images have been well-received online and at art shows he has participated in

'I've always enjoyed the patterns made by kaleidoscopes or some geometric screen-savers,' says Mr Scalco, of Durham, North Carolina.

'I remember as a kid looking for shapes in clouds and smoke. Sometimes they clearly resemble specific things like a face or animal, while some are less clear, people see different things in all of my work.

'It's a stress reliever for me since it is so completely different from my job.'

Working with a normal digital SLR camera and a black or white background, Mark uses incense smoke to produce his creations.

Mr Scalco says he makes the images as a stress-relief activity after a hard day at work

He took up photography by capturing images of buildings and nature, but switched to smoke photographs after reading about some of the effects that could be achieved in a book

Mr Scalco says that as a child he used to imagine shapes in clouds and smoke, and that adults see something different in his pictures

The images are then finalised using software, such as Photoshop, where he can use mirror effects and introduce striking colours to add the final touches to the mesmerizing patterns.

Mark explains: 'In the case of the green insect-like photograph, the smoke was duplicated and layered on itself and the whole thing was flipped upside down.

'Then the grasshopper creature was seen, I added the colour in Photoshop to make it fit with the insect-like creature I saw.

'The frosted smoke flake was more complicated, the smoke photo was layered multiple times, the photo was tinted in Photoshop, and the edges were added with a Photoshop plug-in for the final result.'

Mark's artistic experiments with smoke followed his existing interest in photography.

Mr Scalco says he was also mesmerised by patterns in kaleidoscopes and geometric screen-savers

Using editing tools allows Mr Scalco to create impossible patterns from the smoke, such as this disc which has a plume passing through its centre

He said: 'I started shooting waterfalls, nature, and architecture a number of years ago.

'I really became interested in smoke photography however from a book I read, and began playing with the artistic possibilities when you add certain effects to the images.

'Ultimately, the random shapes that occur in the smoke usually are what lead me toward a particular design.

This image, created from two identical plumes of smoke, looks a little like milk mixing into coffee

Mr Scalco usually takes his pictures against a black or white background, but has opted for a blue one here, making the purple pattern really stand out

'I have had very positive reactions from the photography websites that I am a member of, and art shows that I have participated in.

'I have also inspired others to try smoke photo art, which is of course really great.'
