Hospital visitors were able to watch surgeons operating on a naked patient after window blinds were left open, it was claimed today.

Bosses at Epsom Hospital in Surrey have apologised to the patient and launched a ‘thorough and urgent’ investigation after care assistant Claire Walsh, 38, alerted staff during a visit last Friday.

Miss Walsh said that she, three visitors and a patient all saw the surgery taking place in a room in the building opposite to where she was. She said some of the blinds on that room's window were open.

She contacted the hospital to report the 
incident and added that she informed a nurse on the ward, who allegedly 
said ‘that happens all the time’ and took no action to raise the alarm 
with staff.

Miss Walsh said: ‘I could see the whole thing. The blinds were open, not closed, so you could see straight through. Half of the window had blinds, but the other half didn’t have blinds at all.

‘There was a naked body on its side. The doctors were lifting up the leg and doing all kinds of bits to the body.  It looked like they were making incisions and there was someone standing over the body.’

Care assistant Miss Walsh said the main lights of the operating room were on and there was another light close to the patient - who was believed to have been undergoing a hip operation.

She added: ‘It was still light outside. The blinds should have been shut. That poor person’s respect and dignity had gone out of the window. Where did their rights come into it?

‘The visitors were all disgusted and so was the patient who saw. I feel sorry for that person, it’s just awful. If I had a kid with me that would have been traumatic and horrific.’

Miss Walsh, of Tattenham Corner, Surrey, was referred to the hospital's Patient Advice and Liaison Service following her complaint.

The hospital offered the patient the opportunity to speak to its Patient Advice and Liaison service – but the patient did not wish to take it any further.

The hospital has apologised to the patient and said the blinds had not been closed properly after the window was cleaned. It has also launched a ‘thorough and urgent’ investigation into the incident.

Miss Walsh said she was ‘still in shock’ after witnessing the operation, which she said was continuing as she left after her half-hour visit.

An Epsom Hospital spokesman said: ‘As a trust we take the privacy, dignity and confidentiality of our patients very seriously.

‘On Friday, January 10, we believe that a secure blind in a window to one of our operating theatres, which is usually closed and locked between two panes of double glazing, was not closed properly after the window was cleaned.

‘As such, part of one of our operating theatres may have been visible to a small number of other patients and we deeply regret that.

‘We have contacted the patient affected to discuss this incident and have offered our full and sincere apologies. However, as with any patient undergoing an operation, this patient would have been protected by a gown and sterilised drapes throughout the procedure.’

The spokesman added that having spoken to the staff and surgeon who conducted the operation in question, the hospital does not believe that the patient would have been naked at any point.

She said: ‘During the operation the 
patient is covered in sterile theatre drapes so only a small part of the
 side of the body would have been exposed.’

'The visitors were all disgusted and so was the patient who saw. I feel sorry for that person, it’s just awful. If I had a kid with me that would have been traumatic and horrific'

Claire Walsh, care assistant

Asked about the nurse’s comments to Miss Walsh which suggested that this was not a one-off incident, the spokesman said: ‘The issue has never been raised with us before.

‘We are currently looking into the allegation that this lady’s claims were initially dismissed.’

The hospital’s joint medical director Dr Ruth Charlton said: ‘We would like to assure our patients and visitors that we are taking this matter very seriously, and the thorough investigation we have launched is still underway.

‘As such, we cannot offer any further information until all of the facts are fully established. This is the first time such an incident has ever been reported to us, and we are urgently investigating the allegations.

‘Although it is rare, in any situation where we feel that a patients’ privacy may have been compromised we will not hesitate to act, and will take immediate steps to help ensure that a similar event could not happen again.

‘I have personally asked all five of our directorates (medicine, women and children’s, regional services, clinical services and surgery, critical care and anaesthetics) to review every clinical area they are responsible for, in order to ensure that the privacy and dignity of every patient we treat is protected at all times.’

The £2.5million Day Case Unit - where the operation was believed to have taken place - at the hospital was opened in October 2012 by the Duchess of Gloucester.

At the time, Matthew Hopkins, the hospital’s chief executive, said it was designed ‘around the needs of our patients with an emphasis on ensuring patients receive the utmost privacy and dignity’.
