Gary Goldsmith and his fourth wife Julie-Ann Brown having lunch near their £1.7million Marlybone house

Like many a would-be author before him, Gary Goldsmith is discovering a multitude of distractions to avoid the taxing business of putting pen to paper.

One day this week, for example, Kate Middleton’s black-sheep uncle was to be found enjoying a long and leisurely lunch with friends at the £100-a-head panoramic restaurant at the top of The Gherkin building in London.

Other times, he can be spied tucking into his favourite duck egg and chicken livers starter  at the ultra-smart Dean Street Townhouse  in Soho.

Whatever the venue, the high-living Goldsmith, who revels in the nickname Gary Goldtaps, likes nothing better than to indulge his taste for fine wine, a favourite being a smooth 1999-vintage Chateau de Sales Pomerol — a snip at £90.

In truth, it is hard to imagine that multi-millionaire Goldsmith, the younger brother of Kate’s mother, Carole, is stuck for things to write as he begins the task of penning his juicy memoirs.

After all, he could start with his infamous encounter with the News Of The World’s ‘Fake Sheikh’ at 47-year-old Gary’s colourfully named Ibiza home, Maison de Bang Bang, during which Goldsmith was caught on camera snorting cocaine and offering to get the paper’s undercover reporter drugs and Brazilian prostitutes. 

Or perhaps he could commit to the page his romantic fourth wedding seven months ago to his auburn-haired girlfriend Julie-Ann Brown.

The prospect of reading his account of either event is likely, it has to be said, to have sent a chill down the spine of the social-climbing Mrs Middleton as she reclined with her daughter and son-in-law, Prince William, on the Caribbean island of Mustique this week.

Neither Carole nor the royal couple were 
present when tattooed Gary — who like his sister was raised in a 
Middlesex council house — tied the knot in London with 43-year-old Miss 
Brown last July.

And the new Mrs Goldsmith undoubtedly represents a rather colourful addition to the Middleton clan. She is a convicted fraudster who siphoned off £250,000 from a luxury car firm, where she worked as a clerk, and blew the loot on Rolex watches and Mercedes sports cars.

Mr Goldsmith rather sheepishly admitted to me this week: ‘The wedding was a very quiet affair. Carole and Kate were not there. There were just four very close, dear friends. But we are going to celebrate it properly next year with a big bash.’

What’s the betting, though, that Carole and the royal couple — who holidayed with entrepreneur Goldsmith at his Balearic pleasure palace in 2006, but publicly cut ties with him after the embarrassing drug revelations — find they have other plans that day?

Certainly, the re-emergence of Carole’s troublesome sibling onto the public radar, with his plans for a tell-all book, is something the ambitious Mrs Middleton, 58, could well do without.

After all, she and Kate’s father, Michael, who run a lucrative party merchandise firm, have recently moved even further up in the world by splashing out £4.7 million to become lord and lady of a grand manor house in the rolling West Berkshire countryside.

And what Carole makes of her new sister-in-law is anyone’s guess. Born in Stockport, Cheshire, Miss Brown — who was also brought up in a council house — bears the blinged-up, perma-tanned look of someone who, after a troubled past, has finally landed on her feet.

Over the past two years, Julie-Ann — who favours Chanel handbags, plunging tops, and sports suspiciously inflated breasts and lips — has been a regular fixture at Maison de Bang Bang, which Goldsmith has just put on the market for 6.5 million Euros (£5.6 million).

She developed a rather unlikely taste for the finer things in life in the mid-Nineties while earning £11,000 a year in the accounts department of the Stratstone car dealership in Wilmslow, Cheshire.

Unbeknown to her bosses, she siphoned off cash that she spent on jewellery, including a £12,500 Rolex watch, a £41,000 Mercedes sports car, plus holidays in Barbados and trips to The Ritz in Paris.

When her ruse was finally rumbled, she admitted five charges of theft and asked for 52 similar offences to be taken into consideration at her trial at Chester Crown Court in 1996.

But she escaped jail and was given a suspended sentence after the judge was told she had endured a troubled and deprived childhood.

Clearly, however, her liking for the trappings of money and privilege stuck, and subsequently she has dated a string of rich and successful men, including a self-made communications millionaire called Ray Ingleby, with whom she lived in a property beside London’s Regent’s Park before he was declared bankrupt in August 2010.

Mr Goldsmith now says that he would have a 'nosebleed' if he left a W1 postcode

She then moved on to Goldsmith, who made a fortune in 2005 by selling his recruitment firm, Computer Futures, for £275 million. As well as the Ibiza retreat, they also share his £1.7 million mews house in Marylebone.

Ominously for Mrs Middleton — and royal courtiers who consider her brother a loose cannon — Goldsmith once more finds himself unemployed and with time to kill after abruptly parting company with IT recruitment company InterQuest last month following less than a year in their employ.

Since then, it seems he has returned to the freewheeling, hedonistic lifestyle that got him into so much trouble in 2009 when he fell victim to the now-defunct tabloid’s sting.

With that in mind, perhaps, in recent weeks he has been touting himself around firms in the same field in the hope of getting another position.

But he denies he’s looking for a job, or that deciding to sell up in Spain has anything to do with strained finances, and insisted to me this week that he is in the market for as big a property in London’s West End.

Mr Goldsmith told me: ‘I’m selling Ibiza just because I’m smart with my money. It’s a really good time to be selling something in Euros and buying something in pounds.

‘It’s just me changing my focus and my profile and I’m definitely buying something bigger in London. If I move out of the W1 postcode I get a nosebleed!

‘I parted company with InterQuest on the best possible terms, so we’re all very cool. I’ve had non-executive job offers left, right and centre since then, but I’m catching up with friends at the moment.

‘I’ve not needed to work for a very long time. In fact, for a while, I watched so much Judge Judy [a U.S. courtroom reality show] on daytime TV, I thought I could pass the bar exam. That’s why I wanted to do something with InterQuest and I’m sure I’ll do something again soon.

The royals won't be happy to hear about Mr Goldsmith's plan to sell his memoirs

‘I have a got a few personal projects, but at the moment I’m just chilling out and just having some fun for a bit.’

One of those projects is the writing of his book, for which he has not yet sought a publisher, but which, he assured me this week, will ‘tell the world the whole story’ of his colourful life thus far.

However, Goldsmith’s planned revelations, plus, you would think, his choice of wife, threaten to see him banished once more into the cold after the royal couple tentatively invited him back into their fold.

Despite his News Of The World humiliation, he was on the guest-list at William and Kate’s wedding in April 2011, to which he turned up in a £280,000 bright blue Rolls-Royce Phantom convertible.

But, notably, rather than taking his then new lover, Miss Brown, he arrived with second wife Luan and their daughter, Tallulah, now 11, who is one of Kate’s favourite cousins.

He was divorced from wife number three, blonde accountant Julia Leake, 35, just days before the revelations of his drug-taking at Maison de Bang Bang, whose wall bears a 6ft-high mural proclaiming: ‘It’s Gary’s world, you just live in it.’

At the time, Goldsmith was living on the Mediterranean island with a former lapdancer called Antonia.

Despite, or possibly because of, the house’s notoriety, it has become popular with Premier League footballers, and Liverpool and England star Jordan Henderson rented it last summer.

According to Goldsmith, his recent fourth wedding will be his last: ‘We’re very much in love and this one’s a keeper,’ he told me this week.

‘We have just celebrated six months and it’s all been very cool. It was just the right thing to do. I won’t be having any more kids, though, I’m very happy with my daughter Tallulah, she’s epic.’

No doubt, his big sister Carole might have been hoping that with the imminent sale of his infamous Spanish playground, her problems with bothersome Gary might  be over.

But with that tell-all book and colourful new bride, she might just have to think again. Whether Uncle Gary and his fraudster wife will be smiling proudly in the Royal Christening pictures when a new heir to the throne arrives in the summer remains to be seen.
