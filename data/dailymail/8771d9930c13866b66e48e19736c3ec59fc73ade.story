A controlling boyfriend murdered his  girlfriend by stamping on her head after she refused to give him her Facebook password, a court has heard.

Kane Boyce is accused of murdering  Paula Newman in 'a violent rage' at the home they shared in Croydon, south London, after allegedly becoming convinced the 20-year-old was cheating on him.

The 34-year-old denies murder, claiming the woman died after falling out of his BMW during a late-night drive. 

Today the Old Bailey heard how Miss Newman was heard by neighbours 'shrieking' as the defendant shouted at her to hand over her social media passwords on November 13, 2013.

They are then thought to have driven in Boyce's car, later returning to the property where neighbours noticed Miss Newman, who had mild learning difficulties, was 'visibly unwell'.

Paramedics were called to the property the following day but were unable to revive Miss Newman, who weighed under 9-stone. 

A post-mortem examination revealed she died as the result of head injuries.

Prosecutor Gillian Etherton told the court how Boyce had become 'obsessed' with the victim's social media accounts in the weeks before her death. 

'This defendant is a man who is jealous, obsessive, controlling, and violent’, said prosecutor Gillian Etherton QC.

‘The defendant, in a violent rage, beat and it would appear kicked or stamped on Paula’s head causing her severe and irreparable brain injury which brought about her death.’

On the night before her death Boyce was allegedly heard revving the engine of his car and threatening: 'If you don't log on (to Facebook), we'll see what happens.' 

He is alleged to have told a friend: ‘I've asked her for this Facebook account and she won’t give it over to me for love nor money,' and also wrote social media posts accusing the woman of cheating. 

As Miss Newman was being treated by paramedics, he accessed her account and voicemail from a mobile phone, it was claimed.

‘In the weeks prior to Paula’s death, and indeed at the time of her death, this defendant became obsessed with getting access to Paula’s Facebook accounts’, said Ms Etherton.

'Evidence shows that her phone was used to access or attempt to access a number of sites between 4.59am and 6.20am, a time when we know she would have been incapacitated due to the severity of her injuries.

‘We know that this defendant left Dunsfold Way while the paramedics were there attempting to save Paula’s life.

‘We know Paula Newman’s phone being used to check her voicemail at 6.54am and 7am.'

In the weeks before her death Miss Newman is said to told a friend she was planning to leave Boyce whom she met when the pair moved in to the same home. 

'It appears that at the beginning of their relationship, the defendant treated Paula well and gave her gifts, but within a few months this changed’, Ms Etherton added.

‘The relationship was up and down to say the very least.

‘By the end of the summer, Paula was confiding in those close to her that they were serious problems in the relationship, they were arguing, she told those close to her that the defendant was controlling, abusive and possessive and she was unhappy.’

Stefani Taylor, a friend of Ms Newman, told police: ‘He had complete control of her and I have never seen her like that before.

‘I pleaded with her to leave him but she would always say she loved him.' 

Just four days before her death, the victim asked a friend to help her move out of the property she was sharing with Boyce in New Addington. 

The pair had only been together for seven months after meeting in Beckenham, south London. 

Three days after his girlfriend's death, Boyce allegedly bought a new phone after being released on police bail to change his relationship status on Facebook to 'single'. 

He also logged onto her Zoosk dating profile, it was claimed. 

The 34-year-old has a history of violence towards women, it was alleged, and was described as 'manipulative'.

‘This defendant has the ability to charm women’, said Ms Etherton.

‘However, when we dig deeper into his history the evidence shows that over the years when it suits him he can and often has behaved towards his partners in a sadistic and cruel way.

‘He is capable of being manipulative, very controlling, and extremely violent to previous partners.

‘Previous attacks on different partners include repeated serious violence, such as punching and kicking to the head and body.’

‘Kane Boyce was alone the aggressor that night, driven by jealousy and anger about Paula’s Facebook activity and in the build up to her death, and on the day of her death he was aggressive and threatening about this activity.

‘In the early hours of November 12, Paula received not a single push causing her to fall but a sustained beating at the hands and very likely foot of this defendant, causing her severe head injuries and resulting in her untimely death.’

When questioned by police Boyce told investigators Miss Newman died after jumping out of his moving car. 

He pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies murder. 

The trial at the Old Bailey continues.
