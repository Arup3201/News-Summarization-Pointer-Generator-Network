Two Philadelphia police officers have a friend for life in the form of a dog who was missing three days before being found stuck neck-deep in mud.

Sergeant Mike Martin and Officer Mike Kushner received a call from a distressed dog owner whose beloved pup, 13-year-old Pluto, had been missing three days.

The dog was found with just his head sticking out of mud close to a stream in Willistown Township.

Martin and Kushner didn't hesitate to jump into the mud and pull the weak canine to safety.

Pluto was away from home and without food or water for three days as he struggled to free himself from the mud.

The dog was close to death and too exhausted to even muster a wag of his tail as the officers loaded him onto a makeshift gurney.

Pluto's owner took him to Sugartown Veterinary Hospital where he was treated.

The pooch is now back home with his family and doing well.

Pluto's owner said, 'We feel very fortunate indeed that you are there and always quick to respond, skilled and compassionate.'

Had he remained much longer in the dangerous mud, Pluto would surely have died.

Photographs and video from the rescue show that Pluto's nose was barely clearing the surface of the mud when the officers rescued him.

The mud was likely caused by torrential rains and severe flooding that affected Pennsylvania about two weeks ago.
