Leyton Orient will insist on Russell Slade quitting the club if he wants to take the reins at Cardiff.

The Championship club, who sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last week, are keen on Slade replacing the former Manchester United manager.

Orient have already blocked two approaches from Cardiff, and will insist that the manager resigns from his current role if he wants to join Cardiff.

The east London club's stance leaves Slade in a somewhat awkward position knowing he is not guaranteed the Cardiff job.

Slade celebrates 20 years in management this month, and has been in charge of seven clubs during his career. 

He joined Leyton Orient in April 2010 with the club facing relegation to League Two, but managed to bring them to 17th and safety in League One.

From there Slade has built on his first-season success, culminating in a third-place finish last season.

Orient missed out in the play-off final, losing to Rotherham in a penalty shoot-out, and will look to try again this season - but whether that will be with Slade at the helm remains to be seen.
