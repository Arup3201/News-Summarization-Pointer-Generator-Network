Drive-through bottle shops in the Northern Territory have introduced a bizarre policy to refuse cask wine sales if a customer doesn't have a car in a bid to try and control binge drinking.

Beer Wine and Spirits (BWS) is trialling the new policy in three stores in Parap, Palmerston and Darwin Airport, the ABC reports.

The bottle shop company has put up signs at the three stores saying the ban on cask wine was carried out to 'assist the community in minimising the alcohol-related harm'.

The 'No Car No policy on cask wine' was implemented from Monday, January 19. 

While BWS is attempting to crackdown on alcohol-related issues, the People's Alcohol Action Coalition said the policy would just encourage people to get taxis to buy cask wine.

'All it leads to is people getting in taxis and coming through to get their grog and getting out of taxis at the other end,' Doctor John Boffa told the ABC,

'In fact, when this was done in Alice Springs we had the absurd situation where taxis lined up, people would get in, get their grog, and get out on the other side.'

High rates of deaths among the Indigenous community in the Northern Territory has been attributed to high alcohol consumption and 60 percent of assaults in Darwin involve drinking. 

Currently there are more than 100 'restricted areas' across the Northern Territory where it is illegal to possess or consume alcohol unless a liquor permit has been issued. 

These restricted areas implemented by the government range from a total ban on alcohol to liquor only available from a licensed premises.
