Pebble's new Time smartwatch has become the most funded project ever on crowd-funding site Kickstarter, raising more than £9.7 million ($14.9 million) in one week. 

The smartwatch, which is Pebble's third product but the first to feature a colour screen, had already broken one record by raising over (£5.8 million) ($9 million) in its first day on the site.

So far, more than 60,000 people have backed the Pebble Time project, which is set to be launched in May this year. 

California company Pebble has broken the all-time Kickstarter record. They raised more than £9.7 million in just a week - with 23 days still to go. So far more than 60,000 people have backed the new smartwatch (shown). But Pebble has been criticised for still using Kickstarter to raise funds

Pebble Time beat the previous overall funding record of £8.7 million ($13.3 million) set by the Coolest Cooler, a drinks cooler that comes with a built-in blender, wireless speaker and USB charging points - and there are still 23 days of funding to go in Pebble's Kickstarter.

Pebble's original smartwatch is third on the all-time list, having raised more than £6.5 million ($10 million) after having an initial funding goal of £65,000 ($100,000).

The new Time smartwatch comes with a colour e-paper screen similar to the technology used on e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle, with Pebble promising up to seven days battery life as a result. The watch is also water resistant.

The Time will have a retail price of £129 ($199) once the Kickstarter campaign ends on March 28, but those who choose to fund the Time have been able to pre-order the wearable device for less.

10. Project Eternity game - £2.5 million ($3.9 million)

There are still units available for £116 ($179) on Pebble's Kickstarter page.

A movie of TV show Veronica Mars and Scrubs actor Zach Braff's most recent movie Wish I Was Here have both been funded on the site previously, as has a music player by Neil Young.

Some experts, however, have criticised the use of Kickstarter by established companies like Pebble - and say it should be the reserve of startups only.

More than a million units of the original Pebble Watch have been sold since it was funded in 2012, making it one of the most successful wearables on the market.

‘I'm not saying that successful people can't use Kickstarter but, to me, their cap-in-hand use of the platform has always felt fraudulent,’ said Daniel Cooper for Engadget.

‘It'd be like watching Bill Gates, Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett panhandling on the streets of Seattle.’

He added: ‘It's a romantic notion, but I always saw Kickstarter as a way to empower inventors (and creatives) who couldn't get backing any other way.’ 

At the Mobile World Congress technology show in Barcelona this week, Pebble announced they would also be selling a high-end Steel version of the Time that would cost around £160 ($245), and look similar to the premium version of the Apple Watch.

Some experts have suggested this week that the premium Apple Watch Edition could cost as much as £425 ($650), meaning Pebble may be able to draw attention and possibly some sales away from the technology giant by undercutting them in price.

Apple is set to announce the final details of its own wearable at a press event in San Francisco next week, including a launch date and full price options of the three versions of the device.

Last month, Apple chief Tim Cook confirmed the wearable would go on sale in April.
