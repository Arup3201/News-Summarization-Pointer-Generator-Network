A teenager accused of raping a girl at a sleepover claims he was sleepwalking during the alleged attack.

The defendant, who can't be named for legal reasons, denies the offence, claiming he was suffering from a condition which has been termed 'sexsomnia'.

A court heard that before the alleged rape the teenagers had been watching the 2008 film Taken.

The 16-year-old girl alleges she woke up on a friend's sofa to find the 18-year-old on top of her.

The defendant denies raping the 16-year-old girl, claiming he was suffering from 'sexsomnia', Leicester Crown Court (pictured) has heard

In a filmed police statement, played at Leicester Crown Court yesterday, she said: 'I remember just waking up and realising what he was doing. He was raping me.

'It was without my consent or knowledge beforehand because I was asleep and he woke me up. It was the middle of the night.

'I pushed his shoulders and chest. I was confused and afraid and managed to scramble away from him.

'I fell off the end of the sofa. He moved away and said, "I haven't done anything".

'He kept trying to grab me, saying I'd imagined it.'

The alleged victim said she had slept fully dressed on the sofa of the house in Loughborough, while the teenager had slept on the floor.

She claimed the defendant later told a friend sleeping upstairs he had not done anything and suggested swapping rooms - and that if he left the room she would later wake up and think it was 'all a dream'.

She claimed the defendant, also from Loughborough, had undone her belt buckle and pulled down her briefs, leggings and shorts to carry out the alleged attack while she slept on April 26, 2011.

The girl claimed the accused was earlier 'staring' at her, making her feel uncomfortable, as she and others watched the film.

She said she had been reluctant to share the lounge with the defendant overnight, but did not make 'a big deal' of it.

'I didn't think he'd do something like this,' she said.

The girl claimed she fell asleep while watching television, after others had gone to bed. She said she last remembers the defendant, also a house guest, arranging his sleeping bag on the floor.

Felicity Gerry, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant denies rape on the basis he was asleep and doesn't accept he penetrated her.

'The Crown says you can be sure he was not asleep, but she was. He raped her and got caught. He claims he was sleepwalking.'

She said it was linked to a recognised condition known as 'sexsomnia.'

Miss Gerry said: 'It wasn't a particularly rowdy evening, although there was some evidence cannabis had been smoked.'

The trial continues.Â
