Authorities say a pair of deer on the Golden Gate bridge snarled traffic in and out of San Francisco during the evening commute.

The California Highway Patrol tells the San Francisco Chronicle that the deer were in the busier northbound lanes leading out of the city toward Marin County on Friday evening at about 5:30 p.m.

The deer briefly halted the evening commute as drivers slowed to give them space.

Move over!: The deer were eager to get off the bridge from San Francisco and to reach Marin and get away from the cars

By 6 p.m., the officers on the way to the scene were called off because the deer were no longer in the road.

The deer spotting caused quite a stir on social media as witnesses flocked to Instagram to post photos an video from the unusual event.

'Not a big deal. Just some deer running down the middle of the road on the Golden Gate Bridge,' joked Luca Jackson on Instagram.

CHP Officer William Ogilvie tells the Chronicle that it's not uncommon for calls about 'animal hazards' to work themselves out before the officers arrive because animals don't like traffic any more than humans do.

NBC reports that the deer seemed entered the bridge from the south, according to CHP Officer Andrew Barclay.

The deer forced three northbound traffic lanes to a halt as they scampered all the way from San Francisco toward Marin.

'They pretty much created their own traffic break,' Barclay said.

'That could be what saved the deer from getting hurt ... If it was lighter traffic the cars would have been moving faster,'he added.

This isn't the first time that animals have been spotted on the Golden Gate Bridge but this is the first time it's happened during his two years as serving as a public information officer.

Despite the commotion, the deer got off the bridge safe and sound and the drivers were able to put their hooves on the gas pedal once again though they were still stuck in traffic.
