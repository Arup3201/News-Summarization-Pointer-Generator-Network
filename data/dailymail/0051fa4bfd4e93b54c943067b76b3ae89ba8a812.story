At Christmas the saying goes 'be grateful for what you get.'

But this child certainly wasn't impressed with the gift he received. 

Dean Fisher filmed the moment his six-year-old relative unwrapped a jersey for his ice hockey team's rival club.

The youngster is seen excitedly opening the present until he spots that it is a yellow and black Pittsburgh Penguins long-sleeved top instead of an orange and black one for the Philadelphia Flyers.

His family are heard laughing as they watch his outraged reaction.

The little boy then gets up from the table and moves over to his father for a reassuring hug.

'That's my boy' the man says as a look of disdain continues to spread across his son's face. 

'We'll use that for toilet paper,' he adds chuckling.

Source of amusement: Fisher, who filmed the incident, said that the jersey was gifted as a joke

Passing it on: His sister ordered the Sidney Crosby jersey for her son as a Christmas gift - Crosby is the captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins - but unfortunately it was too small

His sister ordered the Sidney Crosby jersey for her son as a Christmas gift - Crosby is the captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Unfortunately, the item of clothing was too small, and it was too late to send it back.

So instead the family decided to 'have some fun' with the resident Flyers fan and capture his appalled reaction.
