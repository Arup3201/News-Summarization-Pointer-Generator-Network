Former speed merchant Eddie Irvine has made a quick property deal to pocket a profit that’s understood to have been more than $5m.

The 47-year-old ex-Formula One driver bought a five-bedroom beachside home in Miami Beach, Florida, last year for $1.95m, according to property records.

Now he has already sold the home, located at 410 West San Marino Drive and designed by architect Luis Bosch, to an unidentified local developer.

Irvine, who drove for Ferrari for five years and Jaguar for three, has made millions in property investment since his retirement from driving.

But the Down man, who’s said to be worth around €90m and who continued his business after ending his F1 career, is thought to have made most of his current fortune since he quit racing in 2002.

In 2006, he was listed as the fifth richest person in Northern Ireland. He also made the Sunday Times Rich List last year.

Much of his money has been made from ‘flipping’ properties – buying a property and selling it shortly after for a huge profit. Mr Irvine also runs Eddie Irvine Sports in Bangor, Co. Down, which includes an indoor karting track and fieldturf pitches.

But despite buying an island in the Bahama’s Exuma Cays for over $1m, where his neighbours include Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage and Eddie Murphy, business success hasn’t always come easy for Fast Eddie.

Mr Irvine opened the hugely popular Cocoon Bar in Dublin in 2005, which became a favourite spot for Ireland’s Celtic Tiger cubs.

But in 2009 Cocoon closed its doors after it ran up huge losses and a legal dispute between Mr Irvine and his former business partner John Foley ended up in the High Court.

Mr Irvine has been linked to a string of beauties including DJ Michelle Doherty and Baywatch beauty Pamela Anderson. In 1997, he was asked how he was getting on with his then-Brazilian model girlfriend who had little English.

Mr Irvine famously replied: ‘I get on fine with her, she’s a bit thick and she’s not great looking, but f*** me, she’s dynamic in bed.'
