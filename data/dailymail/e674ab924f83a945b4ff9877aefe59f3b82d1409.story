Double the trouble: Pennsylvania substitute English teacher Tiffany Leiseth is accused of having sex with two 18-year-old male students just days before graduation

A 26-year-old Pennsylvania substitute English teacher stands accused of sleeping with two of her 18-year-old high school students.

New Brighton High School teacher Tiffany Leiseth allegedly slept with the male students on back to back days last May, just hours after final classes but days before graduation.

While both students were consenting adults at the time, Leiseth was charged because they had not yet officially graduated and maintained a student-teacher relationship with her. 

Investigators say Leiseith invited the two students over to home separately, on May 27 and 28, while her husband was away on business. She then offered both minors beer before engaging in intercourse.

School district officials started investigating Leiseth on May 30, after another teacher overheard some students talking about obscene photos another male student had received.

Also, an unidentified person called police and reported that a female teacher was sending lewd pictures to male students.

Police were able to track down the student who had the pictures on his phone, and found that they were sent by Leiseth. But the student in question denied having any sort of sexual relationship with her

Schools Superintendent Joseph Guarino placed Leisith on unpaid leave on June 1, and she was terminated two days later when more pictures surfaced on a different student's phone. That student also claimed he had no sexual contact with Leiseth.

Scene: The alleged incidents took place on May 27 and May 28, while Leiseth's husband was out of town on business. Investigators said she invited the male students over on different days, offered them beer and then engaged in intercourse

But a fellow teacher reported to police that Leiseth confessed to having sex with both male students. 

Leiseth was arraigned in court on Monday with two felony counts of having sexual contact with a student and one count of providing alcohol to a minor.

Her defense attorney Mike Deriso has issued a statement, saying they will fight the charges.

'She was not their teacher at the time, and they were not her students. My client did not pursue those boys. They are adults. They make their own decisions,' Mr Deriso told KDKA.

Superintendent Guarino has since issued a statement saying the school district 'promptly' reported the teacher's actions to police. 

Fired: Leiseth started as a substitute teacher for the town middle school in 2012-2013, and moved on to the high school the following school year. She has since been terminated

'The district has provided our complete cooperation with all involved agencies in the matters that were reported and we will continue to do so through the completion of the case. Although we would like to provide further comment, we are unable to do so in light of pending litigation.

'The individual is no longer employed by the district and we are unable to make further comment as this is a personnel matter and the law prohibits us from making comments on matters of personnel.'

Leisith began working for the district at a middle school substitute teacher in the 2012-2013 year before being hired as a permanent substitute english teacher for the high school in 2013-2014.
