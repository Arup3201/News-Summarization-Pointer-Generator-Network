Louis van Gaal has spoken of his admiration for Arturo Vidal, and admitted the Chile and Juventus midfielder is a player he 'always wanted to buy'.

The 27-year-old is on the wishlist of a number of clubs, including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea, and it seems Manchester United are ready to join the race.

Van Gaal, heading to the World Cup with the Netherlands, tried to sign Vidal while at Bayer Leverkusen but he opted for Juventus instead.

Second chance: Vidal is a player Louis van Gaal 'always wanted to buy' while at Bayer Leverkusen

'Chile have very dangerous players,' he said, as reported by ESPN.

'I always wanted to buy Vidal when he was at Bayer Leverkusen but he went to Juventus.

'I like a lot of Chile players and they always play an attacking style.

'It will be difficult for the Netherlands but we have confidence in the three games we have to play.'

Van Gaal will get his chance to see Vidal in the flesh when the Netherlands take on Chile at the World Cup. The two teams sit in Group B alongside Spain and Australia.

Man United's lack of Champions League football could prove troubling, though, as Vidal may be swayed by the European pull of other clubs.

The Netherlands' World Cup bid gets underway on June 13 when they take on holders Spain in Salvador, but van Gaal looks to have captain and striker Robin van Persie back.

'Van Persie has a groin injury but he can deal with it, so it looks okay,' he said.

'I think he's good. He trained with us but it was a light training session. We have to see tomorrow.'

Swansea City midfielder Jonathan de Guzman is also on his way back from a hamstring injury.
