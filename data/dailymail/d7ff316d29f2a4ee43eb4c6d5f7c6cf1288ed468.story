Robin Roberts has returned to Good Morning America exactly five months after she underwent a bone marrow transplant in her battle against a rare blood disorder.

The beloved host was given a raucous welcome by her fellow hosts - and there were even congratulatory messages from the Obamas, Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton and actor Bradley Cooper.

Roberts, who took a break from the show as she fought myelodysplastic syndrome, looked relaxed, healthy and proudly displayed her closely-cropped hair as she returned to the co-host's chair.

'Hi, it's Robin, and I've been waiting 174 days to say this: Good morning, America!' she said. 'I am so full of gratitude. I share this morning, this day of celebration, with everyone.'

Happy to be back: After a five-month hiatus Ms Roberts made a triumphant return to GMA on February 20, 2013, excitedly telling viewers: 'Hi, it's Robin, and I've been waiting 174 days to say this: Good morning, America!'

Welcome message: Michelle and President Obama passed on their best wishes to Roberts in a video

'I keep pinching myself and I realise this is real,' she said. 'This is actually happening, and I don't have my froggy slippers on, or do I?'

Her return, which had been promoted 
two weeks ago by ABC, was celebrated by the show's fans as thousands 
sent well-wishes to Roberts on social networking sites and 
brandished signs across the country and outside the studio in Time Square.

The Obamas also shared in the celebration, welcoming Roberts back with a video message

'We just want you to know that the 
whole Obama family - we've been thinking about you and praying for you 
and rooting for you every step of the way,' the first lady said.

Her husband added: 'You've been an inspiration to all of us and we couldn't be happier doing what you do best... Robin, it's great to see you back in that chair and we're all excited to start our morning with you once again.'

Roberts, 52, struggled to contain her emotions as she thanked everyone for their support, including viewers, her family, her colleagues, medical staff and the executives of the show.

'Our viewers, they have been so incredibly wonderful and I appreciate that,' she said. 'When I was at home watching with my froggy slippers, and I saw those people out there, it was just wonderful.'

Her fight to regain her health with the help of yoga and doctors had been documented by the show over the past five months. On today's program, she was joined by her doctors and nurses and led a standing ovation for them.

Her oncologist Dr Gail J. Roboz said
Roberts looked ready to return to the show after they held a test-run in 
January - but added that she did not expect the Oscars and an interview 
with Michelle Obama to be Roberts' first assignments.

The GMA studios underwent a thorough 
clean and colleagues and crew were given flu shots so Roberts could 
return to a healthy environment, reducing her chances of falling ill 
again.

She will undergo bone marrow tests in two weeks to see if she remains in the clear.

'You are back this morning and look at that smile,' co-host George Stephanopoulos said.

said from Tehran, as the ESPN pundits added: 'We are happy to have you back. Keep on smiling and keep on doing what you're doing.'

ABC announced that Roberts will interview Mrs Obama later this week, to be shown next Tuesday.

'After 173 very long days, it’s beautiful to get back to business as usual with our full team and two more wonderful regulars,' ABC President Ben Sherwood told the New York Times before the show.

Jessica Simpson, Bruce Willis and Rob Lowe, were among the guest hosts in Roberts' absence.

Hosts Elizabeth Vargas and Amy Robach also took turns filling in while she was away and will continue to appear on the show as Roberts gets back to full health.

Roberts left Good Morning America
 in August to undergo the life-saving transplant with bone marrow from her sister 
Sally Ann, who proved to be a perfect match.

In a recent interview with People magazine she recounted how she felt as though she was 'slipping away' following the surgery.

'I was in pain I had never experienced
 before, physically and mentally,' she told People magazine. 'I was in a coma-like state, I truly 
felt I was slipping away. 

'Then I kept hearing "Robin! Robin! I came out 
of it and it was my nurse Jenny... I saw her 
enlarged eyes above her mask, pleading for me to stay here. And 
thankfully I did. I came back.'

Battle: She publicly shared the details of her struggle with a rare blood disorder, myelodysplastic syndrome

Getting through: Roberts has turned to yoga to help with her recovery back to health

Treatment: Roberts was injected with three million of her sister's stem cells through a catheter in her chest

Precautions: After leaving hospital in October, Roberts wore a face mask and gloves to keep out germs

On her break she also suffered the devastating loss of her mother, Lucimarian, who at the age of 88.

After the funeral, she returned to New York for her treatment and the procedure, which was documented for GMA.

Wearing a face mask so she would not 
come into contact with any harmful bacteria, she returned home on 
October 11, despite fears she would be unable to cope outside the safety
 of the hospital.

She passed time at home by writing a journal, 'watching a lot of mindless TV' and recuperating.

But just as she was beginning to feel
 as though she was on the road to recovery, she was struck by the virus 
CMV, and 'was scared beyond belief' - although the virus cleared up within six weeks.

'Re-entry continues': The seven-year GMA veteran enjoyed a celebratory lunch with her co-hosts Champion, Elliott, George Stephanopoulos, and Lara Spencer ahead of the announcement of her imminent return

Famous fan: Even Hillary Clinton said she was looking forward to seeing Roberts back on her television

She lost 30 pounds over the course of 
her treatment, but she is now slowly gaining it back, and she is 
embracing her new look by skipping wigs.

Roberts was wary of starting back at 
work, but 'I miss my little drum roll in the morning and saying Good 
Morning America', she said.

She will also share her personal journey 
on a special edition of 20/20 which will air two days after her official
 comeback and will provide an insight into her recovery and how she has 
inspired others.
