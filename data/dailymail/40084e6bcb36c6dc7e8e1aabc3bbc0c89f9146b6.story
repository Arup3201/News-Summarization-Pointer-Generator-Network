In a new Quinnipiac University poll, Florida Senator Marco Rubio leads a tightly clustered field of Republican presidential hopefuls among registered GOP voters. But Republicans are clearly at a point of limited popular support.

The muddled field doesn't suggest a successful race in 2016 for Republicans, said Peter Brown, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.

'The Republicans are more disliked than Democrats,' Brown said. 'The Republican brand is essentially in the toilet these days.'

'The only place the Republicans do better than the Democrats is on the budget deficit.'

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had greater support than any Republican in the field, in a Quinnipiac University poll. Clinton is seen as the presumptive favorite to win the Democrats' presidential nomination in 2016

US Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio (L) topped the GOP field in the Quinnipiac poll, which included more than 700 Registered Republicans. Wisconsin congressman and 2012 vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan (R) was close behind

Senator Rubio was favored by 19 per cent of Republican respondents in the March 7 poll.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had 14 per cent support, slightly less than Kentucky Senator Rand Paul's 15 percent.

Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who served as the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012, came in second place with 17 per cent, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush rounded out the top five with 10 per cent.

Other hopefuls mentioned as possible GOP candidates, including Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.

'Three years before the nominating process, the Republicans have no clear favorite,' Brown said.

'What Quinnipiac found is there is no front-runner. Unlike in other years, when one candidate started out with a clear lead over other contenders, that's clearly not the case.'

But Republicans 'appear to have a deeper bench this time' compared to the 2008 race, he added, conceding that the analysis 'sounds a lot like scouting a baseball team.'

Combined, conservatives Rubio, Ryan, Paul and Bush attracted the support of 61 percent of Republicans, suggesting a tough road ahead for Christie, who is seen in most circles as a moderate.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, while thought to be among the most electable Republicans likely to enter the 2016 presidential race, trailed other candidates in the poll. Christie caught flak for appearing with President Barack Obama in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign, as the president directed hurricane relief fnds to the Garden State

Christie famously embraced President Obama in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, drawing criticism from Republican leaders because it happened in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign.

'It's clearly a conservative party,' Brown noted. 'The problem is that they have to have a message that appeals to people who don't think they [themselves] are conservative.'

Democrats scored better than Republicans on issues including health care, same-sex marriage and immigration.

But financial issues rate highest among the concerns of Americans in both parties, with 40 per cent listing the economy and jobs as the most important issue, another 20 per cent naming the federal budget deficit, and 8 per cent choosing taxes.

'Money will probably be a pretty big deal in 2016,' said Brown.

Health care and gun issues, favorite topics among liberal Democrats, registered less concern, with 20 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul (L) was an also-ran in the Quinnipiac poll with 15 per cent support, but the poll was taken a week before he galvanized conservatives' support with a lengthy filibuster over the question of whether the Obama administration could legally kill American citizens with drone strikes if they were considered terrorists. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) attracted 10 per cent of Republicans' support. The conservative politician would be the third Bush family member to live in the White House if he were elected

Overall, Democrats have a 38 per cent approval rating, with 44 per cent disapproving. But Republicans fare even worse, with 51 per cent disapproving and only 28 per cent favoring them.

The hyper-conservative tea party fared worst of all, with just 24 per cent approval.

Hillary Clinton, the former first lady and Secretary of State, enjoys greater public support than Rubio, but the Florida senator tops Vice President Joe Biden and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

The poll also found 59 percent of Republicans would rather see a state governor - not a sitting senator - as their nominee.

Ryan's status as the most recent vice presidential candidate won't help him, Brown said. 'History tells us being the running-mate on a losing ticket does not help one's presidential chances.

'Among the last six vice presidential nominees on losing tickets, none of them got to be their party's presidential nominee.'

Peter Brown with the Quinnipiac Polling Institute said that the Republican brand is 'in the toilet.' His poll found President Obama had a 50 per cent approval rating, and the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had greater support than any of the GOP front-runners. Quinnipiac University's polling arm regularly publishes presidential survey numbers, and often provides the first look at races that are far in the future

The last three on the Republican side were former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former New York Rep. Jack Kemp and former Vice President Dan Quayle, with former North  arolina Sen. John Edwards, former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen holding that distinction on the Democratic side.

None of them wound up winning their party's nomination for president after being the vice presidential nominee.

Brown said that in the 1980s, the Democrats were in a similar situation to what faces Republicans today. 'Their brand wasn't very good, there was a lot of internal strife,' but they recovered eventually with a surging Congressional field and Bill Clinton as president during the 1990s.

President Barack Obama scored a 50 per cent job approval rating in the Quinnipiac poll, which is up slightly from previous polling. His rating reached a high of 53 per cent in December, following his re-election victory, but dipped into the mid-40s by mid-January.

Fifty per cent is 'certainly quite healthy for an incumbent starting his second term,' Brown said.

The Quinnipiac poll sampled 1,711 registered voters overall, with a margin of error of 2.4percentage points. The sample included 712 Republicans, with a 3.7 percentage-point margin of error in that group.
