A father from Arizona, whose baby boy died when he left him in a car outside a bar, was sentenced to four years in prison on Friday.

Daniel Bryant Gray had pleaded guilty to manslaughter and child abuse after the death of his three-month-old son Jamison.

The 31-year-old had left the baby strapped into a car for several hours on August 28 last year, when temperatures reached 100F.

Gray chatted to colleagues at the Scottsdale sports bar where he was a manager, and was seen smoking marijuana after leaving his baby in the car.

Police said Gray had gone to the bar to do some extra work on his day off.

He helped kitchen staff with food preparation and asked an employee for marijuana before the two went outside to use the drug near Gray's car.

Gray discovered the baby when he returned to his car to get paperwork three hours later.

He ran back inside with the child still in the car seat and brought him into a cooler. 'I left my baby in the car and he's dead,' police quoted Gray as saying.

Gray tried fanning the infant, whose core temperature was determined to have reached 107 degrees. Employees and emergency workers tried CPR on the child, but he was later pronounced dead.

Investigators described Gray as distraught and emotional throughout his police interview.

He had been facing a possible prison term of up to 16 years, but had the maximum term reduced as part of a plea deal.

The baby's mother, Rebecca Hillary, was heartbroken by Jamison's death.

'He was my everything. I loved being a mommy,' Hillary told CBS 5 shortly after the death. 'He was a very happy boy. He was always such a good boy. He loved to smile. He just loved to smile, and play and bounce.'
