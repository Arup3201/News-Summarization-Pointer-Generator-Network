Olympic snowboard champion Shaun White has apologised after his arrest on Sunday for public intoxication and vandalism.

In a post on his Facebook page, the 26-year-old star wrote: 'I want to apologise for the unwise choices I made over the weekend and for any inconvenience it caused my family, friends, business partners, the hotel and their guests.'

The two time gold medallist was arrested early Sunday morning in Nashville, where he was attending musician Patrick Carney's wedding.

White added in the statement: 'I
was celebrating a happy occasion with a ton of family and friends and 
got carried away. I'm truly sorry for my poor behaviour.'

According to police, White 'pulled a 
hotel fire alarm, causing evacuations, then attempted to flee the 
scene,' reportsÂ People. He is also alleged to have smashed a hotel 
phone.

A concerned citizen 'tried to stop White from leaving the scene,' according to TMZ, with police saying that White 'allegedly kicked the person and proceeded to flee on foot.'

The chase ended when White fell and 
hit his head against a fence. He was then transported to a hospital for 
treatment and released on Monday, according to a spokesman for the Baptist Hospital.

Officers responding to the scene at the Loews Vanderbilt Hotel  in the early hours of Sunday morning reported that White appeared to be 'extremely intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol.'

However, source close to the sports star disputes early reports which claimed he vandalised his hotel room or spent time in jail.

Police said he was given the opportunity to sign misdemeanor citations and refused.

White attended the Summer Olympic 
Games in London, fuelling rumours that he is dating model Bar Refaeli 
when they attended a swimming event together.

The Israeli blonde, 27, sat next to 
redhead White, nicknamed 'the flying tomato,' as they watched the USA 
win the men's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
