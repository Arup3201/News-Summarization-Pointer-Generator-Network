He once said he had as much chance of becoming Prime Minister as being decapitated by a frisbee or being reincarnated as an olive.

But Boris Johnson now appears to regard the top job as not quite such a remote prospect after all.

In typically flamboyant style, he declared: ‘If the ball came loose from the back of a scrum, it would be a great thing to have a crack at.’

The sporting analogy marked a change of tone from previous interviews in which he slapped down questions about coveting the top job.

'How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck on a zip wire?' Mr Johnson has been dismissive of questions about his leadership ambitions in the past

Quite apart from his remarks about olives and frisbees, after he was photographed dangling from a zip wire in an Olympics publicity stunt last summer, he said: ‘How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck on a zip wire?’

But some months on, with David Cameron plagued by rumours of leadership plots, Mr Johnson took a more serious tone. He said: ‘I think it’s a very tough job being prime minister.

‘Obviously, if the ball came loose from the back of a scrum – which it won’t – it would be a great, great thing to have a crack at. But it’s not going to happen.’

His remarks emerged days after 
veteran MP Sir Peter Tapsell was overheard by Tory MPs telling David 
Cameron he would be prepared to stand down to allow him to return to the
 House of Commons.

He holds
 the Tory safe seat of Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire. Other MPs 
closer to London have also been rumoured to be prepared to step aside.

Mr Johnson was speaking in a documentary by Michael Cockerell who has profiled Margaret Thatcher, Ted Heath, Alan Clark, Barbara Castle and Mr Cameron.

What Mr Johnson says to the documentary maker is quoted in an article by Mr Cockerell in this week’s Radio Times.

His sister, columnist Rachel Johnson, tells how as a child Boris told people he wanted to be ‘World King’.

His mother – the painter Charlotte Johnson Wahl, who divorced Boris’s father, former MP Stanley, when he was a child – said she thought it was ‘a wish to make himself unhurtable, invincible, and somehow safe from the… pain of your parents splitting up’.

Mr Johnson also spoke of his ‘self-loathing’ at the raucous antics of the Bullingdon Club drinking society of which he and Mr Cameron were members at Oxford.

As ever, he shrugged off questions about his private life, claiming the public were ‘little interested in that side of things’.

Boris Johnson: The Irresistible Rise is due to be shown on BBC2 at 9pm on March 25.
