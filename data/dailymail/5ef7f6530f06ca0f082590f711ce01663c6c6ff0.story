David Cameron accused the BBC of misleading  listeners ‘day after day’ on the scale of budget cuts.

The Prime Minister said on a radio show yesterday that he wanted people to be given accurate figures on the austerity measures.

Mr Cameron was admonished on BBC Radio Merseyside for ‘unfairly’ hitting Liverpool with bigger cuts than his Oxfordshire constituency, Witney.

In a feisty exchange, host Roger Phillips said Mr Cameron was ‘so out of touch, it’s untrue’.

But Mr Cameron said local politicians had actually built up their reserves. He said: ‘One of the reasons people feel treated unfairly is because they hear on programmes like yours, day after day, week after week, sets of figures that aren’t accurate.

‘That’s why I’ve spent so much time, on your programme, giving you the accurate figures.

‘You’ve got me on this programme, you’ve asked me about these figures, you are saying Liverpool is unfairly funded and I want to give you the statistics so you can see that’s  absolutely not the case.’

He added: ‘Liverpool is adding to its reserves while making these  complaints, rather than drawing on its reserves, and there’s still  £6million of uncollected council tax.’ The Labour Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, had accused Mr Cameron of cutting the budget of one of the country’s most deprived cities.

In an article for the Liverpool Echo, Mr Anderson wrote: ‘When Cameron comes to praise Liverpool, he also plans on stabbing us in the back. Liverpool City Council is facing £156million of government cuts in the next few years. That’s on top of £176million in funding and 1,600 jobs the council has already lost.’

The city faces cuts of 5.5 per cent, or £30million, by 2015, while West Oxfordshire, which covers Mr Cameron’s prosperous constituency, will see its budget trimmed by a more modest 2 per cent. However, spending per household in Liverpool is more than ten times higher, some £2,636 compared to £205.

Mr Cameron admitted his constituents received less because they were richer but said Liverpool had a  ‘generous’ settlement.

Last week the BBC faced claims of bias over items on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme that criticised the Prime Minister and the Queen. Left-wing journalist John Pilger attacked Mr Cameron for mourning the death of Nelson Mandela despite visiting South Africa during the apartheid era.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has clashed with the BBC over its coverage of welfare reform. He accused the broadcaster of ‘adopting the language of the Labour Party’ by branding cuts to housing benefit a ‘bedroom tax’. In March, he said the term was ‘innately political’ and ‘factually wrong’.

In 2012, he accused then economics editor Stephanie Flanders of ‘pouring cold water’ on good news.

BBC political editor Nick Robinson said this week it had made a ‘terrible mistake’ in failing to properly reflect public concern over immigration.
