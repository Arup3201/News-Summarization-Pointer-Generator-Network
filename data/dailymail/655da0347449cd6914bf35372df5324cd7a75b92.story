Standing in a room filled floor to ceiling with old irons, pensioner John Rollins shows his astonishing collection of the trusty household appliance.

The 74-year-old has one of Britain's largest collections of irons - amassed during three decades of scouring fairs, antique shops, and auction houses.

He now owns a staggering 800 irons - which includes irons in all shapes, makes, sizes and colours, ranging from the first one he ever bought, a box iron right up to modern day steam irons.

Astounding: John Rollins from Newark, Nottinghamshire, shows off some of his collection of 800 irons

Prized: Mr Rollins amassed his extraordinary collection of irons over the past 30 years

And his record breaking array of gas irons numbers no less than 240.

But his passion for collecting irons has not quite stretched to using them – his second wife Avis, 67, still does all the ironing in the house.

'I suppose the daftest thing is that don’t even iron,' admitted John.

'Avis does all the ironing in our house. I’m absolutely useless at it.

'All of my shirts are pristine hanging in the wardrobe, but it’s nothing to do with me.'

Mrs Rollins said: 'John did try but he wasn’t very good at it, he ended up with more creases than when he started.

'I don’t let him use my iron, it’s modern and electric and I don’t let him anywhere near.'

Ironic: Mr Rollins confesses to being useless at pressing his clothes so leaves all the ironing to his wife Avis

Restored: Mr Rollins founds many of his collection in poor condition but he managed to restore them to good condition

Neither of Mr Rollins' two children have inherited their father's passion for irons, which was kindled more than 30 years ago.

Since then he has been gathering an impressive array of the everyday household item most of us wouldn’t think twice about.

It all started back in the 1980s when Mr Rollins had an idea how to make the hearth in his front room look a little less bare.

'I was walking around a scrap yard and I thought I’ll have that flat iron,' he said.

'I paid about a fiver, I cleaned it up and put it in the hearth. Things just grew from there.'

Bygone age: Many of Mr Rollins's collection would have been commonplace decades ago but are increasingly rare

History: An old photograph from around the 1900's shows how the irons would of been used in laundry factories

Since then retired engineer Mr Rollins has spent much of his spare time at antique shops and fairs following his passion.

He said: ‘I’m six feet tall and they tower above me.'

'I clean and dust them, it’s a bit of a task. There’s a dehumidifier in there to stop them getting rusty. It’s on all the time.

'Many
of them are rusty when I get them, I restore them, coat them in wax, 
then put them on display. I think it looks rather splendid.'

Cherished items: Mr Rollins has one of Britain's biggest collections of irons which he has amassed over the past 30 years.

Spectrum: Mr Rollins's collection includes models in a wide variety of colours

Dedication: Mr Rollins has spent the past 30 years searching for additions to his growing collection of irons

Posterity: Mr Rollins hopes he can preserve a bit of history with his collection of gas irons

But despite the size it’s not the 
biggest collection in the country. That honour goes to one of his rivals
in London who has around 1000 irons.

'At the last count I had 240 gas irons and no one else can rival that,' he said.

'People think "what do you need all those for, you only need one?" and I suppose they’ve got a point.

'But
for me it’s all about history, for every iron I’ve saved hundreds must 
have ended up in skip. I just thing young people should know how people 
lived in the past.'

Naturally he ended up joining the British Iron Collectors Club. There are about 120 members and they meet twice a year.

Rivalry: Mr Rollins, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, has a little friendly competition with other collectors to find the rarest or most prized irons in antiques fairs and sales around the country

Peerless: At last count John Rollins's collection included an unrivaled 240 gas irons

'For
some people it might seem like the sort of gathering where things could
get a bit flat, but we enjoy ourselves, swapping stories and irons,' 
explained John.

Mr Rollins has always said it would 'make his day' to own a GLC speckled green gas iron. He believes only 10 colours were made.

But
he’s not the only one scouring stalls and eBay. 'There’s lots of 
competition between members... friendly rivalry you know,' he said.

'There
are a couple of irons I would love to get my hands on, but I won’t say 
what they are. People might try and cash in. They are gas irons. That’s 
all I’m going to say.'
