An 18-year-old camp counselor is accused of sending sick anonymous taunts to a 13-year-old boy camper, including threats of rape.

Robert Yagid, from Davie, Florida, has been charged as an adult for aggravated stalking. 

Among the terrifying messages that Yagid allegedly to sent to the boy over the anonymous messaging app Kik, were 'Have you ever been raped before?' and 'You're so cute when you sleep.'

A very long threatening message detailing a sexual assault was sent to the boy in June, according to cops.

It read, 'Have you ever been raped before? Because that tight, white little a****** belongs to me now … You can call authorities, you can pray to God, but you will never find me. Until I've found you first,' it said, according to the affidavit.

'The devil has plans for you; it looks dim and full of sickness, consuming your body. Make amends to free your heart, and soul; for soon, there will be no going back.'

When the boy's mother discovered the messages she took them to Pembroke Pines police and obtained a search warrant.

'The suspect's actions caused him to be fearful and he believed that his life was in danger,' Detective Michael Silver wrote in the search warrant application.

That day detectives used IP addresses to find suspect Yagid at his house in Davie.

After showing the boy a photo line-up he recognized the photo of Yagid to be 'Robbie' his camp counselor. 

Cops say they confiscated Yagid's electronic devices and found a Google history that read, 'The Creepy Sex Manifesto,' 'Stalking for Beginners,' 'How to Ruin Someone’s Life,' and 'Paedophiles Guide,' according to a juvenile arrest affidavit. 

When police questioned Yagid as to why he wrote the messages he wrote that he was, 'just bored.' 

In February a judge placed Yagid on home detention, ordered that he wear an electronic ankle monitor and prohibited him from using the Internet, except for homework assignments, reports the Sun Sentinel. 

Yagid also was ordered to have no contact with the victim.

The owner of Camp Adventure Inc., which runs private camps out of the Broward County park has said Yagid had worked for two summers as a counselor-in-training and did not supervise campers.

The next step for Yagid is an arraignment before a judge in adult court. 

That hearing has not yet been scheduled.
