The 27-year-old co-founder and CEO of dating app Tinder is being replaced just months after an embarrassing lawsuit revealed that he had described his boss as a penis.

In July it emerged that Sean Rad had allegedly sent a text message in which he described Barry Diller, the head of IAC/InterActiveCorp, as a d*** along with a picture to illustrate.

The derogatory text emerged in a lawsuit filed by former executive Whitney Wolfe, 24, who claimed she was forced from the company and sexually harassed after her relationship with co-founder and chief marketing officer Justin Mateen fell apart.

Rad's text message was cited in her lawsuit as an example of the 'misogynist, alpha-male stereotype too often associated with technology startups'.

The immature ex-CEO is alleged to have texted Wolfe a photo of a piece of paper with Diller's name written across the top, followed by the letters 'AKA'.

Underneath it were Diller's initials 'BD', drawn in the shape of a penis.

Rad is said to have sent the offending text during a meeting with executives from IAC, the two-year-old matchmaking app’s largest stakeholder.

When news of the incident emerged in July, it was reported Rad would be safe, but the company has now decided to replace him with ‘an Eric Schmidt-like person’, reports Forbes.

Rad, who is expected to remain with the company as president and board member, learned of his fate as he was preparing to take the stage at Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia last month.

The derogatory text emerged in a lawsuit filed by former executive Whitney Wolfe, center, who claimed she was forced from the company and sexually harassed after her relationship with co-founder and chief marketing officer Justin Mateen, left, fell apart.

‘I went through every stage of mourning at once — fear, a bruised ego,’ he told Forbes. ‘I started thinking about the company and my whole future.’

Rad announced at the event that Tinder is launching a premium service – Tinder Plus – that will allow paying users to have more match-making powers and access to premium content like a travel feature.

Wolfe settled her lawsuit last month and was awarded an undisclosed amount of money, while co-founder Mateen is no longer with Tinder, or parent company IAC.

In her lawsuit she accused Rad of standing by and doing nothing as she was forced out.

She claims she was called a w**** by Mateen in front of Rad and was stripped of her co-founder title because Mateen told her that having a '24-year-old girl' co-founder made the company 'seem like a joke.'

The lawsuit also claimed that Mateen and Rad subjected her to a 'barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages'.

The lawsuit had also credited her with suggesting the name - 'because tinder helps to light a flame, which had obvious dating analogues'.
