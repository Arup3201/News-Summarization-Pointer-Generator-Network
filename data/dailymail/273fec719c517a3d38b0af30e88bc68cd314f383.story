Two men are under arrest after the body of a third man missing for almost two months was found this week in Montana.

Authorities arrested Russell Britton, 58, and Moises Mendez, 26, both of Boulder, and charged both with first-degree murder after Nathaniel Tallman, 25, of Lafeyette, Colorado, was found dead Thursday near Lusk, Montana - he had been missing since January.

No details on Tillman’s death have been made public, but the Daily Camera reported that Britton is being held in a Colorado jail without bond, and Mendez is locked up in San Diego on a $1million bond.

A mystery: Nate Tallman went missing on January 23, he was found dead this week in Montana

Tillman was last seen leaving his apartment just outside Boulder on January 23, according to the Denver Post.

His car, a 2014 Mitsubishi Lancer, was found three weeks later at a nearby office complex, said the Post.

It is not clear what relationship Tillman had with his two supposed attackers, how they killed him or what their motive was.

His family has also declined multiple opportunities to speak with local media in Colorado.

Authorities have yet to release the details of a Friday autopsy and were not immediately able to be reached by MailOnline.

It is also not clear how Britton was 
arrested, but police did tell the Daily Camera that Mendez was taken 
into custody by Customs and Border Protection Saturday afternoon.

Both
 Mendez and Britton have a prior criminal history, with the former 
having been arrested as recently as Feb 18 – three weeks after Tillman’s
 disappearance – for a misdemeanour charge of driving with a revoked 
license, records showed.

Mendez also has drunken driving, assault and menacing with a weapon charges dating back to 2006.

Britton has multiple criminal charges in his past dating back to 1983, when he was arrested for felony forgery. He was also charged with contempt of court in 1999, records revealed.

Britton is due in court Monday, it is not clear when Mendez will be in front of a judge for an extradition hearing.
