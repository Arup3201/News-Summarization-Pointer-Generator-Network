Jurors are deliberating the fate of a former justice of the peace convicted of killing a North Texas district attorney's wife in a revenge plot.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Eric Williams. He was found guilty earlier this month in the shooting death of Cynthia McLelland.

Ex-judge Eric Williams is convicted of killing a North Texas district attorney's wife in a revenge for losing his job. His estranged wife Kim Williams said on Tuesday that she assisted in the killing.

Prosecutors say Williams killed the three in a revenge plot after Hasse and McLelland prosecuted him for the theft of county equipment. He lost his job and law license as a result.

Williams' estranged wife, Kim Williams, testified before closing arguments Tuesday that the couple's mood after the McClellands' killing was 'happy, joyous.' 

The estranged wife of a former Texas justice of the peace testified that she was a 'willing participant' in her husband's revenge killings of a district attorney, his wife and a senior prosecutor.

Eric Williams was convicted December  4 in the shooting death of Cynthia McLelland. He is also charged, but has not been tried, in the deaths of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and assistant prosecutor Mark Hasse.

Kim Williams is also charged in the slayings. She testified for more than two hours Tuesday about her role in the murder plot.

'His anger was my anger,' she said.

Her testimony indicates she drove the getaway car in Hasse's slaying and helped to dispose of the weapons used in the killing of the McLellands at their home east of Dallas.

She said Eric Williams had a hit list that included former state District Judge Glen Ashworth and Kaufman County District Attorney Erleigh Norville Wiley.

'He told me if he ever decided to take everybody out, he was going to kill me too and then kill himself,' she said.

With Kim Williams' assistance, prosecutors have a gun linked to Hasse's death and a mask believed to have been worn by the gunman.

Williams said she has no deal with prosecutors but is hoping for some lenience when she's tried for the murders.

'I'm hoping for some consideration,' she said.
