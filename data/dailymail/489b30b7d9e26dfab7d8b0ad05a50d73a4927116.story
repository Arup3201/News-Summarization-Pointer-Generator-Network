Frank Lampard is to leave Manchester City at the end of the season and finally join his new club New York City in July.

Despite Lampard’s excellent form for Manuel Pellegrini’s side, the midfielder has made it clear he wants to take up the challenge of playing in the MLS when his loan spell ends in England.

There had been fears at New York City and within MLS that Lampard, 36, would be tempted to remain at the Etihad beyond the end of the season.

But it’s understood the former England midfielder wants to honour his contract and move to America after City’s season comes to an end.

Lampard, who played in City’s victory over Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday in the FA Cup, angered a section of his new club’s supporters when Manchester City extended his loan spell.

MLS commissioner Don Garber accused Manchester City of an ‘error of judgement’ after they invited Lampard to train with them following Chelsea’s failure to offer him a new contract.

Garber said: ‘I sensed this was coming, and it didn’t surprise me when they ultimately made their decision. You’re dealing with a very unusual set of circumstances.

‘Frank has become one of the most important players in Man City’s season, and he’s scored critical goals to have them tied for first place in the Premier League.

‘They were faced with a difficult decision. I’m going to be supportive of all our ownership groups, making them aware of my point of view.

‘But we need to work hard now to move forward and recognise that Frank will be joining this team in July along with other Designated Players, who throughout the history of the Designated Player programme have almost always joined in July.

‘If there was an error in judgment on this, it was not just announcing that he would come in July and figuring out how to manage the start of the season, no different than what happened with Robbie Keane or Thierry Henry or David Beckham.’
