Sam Allardyce felt Manchester City were fortunate to receive the 24th minute penalty which proved decisive at the Etihad.

James Milner went to ground in the Everton penalty area under pressure from Phil Jagielka with referee Andre Marriner pointing to the spot.

Yaya Toure stepped up and converted to give Manuel Pellegrini's men a 1-0 lead which they never relinquished.

'You can understand why the referee has given it but it's a soft one,' Allardyce told Sky Sports.

'If you give a penalty for that one, then you could be giving three or four penalties in a game.' 

Allardyce continued: 'Jagielka didn't have to do that. He didn't have to put his leg out.

'Milner feels the contact and goes to ground and now the referee has a decision to make.'

The West Ham manager heaped praise on Milner for his overall contribution as Manchester City cut Chelsea's lead at the top of the Premier League table to three points.

'I've worked with James at Newcastle in the past,' says Allardyce

'He's been playing in the League since he was 17. He's so hardworking and doesn't get credit for the way he plays.'
