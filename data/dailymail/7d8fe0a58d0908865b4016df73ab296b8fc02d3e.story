A stunning image of the Earth has been taken by Nasa’s Juno orbiter as it did a slingshot manoeuvre around the planet.  

The probe was able to send the image despite unexpectedly going into ‘safe mode’.

Juno sped up from 78,000 mph relative to 
the sun to 87,000 mph - enough momentum to cruise past the asteroid belt
to Jupiter, where it should arrive in 2016.

This reconstructed image of Earth is one of the first snapshots transmitted back home by Nasa's Juno spacecraft in the wake of Wednesday's flyby. Juno was due to be flying over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean

The $1.1 billion spacecraft will use nine instruments to probe deep inside Jupiter and reveal glimpses into the planet's origin.

On Wednesday, the solar-powered, windmill-shaped spacecraft slipped into Earth's shadow as planned, but engineers were puzzled when it emerged.

At closest approach, it hurtled 350 miles above the ocean off the coast of South Africa.

The space agency later learned that Juno had entered safe mode- a state that spacecraft are programmed to go into when they sense there's a problem.

This day side raw image of Earth is one of the 1st snapshots transmitted back to us by Juno. It was taken with the Junocam imager and methane filter at 12:06:30 PDT (19:06 GMT) and an exposure time of 3.2 milliseconds

Juno is a Nasa New Frontiers mission to the planet Jupiter.

The probe cost $1.1 billion and was launched in 2011.

The windmill-shaped spacecraft travels at 78,000 mph.

It has nine instruments to investigate Jupiter’s gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere.

Juno will also search for clues about how Jupiter formed, including whether the planet has a rocky core.

It will also study Jupiter's deep winds, which can reach speeds of 384 mph.

The spacecraft's name comes from Greco-Roman mythology.

The god Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief, but his wife, the goddess Juno, was able to peer through the clouds and see Jupiter's true nature.

Nasa said skywatchers with binoculars or a small telescope might have seen it streak across the sky, weather permitting.

Ham radio operators around the globe were encouraged to say ‘Hi’ in Morse code - a message that might be detected by Juno's radio.

Up until Wednesday, when Juno whipped around Earth in a momentum-gathering flyby, the spacecraft had been performed without problems.

Previous missions to the outer solar system have used Earth as a gravity slingshot since there's no rocket powerful enough to make a direct flight.

The Galileo spacecraft buzzed by Earth twice in the 1990s en route to Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet located 484 million miles from the sun.

Launched in 2011, Juno flew beyond the 
orbit of Mars, Earth's closest planetary neighbour, before looping back 
toward our home planet for a quick visit.

By space mission standards, Juno's Earth 
rendezvous was low-key compared with the Curiosity rover's nail-biting 
landing on Mars last year, which drew crowds.

Since flybys have been executed before, project managers predicted a smooth flight. 

Despite
a government shutdown that has prevented Nasa from updating its website
or tweeting, the space agency's missions continue to operate.

Earlier this week, Nasa’s newest spacecraft, LADEE, slipped into orbit around the moon.

Since the 1970s, spacecraft have circled or flown past Jupiter including the Voyagers, Pioneers, Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini and, most recently, the New Horizons barreling toward Pluto.

Missions have beamed back stunning views of Jupiter's trademark Great Red Spot, a raging hurricane-like storm, and its many moons.

Juno promises to inch closer to Jupiter than previous spacecraft, orbiting the planet for at least a year and studying its cloud-covered atmosphere and mysterious interior to better understand how the giant planet formed.

Juno's trajectory has carried it beyond the orbit of Mars and then back into the inner solar system where it did a velocity boosting Earth flyby on Wednesday to gain the energy needed to reach Jupiter
