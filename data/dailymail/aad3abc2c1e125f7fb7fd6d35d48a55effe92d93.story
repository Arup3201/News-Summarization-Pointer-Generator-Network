The two brothers suspected of planting deadly bombs at the Boston marathon told a man whose car they hijacked that they planned to go to New York, it has emerged.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his younger brother Dzhokhar, 19, seized a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle and held the driver hostage as they sought to flee from police late on Thursday.

They told the driver that they planned to head to New York, a senior official revealed, but it is not clear if they told the man what they intended to do there, the New York Times reported.

The latest detail emerged as police confirmed the brothers likely planned more attacks, and suggests they could have wrought even greater devastation on the U.S. after being undetected by the FBI.

Threat: Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told a driver they held hostage that they planned to go to New York

Next target? The men said they were going to New York, but did not reveal what they would do there

Boston police commissioner, Edward 
Davis, said on Sunday that police believed they had planned more attacks beyond the bombings at 
the finish line.

The men were armed with a small  arsenal of guns, ammunition and explosives when they faced police on Friday morning.

'We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at 
that scene - the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded 
and the firepower that they had - that they were going to attack other 
individuals,' Davis told Face the Nation on CBS News.

Authorities said the men made at least five pipe bombs and used four firearms. Among them were two handguns and a BB gun that they are believed to have used in a shootout with police on Friday.

Battle: The men were eventually stopped following gun battles with police, and authorities found a cache of weapons and bombs, revealing that the brothers intended on carrying out more attacks

Hideout: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in this boat after a massive manhunt

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following the shootout - where police believe as many as 80 rounds were fired - after being shot and then run over by his brother as he fled the scene in a vehicle.

During the gunfight, the two brothers detonated a pressure cooker bomb - lending credence to the theory that the brothers were planning further terrorist strikes.

They also unearthed an M-4 carbine rifle - similar to ones used by U.S. forces in Afghanistan - on the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in Watertown, Masachusetts on Friday night.

Davis claims releasing photos of the two
suspects 'forced them out of their hideout' and spurred them into 
Thursday and Friday's deadly night time car chaos and gun battle with 
law enforcement.

Close call: Authorities said that by police tracking down the men, they saved the city from further attacks

'It forced them out of their hideout and
they decided to commit further violent acts. But itâ€™s my belief that 
they were already manufacturing explosive devices. Further violent acts 
were inevitable,' Davis told The Boston Globe.

The suspects 'were not making those explosives for nothing,' he added. 'There was a plan there.'

Authorities are now investigating where the Tsarnaev brothers bought the weapons and explosives and whether they acted alone in the attack.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is still recovering from a gunshot wound to the neck, which is believed to have been self inflicted, and is answering questions from investigators.
