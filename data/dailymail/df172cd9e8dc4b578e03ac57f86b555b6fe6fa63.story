Dutch courage: workers at the foundry in Holland pour in the molten metal to create Notre Dame's new bell

Emmanuel
has been tolled to mark the end of the First and Second Wars, the 
liberation of the city in 1944, and major state occasions, as well as 
ringing on the hour. It was also rung on September 11, 2001 after the 
attacks on the Twin Towers in New York.

Much loved: once sacked by revolutionaries, Notre Dame is a favourite with tourists and its bells mark some of the most solem moments of recent history including Paris' liberation and 9/11

Ancient and modern: despite the sci-fi protective gear, the blend of metals to be used is a recipe dating back centuries

Clamped: the mix for the new bell is shut in place by workers at the royal foundry in Holland

The
foundry worked with the Technical University of Eindhoven to create 
computer software that would allow the foundry to design a bell as well as hear it. The shape of the bell determines how it sounds.

The
idea is to make music from the cathedral sound as it did before the 
French Revolution. Experts have found manuscripts indicating what note 
the original bell would have produced.

Eight other bells have also been commissioned for the 850th anniversary of the cathedral. After
the revolution, the north tower's bells were replaced in 1856, but they
will replaced again with bells made of better quality metal that will 
produce a clearer sound.

Some
of the bells were taken out of use when it was discovered that ringing 
them caused the building to shake, threatening its structural integrity.

The nine new bells will be inaugurated in February 2013 and will sound on Palm Sunday, a month later.
