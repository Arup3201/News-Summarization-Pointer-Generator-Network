First it was the Calendar Girls, now it is the the Calendar Boys as a vicar and members of his congregation show a little bit more than normal  – but it is all for a good cause.

The Reverend Alan Jewell and a number of his regular church goers defrocked for a calendar to raise much needed funds for their place of worship.

Inspired by the famous Women's Institute calendar, Rev Jewell and his 17 helpers hope their arty black and white pictures will provide money for St Nicholas Church in Halewood, Merseyside.

Calendar boy: The Rev Alan Jewell came up with the idea to shoot a calendar

A wide range of members of the 
community volunteered their services, including a farmer, a dancer, two 
firemen and a retired policeman all baring everything for the cause.

Rev Jewell said: ‘I keep bumping into people and they either have a copy or they want to know where to buy one.

'Most people think it’s hilarious, which is what it was always intended to be.'

Profits from the calendar will help pay for replacement bells and repairs to the church tower.

Simon Brown, who had the idea for the calendar, said a generous donation meant that printing costs had been covered.

And thanks to Cambike Photography in Runcorn which donated its services for free, all profits are going straight to the fund.

Mr Brown said: 'Sales are going really well. We’re hoping we can cover the cost of at least one of the new bells.'

Most of the pictures were taken over several months earlier this year on Olly Harrison (Mr August)’s Prescot farm.

As well as shots in wheat fields and climbing into tractors Olly said a sandy beach had been created from a pile of grain and a patch of grass outside the office had doubled as a football pitch.

He said: 'It was really hard finding a big enough patch of grass. We had to move the tractors across the gates so people wouldn’t see.'

Olly said the whole thing had been much more complicated than everyone had realised but he praised the work put in by photographer Chris Campbell.

He said: 'When I asked Chris to give us a hand he was only meant to be supervising equipment.

'But when he turned up he just had a better idea of what would look good. We said ‘you’re better. Can you take them?’ And then he ended up doing all the editing too.'

Alison Shacklady, chair of the Bells and Tower Appeal, said she was delighted how the calendar had turned out.

She said: ‘I think they’ve been incredibly brave. I’m just very, very proud of them all.'
