Martin’s got the moves

Germany’s Martin Kaymer got in the spirit after his country’s World Cup win. Asked to sign an inflatable golf ball by a youngster, he dazzled a small crowd with his keepy-uppy skills, signed the ball then volleyed it back to the fan.

Reed playing it safe

Rising American star Patrick Reed has good memories of the Wirral, having won the 2006 Junior Open at Heswall. Despite the scorching heat that summer, Reed played in his lucky waterproofs. He was wearing them again on Monday.

Lean machine Clarke

The
 Open lardy ranks have been depleted by the loss of Darren Clarke, who 
is at least three stone lighter than at Muirfield in 2013. The Northern 
Irishman has cut the carbs in his diet and been on a strict gym regime 
for six months.

Rose makes the top three

Golf rankings are calculated using finishes over the previous two years, and so change at a snail’s pace. Justin Rose’s leap from six to three on Monday was a rapid rise by the standards of the index. Bubba Watson, Matt Kuchar and Jason Day were pushed below him as a result.

The Open sticks to its roots

Whatever happens in Scotland’s independence referendum this year, it will not affect future allocations of Open venues. ‘The Open is golf’s most international major and will remain that way,’ said R&A spokesman Malcolm Booth. Three of the next four Opens will be in Scotland.

O’Meara out, Fisher in

Absent Americans are often a feature of The Open. Mark O’Meara withdrew this week, giving England’s Ross Fisher a spot. The 1998 winner has an elbow injury, while Steve Stricker is reducing his schedule and Charles Howell cited a ‘personal family situation’.
