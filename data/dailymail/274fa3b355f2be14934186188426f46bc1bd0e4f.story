They have never been the most tantalising of snacks – due in part, no doubt, to their use as a natural constipation remedy.

But now sales of prunes are soaring, driven by their growing popularity with health-conscious Britons, according to a report.

Endorsements by celebrity chefs such as Heston Blumenthal have also helped boost demand for the dried plums, which have recognised medical benefits due to high antioxidant levels.

Prunes, often written off as a cure for constipation, have become popular with British diners

The volume of prune sales has risen by 8.8 per cent to 5.5million tonnes over the past year, with the value of sales up 5.4 per cent to £26.2million, data from analysts Kantar Worldpanel shows.

Imports from California, the world’s largest producer of prunes, rose to 664 tonnes during January and February, 14 per cent up on  the same period in 2012.

Trade magazine The Grocer  said: ‘Brits are developing a serious taste for prunes.

‘Sales are soaring and retailers and manufacturers are putting the once-unfashionable dried plums into a growing range of products.’

Waitrose used Californian prunes in its Heston Blumenthal Christmas Cake. The chef often praises the snack

Much of the increase was  down to Brits snacking more on prunes, but sales have also been boosted by retailers using them  as an ingredient in an increasingly wide range of products, according to a spokesman for the California Prune Board.

She cited the example of M&S launching a prune-based brioche and a cheese containing the fruit  in 2012, and Waitrose using California prunes in its Heston Blumenthal Christmas Cake – one of its  top festive sellers.

The spokesman added: ‘Prunes are a versatile product, illustrated by their increasing use in food manufacturing over the last year.’

She said retailers such as Aldi and health food chain Holland & Barrett reported that they had seen ‘significant increases’ in prune sales in the past year.

Previous research has found that post-menopausal women can protect themselves against osteoporosis and bone fractures by eating around ten prunes a day.
