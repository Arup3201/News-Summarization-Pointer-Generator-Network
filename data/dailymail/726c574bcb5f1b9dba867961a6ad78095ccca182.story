Wayne Kinvig, 18, was jailed for eight months today for posing as a Burnley door-to-door charity collector

A teenage career criminal who posed as a door-to-door charity fundraiser because he got a 'buzz' out of seeing the faces of the people he was about to con was jailed today.

Wayne Kinvig, 18, from Burnley, went door-to-door pretending to collect sponsorship money for his 'sick little brother' only to spend the money on cannabis and items for his unborn son.

He admitted eight counts of fraud by false representation and was jailed for eight months at Burnley Crown Court after being caught when he knocked on a policewoman's door.

Victims - some as old as 77 - were so moved by his lies about his brother suffering from cerebral palsy they gave him money from their pensions.

Kinvig would knock on doors armed with a clipboard and a sponsor sheet attached.

He also carried information about Gift Aid which enables charities to reclaim tax on donations in an attempt to appear official.

Such was his confidence that he even targeted a house on the way home from an appointment with probation officers at a Youth Offending Team who were trying to tackle his behaviour.

The teenager told one victim that money was needed to pay for stem cell treatment, while telling a father of a disabled child that he was raising money for the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.

His luck ran out when he called at the home of a Police Community Support Officer who recognised him from a mugshot she had seen back at the station.

The court heard how the thefts gave Kinvig a 'buzz' because it meant he could see the faces of the people he was about to con out of cash.

The teenager started his criminal career in July 2009 and has 39 offences on his record - 25 of which are for theft.

Last July Kinvig first struck at the home of a 68-year-old woman claiming he was collecting money for a friend’s brother who was suffering from stem cell disorder. She handed over £4 to Kinvig.

He was arrested after a probation officer spotted Kinvig collecting money at the address.

But while on bail Kinvig embarked on his fraud again by turning up at the home of a man saying he had raised £34,000 for a cerebral palsy charity on a Duke of Edinburgh Award and needed £5,000 more.

The victim in his 20s handed over £2.50 and added his address to a form Kinvig was carrying on his clipboard.

One female pensioner handed over £1 when Kinvig knocked at her door, another handed over £2 when he asked for donations for a sponsored walk.

A man of 26 pledged £10 because he thought it was to help a local boy, but did not hand the money over up front.

A woman aged 77 gave him £6 after he said he was doing a sponsored boxing event for cerebral palsy and a 45-year-old woman donated £5.

The teenager then turned up at the home of Mark Lumsden in Burnley on the same day and told him money was needed for pay for stem cell treatment.

A 68-year-old gave him £4 after he said he was 
collecting for a friend’s brother who was suffering from stem cell
disorder.

A victim in his 20s handed over £2.50 and added his address to a form Kinvig was carrying on his clipboard for cerebral palsy.

One
female pensioner handed over £2, another £1 when he asked for donations for a sponsored walk.

A man of 26 pledged £10 because he thought it was to help a local boy with cerebral palsy.

A
woman aged 77 gave him £6 after he said he was doing a sponsored boxing
event for cerebral palsy and a 45-year-old woman donated £5.

Julian Goode, prosecuting said: 'Mr Lumsden has a disabled son, who at one stage was thought to be suffering from cerebral palsy, and wanted to help.

'He put his name and address down on the sponsor sheet and agreed to donate £5. He realised he didn’t have the correct money on him and asked if the defendant would come back the following day.

'Around the same time the following day, the defendant again knocked on the front door of Mr Lumsden, who had had every intention of donating money, but had not had the opportunity to withdraw cash. To avoid embarrassment, he did not open the door. The defendant was persistent and continued knocking. No money was provided.'

Kinvig was found out when he arrived at the home of PCSO Tracy Parkes and she became suspicious when he unable to produce any official ID.

Mr Goode said: 'She was off duty. Her son answered the door. She spoke to the defendant. She didn’t give him any money.

'She recognised the male to be someone who she had seen on a photograph a few days before. She made inquiries and contacted the police.

Defence lawyer Tim Brennand said that at the time of the fraud Kinvig was about to become a father, had no job, no money and no prospects.

Defence lawyer said Kinvig (pictured here on Facebook) 'was desperate to try and prove to his girlfriend he could get his hands on money to buy some things for the child'

Mr Brennand added: 'He was driven to this rather extreme way of behaving in order to think he was being a proper father.

'He was desperate to try and prove to his girlfriend he could get his hands on money to buy some things for the child. He wants for his son the life that he never had.'

But passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Robert Crawford told Kinvig: 'What you did was very spiteful, very mean and very well organised and such offences make people less likely to give to charity.

'What was particularly deceitful and spiteful about what you did was you pretended you were collecting for a child who suffered from cerebral palsy, and we all know what a horrendous affliction that is, in order to pull the heart strings of the people that were targeted.

'That means that people were being preyed upon to give you money because they felt sorry for the potential victims, for the people and the children who you said you were helping. It was a wicked thing to do.

'You were that confident you were prepared to do it immediately after leaving the Youth Offending Team, to carry out your frauds on the way home. That’s how confident you were. It gave you a buzz because of the fact that you had to see the people that you were going to defraud.'
