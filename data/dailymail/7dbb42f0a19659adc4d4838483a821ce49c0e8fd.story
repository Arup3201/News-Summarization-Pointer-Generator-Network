A £100,000 car ploughed into a family's back garden this morning - but when the startled homeowner ran out to tend to the driver, they discovered they had disappeared.

The Audi R8 left the road and careered through a family’s garden at 1am this morning.

It left a trail of destruction as it careered through a hedge and demolished a shed, bench and a fence before finally coming to rest on a rear lawn.

A crashing start to the morning: The super car careered through the garden but miraculously no one was reported to be injured

Children’s toys were flung in the air as the car - with a top speed of 196mph - skidded in Awbridge, near Romsey, Hampshire.

Homeowners Andrew and Paula Rigby, and their children Wilson, three, and Fay, one, were suddenly woken by the din caused by the car crash.

Paula, 34, dashed out of the house to see what had happened and tend to the driver but found the black car empty.

The homeowner and neighbours rushed out to see what had happened, but he driver was gone

The driver had disappeared and it is unknown what their condition is after the almighty crash.

She said: 'I heard a bang and thought it was the kids but then I heard voices outside, looked out and there was a car in the garden.

'It took a while for what had happened to sink in. I was shocked.

'I was very upset because my children’s toys were in the garden and they have been trashed.

'If it had happened during the day my kids may have been out there and could have been killed. It is horrible to think about it.'

Neighbours ran out of their homes to survey the scene.

The hedge was moved around 50 feet by the car, which left tyre marks in the grass. Toys including trikes and plastic skittles were scattered.

Paula said a similar thing had happened on two occasions at the property before they lived there.

It was lucky the house and her cars were not hit, she added.

Paula said: 'In the grand scheme of things I was quite relieved that no one was hurt.'

Police are investigating but have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident.
