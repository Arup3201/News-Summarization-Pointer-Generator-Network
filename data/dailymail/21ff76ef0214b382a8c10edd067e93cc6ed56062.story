Former N-Dubz singer Dappy leaves Guildford Crown Court today after he avoided jail despite assaulting a man while serving a suspended prison sentence 

Former N-Dubz singer Dappy has been spared jailed and walked free from court despite assaulting a man in a nightclub while serving a suspended prison sentence.

The 27-year-old prayed and thanked the judge as his sentence was read out and he learned that instead of prison, he would be subject to a curfew with an electronic tag.

The rapper, who was tried under his real name Costadinos Contostavlos, was found guilty in September of punching a football coach on the dancefloor of the Evissa nightclub in Reading, Berkshire.

Judge Neil Stewart told the sentencing hearing at Guildford Crown Court that he would give the troubled star a chance, taking his responsibilities to his two children and his remorse into account.

He decided not to activate his suspended jail sentence when sentencing him for the nightclub assault.

Instead the judge handed him a two-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, a four-month curfew with an electronic tag keeping him at home between the hours of 10pm and 5am and ordered him to pay a fine and compensation.

The singer was in court today for breaching a six-month suspended jail term by getting into a dancefloor brawl over a girl which left the coach with a bleeding nose.

The judge told the star: 'You have a thread of violence throughout, not at the high level, but it continues.

'You plainly have a temper. No doubt you have attracted unwelcome attention on a number of occasions and that takes a toll.

'That doesn't justify the sort of reaction characterised by these offences.'

The star, dressed in black trousers, a white shirt and black jumper with brown Louis Vuitton trainers and a red poppy, had his hands in a prayer position as he sat in the dock awaiting his sentence.

He had arrived with a large holdall ready for a custodial sentence and looked desperate, with his head in his hands, as the prosecution ran through guidelines for sentencing.

Waving at his friends and supporters in the court, he mouthed ‘See ya,’ - before he discovered he would walk free.

The court heard that the start of Dappy’s trial was delayed at the beginning of the year because he was in the Celebrity Big Brother house.

Jon Harrison, defending, said the rapper was struggling financially, having put his house up for sale to pay large tax debts he had run up.

Mr Harrison said Dappy had 'underlying issues' and wanted to 'address the root cause of his bad reactions to other people,' and would welcome having a curfew with an electronic tag to keep him out of clubs.

The singer has been seeing a psychiatrist, the court heard, who said the death of Dappy’s father had had a big impact on him.

Dappy was found guilty in September of punching football coach Devonn Reid at the club in a fight over a girl.

Outside the court Dappy told reporters that it felt amazing after he escaped jail and said it was the start of a 'brand new me' 

A district judge sitting at Reading Magistrates’ Court previously heard that a fight broke out on the dancefloor of Evissa nightclub last October because Dappy, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, began chatting to a man’s girlfriend and female friend.

Mr Reid was out celebrating his 21st birthday at the club in Reading, when he asked the rapper to stop talking to the women.

He said that the star 'popped my nose.'

Dappy denied the attack, claiming he had felt threatened by a 'group of six or seven big boys' at the bar and said he’d been pulled away by a bouncer before a punch was thrown.

Sentencing for the nightclub attack was adjourned at Reading Magistrates’ Court last month when District Judge Davinder Lachhar decided the matter should be dealt with at Guildford Crown Court.

She said this was because his latest conviction put him in breach of a six-month suspended sentence handed down for a previous affray and assault, which could now be activated.

His six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months was for affray and assault at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey, in February 2012.

Dappy spat at two teenagers, Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, both aged 19, leading to a fight in which three men were seriously injured.

The rapper was caught on CCTV slapping a man in a nightclub in Chelmsford in Essex earlier this year 

The rapper and the Celebrity Big Brother star was fined £800 for the attack 

The rapper and Celebrity Big Brother star was also fined £800 earlier this year for slapping a man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex. 

Leaving court today and flanked by his minders, Dappy told waiting reporters: 'I feel amazing. It’s a brand new me.'

As part of his sentence the rapper must take part in the Thinking Skills Programme for offenders.

The group programme helps people work on their self-control and problem-solving skills in order to curb negative behaviour.
