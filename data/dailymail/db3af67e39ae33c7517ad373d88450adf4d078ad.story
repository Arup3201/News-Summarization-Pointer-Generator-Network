Temperatures in Sao Paulo will be 10C lower than in London when England take on Uruguay on Thursday.

Forecasts suggest the weather in the Brazilian coastal city is set to dip quite drastically for the Group D encounter.

Tuesday’s temperatures will peak at 24C while the following 48 hours will see a drop to around 14C, with rain also set to fall throughout Thursday.

Meanwhile, back in London and nearby towns such as ‘Slough Paulo’, the mercury will rise as high as 24C.

England and Uruguay – both beaten in their opening matches – meet at 4pm local time. But while temperatures will be low, humidity is set to top 90 per cent given the expected rainfall.

England’s 2-1 defeat to Italy in Manaus on Saturday was played in temperatures of 30C, but the players insist they were not affected by the heat.

Wayne Rooney, whose place is under threat ahead of the clash with the Uruguayans, said: ‘To be honest, I can only speak on behalf of myself. I felt absolutely fine. The weather was not an issue.’

England's players will certainly have no excuses in the cooler surrounds of the Arena de Sao Paulo and they know that defeat would in all likelihood spell the end of their stay in Brazil.

Italy face Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte in the other Group D fixture where temperatures are forecast for 25C.
