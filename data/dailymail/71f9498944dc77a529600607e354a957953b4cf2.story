Aston Villa have made a £7million bid for Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley.

The 25-year-old, who has one year left on his contract, also has interest from Hull City and Everton.

Cleverley's advisers held talks with United earlier this month over a new contract and expected an offer to follow. However, with United tied up on trying to sign new additions and Louis van Gaal clearly not happy with some of the players at his disposal United will listen to offers.

They are not desperate to lose Cleverley but the player accepts he could become a peripheral figure and if he opts to sitting out his contract then United will be forced to try and sell now.

His former club Bradford have been braced all summer for a windfall as they are due a percentage sell-on from any deal and were aware this month's talks were a make or break time for the England international.

Cleverley was even made captain against Roma during United's pre-season tour but accepts his time at United could be at an end if United succeed in recruiting more midfielders before Monday.

Everton have a long-held interest in Cleverley and are understood to be the player's preferred destination should he leave.

United are reluctant to sell their players to any rivals with plenty of interest in Danny Welbeck also.

United have received two offers for striker Javier Hernandez from Juventus and Valencia while winger Wilfried Zaha has joined Crystal Palace on loan and Shinji Kagawa is attracting interest from Dortmund, Valencia, Inter Milan and Juventus.
