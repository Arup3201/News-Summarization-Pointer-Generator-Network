Scientists have discovered a new species of fish in waters more than six miles deep.

The researchers discovered the new breed of eelpout fish while combing some of the deepest waters in the world near the Kermadec Islands, north of New Zealand.

They also set new depth records for rattail fish and large deep sea cusk eels, some of the most abundant of the deep-sea species.

Scientists are thrilled at the discovery of the eelpout, a species not known to science before

The waters in which the team from the
 University of Aberdeen's Oceanlab are so deep that they exceed the 
height of Mount Everest. The scientists launched more than 50 fishing 
nets over the last 14 months to a depth 9,900 metres -Â  1,052 metres 
deeper than the height of Mount Everest, which is 8,848 metres.

Dr
 Alan Jamieson, the voyage leader, said: 'It's always fantastic to 
discover new species of fish and to find a new type of eelpout is a 
massive success.'

'It's even
 better for us because we spent most of the summer building the 
equipment that was used to find these fish and so it's even more 
gratifying to have success.

'And
 now, between this and the previous two expeditions over the last 14 
months, we have sampled from a depth range greater than Mount Everest is
 high.

'We are never quite sure what we will find on these expeditions to unchartered territories.

'We
 had set out to find out more about the deep sea fish communities and we
 were delighted to find both new species and new depth records for fish.

'But what we found was better than we expected and we can't wait to get back out there in October for another expedition.'

The new species of deep-sea cusk eel was found by scientists off New Zealand who set new records for the depth at which they were found

Because the waters the fish were found in are so deep, the fish are unable to see.

Dr Jamieson said: 'While the eelpouts, rattails and large deep sea cusk eels do have optical nerves, they are practically blind.

'They wouldn't be able to see a thing if they were at a higher depth as white light from the sun is too bright.

'They're surrounded by pure darkness at depths of the sea they live in, but jellyfish and shrimps give off a very, very dim blue light which eelpouts and the like can actually see.'

Dr Jamieson and colleagues from NIWA and Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa conducted dozens of ocean samples in seven days of sampling.

They took more than 6,500 photographs of deep sea fish and caught about 100 in total.

A new fish found in the rivers and creeks in the American deep south has been named after President Barack Obama.

Two scientists from Georgia and Missouri decided to name the five new species of darter they had found after American presidents.

The freshwater darter was thus dubbed the Etheostoma obama.

Ecologist Steve Layman told Scientific American: 'We chose President Obama for his environmental leadership, particularly in the areas of clean energy and environmental protection, and because he is one of our first leaders to approach conservation and environmental protection from a more global vision.'

The other species of darter that Mr Layman and his colleague Rick Mayden discovered were dubbed Etheostoma teddyroosevelt, Etheostoma jimmycarter, Etheostoma clinton and Etheostoma gore.

The biggest scoop was finding a new species of eelpout at depths of 4,250 metres.

A new depth record of 5,500m was also set for a rattail fish - a breed which have never been caught in the southwest Pacific before.

Another rattail fish - in depths of between 2,000 metres and 4,500 metres - which has not been caught in New Zealand waters for more than 100 years was also discovered.

And finally, large deep sea cusk eels were found at another record depth of 3500m.

The scientists onboard the research vessel RV Kaharoa used landers with cameras attached that free-fall to the seafloor, as well as baited fish traps to attract the animals.

NIWA principal scientist Dr Malcolm Clark said: 'The international collaboration enables New Zealand researchers to use scientific equipment we don't have, and to sample places that would otherwise be inaccessible, and hence unknown.

'The results from this deep exploration are giving us a much better understanding of biodiversity in the deep sea around New Zealand, and enable us to better assess potential risks to the ecosystem from future climate change and even human activities which may include seabed mining.

'Dr Jamieson added: 'A voyage such as this is testament to how feasible scientific research in the deep sea has become.

'It is no longer the inaccessible, out of reach, part of the world it once was.

'The technological challenges of the past are being overcome, and shouldn't limit our responsibility to learn about and understand the deep sea to help ensure the long term health of the deep oceans - one of the largest environments on Earth.'

The new specimens are being held at the National Fish Collection at the Museum of New Zealand.

The scientists also found a rare species of rattail fish, the first time it had been found in the south Pacific

The cosmpolitan rattail was first caught off New Zealand by the HMS Challenger in a global scientific expedition in the 1870s
