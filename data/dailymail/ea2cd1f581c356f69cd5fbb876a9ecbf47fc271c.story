Paying for it: Berlin social services paid for bed and board, clothing and German lessons for Robin van Helsum aka 'Forest Boy'

He cost Germany's social services department thousands after making them believe he had lived rough in a forest for five years.

But now 20-year-old Robin van Helsum aka 'Forest Boy' may have to pay back as much as £16,000 in expenses that police racked up accommodating him for nine months.

Berlin social services paid for bed and board, clothing and German lessons for the English-speaking Dutchman. They also gave him a staggering £200 a month in pocket money.

Ed Koch,
spokesman for the district youth welfare office, told The Telegraph: 'We will file a suit for fraudulent 
appropriation of youth benefits during the course of the week.

'We're going to 
demand this money back. Whether we ever see it again, we don't know.'

Van Helsum enjoyed Berlin's hospitality while maintaining the illusion he was a 17-year-old boy called Ray who had spent years living in the forest.

His rouse was exposed when friends from his old school in his hometown of Hengelo recognised him on the news. His stepmother then positively identified him to police.

It then emerged he had travelled to Berlin just days before re-inventing himself as 'Ray'.

Friends said Van Helsum left home because of 'personal problems' and to 'start a new life'.

But police warned that, if the incident proved to be a hoax, then Van Helsum could face a substantial legal bill for wasting police time.

Police spokesman Michael Maass told Die Welt at the time: 'It was a really frustrating case and took up a lot of time. That will have to be paid for and that will eventually end up at his door.'

'It's not longer a joke. If the story is made up then he deliberately took us for fools, and he could be liable for the costs.'

According to German news agency DPA, Robin VH was last seen in Hengelo on September 2, 2011, ahead of taking a trip to Berlin with a friend. This was just days before he appeared at the city hall as 'Forest Boy'.

Berlin social services are also annoyed with the boy's manners after he failed to say thank you or apologise for the hoax.
