Three former Barclays employees have been charged by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations they rigged Libor interest rates.

Peter Johnson, Jonathan Mathew and Stylianos Contogoulas are accused of conspiring to defraud between June 1 2005 and August 31 2007.

The arrests come more than 18 months after Barclays was fined £290m for rigging Libor, which is used to set mortgage rates and trillions of dollars of financial contracts around the world.

The SFO launched a criminal probe into the scandal shortly after the fine was announced.

Johnson and Mathew left Barclays in September 2012 while Contogoulas left in 2006 after four years at the bank.

The three were among 104 names of current and former Barclays employees who tried to keep their identities anonymous as part of a legal case brought by Guardian Care Homes.

The charges take the total number of individuals facing criminal proceedings for their role in the Libor scandal to just six, despite a number of banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS being hit with huge fines.

No-one has yet been jailed.

Tom Hayes, a former trader at Citigroup and UBS and brokers James Gilmour and Terry Farr were charged last year.

The criminal proceedings against the 
Barclays alumni comes as it is also being investigated by regulators 
over whether it manipulated foreign currency rates.

The
 arrests will come as an unwelcome distraction, with the bank under 
pressure to justify a bumper pay hike for investment bankers and lay out
 its plans to turn around performance.

Review - Martin Wheatley, Managing Director of the Financial Services Authority, said the Libor rate itself needed a 'complete overhaul' following the scandal which implicated a number of banks

The decision by the scandal-hit lender to increase its total bonus pool by 10pc to £2.38bn has put it on a collision course with shareholders.

Barclays (up 3.05p to 256.05p) has kicked off a two-week charm offensive to attempt to pacify investors ahead of its annual general meeting in April.

The High Street giant is desperate to avoid a backlash, particularly as shareholders have this year been given binding votes that allow them to block remuneration reports. A key issue at Barclays’ investors’ roadshow is likely to be why it sanctioned big increases in bonuses despite disappointing performance. 

Its ‘casino bankers’ enjoyed a 13pc pay rise, sharing bonuses of £1.57bn between them.

The huge windfall, which equates to £60,100 on average, was unveiled last week and came as the investment bank’s profits slumped 37pc to £2.5bn.

The key ‘compensation ratio’ - pay as a proportion of revenue - rose from 39.6pc to 43.2pc, despite Jenkins’ pledge to reduce it to the mid-30s over the next few years.

Insisting that the bank was on track to meet this target over the ‘medium term’, Jenkins sought to justify the bonus bonanza.

He argued the bank needed to ‘pay competitively’ and backed ‘pay for performance’, adding that this ‘was in the long term interests of shareholders’.

Jenkins added that Barclays has been struggling to attract and retain some of its top talent, particularly when competing against Asian and US rivals.

He indicated that he had received the approval of some the bank’s biggest shareholders.

But analysts predict many investors will be less understanding when given the chance to vote on the pay packages at the annual meeting.

Describing the bonus hike as a ‘poke in the eye for investors’, Gary Greenwood from Shore Capital said:

‘Barclays has not done itself any favours with the increase in the bonus pool, particularly at the investment bank. It has a lot of work to do to convince investors that they needed to pay more to retain top staff and must provide evidence of the revenues these top staff are generating.’

He added: ‘Barclays also needs to convince investors about its plans to boost performance at the investment bank. It has its work cut out’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
