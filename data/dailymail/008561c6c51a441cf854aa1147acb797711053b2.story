An Oklahoma teenager was burned so badly during an explosion that doctors said his wounds were typically only seen during autopsies.

Dalton Henry, 15, was burned while helping his older cousin burn brush, and though his memories of the day are fuzzy he admitted that he had been told several times to leave the gas can alone but did not listen.

Mother Carrie Henry told KFOR she saw the explosion from her kitchen window.

'I just prayed to God that it wouldn’t be bad 
and it was,' she said.

'I wish he would have just listened and not picked up that gas can,' she continued. 'It’s a very, very hard lesson for him, a very hard lesson.'

After he was injured in February, doctors told the family his road to recovery would be long and arduous.

The family has since set up a GoFundMe to help offset medical costs.

While progress is slow, his family said it is still miraculous.

'Sometimes they say two weeks, three weeks and it turns into months,' Carrie said.

And with several surgeries still ahead, the process has taken its toll on the family.

'I do my best not to cry every time I look at him,' she says. 'It just about kills me that he got burnt that bad.'

She's quit her job so she can take care of Dalton full-time, and says she now knows her son is a fighter.

'I said you fought. You fought hard,' she says. 'You know, you’re a strong boy. Never once did he cry.'

As he heals, he's been able to go fishing and even swim this summer.

'He’ll never be 100% back where he was, no. But even if it’s halfway 
or 75% back, that would be just awesome,' Carrie says.

And while most of the procedures have gone well the family is considering legal advice regarding the mishandling of skin grafts at a Dallas hospital that's left the teen missing two fingers.
