Masterchef and other 'creative' programmes are encouraging people to use their hobbies to set up businesses

The Conservative minister said the Government wanted to see more people becoming their own boss and had set up a Dragons Den-style business support plan to kick start a self-employment boom.

People on the scheme get help and advice from an expert who will help them write a business plan. If it is approved, they can get financial support through a weekly allowance over 26 weeks up to a total of £1,274.

Once a business is up and running, the mentors continue to give entrepreneurs on-going support during the early months of trading.

Ministers claim nearly 500 new businesses were set up every week over the last year thanks to the programme.

Ms McVey said: 'The most important ingredient when setting up your own business is a passion for what you're doing - and nothing beats turning your hobby into a career.

'If you're inspired by programmes like the Great British Bake-Off or the Big Allotment Challenge and think you could do it too – you could turn your cakes into cash.

'So far we've helped people set up more than 60,000 new businesses through the New Enterprise Allowance, and many of these started out as someone's hobby.

'Thanks to the expert business mentoring provided through the scheme, we've helped set up culinary businesses ranging from cake makers and a pastry business, to olive oil producers and bakers.

'And other hobbies have seen success too - whether it's renovating old carrousel horses or designing greetings cards, thousands of people have turned their passion into a successful business, securing a better future for themselves and their families.'

The New Enterprise Allowance helps jobseekers, lone parents and people on sickness benefits with a good idea to set up their own business.

The most recent figures show the scheme has helped budding entrepreneurs set up over 60,000 new businesses, with help from a mentor and financial support payable through a weekly allowance.

Over 4,000 young people, over 11,000 disabled people, and more than 14,000 over-50s have been helped to turn their hobbies into businesses.

Recent research from online print and design company MOO – shows that Almost a fifth – 19 per cent – of Brits with a creative pastime have pledged to make 2015 the year they begin making money from their talents outside of their main job.
