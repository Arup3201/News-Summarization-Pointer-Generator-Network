All work and no play is sure to make Prince Harry a dull boy when he solely focuses on his army duties during his trip to Australia next month.

In stark contrast to when the fourth in line to the British throne made his way Down Under the previous two times, his trip next month will revolve around training with Australian troops in army bases in Sydney, Darwin and Perth.

When the party boy Prince visited just two years ago, he relished in witnessing first-hand England's win over South Africa in the Rugby World Cup match  in Perth, and also joined in the festivities of the International Fleet Review's centenary celebrations on Sydney Harbour.

While on his first Australian visit a decade earlier during his gap year when the prince was just a fresh-faced 18-year-old, he had the opportunity to cuddle up to the country's indigenous wildlife at Sydney's Taronga Zoo.

But this time around, in what is believed to be a four-week assignment, the more mature and responsible 30-year-old, who is known in the British Army as Captain Harry Wales, will be participating in a 'challenging' training program specially prepared by the Australian Defence Force.

This comes as Prince Harry has announced he will quit the Armed Forces in June after his 10-year-military career.

Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the attachment will provide Captain Wales with an opportunity to gain greater insight into the Australian Army's domestic operating environment and capabilities.

'We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities,' he said.

'While all our units are highly capable, we have selected those units that best utilise Captain Wales' skill sets and give him some experience of the diverse range of capability we have within the ADF. 

Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the British and Australian armies have a shared military history with secondments, exchanges, bilateral training and professional development all part of a routine practice between the two armed forces.

Prince Harry's assignment with the Australian Army is an extension of his regular British Army duties where he is currently working alongside case officers in the Personal Recovery Unit.

'It will build on his previous experience with coalition forces along with his advocacy work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' Air Chief Marshal Binksin said.

'It is also an opportunity for Australian Army personnel to learn from their British counterpart and I know our Diggers will welcome Captain Wales into the ranks when he arrives in Australia next month.' 

He will take a short break to attend the Gallipoli Commemorations in Turkey on April 24 and 25 with his father, Prince Charles.

In May, he will then move onto New Zealand where he will undertake a short official tour during his first visit to the country at the invitation of the government.

After he quits the Armed Forces in June, he will travel onto Africa where he will spend most of the summer undertaking 'field-based conservation work'.

The prince will spend the European summer working alongside conservation groups in Africa, after which he will undertake voluntary work with injured servicemen while 'actively considering other longer term employment opportunities'.

In a statement Harry, 30, who has served in the military for ten years and seen two tours of duty in Afghanistan, admitted that it had been a 'tough decision' to leave the job he loved. 

Harry said today that he was 'really excited' about his future, adding: 'So while I am finishing off one part of my life, I am getting straight into a new chapter. I am really looking forward to it. ' 

But sources close to the prince said he had reached a 'natural crossroads' in his career and, after much soul-searching, had decided he had no desire to 'progress through the ranks'. 

'The Prince has had a fulfilling military career and considers it a huge honour to have served his country in the Armed Forces, during which time he has undertaken two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan, qualified as an Apache Aircraft Commander and spearheaded the Invictus Games,' a Kensington Palace spokesman said:

Prince Harry will spend the summer doing voluntary work with injured servicemen, following his success in setting up the inaugural Invictus Games 

A spokesman said: 'Prince Harry will spend a period of summer carrying out a programme of voluntary work alongside field-based conservation experts in Africa. He will focus his time learning how local communities in sub-Saharan Africa are working to protect and conserve their natural resources and wildlife.'

In September, Harry will return to the UK to work with the Ministry of Defence in a voluntary capacity with its Recovery Capability Programme.

This will build on his work on the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style event for injured service personnel, which he helped bring to the UK last year.

Kensington Palace said: 'In Autumn, Prince Harry will return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme, while actively considering other longer term employment opportunities.

'Prince Harry will continue to support Case Officers at London District's Personal Recovery Unit, working with both those who are administering and receiving physical and mental care within the London District area. This will enable him to continue developing his knowledge of the entire recovery process, placing him in an informed position to further support wounded, injured or sick servicemen and women into the future. '

The fourth in line to the throne will spend the summer working alongside conservation groups in Africa

During his first gap year after leaving school in 2003, the Prince worked with orphans in Lesotho, inspiring him to later set up the charity Sentebale - he is pictured here during a trip to the charity in 2014

Kensington Palace also stressed that Harry will continue to support the work of the Queen and the Royal Family.

In his statement Harry himself said: 'After a decade of service, moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision. I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had the chance to do some very challenging jobs and have met many fantastic people in the process.

'From learning the hard way to stay onside with my Colour Sergeant at Sandhurst, to the incredible people I served with during two tours in Afghanistan - the experiences I have had over the last 10 years will stay with me for the rest of my life. For that I will always be hugely grateful.

'Inevitably most good things come to an end and I am at a crossroads in my military career. Luckily for me, I will continue to wear the uniform and mix with fellow servicemen and women for the rest of my life, helping where I can, and making sure the next few Invictus Games are as amazing as the last.

'I am considering the options for the future and I am really excited about the possibilities. Spending time with the Australian Defence Force will be incredible and I know I will learn a lot. I am also looking forward to coming back to London this summer to continue working at the Personal Recovery Unit.

'So while I am finishing one part of my life, I am getting straight into a new chapter. I am really looking forward to it.'
