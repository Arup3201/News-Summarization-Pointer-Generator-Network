The biggest ever investigation into police wrongdoing could see officers involved in the Hillsborough disaster charged with manslaughter.

More than 200 serving and former officers are expected to be investigated over the 1989 tragedy and the subsequent cover-up, the police watchdog said yesterday.

Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said he will examine whether any individual or corporate body should be charged over the disaster, which left 96 people dead.

Liverpool fans remembered the fans who died at Hillsborough after the report revealed that they were not to blame

Senior officers could face trial for corporate manslaughter for failing to look after fans and botching the rescue operation.

Numerous others could face charges 
for blaming fans for the fatal crush, altering their accounts, taking 
blood samples from the dead for alcohol testing and providing misleading
 statements to MPs and the Press.

The report into the Hillsborough disaster has revealed 'troubling issues for police' as a new inquiry is launched

One of Britain’s most senior 
policemen, Sir Norman Bettison, will be personally investigated over 
allegations that he provided misleading information after the tragedy.

Sir Norman Bettison was referred to the IPCC

West Yorkshire Chief Constable Sir 
Norman, who was at the match as a spectator, was yesterday criticised by
 the Independent Police Complaints Commission for his ‘insensitive and 
inappropriate’ comments about the behaviour of Liverpool supporters – 
made the day after they were finally exonerated.

Margaret Aspinall, who lost her 
18-year-old son James in the tragedy and is chairman of the Hillsborough
 Families Support Group, welcomed the IPCC investigation.

‘The truth is out there,’ she said. 
‘I think the time is now for accountability. The families are all 23 
years older than we were in 1989. It’s taken up a lot of our lives.

‘We want to be able to grieve in peace, but we can’t until this has all been resolved.’

Families hope Attorney General 
Dominic Grieve will ask the High Court to quash the now-discredited 
verdict of accidental death from the original inquests and order a new 
hearing.

The IPCC’s launch of the 
investigation comes a month after a report was published which said up 
to 41 of the victims could have been saved.

The report, by the Hillsborough 
Independent Panel, claimed a cover-up was staged to shift blame on to 
the victims of the disaster, which took place during the FA Cup 
semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield 
Wednesday’s stadium.

Trevor Hicks lost two daughters in the Hillsborough disaster has previously called on West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable, Sir Norman Bettison to stand down

Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said it raised ‘serious and troubling’ questions for the police.

‘They are the allegations that go to 
the heart of what happened at Hillsborough in April 1989 and individuals
 and institutions may be culpable for the deaths,’ she added.

Mr Starmer said: ‘The purpose of this
 investigation is to identify what the focus of any further criminal 
investigation should be in order for the Crown Prosecution Service to 
determine whether this is now sufficient evidence to charge any 
individual or corporate body with any criminal offence.’
