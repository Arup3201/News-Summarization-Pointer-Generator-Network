At nine months old, babies, if they are really advanced, might be crawling around on the floor, or shuffling from A to B.

However, this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard.

Jorge Tirado, 43, captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a GoPro camera, and uploaded online. 

Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board

The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave.

Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves.

Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico.

Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave

Although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers, the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying: 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone.

'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 

'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.' 

In the video, Jorge can be seen holding his son, who is unnamed, and getting him ready for a day's surfing.

Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water

The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board.

At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him.

But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer.

While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age.

Pro-surfer John John Florence, 22, for example, has said that he was only six-months-old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves.
