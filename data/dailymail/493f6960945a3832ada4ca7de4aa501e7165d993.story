Shark attack:  Adam Strange was attacked at Muriwai Beach on Aucklands west coast of New Zealand

Police fired 20 shots at a great white shark as they tried desperately to save a father killed while swimming off a beach yesterday.

Adam Strange, 46, an award-winning film and TV director, waved and called for help as the shark dragged him underwater only 200 yards from hundreds of beachgoers.

Police and lifeguards launched a frantic rescue effort as about four other sharks joined in the attack off Muriwai Beach, north of Auckland, at around 1.30pm.

The father of one lived locally and was known to the traumatised young lifeguards who joined the fight to save him.

Pio Mose was in a group fishing on rocks near the beach when he saw a ‘huge’ shark attack the lone swimmer 50 yards from where he was standing.

‘All of a sudden we saw the shark fin and next minute, boom, attack him and then blood everywhere on the water,’ said Mr Mose.

He said the man appeared to struggle with the shark before it swam away – and then it, and  others, came back.

Mr Mose called the police on his mobile while a friend ran for help.

He said: ‘He was still alive. He put his head up. We called him to swim over the rock to where we were.

‘He raised his hand up and then while he was raising his hand we saw another attack pull him in.’

Mr Mose said that as blood filled the water, three or four more sharks arrived. The fishermen were forced to watch as the shark carried the man’s body out to sea.

‘It’s awful – like a nightmare. I was shaking, scared, panicked.’

At least three sharks are believed to have been involved in the attack

Mr Mose, who said he had never seen 
sharks before despite fishing in the area for three years, added: ‘All I
 was thinking was I wanted to jump in the water and help, but I didn’t 
want to get attacked, too.’

Police rushed to the scene and 
officers in a helicopter guided another on board a rubber boat to where 
the 12ft to 14ft shark was swimming near the victim.

He then fired around 20 shots into the
 water, witnesses said. It was unclear if the shark had been killed. 
Inspector Shawn Rutene said he could not confirm whether the shark that 
was shot, and which ‘rolled away’ as a result, was involved in the 
initial attack.

He refused to say if it was attacking Mr Strange at the time. Police took 30 more minutes to retrieve his body.

Adventure lover Mr Strange had worked 
all over the world, according to his website. His short film Aphrodite’s
 Farm was in ten major festivals and last year won the Crystal Bear 
award for best short film at the Berlin Film Festival.

He had also been a finalist at the London International Awards.

His wife Meg was last night being comforted at their home, not far from the beach.

His family, some of whom live 
overseas, said in a statement Mr Strange was a ‘glorious’ person, a 
‘great father, husband and friend.’
