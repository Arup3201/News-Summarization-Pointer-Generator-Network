A former Great Britain runner jumped on to railway tracks and was hit by a train when he was told his prostate cancer had returned.

Former Welsh 1,500m champion Clive Thomas spiralled into depression after doctors broke the devastating news that his cancer had resurfaced and he would need to start chemotherapy. 

The father-of-two, who went on to coach aspiring athletes at the prestigious Millfield public school in Somerset, had been become increasingly paranoid that the anti-depressants he was taking would cause him to harm himself or his loved ones, an inquest heard.

After growing paranoid and warning his partner Susan Adams to 'protect herself' from him, he fled her home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and was discovered hours later on the railway tracks  around five miles away.

The inquest in Basingstoke today heard how Mr Thomas probably jumped from a bridge in the middle of the night and lay undiscovered until he was struck by an early morning train.

He was still alive when emergency services arrived on the scene but had suffered devastating head injuries and died on the tracks as paramedics tried to resuscitate him.

The former long distance runner represented Great Britain in a 3,000m steeplechase race in Dieppe, France in 1975, recording a time of eight minutes and 37 seconds which would have made him the fastest Welshman in 2014.

He once ran a mile in four minutes and one second and the 5,000 metres in 13 minutes and 42 seconds. 

He was also a coach and vice-chairman at the running club Wells City Harriers, where he helped bring through Team GB runners Frank and Ben Tickner.

His partner Susan Adams told the hearing how she had met Mr Thomas in 2010 when they were introduced to each other by a mutual friend. 

The former runner was recovering from the death of his wife and Mrs Adams, herself widowed, was asked to provide moral support.

Their romance quickly blossomed after they went on a Caribbean cruise together, but the couple did not marry.

She said the 67-year-old, who had previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act after suffering depression, had been talking about having 'black thoughts' in the days before his death.

'He said he didn't feel right since the biopsy but couldn't give an exact reason for not feeling right. He was worried about the cancer, his mortality, a long drawn out death and being locked up again for mental health issues.'

After his running career, Mr Thomas taught at the prestigious Millfield School (pictured) in Somerset 

In a statement read out to the inquest, experienced train driver Dave Keats said he had originally thought there was a bag of chips on the line, before realising when he was 'about 10 feet away' that it was the body of a man.

Speaking about the incident, which took place on September 21 this year, he said: 'I originally thought it was a young male who had been drinking and fallen off the bridge. There hadn't been any trains in that area for seven hours or so, so I thought the male could have been there for quite some time.'

North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said: 'He clearly steals away from home in a very agitated state, there are a variety of things he could have done but what he does is go down to the railway line and jumps from the bridge. It's not immediately outside his house, it's a journey he had to make...he had a plan.'

A jury of four men and three women ruled that Mr Thomas killed himself whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed.

The inquest was attended by Mr Thomas' sons Neal, 40, and Alan, 38, who both live in London.

After the hearing Neal said: 'He was a much-loved man. It's a big loss to us. Today has been difficult, but we can kind of move forward a little bit now that we've got the verdict.'
