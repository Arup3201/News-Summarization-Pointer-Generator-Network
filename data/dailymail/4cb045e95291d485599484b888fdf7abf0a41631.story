In a significant boost to Chancellor George Osborne, forecasters have claimed the British economy will be larger than Germany's by 2030

The British economy will be larger than Germany’s by 2030, forecasters have claimed.

In a significant boost to Chancellor George Osborne, analysis also suggests that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world’s fifth largest economy.

The promising forecast will be an embarrassment to Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is still haunted by his praise for French president Francois Hollande, now leading a faltering economy with record levels of unemployment.

And the analysis also claims that within the next two decades, Germany, held back by a declining population and the weakness of the euro, could be overtaken by the UK for the first time since 1954.

The projections, in the World Economic League Table by the influential City think-tank the Centre for Economic and Business Research, will make encouraging reading for Mr Osborne.

They demonstrate that even though the most recent data shows growth was not quite as robust as at first thought in 2014, the UK’s total output overtook France’s.

The growth in Britain’s national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries.

CEBR’s league table tracks the size of different economies around the globe and projects changes over the next decade. In 2013, the US and China were the largest economies, with Japan and Germany next. France came in fifth, while the UK was just behind.

One of the most startling findings from the latest analysis is the gradual erosion of Germany’s position as Europe’s locomotive nation. ‘Germany slides back, held back by a declining population and the likely weakness of the euro.

In 2030 Germany, which was the world’s third largest economy, is overtaken by the UK for the first time since 1954 to drop to seventh place in the league,’ notes CEBR’s chief executive Douglas McWilliams.

Russia, which has been under enormous pressure from Western sanctions over Ukraine, the falling oil price and the tumbling rouble, looks set to remain a second-rate economic power.

It has now slipped from eighth to tenth place in the global league and it will remain there in 2030 despite the country’s enormous wealth of natural resources. The CEBR’s World Economic League Table also finds that emerging economies are set to grow even more quickly than expected.

India’s ‘unstoppable rise’ will continue, overtaking the UK to become the largest economy in the Commonwealth in 2018. And China is set to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in 2025 – three years earlier than previously thought.

Mr McWilliams added: ‘The league table brings things back to hard figures. Countries who have invaded neighbouring countries and whose leaders spout aggressively nationalistic rhetoric are brought down to earth by their falls in the league table as their economies collapse.

‘It also shows the dramatic changes now taking place in the world’s economic geography, with slow-growing European economies falling back and Asian economies catching up.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The news from the Centre for Economic and Business Research that the UK is moving up the world economic league table shows that the British people’s hard work this year is paying off and that the economic plan is working.

‘But the Government is the first to say the job is not done, so we need to carry on working through our economic plan that is securing a resilient economy and a better future.’
