Made In Chelsea stars Alexandra ‘Binky’ Felstead and Millie Mackintosh are both patients at Mervyn Druian’s London Centre For Cosmetic Dentistry.

Dr Druian says naturally gleaming  teeth like theirs are always preferable to the artificial, fully veneered finish favoured by the girls from their rival reality show The Only Way Is Essex.

He says: ‘TOWIE people tend to be bigger, more brash personalities – they want these big white teeth. It’s  one-upmanship to have the whitest teeth possible.

‘They often want whiter veneers than we would give them. I’d never let a patient walk out looking foolish. We have turned people away because we don’t think they need veneers.’

He adds: ‘My perfect veneers don’t look like veneers, they look like teeth. '

'I want my patients to be told they look really well. I don’t want them to be asked what work they’ve had done.’

In addition to whitening treatments, Binky Felstead had a chipped front tooth repaired by Dr Druian after an accident last week when her car went over a bump while she was drinking from a glass bottle.

He says: ‘We used a filling material that blended in so well it looked invisible.’

He adds: ‘Millie has only ever had whitening with us. She’s been in a couple of times and is a lovely girl with very nice teeth.’

Millie, he says, doesn’t need veneers – and nor do scores of others wanting better, brighter teeth.

‘There are lots of ways to make teeth look better. You  can try invisible braces – which a dentist can do  – or whitening.’
