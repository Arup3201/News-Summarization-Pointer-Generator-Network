Ahead of Saturday's mouth-watering clash between Liverpool and Chelsea, Sportsmail spoke to Stamford Chidge and David Tyrer of live4liverpool to better understand the intense rivalry between the two sets of supporters

Has your opinion of Liverpool/Chelsea changed since the match last April – and what was watching that match like? 

Stamford Chidge: Not really! To be fair they played very well last season albeit with the advantage of only playing once a week and with Luis Suarez, who is clearly one of the best strikers in the world. But we all felt that they wouldn’t be able to continue that form and their challenge for the title this year.

Obviously it was pretty tense as all the big matches are, but there were moments of pure hilarity seldom experienced at a football match, such as Steven Gerrard’s slip for Demba Ba’s goal; Liverpool’s increasing desperation with frequent 30 yard shots; Fernando Torres passing to Willian for the second goal and Jose Mourinho’s subsequent celebration with the Chelsea supporters after it, and the knowledge that we had well and truly ruined Liverpool’s party! 

David Tyrer: Not at all. I respect they did what they needed to get a result but that's all. It was one of the most painful games to watch - you could literally feel the title slip away over 90 minutes. 

What is it about Liverpool/Chelsea you dislike so much?

SC: How long have you got? Their sense of entitlement rankles most – just because they were a great side for 10 years in the 70s and 80s their belief that they deserve respect and have a divine right to win.

The obvious media love in around Liverpool lauding the so called ‘greatest supporters in the world’ and their constant wallowing in ‘history’ compounded by their constant jibes at us for having ‘no’ history and being all ‘plastics’. All clubs have history and all clubs have a proportion of ‘plastic’ fans. They’re arguments are farcical.  

DT: I liked Chelsea in the late 90s but they were really the first of the 'new money' clubs and everything about the club just feels 'false'. They're also very privileged and those plastic flags, well.. The less said 

Are these the fans you can't stand more than anyone else in the league?

SC: That’s actually more difficult than it sounds – it very much depends on how old you are and where you grew up – some Chelsea supporters will always say Spurs are the fans they can’t stand most and some might say Man Utd; others go back to the rivalry with Leeds, whilst new supporters might say Arsenal or even Man City. 

I was a teenager when Liverpool were winning everything so that has always grated, but there is no doubt the bitterness has been accentuated by the frequent big games we had with them during Mourinho’s first stint, and the issues around Rafa Benitez – that and their clear enmity towards us in recent years. I can remember a time when they weren’t bothered with us, probably as we posed no threat then.

DT: To be honest, it's a toss up between them and United for me. Everton fans can be insufferable after derbies but a lot of friends and family are Blues and it's usually more harmless but those two sets of fans are known for being a little nasty.

How many Liverpool players would get in your side?

SC: None – well maybe one or two in the Chelsea women’s team (laughs)

How many Chelsea players would get in your side?

DT: Maybe more than I'd like to admit, at present. Petr Cech or Thibaut Courtois in an instant, and I've also been a long-time admirer of Branislav Ivanovic. Nemanja Matic could be the difference in any midfield battle, while Cesc Fabregas has matured into one of the best midfielders around. So I'd take 3-4 - but not Costa. I think he's very handy but I don't think he'd suit our style. Like Mario Balotelli, he'd slow things down too much. Watched him do that for Spain at the World Cup!

Cesc Fabregas has been in stunning form for Chelsea since signing from Barcelona in the summer

Diego Costa has scored nine goals in eight Premier League games for Chelsea

Will Liverpool win the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers?

SC: No – Suarez and last season was his chance. He has a lot to learn in terms of navigating a season on four fronts (especially in managing a European campaign and challenge for the Premier League). The fact that he has perhaps spent the Suarez cash unwisely and failed to address Liverpool’s defensive issues hint at an arrogance and tactical naivety that could be his fatal flaw.

DT: I'm torn but I'd like to think Rodgers has a bit more about him than he's given credit for so, yes. He may be a bit egotistical but look at where an ego has got Mourinho. You don't get anywhere at the top end of the game without one any more.

Will Chelsea win the Premier League this year under Mourinho?

SC: There is a way to go yet but I’m feeling pretty confident. Mouinho clearly wants it and so far we have been the best team in the league. Manuel Pellegrini looks to losing the plot at City, Louis van Gaal has a lot to do to repair the inherent damage at United, Arsenal and Arsenal Wenger still haven’t learned their lessons and are flat-track bullies at best, and Liverpool are a shadow of last year without Suarez. I am confident we will be champions but I don’t like counting my chickens!!

DT: At the moment, who has the players or (in City's case) the form to stop them? I think they're definitely favourites but all it takes is one or two injuries, suspensions and they're in the same boat as everybody else. They've got the squad to cope but I think there'll be one or two twists and they might be run away with it the way people are expecting.
