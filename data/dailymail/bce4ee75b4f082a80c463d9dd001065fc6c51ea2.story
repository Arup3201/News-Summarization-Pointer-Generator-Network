The message, as Neil Jenkins relaxed at his al fresco media conference overlooking Rome’s Central Park, was that Wales have not even thought about the maths.

The Wales assistant coach insisted his squad are not interested in points- difference — just winning a Test match against Italy. They have piped a respectful tune towards today’s opponents but there is a title on the line and head coach Warren Gatland knows that his side must go for the juggernaut victory at the Stadio Olimpico.

The Kiwi needs his back line to go full throttle and take every point they can to close the gap on England and Ireland. Wales were heaped with praise for their defensive display last week but — with the wingers in danger of not scoring a try all tournament for the first time since 1995 — wing Liam Williams is ready to shift the focus towards attack.

Neil Jenkins says the first objective is to win the game

‘We know a lot of things need to happen,’ said Williams. ‘We are on first so we’ll go out, do the business and then sit back and watch the other matches. It would be nice for one of us wingers to get on the scoresheet, but it isn’t about me or George North getting across the line. The only thing that matters is getting the job done.’

Williams and North both scored during last year’s 51-3 rout of Scotland on the final day of the competition. A similar scoreline in Rome would make Gatland’s side big favourites for the title although they would have to wait for their reward as the new trophy is already at Twickenham and its replica in Edinburgh.

For Williams, it is a chance to silence his critics once and for all. The 23-year-old Scarlet, formerly a blast-furnace worker, was targeted on social media during last year’s tour of South Africa.

His shoulder charge gave the Springboks a decisive penalty try and he was then sent off in his first club game of the season. Williams was ordered to improve his discipline and has subsequently conceded one penalty in six Tests, compared to 13 in his first 16.

‘I had to learn the hard way,’ he said. ‘Some didn’t want me to be picked in a red shirt again. I had quite a lot of stick, but it goes in one ear and out the other. On Twitter, I just blocked people who were having a go. It was rubbish, really. You don’t need it.

‘I hope they’re happy that I’ve started four out of five games in this Six Nations. I’ve worked on my discipline and it’s going well. I’m trying to handle situations differently — do what I have to do and then get out, instead of getting involved in stupid things. Keep my body in the oven and my head in the freezer.’

Sharing his surname with famous predecessors — JPR, Shane and Martyn to name three — Williams will now hope to match their big-game temperament. He will look to the forwards to provide a platform for victory — although the front-row casualty list is a worry — but it is up to the back line to deliver a title-winning scoreline.

The absence of Sergio Parisse is a huge boost for Wales. The Italy captain has a foot injury and the odds of Wales winning the title shifted when his omission was confirmed.

But, sticking to message, Jenkins talked up the quality of his cover. ‘He caused us a lot of problems last year,’ he said. ‘He is a fantastic player, a world-class No 8, and if he’s not playing they are going to miss him. But they have good players in their back row. Sergio didn’t play two years ago but they were pretty strong.’

Parisse’s absence should temper Italy’s gung-ho approach while the captaincy has been handed to hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini.

Wales centre Jonathan Davies said this week that Ireland should ‘fear the wounded animal’ of Scotland, but Italy are also limping after losing to France so Wales must also be on their guard.

‘We’ve got more than one point to prove,’ said Ghiraldini. ‘Everything starts from our first phase and our scrum has to be at its best. We have guys like Martin Castrogiovanni, Michele Rizzo and Mauro Bergamasco with good experience. Sergio is a big loss — he could play in every national team in the world — but we have to keep believing.’
