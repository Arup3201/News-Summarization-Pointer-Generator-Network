A stepfather who murdered his stepson called 911 and claimed the boy had suffered a seizure, according to authorities.

Michael Mercado, 25, was looking after two-year-old Dionicio Mendoza alone at their home in Irving, Texas on Wednesday afternoon when he called 911 to say the boy was ill.

When emergency services arrived, Dionicio, who had no history of health issues, had obvious signs of trauma, including bruises and injuries over his body and internal injuries, police told FoxDFW.

The youngster was transported to Children's Medical Medical Center Dallas and was placed on a ventilator. 

Accused: Michael Mercado, 25, has been accused of capital murder in the death of Dionicio Mendoza, right

Loss: The boy's mother, Gaby, was at work while Mercado looked after the two-year-old alone on Wednesday

But on Friday, doctors declared him brain dead and he was taken off life support. He passed away on Saturday afternoon and his family have donated his organs.

An autopsy is still underway to determine his cause of death.

Police questioned Mercado on what had happened and his description of what happened was inconsistent with the child's injuries, they said.

The boy's mother, who has two other sons, was at work at the time. 

Mercado was arrested on Friday night and charged with capital murder.

He is currently in the Irving Jail with no bond. Police said their investigation is ongoing. 

Hurt: The youngster was rushed to hospital with external and internal injuries and was declared brain dead

Heartbreaking: The little boy, the youngest of three brothers, passed away on Saturday

Scene: The two-year-old and his stepdad were at their Irving, Texas apartment complex at the time

'You hear about stuff like this on the news all the time, but when it hits so close to home you just can't believe it's happening.'

A family friend shared a video to YouTube paying tribute to the little boy.

'He was so young, cute, and smart. He loved his mommy so much!' the friend, Katheline, wrote. 'May You Rest In Paradise Baby Nicho we love you so much.'
