Former TOWIE star Sam Faiers says she has overhauled her diet since her shock diagnosis of Crohn's disease earlier this year.

The 23-year-old's weight plummeted to just over 7st by the time she left the Celebrity Big Brother house in February.

Just five days into the show, she was hit by horrific stomach 
cramps within minutes of eating or drinking anything, which led to being 
sick or bouts of diarrhoea.

Healthier: Six months on from her Crohn's diagnosis, Sam says she's back in good health. She is now helping to raise awareness of the condition

'My body was just shutting down because there was just nothing inside me - I couldn't keep anything down, not even water,' she told MailOnline.

Two weeks after she left, she was given the devastating diagnosis that she had the chronic, incurable digestive condition.

'My
 family had tried to stay positive, and said it might just be a tummy 
bug, but I knew it was something more - you know your own body.

'Even when I was 
diagnosed, I didn't want to make a fuss. I just wanted to concentrate on
 getting back to normal. I'm
 quite strong - I'm not an "ill" person.'

Now, six months on, having got to grips with her diagnosis, she says she feels better than ever.

And the main reason? Adjusting her diet. 'I've learned that even after a couple of glasses of wine, I feel really rough the next day,' she told MailOnline. 'I don't know why - it might be because wine is so acidic.

'Now I'll just have a G&T - and I definitely drink less than I used to.'

Avoiding foods that are high in acid - such as wine and tomatoes - plus curries and fried foods, are key to preventing a flare-up, she says.

Undiagnosed: 'In the house my body was just shutting down because there was just nothing inside me - I couldn't keep anything down, not even water,' she told MailOnline

'I also can't eat popcorn - it really affects me, which is a shame as I used to really love it.'

High-fibre foods such as cereals are also off the menu.

Instead Sam, who now weighs just under 9st, follows a simple, healthy diet.

'Last summer I was single and on a lot of girlie holidays. This year, I've been more sensible, although I still love my food,' she says.

'I'm cutting out carbs where I can, but I need to keep my energy up, eating little and often.'

Breakfast, she says, is either porridge or poached eggs on granary bread, followed by a snack of fruit mid-morning.

Lunch will be a salad or a wrap with chicken or tuna, followed by a light dinner.

'I try not to have anything too big - and eat before 8pm.' says Sam. 'My trainer says it really helps to stay lean and toned.'

Sam has is now supporting this year's Gut Week, which runs from August 11-17.

The awareness week is part of Love Your Gut, an ongoing campaign which serves to 
highlight the vital role of the digestive system and emphasise the 
importance of maintaining good gut health.

Sam
 said: 'I'm really excited to be part of Love Your Gut. My Crohn’s 
disease has had a huge effect on my life and has shown me how vital 
looking after your health is.

'I want to continue raising awareness and help other people deal with their condition like me, with confidence.

Happy: Sam (pictured earlier this month) says she has just changed her diet, scrapping spicy, fatty foods and alcohol - and building up her strength through exercise

Proactive: Sam continues to be open about the disease to try and help others

'I hope by 
sharing my experiences I can show my support to digestive health 
sufferers across the UK.'

Sam now maintains her slim shape through regular workouts with her personal
 trainer. 'We don't do a lot of cardio - I don't want to shed weight,' 
she says.

'It's
 more about toning up and getting strong. I lost all my muscle when I 
was ill - so I am just trying to build myself up again. I do interval 
training, small weights, squats and lunges.'

Sam has also managed to cut her medication down to just one pill a day, which she will need to take for life.

So
 far, she hasn't had any more flare-ups. 'If I stick to what I am 
supposed to do, and try and avoid stress, then I hopefully won't have 
another one.

She still isn't sure what triggered the disease in the first place. 'It might have been stress - we just don't really know'.

What
 was clear was by the time she was diagnosed was that she was extremely ill. 
Test results showed she had so many ulcers in her gut that she'd been 
suffering the condition for about a year.

Despite the symptoms being there - such as needing the loo three or four times a day - she hadn't realised how ill she was.

Sam, who now weighs just under 9st, follows a simple, healthy diet

'I
 just put it down to rushing around, being hungover, having an upset 
tummy - that sort of thing,' she says. 'I didn't think to go to the 
doctor.

'Now I just want to raise 
awareness  - it's a really horrible, painful condition and I want to 
help other people get diagnosed and avoid flare-ups.

And she continues to be open about the disease to try and help others.

'After I went on This Morning and spoke about it, loads of people said to me they got tested for it and some were diagnosed.

'It's
 not the most glamorous thing to talk about but as long as I'm raising awareness and help others, then I'll keep doing it.'

Sam Faiers has teamed up with Love Your Gut to support this year’s Gut Week, which runs from August 11-17.

Gut Week is part of Love Your Gut, an ongoing campaign which serves to highlight the vital role of the digestive system and emphasise the importance of maintaining good gut health.

Sam said: ''Im really excited to be part of Love Your Gut. my Crohn’s disease has had a huge effect on my life and has shown me how vital looking after your health is.

'I want to continue raising awareness and help other people deal with their condition like me, with confidence.

'I’m proud that I can help and get involved with Gut Week. I hope that by sharing my experiences I can show my support to digestive health sufferers across the UK.'

The Love Your Gut campaign, now in it's 15th year, is co-ordinated by Yakult UK Limited in association with leading digestive health charities the IBS Network and Core.

Dr Nick Read, physician, psychotherapist and Medical Adviser to the IBS Network says: 'One of the biggest challenges we face is educating the public on looking after their gut by eating the right foods.

'Gut Week aims to bring those messages to people’s attention and get them thinking about their digestive health.'

Dr Tom Smith, Chief Executive at Core says: 'The Love Your Gut campaign strives to educate people on simple ways to keep your gut healthy.

'Small changes like getting more sleep, keeping regular meal times and trying to de-stress can make a huge improvement on your digestive health.'
