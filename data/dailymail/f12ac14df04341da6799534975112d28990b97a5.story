Nearly a quarter of young Australian men are now obese and the impact on their health is similar to premature ageing, new research has revealed.

A team at Deakin University's IMPACT Strategic Research Centre studied 2,500 men and women aged 20 to 96, using whole body scans to accurately assess fat and obesity levels.

They concluded that 24 per cent of young men in the 20 to 29 age group were obese - a significant rise on the previous estimate which was just eight per cent.

Researchers say that the huge discrepancy is due to problems with the Body Mass Index (BMI), which does not distinguish between different body shapes.

Crisis: Around 24 per cent of Australian men aged 20 to 29 are now overweight, new research has revealed

Professor Julie Pasco, deputy director of the IMPACT Strategic Research Centre and Head of the Epi-Centre for Healthy Ageing, said that the problem was particularly acute when assessing men.

'While we found BMI-based estimates for obesity in most women were fairly accurate, the use of the BMI markedly underestimated the amount of body fat in young men aged 20-29,' she said.

'The fat to weight ratio appears to be disproportionately high in this group, which means many young men are carrying more fat, proportional to their weight, than expected.

'Global and Australian estimates of obesity have been based on Body Mass Index. Yet, as a measure of body weight for height, this technique doesn't account for different body types.

'It doesn't distinguish between fat, muscle or bone, which contribute to body weight differently for men and women, and for different age groups.'

Professor Pasco blamed an active lifestyle and poor diet for the trend and added that the effect on the body left younger men prone to problems that usually come with age.

'It means that an alarming number of young men are exhibiting the physical characteristics of older men, where muscle mass has been replaced by fat,' she said.Â 

'This has particular implications for muscle weakness and potential osteoporosis later in life.'

The number of people who are obese worldwide has nearly doubled over the last 30 years, with women bearing the brunt of the trend.

Approximately one in three women and one in five men are obese - and an estimated two thirds of the adult population are either overweight or obese.

BMI has been the medical standard of measuring weight for many years. However, research over the last few years - including the latest study - indicates that it is not the most accurate of assessments.

'We knew that the BMI overestimates obesity in muscular body builds and underestimates obesity in the elderly, but the underestimation of obesity in young men is a new finding', Professor Pasco said.

'We have an obesity epidemic on our hands. We need the most accurate information possible so that we can address this issue and encourage people to improve their diet and lifestyle.'
