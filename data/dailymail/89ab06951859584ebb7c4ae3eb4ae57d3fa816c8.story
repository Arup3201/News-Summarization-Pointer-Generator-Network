Newsreader: Fiona Bruce, 48, said she dyes her hair a glossy brown because she wants to stave off any question of her being too old for television

You need a warm voice, an air of calm authority and a way with words to read the news.

According to Fiona Bruce, absolutely no hint of grey in your hair is also an advantage.

The 48-year-old BBC1 newsreader has explained that she dyes her hair a glossy brown because she wants to stave off any question of her being too old for television.

‘Age is definitely an issue for women in TV,’ she said. ‘So far, it hasn’t been for me, but I know I need to make the best of myself.

‘For instance, I have a few grey hairs. I dye them. I don’t let my grey hair show when I’m reading the news.’

As well as fronting BBC news programmes, Miss Bruce hosts Antiques Roadshow and arts programme Fake or Fortune?. Despite being one of the Corporation’s most recognisable faces, she appears far from certain about her long-term career.

‘I’m 48 years old and I feel very fortunate to be offered such amazing jobs,’ she told the October issue of Reader’s Digest.

‘I know it’s not always going to be like this. There comes a point - especially if you’re a woman - when your career just falls off a cliff.

‘I’m not being self-pitying. That’s just the way it is.’

Miss Bruce has already contemplated life after the BBC, saying she dreams of travelling, enjoying more time with her family or even becoming a magistrate one day.

She is married to advertising executive Nigel Sharrocks, and they have two children Sam, 14, and Mia, ten.

Asked how she would approach her life 
post-TV she replied: ‘I’m sure there’ll be a period of adjustment. For a
 start, I won’t be looking as glam as I do today.

‘I’ll
 be slobbing around in a pair of old jeans and a T-shirt, hair all over 
the place. “Blimey, that Fiona Bruce has let herself go a bit!”

‘Seriously, though, there are a million and one things I’d love to get stuck into.

‘Travel, finally get to spend some time with the family. And I’d love to become a magistrate.

‘Then again, maybe I’ll just take off on my horse.

‘Yeah, that’s where you’ll find me. Trekking across the Andes.’

Despite her concern for her appearance, Miss Bruce said she would never have cosmetic surgery.

‘My husband would never forgive me,’ she said.

‘When the person you love feels that way, it’s a bit of a non-starter.’

It’s not the first time she has spoken of the pressures on women in TV. In 2009 she declared they had to devote more time to their appearance than male colleagues.

‘You can’t look like the back end of a bus, and you do have to scrub up quite well,’ she said at the time.

‘But do you have to be a beauty? No. Do you have to pay more attention to your appearance than the blokes do? Yes. Twas ever thus, and I can’t see it changing in my lifetime.’
