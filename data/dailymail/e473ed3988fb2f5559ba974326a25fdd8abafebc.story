Tweet: Mrs Bercow, the Speaker's wife, has always denied that her Tweet was defamatory

A tweet sent by Sally Bercow pointed the ‘finger of blame’ at a Tory peer, suggesting he was a sex offender, the High Court heard yesterday.

The Speaker’s wife arrived at court in a revealing flowery dress and bright red shoes to hear lawyers argue over her message and whether it was defamatory.

A Newsnight investigation aired  on November 2 last year accused a politician of allegedly abusing boys at a Welsh care home – but did not give a name.

Two days later, the Speaker’s wife tweeted: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’, in an apparent reference to a rumour he was the man involved.

The former Conservative Party treasurer denied all the allegations and the alleged victim later retracted his account of life at Bryn Estyn care home in the 70s and 80s.

Lord McAlpine threatened legal proceedings against those who he claimed had defamed him. He has already received six-figure payouts from the BBC and ITV.

Bercow would not comment on the case, but denies libel and claims her tweet did not defame the peer as it was posed as an innocent question.

Leading libel judge Mr Justice Tugendhat presided over the argument about the ‘natural and ordinary meaning’ and ‘innuendo’ of the tweet.

Sir Edward Garnier QC, representing Lord McAlpine, said: ‘The tweet, by itself, suggests that “Lord McAlpine” has done something wrong . . . The inclusion of the words “innocent face” was giving a nudge and a wink to readers.’

He added: ‘What was the tweet about, if it was not pointing the finger of blame at Lord McAlpine?’

William McCormick QC, for Bercow, said it was ‘an entirely neutral statement’ and not ‘objectionable’.

She was in the High Court today as a judge decides on the meaning of her allegedly libellous tweet about the furore.

Sir Edward Garnier QC said it would be difficult to think of a more serious meaning than the one advanced by Lord McAlpine, who was not in court.

He told Mr Justice Tugendhat that his case was founded on the circumstances in which Mrs Bercow decided to tweet the peer's name - the media frenzy over a story that spread 'like wildfire'.

It was also necessary to consider the words themselves, in isolation.

'The tweet, by itself, suggests that "Lord McAlpine" has done something wrong. Drawing attention to someone and then adding the expression "innocent face" hints at wrongdoing and negates any suggestion that the tweet was a neutral query to which the defendant was looking for an answer.

'The inclusion of the words "innocent face" was giving a nudge and a wink to readers.'

He said a user of Twitter was not someone who ignored what was happening in the world - he or she, far from being a hermit or shut off from the media, was inquisitive and IT literate.

'In short, there was a prominent and salacious story in the media, and what was missing was the name of the abuser at its centre.'

Sir Edward said that, against the backdrop of almost saturation news coverage, Mrs Bercow  tweeted Lord McAlpine's name - a man who fitted the description of the unnamed person at the centre of the controversy.

The addition of 'innocent face' underpinned the connection of him to wrongdoing and the hypothetical reasonable reader would have put two and two together and understood the connection to the abuse allegations, he added.

'Put another way, what was the tweet about, if it was not pointing the finger of blame at Lord McAlpine?'

Dispute: Mrs Bercow has always denied that her Tweet about Lord McAlpine was defamatory

Interpretation: The Tweet at the centre of the High Court libel battle

Mrs Bercow's counsel, William McCormick QC, has told the judge that she promptly tweeted her apologies, provided letters apologising for the distress caused and making clear that the underlying allegations were untrue, and made an offer to settle the case which had not been withdrawn.

He said that the tweet posed a question and contained an implied statement of fact that Lord McAlpine was trending, but this was entirely neutral and no more objectionable than the statement to precisely the same effect on the Twitter homepage.

The words and punctuation of 'innocent face' were merely an indication that the question should be read with a deadpan emphasis or tone, comparable with stage directions such as sotto voce or a notation on a musical score.

Dispute: Lord McAlpine is suing Mrs Bercow for defamation in the High Court over the Tweet which he says wrongly implicated him in child abuse. She denies this

Lord McAlpine's distress at the tweet was entirely comprehensible on a human level, he added.

Mrs Bercow drew attention to the fact that he was trending but if readers of the Tweet were prompted by the question she posed to find tweets which defamed the peer, that was not a matter which should lead to damages against her.

It was not accepted that the background events to the claim were notorious general knowledge.

Lord McAlpine's career, distinguished as it was, ended 20 years ago and the Newsnight broadcast, while of real interest to some, did not attract a particularly large audience.

The evidence of publicity given to the allegations fell far short of proving that on the day of the tweet - November 4 2012 - the fact of the Newsnight allegations, let alone the description of the individual concerned, was general knowledge.

The extent and nature of the coverage changed markedly the day after the tweet following an interview with the Prime Minister on ITV and then again after the retraction of the original allegation by Newsnight's source.

'Whereas later coverage might fairly be described as "blanket" and such as to make the events "notorious" or general knowledge, this was not so at the time of the tweet.'

He said that, even if the tweet was to be taken as referring to some form of controversy surrounding Lord McAlpine, it was a form of reportage, making no attempt to take a side in that controversy, but merely noting that it existed.

The hearing is only concerned with the actual meaning of the words complained of - both a natural and ordinary meaning and an innuendo meaning.

If the judge rules in Lord McAlpine's favour, there will be a hearing at a later date on the appropriate level of damages unless the two sides agree a settlement.

The judge reserved his decision to a later unspecified date.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
