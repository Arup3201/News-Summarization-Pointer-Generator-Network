At least two passengers are dead and a third is missing after a small airplane crashed on Friday afternoon in New York state.

The plane, a Piper PA 34, was being used by the Angel Flight organization, a non-profit that sets up free air transportation for children and adults who need to travel to receive medical treatment.

Investigators have found the bodies of the flight's two passengers, but are still searching for the pilot.

The plane was headed for Rome, N.Y. and the crash occurred about 60 miles east of its intended destination

‘The bulk of the plane is in the water, in a pond, completely submerged and we have to wait until daylight to put divers in,’ Fulton County Sheriff Thomas Lorey told uticaod.com.

None of the people on-board have been identified yet.

The airplane took off from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Mass., and crashed shortly after 5 p.m., Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said.

The flight was headed for Rome, N.Y. and the crash occurred about 60 miles east of the intended destination.

Larry Camerlin, president and founder of Angel Flight Northeast, said the organization was ‘tremendously saddened’ by the news.

‘We all offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of those affected,’ he said.

‘Our volunteer pilots are the most compassionate and generous individuals who donate their time, aircraft and fuel to transport patients and loved ones for free to essential medical care that would otherwise not be readily available to them.

'There are no words that can adequately express our sorrow.’

A witness who saw the crash told uticad.com she heard a loud explosion and when she went outside there were pieces of airplane coming out of the sky.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, including what the weather conditions were like at the time of the accident.

Camerlin's statement said that since Angel Flight NE was founded in 1996, the group has set up free air transportation and medical care for more than 65,000 children and adults on about 60,000 flights covering a total of more than 12 million miles.
