This must literally be the largest political cover up in China's history - a very dirty trick that's dragged one council's reputation right through the mud.

Local officials in Sihong county in east China's Jiangsu province could not be bothered to wait for planning permission to build more than 20 new motorways ... so they built them anyway and covered them with earth to stop their paymasters spotting them by satellite.

Central Government officials have clamped down hard on illegal building in the country using satellite imaging to spot unauthorized developments.

But with the planning permission notoriously slow - many companies and even local government officials have been going ahead with projects anyway - hoping that the planning permission will follow by the time the building work is finished.

Corruption uncovered! The officials could not be bothered to wait for planning permission for a prestigious new motorway and more than 20 highways, so they built them anyway in the country's eastern Jiangsu province

What under Earth? Central Government officials have clamped down hard on illegal building in the country using satellite imaging to spot unauthorized developments. but that didn't stop these officials

So when they got fed up with delays in applying for permission to build a motorway and 20 other much needed roads, they went and built them anyway - but then covered them with mud so that nobody would know - and even planted soya beans on top.

The move meant that the illegal road did not show up on the National Land and Resources Bureau's remote sensing satellite - and the plan was to expose the road once the planning permission was granted.

That, of course, meant that the road would appear to have been built almost overnight.

Don't spill the beans! Incredibly, they even planted soya beans on top of the roads to make them look more authentic

Come to satellite: The move meant that the illegal road did 
not show up on the National Land and Resources Bureau's remote sensing 
satellite - and the plan was to expose the road once the planning 
permission was granted

But they were caught anyway when local farmers who were not compensated reported them to central government.

Villager Lin Feng said: 'The workers turned up in May 2010 and just dug up our crops and built a road that they needed to sign a contract for to get an industrial park.

'The road took a year to build and then they covered it with earth - but they never compensated us.'

Miracle roads: That, of course, meant that the road would appear to have been built almost overnight

Up in farms: But they were caught anyway when local farmers who were not compensated reported them to central government

This is not the first time the stunt has been tried, as it was also used in Shuanggou town near Xiangyang city in Hubei province, in Central China when another road project was also covered with mud.

But again they were caught by local informers. According to Miao Feng, the deputy director of Xiangzhou district of Xiangyang city, tax cuts meant many local councils had been under pressure to attract investment for example by building industrial estates.

The road was needed to move ahead with the construction of the Shuanggou industrial park, mainly processing food. The local government was given a hefty fine for the illegal appropriation of the farmland.
