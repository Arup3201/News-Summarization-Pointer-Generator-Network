The bodies of two people killed when a massive boulder fell on their house in Utah on Thursday afternoon have been recovered.

Jeff Elsey, 58, and Maureen Morris, 65, were retrieved from the wreckage Friday.

The
house in Rockville was completely demolished by the rock, which 
crushed the entire wooden structure of the building, leaving behind a 
scene of complete devastation.

Rockville Mayor Dan McGuire 
identified the couple, who died Thursday after a rock-slide destroyed 
their home while they were inside it. Rescue crews discovered the bodies 
Thursday night but recovery was called off due to 
freezing conditions and the unstable structure.

'Really, it's 
just a state of total unbelief and shock,' Rockville Mayor Dan McGuire 
told the Deseret News, describing the town's residents as 'numb.'

The couple had lived in the small town of Rockville for about six years and were well-known in the community.

'It's
been tough to see the people show up and crumble into tears. It's been 
hard for the whole canyon,' Springdale Police Chief Kurt Wright told the
Deseret News.

Jeff Elsey worked at the Cable Mountain Lodge in Springdale.

'Our
thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by the tragic loss we 
have all suffered in Rockville tonight. All of us at the Lodge were 
blessed to share many great moments with these two wonderful, kind 
people,' reads a post left on the lodge's page.

Morris' Facebook 
page, filled with pictures of the couple's new grandson and pictures of 
her beloved home, states that she had worked at Kawasaki Motors Corp 
since 1980 and was originally from Orange, California.

The 
two-story home belonging to Morris and Elsey sat at the bottom of a 
mountain. Thursday's rock slide sent several enormous boulders 
barreling down the mountain - including the one that landed on the 
house, which McGuire says was larger than a semitrailer.

Fixtures in town: The couple, originally from Calfornia, had lived in Rockville for six years and had recently welcomed a baby grandson

Impact: The house, which stood alone in front of a cliff face was crushed by the giant boulder after it was dislodged by the landslide

Line of fire: The log cabin was vulnerable to falling debris due to its location at the bottom of the rocky surface

Response: Emergency services reacted to the rockslide, but soon had to retreat due to unsafe conditions overhead

He told the Deseret News that the couple, like everyone in the town, was aware of the dangers of rock slides.

'It's
just one of those things everybody always talks about but never 
imagines will ever happen, have two people killed,' he said.

'Through
conversation with other people, [Elsey and Morris] actually said, "If 
the rocks want to take me, let it happen." So that was the attitude they
had, that most people have,' the mayor said. 'We live in a dangerous 
area. On one side of the highway is the river, and we get floods. And on
the other side is the mountain.'

When
emergency services arrived at the scene, shortly after 5pm Thursday, 
they found the splintered remains of the home buried under the weight of
the gigantic boulder which stood at a height of around 15 feet.

The town is located on the main highway through Zion National Park, NBC station KSL in Salt Lake City reported.

Mayor McGuire, told local press that the earth close to the road 
gave way causing a landslide which carried tons of soil and rocks on to 
the home at the bottom of a steep incline.

He added that the cause of the fall is being treated as natural with no human activity being blamed for triggering the slide.

McGuire said the house 'just flattened out' when the debris hit, confirming that nobody in the house has survived.

As it was: The two storey house had concrete foundations with a wooden upper tier which was smashed by the boulder

Devastation: Two people were inside the house which was at the bottom of a steep incline close to one of the area's major highways

Recovery: Emergency crews began working at the scene but were forced to call off their search due to the risk of further falling debris

Disaster scene: A family car can be seen parked outside the home in Rockville Utah. A similar incident crushed a home in 2002 but there were no fatalities

Emergency crews responded to the slide but their work was hampered by the dangerous conditions overhead.

Officers told the Deseret News the rock slide likely started after frost and ice around it began to thaw.

Several other homes in the area have been evacuated after geologists found they were at risk of another rock slide.

A similar incident in 2002 saw another home destroyed but no one was harmed.
