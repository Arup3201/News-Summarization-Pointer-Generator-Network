Sir Philip Green comments: 'We have been looking at this category as fashion inspired fitness develops, and know that this is right in our customers' heartland.

'Creating a partnership with Beyoncé, one of the most hard-working and talented people in the world, who spends many hours of her life dancing, rehearsing and training is a unique opportunity to develop this category.'

'I could not think of a better partner as I continue to grow the Parkwood business. I have always loved TopShop for their fashion credentials and forward thinking' said Beyoncé.

'Working with their development team to create and produce a technical and fashion led collection is exciting and I'm looking forward to participating in all aspects of this partnership.' 

Beyonce is undoubtedly a style icon for her generation and her legions of fans will be desperate to get their hands on her latest fashion venture when it launches next Autumn 

Beyonce teamed up with H&M in 2013 as the face of their Summer campaign 

Together with her mother Tina, Beyonce launched her own fashion brand House of Dereon in 2005

Named after Beyonce's maternal grandmother Agnèz Deréon the brand includes denim collections as well as sportswear, footwear and high glamour clothes

Sir Philip adds: 'Being partners with Beyoncé and her team who have the greatest creative energy and enthusiasm is inspiring for all of the team at Topshop. We have much to achieve in just under a year but we are all up for the challenge, and look forward to delivering athletic street-wear in an inventive and exciting way.'

And the Arcadia tycoon, whose company operates Topshop, insists the venture isn't just another celebrity collaboration.

He told WWD: 'This not a collaboration. This is about building a brand and building a business - a separate, proper business, with separate overhead and a separate office.

Kate Moss has done two collections with TopShop. The one last year was festival inspired 

Beyonce is of course following in the footsteps of the incredibly successful collaborations between both Kate Moss and Topshop, the launch of which caused a frenzy at the Oxford Street store 

'When she was in London in February we arranged to get together. We started talking generally, about doing something together. We've been looking at that [athletic] sector for a while. It's something we need to be in. 

'Based on what she does, how she works out, the conversation got into that category. We started getting into proper conversation in May or June, as to how it would work. It took six or eight weeks to put a deal together. 

'On Friday, Beyoncé came to our office for the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle.'

The retail giant confirmed he will hire a separate team to run the new label, including a creative director and designers.

He added: 'We've been brainstorming about the name. We haven't got there yet.'

Beyonce is of course following in the footsteps of the incredibly successful collaborations between both Kate Moss and Christopher Kane and Topshop. 

This latest venture is by no means the 33-year-old songstress's first foray into the world of fashion.

As well as a collaboration in 2013 with H&M, which saw her become the face of the brand and the collection heavily influenced by her personal style, she also runs her own fashion label House of Dereon.
