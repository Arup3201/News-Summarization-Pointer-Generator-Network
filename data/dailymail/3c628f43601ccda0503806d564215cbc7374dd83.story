A solicitor is looking to complement her life in the law arena and start a glamorous career as a Kate Middleton lookalike.

With her long brown hair and graceful smile, Christina Spencer, 26, says people believe she looks like the Duchess of Cambridge.

Their resemblance was pointed out to the lawyer, from Brighton, East Sussex, when she was 21.

She is now hunting for a Prince William lookalike to complete the act so she can start her new career.

The comparisons escalated in the build up to the royal wedding in April 2011.

She said: 'It will be people that I don’t know at all who tell me I look like her.

'Quite often it will be an icebreaker and the first thing that someone ever says to me.'

And of course, Ms Spencer is taking the comparison as a compliment.

She said: 'You can’t really have much more of a compliment then saying you look like the Duchess of Cambridge.

'If you’re going to look like somebody then she’s the person I would most like to look like.'

Ms Spencer believes her polite manner, which she developed during her job as a solicitor, has helped with the image.

She is now practising the facial expressions and mannerisms of the Duchess, while looking for a professional partner to enhance her act.

She added: 'I’m looking for a William lookalike but they’re really hard to find.

But one part of her voice is causing her problems.

She said: 'Unfortunately I’ve got a lisp, which she doesn’t have.

'I might have to work on that, but it could be funny to have a lisping Kate.'
