A shopper was just picking up a few essentials from her local Target last week when she happened upon a heartwarming scene between an employee and a young man. 

Dennis Roberts, an employee at the store in Raleigh, North Carolina, was seen helping a young man tie a tie so he could look professional for a job interview at a nearby Chick-Fil-A fast-food restaurant.

The photo was posted online and now the young man who was caught in the picture, Yasir Moore, has been identified and since returned to the store to thank the staff for their extraordinary customer service.

'It's a good story. Usually in the world today you don't see a lot of good things that happen.'

Yasir's mother is equally grateful to the strangers who showed her son kindness.

'They could have just sold my son a tie,' said Najirah Parrish. 'But they took the time, helped him tie the tie and talked to him. They treated my son with dignity, respect.'

They also gave him real world advice to help him get a job.

'I did step-by-step what he told me,' Yasir said.

Life coach! The folks at Target say they do this kind of thing every day. It's just that this time someone got a picture of it

Customer service! Store employee Dennis Roberts (pictured) also gave the young man a few interview tips before he left the store

Scene: Above, the Raleigh, North Carolina Super Target where the kind act happened last Wednesday

Mr Roberts' coworker Cathy Scott was the first to greet the customer on Wednesday when he came in looking for a clip-on tie for his interview. 

Since the store was out of the clip-on ties, she directed him to the regular ties but he didn't know how to tie it. 

After checking out, Ms Scott brought the boy back to her co-worker Mr Roberts. 

'Cathy says, 'Can you tie a tie?' I said, 'Yes,'' Mr Roberts told WTVD. 'We took the wrapping off it, and I tied it on my neck, and fit it over head adjusted it and tightened it...fixed all his collar buttons and he was set to go.' 

Good job: Both Mr Roberts and the Target chain are receiving praise for helping the boy out

Mr Roberts then went on to help the young man prepare for his job interview by asking him the typical questions a hiring manager would ask.

'We said, 'Make sure you look him in the eye.' I'm saying make sure you give him a firm handshake, and she showed him... he tucked his shirt in,' said Mr Roberts. 

It was when he was giving the young man advice that Ms Mark snapped her now-viral photo. 

 'It was a very quiet simple moment, but it was very profound honestly kindness... from strangers... in a Super Target,' Ms Mark, a mother of three, said. 

'He leaves and all these Target employees are screaming 'Bye! Good luck! Tell us how it went.''

The young man left the store as the Mr Roberts and the other employees wished him good luck and asked him to come back and tell them how it went. 

'We were just here to help a young man get a job and forward his future,' Mr Roberts said. 

'When he told me all this advice, I got my confidence back,' said Yasir. 'And so when I went for my interview I was calm, cool, and collected.' 

'You usually see friends or family help you do that kind of stuff, not just strangers you've never met before,' he said.

As for the job, Yasir was called back for a second interview on Saturday although there is still one final stage before it is known whether he got the job.

Yasir said his parents are buying him another new tie for his next interview.

Uplifting: 'They could have just sold my son a tie,' said Moore's mother, Najirah Parrish. 'But they took the time, helped him tie the tie and talked to him. They treated my son with dignity and respect'
