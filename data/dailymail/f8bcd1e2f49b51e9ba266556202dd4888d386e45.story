Botox fan: Forever youthful singer Kylie Minogue

It may be a favourite among stars such as Kylie Minogue, but Botox jabs do not make you better looking, according to new research.

A study, published in the Journal Of Clinical And Aesthetic Dermatology, is the first to look at whether injectable cosmetic procedures – chosen by thousands of Britons each year – make women appear healthier, younger and more attractive.

When shown pictures of ten women who had had Botox, 150 volunteers said they now looked marginally less attractive than before.

However, fillers – gels injected under the skin to add volume – were found to improve appearance.

Botox works by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that tells muscles to contract.

Over time, the nerves rebuild the ability to release the chemical messenger, allowing muscles to regain their function.

This usually takes  several months.

The research was carried out  by London-based cosmetic surgeon Dr Michael Prager. 

He did not administer the injections himself, so was able to remain impartial.

He says: ‘We’re all aware  of people with frozen faces from too many treatments. Muscle movement  around the eye area is incredibly important for expressive empathy.

‘In most of the women in the study, the eyebrow level was lower after Botox and the under-eye area was saggier.

'They may have been free  from crow’s feet but they didn’t look as good. You won’t always see an instant boost to attractiveness from Botox.’

Dr Prager adds: ‘Facial muscles are interconnected. If you freeze one part, you could relax another and cause sagging in that area.

'Botox can change the volume distribution of the face and injecting it into the eye area can make the cheeks droopier.’

As we age, we lose volume in our upper face and gain it in the lower  face, creating a jowly effect.

Dr Prager has noticed that a prime concern for many patients is achieving a jaw line  to rival Hollywood stars such as Angelina Jolie.

‘I still think that Botox is great but it has to be used in much smaller doses around the eye and forehead and in much larger amounts in the lower face and neck,’ Dr Prager says.

‘Botox is much better if it is used for shaping the face rather than as a treatment for lines and wrinkles.’
