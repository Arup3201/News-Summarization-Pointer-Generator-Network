Real Madrid's historic La Decima triumph in the Champions League last season netted them a whopping £46m, according to the official UEFA breakdown.

The Spanish giants beat city rivals Atletico 4-1 in a memorable Lisbon final to win their first European Cup since 2002 and their tenth overall.

And they consequently pocketed the biggest share of UEFA's £726m prize fund for the 32 clubs that qualified for the group stage.

Beaten finalists Atletico earned £40.1m for their efforts, putting them third on the Champions League money list.

Paris Saint-Germain split the Madrid sides despite bowing out in the quarter-finals, getting £43.7m thanks mainly to lucrative French TV rights.

However, UEFA is withholding £16m as a fine for overspending in breach of their Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations.

Bonus: Beaten finalists Atletico collected £40.1m for their exploits in reaching a first European Cup final for 40 years

Losing out: Paris Saint-Germain earned £43.7m from last season's competition, but will lose £16m for breaching UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations

Manchester United, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Barcelona all earned at least £32m despite failing to make the final.

United, who lost to Bayern in the last eight, made just shy of £36m, more than neighbours City (£28.4m).

Chelsea, who crashed out to Atletico in the semi-finals, were rewarded with £34.85m, while London rivals Arsenal took home £21.87m.

It shows that despite United's failings last season, they can still command the biggest slice of TV money.

Belgian side Anderlecht's £9.7m payment was the lowest.

Financial boost: Manchester United earned the most of the English teams - just under £36m - despite losing the Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals

The figures include payments to certain clubs (marked *) that are being withheld due to non-compliance with Financial Fair Play regulations.
