Curled up together in an adorable pose, all these cuddly leopard cubs want to do is snuggle with their teddy bear. 

The clouded leopard cubs were born at Houston Zoo in Texas earlier this year, but these are the first pictures released of the pair.

They were born in June but since then, have received 24-hour care by the zoological team in the veterinary clinic.

The cubs are the first ever clouded leopards at Houston Zoo and are the offspring of Suksn and Tarak, both aged two, the year they begin their reproduction. 

Clouded leopards -  the most talented climbers among the cats - are classified as 'vulnerable' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) and its total population is no more than 10,000. 

This is down to factors such as deforestation, illegal trading, and poaching commercially. Some parts, such as claws, skin, and teeth are also consumed for decoration purposes.
