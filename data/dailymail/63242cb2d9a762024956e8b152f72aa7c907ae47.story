Boxing legend Muhammad Ali was reunited with NFL great Jim Brown on Saturday, almost 50 years after the pair were involved in a heated debate over the former's decision to not fight in the Vietnam War.

The pair were in attendance at Ali's annual Humanitarian Awards service where Brown received a lifetime humanitarian achievement award. 

The line-up of Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Award winners included Academy Award-winning actress Susan Sarandon and Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Common. Other award winners included a half-dozen young adults from around the world honoured for their humanitarian roles.

In 1967 Ali was under increasing pressure for refusing induction into the Army with Brown on his side only after wanting to hear the the boxing champion's reasons for not answering the call to military service.

Brown led a group of prominent black athletes who hit Ali with a flurry of questions during a two-hour meeting in Cleveland in June that year. 

Known as the the "Ali Summit", the boxer didn't duck the questions and stuck to his principles, citing his religious beliefs in refusing to join the military.

The dozen athletes, including NBA greats Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, emerged from the meeting to publicly support Ali at a time when the champ was one of the country's most polarising figures.

'People got the answers that they wanted,' Brown recalled Saturday.

Ali was stripped of his world heavyweight boxing title in 1967 while in his prime and was convicted of draft evasion. Ali found himself embroiled in a legal fight that ended in 1971, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favour.

Ali regained the heavyweight title in 1974, defeating George Foreman in the "Rumble in the Jungle." A year later, he outlasted Joe Frazier in the epic "Thrilla in Manila" bout. His last title came in 1978 when he defeated Leon Spinks.

Long before Ali became an icon, the meeting's participants were taking a risk by throwing their support behind him.

'It was the United States government that we were dealing with,' Brown added. 

'Careers were at stake and everybody that showed up at that meeting put all of that on the line. That was heavyweight stuff.'
