The criminal mastermind behind a notorious armed robbery in which a policewoman was killed dynamited himself out of a high-security prison today.

Redoine Faid, one of the most feared armed robbers in France, broke out of Sequedin jail, near Lille.

The 40-year-old is armed and dangerous, and police have issued an all ports alert which includes the Channels one from which Faid could reach Britain.

Redoine Faid used explosives to blast through five prison doors and break free in the northern town of Sequedin

Faid took four prison wardens hostage early on Saturday morning and then blew up five heavy doors.

Police believe that his wife may have smuggled explosives wrapped in handkerchiefs into the prison.

Once
 outside, Faid released the guards and was driven away at high speed in a
 car which was later found burned out near the town of Ronchin.

Detectives were trying to trace a second vehicle which Faid is thought to have jumped in to.

'It
 all happened very quickly,' sad a prison spokesman. 'The escape was 
clearly very well organised - we are still busy trying to work out the 
facts.'

Faid was 
named as the chief suspect for the organising of a botched armed robbery
 in 2010 in which Aurelie Fouquet, a 26-year-old policeman was killed.

Some 27 people were arrested in a sting operation following the murder, but Faid escaped.

He was finally arrested in June 2011 and sent to prison for eight years.

He is also notorious for his brazen attacks on cash-in-transit vehicles.

Etiene Dobremetz, a prison warden union official at Sequedin, said the four men taken hostage had all been 'deeply traumatised'.

It was Mr Dobremetz who accused Faid's
 wife of supplying the explosives, but the criminal's lawyer, Jean-Louis
 Pelletier, denied this, saying she had not even visited the prison 
today.

Mr Dobremetz said he
 was 'not at all surprised' that his client had escaped, adding: 'That a
 prisoner should escape is, in principal, not particularly surprising.

'Especially when the prisoner is 
someone in his situation, and, if I may say so, someone with his social 
network. There was certainly the possibility that this could happen.'

Faid, who grew up on a council estate outside Paris, is notorious for attacking armoured vehicles carrying cash.

In
 1998 he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for at least eight armed 
robberies and bank thefts, but in 2009 he was released on parole.
