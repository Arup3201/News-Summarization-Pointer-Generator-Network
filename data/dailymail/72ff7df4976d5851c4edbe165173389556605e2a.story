Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell's grandmother has revealed that she took the little girl to the police after learning Mama June's boyfriend had sexually abused her, saying: 'I wanted to kill him.'

In an exclusive interview with Entertainment Tonight, Sandra Hale said she believes that her daughter, June Shannon, has rekindled her romance with Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years behind bars for child molestation.

Anna was just eight when she told a teacher that Mark McDaniel had repeatedly assaulted her.

'My reaction was I wanted to kill him,' Hale said. 'To do that to a child - especially her... I took her to the police department and filed the charges. I wasn't going to let this go away.'

Anger: Sandra Hale, the mother of Mama June, had custody of Anna when she was reportedly sexually assaulted by Mark McDaniel, June's boyfriend, in 2002. She has spoken out about her anger at the case

Anna, who is now 20, has previously said that Mama June told her she didn't believe her accusations, and Hale said she thinks she is still refusing to accept them.

'She was in denial and I feel she's still in denial,' she said.

It also appears that she's in denial about seeing McDaniel again; despite images showing them together, she has claimed that she has not spoken to him.

But Hale says she doesn't believe her - and says that she is now concerned for the safety of Honey Boo Boo who, at aged nine, is a year older than Anna was when she was abused.

'That's about the same age he likes,' she said.

Hale said that when child protective services called her this week, she urged them to look 'carefully and closely' into the allegations that McDaniel has been hanging around Mama June's children.  

Hale's interview came as Anna also spoke to Entertainment Tonight about claims that her mother is dating the man she claims attacked her.

'I'm mad. I'm upset. I feel betrayed. I feel very hurt,' she said. 'That's the main thing that I am - I feel very hurt that Mama let him come around.

Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, has spoken out about her anger in an interview with Entertainment Tonight after her mother was pictured with the man who Anna says molested her when she was eight

Hurt: She said that she would spit in Mark McDaniel's face if she saw him again and would tell him to leave

'She's smiling and giggling when he's around. You know, he's a child molester, Mama. He did this to me. Why would you let him come around the girls knowing what he did?'  

She said she cannot believe her mother would bring the convicted molester in contact with her younger children, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, nine, and Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14.

'You should have told him to leave!' Anna said of her mother. 'If that was me and I was there I would tell him, 'You did this to yourself, and you're not supposed to be around kids. Either you leave or I'll call the cops and your a** will go back to jail'.' 

She added that she could not understand why her mother is letting him around the girls - as photographs have suggested - especially because she could lose custody of them if a child services investigation finds anything untoward

'She let him get around Alana and Pumpkin knowing that she is going to get the kids taken away,' she cried. 'Why? Why let him? 

'It's Mama's fault. It's her fault. She has to live with it. She has brung the past back and now she can't get the past away now.'

When host Nischelle Turner asked her to send a message to McDaniel, she lost her composure and broke down into sobs.

'I would look at him in disgust,' she said. 'I would either spit in his face and say 'Either you f***ing leave or I will call the cops because you're not supposed to be here because you know what you did'.'

Accused: An image shows Mark McDaniel, 53, who served 10 years in prison for child molestation

Cardwell, who is now married with a two-year-old daughter, said that she just goes 'day by day' in the aftermath of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of McDaniel eight years ago.

She added that she encourages her nine-year-old sister Alana not to get too close 'because you never know what will happen'.  

Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel, 53, despite damning photographs that show them house hunting toegther and him hanging out with Alana.

After the images emerged, TLC canceled the show, which has had four seasons.   

Anna claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was forced to watch.

'I wanted to kill him,' Hale said of finding out about Anna's accusations.

On Friday, RadarOnline reported that after Mama June signed the TV deal in 2012, she begged Anna - who was then pregnant - to return home.

'June bribed Anna with money to move in with the family,' a source said. 'She offered her $500 a month because she believed Anna's unmarried teenage pregnancy would create good story lines.'

McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He was released from prison in March.

Cardwell married her husband Michael almost six months ago and they have since moved from Georgia to Alabama with Anna's daughter Kaitlyn for Michael's new truck mechanic job.

Earlier this week, Michael, 22, paid tribute to his wife in a touching Facebook post.

'I have to say I probably have the strongest wife in the world,' he wrote. 'Even [through] all this BS and betrayal she has [kept] her head high and not let this get her down. Baby I love you so much.'
