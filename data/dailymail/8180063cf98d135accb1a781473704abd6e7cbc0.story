Leeds United may no longer play in the Barclays Premier League but they still attract their fair share of celebrities to Elland Road.

Hollywood A-lister Verne Troyer, best known as the actor who played Mini-Me in the Austin Powers films, was pictured with Massimo Cellino's daughter, Eleonora Cellino, at the ground on Saturday.

Troyer wore a Leeds shirt as he saw the Championship club beat top-of-the-table Derby County 2-0.

But it isn't the first time Troyer, who starred in the 1999 and 2002 Austin Powers movies with Mike Myers, has shown his support for a football team in England.

In 2011 he was pictured wearing an Arsenal shirt while with Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo.
