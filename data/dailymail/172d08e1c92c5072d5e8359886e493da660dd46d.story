Could this be the weekend Chelsea wrapped up the Premier League title - despite losing for the first time this season at Newcastle?

As Chelsea's 3,000-plus travelling fans were making their way back south, wallowing in the unfamiliar sensation of defeat, phones would have lit up and hearts would have been lifted by the news coming in from Manchester.

For at the Etihad Stadium, Sergio Aguero was hobbling from the field in tears. The deadly Argentine striker, who has scored an incredible 19 goals in 20 matches this season, was clearly in agony - you could tell simply from the grimace on his face.

Manchester City beat Everton 1-0 to cut the gap to just three points after Chelsea lost at Newcastle

Slowly, the news emerged that every Manchester City fan had feared. Suspected knee ligament damage, MRI scans this week, the possibility of their talisman on the sidelines for weeks, maybe months.

So on the day City trimmed Chelsea's lead at the Premier League summit to just three points, finally breathing new life into the title race, a potential disaster.

As Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville tweeted: 'If Aguero's injury is a bad one then this could be the weekend Chelsea won the league!'

While we won't know for certain about the extent of Aguero's injury until the middle of the week - though he will certainly miss their make-or-break Champions League trip to Roma - we do know that City have been adversely affected before by his absence.

In all, Aguero has scored 19 goals in 20 matches so far this season, including a hat-trick against Bayern

Since the striker arrived from Atletico Madrid in 2011, he has played in 102 Premier League matches and missed a total of 27 either through injury or selection.

City's win percentage dips from 69.6 per cent to 63 per cent when Aguero is not in the side.

In his second campaign at City, Aguero missed two league matches with a knee problem in March. One of them saw a 2-0 defeat at Everton that pretty much ended any hopes of catching Man United in the title race.

Last season, he was out injured for City's trip to Aston Villa in late September and they lost 3-2. And his lengthy absence with hamstring and knee problems late in the campaign included a 1-0 home loss to Chelsea.

His absence didn't affect City in the title race - they ultimately secured the title - but his hamstring troubles did contribute to their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona.

6 - Yaya Toure

5 - Frank Lampard

4 - Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic

2 - David Silva

But there have also been spells when Aguero has been out injured and City have not really missed him. For example, he had a calf injury about this time last season and City still won all five league matches in his absence. 

The reality is that Aguero has become an even more talismanic figure this season. It is not just his remarkable goalscoring run that has pretty much kept City in contention both at home and in Europe, but the astonishing work rate and creativity that sets up goals for others.

If the worst fears are realised and Aguero is ruled out for the pivotal and congested Christmas and New Year fixture list, the burden will fall heavily on City's other stars. Most have not yet reached the heights of last year.

Their first test will come in the cauldron of the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night as City try to prolong their European campaign beyond Christmas.

But if Aguero is sidelined for a while, City's next challenge is to find a way of compensating for the lost goals he would have provided.

The goalscoring burden now falls on Edin Dzeko, who has four so far this season

Stevan Jovetic has also contributed four goals so far this campaign but will now get more game time

Aguero has 19 in all competitions this season. The next highest is the six scored by Yaya Toure. Of the other strikers at Manuel Pellegrini's disposal, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic have just four apiece.

With City's main source of goals cut off, Chelsea could easily have re-established their commanding lead at the top by Christmas.

City fans will be awaiting news of Aguero's hospital scans, praying this injury isn't as bad as it first appeared.
