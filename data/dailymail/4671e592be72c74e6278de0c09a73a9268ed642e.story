A 7ft criminal who escaped a jail sentence because he is too tall for prison beds has appeared in court for breaching his curfew.

Jude Medcalf, 23, spent 75 days on remand earlier this year for stealing food and Christmas presents from an NHS office and firing a BB gun at a woman.

But a judge at Exeter Crown Court ordered his release in March because he suffers from Klinefelter Syndrome, a growth disorder meaning he’s too big for standard prison beds and uniforms.

Jude Medcalf, 23, who was released from jail earlier this year because he was too tall for the beds, has been back in court accused of breaching his curfew

Medcalf was instead given a 12-month community order and six-month curfew after he pleaded guilty to possession of an imitation firearm and a bladed article, criminal damage and burglary.

But Medcalf - who is nicknamed Tiny - was back in court today after breaching his curfew.

Medcalf, whose condition and means he is still growing and is only capable of adolescent emotions, was supposed to be at home between midnight to 6am every night.

However the court heard Medcalf worked at a fairground and his bosses sometimes asked him to stay late without warning.

His lawyer said he only breached his curfew because he was so desperate to keep his job.

Judge Graham Cottle decided to lift the curfew six weeks early so Medcalf of Newton Abbot, Devon, could carry on working.

The judge said: 'A curfew is designed to address a case where people are out committing crimes in the evening and it seems like Mr Medcalf isn’t. 

'I’m going to remove this curfew as it is not serving it’s purpose.'

Medcalf was arrested after he terrified an innocent woman by firing a BB gun at her, and then went on to steal £30 of Christmas presents and £20 tea money from an NHS office.

He was later found with stolen food - including a large amount of rump steak, which was taken from The Sloop pub in Newton Abbot while it was open and staff were distracted.

Sufferers of Klinefelter Syndrome,  often develop enlarged breasts, have sparse facial and body hair, small testes, and an inability to produce sperm.

Men with the condition often grow to 6ft or 6ft 2in, but only of two men - including Medcalf - have grown to 7ft. 

Sufferers also tend to have gender issues because they have an extra 'X', or female, chromosome, and may also suffer skeletal problems.
