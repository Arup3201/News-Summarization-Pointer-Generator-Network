When life was just beginning to emerge  on Earth, nearby Mars could also have been a watery world shrouded in a dense atmosphere that could have supported life.

One of the reasons water no longer flows on Mars's surface is because its atmosphere is less than 1% of the density of the Earth's.

But Professor Josef Dufek, of Georgia Tech university, looked at a crater left by a rock fragment around 3.5 billion years ago, found by Mars Rover Spirit - and realised from the depth of the crater that the atmosphere must once have been much thicker.

It adds to a growing body of evidence that water once flowed on Mars.

He began his studies with a rock fragment propelled into the Martian atmosphere during a volcanic eruption roughly 3.5 billion years ago, reports journal Geophysical Research Letters.

The Mars rover Spirit landed at the site in 2007 and took a close look at the remaining fragment, enabling prof Dufek and colleagues to calculate the size, depth and shape of the divot.

The team then created craters of their own for comparison, firing particles into grains the same size as those found by Spirit.

They calculated that the speed the particles must have been moving to recreate the divot would have required an atmospheric pressure 20 times greater than that found today.

This suggests Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, said prof Dufek.

He said: ‘Atmospheric pressure has likely played a role in developing almost all Mars' surface features.

‘The planet's climate, the physical state of water on its surface and the potential for life are all influenced by atmospheric conditions.

‘Our study is consistent with growing research that early Mars was at least a transiently watery world with a much denser atmosphere than we see today.

The Tiu Vallis region on the surface is dotted with buttes, valleys and craters thought to have been carved out by energetic masses of liquid in the distant past

‘We were only able to study one bomb sag at one location on the Red Planet. We hope to do future tests on other samples based on observations by the next rover, Curiosity.’

An earlier study found gypsum on Mars - indicating there was once water on Mars and the possibility of life.

ournal Science reports that the gypsum could only have been formed in water below 60 c and writes: ‘That means that conditions conducive to life once existed on the edge of the crater.’

One of reasons water doesn't flow on Mars is  atmosphere is 1% as thick as Earth's
