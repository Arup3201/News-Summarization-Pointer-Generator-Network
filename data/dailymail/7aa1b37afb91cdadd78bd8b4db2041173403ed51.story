Hero: Jessica Cowley has hailed her guide dog Jet a hero a hero after he pushed her son Jacob's pram out of the path of an out of control car

A guide dog saved the life of a baby after running free of its owner and pushing a pram out of the way of an out of control car.

Black labrador Jet saw the car careering toward the family and pulled away from her owner Jessica Cowley's grip.

The dog managed to push a pram containing Mrs Cowley's son Jacob out of the path of the car and away to safety.

Mrs Cowley said: 'I had felt Jess pull away from me - I had to let go of her harness as she was so strong.'

The family had been walking across the entrance to a car park close to their home in Leigh, Lancashire, when the incident happened.

The car is believed to have been shunted by another vehicle and forced off the road towards Mrs Cowley - who is registered blind and has tunnel vision - and her one-year-old son.

Although the pram fell on its side Jacob only suffered a cut lip following the road accident.

The incident happened close to a veterinary surgery and staff there came out to help Mrs Cowley, Jacob and Jet.

Vet Caroline Purnell took Jet to see her owner immediately after the accident.

Mrs Cowley said: 'She was worried about me but once she had licked my face and checked I was conscious she was fine.'

Ms Purnell added: 'Mrs Cowley was face down on the floor with her left leg trapped on one side of a bollard.

'We really feel that she demonstrated exactly how important these dogs are. She showed no concern for her own safety and went to protect her handlerâ€™s child before helping her handler.'

Mrs Cowley said Jet had been given extra treats and cuddles since the accident.

'She loves Jacob and thinks of him as her own. What she did was extremely brave and I am very proud of her,' she said.

Mrs Cowley was taken to Salford Royal Hospital suffering from severe bruising but is now recovering at home.
