With the MET office predicting that Britain will face the 'coldest winter in 20 years', you could be forgiven for wanting to get away.

But while most of us have to tough it out at home worrying about the heating bills, it's a different story for those with the cash to escape the UK's wintry weather.

Sales of beachwear are twice what they 
were this time last year at exclusive department store Selfridges with items such as kaftans, bikinis and 
sundresses among the most popular.

Luxury luggage sales have also increased 
by 91 per cent compared to this time last year, as shoppers prepare to 
head for warmer climes.

According to the London store vintage style luggage brand Steamline is proving particularly popular, with sales of the Entrepreneur range more than 
doubling and making the brand one of the best sellers online.

Selfridges has attributed the spike in sales to 'Twixtmas' - the period between Christmas and New Year, that's the most popular time to jet off for a winter break and escape the Big Freeze.

'We always see an increase in sales at Christmas but news of the cold spell hitting the UK over Christmas is sending everyone packing,' says Helen Attwood, Selfridges Travel and Lingerie Buying Manager.

Although temperatures are expected to warm up over the weekend, record numbers have placed bets on the UK enjoying a white Christmas with bookmakers, Ladbrokes.

But not everyone's happy about the freezing weather, with travellers heading to sunnier spots left stranded after flights were cancelled and trains delayed.

Despite the cold weather calamities, shoppers have been content to brave the cold and have been flocking to Selfridges in increasing numbers.

The department store launched its new swimwear department in September, introducing the new SS13 summer collection and the arrival of 16 new international swimwear and accessories brands, including Matthew Williamson, Etro and Pucci.
