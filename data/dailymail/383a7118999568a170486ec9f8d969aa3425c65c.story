Nanny Yoselyn Ortega, 52, pictured in court in 2013, accused of killing two young children in their New York apartment, has apologized for what she did 

A nanny accused of killing two children in the bathtub of their New York home said she was sorry for what she had done but maintains she is angry at how the parents treated her.

Yoselyn Ortega has pleaded not guilty to butchering six-year-old Lucia Krim and two-year-old Leo Krim at their Upper West Side apartment in October 2012.

Their mother Marina, 38, was out picking up her third child, Nessie, from a swimming lesson when she returned to find her children's bodies. 

Ortega, 52, then cut her throat while sitting next to them in a failed suicide bid.

The court papers say the Dominican immigrant told authorities the little girl tried to fight back before she stabbed her and then killed the boy. 

She used at least two knives.

'Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done,' she said, according to the court papers. 

'Relieve me of my misery.'

The documents were included as exhibits in lengthy motions filed by defense attorney Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg. 

She asked that the prosecutor be dropped from the case and that the judge bar news media from an upcoming court hearing.

Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro denied both requests.

Van Leer-Greenberg has said Ortega cannot understand the case because of her injuries and because she suffers from delusions. But a judge found her fit for trial.

Ortega's statements had not previously been made public. They included details from interviews with authorities after she regained consciousness. 

She told authorities she hurt the children because she was having money problems and was angry at the parents. 

She said her schedule constantly shifted, she had to act as a cleaning lady though she didn't want to and she missed an appointment with 'the psych,' according to the papers.

'I had to do everything and take care of the kids,' she said. 'God forgive me, so many things they made me do. Pray for me.'

In the moments before the killings, the children were out getting ice cream and going to a park because Lulu, as Lucia was called, didn't want to go to dance class, according to the court papers.

The parents, Kevin and Marina Krim, have not spoken publicly about the killings. Last year, at a fundraiser for their nonprofit, they said they missed their children every day and will forever.

'We are just heartbroken,' Kevin Krim said. 'But they inspire us every day as well. Their lives give us a purpose.'

Last year it was reported that when Ortega was shown the horrifying photos of the dead children, she asked: 'Oh, my God, who did that to them?' 

In interviews she has previously denied having anything to do with the case.
