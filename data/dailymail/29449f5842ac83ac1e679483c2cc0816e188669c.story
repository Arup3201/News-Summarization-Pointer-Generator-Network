It's been 16 years since Charlotte disappeared into the bedroom with her 'rabbit' vibrator on Sex and the City.

Now more women in the UK own a vibrator than a washing machine.

Sex toys have been a part of many women's lives for well over a decade - now it looks like men are about to muscle their way into the market.

Tracey says that the male population are really starting to embrace the idea of sex toys especially using them with their partner

There's been a tenfold increase in the sale of male sex toys in the UK in the last decade.

It's predicted to be the fastest growing sector of the industry in 2014, with a market worth Â£10 million in the UK alone.

But we're not talking blow-up dolls here - in fact, the average man's motivation to buy a sex toy is far from sleazy or selfish.

Easy access to informative sex education, a long overdue discussion of erection problems and a generation of women eager to explain the intricacies of their baffling sexual systems has finally had the desired effect.

Men have grown up about sex, moved past the all-roads-lead-to-intercourse formula and (finally!) acknowledged the basic design flaw of the male/female sexual response system - that the clitoris is outside the vagina.

The biggest selling male sex toy is the 'love ring' - a ring that fits around the base of the penis, holding the blood in the three spongy chambers that fill to make him erect.

How is this a step in the right direction when it's still penis-centric?

Tracey has launched a new range of male sex toys called Edge designed to improve male stamina in bed

A lot of the love rings have a little vibrator attached to them - and that's designed to bring her pleasure and attempt to even up the orgasm quota (currently running at about 4:1 in his favour).

'Strokers' - textured squidgy sleeves that slide over the penis and are then moved up and down by hand to intensify the sensation - are the second biggest selling sex toy for him.

But far from being used solo, they're being used with partners as a exploratory couple's toy (75 per cent of buyers are in a relationship).

Penis pumps, which create a vacuum to improve blood flow to the penis, ensuring healthy, firm erections, are another big seller.

Men, traditionally dreadful at looking after their health, are realising that unless they want to be part of the current post-40 Viagra-popping generation, it pays to keep that part of their anatomy in good working order.

Tracey says that men's interest in sex toys could also help improve sex with their partner

There was a reason why women wholeheartedly embraced sex toys, in particular vibrators - we need them.

The vibrator is the most reliable route to orgasm for women; only 25 percent of women consistently orgasm during intercourse and about 20 per cent seldom or ever do.

The humble vibrator is, without a doubt, the single most revolutionary device ever invented in terms of female sexuality.

Without it, a large chunk of women would never experience an orgasm at all, let alone be able to teach their partner how to do it. (At least if you've had one, you have a clue what you're aiming for.)

The surge of interest from men in sex toys is also a positive move forward because they're going for products designed to improve sex with their partner in a quest to keep sex interesting for both.

Today's man wants to perform well and be well informed about sex, rather than cling onto sex myths that aren't based in reality and aren't serving either gender well.

As most of you know who read my column regularly, I've been designing sex products for couples for years.

I've always wanted to design a range for men because I've always felt men miss out when it comes to sex toys - the focus has been on women because vibrators are such big business.

But I wasn't convinced men were quite ready and willing to invite devices that might just do the job better than they could, into the bedroom.

Now they are.

Let's hope the male sex toy phenomena is equally as influential on our sex lives as the female version.

My new range Edge, is the world's first mainstream range of sex toys for men and is designed to improve men's performance in bed. Click here to find out more.
