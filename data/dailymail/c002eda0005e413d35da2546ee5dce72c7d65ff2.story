Ralph Lauren has revealed it is testing smart shirts that can monitor their wearer's health at the US Open.

The shirts will be worn by ball boys to monitor their vital signs through the day.

The firm says it plans to put the tech into its sports and dress shirts next year.

Marcos Giron, the No. 1 singles player in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, is playing in his first Grand Slam in Flushing, and will wear the Polo Tech shirt during his practices.

The shirts contain a conductive silver-coated thread that is woven discreetly into the fiber

Using this thread, the system can monitor your heart rate, breathing and stress levels.

A bluetooth module on the shirt sends the data to a smartphone app. 

David Brewer, US Open Tournament Director, said there are features in the Polo Tech shirt that can 'revolutionize how players train and compete.'

'The fact that Ralph Lauren chose the US Open as the venue to unveil its Polo Tech shirt enhances our tradition as a showcase for innovation,' said Brewer.

The shirt has sensors knitted into the core of the product to read biological and physiological information.

'Ralph Lauren continues to be at the cutting edge of fashion and culture,' said David Lauren, Senior Vice President of Advertising, Marketing and Public Relations, and the son of the designer.

'Our goal is to create and reflect the ultimate lifestyle, and we believe that a healthy and active life is an essential part of that. 

'Ralph Lauren is excited to help lead the industry in wearable technology in this ever-evolving, modern world.'

Beyond elite athletes, however, David Lauren also sees a place for the Polo Tech shirt in everyday life.

'Our vision is that this will transcend sports to help us at every age and in every aspect of lif,' the firm said.

'Reaching far beyond just the needs of elite athletes, Polo Tech will offer innovative technology for all ages and lifestyles to promote general wellness and quality of life.'

As the official outfitter of the two-week U.S. Tennis Association tournament, Ralph Lauren is dressing several ball boys in the Polo Tech Shirt during select matches at the Billie Jean National Tennis Center. 

Marcos Giron, the No. 1 singles player in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, is playing in his first Grand Slam in Flushing, and he will wear the Polo Tech shirt during his practices. 

He will track his biometrics and making adjustments in real time to his play, form and breathing.

The shirt was developed with tech firm OM.

'It was clear from our very first meeting that Ralph Lauren had clarity of mind about the future of fashion tech,' said Stéphane Marceau, CEO of OMsignal. 

'Its legendary Polo brand and unparalleled design and merchandising capabilities make Ralph Lauren a natural partner to bring smart clothing technology into everyday lives.'

The shirt has sensors knitted into the core of the product to read biological and physiological information.

With OMsignal, the data collected by the shirt is stored by a 'black box,' which includes an accelerometer and gyroscope, which capture movement and direction. 

That 'black box' transmits the data into the cloud, where it is plugged into a number of algorithms that gauge important performance-oriented biometrics, including heartbeat and respiration, as well as some psychometrics, such as stress level and energy output.
