A Wisconsin lawmaker plans to hand out Klu Klux Klan hoods at a Republican convention in his state this weekend in protest of what he believes are 'racist policies.'

Democratic gubernatorial candidate and Wisconsin state representative Brett Hulsey tweeted a picture on Thursday night of the homemade white, cloth hats he plans to hand out.

Hulsey said on twitter the hats were meant to bring attention to issues like racial profiling, which he says Republican Governor Scott Walker and the Republican Party of Wisconsin support.

Hulsey described the hoods as Republican Party hats.

Republican National Committee spokesman 
Raffi Willaims denounced Hulsey's plan to MailOnline, saying 'the KKK and the hood symbolize pure hate
 and terrorism for Blacks across the country.'

'The KKK is not 
and should never be used as a political prop or punchline doing so makes
 light of the struggle so many went through,' said Willaims, who is 
black.

Williams called on national Democratic Party leaders to denounce Hulsey's behavior, as well.

State party leaders have already come out against the representative.

'We take serious issue with the policies pursued by Republicans that 
disproportionately affect communities of color, but this type of 
behavior has no place in the public dialogue,' Democratic Party Chairman
 Mike Tate told the Wisconsin State Journal, the outlet that brought attention to Hulsey's plans.

'What is inappropriate is @GovWalker #WIGOP attacks on the poor, women, working families,' Hulsey said on twitter in response to the party distancing itself from him.

'Holy
 cow, Hulsey. Dial it back to an 8 or a 9. This is like an 11 on the 
crazy scale', Rebuen Glaser, social media manager for a Democrat running
 against Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan
 in November's election, tweeted at Hulsey.

In a press release promoting his protest 
sent after his political stunt attracted negative attention, Hulsey did 
not mention his hats. He did say confederate re-enactors would meet him 
outside the GOP event, and the press release asked supporters to, 'Please bring tasteful signs, no profanity please.'

'Governor [Scott] Walker and the Wisconsin Republicans should own up to their 
anti-minority, anti-woman, and anti-child record as they vote to leave 
the Union on Saturday,' Hulsey said in the press release.

'I have lived and worked in the 
South and would rather they leave Wisconsin than continue to take us 
backward into Wississippi,' he continued.

At its convention tomorrow, the GOP will vote on a resolution that would
 allow the state secede. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that party 
officials do not expect the measure to pass.

Hulsey is running in the Democratic primary for Governor. If he were to win the primary, he would face Walker in the general election in November.

'If elected governor, I will end Scott Walkerâ€™s racist Reign of Error 
and reverse these bad choices in the state budget,' Hulsey said in Friday's press release.
