Inspirational cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton received a massive boost last night after his charity fund neared £3million – almost three times his target of £1million.

The news came as the terminally ill 19-year-old revealed he felt ‘fantastic’ and was breathing unaided after a surprise improvement in his condition.

Stephen, who originally wanted to raise £10,000 before revising his target to £1million, touched the hearts of millions last Tuesday after writing a final Facebook blog thanking followers and donors to his chosen charity, the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Last night TV comedian Jason Manford paid the latest of many celebrity tributes by bringing forward his May 10 gig - and it sold out in four minutes.

A stars' hero: Stephen Sutton with Roger Daltry, one of the many celebrities to support his cause

Stephen Sutton, 19, has raised more than £2million since posting this 'thumbs up' from his hospital bed

Stephen said he was too ill to carry on after doctors told him he could stop breathing after a lung collapsed.

The heartbreaking message was accompanied by a picture of him in his hospital bed giving his trademark thumbs-up.

The
 poignant last post caused cash to flood in after a host of celebrities 
helped to publicise his fundraising efforts in a social media campaign 
called Thumbs Up For Stephen, started by Jason Manford.

A host of others joined in including Who frontman Roger Daltrey and actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Simon Pegg and Stephen Fry.

Jason Manford brought forward his May 10 gig at Birmingham Player's Bar in a bid to boost the figure

Support: It is the comedian's latest show of support for the campaign, which has raised millions

Plea: Manford has urged the public to push the fundraising total to more than £5million

Manford
 also brought in fellow comics Alan Davies, Russell Brand and Bill 
Bailey as well as Olympian Sir Chris Hoy and chef Raymond Blanc.

At
 the time, Stephen had raised £570,000, but the money began pouring in 
at up to £400,000 a day.

On Friday, Manford announced he would perform his May 10 gig at Birmingham Player's Bar on Sunday to boost the steadily-increasing figure.

By the end of the gig, the total stood at £2,883,691.38 and
 still rising.

Stephen, of 
Burntwood, Staffordshire, was diagnosed at 15 with colorectal cancer, 
but after having the tumour removed it returned and spread to his lungs,
 groin and knee.

His 
parents, Andrew and Jane, 49, and stepfather Tony Gallagher, 53, have 
been with him at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital since he went in 
on Easter Sunday.

The 
teenager had set himself a bucket list of 46 achievements to complete 
before he died, including making a bungee jump, skydiving and watching a
 football match at Wembley.

But
 with ten things left, he decided to fundraise instead. The total on his
 Just Giving webpage has already broken previous records at the online 
donation site.

Yesterday, his older brother Chris said the surge of support may have bought Stephen more time with his family.

The
 21-year-old said they thought Stephen was close to death last week and 
described his improvement as ‘incredible’, adding: ‘The support has 
certainly had an effect.

Stephen said last night: 'The tumours in my body are still rife, but I feel so lucky to just still be here'

‘We are not out of the woods but we have been amazed by his constant improvement.’

After
 warning that he faced the ‘final hurdle’ on Tuesday, Stephen had 
improved sufficiently by Thursday to update his Facebook followers, 
saying: ‘Genuinely thought I was a goner.... hey, I’m still here!!’

Yesterday, he said he had made another improvement – after coughing up a tumour.

He
 described it on Facebook as the most ‘bizarre but fortunate twist’, 
adding: ‘I am relying on NO external oxygen to breathe at all and I’m 
feeling bl**** fantastic!! The doctors have discussed what’s happened 
and the only plausible conclusion is that I’ve literally coughed up a 
tumour.’

He said the growth
 had restricted his collapsed lung, adding: ‘A tumour breaking away like
 this is possible, but it all just seems incredibly surreal – mind, I’m 
not complaining!’
