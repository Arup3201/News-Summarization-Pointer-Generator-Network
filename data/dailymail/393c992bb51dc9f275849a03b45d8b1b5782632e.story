Tony Blair’s government, including ministers, advisers and even civil servants, became obsessed with trying to prevent the Labour Prime Minister from being ousted from power, leaked emails reveal.

Number 10 aides became embroiled in a desperate and at times highly emotional scramble to shore up the Blair premiership in August 2006, as pressure mounted for him to set a date to leave.

Ben Wegg-Prosser, former director of strategic communications, released the cache of emails as a warning to Ed Miliband of the dangers of in-fighting distracting from running the country.

Battle: Tony Blair's aides, spin doctors and officials became embroiled in a frantic battle to prevent Gordon Brown ousting him from Number 10 during the summer of 2006

The emails reveal how allies of Mr Blair were also desperate to prevent him from endorsing Gordon Brown as his successor when he finally quit in 2007.

But in the summer of 2006, the Blair and Brown camps became embroiled in an all-consuming battle for power.

It includes a scramble to get dozens of Labour MPs to sign a letter urging Mr Blair to stay in Downing Street.

And Mr Blair's chief of staff suggesting their 'people' starting accusing Mr Brown of 'blackmail'.

The emails from inside the Blair bunker reveal the desperation of No.10 aides to see off calls for the PM to go in September 2006.

Here is a selection, as reported in The Guardian:

Tuesday 5 September 2006

11.10am from head of policy Matthew Taylor: Can we continue to try to get MPs to ring each other? We won't be able to pretend this is spontaneous but we want it to be seen we are co-ordinating an MPs effort rather than driving it from here.

11.36am from assistant press secretary Razi Rahman:At 11.30am we have 17 names.

11.35am from Wegg-Prosser: [Karen] Buck is next port of call we need her up and about very quickly. Her phone [is] switched off and we are chasing her.

If Buck does not come through in an hour we will need to identify another candidate to lead on this. Lunchtime news confused, but tone not good.

2.29pm from Rahman: Currently we have 34 names doc attacked

5.31pm from Rahman: 5.30pm update 54 MPs signed up. List attached.

5.35pm from political secretary John McTernan: add Mary Creagh and Jim Sheridan.

5.36pm from Wegg-Prosser: Sheridan IS ON THEIR LETTER

5.38pm from McTernan: I know a real unravelling, Anne Moffat [then MP for East Lothian] in Scotland persuaded Jim.

5.39pm from Rahman: now 57 MPs

Wednesday 6 September 2006

2.19pm from Blair chief of staff Jonathan Powell: TB thinks we need to plan a roll out of cabinet members in support around his statement. Can we co-ordinate this? And we need to get people to start using the expression blackmail as in we cannot have the party to give into the blackmail of a small number of MPs threatening continued instability while calling for stability.Friday 8 September 2006

1.29pm from Jonathan Pearse in the whips' office: Whips office have been doing a lot of ringing round today. Some concern amongst colleagues that CC [Charles Clarke] was put up by us so the message is anything we can do to stop now would be helpful to calming the situation down. Bob Ainsworth [MP] says it is also important that Alan Milburn and Stephen Byers don't say anything to stoke the fires as we will get the blame for that.

1.37pm from Wegg-Prosser: Umm this thing has ruined my weekend which admittedly was ruined some time ago thanks to half a dozen unknown student politicians who by accident became Labour MPs.

6.15pm from Wegg-Prosser to former Blair aide Anji Hunter: I am shattered. I did my best - taking orders from our friend in Brussels and my own instincts. Key points impossible to have proper negotiations cos every time they agreed something they leaked it to the papers.

GB kept demanding TB's endorsement yet at the same time told that he had to leave office immediately cos the public hate him – weird or what. There was no shouting that was made up. First meeting in GB office the second on the patio.

Releasing the emails, Mr Wegg-Prosser 
warned: ‘The sheer emotional energy these scrapes consumed does not 
reflect well on any of the participants – me included.

‘Everyone who participated in them, 
from ministers, MPs, advisers and many more civil servants than is ever 
acknowledged, should reflect on what else could have been achieved when 
we weren't fighting.’

Just 15 months after winning a third 
successive general election, Mr Blair came under mounting pressure to 
announce when he would make way for Mr Brown.

But the messages detail how Mr Blair's closest allies team tried to avoid setting a date for his departure.

The emails cover August 21, 2006 to 
September 8, 2006, and show how figures from Number 10 and Labour 
attempt to deal with increasing pressure for clarity on Mr Blair's 
future.

Mr Wegg-Prosser released the emails to The Guardian to coincide with the Daily Mail’s publication of the explosive memoirs of former Brown spin doctor Damien McBride.

Mr McBride was the former press secretary of Mr Brown and is referred to as ‘Damian McP****face" by Mr Wegg-Prosser in the emails released.

The emails reveal the frantic and often despairing attempts to find Labour MPs who would publicly back Mr Blair, and the tussles to draft statements and briefings for the media.

Then-foreign secretary David Miliband and then-home secretary John Reid were muted as possible challengers to Mr Brown for the leadership.

At one point  Liz Lloyd, then-deputy chief of staff at Number 10, on September 6 was asked about getting Mr Miliband to put his name forward. She replies: ‘I still cannot get up the courage to tell him his country needs him.’

Writing for the Guardian, Mr Wegg-Prosser said the manner of Mr Blair's departure still ‘casts a shadow’ over Labour.

He said: ‘The “coup” of September 2006 was the culmination of 12 years of mutual frustration between the occupants of numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street. The constant ding-dongs served neither man well.

‘Looking back, the response from Team Blair to the letter-writing campaign to remove him from office was remarkably naive, coordinated through random email chains, conference calls and impromptu meetings.

‘It is now clear that Team Brown were effectively running a disciplined war-room with battle plans and an agreed sequence of attack. That it should have come to this is profoundly depressing.

‘It was also clear that Brown's team were convinced that the answer to every problem which Labour faced was that Blair should go. We, on the other hand, toyed with the idea of boosting other potential challengers to Brown. Curiously, whenever the issue was raised with the prime minister he was reluctant to engage.’

Mr Wegg-Prosser conceded: ‘The sheer emotional energy these scrapes consumed does not reflect well on any of the participants - me included.

‘Everyone who participated in them, from ministers, MPs, advisers and many more civil servants than is ever acknowledged, should reflect on what else could have been achieved if we weren't fighting."

Mr McBride has tweeted a response to the messages, referencing characters from US crime drama The Wire.

He wrote: ‘I love the No.10 emails: I feel like (Jimmy) McNulty going through (Russell) Stringer Bell's apartment.’

Mr McBride added on his Twitter account: ‘I suppose the virtue of publishing old emails and diaries is it doesn't require any self-criticism from those whose egos prevent that.’
