Kidnap: A two-year-old boy, only identified as Logan, was snatched from a hotel room three days ago

A two-year-old French boy kidnapped in Bali three days ago has been safely recovered this morning.

The missing child, identified only as Logan, was kidnapped at night from a Bali hotel where he was staying with his father.

Details of the kidnapping were suppressed for 24 hours as it was being reported that an alleged mistake by the child's father might have led to his son being taken away.

According to an unconfirmed report, the boy's father went out for the evening and brought a European woman back to his hotel room in the famous Kuta Beach region.

When he awoke the woman had left and his son was missing.

According to a member of staff at The Three Brothers Bungalows in Legian, the father was staying there when the boy was snatched three nights ago.

People who have commented on the mystery case have questioned where the boy's mother was at the time.

Authorities fear that two kidnappings in
Indonesia in the same week could lead to the spread of similar crimes 
in the country.

Malcolm Primrose, 61, who works for an oil company, was 
kidnapped in the Aceh region on Tuesday when his car was ambushed but he was returned safely this morning.

This particular case has echoes of British girl Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in the Portuguese resort of Praia Da Luz in 2007 from her family's holiday apartment.Â 

Safe return: Logan and his father were reunited at the Three Brothers Inn in Bali this morning

The report, which the authorities have yet to confirm, has panicked several people planning a holiday in Bali.

Joanne Robertson wrote on Facebook the the news was 'just terrible.'

She added: 'I am heading to Bali in August with my young children. We are staying in Legian. It has me worried. I hope they find the little boy.'
