A Uruguayan TV station has launched an attack on the English press for criticising Luis Suarez by 'reminding Englishmen' that Geoff Hurst’s goal in the 1966 World Cup final did not cross the line.

Broadcaster Tenfield claims Suarez bumped into Chiellini with his 'face', and says it was only after English journalists brought up the issue of a bite that FIFA decided to investigate.

In an article posted on their website, the station advises Englishmen criticising Suarez to remember that Geoff Hurst's extra-time goal in the 1966 final against West Germany did not cross the line.

A Uruguayan TV station has defended Luis Suarez saying that Englishmen criticising the striker should remember that Geoff Hurt's goal in the 1966 World Cup didn't cross the line

Suarez is facing a ban of up to two years after apparently biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini (pictured)

The article goes on to say that the footage of Suarez biting Chiellini's shoulder is not conclusive, claiming that he stumbles before making contact, which may indicate he tripped.

They say the fact that Suarez came away holding his teeth means that contact was not intentional, adding that Suarez thought his mouth was about to start bleeding.

Suarez has also defended himself today, 
saying: 'These are things that happen on the pitch, we were both in the 
area, he thrust his shoulder into me.

'These things happen on the pitch, 
and we don't have to give them so much (importance).'

However FIFA disagree and have today charged Suarez over the biting incident with Chiellini, which could see him banned from football for up to two years if found guilty.

The Uruguayan forward is accused of sinking his jaws into the shoulder of the Italian defender in Brazil, just 14 months after he was given a  doing the same thing in Britain.

Fifa’s 
disciplinary committee said this morning that it had opened proceedings 
against Liverpool player Suárez, and has asked his team to present 
evidence by 5pm local time (9pm BST) today.

In Uruguay, the press have not mentioned the alleged bite incident, instead focusing on the team's win which took them through to the last 16 knockout stage.

Suarez
 and Chiellini have a fraught history, with the striker appearing to try
 and bite Chiellini in a previous clash between Uruguay and Italy at 
last year's Confederations Cup.

On that occasion the defender rounded on Suarez, squaring up to him before pushing him away.

The two sides met during the third-place play-off during the World Cup warm-up tournament and on that occasion Italy won on penalties after finishing 2-2 at the end of extra time.

England beat West Germany 4-2 in the 1966 final in Wembley Stadium. Hurst's injury-time goal to take England to 3-2 rebounded off the crossbar before landing on the goal line.

After the referee ruled to allow it, Germany were forced into an all-out attack before Hurst scored another goal just as the match ended.
