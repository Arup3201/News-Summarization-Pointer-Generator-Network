A 23-year-old mother of two from New Mexico was found slain in a local park Sunday as her young son was wandering nearby. 

Investigators are looking at surveillance video and conducting interviews, but they have yet to identify any suspects in the killing of Ariel Ulibarri, of Clovis. 

The woman's 6-year-old son was found unharmed in the parking lot, and what he told investigators has them considering the case as a homicide.

Police found the woman's body at around 7.30am Sunday after people heard screams at the Goodwin Lake Trails Walking Park.

Police Capt. Patrick Whitney said investigators do not know at this time whether Miss Ulibarri was targeted by somebody she knew, or whether she was a victim of a random attack.

Police withheld specifics on how she was killed, but according to a press release posted online, what the responding officers came upon was a grisly crime scene. 

'The death of the woman is considered a homicide at this time due to the amount of blood,' police stated.  

The attack on the young mother is believed to have taken place six minutes before police received the first 911 call about a possible homicide in the park.

The little boy ran into a passerby and led him to the site of his mother's slaying 

Sgt. Daron Roach said that one of the callers was an elderly man who told the emergency dispatcher that he had run into the victim's son in the parking lot.   

'Then the boy led him to where his mother had been brutally murdered,' Roach told the station Connect Amarillo.

Police are now waiting for the results of an autopsy on Miss Ulibarri's body by the state Office of the Medical Investigator, which said Tuesday that the final report likely won't be available for several weeks.

Mystery: Police are looking at social media sites and Ulibarri's text messages, but for now they have no suspects

Investigators are in the process of checking social media sites, cell phone records and text messages related to Ariel Ulibarri. They are also talking to people who had had relationships with the 23-year-old. 

Meanwhile, Sgt. Roach said police patrol the park but have had few if any calls about trouble in the 40-acre park, which opened in 2011, the Clovis News Journal reported.

Parks Director Mark Dayhoff said the area around the trail gets little maintenance because it's intended to be a nature trail.
