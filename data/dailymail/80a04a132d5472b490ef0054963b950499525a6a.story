Nigel Farage today defended a disgraced Ukip candidate taped mocking ‘poofters’, referring to a Chinese woman as a ‘Chinky bird’ and threatening to ‘shoot peasants’.

The Ukip leader said he felt sorry for ‘loutish’ Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments, which were not considered offensive in TV shows like Only Fools and Horses.

Mr Farage hit back at claims it was not further proof that Ukip is racist and homophobic, claiming people who live in London are ‘snobbish’ about ‘colloquial language’ which is common amongst people who live in council houses.

Ukip leader said he felt sorry for ‘loutish’ Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments

Mr Farage said Mr Smith (right) was not suitable to be a Ukip candidate, but was only speaking like people outside 'snobbish' London

Ukip has had a torrid few weeks, dogged by in-fighting over candidate selection and gaffes by Mr Farage which have seen his personal ratings plummet to a record low.

The party’s general secretary Roger Bird was suspended over allegations of behaving inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, including taking her for dinner and buying her a dress. She had been a front runner for the seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock, but after pulling out of the race, Mr Smith was selected.

But days later, tape-recorded phone calls made by Mr Smith emerged in which he:

Mr Farage initially refused to sack Mr Smith, with Ukip insiders hoping an apology would help the row to ‘blow over’. But he stood down on Monday ‘by mutual consent’.

However, today Mr Farage leapt to Mr Smith’s defence, insisting that there was nothing ‘evil’ about his comments.

The Ukip leader told LBC radio: ‘I’m a bit sad because Kerry Smith is a rough diamond, a council house boy from the east end of London, left school early, and talks and speaks in a way that a lot of people from that background do.

‘If you and your mates are going out for a Chinese what do you say you are going for?’

When host Nick Ferrari insisted he would not use the word ‘Chinky’, Mr Farage insisted: ‘A lot of people would… I don’t think I’ve ever used that word. 

‘The point is this: I feel a bit sorry for Kerry Smith, I think even the poofter comment – the next sentence he was saying how good the candidate was and the fact he was gay would be an asset to the party.

‘I think he has had a tough time. However, he is not suitable to be a parliamentary candidate.

‘I think we are very snobbish in London about condemning people perhaps for the colloquial language they use particularly if it’s not meant with really unpleasant intent.’

Nigel Farage today insisted he was only joking when he blamed immigrants for a traffic jam on the M4.

The Ukip leader was mocked this month for the bizarre excuse for turning up late to an event where party members had been charged £25 to meet him.

He complained at the time: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.'

But today he denied believing immigration policy affected his traffic flows: 'It was a joke, I’ve learned something. Never joke. 

'There’s no point is there? Nobody has a sense of humour any more so there is no point doing that.

A month of gaffes by Nigel Farage has led to a slump in voter satisfaction with the Ukip leader.

Rows over breastfeeding, immigrants causing traffic jams and demanding a wreath at the Cenotaph have combined with allegations of a sex scandal involving the party's general secretary and a candidate.

The new IpsosMori survey puts net satisfaction – the percentage of voters satisfied minus the percentage dissatisfied - in Mr Farage's performance as Ukip leader is at its lowest ever level at -20. Only 33 per cent are satisfied and 53 per cent dissatisfied.

This is down from a net score of -6 last month, and down sharply on positive ratings of 11 seen in May last year.

But Mr Farage questioned the credibility of IpsosMori, adding: 'I know that personal ratings are a fickle thing, and this is a very, very volatile time that we are in.'

However, he conceded: 'We’ve had a difficult couple of weeks.'

Mr Smith initially suggested that he had been under great stress at the time of the controversial comments and was taking strong pain killers.

He blamed the rant on 'strong morphine based prescription medication for a back injury'.

Mr Farage tried to laugh off the excuse, adding: ‘I haven’t found sedatives have had that effect on me I have to say.

‘I might have said a few things after other forms of medication that perhaps I shouldn’t have done, but then again we all have haven’t we?’

Mr Farage went on: ‘Kerry himself said that he used language that Del Boy used to use on Only Fools and Horses and nobody objected then.

‘Kerry Smith is not fit to be a parliamentary candidate. I don’t think that in the comments he used he meant malice, that’s the point I’d make.’

Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg yesterday dismissed Ukip as 'just a movement of angry blokes' trying to become a political party.

On his LBC Radio phone-in show Mr Clegg said: 'Of all the excuses for this kind of bile and racist, homophoboic vitriol - 'I was on a sedative' - most people on a sedative don't become Alf Garnett on stilts, do they? Most people on sedatives go to sleep.

'But apparently if you are in Ukip, if you are on a sedative, you just become even more unpleasant.'

The latest IpsosMori survey reveals a dramatic fall in net satisfaction with Nigel Farage as Ukip leader

After a difficult few weeks of infighting, scandals and gaffes, Nigel Farage could be forgiven for seeking a little divine intervention. As the Ukip leader left the LBC studios this morning he was photobombed by  Kevin Lee Light, aka Jesus of Hollywood. The professional Jesus impersonator, who arrived in the UK from LA this week, appeared in the background of photos in central London

But Mr Farage hit back: ‘Thus spoke the man from Westminster school, of vast wealth and the European College in Bruges.

‘If he looked a bit more closely what he would see is we had seven women elected to the European Parliament this year without using all female shortlists. They did it absolutely on merit, with no advantage given to them whatsoever.

‘Nick can abuse us all he likes, I’m not going to return the compliment.’

He insisted that people with offensive views make up a ‘very small proportion’ of Ukip members and candidates.

‘We do not have a monopoly on stupidity, I promise you.’

Mr Farage courted controversy last month when he waded into the row over breastfeeding in public, after a mother at the London hotel Claridge's was asked to cover her baby's head with a napkin.

He suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so.

Sex education policy confusion

Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I've never advocated that policy. If somebody in Ukip in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.'

Ostentatious breastfeeding 

Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' 

Immigrants causing traffic jams

Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.'

General secretary sex scandal 

Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it. Doubts later emerge about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications  

Rate an immigrant game

Dec 13: A Ukip game asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. 

Weeding out the lunatics

Dec 14: Ukip candidates chief David Soutter: 'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' 

Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments 

Dec 15: Kerry Smith forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. 

Taking money from Brussels
