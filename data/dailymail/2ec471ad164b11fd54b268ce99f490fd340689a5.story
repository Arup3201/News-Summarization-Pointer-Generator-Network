When Max Payne was released all those years ago on PS2, a well-known gaming website recommended you bought on that console it if was the only means of playing the game.

See, Max Payne was a PC title, ported and scaled down for console - and during that transition, the quality of the experience suffered slightly.

The same is true of the Battlefield games. If you're after jaw-dropping visuals, photo-realistic character models and want to see the Frostbite 3 Engine in all of its glory, either wait for next-generation offerings or play it on a high-powered PC. If you can't wait that long, current-gen will suffice - but expect the overall experience to take a hit.

Stunning: to get the best out of Battlefield 4, you must play it on a high-end PC or wait for next-gen consoles

At its core, BF4 is a multiplayer game, and this is by far its strongest hand. There are 10 maps in total, all perfectly designed to cater to your gameplay style - whether that's finding a 'quiet' spot and sniping enemies with a high-powered rifle, dog-fighting in a jet-plane or engaging in naval combat.

Destructive environments make a comeback, but its 'Levolution' that steals the show. This introduces massive, destructive events that drastically change the map when certain criteria are met.

These events are best discovered for yourself, even if they become slightly predictable the more you play.

There are also plenty of new modes from Obliteration - that sees two sides fighting to defuse a bomb, to Commander, that caters to the ever-growing second-screen gaming market. The latter sees you get a tactical map of the battlefield where you can direct your team to different points of interest, send in supplies and warn your troops of impending attacks.

There's no ignoring the fact that the campaign, although incredibly entertaining while it lasts, ultimately feels tacked on. It's not helped by a stats counter, rewarding you for killing foes and headshots, that seems completely out of place and acts as a reminder that this is multiplayer game at heart.

Any emotional punch the plot tries to deliver is hence crushed as enemies are not seen as 'living things' but a means of ending the level with the highest score possible.

Still, the five-or-so-hour-long single-player is leagues better than its predecessor's bland effort, featuring set-pieces that give even the most far-fetched Call of Duty moments a run for their money.

Plus, it even features a more than capable performance from its leading men, particularly The Wire's Michael K Williams.

A blast: the single-player story may be lacking in emotion, but it's still a very enjoyable, five-hour thrill ride

Sadly, there's no avoiding the AI problems. Enemies will run right past your teammates and make a beeline for you, take cover right next to your squad mates and launch grenades at every given minute.

These gripes don't massively detract from the experience, but are noticeable throughout the entire campaign.

Even so, Battlefield 4 is a compelling package - one that serves to satisfy both those waiting for a full-fat Call of Duty: Ghosts campaign, and keen multiplayer gamers.

Battlefield 4 is out now.

Test PC was powered by Nvidia 680GTX graphics card in SLI ( a single GTX680 was able to run the game at maximum settings at a smooth framerate, too).
