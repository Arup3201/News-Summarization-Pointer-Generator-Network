Famed fashion photographer Steven Meisel has opened up the doors of his lavish mid-century Los Angeles home, which is rumored to be on the market for $15million.

The 6,300-square-foot mansion, in the exclusive Trousdale Estates area of Beverly Hills, could be straight off the set of Mad Men with its Sixties-inspired architecture and furnishings.

Indeed, you could imagine Don Draper enjoying the luxury perks of one room, which combines a master bathroom and office in one.

A look inside: Fashion photographer Steven Meisel's California home was designed by George MacLean in 1963. Even after renovation, it maintains its Sixties charm with vintage mid-century pieces and accents

Mr Meisel, a notoriously private man, told the Architectural Digest that the 'space was my idea'.

'It just made sense to me - take a shower, get dressed, make a few calls, and do a little work. I love that room,' he said.

Other standout features include mountain views, a large swimming pool and dozens of open-plan rooms decorated with marble, onyx, teak, and walnut detailing. 

Mr Meisel, who is credited with launching the careers of many models, including Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Karen Elson, purchased the property shortly after shooting a Versace campaign in the neighborhood in 2000.

Talking about what attracted him to the dwelling, designed in 1963, by architect George MacLean, he recalled: 'I was told it was built for a race-car driver and his model wife, which sounded just about right.

'The house had never really been renovated, so it felt authentic to the period.'

After he moved in, the property was 
rebuilt and expanded, with architects adding 2,300 square feet to the 
existing 4,000-square-foot building.

However great care was taken to preserve the original Sixties detailing.

Artistic interiors: Mr Meisner came up with the idea for this unique combination office/master bathroom, which features green onyx walls, Jim Thompson silk curtains, and a sculpture by Dorothy Draper

Ron Radziner, of the Los Angeles-based 
firm Marmol Radziner, who served as the project’s lead architect, 
explained that they took the building's original features and 'expanded 
on them'.

'Even though the house is completely 
rebuilt, it still has the same spirit. That was something Steven felt 
very passionate about,' he recounted.

'The greatest thing going for the house was its rough stone walls, which gave it a Hawaiian-ranch-modern feeling.'

Once the building work was complete, water features were installed in the grounds complemented with dense tropical planting.

Chic details: Mr Meisel's bedroom includes vintage Tommi Parzinger lamps, a custom-designed headboard by interior designer Brad Dunning, and rare Macassar ebony bedside tables

'Everything feels very lush and generous,' Mr Radziner added.

For the interiors Mr Meisel recruited designer Brad Dunning, to ensure that the furnishings also had a retro feel.

'This was the most visually confirmed project I’ve ever done,' said Mr Dunning.

'Steven and I both love mining vintage periodicals and books. After going through stacks of archival material, we knew exactly what it was supposed to be.'

The Trousdale Estates was developed in the Fifties and Sixties on a 410-acre plot of land by Paul Trousdale, and consists of luxurious, mostly single-story homes.

While the Trousdales area is popular 
today, luring celebrities such as Simon Cowell, Jennifer Aniston and 
Ellen DeGeneres, it wasn't the place to be when Mr Meisel moved in.

'Back then it wasn’t popular at all. I
remember asking my friend Herb Ritts about it and he told me, "It’s for
old 1960s movie stars. Nobody lives there.’"

However Mr Meisel fell in love with the area and the risk paid off.

'This neighborhood has an incredible history, and it still inspires me,' he said.

'When I moved in, people kept telling me that it wasn’t cool and it wasn’t sophisticated. They were wrong.'
