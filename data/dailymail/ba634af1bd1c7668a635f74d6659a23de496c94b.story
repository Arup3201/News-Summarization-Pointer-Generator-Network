Chancellor George Osborne has only made 40 per cent of cuts so far, but stronger economic growth could spare some future cuts

Britain has become overly dependent on tax revenues from the richest 1 per cent of workers and it would be a ‘risk’ to demand more from them, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned.

Those whose salaries start at £150,000 now account for 27.5 per cent of all income tax paid, up from just 11 per cent in 1979.

These contributions, from just 300,000 people, represent 7.5 per cent of total tax revenue – and the group also pay ‘a large fraction of VAT and capital taxes’.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has announced plans to soak the rich by raising the top rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000.

But the IFS says it is very difficult to assess how workers would behave if tax rates changed – hinting that wealthy individuals could avoid tax or move abroad if the 50p rate returns.

The think-tank said: ‘Increased concentration of revenues from fewer individuals is significant and increases the sensitivity of the Government’s overall revenue position to the incomes and tax-payment behaviour of these individuals.’

The IFS also condemned Labour’s plan to reintroduce the 10p tax rate for the low-paid, saying it would be ‘less well-targeted’ than the Coalition government’s increases to the threshold at which workers must pay basic-rate income tax. ‘It’s hard to find a coherent rationale for it,’ it added.

Last year, Ed Miliband pledged to reintroduce the 10 per cent rate abolished by Gordon Brown in 2007 – funded by a mansion tax on houses worth more than £2million.

The IFS said this policy would cost £7billion – more than Labour has set aside – and introduce ‘unnecessary complexity to the income tax system’.

The intervention is the third time in recent weeks that the IFS has questioned Labour’s policies. Mr Balls claimed raising the top rate of tax could raise an extra £15billion by 2020, but the IFS said the best estimate was just £100million a year.

How less than half of cuts have already been made

The IFS poured cold water on Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's call for further rises to £12,500 in the level at which workers start paying income tax.

Further significant increases in personal allowance would be 'expensive and poorly targeted at helping the low paid', as one in six workers now pay no income tax and would therefore not benefit.

Only 15 per cent of any further rises in the threshold level would go to workers in the bottom half of the earnings ladder, said the IFS.

But the thinktank was even less complimentary about Labour's proposal to restore the 10p starting rate of income tax, saying that it was 'hard to find a coherent economic rationale' for the change.

The plan would be 'if anything, less well targeted on the low paid and would add unnecessary complexity/

The Shadow Chancellor has also pledged to run a surplus on day-to-day Government spending by 2020, in a bid to match George Osborne’s vow to run a surplus on total spending by 2018. The IFS confirmed that this would allow Mr Balls to spend or borrow up to £25billion a year more than the Tories.

The experts also warned the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats that lifting the basic-rate threshold above £10,000 will do little to help the poor because two million have already been lifted out of the income tax system since 2010, as the personal allowance has been raised from £6,475 to £10,000.

From April, the bottom 17 per cent of earners will pay no income tax at all. Any further increase to the tax allowance would cost £12billion, the IFS said – and only 15 per cent of the gains would go towards the poorest half of workers.

The think-tank said the employee National Insurance contribution threshold should be raised above its current level of £7,956 instead.

A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘The Liberal Democrats are nothing other than incredibly proud of the tax cuts we have delivered in Government for ordinary people.

'This policy is about making work pay. The British people have made great sacrifices as we repair the economy after the mess Labour left it in.

‘That is why the Lib Dems are pushing for a further worker’s bonus of a £100 tax cut at the next Budget. People earning £12,500 or a little bit more, who will benefit most from this tax cut, don’t regard themselves as rich and neither do we.’

A Treasury spokesman added: ‘As the IFS say in their report today, the UK economy has gathered momentum and growth is now among the fastest in the developed world.

‘But, as they also say, the largest challenge for the Chancellor remains having to contend with the consequences of the Great Recession for the public finances and household incomes.

‘That is why it’s so important that we continue to work through the long-term plan that is delivering economic security for Britain’s hardworking people.’
