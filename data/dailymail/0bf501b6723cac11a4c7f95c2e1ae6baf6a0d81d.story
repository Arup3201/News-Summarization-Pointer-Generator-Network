A four-year-old boy is dead and his mom seriously injured following a head-on collision with a drunk driver on Friday afternoon on Georgia Highway 17.

Owen Rivers of Guyton was pronounced dead shortly after the crash, while his mom Adrianna Flowers, 22, was taken to Memorial Health University Center with serious injuries.

The incident happened around 3 p.m., when Effingham County Sheriff’s Office received a call from a motorist who reported that a man in a Jeep was driving recklessly and crossing lanes.

‘Within less than 60 seconds, the complainant told the communications officer that the driver of the Jeep crossed the center line and hit a white sedan head-on,’ Sheriff’s spokesman David Ehsanipoor said.

‘Deputies, fire crews and first responders arrived on the scene moments later and began rescue efforts trying to save a small child who was not breathing as well as attempting to extricate two adults who were trapped in their vehicles,’ Ehsanipoor said.

The other injured party was the driver of the Jeep. Robert Waugh, 38, of Guyton, was air lifted to hospital with life threatening injuries, reports WJCL.

He was wanted on a probation violation for charges of obstruction of law enforcement and was driving on a suspended license.

Ehsanipoor said alcohol was found in the Jeep. The crash remains under investigation by the Georgia State Patrol’s Special Collision Reconstruction Team.

The boy and his mother had been on their way to visit his grandparents.

A friend of Adrianna Flowers has setup a GoFundMe.com page to help raise funds for the burial of Owen and her mom’s recovery.

‘Adrianna is suffering many horrific, painstaking injuries. She will have a very long road to recovery, both physically and emotionally,’ wrote Kacee DeVore on the page.

To date, over $11,000 dollars has been raised to help cover the many expenses facing the injured mother. The goal is to raise $20,000.
