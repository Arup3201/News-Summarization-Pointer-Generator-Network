West Brom are closing in on the signing of Shola Ameobi.

The former Newcastle striker is available on a free transfer after leaving Turkish side Gaziantep.

The Baggies have agreed a deal with the 33-year-old as head coach Tony Pulis looks to beef up his forward line.

Brown Ideye has flopped since a £10million summer move from Dynamo Kiev, scoring just twice, and Georgios Samaras is set to join Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia.

Saido Berahino has netted 14 times but Pulis has confirmed he wants to add extra firepower.

He signed Ameobi on loan at Stoke in 2008 with the forward playing six times without scoring.

Ameobi scored 79 goals in 397 appearances for Newcastle before leaving St James’ Park last year after 14 years.

He moved to Gaziantep in August but left in December.

The Baggies go to Birmingham in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, although Ameobi is unlikely to have joined by then, and they are 14th in the Barclays Premier League.
