A 19-year-old man in Tacoma, Washington, has pleaded guilty to raping and murdering his girlfriend's two-year-old son.

Jake Musga pleaded guilty on Monday to first degree murder and child rape in the death of Laura Colley’s son Chayson.

He could spend the rest of his life in prison after prosecutors confirmed that they will be asking the judge to sentence Musga to 60 years to life when he is sentenced in November.

When Chayson Colley, held here by  his mom Laura, was taken to hospital doctors said he showed no significant brain activity, had bleeding in his brain and stomach, had suffered a collapsed lung and bruising around his rectum

Jake Musga, 19, from Tacoma, Washington is facing life in prison after pleading guilty on Monday to raping and murdering Laura Colley's two-year-old son Chayson

The incident happened on March 30, when a witness called 911 to report that they had found Musga holding a baby ‘covered with bruises’ at the Commencement Terrace apartment complex.

Chayson was taken to a local hospital where doctors said he showed no significant brain activity, had bleeding in his brain and stomach, had suffered a collapsed lung and bruising around his rectum, and registered a blood-alcohol level of .12, court records show. The legal limit for drivers in Washington is .08.

Musga, who is not the child's father, told Tacoma police that he was watched the child when the boy's mother was out at a party, reports The News Tribune.

According to police, he claimed the injuries resulted from a series of events days earlier where the boy had accidents, such as bumping his head on a counter, slipping in the shower, and falling out of bed.

He also claimed he had poured himself a drink with multiple shots of vodka and that the boy must have drank some while he was in another room.

But an autopsy revealed the boy had suffered injuries ‘too numerous to count,’ including fatal blows to the head and torso that were inconsistent with the events Musga described, prosecutors said.

Musga initially pleaded not guilty to the crimes, but has since admitted to the murder and acknowledged the crimes warrant an exceptional sentence, prosecutors say.

In his plea paperwork Musga admitted that he killed Chayson because the toddler had urinated on him.

‘Nothing shocks the conscience more than the murder of a child,’ said prosecutor Mark Lindquist. ‘We are asking the court for the functional equivalent of a life-sentence.’

The standard sentence range is 22 years to life in prison, but prosecutors will be asking the judge to sentence Musga to 60 years to life. When he is sentenced in November.

At Chayson’s funeral in April his mom’s family celebrated his short life and fondly recalled how he had learned how to say ‘Love you’ in the last weeks of his life.

During the service, Laura Colley wrote and read what she characterized as a letter to her son in heaven, reports TheDailyWorld.com.

‘To my beloved son, Chayson, my favorite part of the day was at the end of the day when we were both so tired and we would lay together with your hand in mine and you would look up at me and smile and grab my face with both your hands and kiss me,’ she wrote.

‘And you would say, “Love you!” and I’d say it back. It felt so good to be loved by you. You were my every reason for being.

'No matter how long, bad or rough the day was, when I would hear you laugh, everything became good again. It was true bliss being with you. My heart will ache every day until we are together again.’
