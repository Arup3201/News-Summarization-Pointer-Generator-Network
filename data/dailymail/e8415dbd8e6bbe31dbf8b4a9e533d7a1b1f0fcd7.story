Energy companies are making £53 profit from every customer on the back of spiralling prices and a long cold winter.

Industry
regulator Ofgem said the amount has soared by an astonishing 76 per 
cent in a year – from an average of £30 in 2011 to the £53 figure for 
2012.

The details are 
included in an  official study which also shows that profits from 
supplying households are up five-fold since 2009 – rising from 
£221million to £1.19billion.

Gas and electricity bills for every home and business now make even more profit for energy firms

Profits on the average bill have risen from £8 in 2009 to £53 in 2012, fuelled by a bitterly cold winter

The
increase will infuriate  customers who are struggling to keep warm and 
cover the cost of other essentials such as food and transport.

Figures published today are expected to show that thousands of elderly died last winter from conditions exacerbated by the cold.

At
the same time, the screw is being tightened further as the ‘big six’ 
energy firms are in the midst of a new round of price hikes.

British
Gas, the biggest supplier, has just increased its tariffs by 10.4 per 
cent for electricity and 8.4 per cent on gas – adding around £123 a year
to bills.

Ofgem said the 
company’s profit margin was some 6.6 per cent in 2012, which was the 
highest of the big suppliers and ahead of the 5 per cent claimed by 
executives.  Looking at the supply of gas to households alone, its 
profit margin was 11.2 per cent, while the figure for its rival SSE was 
higher still at 11.4 per cent.

Audrey
Gallacher, director of energy pressure group Consumer Futures, said: 
‘The increase in supplier profits contrasts with declining 
affordability. The sector is riding out tough economic times better than
its customers.

‘Energy 
costs remain a concern for households, and are set to rise further with 
the costs to make energy supply greener and more secure.

Profits made from every domestic customer soared in just a year to £53, energy watchdog Ofgem said

‘Fuel
poverty levels in the UK are extremely high. The Government’s Fuel 
Poverty Advisory Group estimates there are now at least 6.5million 
households affected.

‘More needs to be done to help consumers, ideally with a robust and well-targeted energy efficiency programme.’

The
Ofgem figures show that the average percentage profit margin per 
household customer rose from 2.8 per cent in 2011 to 4.3 per cent in 
2012.

The big energy 
companies insist these figures are reasonable and relatively small when 
set against the margins made by some other businesses, such as 
supermarkets.

Ofgem released this graph showing average profit margins from 2009 to 2012 for all parts of the supply businesses of the Big Six

However, 
Ofgem revealed that the profit margins made by these same companies on 
the electricity and gas they both generate and supply is a whopping 20 
per cent, which is high by most standards.

Adding
the money made from generation to the total for selling power to the 
public, total profits for the big six suppliers last year were 
£3.7billion.

The major 
energy firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, Eon, EDF and Scottish Power – 
claim recent rises in bills are the result of an increase in wholesale 
energy costs and the Government’s green taxes.

Total profit margins varied markedly between the companies for supplying gas and electricity to homes and businesses in 2012

However,
the Ofgem figures show that the increased profit margins has also hit 
customers in the pocket during what is already a crippling cost of 
living squeeze.

An 
independent study commissioned by Ofgem concludes that the wholesale 
cost of energy did rise in 2012, while the firms also faced bigger bills
to access the national grid of pipes and cables.

However,
it said: ‘The profit margin that suppliers on average earned from each 
consumer also increased, from £30 in 2011 to £53 in 2012. There is some 
evidence of rising profit margins. This rise has been due to a 
combination of higher prices and volumes rather than lower costs.’

Campaigners are due to hold protests over rising bills at the offices of British Gas and Npower today.

The biggest driver of increases in bills was rising wholesale costs, adding £75 to the average customer

James Grainger, of Fuel Poverty Action, said: ‘The big six are lying to us when they say the problem is “green taxes”.

‘The real problems are the big six’s profiteering and the rising cost of polluting energy like oil  and gas.’

Energy
UK, which speaks for suppliers, said the Ofgem figures were misleading 
and failed to take account of the billions of pounds being spent on 
developing new power stations and wind farms.

It
said: ‘The main reasons customers have seen their household bills go up
is because the cost of gas and electricity have gone up as well as 
other add-ons, such as the social and environmental policies, rising 
fast.’

Rising costs: Households have seen their energy bills surge over the past decade

If you have never switched
suppliers, or haven't switched for an extended period of time, then now
is the time to do it. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online 
tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

But suppliers tend to charge 
more for electricity to those customers who live in their 'home' region -
the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly before energy deregulation. So 
switching away will almost always save you money.

Prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for 
you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the 
tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.

The
simplest and often best way to switch energy bills is to use an online 
service, which can compare the tariffs on offer for you.

One way 
of doing that to find the cheapest energy supplier for you is by using
