Jack Wilshere opted to keep his feet up at home as a star-studded crowd watched Monday night's FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford.

But the 23-year-old can now look forward to a date at Wembley next month as he closes in on his first-team return, after his side went on to beat the Red Devils 2-1. 

The Arsenal ace has been out of action since last November after injuring his ankle against Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League.

Wilshere could be back for the Gunners' must-win Champions League showdown with Monaco next week. 

But the England star settled for the view from his sofa as he cheered his team-mates on from home, hoping the FA Cup holders will book a place in next month's semi-finals at Wembley.

Inside Old Trafford, meanwhile, legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson took his usual seat in the directors box with Louis van Gaal left to pick up his old sparring role with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.

Banned defender Jonny Evans was forced to watch from the stands too as he serves his six-match ban for spitting at Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse last week.

Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel joined his father, Peter, as the iconic goalkeeper savoured the atmosphere at his former club and took pictures of the crowd before the game from his phone.

Another former United favourite Roy Keane also returned, taking up a pundit role in the BBC studio alongside host Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Ian Wright.
