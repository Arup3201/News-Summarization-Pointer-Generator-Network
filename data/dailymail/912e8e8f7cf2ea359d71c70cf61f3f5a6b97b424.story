While it may sound to many men like more of a blessing than a curse, Dale Decker claims that his 100 daily orgasms are a hell that has ruined his life.

The 37-year-old, from Wisconsin, developed persistent genital arousal syndrome in September 2012 after slipping a disc in his back while getting out of a chair.

Speaking on ITV’s this morning, the father of two explains: ‘It’s completely changed everything I have ever done. I can’t do anything, I can’t get a job. You have to understand that in America 90 per cent of the jobs are service industry and nobody would ever put me in front of their customers so working is pretty much out of the question.’

Dale spoke about his rare and little understood condition on ITV's This Morning via video call

Dale’s condition has affected not only his ability to hold down a job but his family life, even occurring during his own father’s funeral

Unable even to do simple things like play baseball with his two sons, Dale feels particularly awkward when it happens around children.

Becoming obviously tearful as he spoke, Dale says: ‘I don’t go around kids. My own children didn’t even know what the word orgasm was until Tuesday when some kids in school had apparently seen the video on YouTube. How do you explain an orgasm to an 11-year-old child?’

The 37-year-old became very distressed when discussing the consequences of his condition 

According to medical literature, trauma to the pelvic nerves can trigger hypersensitivity in this area.

The painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated, through fear of suffering a public orgasm, with some even causing him to drop to the floor.

‘There are different intensities. The ones that cause me to fall to the floor feel like all the muscles from my chest to my thighs have gone rock hard and everything just seizes up.

‘It hurts and it feels good at the same time and you have all these things running through your head as they happen. You don’t want to be around anyone and you don’t want anyone to see it,’ Dale explains, speaking via video call from America.

Mr Decker lives in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, with his wife April and two sons Christian, 12, and Tayten, 11.

While doing all she can to support her husband, Mrs Decker said his condition is 'hard to live with'.

She said: 'We really struggle right now as he is unable to work and supply for his family and I feel like all the strain is on me.

'It's really upsetting, we don't do things that man and wife should do and we argue over things that should not be affecting us.

Despite suffering from a near constant erection Dale and his wife April (right) rarely have sex

'Because he sometimes has episodes at night we took the decision to sleep in separate beds.’

'He struggles to be a good father to the children because they obviously don't understand what is happening,' his wife added.

'He can't take them to practice - can't play ball with them, it's really hard.'

Despite suffering from a near constant erection Mr and Mrs Decker rarely have sex.

'Occasionally we will but it's very frustrating for both of us,' Mr Decker said.

'I've tried reading about it, tried going to doctors but nobody can help me - I don't know what I'm going to do.

'I just want to get my old life back - I just want to get back what this condition has taken from me.'
