A plane crash in Arizona left one person dead and five injured Saturday after high winds caused difficulties as the aircraft attempted to land after a sight-seeing flight.

The single engine Cessna 207 was carrying a pilot and six French tourists as it approached an airport in Page, about 200 miles north of Phoenix, and somehow toppled over and landed on its roof.

The aircraft is shown in a photo sitting upside-down hundreds of feet short of the airport runway, but it is not clear exactly how much damage was sustained.

Deadly crash: one person died and five were injured when this plane came up short of the runway and flipped over on impact

'The plane hit the sand and flipped over upside down,' a police spokesperson said.

Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the plane crash-landed 400 to 500 feet short of the runway.

One passenger died after being rushed to a hospital, while another was taken to Flagstaff Medical Center. The deceased person has not yet been identified, but the hospitalized passenger is said to be in stable condition.

Four others received hospital treatment for minor injuries and were released, while the seventh person was unhurt, authorities said. The pilot was among the injured.

The passengers were all part of a French tour group, they have not been named.

Both the captain and the FAA website listed the aircraft's registered owner as American Aviation Inc. of Salt Lake City.

A person answering the phone there late Saturday said they didn't have any information.

Varner said that the hometowns of the passengers were still being determined, but at least one of them was from the French city of Le Havre.

There was no immediate word on the cause of the crash. Both Gregor and Varner said it was being investigated.
