Kristen Taylor had just bought a black Infiniti and was still learning how to use a stick shift when her car got stuck on the train tracks in Maitland, Florida.

A video released by the Florida Department of Transportation this week showed the heart-stopping  moment a SunRail locomotive slammed into Taylor's brand-new car Monday afternoon just a few seconds after the driver narrowly escaped certain death. 

According to police, Ms Taylor, of Altamonte Springs, was heading west on Packwood Avenue in Maitland just after 2pm Monday when her Infiniti stalled at the rail crossing.

Nick of time: With not a moment to spare, the driver jumped out of the car in front the barreling locomotive

The woman tried to restart the car, but to no avail. That is when she saw a 145-ton SunRail commuter train with three cars attached to the locomotive coming directly at her, Orlando Sentinel reported.

The train slowed from 45mph to 35mp as it rounded the bend 100 yards from the Maitland stop, but it was not enough to prevent the collision.

In the dashcam video, the train quickly closes in on the car stuck on the tracks.

Inside, the train conductor identified as Frederick Robillard sounds the horn, slams on the breaks, and then braces for impact.

‘The engineer was braking and braking hard and trying to get that train to stop, but it can’t just stop on an instant. A train has a lot of weight,’ Florida Department of Transportation spokesman Steve Olson told Bay News 9.

A moment before the crash, Ms Taylor wearing a purple dress could be seen jumping out of the driver's side, after which the train runs over the Infiniti, sending bits of debris flying everywhere.

Speaking to ClickOrlando, Taylor said she could not hear the sound of the warning horns because her music was loud.

The 28-year-old woman, who suffered minor injuries from flying debris, said her Infiniti was totaled. Her first payment on the car was due Monday. 

The motorist insisted that she was not trying to beat the train.
