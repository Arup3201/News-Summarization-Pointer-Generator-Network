In 1995 Colmans Mustard was purchased from Reckitt and Colman PLC and it became part of Unilever.

Lesley Owen-Edwards, archivist at Unilever, said: 'Colman's English Mustard has been a larder staple for 200 years in the UK.

'It
 is still a quintessentially British brand, it's still made in Norwich 
with English mustard seeds from Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and 
Lincolnshire.

'It's still all about bringing families together through home-cooked food.

'We
 make more than 3,000 tonnes of mustard and export all over the world, 
including to Europe, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and China.

'People used to buy the mustard powder in small quantities and in the 1880s Colmans began producing penny oval tins.

'It
 was a product that was available to everyone and the tins were quite 
collectible as they had the flags of different countries on them.

'Not only was it a popular condiment, but there were perceived health benefits from mustard at the time.

'People believed that if you put the powder in the bath it would improve your circulation and arthritis.

'There is an oil by-product that is produced when mustard seeds are ground up and people began asking for it.

'In the early days they gave it away and people would rub it on their joints, and they also thought it had digestive qualities.'
