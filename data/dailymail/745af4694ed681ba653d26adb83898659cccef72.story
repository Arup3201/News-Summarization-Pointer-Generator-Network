Blood-red tears on their cheeks and stick figures looking out helplessly from behind bars -Â  these touching sketches illustrate the plight of children being held in immigration detention centres across Australia and offshore, and will feature in a human rights inquiry today in Canberra.

One of the drawings shows two female figures begging for help while another shows an asylum seeker in a cage as an Australian family look on.

The common theme in most of the pictures is sad looking figures looking through bars at a world they have been dreaming of since leaving their home countries.

These compelling images, which were used as part of the first stage of the Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into children in detention earlier in the year, have resurfaced as the federal government's medical health provider fronts the inquiry today.

The commission's president Dr Gillian Triggs told the Sydney Morning Herald that the International Health and Medical Service had been widely criticised for the treatment of children living in detention centres across Australia and the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

Dr Triggs gave the examples of the girl who could lose her eyesight because she wasn't given glasses for 11 months, and another child who was not given access to a specialist for a spinal deformity for six months.

Meanwhile, the Federal Government is still refusing to confirm reports that two boats were intercepted by Australian authorities off Christmas Island on Saturday.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison insisted he would only confirm incidents that involve safety of life at sea.

One of the boats is reportedly carrying 153 Tamil asylum seekers, including about 30 children - many of them sick - while the other has 50 people aboard.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says his government was determined to maintain its record of six months without an asylum seeker boat.

'I'm not going to comment on the operational detail of what happens on the water but obviously we have been successful up to now,' he said.

'It's more than six months since a successful people-smuggling venture made it to Australia and that's a record that the government is determined to maintain.'
