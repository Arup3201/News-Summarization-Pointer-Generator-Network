Sir Sean Connery has been questioned about links to convicted criminals as part of a court probe into the sale of his former Spanish home, it emerged today.

The sale of Sir Sean's Marbella home, which was demolished to make way for luxury apartments in 1999, was probed as part of an investigation into two corrupt former mayors of Marbella jailed for crimes including embezzlement and fraud.

Sir Sean was quizzed on whether he had offshore firms, had ever given gifts to Land Registry workers and what his relationship was with Jesus Gil and Julian Munoz as well as ex-town hall planning chief Juan Antonio Roca.

The uncomfortable questions were laid bare by a Spanish newspaper which today published leaked extracts of a sworn statement Sir Sean made at a lawyer’s office near his home in the Bahamas.

The affidavit - in which Sir Sean denied all the claims made against him - is now in the hands of an investigating magistrate in Marbella who is probing the 1999 sale of Sir Sean’s home in the resort and its subsequent demolition to make way for a luxury apartment block built in breach of planning regulations.

Nearly 20 people, including two lawyers who represented the actor in Spain and a former town hall planning chief, are facing trial on charges including bribery, fraud and tax crimes.

The case has been dubbed ‘Goldfinger’ after the 1964 James Bond film Connery starred in.

The investigating magistrate in charge of the pre-trial probe is set to decide Sir Sean’s fate after studying the 56-page affidavit, ordered more than three years ago.

The former 007, who has not been charged or accused of any crime, is expected to react furiously to its leaking in Costa del Sol-based Spanish-language daily ‘SUR’.

The respected paper printed the front page of his affidavit which included his address in the Bahamas.

SUR reported Sir Sean was asked in documents if he had any relationship with corrupt former Marbella mayors Jesus Gil and Julian Munoz and jailed former town hall planning chief Juan Antonio Roca.

He is said to have denied any relationship with the trio and said of Gil, a populist right-winger whose corruption turned Marbella into a haven for gangsters: ’I believe I saw him in a public engagement and don’t consider that can be defined as me knowing him.’ He also denied involvement in two firms linked to an alleged multi-million pound fraud relating to the property deal involving Sir Sean’s former home around the time it was completed, SUR reported.

The newspaper said he was asked if he had profited from the operation, owned companies in offshore locations including the Isle of Man or Uruguay where cash from the suspect real estate deal is thought to have been laundered, or given gifts to Land Registry workers in Marbella.

His response to all three questions was ‘No’, SUR said.

Sir Sean signed the affidavit - witnessed by a Bahamas-based QC and a lawyer who has advised him on Spanish law - on February 21 2012.

It was only handed to the investigating magistrate in Marbella, who is conducting his probe in secret, on January 21 this year.

The reason for the delay, which prompted the magistrate to threaten the Scots actor and his wife with international arrest warrants last May before he received the affidavit, has not been made clear.

Done and dusted: Sir Sean Connery's Spanish home Casa Malibu in Marbella, which was sold in 1999

Sir Sean sold his Marbella home Casa Malibu in 1999 and it was subsequently demolished.

More than 70 flats, later sold for an estimated £45million, were built in its place despite planning regulations stipulating only five flats could be built there. Connery has been alleged to have failed to pay tax on the deal.

More than 20 people, including corrupt former town hall officials and Connery’s lawyers, were called to give evidence in private court hearings designed to determine if charges should be laid.

Sir Sean and his wife, implicated in the probe in May 2010 following a police raid on the offices of his Spanish-based lawyers, cited health reasons for failing to attend an October 2010 summons for questioning.

The court heading the Goldfinger probe - Marbella’s Investigating Court Number One - recommended last September 17 people should stand trial.

State prosecutors are expected to demand jail sentences of up to 34 years for the suspects.

A decision on the fate of Sir Sean and his wife, delayed while the investigating magistrate waited for a response to his international ‘letter of request’, is expected shortly.

Sir Sean has already threatened reprisals over leaks linking him to the criminal investigation.

In a furious letter forwarded to Ricardo Puyol by Britain’s Ambassador to Spain in October 2010, he warned he was considering legal action and demanded to know what proof court officials had to support the suspicion he may have committed any wrongdoing.

Excerpts of the letter were leaked to a Spanish paper after officials questioned the British Embassy’s role in the affair.

Michelle Roquebrune, Sir Sean’s second wife, has previously claimed: ‘These allegations of money-laundering are nonsense.

‘We have nothing to do with this. We sold the property and that is it.’

No-one was available today at the office of Diaz-Bastien & Truan, which has previously declined all requests for comment.
