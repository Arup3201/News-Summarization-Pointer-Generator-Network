The Twelve Days Of Christmas don't have much appeal to the modern woman - most ladies these days would prefer a cashmere sweater or a designer handbag to a partridge in a pear tree. 

But it's just as well, as the price of keeping your true love happy is $27,673.22 (£17,766) if you bought everything on the list once. 

That is up by one per cent on 2013's total, which was $27,393.17 (£17,606.56)

US company PNC Wealth Mgmt has worked out the cost of the gifts in the song every year since 1984, when it totalled $12,673 (£8,160), it is now $27,673 (£17,766) 

The increase is the smallest since 2002, when the cost fell 7.6 per cent.

PNC Wealth Management has worked out the cost of the twelve days of gifts every year since 1984, when the items totalled $12,673.56 (£8,160.17).

They also broke down the prices for each individual item. 

Two turtle doves, cost $125 (£80.29), the same as last year, while five gold rings cost $750 (£481.76)

Nine ladies dancing (per performance) cost $7,553 (£4,851.67), while seven swans a-swimming are worth $7,000 (£4,496.45)

While many of the gifts were the same cost as last year, like the two turtle doves, the seven swans-a-swimming and the nine ladies dancing, several had also gone up in value. 

10 lords-a-leaping had gone up from $5,243 (£3,365.97) last year, to $5,348 (£3,433.38) now, although Femail thinks it would be tough to find any real lords to leap for that price. 

The price of a partridge (who sits in the pear tree) has gone up by a third this year - it is now $20 (£12.85) instead of $15 (£9.64)
