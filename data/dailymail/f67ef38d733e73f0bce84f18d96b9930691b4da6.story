A teenager died after accidentally taking his father's medicine, an inquest heard today.

Sixth-former Paul Hurst, 18, mistakenly took a mixture of medication.

A friend found the 'talented and fun-loving' student unconscious on a beanbag at his home.

Talented sixth-former Paul Hurst, 18, died after mistakenly taking his father's medicine

Paul was taken to hospital but could not be revived.

His father, also called Paul, told the inquest: 'I kept the three drugs in a kitchen cupboard - Paul had never expressed any interest in taking the medication.

'He was a wonderful human being and always saw the good side in people.

The inquest heard that Paul's death was the result of his own actions, even though it was unintentional

'The only thing he ever wanted was to be loved - he brightened up everyone's life.'

Paul was found dead at his home in Wellington, Hereford, in November last year.

The Hereford inquest heard younger Paul suffered from the medical condition dyspraxia which caused him to have a lack of awareness of danger and a 'sense of invincibility'.

Detective Sgt Tim Powell told the inquest that Paul's death was the result of his own actions, even though it was unintentional.

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Dyspraxia is a life-long common disorder that affects movement, co-ordination and social skills. It is also known as developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD).

Dyspraxia affects basic motor skills - such as walking - and fine motor skills -such as writing - in children and adults, the NHS says.

Adults with the condition can suffer social and emotional difficulties, as well as problems with time management and organisation.

The condition is believed to affect around five to six per cent of people in the UK.

Men are more disposed to suffer from it, and it tends to run in families.
