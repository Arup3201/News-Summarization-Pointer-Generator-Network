David Cameron was today forced to defend the fawning tributes paid to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia – despite his country’s shameful record on human rights.

The Prime Minister insisted Britain needs a relationship with oil giants in the Middle East, regardless of their legal systems.

And he revealed that Saudi Arabia supplied a piece of counter-terrorism intelligence that saved hundreds of lives in Britain.

Mr Cameron was heavily criticised last month after flags flew at half mast over Buckingham Palace, Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament to mark the death of King Abdullah.

The Prime Minister jetted to the Gulf with Prince Charles to pay tribute to the authoritarian and hugely powerful monarch.

Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, condemned the decision to fly flags at half mast as ‘a steaming pile of nonsense’. She added that it was a ‘stupid act on its own and a stupid precedent to set’.

Saudi Arabia, which last year is reported to have carried out 87 beheadings, has attracted further outrage after the first public flogging of blogger Raif Badawi, 31, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and ten years in jail for highlighting the kingdom’s harsh laws on dissent.

But Mr Cameron insisted that concerns about human rights had to be weighed against co-operation from Saudi Arabia in cracking down on terrorists.  

The Prime Minister insisted his first duty was to protect the public, even if that means doing business with regimes he 'didn't always agree with'.

Appearing on the Ask The Leaders event organised by Sky News and Facebook, Mr Cameron said: 'I can tell you one time since I've been Prime Minister, a piece of information that we have been given by that country has saved potentially hundreds of lives here in Britain.

'Now, you can be Prime Minister and say exactly what you think about every regime in the world and make great headlines, and give great speeches.

'But I think my first job is to try and keep this country safe from terrorism and if that means you have to build strong relationships sometimes with regimes you don't always agree with, that I think is part of the job and that is the way I do it. And that is the best way I can explain it.'

Mr Cameron was asked whether the relationship with Saudi Arabia was based on the fact it had huge oil reserves.

In a bluntly honest response he admitted: 'Yes, of course. Of course Britain needs to have relationships with countries we trade with, including those that we buy oil and gas from. We can't make all our oil and gas here in the UK, we're doing well because we've got North Sea Oil,' he said.

Mr Cameron stressed that he raised human rights with regimes that had dubious records.

'It's perfectly possible to go to those countries as I do and raise human rights abuses.

'In fact I would argue that if you have a relationship with them and you have a way of talking to them they are more likely to listen to you than if you just cut yourself off.' 

Supporters of King Abdullah, who was succeeded by his 79-year-old half-brother Salman, claim that the absolute ruler followed a difficult path maintaining good relations with the West – Saudi Arabia is a key ally in the war on terror as well as an important business partner for the UK – while putting into place mild reforms.

Soon after his death, Mr Cameron said the king ‘will be remembered for his long years of service to the Kingdom, for his commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths’.
