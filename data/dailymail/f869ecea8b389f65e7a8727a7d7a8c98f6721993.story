Tony Blair was given a gong at the Polish Business Leaders Awards in Warsaw

In Britain, his ‘open door’ immigration policies have been criticised by all sides.

But in Poland, which was transformed by entry into the EU, Tony Blair is feted as a hero.

And yesterday the former Prime Minister was handed a special award for helping hundreds of thousands of Poles come to live in the UK.

He was honoured with the gong at the annual Polish Business Leaders Awards ceremony in Warsaw.

Mr Blair's prize paid tribute to his backing for Poland’s efforts to join the EU, opening up the British labour market to Poles and overseeing a growth in trade between the two countries while in office.

A golden statuette was accepted in his absence by Robin Barnett, Britain’s ambassador in Poland.

But Mr Blair recorded a video message for the audience at Warsaw’s National Opera house, in which he said ‘As you know, Poland is a country I admire greatly.

'I admire the Polish people greatly. I'd like to thank you for the contribution you've made to the European Union since you joined, and to my country, to Britain, both at the workplace and in society.

'This is a difficult economic time 
and I know the Business Centre Club of Poland do fantastic work. So to 
be given this award for the contribution I have made, in my way, to 
relations between Britain and Poland, between British people and Polish people is an especial honour.'

The award, referred to as the ‘Special Prize’, is awarded to a figure from outside the world of business who has helped Poland.

Previous winners include Margaret Thatcher, Bill Clinton and Bertie Ahern. Mr Blair shared it with two Poles, former defence minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz and former deputy prime minister Janusz Steinhoff.

Around 700,000 eastern Europeans 
migrated to the UK form eight former communist nations when they were 
admitted to the European Union in 2004 – despite ministers predicting 
only 15,000 a year would arrive.

Between December 2003 and December 2010 the Polish-born population of the UK increased from 75,000 to 532,000.

Latest census figures reveal that the number of Poles living in Britain now stands at 625,000.

Tory MP Philip Hollobone, raged last night: ‘This award is entirely appropriate.

‘Tony Blair presided over the biggest wave of immigration this country has seen since the Norman conquest, 2.5million net migrants came in to the UK while he was in charge and Britain will never be the same again’.

Ed Miliband spoke out last year to 
say the relaxation of immigration controls – under which only Britain, 
Ireland and Sweden allowed people from new member countries unrestricted
 rights to live and work - were a ‘mistake’.

Mr Miliband said the Labour government
 had underestimated both the numbers of Polish immigrants and the ‘big 
effect’ it had on living standards for working-class households.

But
 Mr Blair recently defended his record, saying Polish immigrants did 
‘good work in our country’ and that ‘most sensible people’ appreciated 
their contribution to Britain.
