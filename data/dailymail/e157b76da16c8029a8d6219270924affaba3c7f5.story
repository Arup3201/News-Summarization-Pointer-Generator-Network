Scientists claim that eating lots of sugar (illustrated) and other carbohydrates, harms both the brain's structure and function

A diet high in sugar could be damaging your brain as well as inflating your waistline, scientists have warned.

In the past research has linked sugary foods with obesity but a new study has now found the risks associated with a sugar laden diet could have more widespread health implications, eating away at a person's brain power.

A team at Charité University Medical Centre in Berlin found eating lots of sugar and other carbohydrates harms both the brain's physical structure as well as its function.

They discovered high levels of glucose are associated with worse memory in healthy adults and could poetntially lead to more people suffering dementia.

The new research backs up previous studies, which have shown that diabetes - characterised by high levels of blood glucose - has been linked to an increased risk of dementia, Scientific American reported.

Experts have also previously found that high blood sugar levels are linked to a smaller hippocampus, which is an area of the brain used for remembering events and facts.

AS part of the new study, scientists wanted to find out whether glucose has a negative effect on memory in healthy people without diabetes.

They looked at short-term and long-term glucose markers in 141 healthy adults without any signs of diabetes, who took a memory test.

The participants also underwent an MRI scan to examine the structure of their hippocampus.

The experiment revealed that higher glucose blood levels were linked with bad memory as well as a smaller hippocampus.

Agnes
 Flöel, a neurologist at Charité and co-author of the study, said 
the results ‘provide further evidence that glucose might directly 
contribute to hippocampal atrophy'.

However, she said the study cannot confirm a causal relation between brain health and eating lots of sugar.

Scientists will explore whether dietary and lifestyle changes might reverse changes in the brain.

Experts recently urged people to halve their sugar intake to just five teaspoons a day, in order to tackle soaring obesity levels.

Guidelines from scientists advising Public Health England - the agency given the job of tackling obesity - said that women should have no more than five to six teaspoons of sugar a day, and men seven to eight.

Currently, Britons consume an average of 15 teaspoons daily, mainly due to the high volumes of sugar hidden in everyday items such as fruit juice, muesli, yoghurts, sandwiches and ready meals.

Senior doctors and academics want the Government to force food manufacturers to cut sugar levels, ensure products are clearly labelled and impose a tax on soft drinks, but so far, options are only being considered.

In the meantime, experts are advising parents to ban fruit juice, squash and soft drinks from the dinner table and give their children only water and milk.

While some parents think that fruit juice is healthy, nutritionists have pointed out that it has played a part in fuelling sharp rises in obesity rates, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

A typical teenager consumes 40 per cent more sugar than they should and Adults take in 13 per cent too much.

A study published in the British Medical Journal last month, claims that more than one in three adults have 'pre-diabetes,' a term used to indicate that a person has raised sugar levels and is therefore at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes, which develops in adulthood, can shave six years off a person's life.

Diabetes UK said that more than 280,000 people a year are diagnosed with diabetes ¿ the equivalent of the population of Newcastle upon Tyne

New figures show hundreds of people are diagnosed with diabetes every day in Britain.

Diabetes UK said that more than 280,000 people a year are diagnosed with diabetes – the equivalent of the population of Newcastle upon Tyne.

Each day 738 people are told that they have type 2 diabetes – which is linked to being overweight – and 30 are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which is not linked to weight.

About 3.8million people in the UK now have the condition and about 35 per cent of the population have borderline diabetes.

Diabetes UK has called for more focus on preventing type 2 diabetes, saying that if the rate of people developing the condition continues the consequences could be ‘disastrous’.

The charity’s chief executive,  Barbara Young, said: ‘It is deeply worrying that more than 700 people a day are being diagnosed with diabetes and this clearly shows the frightening scale of what is fast becoming a national health emergency.

‘If we continue to see people being diagnosed at this rate then the consequences will be disastrous.

‘As the number of people with diabetes grows, we are likely to see even more people endure devastating health complications such as amputation and kidney failure and more people die tragically young.

'It would also lead to an increase in NHS costs that would be simply unsustainable. As a country, we are still not giving diabetes healthcare the priority it needs and we also need to get much better at preventing type 2 diabetes before it is too late.’
