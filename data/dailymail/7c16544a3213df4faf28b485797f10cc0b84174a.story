U.S. athlete Torrin Lawrence has died after a semi truck slammed into his broken-down car on a Georgia highway.

Lawrence's car suffered a puncture on Interstate 75 near Cordele early on Monday and came a stop in the middle of traffic in the three-lane highway around 1.45am.

The running star, 25, climbed out and called 911 but his vehicle could not be driven after the blowout so he left it in the flow of traffic, Crisp County Sheriff Billy Hancock told WALB.

A semi truck slammed into the vehicle and the car hit Lawrence, killing him.
