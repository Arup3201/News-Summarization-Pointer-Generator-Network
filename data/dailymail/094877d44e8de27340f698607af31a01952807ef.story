An SAS counter-terrorist rescue team is primed and ready to deploy on a mission to fly into Syria and rescue British hostage David Haines as soon as his location has been pinpointed.

The team,  based a few hours' away in Cyprus, will be whisked into the war-torn country as soon as Britain's intelligence agencies are confident they have located the aid worker kidnapped by ISIS and David Cameron gives the go-ahead for them to go in.

The Director of Special Forces, a British major general, has already briefed the Prime Minister on the likely success of a rescue operation and the dangers to troops being inserted into what is arguably the most dangerous country on earth.

The target: David Haines was kidnapped 18 months ago from a refugee camp where he was working inSyria (pictured at home with daughter Athea Lilith)

It comes after US commandos failed earlier this summer in an attempt to rescue 44-year-old Mr Haines - along with executed American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - as the hostages had been moved by the jihadist fighters before they were able to get to them.

The UK's secret intelligence service MI6, Arabic experts at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham and the SAS are working together in a race against time to establish Mr Haines's location before the terrorists carry out their threat to execute him - and to reach him before he is moved once again.

The first priority is to obtain 'proof of life', and officials will be working on the assumption that Mr Haines is still alive because ISIS has not released a video of his execution.

But intelligence sources believe that the Scottish aid worker, who was kidnapped from a refugee camp in Atmeh, northern Syria 18 months ago, is being moved relatively frequently from one safe house to another.

Race against time: This video grab shows a masked militant threatening to kill Mr Haines. The first priority - before sending in the SAS - is to obtain 'proof of life', and officials will be working on the assumption that Mr Haines is still alive because ISIS has not released a video of his execution

Ready to go: The team, based a few hours' away in Cyprus, will be whisked into the war-torn country by Chinook helicopter as soon as Britain's intelligence agencies are confident they have located the aid worker (stock image of British Royal Marines on a mission in Iraq in 2002)

Firepower: A Special Forces AC-130 gunship may be used for air support during the mission

Hard to track: Mr Haines was abducted in Atmeh, northern Syria, but intelligence sources believe the Scottish aid worker is being moved relatively frequently from one safe house to another

So the first stage in any rescue operation is the 'find' - potentially the most difficult phase - before the hostage's location is 'fixed'.

The SAS will need to know the exact room of the house in the street of the city, town or village, where he is being held.

They will need to know how many terrorists are on guard, their weapons and where the closest reinforcements are based.

With this level of intelligence they can begin to fine tune the plan and start the number crunching process, which will deliver the number of troops and the assets, such as helicopters and combat air support and medical staff, needed to deliver a successful operation.

One of the greatest intelligence gathering assets at the SAS's disposal is the RAF Sentinel R1 spy plane, inside which is a bewildering array of gadgetry supposedly capable of 'seeing inside buildings' and intercepting mobile phone calls.

But the real hardcore information will come from human sources, disaffected members of ISIS ready to deal with either MI6 or the CIA.

It is their information, which is likely to pinpoint the 'fix' - the exact location to within a matter of yards of the hostage's location

Once the 'fix' has been established, the extraction begins. 

Hellfire: They will have air support from Predator drones armed with Hellfire missiles and 500lb bombs, and RAF Tornados based in Cyprus

Last leg: Ground crew prepare a Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado GR4 fighter bomber at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, where Haines will likely be taken back to should the mission prove a success

A squadron-sized SAS force, around 90 to 100 troopers, supported by members of the Special Forces Support Group, will insert into the target area and begin the actual rescue.

They will fly over to Syria - or Iraq if he has been moved across the border - in Black Hawk or heavier duty Chinook helicopters.

This is the crucial phase and where the element of surprise is vital. The operation will be launched at night during the very early hours, before the first muslim prayers of the day.

They will have air support from Predator drones armed with Hellfire missiles and 500lb bombs, and RAF Tornados based in Cyprus.

If Americans are assisting the mission there could also be support from US Air Force AC130 Spectre gunships, which are equipped with a 30mm cannon, a 40mm Bofors auto-cannon, missiles and bombs.

From the moment of 'contact' with the enemy, the SAS may have just minutes to rescue Mr Haines and other hostages. 

The SAS will be equipped with sniper rifles, US Special operations assault rifles, grenade launchers, pistols, stun grenades, silenced weapons, night vision goggles and real-time video satellite-linked to a ground operations room in a safe location - like that used when President Obama watched the US special forces mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.

The SAS will assume that the guards could be wearing suicide vests and under orders to kill the hostages at the first sign of trouble.

The 'find, fix, extraction' mission does not allow for prisoners being taken, so the capture of the militant 'Jihadi John' who executed Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff - and who threatened Mr Haines in the video released this week - will not be a priority.

Not a priority: The 'find, fix, extraction' mission does not allow for prisoners being taken, so the capture of the militant 'Jihadi John', pictured moments before he beheaded U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff will not be a priority

Once the hostages have been freed the exfiltration process begins.

This will involve moving as quickly as possible to a secure and heavily defended rendezvous point, where the SAS and the hostages can be flown out of the target area via helicopter to a safe location, probably Cyprus.

Once back at a British base, Mr Haines would be flown back to the UK, if necessary on a specially equipped medical flight. 

The key to any military operation is simplicity. The more working parts the greater the risk of mistakes. 

The failure of Operation Eagle Claw, the botched US special forces mission to rescue American citizens imprisoned in the US Embassy in Iran in 1980, still lives long in the memory of all special forces units.

Even today the SAS's working mantra is 'if it can go wrong, it will go wrong'. 

Consequently all plans are based around that assumption. 

And while the SAS see it as their duty to 'risk all' in attempting to rescue a British hostage, the Government is likely to be more cautious with senior advisers assessing the 'cost and benefits' of a raid, with the obvious fear being mission failure could see members of the SAS killed or, even worse, captured.

Special Forces chief has already briefed PM on likely success of mission

They need to know where he is, how many guards andhow they're armed

But capture of 'Jihadi John', who beheaded 2 US prisoners, is NOT a priority

@highlight

It'll be second attempt to save him after US commandos failed this summer

But experts say ISIS is moving the Scotsman frequently to avoid detection
