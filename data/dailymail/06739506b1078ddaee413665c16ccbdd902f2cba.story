The foster family of France's most wanted woman tried in vain to stop her marriage to kosher deli killer, Amedy Coulibaly, Mail Online can reveal.

Femme fatale, Hayat Boumeddiene, who has been pictured in a burka with a crossbow, and has now fled to Syria, lived with the Benali family between the ages of eight and 17.

Today they pleaded with her via MailOnline to 'come home'.

Speaking for the first time, her foster brother, who insisted that he was not named, said that the family has done everything possible to block the marriage to the Islamic extremist who killed five people in Paris last week.

He said: 'My dad, from the beginning, didn't agree with it because we didn't have the same culture and we didn't know him - he was a complete stranger.

'We tried everything to avoid this wedding and did everything to convince her not to marry this man.

'Her father did not agree with the wedding either. In the end she insisted so much he ended up accepting. She was very in love I think.'

No one in her substitute family ended up going to the wedding because of her opposition - the only person who went was Boumeddiene's own father.

The Benali's are desperately worried about her safety in Syria.

'We don't know if she's going to make it out there', her foster brother pleaded.

'If we could speak to her we would say, "come home, just come home" – and we'll sort everything else out.'

After meeting Coulibaly, her first boyfriend, aged 18 and marrying him two years later, Boumeddiene cut off contact and no longer visited her foster parents. 

The last time anyone in the family heard from her was in October when her Mr and Mrs Benali had returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca and she rang to congratulate them. She had also been to on a trip to Islam's holiest city, she told them.

The 26-year-old originally came to live with the family, who had once been neighbours with her own, because her father - a delivery driver - couldn't take care of his eight children after the death of Boumeddiene's mother.

'Her father couldn't cope. Her brother was only two years old when their mother died. Their dad left the kids at home when he was working.'

'She went to live in care homes and it didn't go well. She was naughty so they didn't want her any more.'

The kind-hearted family broke their silence about Boumesdiene's troubled upbringing as it emerged that Coulibaly had been severely affected as a teen, by witnessing the death of a 19-year-old schoolmate at the hands of police.

Coulibaly appeared to suffer profound guilt and anger after his classmate Ali Rezgui was shot in the back five times as the friends tried to flee police on the grim estate, the dead boy's lawyer told Mail Online today.

While also troubled, Boumeddienne temporarily found the stability she craved at the Benali family home. The Algerian couple were happy to take her in even though they had eight children of their own to bring up. 'For us it's just being human and she needed help', her foster brother explained.

The youngster was not religious when she lived with the family, they explained. She did not pray and the only religious practice she followed was the Ramadan fast.

Her foster sibling said: 'She loved nature and the countryside and was very generous. If she had a bit of money she would buy us presents like clothes.' 

He added: 'But she didn't have many friends. She did not go out a lot.'

The Islamist bride eventually left the family home at 17 after she got a job as a cashier and got her own apartment.

The Benali family condemned last weeks attacks as 'horrific' and, although they didn't believe Boumeddiene was involved, they said they were 'disappointed' that she had gone to Syria 'as it showed how much she had changed'.

Her foster brother said that the Benali family were closer to her than her real family and could not believe she had anything to do with the attacks last week: 'We were in shock when we saw her on TV - we were really upset.'

Brief stay: For two nights in Istanbul, Boumeddiene, who has been described as armed and dangerous, slept in room 102 – where a picture of the Eiffel Tower hangs above the bed

No-frills: The jihadi widow checked into Bade Otel in Kadikoy, on the Asian side of the city, on January 2 after flying into Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport

Basic: The room came with a shabby bathroom, a TV, a double and single bed - and a picture of the Eiffel Tower on the wall

'We couldn't believe it. We consider her our daughter and sister. We don't understand because when she was young, she worked hard, she had good grades.

'She really wanted to succeed in life that's the only thing that counted for her. '

At around the same age, Coulibaly was also on a path to success and was 'well integrated' lawyer, Pierre Mairat said today.

Mr Mairat who represented the family of teen Ali Rezgui who was killed by police said: 'Coulibaly was well integrated. He was completely French. He was close to finishing high school and doing well.'

But aged 18, he made a fatal error taking part with four others in the attempted theft of several motorbikes from the garage of an apartment block.

When police arrived his friend fled and was shot in the back five times by a police officer who was still an intern.

The lawyer said he believed the event played 'a huge part' in his personal history and was a very important element in the person he became later.

He said: 'When he saw his best friend being killed by police officer he reacted with various emotions, firstly guilt because he knew he did something wrong. 

'The second feeling was that of injustice because the police reaction was disproportionate and illegitimate and the third is the feeling of discrimination towards himself and young people like him from two major institutions, the police that killed his friend illegitimately and the justice system that didn't do their job.'
