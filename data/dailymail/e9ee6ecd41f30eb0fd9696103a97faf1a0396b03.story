An Ohio man pleaded not guilty on Thursday in the rape and strangulation of a nine-year-old girl whose body was found in a trash bin at the trailer park where they were neighbors.

One of Jerrod Metsker's court-appointed attorneys entered the pleas for him in Wayne County court.

Metsker, wearing a red jail outfit with his wrists handcuffed, appeared via video and did not speak during the brief hearing.

Through his court-appointed attorney Larry Whitney, left, Metsker pleaded not guilty in the rape and strangulation of nine-year-old Reann Murphy who was found dead in a trash bin at the trailer park where they were neighbors

A grand jury had indicted the 24-year-old Metsker on charges of aggravated murder, kidnapping and rape. He is being held on $1 million bond.

Authorities previously said the death penalty would be available as punishment if Metsker is convicted of murder.

Metsker was the last person seen with nine-year-old Reann Murphy at their trailer park in Smithville, southwest of Akron, authorities said.

A caller identifying himself as Metsker reported Reann missing in a 911 call.

Her body was found December 15 after a frantic search by neighbors and law enforcement. Metsker was arrested later that day.

The prosecutor said she was likely killed at Metsker's mobile home between 5.30pm and 7.30pm on December 14.

On that day, the girl had been at home with her mother's live-in boyfriend while her mother was at work, authorities said.

Reann went outside to play in the snow and was with several other children in the trailer park's courtyard, but the others went home, leaving Metsker alone with her.

Her father, Richard Murphy, said on Thursday that he was supposed to have Reann at his house in Creston that weekend but was not able to reach her mother for the exchange. He said he last saw her the day after Thanksgiving.

Investigators with the Wayne County sheriff's office earlier described Metsker as a family friend and neighbor.

Capt. Douglas Hunter said Metsker has a 'diminished mental capacity,' but didn't release information about a specific diagnosis.

A judge was assigned to the case, but it wasn't clear when the next hearing would be scheduled.

Relatives
 said Reann lived with her mother but also spent time with her father 
and his family. They said she loved to play outside and described her as
 a tomboy.

'She was a little firecracker, always ready to wrestle
 and play,' her cousin Paula Watts said. 'She wasn't into girlie stuff. 
Last Christmas, she said she wanted some girlie stuff. I don't know if 
she ever wore the makeup we got her.'

Reann's heartbroken father, Richard Murphy said: 'She's
 the best thing that ever happened to me ... this is the hardest thing 
I've ever been through in my life. She saved my life. I 
wish I could trade her places.'

He grappled with the appropriate outcome for her killer, saying that while he wanted to see justice it still would not bring the relief he needed.

‘I want the worst for the guy, but it’s still not going to bring back my daughter,’ he told Fox8.

‘She was a wonderful kid. I mean she was playful. She’d never - all she did was love people.’
