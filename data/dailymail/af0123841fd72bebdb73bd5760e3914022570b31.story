George Groves is writing a boxing sitcom, which he says is a mix of The Inbetweeners and Entourage. As a fan of storytelling, he believes his own career is following a far darker path but insists it will have a happy ending.

Two successive defeats by arch-rival Carl Froch have left Groves at a critical point in his journey and, with a world title eliminator looming next Saturday, he knows a third loss would be fatal for his career.

‘If it was Lord of the Rings, we are still only one book in,’ he says. ‘It’s been a half-decent read but it gets better — a lot better — it may get a bit darker but we’re on our way and there are plenty more chapters to put together. I don’t quite know what is going to happen yet but we’re not even halfway through the series.’

George Groves returns to the ring this months as he prepares to take on Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse 

The next chapter will see Groves return to Wembley, albeit at the Arena rather than the stadium which was the scene of his brutal knockout by Froch in the biggest fight in British boxing history, to challenge Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse for his European title.

‘Losing this fight is a much more frightening prospect than losing to Carl Froch,’ says Groves, 26. ‘This is a must-win fight. The second Froch fight in many ways was an event bigger than boxing, it created such an atmosphere, such hype, it captured the public’s imagination and everyone seemed to be interested. But in the bigger scheme of things, this is the biggest fight of my life.’

Win on Saturday and Groves would be the mandatory challenger for the WBC super-middleweight title and back on course possibly to end 2014 as a world champion. But Groves is well aware that fairy-tales rarely happen.

Carl Froch lands a punch on Groves in the biggest fight in British boxing history during their bout in May

Groves was brutally knocked out in the eight round of a second successive defeat to arch-rival Carl Froch

His first world-title shot last November ended in a controversial ninth-round stoppage, while the May rematch with Froch finished with him sprawled on the canvas in front of 77,000 people and millions more across the globe.

‘It was a strange feeling, numbing — and not just literally,’ he says. ‘You prepare mentally, physically and emotionally for a fight and it was the first time I’ve really experienced it when will and tenacity and grit and hunger aren’t enough.

‘My first thought was that I had let the whole team down and let my family down. We had worked so hard for that opportunity — it was the perfect time for me to arrive — I know other opportunities will come but that was the one I wanted.

The Londoner has much to contemplate as he looks to rebuild his boxing reputation on a return to the ring

‘Losing was devastating and the first time I saw Kalle [Sauerland, his promoter] I said sorry. But he said all the right things and told me to go away, have a break and not think about boxing. The next day my wife and me flew to Dubai but I could tell Kalle was working on a comeback fight. He didn’t want to bother me but I’m there sending him texts about who and when I think I should be boxing next.

‘I just wanted to get stuck into training again as soon as possible. The Froch fight wasn’t a physically brutal fight where you needed months to recover from injuries or cuts — it was probably the least aching fight I’ve ever had — and I was literally back in the gym a week later.

‘It was harder to recover mentally and emotionally. I was expecting to crash and start thinking I needed a break or start feeling sorry for myself. But as time went on I realised that is not really who I am. I got knocked out, it happens but that doesn’t mean I need to start doubting myself or feeling sorry for myself.

‘It has not necessarily been about going back to the drawing board and changing myself too much as a fighter. It’s about becoming more emotionally strong.

‘I’m always going to be sad about losing and I’ll never get over that. But I don’t want to. I’m not a person who is content in life — I always want to be better and achieve more and I’m certainly more determined now.’

Groves appears relaxed but focused as he trains ahead of his European title fight with Christopher Rebrasse 

Brash and abrasive in the build-up to both fights with Froch, Groves is much quieter in person and at times is barely audible as trains rattle above his west London gym. He remains as confident as ever though.

‘If someone said: “Do you want to fight Carl Froch next month” I’d say: “100 per cent” and I’d tell everyone I’d knock him out and believe it,’ said Groves. ‘I trust in my abilities, my work ethic and in my ambition to improve and become the most complete fighter I can be.

‘I still feel I will be considered a great fighter one day, that’s the goal and that hasn’t changed off the back of two losses. I have a deep, ignorant conviction that I’m a great fighter and nobody has yet been able to prove to me that isn’t the case.’

Asked where this confidence and resilience stems from, Groves cites the support of wife Sophie, who interrupts the interview to ensure Groves eats his avocado and salmon salad lunch, and parents Yvonne and Donny. It is a close-knit family and Groves admits the defeats have been hard for his loved ones.

‘I know they were devastated and it must have been tough especially for my dad — he re-decorated the gym before I got back from Dubai because he wanted it to be like a fresh start, which was sweet.

The 26-year-old lands a punch onto Froch during their first bout which was controversially stopped

Groves was stopped in the ninth round in his first fight with Froch, prompting immediate calls for a rematch 

‘My parents are not necessarily confident people. If you go on holiday with them they’re not the ones up on stage doing karaoke or anything like that, but at the same time they’ve always encouraged me to be the best I can be. 

'They’ve given me loads of love and support and that obviously develops confidence.Anything I know I’m good at, I’m happy to stand in front of a crowd and show off. Ask me to sing or dance and I’d start sweating but, when it comes to boxing, I know what I’m doing.’

Hanging in his gym is a symbol of that: the Rubik’s Cube he pulled out during the build-up to the second Froch fight. It was a moment that simultaneously demonstrated Groves’ ability to sell a fight and play mind games with an opponent.

‘All that was good fun but it’s nice to have a break from it. I feel I know how to tell a story and take people on a journey and that is what you want in boxing. Floyd Mayweather is very good at it, there’s always some sort of controversy ahead of his fights and that is what keeps him interesting and relevant. When my time comes — when I win the WBC title and maybe challenge for a unification fight — I’ll embrace it.’

Groves has always enjoyed mind games and is always able to sell a fight  as this Rubik's cube stunt shows

Groves’ antics outside the ring saw him cast as an arrogant upstart but two heroic performances won much admiration and respect.

‘I’m a much more high-profile boxer now — people are excited about me and want to come see me box. But the flipside is would I trade all that for two wins and a world title? Of course. You want to become a world champion. But you also want to entertain and fight for the fans — so if I’m in more big fights that is just as exciting to me.’

And Groves has not given up on a third instalment with Froch next year. He said: ‘If I had knocked him out I’d have been satisfied with that but he’s not satisfied because he knows he was getting beaten up until that point. Take nothing away from Carl Froch, he found the target with the best punch of his career, but maybe there’s a part of him that thinks: “I wish it wasn’t so lucky”.

‘At various times since the last fight he has had swipes at me, the latest one being that I wasn’t the fighter he was and he was the superstar, but his fight hasn’t been announced yet. He’s rolling around on TV in tights and we’ll see how well he does when his tickets go on sale. We’re not friends, he doesn’t like me. I feel there is a possibility a third fight could happen.’

Whether Groves gets the chance remains to be seen. For now, he must make sure the next chapter of his story is a happy one.
