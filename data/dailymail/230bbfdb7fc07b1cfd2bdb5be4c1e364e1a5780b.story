Britain's privatised water firms have ‘abused’ loopholes in the law to dodge more than £1billion in tax since the election.

A dossier of shame reveals nine water companies, seven of which are foreign owned, have racked up operating profits totalling £10billion since 2010 but paid just £541million in tax.

This equates to a tax rate of just 5.3 per cent. Corporation tax on operating profit is normally 23 per cent.

Down the drain: The Treasury has missed out on £1billion i tax from utility firms, it has been claimed

At the same time, two of the country’s
 biggest energy firms, also foreign-owned, made combined profits of 
£1.7billion but paid no tax at all.

Meanwhile soaring utility bills have 
left millions feeling the pinch. Average water bills have gone up by 
14.5 per cent, while electricity bills have soared by 24.8 per cent and 
gas bills by 33.9 per cent.

The average family has seen its annual utility bills rise by £384.

The revelations are embarrassing for David Cameron who has pledged to clamp down on tax avoidance by multinationals.

The details were revealed to the 
Commons by Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, a tax lawyer, who called on 
ministers to force water and power firms to cut their bills if they 
continued to avoid paying tax.

There is no suggestion that the firms 
involved have broken the law, and they all deny wrongdoing. But Mr 
Elphicke said the scale of the tax avoidance was staggering.

‘Foreign-owned utility companies, 
particularly in the water industry, have been engaging in tax schemes 
using debt interest to avoid tax, which on my calculation over the last 
three years indicates that the Exchequer has lost £1billion,’ he said.

He went on: ‘They should either be subject to a windfall tax or reduce customers’ bills.’

Mr Elphicke told MPs that the firms 
were ‘abusing’ generous tax reliefs that allow companies to offset debt 
interest payments against tax. He said firms were borrowing huge sums 
off subsidiaries and sister companies, sometimes in tax havens, and then
 offsetting the interest payments against tax.

He singled out Yorkshire Water as an 
‘especially egregious’ example, saying the giant, which is owned by an 
international consortium, had generated £990million in operating profits
 over the last three years, yet managed to bank a net tax credit worth 
£46.2million.

Southern Water, which is also owned by
 an international consortium, paid net tax of £45.9million on profits 
totalling £767million in the last few years. Foreign-owned Anglian Water
 generated operating profits of £1.4billion over the period, but paid 
tax of just under £125million.

Mr Elphicke accused energy firms of 
exploiting similar practices. He said EDF, which is owned by the French 
government, made £268.4million in interest payments to group companies, 
potentially avoiding £70million in tax. And German-owned Npower made 
£358million in interest payments, saving a potential £93million in tax.

Mr Elphicke called for tax relief to be removed from interest payments to group companies to help curb the abuse.

Feeling the pinch: Average water bills have gone up by 14.5 per cent, while electricity bills have soared by 24.8 per cent and gas bills by 33.9 per cent, meaning the average family's utility costs are up £384

The nine water firms examined by Mr Elphicke were:

  The nine firms represent most of the major water companies, although a large number of small firms take the total for England and Wales to 27.

Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, 
said lax UK rules meant avoiding tax was ‘as easy as taking candy from a
 baby’ for multinationals.

‘There are several serious problems with the 
system which leads it wide open to abuse,’ he said.

Earlier this month it emerged that 
Australian-owned Thames Water paid no tax last year despite racking up 
pre-tax profits of £145million.

Treasury Minister David Gauke insisted 
ministers were making progress in tackling tax avoidance.

He said HM Revenue and Customs had 
secured £8billion of additional revenues from large companies through 
tax compliance work in 2012/13 and over £23billion over three years.

The companies involved insisted they 
had done nothing wrong. Most said they had to borrow large sums in order
 to fund investment in infrastructure in the UK.

Npower said it ‘has not, and will not,
 engage in tax avoidance’ and said its corporation tax bill was low 
because it made losses in its retail business and ‘invested billions 
into the UK’.

Southern Water said water companies 
‘invest significant amounts in maintaining and improving infrastructure’
 and this is taken into account when calculating the tax payments.

An EDF spokesman said it pays the corporation tax due each year and makes a significant contribution to the UK economy.

An Anglian Water spokesman said it 
made a ‘huge contribution’ to the economy and pays more than £150million
 a year directly and indirectly in different taxes. ‘Our Corporation Tax
 bill is reduced by specific government incentives and deferred not 
avoided.’

Yorkshire Water could not be contacted for comment.
