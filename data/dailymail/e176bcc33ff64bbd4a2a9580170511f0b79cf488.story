The sister of the Indian diplomat accused keeping her maid a ‘virtual slave’ has hit out against critics’ claims that her sibling is a ‘rich elite poster girl of privilege.’

In an impassioned defence of her sister Devyani, 39, Sharmistha Khobragade has revealed: ‘She is receiving hate mails from unknown random people accusing her of ‘using slave labor’ and being a rich elite poster child of privilege.’

She said: ‘More than the public 
humiliation she has been through, these accusations which attack the 
very core of her value system are causing her deep pain and anguish.’

Viified as a 'rich elite poster child of privelege' but diplomat Devyani Khobragade is 'just another working mother' according to her sister Sharmistha

The Indian government reacted with outrage over the treatment of its Deputy Consul in New York who was arrested on charges of visa fraud, strip-searched and held in a cell with sex workers and drug addicts before posting $250,000 bail.

But according to her sister: ‘The hate mail and the unfair accusations are far more likely to break Devyani’s spirit than anything else.’

Impassioned Defence: Dr Khobragade's sister Sharmistha has refuted claims that her sister is a 'poster child for privelege'

Sharmistha broke her silence in a lengthy Facebook posting in which she rebutted the allegations made by Dr Khobragade’s maid, Sangeeta Richard.

She hit back at the presentation of her sister as ‘a rich elite poster child of privilege, used to having servants at her beck and call, an exploiter and a hypocrite for talking about women’s rights.’

But Dr Khobragade’s background is certainly one of considerable comfort and academic ambition.

Born and brought up in Mumbai, her father, Uttam is former magistrate and retired IAS officer and her uncle, Dr Ajay M Gondane is Indian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea. 

She studied medicine and qualified from the Seth GS Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai but abandoned it to enter the Indian Foreign Service in 1999.

She is proficient in English, Hindi, German and her mother tongue, Marathi. 

But it was neither family precedent nor her own undoubted abilities that secured Dr Khobragade her place in the IFS. Instead it was the fact that she is a Dalit – or Untouchable – which allowed her entrance to the IFS on the India’s quota system for ‘Schedule Castes', according to surprising reports in India.

A total of 7.5 per cent of all jobs in the IFS must go to members of Scheduled Castes. The system was established with the aim of helping social mobility in an otherwise rigid culture of cast discrimination.

Dr Khobragade's treatment was raised in India's parliament, the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday when Bahiyan Samaj Party leader, Mayawati accused central government of 'reacting late' because of the diplomat's low caste.

Raised in a culture where inequity is keenly felt and plainly seen, Dr Khobragade’s campaigning on issues of equality is, according to her family, neither posturing nor hypocritical but, instead, profoundly personal.

Allegations of keeping her maid a 'virtual slave' have struck to the very core of Dr Khobragade's value system

Had she been used to ‘having servants at her beck and call,’ her sister claimed: ‘Devyani would have taken servants each time she was posted abroad.

‘But she did not take a servant when she was unmarried and without children. The actual fact is that Devyani is happiest when she does not have servants around.’

Today, as a working mother to two daughters, now 3 and 6, ‘this is not an option for her.’

Sharmistha said: ‘I am concerned with whether she (Devyani) has mistreated, defrauded or exploited another human being in any way. The answer to this is a resounding, “no.”’

She claimed that Richard was paid ‘whatever Devyani had promised her.’ She explained: ‘A sum of Rs30,000 was paid into Sangeeta’s husband’s bank account in India monthly. In addition to this, according to the $9/hour contract, Devyani paid Sangeeta several hundred dollars each month in New York, in cash at her request.’

According to Sharmistha: ‘Sangeeta had two large comfortable rooms to herself in a well-appointed apartment with all modern facilities and a separate entrance.’

She ate the same food as the family, she had ‘complete discretion in managing the house’ and was ‘allowed to pace her work as she wished.’

In a glowing account of Richard’s working conditions she added: ‘She was allowed to come and go as she pleased, having the house keys, metro pass and the option to take taxis at Devyani’s expense.’

She added: ‘We was provided with a mobile phone, had bought an iPad which she often used for Facebook and could communicate with whomever she wished whenever she wished, in India or New York.’

'The hate mail and accusations are far more likely to break Devyani's spirit than anything else,'                         -Sharmistha Khobragade

According to Sharmistha, Richard was welcomed as a member of the family and forged a close bond with the girls for whom she largely cared.

In return she left ‘without any warning or notice,’ she said, and ‘without even leaving a good-bye not for the girls who were so fond of her.’

She claimed that Dr Khobragade offered to pay for Richard’s flight back to India if she was unhappy with her role and that when ‘she faced Devyani across a negotiating table,’ Richard told her: ‘I will not go back. Why will I go back? I know that if I go back I will never be able to come back to the US.‘So who exploited whom? Who used whom?’

By her own admission Sharmistha did not witness any of the scenes she so keenly described. But, she said: ‘I know most of this from Devyani and from my father who did visit her in the November 2012- June 2013 period.’

Dr Khobragade’s brother, Shashank, posted his own comment describing the ‘US behaviour as arrogant and inhuman.’

Speaking to MailOnline Dr Khobragade’s father, Uttam, revealed that he planned to travel to New York to be with his daughter.

Describing the sequence of events as ‘shocking’ he said: ‘She’s a brave girl. She has not done anything wrong. I myself was a magistrate for seven years. She has not done anything that warrants her arrest.’

And though Sharmistha spoke of her sister’s sense of personal betrayal, her father insisted: ‘The whole of India feels that it is not an attack on Devyani, it is an attack on Indian sovereignty.’
