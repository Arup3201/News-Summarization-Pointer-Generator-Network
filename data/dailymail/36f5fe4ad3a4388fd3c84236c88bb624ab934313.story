New installation: The Tate Modern (pictured) in London has purchased a cluster of Scottish sheep droppings strung across wire for £16,000

A cluster of Scottish sheep droppings strung across wire is one of the art works among a collection the Tate Modern purchased for more than £200,000 from a Mexican artist.

The gallery bought the £16,000 installation entitled ‘S**t Models ‘ along with 17 other works by artist Abraham Cruzvillegas.

The taxpayer funded gallery in London describes the 2008 creation on its website as ‘sheep excrement, dung, plaster, cardboard, steel and wood’.

Mr Cruzvillega admitted he used discarded items he found on the street or in fields for his works when he spent six months in Scotland creating his exhibition; Autoconstruction.

The 45-year-old told a contemporary art magazine that he used ‘wool, sheep shit, chicken wire, discarded furniture, cardboard, stones, grass and my own hair’ to make the installations.

‘They are unplanned assemblages, made to test new dialogues between odd and contradictory objects and prime matter,’ the artist explained.

S**t Models appears to be made from a discarded bird table on top of which upright metal wires have been placed with lumps of sheep excrement hung on top.

His collection also includes ‘Blind in Self Portrait’ which consists of scores of scraps of paper he came by in Scotland, such as leaflets, ferry tickets and receipts which he painted red.

According to a report, the cost of the installations was revealed in a document showing all the artworks bought by the Tate, which is Britain’s national gallery, in the past year.

Expensive purchases: The Tate, which is run by Sir Nicolas Serota (pictured), also spent £2,100 from a Government grant to buy a piece from artist Ed Herring which consisted of an old plastic card-index file

Mr Cruzvillegas’s work was bought with funds given to the Tate, which with almost 5million visitors a year is the most visited modern art gallery in the world, by wealthy benefactors.

A further £229,000 was spent on a piece by Cuban Felix Gonzalez-Torres which featured two light bulbs, light sockets and cable.

The Tate, which is run by Sir Nicolas Serota, also spent £2,100 from a Government grant to buy a piece from artist Ed Herring which consisted of an old plastic card-index file.

Charles Thomson, of Stuckists, which promotes traditional art, told the Sunday Express: ‘If this stuff was auctioned on eBay it would sell for a fiver.

‘The Tate’s meant to be the national collection of modern art. It’s more like the national junk shop.’

However, The Tate defended its decisions saying: ‘We are pleased to acquire works by these artists using funds raised by Tate.’

Mr Cruzvillegas’s collection is currently on loan to the Haus der Kunst gallery in Munich, Germany.
