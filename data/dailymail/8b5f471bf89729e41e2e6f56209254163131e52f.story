Tom Cruise's lawyer has revealed the Hollywood's star's secret pain at being kept apart from his daughter after Katie Holmes sensationally dumped her husband.

Cruise's lawyer, Bert Fields, said the actor was 'saddened and shocked' at being blindsided by the actress' decision to divorce him after five years of marriage and devastated he is being kept apart from his six-year-old daughter.

The 50-year-old is currently filming his new sci-fi movie Oblivion in California but has spoken out through Fields, saying he plans to see Suri, who is with her mother in New York, 'very soon'.

Separate lives: Tom Cruise, pictured on set of Oblivion in California today, is 'still shocked' by the divorce while Katie Holmes, pictured out last night, seems to be happily moving on from the marriage 

The father and daughter have been apart for almost a month but according to reports have been speaking regularly on the phone.

Fields told RadarOnline: 'Tom will be seeing Suri very soon, I don't know exactly when that will be, and I couldn't tell you, but I do know it will be very soon.

'Tom loves his Suri very, very much, as he does his other two children. Tom is a family man, and dedicated to his children. They are the center of his world.'

'Tom is obviously relieved that the settlement was reached, but is still sad, obviously.'

Katie has sole custody of Suri as part of the settlement agreement, but the actor will have substantial visitation rights.

The former Dawson's Creek star appears to be swiftly moving on from her marriage and last night headed out for dinner with a friend in New York wearing sexy leather trousers and a white blazer.

The 33-year-old had earlier enjoyed a trip to the Central Park Zoo with her daughter and mother Kathleen.

Katie is understood to be desperate to distance her daughter from Scientology, the controversial religion which Tom follows.

She appears to have formally confirmed her return to Catholicism by signing up as a member of the congregation of the Church of St. Francis Xavier, which is located on 16th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.
