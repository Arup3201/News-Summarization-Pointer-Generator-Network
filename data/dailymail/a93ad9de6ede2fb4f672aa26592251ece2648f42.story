The Gunners boss also hinted that Walcott would be drafted back into his staring XI sooner rather than later.

'Once he’s back in full training it can be very quick. He has a good basis, which is what he’s working on now. ' said the Frenchman.

Meanwhile, Walcott believes he and new signing Alexis Sanchez can form a potent partnership that will strike fear into opposition defences next season.

'Sanchez is a world class player and I
 enjoyed watching him play for Barcelona and for Chile at the World 
Cup,' Walcott told Arsenal Player.

'He's still very young as well and he is going to show so much pace and power, which we lacked a bit last year.

'With me and him on the flanks, a lot of teams won't be looking forward to playing Arsenal this year.
