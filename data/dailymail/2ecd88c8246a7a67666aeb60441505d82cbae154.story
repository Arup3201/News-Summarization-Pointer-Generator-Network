An orangutan which has spent its entire 29-year life in zoos could be freed within days after judges said it has the same rights as a person.

Experts say the landmark ruling over Sandra, who was born in Germany and has lived in Buenos Aires Zoo for 20 years, could open the floodgates to thousands of similar cases across Argentina.

Animal rights campaigners won Sandra's freedom by filing a habeas corpus petition - a document more often used to challenge the legality of holding prisoners - in the capital's courts last year.

They argued Sandra should not be treated as an 'object' under the law but instead as a 'non-human person', because of her intelligence and complex way of thinking.

A judge rejected the petition, but the campaigners appealed and won in Argentina's Criminal Appeals Court at the end of last week, according to national newspaper La Nación.

Paul Buompadre, who arranged the case as part of Argentina's Association of Professional Lawyers for Animal Rights (Afada), told the newspaper: 'This opens the way not only for other Great Apes, but also for other sentient beings which are unfairly and arbitrarily deprived of their liberty in zoos, circuses, water parks and scientific laboratories.' 

The zoo has two weeks to seek an appeal in Argentina's Supreme Court before the ape is moved to a sanctuary, reportedly in Brazil.

A spokesman for the Jardín Zoológico de Buenos Aires declined to comment to the Reuters news agency.

Its head of biology Adrian Sestelo, however, accused the campaigners of unfairly comparing the animal to a human.

He told La Nación: 'When you don't know the biology of a species, to 
unjustifiably claim it suffers abuse, is stressed or depressed,
is to make one of man's most common mistakes, which is to
humanise animal behaviour.'

With a name meaning 'forest man', orangutans are often cited alongside chimpanzees and bonobos as humankind's closest genetic relatives, sharing around 97 per cent of our DNA.

Native to Malaysia and Sumatra, the red-haired animals are severely endangered with numbers dropping from 230,000 a century ago to fewer than 50,000 today.

Of those, 41,000 are Bornean orangutans and just 7,500 are Sumatran orangutans, which the World Wildlife Fund says are critically endangered.

The ruling has come just days after U.S. campaigners failed in an almost identical bid to gain human-like rights for a chimpanzee.

The Nonhuman Rights Project vowed to push its case further after a New York state appeals court ruled Tommy, a privately-owned chimp, could not be described as a 'legal person'.

The campaign group's president Steven Wise said: 'We intend to bring the Argentine case to the attention of the New York appellate courts immediately as we believe it will assist the courts in reaching a similar conclusion for our chimpanzee plaintiffs.' 

Executive director Natalie Prosin previously told MailOnline: 'Under U.S. law animals count as things, not people. There are animal protection laws but that's not the same as giving rights to animals. At the moment they're just the same as a table or a chair.  

'The last time we saw him he was in a cage in a shed on a trailer park. He basically lives in solitary confinement.'
