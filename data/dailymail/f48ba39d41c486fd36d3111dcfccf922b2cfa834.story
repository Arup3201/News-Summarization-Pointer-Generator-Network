Shooter: Police have identified Michelet Polynice, 33, seen from a previous arrest, as the gunman who allegedly shot three women early Thursday morning at two Orlando hotels

Two women are dead and a third in critical condition after a crazed gunman, allegedly seeking revenge on his ex-girlfriend for taking out a restraining order, launched shooting attacks in two hotels in Orlando.

Police in Central Florida say Michelet Polynice, 33, fatally shot himself after a short pursuit by police that ended dramatically on Thursday morning with the suspect's car hitting a tree and catching fire.

Just before 8am Polynice allegedly walked into a Quality Suites hotel off International Drive, a major tourist hub, and waved his gun around before firing a single shot in the air and taking his first two victims.

The two clerks at that hotel, both 
aged 28, were apparently killed immediately after suffering wounds to their heads and upper bodies.

One of the women who died was Carlene Pierre, the gunman's ex-girlfriend and mother of his child, who recently took a restraining order out against him.

The other, Vanessa Gonzalez-Orellanes, did not known Polynice and was just a co-worker of Ms Pierre.

State records show Polynice may have been known by police, having served 
time in prison between 2004 and 2005 for aggravated stalking, felony 
battery and battery by detainee.

Police say the shootings follow a 
domestic violence injunction served against Polynice on Wednesday 
evening over an incident that happened on September 11.

Victims: Carlene Pierre, left, was killed and her friend Jean Guerline, right, injured in the deadly rampage

Tragic ending: The early morning shooting ended tragically before the alleged gunman shot himself in the head and crashed his white Camry into this tree

'There had been an altercation at the
 place of work, the hotel where she was working, where apparently he 
tried to run her over with a vehicle,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'Very likely, he 
could have been facing arrest soon in that case.'

'It does stem from a relationship that went bad,' Demings said according to FOX35. 'A child 
was involved, but the child has been located and is in good  health.'

Both women were taken to Dr Phillips Hospital where they were pronounced dead, Local 6 reports.

Traveling 2.5 miles down the road to the Westgate Resort, the suspect located his third victim, 31-year-old housekeeper Jean Guerline, who was arriving to start her work day.

Guerline was apparently targeted because she was best friends with Carlene Pierre.

Using caution: Police are seen carefully approaching the white Camry after a deputy reported seeing its driver pull out a gun and raise it to his temple before firing what he said were multiple shots

Motive: Only one of the victims have been named with police saying the issue stemmed from a domestic dispute involving a restraining order filed on Wednesday

Pierre's sister, Judith Delchere, spoke of her anger that authorities had failed to save the domestic violence victim even though she had faced repeated death threats.

'We had faith in the system,' she said. 'We were like, the system will protect the woman, because that's what they always say.'

Pierre told police at the time of obtaining an injunction that she feared she could be die at the hands of her estranged lover, according to court documents.

'He told me the only way he is going to leave me alone is by killing me,' she said. 'I am very afraid for my life.'

Chase: The man was spotted by police driving several miles from the second hotel where he allegedly took his third victim

Police officer Mark Waltrip told the Orlando Sentinel Guerline was shot while outside the hotelâ€™s security gate.

She later identified Polynice to 
police saying he was a former Westgate employee himself and confirmed that he was her best 
friend's ex-boyfriend.

Guerline underwent surgery at the Orlando Regional Medical Center this morning.

Fleeing the scene in a white Camry, 
police say the suspect was later spotted around 9.34am before crashing 
into a tree, setting it on fire with him still inside.

Shooting: Police say the suspect entered this Quality Suites hotel just before 8am and fired shots at his first two victims

Second trip: Minutes after the first shooting the gunman travelled to the West Gate Resort, pictured, shooting a third woman as she was beginning to start her work day

Demings told FOX that the suspect 'put something to his right temple' before a deputy reported seeing several flashes.

He said the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that in addition to Polynice's string of previous charges, court records show a woman claims he previously threatened to kill her after she gave birth to his baby.

In 2010 she sought an injunction against him claiming he nearly made her crash her car after running into her.

In January that same year he allegedly also spat on her while she was in a hospital. The woman claimed that he promised he would kill her while making police believe she died over birth complications.
