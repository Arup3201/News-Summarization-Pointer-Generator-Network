Smiling children enjoy fairground rides and a small boy eagerly waves at the camera while a candy-coloured big wheel turns in the distance.

The footage could show scenes from any amusement park, anywhere in the world, yet it is a propaganda video designed to show the 'lighter' side of living under the bloodthirsty Islamic State caliphate.

Shot in Dijla City, a fairground just north of the Iraqi city Mosul, children and adults describe life under ISIS control.

Unsurprisingly, they are all very complimentary.

Propaganda: Smiling children enjoy fairground rides at Dijla City in Islamic State's most recent propaganda video

The ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like under the Islamic State caliphate

The scenes could be from any park, anywhere in the world, but these children live under the control of ISIS

The video, entitled 'Citizens’ Days Out in the Shadow of the Islamic State' and published today, is an attempt to depict an idealised version of everyday life under the caliphate.

Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, analysed the footage.  

'In the video, we see men and children playing in Dijla City theme park, which is located just on the outside of Mosul in northern Iraq,' Mr Winter said.

'While it may seem a strange addition to IS’s propaganda repertoire, is nothing unusual. 

'Just as they do in many other videos like this, the propagandists are peddling the idea that there has been a total reversal of the status quo for Sunni Muslims in IS-held territory. 

'They are trying to promote the idea that the IS caliphate is a true utopia, where Sunni children are free to play safely, free from persecution and injustice. 

'Safe to say, this is a heavily idealised version of events.'

All the fun of the ISIS: Shot in Dijla City, a fairground just north of the Iraqi city Mosul, children and adults what life is like under ISIS control

The ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like.

He replies: 'It is a life that is comfortable and God has willed it that it is like this in the Islamic State, which will remain by the permission of God.'

Another reveals it is 'very good' and he is 'at ease'.

A man, who carries a young girl in his arms, tells the interviewer: 'I mean, this situation is what God prefers, he is great, it is preferred by God the Almighty, all is good here, there is security that is enviable. 

'Would we want more? There is a huge difference now, it is better than before.'

Smiles: Youngsters are interviewed in the video and it is no surprise they are complimentary of bloodthirsty ISIS

The footage, which shows no women, couldn't be more different to chilling new images of a sword-wielding ISIS executioner publicly beheading three men accused of homosexuality and blasphemy, also in northern Iraq.

The jihadist group, which controls swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria, has carried out hundreds of barbaric executions as it has imposed its brutal version of Islamic law, many of which are photographed or videotaped. 

The Sharia code of conduct is enforced in areas under its control ranging from 80 lashes for drinking alcohol and losing a hand for theft, to death for committing blasphemy.
