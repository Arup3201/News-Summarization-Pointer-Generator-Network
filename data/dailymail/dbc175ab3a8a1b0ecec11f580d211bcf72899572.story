For 18 years Linda Arnaud was forced to relocate through six states as a crazed stalker tracked her every move.

Each time she moved her life and switched jobs, homes and even states the terrified yoga instructor prayed it would be her last relocation.

And each and very time twisted stalker Moses Shepard would hunt her down.

Safe at last: Linda Arnaud, 45, was stalked by Queens native Moses Shepard for 18 years

Shepard's reign of terror began after he enjoyed a stroll through Central Park with the former elementary school teacher.

They knew each other through shared membership of a running club, but after the walk in the park the Upper East Side New Yorker decided she did not want to take the friendship any further.

It was then that the trouble began as the then Queens resident wouldn't take no for an answer and began a spiralling hate campaign that would last almost half his victim's lifetime.

Linda, now 45, said: 'He showed up at my place of work. He showed up at my school, at my apartment - he showed up on the subway platform. He stalked me all over New York City.

'I was terrified of him.'

Shepard tormented her for six months before he found her living in Santa Fe, California and later in Hartford, Connecticut.

Finally after almost 20 years of protracted and prolonged harrassment across the United States Moses has been found guilty of federal stalking charges.

Linda, who was 27 when she agreed to the innocent stroll, said of their first meeting: 'It was fine. We just walked around Central Park, got to know each other. I just decided on that date that he didn’t interest me at all.'

But Shepard - who claims to have 'an Ivy League education' - didn't get the message and began hounding his victim as she moved across statelines to escape him.

Innocent stroll: Shepard would not take no for an answer after his victim decided not to pursue their friendship after a walk in Central Park in New York

The teacher-turned-fitness instructor spent two decades moving to New Mexico, Arizona, California and Connecticut after she abandoned New York.

And as soon as Shepherd found her he would again bombard her with phone calls, emails, letters, CDs and porn.

He would wait until restraining orders would run out and then restart his vile crusade renewing his fantasy of reuniting with her.

His terrified victim even ensured that all official records for her showed that she lived with her parents in Tucson, Arizona.

But nothing could stop him. It was when he tracked her down to yet another home in Connecticut in February 2010 with a chilling death threat that she feared he might kill her.

She explained: 'He said he’s ‘coming for me.’ And that’s when I feared for my life. He came here; he scoped out my house; he scoped out my work. He’s never taken no for an answer.'

Police then arrested Shepard at his Arizona home in May 2010 and alerted the FBI.

He now faces five years behind bars following a federal trial.

Linda added: 'I hope that justice is served and that there’s more awareness that stalking is a serious crime.'

And she said: 'I was trying to get him to stop, and he won’t. But I’m also just a really positive, strong person, and I try to live my life as normally as I can.'
