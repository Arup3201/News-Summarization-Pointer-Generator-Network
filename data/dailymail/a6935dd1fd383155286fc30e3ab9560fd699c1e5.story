Smug: Iraqi security forces and Sunni tribesmen gather around the body of an Islamic State fighter after repelling an attack on a military post during battles for control of Haditha Dam

Lording it over: The Islamic State force trying to capture the dam was wiped out with the help of U.S. air strikes that widened what Barack Obama called a campaign to ultimately defeat the jihadist movement

It came after an attack by ISIS on a military post during the visit of Ahmed al-Dulaimi, the governor of Iraq's Anbar province, amid running gun battles for control of the Haditha Dam.

Dulaimi was injured during the attack, which also wounded Abdulhakim al-Jughaifi, the administrative official responsible for Haditha, and seven soldiers, shortly after the town of Barwanah was retaken from militants.

A suicide bomber then struck the convoy carrying Dulaimi toward Haditha for treatment, killing one soldier and wounding six others.

Governor Ahmed al-Dulaimi later tweeted that he was not seriously hurt.

The IS force trying to capture the dam was wiped out with the help of U.S. air strikes that widened what Barack Obama called a campaign to ultimately defeat the jihadist movement.

Islamic
 State fighters appear to be using captured U.S. military-issue arms and
 weapons supplied to moderate rebels in Syria by Saudi Arabia, according
 to a report published today.

The
 study by the London-based small-arms research organisation Conflict 
Armament Research documented weapons seized by Kurdish forces from 
militants in Iraq and Syria over a 10-day period in July.

The
 report said the jihadists disposed of 'significant quantities' of 
U.S.-made small arms including M16 assault rifles and included photos 
showing the markings 'Property of US Govt'.

It
 also found that anti-tank rockets used by IS in Syria were 'identical 
to M79 rockets transferred by Saudi Arabia to forces operating under the
 Free Syrian Army umbrella in 2013'.

The rockets were made in the then Yugoslavia in the 1980s.

Islamic
 State is believed to have seized large quantities of weapons from 
Syrian military installations it has captured as well as arms supplied 
by the United States to the Iraqi army after it swept through northern 
Iraq in recent weeks.

The militants could have opened or 
damaged the dam, flooding wide areas as far as Baghdad's international 
airport, where hundreds of US personnel are stationed, national security
 council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

US defence secretary Chuck Hagel, travelling in Georgia, said the Iraqi government had asked the U.S. to launch the airstrikes.

The six-month-old battle for control 
of the Haditha Dam has been a rare case of co-operation between local 
Sunni tribes and the Shi'ite-led Iraqi military.

The
 Juhayfa tribe in Haditha has a long-standing fight with the Islamic 
State, which split with its parent organization Al Qaeda last year.

Anbar is complicated terrain for the 
Americans as they seek to root out Islamic State, since Sunnis fighting 
on behalf of the Baghdad government are the exception to the rule.

The
 large desert province, bordering Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, has 
been at war with Baghdad since last December when then-Prime Minister 
Nuri al-Maliki sent troops to raze an anti-government demonstrators' 
camp.

That sparked a tribal revolt against Maliki whom Sunnis accused of isolating them with indiscriminate arrests.

Islamic State fighters took advantage of the chaos to muscle in and become the dominant force among Sunnis.

The
 fighting there, which has displaced 430,000 people since January, 
strengthened the Islamic State ahead of its lightning blitz this summer 
across the north of Iraq, also threatening the semi-autonomous, 
Western-backed enclave of Kurdistan.

Meanwhile,
 the head of the Arab League has urged its members to confront Islamic 
State extremists 'militarily and politically'.

The
 apparent call to arms came as President Barack Obama prepares to go to 
politicians and the American public with his own plan to stop the 
militants.

Backing from the 22-country Arab League could provide crucial support across the Middle East for Mr Obama's effort to assemble an international coalition against IS, the marauding group that has conquered large parts of Iraq and Syria and committed beheadings and mass killings to sow terror.

Nato forces have already agreed to take on the extremists.

Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said what is needed from Arab countries is a 'clear and firm decision for a comprehensive confrontation' with 'cancerous and terrorist' groups.

The Arab League includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Mr Obama will meet congressional leaders tomorrow and then outline his plan to the war-weary American public on Wednesday, the eve of the 13th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.

'I just want the American people to understand the nature of the threat and how we're going to deal with it and to have confidence that we'll be able to deal with it,' the president said.
