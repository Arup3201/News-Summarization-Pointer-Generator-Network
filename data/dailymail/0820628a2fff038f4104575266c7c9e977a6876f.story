The Duchess of Cambridge watched as Olympics history was made today as she had a ringside seat for the first final of the women's boxing. And Kate couldn't conceal her delight that the first female champion was from Great Britain as Nicola Adams won the gold medal at the ExCel centre.

Adams overwhelmed China's double world champion Ren Cancan 16-7 in the women's flyweight division.

Kate sat with MP Nick Clegg, rower Sir Steve Redgrave, Sir Timothy Lawrence and Princess Anne to cheer the boxer from Leeds to victory.

Kate's cheers joined those of the 10,000-strong crowd whose roars for Adams lifted the roof of the East London arena.

Supporters were already on their feet for a standing ovation as Adams, 29, was named the winner over Ren, a three-time world champion.

They witnessed a historic moment as women's boxing made its debut at the Olympics at the London 2012 Games.

Raised the roof: David Cameron was also among the thousands of spectators who roared Adams to victory in London's ExCel

It's a knockout: Adams floored her rival in one round for a convincing win

After the title fight, Adams said winning was a 'dream come true'.

'I've just wanted this all my life. To think I've finally done it, I'm finally here. All this support has really made my day,' she said.

Adam's supporters also included Prime Minister David Cameron who seems to have dispelled his 'curse of Cameron' tag now he has witnessed a number of Team GB successes at London 2012.

Tense: The Duchess held her clasped hands to her lips as she watched the fight

Golden girl: Adams said winning was a dream come true

Earlier in the day, the Duchess was at the Olympic Park to watch Britain's synchronised swimmers in action.

Kate smiled and clapped as she followed the team technical routines at the aquatics centre which included a performance from Team GB.

The
swimmers can hold their breath for up to a minute as they perform their
complex routines. It was perhaps this fact that amazed the Duchess as 
she talked to official team GB ambassador Robin Cousins during the 
event.

Shocked: The Duchess of Cambridge looks amazed by a comment made by official team GB ambassador Robin Cousins while watching the synchronised swimmers today

Admiration: The pair are then full of applause for the swimmers at the aquatics centre

Kate arrived on her own at the event when the seats were still relatively empty and talked to Games Maker Jenny Gray before Cousins, a former GB figure skater and Dancing On Ice judge, took the seat next to her.

However, while the Duchess wasn't joined by her husband Prince William or any other members of the British royal family, she was not the only member of royalty in the building. Prince Albert II of Monaco also attended and took a seat in a row behind Kate. She greeted him with a kiss on the cheek as he took his seat.

Plenty of room: The seats were relatively empty when the Duchess first arrived at the venue on the 13th day of London's Olympic action...

... but soon Kate is joined by more royalty as Prince Albert II of Monaco takes a seat behind her and greets her with a kiss on each cheek

Royal small talk: The pair continue to chat while they wait for the swimmers

Making them laugh: Kate kept everyone entertained during the breaks in performances

On day 13 of the London 2012 games, 
Kate again wore her Team GB white polo T-shirt with Zara skinny jeans 
and LK Bennett wedges. However, the stylish Duchess may have wished she 
ditched her favourite footwear for flats as she tried to negotiate the 
steep steps of the aquatics centre in her high wedge heels.

Kate
kept her accessories simple with a silver bracelet and pearl drop 
earrings while her sapphire engagement ring, which once belonged to 
Princess Diana, couldn't be missed whenever she applauded the 
performances.

Impressed: The Duchess punched her fists in the air and clapped as she watched the swimmers

The Duchess has previously cheered Team GB athletes to glory in the velodrome and athletics stadium but unfortunately she wasn't able to be a lucky charm for Britain's synchronised swimmers today.

The team, made up of Yvette Baker, Katie Clark, Katrina Dawkins, Olivia Federici, Jennifer Knobbs, Asha and Jenna Randall, Katherine Skelton and Victoria Lucass finished in 6th place with a score of 87.300.

Stylish: Kate wore her favourite wedges with Zara jeans and a white Team GB polo shirt and accessorised with a delicate silver bracelet and pearl drop earrings
