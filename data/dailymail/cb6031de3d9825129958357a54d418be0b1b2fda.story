This is the moment a defenceless chameleon comes face-to-face with a very hungry snake and is eaten for lunch.

Footage shows the savage serpent circling the animal before striking it and injecting its body with a toxic paralysing poison.

The pictures and video were taken by British photographer Paula Webster in Madagascar at the Andasibe National Park.

Lunch: The snake opens his jaws wide injecting it with paralysing venom

Mrs Webster said: 'We had been walking since dawn but it was very hot as there was little shade from the forest cover. 

'As I rounded a bend on the forest path I saw a chameleon in the middle of the path swaying from side to side.

'Then I suddenly noticed a snake at the edge of the path. 

'The snake had spotted the chameleon and was slowly circling round it.'

David Attenborough moment: Paula Webster has been studying wildlife in Madagascar for 15 years

According to Mrs Webster, the two creatures warily moved around each other, the chameleon seemingly entranced by the snake. 

Suddenly the serpent pounced and bit the chameleon, injecting it with a paralysing venom. 

Mrs Webster has been shooting video footage for nearly 15-years and her footage mainly has wildlife and travel themes.

'I was amazed.' said Mrs Webster. 'This was a once in a lifetime sighting. My Malagasy guide, Claude, had never seen anything like it in 15-years of studying wildlife in Madagascar's National Parks. 

'This was a real David Attenborough moment for me! I was thrilled to have the privilege of seeing such a fantastic display of animal behaviour. 

'Then I felt guilty, should I be so excited when I was watching one animal kill another? This was certainly nature, red in tooth and claw.'

Andasibe-Mantadia National Park is 155sq kilometres of protected rainforest in eastern Madagascar. 

Rain falls over the forest for 210 days of each year, which is habitat to thousands of different species, including many rare and endangered animals.

The main threat to the park comes from the destruction of habitats caused by logging.
