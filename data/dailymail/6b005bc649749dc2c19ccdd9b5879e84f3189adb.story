Four patients have been infected with an antibiotic-resistant 'superbug' linked to a type of medical scope that is used on more than a half-million people in the U.S. every year.

The incident took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where the patients were confirmed with the bacteria known as CRE.

The revelation comes two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria.

Four patients have been infected with an antibiotic-resistant 'superbug' linked to a type of medical scope that is used on more than a half-million people in the U.S. every year. The incident took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (above) in Los Angeles where the patients were confirmed with bacteria known as CRE

Cedars-Sinai said that it halted endoscopic procedures after learning about the UCLA outbreak and launched its own investigation.

However, the germ may have been transmitted through a duodenoscope  during procedures performed between last August and January. 

The hospital said there is no evidence other patients are at risk, but as a precaution, it sent free home-test kits to 64 patients who had procedures to diagnose pancreatic and bile-duct problems.

In recent years, hospitals across the country have grappled with cases of CRE, or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, with some linked to hard-to-clean medical scopes made by Olympus and other companies.

The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs and can contribute to death in up to half of seriously infected patients. 

Last month, two people died and 16 were hospitalized in North Carolina after contracting CRE at an unnamed hospital.

The latest cases come two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (above) where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria

The latest infections were reported to state and local health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

One patient died, but Cedars-Sinai said the cause was an underlying medical condition  not related to the superbug infection.

UCLA and Cedars-Sinai said infections occurred at the hospitals despite cleaning the devices to the manufacturer's standards.

Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are bacteria that are unique in that they are resistant to most antibiotics. 

They typically live in the soil or water. 

Patients infected with the bacteria are typically not symptomatic, but can develop pneumonia, kidney and bladder infections, and bloodstream infections.

They began appearing in the U.S. roughly twelve years ago, and have since spread to at least 41 states. 

There is no effective treatment yet available for the bacteria, which can linger in the body more than a year, and mortality rates hover at 40 to 50 per cent.

Both have since implemented more stringent disinfection procedures, and Cedars-Sinai said it removed the contaminated scope from use and will resume endoscopic procedures after consulting with other hospitals and government agencies. 

In the UCLA outbreak, the hospital offered free testing to about 170 patients who were potentially exposed, and the hospital said Wednesday it does not have an update on the results.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it received reports of 135 patients in the U.S. who may have been infected by contaminated scopes between January 2013 and December 2014.

On February 19, it alerted hospitals with a safety warning that even with thorough cleaning, the risk of infection may persist, according to CBS News.

The agency has acknowledged that the design of the scopes can make them hard to clean, but it said pulling them off the market would deprive patients of 'this beneficial and often life-saving procedure.'

Olympus Corp. of the Americas declined to comment on the Cedars infections. 

It previously said it is working with the FDA on the infection problem and providing guidance to hospitals.
