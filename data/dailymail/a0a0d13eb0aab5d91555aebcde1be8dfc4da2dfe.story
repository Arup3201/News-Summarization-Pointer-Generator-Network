It has been a strange old start to the season for Will Grigg.

Unwanted and un-needed at Brentford, the striker was deemed surplus to requirements and farmed out on loan to Milton Keynes Dons.

Yet just six games into the season and Grigg is now the hottest property in League after he scored a brilliant brace to set the Dons on their way to a famous 4-0 Capital One Cup win over Manchester United.

Humiliation: United assistant manager Ryan Giggs has his head in his hands near the end of the game

The 23-year-old was rightly awarded the man of the match award at Stadium MK on Tuesday night after tormenting Jonny Evans and Co for the entire match.

His first goal, although fortuitous, displayed a real striker's instinct. Evans passed the ball straight to Samir Carruthers, who put the ball into Grigg's path and the striker placed by ball past David de Gea.

The second was arguably even more impressive, however.

Grigg ghosted in behind Anderson and, with no United centre-backs in sight, chested a pinpoint cross into the back of the net.

Tuesday night's displayed represented quite a turnaround for a player whose stock had fallen immeasurably since his £325,000 move from Walsall to MK Dons in July 2013.

VIDEO Robinson in shock as MK Dons stun United

The five-cap Northern Ireland striker had scored 20 goals in 45 games during the 2012-13 season for the Saddlers and arrived in Milton Keynes with a glowing reputation.

But last season was not kind to the former Stratford Town striker.

A return of just five goals in 34 league appearances led to him falling down the pecking order and, eventually, shipped out on a season-long loan.

He has scored just once in Dons' first four league games but his brace against United could kickstart a goal-scoring spree.

Dons boss Karl Robinson has described Grigg as someone with 'pedigree' who is 'a goalscorer at this (League One) level'.

Well, after his match-winning display against Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side, perhaps he has ambitions to prove his worth at an even high level than that in the future.
