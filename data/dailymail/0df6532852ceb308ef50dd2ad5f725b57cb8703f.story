At least 21 miners in South Africa who were trapped by debris in an abandoned mine shaft and later rescued face charges of illegal mining, authorities said.

Ten miners emerged from the mine shaft near Johannesburg on Monday, one day after emergency responders rescued a group of 11, the South African Press Association reported. The men were in good health and rescue workers handed them over to police.

Emergency workers said other miners who were working illegally at the site near Johannesburg refused to come out of the shaft because they feared arrest.

Rescue
 teams were able to speak to about 30 miners near the top of an 
abandoned gold mine shaft the entrance of which was covered by a large 
rock.

The

 trapped miners told rescue teams that as many as 200 others were stuck 
further down a steep tunnel at the mine in Benoni, on the 
outskirts of Johannesburg.Â

The
 South African news agency quotes emergency responder Werner Vermaak as 
saying none of the 30 miners in the smaller group appeared to be 
seriously injured.

Illegal mining is common in South Africa, a major producer of gold and platinum.

A police patrol in the semi-rural 
Johannesburg suburb of Benoni, where gold has been mined for decades, 
had been alerted by shouts from the trapped miners.

Rescuers
 in yellow helmets, dark blue overalls and boots clustered around the 
shaft as the miners emerged into the late afternoon sunshine.

It is believed that four of the men have been since rescued, and more are expected to follow them to the surface

A crane was used to shift a large concrete slab that was obstructing the shaft belonging to the Chinese-owned bullion producer Gold One, which has prospecting rights to the mine but is not currently working it.

Gold One spokesman Grant Stuart said the miners were trapped in the 'New Kleinfontein 6' ventilation shaft.

'The illegal miners have dug a tunnel right next to it to access the shaft and it has collapsed behind them,' he said, adding that heavy rain may have triggered the collapse.

Gold One delisted last month from the Johannesburg and Australian bourses after all of its share capital was acquired by BCX Gold Investment Holdings, a Chinese consortium.
