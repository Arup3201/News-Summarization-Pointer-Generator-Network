Most bored commuters pass the time by reading or listening to music.

But this group of friends found a more creative way to entertain themselves. 

Two men were filmed as they played an imaginary game of ping pong - using their mouths to mimic the sound of the ball hitting the paddles - as they waited for the next Tube at Chancery Lane.

Passing the time: The friends start by using their mouths to mimic the sound of a ping pong ball hitting a paddle (left) before adding in arm movements (right) to make it look like they are playing a rally on the platform

 

Competitive: After starting with a few gentle shots, the contest descends into a series of complex moves. One player's powerful forehand (left) forces his opponent to run the length of the platform at Chancery Lane (right)

The one-minute video, taken on a smartphone, starts with the two friends making the clicking sounds as they stand across from each other on the platform.

After a few seconds of verbal rallying, one of the men swings his arm back - as if to hit the incoming ball. And his friend is quick to fire a forearm shot back at him.

As their friends look on, the two men become more concentrated - and their shots more elaborate.

The contest descends into a series of over the shoulder shots, hits between the legs and powerful volleys.

Entertainment: Amused commuters can be heard laughing as the game intensifies - with one of the players even kicking a ball (left) to give it some extra force. The clip has been viewed more than one million times

Showdown: One of the players crouches down, ready to pick up the imaginary ball as it 'bounces' along the ground towards him (left). His opponent leans back (right), ready to return a ball that has been hit into the air

Final shot: After nearly a minute of play, the match eventually finishes when one of the men - unable to reach the ball - collapses onto the platform. The imaginary game was an inventive way to pass time on the platform
