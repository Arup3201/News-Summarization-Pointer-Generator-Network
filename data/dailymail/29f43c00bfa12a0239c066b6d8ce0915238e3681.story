Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey has backed Les Ferdinand after he was charged by the Football Association for abusing a match official.

The FA have accused Ferdinand of using ‘abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official in or around the tunnel area’ following their defeat to Tottenham last weekend.

Ferdinand, QPR’s director of football, has until 6pm on Friday to respond to the charge. But Ramsey said: ‘Les was frustrated after the game. We could’ve had two penalties. We’re talking about me keeping my job. It could’ve gone a significant way to me keeping it.

‘Les is very passionate about the club. We lost a game we probably shouldn’t have due to two very poor decisions. It didn’t help us.’ 

One of the penalty appeals was when Mauricio Isla was challenged by goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and the other occurred when Nabil Bentaleb appeared to block a Charlie Austin shot with his hands on the line. Referee Craig Pawson gave nothing for either decision.

QPR eventually lost the match 2-1 after Spurs striker Harry Kane struck twice. Ramsey said: ’When we’re near the bottom and we’re fighting for our lives and you have two strong penalty shouts you expect people to be frustrated. Everyone was upset with the referee and how we lost the game.’ 

QPR owner Tony Fernandes has told Ramsey the manager’s job is his if he manages to keep the team up. But Ramsey added: ‘I’d accept keeping QPR up and to not get the job.’
