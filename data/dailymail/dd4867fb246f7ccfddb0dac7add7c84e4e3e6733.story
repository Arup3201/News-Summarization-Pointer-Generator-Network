Astronomers have revealed a pair of galaxies just like our own.

It is the first time an 'exact match' of the Milky Way, our own galaxy, has been found in our local universe.

The discovery was made using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey (GAMA), a project that brings
together data from six telescopes to build a
3D map of galaxies in our local universe.

This image shows one of the two ¿exact matches¿ to the Milky Way system found in the survey. The larger galaxy, denoted GAMA202627, which is similar to the Milky Way clearly has two large companions off to the bottom left of the image.

The research was presented today at the International Astronomical Union General Assembly in Beijing unveiled the rare sight.

The team released an image showing one of the two ‘exact matches’ to the Milky Way system found in the survey.

The larger galaxy, denoted GAMA202627, which is similar to the Milky Way clearly has two large companions off to the bottom left of the image (above). 

In the image bluer colours indicate hotter, younger, stars like many of those that are found in our galaxy.

The Milky Way is a fairly typical galaxy on its own, the team said, but when paired with its close neighbours - the Magellanic Clouds - it is very rare, and could have been one of a kind.

Astronomer Dr Aaron Robotham, jointly from the University of Western Australia node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) and the University of St Andrews in Scotland, searched for groups of galaxies similar to ours in the most detailed map of the local Universe yet, the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey (GAMA).

'We’ve never found another galaxy system like the Milky Way before, which is not surprising considering how hard they are to spot,' said Dr  Robotham.

It’s only recently become possible to do the type of analysis that lets us find similar groups.

The Milky Way: Scientists have now discovered two galaxies in our universe they say are 'exact matches'

'Everything had to come together at once: we needed telescopes good enough to detect not just galaxies but their faint companions, we needed to look at large sections of the sky, and most of all we needed to make sure no galaxies were missed in the survey”

Sophisticated simulations of how galaxies form don’t produce many examples similar to the Milky Way and its surrounds, predicting them to be quite a rare occurrence.

Astronomers haven’t been able to tell just how rare until now, with the discovery of not just one but two exact matches amongst the hundreds of thousands of galaxies surveyed.

'We found about 3% of galaxies similar to the Milky Way have companion galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds, which is very rare indeed.

'In total we found 14 galaxy systems that are similar to ours, with two of those being an almost exact match,' says Dr Robotham.

The Milky Way is locked in a complex cosmic dance with its close companions the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are clearly visible in the southern hemisphere night sky.

Many galaxies have smaller galaxies in orbit around them, but few have two that are as large as the Magellanic Clouds.

Dr Robotham’s work also found that although companions like the Magellanic Clouds are rare, when they are found they’re usually near a galaxy very like the Milky Way, meaning we’re in just the right place at the right time to have such a great view in our night sky.

'The galaxy we live in is perfectly typical, but the nearby Magellenic Clouds are a rare, and possibly short-lived, occurrence.

'We should enjoy them whilst we can, they'll only be around for a few billion more years,' said Dr Robotham.

Dr Robotham and colleagues have been awarded further time on telescopes in New South Wales and Chile to study these Milky Way twin systems now that they’ve been found.
