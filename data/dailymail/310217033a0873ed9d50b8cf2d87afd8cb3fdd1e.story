Parishioners at a small church in Hampshire who were without a vicar for more than a year have had their patience rewarded with two for the price of one.

Huband and wife clergy the Reverend Mike and the Reverend Nicky-Sue Terry began their new joint job today as vicars of St Mary's Church in Warsash, near Southampton.

They are believed to be one of very few married couples who are both Church of England clergy and who share a job.

Married clerics the Rev Mike and the Rev Nicky-Sue Terry begin their job-share at St Mary's Warsash today

Before beginning their new job today, the Terrys, both 52, were to be formally installed as vicars by the Bishop of Portsmouth, Christopher Foster, at a service tonight.

Mr Terry said: 'Although married clergy couples are no longer so unusual in the Church of England, what makes our post different is that we will be sharing the responsibilities equally.

'We see it as a kind of job-share for God'

The couple met while training for ordination in Cambridge and married five years ago.

Mrs Terry said: 'We've fallen in love all over again, this time with the spiritual treasure of St Mary's and the wonderful gem that is Warsash village.

'We're really looking forward to getting to know this area much better, and the people who live here, and believe that we will be able to bring much more to this role than either one of us could individually.'

Since their marriage, the Terrys have lived in nearby Fareham, where Mr Terry, a former Commander in the Royal Navy, moved when he worked on HMS Sultan.

Previously, his wife worked for the Christian publishing and teaching charity CWR.

St Mary's Church in the Hampshire village has been without a permanent priest since May last year

They were ordained together in Portsmouth Cathedral, and went on to work as curates, with Mr Terry based at St John's Church in Fareham and his wife at St Mary's Church in Gosport.

Last September, the couple was invited by the Bishop of Portsmouth to take on the job at St Mary's on a temporary basis, and when the permanent job was advertised, they decided to apply.

But the couple have been working together at St Mary's Church in Warsash, which hasn't had a permanent priest since last May, after they were invited by the Bishop of Portsmouth on a temporary basis last September.

So when the post, which has been without a permanent priest since May last year, was advertised they decided to jointly apply.

Mr Terry said: 'We just felt we were called.

'We both fitted here with our different skills and gifts, and felt we both seemed to have something to contribute on an equal basis.'
