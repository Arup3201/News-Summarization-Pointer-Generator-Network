As noises go, it isn't the most pleasant sound in the world.

But this baby is horrified when he hears his mother unwrapping a roll of sticky tape.

Nic Taylor, 32, a photographer from St Helens, Merseyside, filmed Lucas's reaction as Gemma rips off strips of sellotape while wrapping Mother's Day gifts. 

Five-month-old Lucas is relaxed until he hears the loud noise of his mother unwrapping a roll of sellotape

The footage shows the five-month-old boy perched in an interactive baby walker wearing in a onesie with the television on in the background.

Although the child is surrounded by an array of toys, he remains uninterested and motionless, until his mother begins noisily unwrapping the tape.

At the first loud rip, Lucas jumps and his face is a picture of shock as he stares at his mother, mouth wide open, with a horrified expression on his face.

He looks alarmed for a while and then relaxes momentarily, gazing back at the television.

Upon hearing the loud rip, he looks visibly panicked and looks at his mother with a worried expression

What on earth is that? Catching Lucas' hilariously panicked reactions, his mother laughs and apologies to him

As his mother loudly pulls off another strip of sellotape, the baby boy jolts again, rattling his toys from his shock, with a look of sheer panic on his face.

His mother is unable to hide her amusement as she chuckles and apolgises, saying: 'I'm sorry sweetheart!.'

Nic Taylor posted the home video on YouTube with the aptly-named caption, 'Cute Baby Gets a Shock (funny)'. 

Taylor said: '[Gemma] felt so bad that the tape was making Lucas jump that she did the rest of the wrapping in another room.'
