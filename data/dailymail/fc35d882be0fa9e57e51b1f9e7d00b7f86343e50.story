You might not think of frogs as pioneers of environmental activism.

But American biologist and artist Brandon Ballengée has used deformities found in wild amphibians to highlight the damage we are inflicting on the planet.

By chemically cleaning and staining terminally deformed frogs, Ballengée hopes to show how chemical run-off is harming natural wildlife.

These images of deformed frogs by American artist Ballengée show how some animals are unable to grow the correct amount of limbs due to chemicals

As a biologist, Ballengée's research focuses on deformities in amphibians.

The frogs were collected across the Americas, Australia, Asia and Europe.

Enzymes were then used to make the tissues transparent.Injecting coloured dyes into the bones, tissues and deformities made them stand out.

The specimens were then posed and imaged with a high-resolution scanner.Finally, the images were printed with water-based ink.

This includes those found with more or less limbs than they should have.

These mutations can be caused by chemical run-off from factories, which can wreak havoc on complex ecosystems.

The chemicals make the frogs more susceptible to the invasion of violent parasites into their balanced ecosystems.

Ballengée took his scientific research and combined it with his artistic talents to create the curious displays of art.

'These abnormalities are most likely caused by predatory injury or parasitic infection while the frogs were still tadpoles,' Ballengée told the Metro.

'Predators and parasites are natural, but environmental degradation appears to be increasing this phenomena.'

The artistic works, known as Malamp: Reliquaries, are currently being shown at an exhibition in the Museum Het Domein in Sittard,
the Netherlands until June.

Some of the frogs, including this Pacific tree frog from California, US can be seen to have additional limbs rather than missing limbs due to the mutations

Parasites can feed on young tadpoles and alter the growth of their limbs, creating deformed frogs

The entire project has taken Ballengée over 10 years to compile with the help of collaborators including Stanley K. Sessions, Peter R. Warny, Richard
Sunter and David M. Green.

To find the deformed amphibians he headed to various wetlands and marshlands across the world including the UK and US.

Each inch of every frog was then chemically cleaned and stained with a different colour to produce a beautiful medium for art.

This colouring also helped scientists understand the nature of the deformations.

From his research he found the culprit for some of the missing or excess limbs were a pair of parasites called dragonfly nymphs.

A deformed English toad (left) from Yorkshire, UK and a North American green frog collected in New York, US are both seen to be missing limbs, possibly due to chemical waste

The frogs are thought to become more susceptible to parasites owing to chemical interference

Some of the frogs are seen to have an usually large number of limbs due to the mutations

These parasites feed on young tadpoles and alter the growth of their limbs.

Ballengée and his partners, however, are convinced that chemical pollution has been a major contributor to the excessive deformities seen in the amphibians.

Colouring the bones with enzymes revealed the unusual structure of the frogs

They believe unsavoury environment elements have increased infections and compromised immune systems, slowly debilitating the natural growth process and making the frogs more
susceptible to harmful parasites.

Ultimately, Ballengée considers amphibians to
be biology's answer to the coal mine canary, a corner of life that needs to be
carefully observed to monitor our well-being.

By depicting his findings as accessible art, Ballengée hopes he will be able to open the eyes of the world to the environmental issues that
concern us all.
