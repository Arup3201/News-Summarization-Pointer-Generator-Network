Disgraced former Navy chaplain Gordon 'Dr. Chaps' Klingenschmitt has weighed in on a recent ruling by a Colorado court that forced a Denver bakery to serve wedding cakes to same-sex couples, slamming the plaintiffs at the center of the lawsuit have 'demonic spirits manifesting inside them' and are 'cooperating with the devil.

In his latest anti-gay tirade, Klingenshmitt, who has become infamous for the pro-discrimination statements made on his daily 'Pray In Jesus Name' TV program, said Charlie Craig and David Mullins - who sued their local bakery for refusing to sell them a cake for their nuptials - are 'inhuman'.

Klingenshmitt also said he is looking into having Administrative Law Judge Robert N. Spencer - who made the bakery treat gay people as regular customers - impeached in the wake of the ruling, according to the Huffington Post.

'I admit that the two men are humans -- they're men,' Klingenshmitt said.Â

Controversial: Former Navy chaplain Gordon 'Dr. Chaps' Klingenschmitt has slammed a decision forcing a Denver baker to serve same-sex couple 'unhuman' on his TV program 'Pray In Jesus Name'

David Mullins, left, and Charlie Craig, right, successfully sued a Colorado bakery after their order for a rainbow wedding cake was turned down by the owner

'But when they manifest sexual immorality, there's something inside of them that is manifesting and, on this show, we like to discern the spirits and I would say that's a demonic spirit that is manifesting inside of them.'

He then added: 'They're cooperating with the devil and there is something unhuman inside of them.'

An evangelical Protestant chaplain, Klingenschmitt was involuntarily discharged from the Navy and fined $3000 in 2007 for wearing his military uniform at a protest in Washington that was trying to push the government to guarantee the right of chaplains to 'pray in the name of Jesus'.

He is not the first to renounce the Denver ruling.

Last week, the American Family Association's Bryan Fischer said Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips was a victim of what he described as 'the Secular Inquisition' on an installment of his 'Focal Point' radio show.

In September Judge Spencer ruled that Phillips had illegally discriminated against the plaintiffs.

He ordered Phillips to accommodate same-sex couples or face fines and other penalties.

Owner: Jack Philips maintained in court that his belief in Jesus Christ preventing him from making cakes for same-sex couples. The judge ruled in September he had to make such cakes or face fines and other penalties

Ongoing: Charlie Craig and David Mullins said they knew of other gay couples who also had orders refused, not necessarily for wedding occasions

'At first blush, it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses,' Spencer wrote in his 13-page ruling.

'This view, however, fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are.'

Colorado allows civil unions for same-sex couples, but defines marriage as between one man and one woman.

Craig, 33, and Mullins, 28, were wed in Massachusetts, one of 16 U.S. states that have legalized same-sex marriage, but wanted to have a celebration of their nuptials in Colorado.

Phillips refused to bake the cake, saying his Christian beliefs prevented him from doing so.

Priorities: In another instance a gay couple had their order refused but when told the order was for a dog, the bakery happily agreed to proceed

Winners:  Charlie Craig and David Mullins on their wedding day

Nicolle Martin, an attorney for Masterpiece Cakeshop, said the judge's order puts Phillips in an impossible position of going against his Christian faith.

'He can't violate his conscience in order to collect a paycheck,' she said.

'If Jack can't make wedding cakes, he can't continue to support his family. And in order to make wedding cakes, Jack must violate his belief system. That is a reprehensible choice. It is antithetical to everything America stands for.'

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division, which ruled that Phillips had violated a state law barring discrimination at public accommodations based on race, gender or sexual orientation.

Spencer then upheld the commission's findings.

Mullins said in a statement it was 'offensive and dehumanizing' when he and Craig were denied service at the bakery.

After venting such frustrations on Facebook, Mullins received an outpouring of support from the community, with the story 'catching fire' in the media.

'We felt that the best way to honor the support that they had given us was to follow this complaint through,' he said.

'No one should fear being turned away from a public business because of who they are,' he said.

Mullins said he and Craig were 'ecstatic' about the decision.

'To a certain extent, though, I don't think that this is necessarily a surprise,' he said.

Phillips may appeal.

The discrimination case of Charlie Craig and David Mullins (pictured) was far from the first legal hurdle same sex couples have had to jump over in Colorado

Recent advances on gay rights only underscore Colorado's difficult past on the issue.

In 2006, voters banned gay marriage.

More notably, in 1992, voters approved a ban on municipal anti-discrimination laws set up to protect gays, leading some to brand Colorado a 'hate state'.

Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court said the law, known as Amendment 2, was unconstitutional.
