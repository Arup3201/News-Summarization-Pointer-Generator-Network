Kim Kardashian and her half-sisters are drawing fury over social media for appearing to send text messages while the audience at MTV's Video Music Awards took a moment of silence in honor of slain black teenager Michael Brown.

Rapper Common was on stage to present the nominees for best hip hop video when he asked the crowd on Sunday to take a minute to think about Brown's death and the racially-charged clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

'Hip hop has always presented a voice for the revolution,' the rapper told the crowd at the Forum in Inglewood. 'I want us all to take a moment of silence for Mike Brown and for peace in this country and in the world.'

Rapper Common spoke about Brown's death as the Kardashian sisters checked their phones and looked bored during the MVAs

The crowd grew silent while the artists bowed their heads in respectful silence. Snoop Dogg offered a peace sign, his head hanging low.

But when 
the camera cut over to Kim and sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner in their
 front-row seats, the three were busy staring into their phone screens.

The
 three looked bored — texting or checking social media or otherwise 
chatting amongst themselves — while the rest of the audience held the 
moment of silence.

Twitter reacted angrily.

'Let's not pretend we're shocked the Kardashian girls were texting during a moment of silence for Ferguson at the VMAs,' wrote one person, Mieke Olva Vlok.

Another, Kid Codi, wrote, 'I would pay TOP DOLLAR to see Kim Kardashian point out Ferguson on a map.'

'every one of our lives matters'

A 15-second video clip was also shown during the ceremony. In the background, a crowd chanted, 'Hands up don't shoot'

Some media outlets pointed out that there was a chance the incident hadn't happened during the moment of silence, but had been broadcast simultaneously due to a lag n the footage.

An MTV rep later told the Daily Star that there was no delay and the events happened at the same time.

A rep for Kim Kardashian denied she was texting but offered no explanation for the pictures of her and her sisters on their phones.

The star-studded audience in Los Angeles fell silent for several seconds in tribute to the 18-year-old Brown, an aspiring rapper who on Aug. 9 was shot and killed by white police officer Darren Wilson.

A 15-second video clip set against a black-and-white image of Ferguson's city sign played while a crowd in the background chanted, 'Hand's up don't shoot,' — the slogan used by protesters in the St. Louis suburb.

The footage included a quote from writer James Baldwin, saying, 'Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.'

Brown will be buried today during a public funeral at a St. Louis Church.

Michael 
Brown's father has called for a 'day of silence' and 'peace' today as his son
 is laid to rest more than two weeks after his death.

The
 teen instantly became a symbol of racial injustice as protesters 
flooded into the streets of the predominantly black community in 
response.
