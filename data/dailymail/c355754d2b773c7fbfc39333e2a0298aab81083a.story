Ramadan is set to add to London's Olympic traffic woes as thousands of Muslims squeeze into non-Games lanes to worship at the many mosques that surround the Olympic Park.

Every year during the month of August, vast crowds of worshippers 
descend on east London - one of the most concentrated Muslim communities in the country - for nightly prayer.

Local councillor Abdal Ullah said the influx of people to the area, between central London and Stratford, will play havoc with Games road links and traffic 
hotpsots.

The district surrounding the Olympic Park is home to more than 250,000 Muslims and almost 100 mosques.

Prayers in Spitalfields: Every year during the month of August, vast crowds of worshippers descend on east London, which has one of the most concentrated Muslim communities in the country

The borough's biggest, The East London Mosque, in Whitechapel, draws over 5,000 congregants during Ramadan.

'The areas all around the mosques get
 very busy around prayer time during Ramadan, and there is often traffic
 chaos on nearby roads and it will be busier on the Underground,' Councillor Ullah told NBCNews.com.

Warning: Local councillor Abdal Ullah said large crowds traveling to the area between central London and Stratford for nightly worship will play havoc with Olympic road links and traffic hotpsots

He added: 'Although the prayers are in the late evening, many people will stay on 
at the Olympic Park after events and will be traveling through East 
London late in the day and might not be expecting it to be congested, 
which is a big concern.'

It is the first time Ramadan has fallen on an Olympic Games since Moscow 1980.

During the religious festival, which started at 
3.17am today, Muslims are expected to go without food and drink 
from dawn until dusk for 30 days.

There are some 3,000 Muslim athletes 
competing in the Games, although most have been given special 
dispensation by religious leaders to waive the obligation while taking 
part.

Meanwhile, 
Londoners were warned today to expect the capital’s roads to 'look and 
feel different' from Monday as work on Olympic-only traffic lanes nears 
completion.

The 30 miles of
 Games Lanes, which will accommodate 1,300 vehicles an hour carrying 
athletes, officials and VIPs, will be in operation from Wednesday.

Road marking for the Lanes - which 
run alongside existing lanes - and alterations to 1,300 sets of traffic 
lights has already begun.

Tonight the final stage of work on the Lanes, involving 2,000 contractors, will start and continue for five nights.

Work
 includes erection of three temporary pedestrian footbridges at Hyde 
Park Corner, and installation of barriers for restricted turns.

The
 first Games Lane - on the M4 in west London - came into operation on 
Monday. Drivers will be able to use the other Games Lanes until they 
become active on Wednesday.

The Lanes form part of a 109-mile Olympic Route Network (ORN) in London and will generally operate between 6am and midnight.

Ready? London motorists are preparing for chaos on the roads of the capital after confusion already struck last week

Confusion: It was unclear when exactly the Olympic lanes came into force

Drivers who illegally use the Lanes or stop along the route face a penalty charge of £130, while illegally parked vehicles will be impounded and could incur a release fee of £200.

Earlier this week, American hurdler Kerron Clement tweeted that his bus journey from Heathrow to the Olympic Village in Stratford, east London, had taken four hours and that this had not offered him a good first impression of London.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said afterwards that it was thought this particular journey actually took two and a half hours. He added that it was hoped to get transfer times to Stratford down to as little as one hour.

Transport for London (TfL) said: 'The works (being carried out) will progressively change London’s road network so that, by Monday morning, London’s road network will look and feel different.'

Restrictions: The A4 takes traffic from the M4, where a Games Lane runs for three and a half miles between junctions three and two on the London-bound carriageway

Leon Daniels, TfL’s surface transport managing director, said: 'Our advice to road users is clear - don’t get caught out. Avoid driving in central London, around the ORN and Games venues.'

Last week the M4 Olympic lane opened and caused widespread confusion on the road.

Motorists were unsure whether they were allowed in the newly opened lane, and many cut in at the last minute before the lane began causing panic amongst the other drivers.

Athletes who had recently arrived in the country took to Twitter to vent their fury over the confusing new road markings.

US 400m hurdler Kerron Clement expressed his frustration when he tweeted: 'Um, so we’ve been lost on the road for four hours’

‘Not a good first impression, London.’

Bizarre: Motorists travelling along Southampton Row in central London face just two options  - and both are illegal. They can either travel in the bus lane, the Olympic lane or on the wrong side of the road

Odd: This picture shows another view of the confusing road. Motorists caught travelling in either a bus lane or Olympic lane during operational hours face a £130 fine

The confusion somehow increased further when it emerged that one of the Olympic lanes in central London meets a bus lane - and there is no road between the two for other motorists.

Dubbed 'the road to nowhere', Southampton Row seems impossible for motorists to navigate down without incurring a heavy fine.

Londoners and visitors can expect more confusion akin to this come Monday as the Games approaches and have been advised to avoid busy areas both on the roads and on public transport links on both the underground and on buses throughout.

Yellow route:
 Roads on this route will have a dedicated 'Olympic-only' lane for 
athletes, officials, VIPs, sponsors and media. The lanes will be in 
force from 6am until midnight.

Red route:
 Roads on this route, the busiest "core section" of the VIP network, 
will be affected by major restrictions to speed up traffic but will be 
fully open to the public. Measures could include bans on parking and 
right-turns, suspension of pedestrian crossings, phasing of traffic 
lights and no public entry from side roads.

Blue route:
 Roads on this route will only be affected on competition days. They 
will run from the athletes' accommodation to venues such as Wembley 
Arena, Earls Court and Wimbledon.
