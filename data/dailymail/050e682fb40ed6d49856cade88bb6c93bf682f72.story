Liverpool have been defeated 4-1 by Real Madrid in the UEFA Youth League with young Scot Jack Harper impressing for the Spanish giants in their win. 

The hosts took an early lead when Cristian Cedres curled home a free-kick but Cameron Brannagan equalised for Liverpool just before half-time.

After Liverpool had started the second half in a positive manner, Real seized control, taking the lead through young Scota Jack Harper and then adding further goals late on through Borja Mayoral and Jose Lazo.

Real Mardid were seeking revenge at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano after Liverpool’s youngsters beat them in a 3-2 thriller two weeks ago.

Harry Wilson struck the winner with just two minutes remaining after the Reds had surrendered a two-goal advantage at Langtree Park but weren't deterred and snatched victory when Jordan Rossiter teed up Wilson for a cool side-footed finish.

Three were no repeat of that result on Tuesday evening as Real came firing out of the blocks early on the Spanish capital and were 1-0 ahead early on when Cristian Cedres curled in a spectacular free-kick from 25 yards out.

Liverpool grew into the contest and got a deserved equaliser through Cameron Brannagan who finished from close range to draw level.

Liverpool made a bright start to the second half but it was Real who would strike with Scottish wonder kid Jack Harper pouncing at the back post.

The floodgates opened after that with Mayoral and Lazo making sure of the result.
