Beautiful parts of the county are being 'gutted' by second home owners pricing young families out of the area, Nick Clegg claimed today.

Mr Clegg said parts of the Lake District and the South West were being 'filleted' by wealthy families who were driving up house prices by snapping up second homes in the countryside.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he was looking at measures to cap the number of holiday homes that are blamed for destroying picturesque towns and villages.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg this morning said holiday home owners had 'gutted' beautiful areas of the country like Cornwall and the Lake District 

Lib Dem MPs have led calls to limit the number of second homes in an area or force families to get planning permission to turn a permanent home into a holiday getaway.

There have also been calls to hike council tax on second homes. The Coalition has so far only given councils the power to remove the council tax discount on second homes, which ranged from 10 per cent to 50 per cent.

At a press conference this morning - called to unveil a manifesto promise to ring-fence education funding 'from cradle to college' - Mr Clegg was asked whether there would be an election pledge on tackle the blight of holiday homes.

The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'It’s a huge problem in parts of the South West and the Lake District.

'And we’ll constantly look at we can make sure, yes, people who want to come and invest in the community and create a holiday home are not barred from doing so, but that we don’t have this problem of the whole community being filleted. Gutted.

'With no prospect of youngsters finding a home they can call their own. One of the ways out of this, difficult though it is in beautiful parts of the country, is to build more homes on the scale we need.'

Villages like Wells next the Sea in Norfolk are luring second-home buyers looking to escape the city. But this can drive up property prices, forcing local families out

Nick Clegg spends at least one holiday a year in his wife's family home in the tiny Spanish village of Olmedo, near Valladolid.

He also has a share in his family's 20 room ski chalet in Switzerland's Klosters ski resort - the Alpine playground of the Royals.

The traditionally-designed lakeside villa – built by Mr Clegg’s Dutch grandfather - is worth an estimated £7million.

The Deputy PM also has use of a grace and favour country house, which is usually reserved for the Foreign Secretary, near Sevenoaks in Kent.

Chevening was built in the 17th Century and has 115 rooms to entertain guests at the taxpayers expense.

On top of these options Mr Clegg owns a £1.5million townhouse in South West London - just a stone's throw from the Thames - and rents a two-bedroom flat in Sheffield.

The Lib Dem leader also announced the party will fight the next general election on a promise to protect education spending from children’s earliest years to the time they go to college.

Mr Clegg said that extending the existing 'ring fence' on schools spending to cover the whole of the education budget from the ages of two to 19 would cost an additional £10 billion a year, rising annually with inflation.

'Liberal Democrats will protect the full education budget, from the cradle to the college,' Mr Clegg told the Westminster news conference.

'Money invested in our children is the best investment of all because education can really transform lives. We believe education should be properly funded because education is the very core of a liberal society.'

Mr Clegg would not be drawn on whether it would be a 'die-in-the-ditch' commitment for the Lib Dems in any future coalition talks.

He said the party would spell out how it would be funded closer to the time of the general election next May. 

'My challenge to Labour and the Conservatives is if you are not going to do this, what are you going to cut? Are you going to cut money to colleges? Are you going to cut apprentices? Are you going to cut help for toddlers?

'I think it would be unimaginable for us as a country, having made these steps, to reverse them.'

Mr Clegg has promised a regular 'drumbeat' of policy announcements over the summer as his shattered party tries to rebuild support following its hammering in last month's European and English local council elections.

Mr Clegg also announced plans to protect the education budget 'from cradle to college' during the next Parliament. But the Lib Dem leader could not say how he would fund the £10 billion pledge. The move is designed to win back support lost over the failure to honour his 2010 election promise to scrap tuition fees

David Cameron and Nick Clegg sparked fury in China after meeting Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in 2012

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg this morning risked a fresh diplomatic rift with China after defending his decision to meet Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama - while also attacking the country's human right's record.

His controversial intervention, at his monthly press conference this morning, came on the first morning of a three-day visit to London by China's Premier Li Keqiang.

Mr Clegg said he had 'no regrets at all' that he met the  Dalai Lama with David Cameron in 2012. He said: 'There’s nothing in the diary for the Dalai Lama to be met by either myself or David Cameron again, but I would be more than honoured to meet him again.

'We’ve always recognised that Tibet is part of China and we equally recognise the Dalai Lama’s very important role as a highly-respected religious leader – I would hope that I can meet someone of his distinction some time in the future, but there are no government plans to do so right now.'

Mr Clegg also insisted the Government drive to increase trade with China would not stop minister criticising its human rights record.

He said: 'We remain deeply concerned about the very large scale abuses of human rights that still occur.'

The Lib Dem leader meanwhile used the opportunity to rubbish Tony Blair's claim that the current chaos in Iraq was not linked to the 2003 invasion.

He said: 'For me it’s just self-evidently not the case that you can claim that what’s happening in Iraq, never mind any other country, is separated from a massive military invasion of that country just 11 years ago.

'I find it a really peculiar reading of history that you can overlook an international invasion of another country and say it has nothing to do with the predicament that the country finds itself in now.'

Mr Clegg also announced that his party will fight the next general election on a promise to protect education spending from children's earliest years to the time they go to college.

He said that extending the existing ‘ring fence’ on schools spending to cover the whole of the education budget from the ages of two to 19 would cost an additional £10 billion a year, rising annually with inflation.

‘Liberal Democrats will protect the full education budget, from the cradle to the college,’ Mr Clegg said.

‘Money invested in our children is the best investment of all because education can really transform lives. We believe education should be properly funded because education is the very core of a liberal society.’
