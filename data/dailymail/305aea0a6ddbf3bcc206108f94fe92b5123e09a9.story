TV’s newest 'Mob Wife' has shared online pictures of herself partying in Las Vegas after telling a  judge she needed permission to travel so she could visit her son in West Virginia.

Alicia DiMichele, 40, has posted racy images to Instagram of her living it up in Sin City with her VH1 reality TV co-stars - posing in revealing swimwear, sitting in a Ferrari and hopping on a party bus.

While the terms of her $50,000 bond restrict her movements to three states, DiMichele convinced a federal judge she needed to drive her son to the University of West
Virginia 'to help him move into the dormitory'.

Plead guilty: Alicia DiMichele, seen leaving court, admitted she helped her husband, Edward 'Tall Guy' Garofalo Jr, to scam tens of thousands of dollars in union-pension funds while working for an alleged mob-tied construction firm

The wife of reputed Colombo-family 
associate Edward Garofalo Jr is awaiting sentencing for 
helping him embezzle $40,000 in Teamsters pension funds
from a Staten Island trucking company.

The mother of three told the court last year she 'agreed with my husband' to participate in the scheme.

Evidence against her includes recordings from two wiretaps and testimony of two witnesses.

Her movements have been restricted to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as part of her bond.

However in June, DiMichele filed a sworn declaration stating she needed permission to travel to visit her son. Brooklyn federal Judge Sandra Townes granted her request.

'More importantly, because my son will 
be in Morgantown, West Virginia, I need the ability to travel on very 
short notice in the event of an emergency,' she wrote.

'I do not intend to travel regularly, except to visit with my son for brief periods.'

Her lawyer John Wallenstein said: 'As far as I know, she’s home in New Jersey.'

However New York Post reports DiMichele has traveled to Vegas, with very public happy snaps showing her getting behind the wheel of a Ferrari owned by Exotics Racing, which lets people drive 'supercars' at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

DiMichele, who runs a clothing boutique called 'Addiction', faces six months in prison or house arrest.

Earlier this year, New York Daily News reported DiMichele sought permission from the Brooklyn judge to travel to Los Angeles to buy clothes fore her business.
