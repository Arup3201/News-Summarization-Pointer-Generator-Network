After numerous retirements, unretirements and a federal indictment, Roger Clemens is returning to baseball - at the tender age of 50.

Clemens, who was acquitted of several charges of lying to Congress in June, signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the independent Atlantic League on Monday.

He is slated to start for the minor league team on Saturday at home against Bridgeport.

'His fastball was clocked at 87 mph; all of his pitches were working,' said Randy Hendricks, Clemens' agent. 'He threw a three-inning simulated game after an extensive workout warm-up.'

Clemens and Skeeters manager Gary Gaetti have been talking about this 'for months,' Hendricks said.

Gaetti, who's only four years older than Clemens, is also a former major leaguer.

Javier Bracamonte, who caught Clemens' workout for the Skeeters, told KRIV: 'He's in such great shape, it's ridiculous. He's the same guy he was before.

'He is nasty. His split is good. He still has life. He was throwing in the high 80s.'

Clemens is expected to appear at a press conference scheduled for 
Tuesday morning at Constellation Field in Sugarland to make the signing 
official.

His return to the mound comes after years of speculation that marred his career.

Clemens was accused of using using steroids and HGH during his playing career in the 2007 Mitchell Report on drugs and baseball.

Appearing before Congress at a deposition months later, he denied the charge. His denial led lawmakers to pursue perjury charges against him.

But in a 'he said, he said' battle with accuser and former trainer Brian McNamee, Clemens triumphed, and was acquitted in June of charges he lied to Congress.

He hasn't played for a team since pitching for the Yankees in 2007 at the age of 45. He went 6-6 in 18 games with a 4.18 ERA that season.

Clemens had two great seasons with the Astros after he turned 40, going 18-4 with a 2.98 ERA in 2004 to win his record-tying seventh Cy Young Award. He was 13-8 with a career-low 1.87 ERA in 2005.

Clemens earned $160million and won 354 games in a 24-year career with the Red Sox, Yankees, Blue Jays and Astros.

His 4,672 strikeouts are third-most all-time and he was named to 11 All-Star games.

Now he'll see what he has left for the Skeeters, who play in the Atlantic League.

He joins a roster that includes former major league pitchers Tim Redding and Scott Kazmir and Jason Lane, a teammate of Clemens' on Houston's 2005 World Series team.

It isn't clear how long Clemens will pitch for the Skeeters.

Hendricks said: 'This is a one game at a time thing. Let's see how he does on Saturday.'

Clemens is set to appear on the Hall of Fame ballot going to voters late this year; if he appeared in a major league game his Hall consideration would be pushed back five years.

The Justice Department began an investigation concerning whether Clemens had lied under oath, and in 2010 a grand jury indicted him on two counts of perjury, three counts of making false statements and one count of obstructing Congress when he testified.

He was acquitted of all the charges on June 19 after a 10-week trial and has largely stayed out of the public spotlight until now.

The signing was first reported by Houston television station KRIV.
