The Pope says people 'cannot insult the faith of others', adding that he would punch someone if they offended his mother, as he debated freedom of speech in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

The Pontiff said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not purposely anger religious people.

Speaking on board the papal plane on his way to the Philippines, he also insisted that it was an 'aberration' to kill in the name of God and that religion can never be used to justify violence.

By way of example, Pope Francis referred to Alberto Gasparri, who organises papal trips and was standing by his side aboard the papal plane. 

'If my good friend Dr Gasparri says a curse word against my mother, he can expect a punch,' Francis said, throwing a pretend punch his way. 

'It's normal. You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others. You cannot make fun of the faith of others.' 

Following the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, many people have defended the satirical magazine for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

But the Pope said there was a limit to free speech when it concerned offending someone's religious beliefs.

He said: 'There are so many people who speak badly about religions or other religions, who make fun of them, who make a game out of the religions of others.

'They are provocateurs. And what happens to them is what would happen to Dr Gasparri if he says a curse word against my mother. There is a limit.'

In the wake of the Paris attacks, the Vatican has sought to downplay reports that it is a potential target for Islamic extremists, saying it is being vigilant but has received no specific threat.

The Pope said he was concerned primarily for the faithful, and said he had spoken to Vatican security officials who are taking 'prudent and secure measures'.

'I am worried, but you know I have a defect: a good dose of carelessness. I'm careless about these things,' he said. 

But he admitted that in his prayers, he had asked that if something were to happen to him that 'it doesn't hurt, because I'm not very courageous when it comes to pain. I'm very timid'.

'I'm in God's hands,' he added.

Pope Francis' comments came amid heightened security in the Philippines as the Pontiff starts his five-day tour of the nation.

Around 50,000 soldiers and police officers were among the throngs of people lining the streets of Manila today to welcome the Pope on his first visit to Asia's largest Catholic nation.

The huge security operation follows two previous assassination of Popes in the Philippines.

In 1970, a Bolivian artist dressed as a priest tried to stab
Pope Paul VI when he arrived at Manila airport.

In 1995, a group of Islamist militants conspired to
assassinate Pope John Paul II in Manila, a plan uncovered by
police after an accidental fire in the militants' rented apartment. 

The streets were packed with people in Manila, where a world record papal crowd is expected later this week

Snipers will be positioned at key points around Manila and Tacloban City during the pope's visit, and sniffer dogs will check sites he is due to visit.

Asked if he was nervous ahead of the Pope's arrival, Philippine National Police spokesman Senior Superintendent Wilben Mayor said: 'For a long time now, yes. This is very challenging for the PNP.'

Meanwhile police officers caught taking selfies during the Pope's visit were warned they would be fired. 

The PNP sent a memo to all staff warning them that selfies taken on duty in places Pope Francis visits are not allowed.

All 25,000 officers were sent the message reminding them not to take photographs as the Pope arrived in Manila.

On Wednesday, President Benigno Aquino personally inspected
motorcade routes and public venues, which were lined with
black-and-white concrete barriers topped by thick wire mesh to
control eager crowds.

Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas said Aquino was willing to
serve as Francis' 'personal bodyguard' to ensure his safety. 

In
a televised address on Monday, Aquino appealed to Filipinos to
follow security rules after two people were killed in a stampede
during a religious procession on Friday.

Pope Francis landed in Manila earlier today and waved to crowds gathered at the airport as he stepped out of the plane. 

He hugged two children both abandoned by their parents, who gave him bouquets of white and yellow flowers.

'I wish the Pope will bless me so that my mother will come back to us,' one of the children, 9-year-old Lani Ortilla, said before the Pope arrived. 

'We hope the Pope gives us blessings so that Filipinos can change for the better.' 

Thousands greeted the Pope with dances and cheers as he was driven through the capital in the Popemobile.

The 78-year-old Pontiff will visit the central province of Leyte, which is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan that killed 6,300
people in 2013. 

About two million people are expected to attend
an open-air mass on Saturday at Tacloban City airport, almost
completely destroyed by Haiyan.

In Manila, around six million people will hear
Francis say Mass in a park on
Sunday, eclipsing Pope John Paul II's record crowd of five million in 1995. 

The government has declared a three-day public holiday to
clear traffic in Manila, a city of 12 million people, and has closed financial markets.
