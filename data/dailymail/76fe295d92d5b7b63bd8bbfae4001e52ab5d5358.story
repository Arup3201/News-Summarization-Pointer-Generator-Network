When designing the home, the owners refused to skimp on the fixtures and fittings which include ancient heart pine floors, custom cabinets, trim, and millwork. Yet it remains a mystery why the owners have chosen never to live in it

Fine Jerusalem limestone was used to make all the exterior columns, railings, and trim, and the grand saltwater pool and patio area makes for a dramatic setting for outdoor entertaining.

Upholding its southern tradition, the home doesn't fall short on verandas with upper level private ones, sweeping lower level verandas and more tucked in between to capture the enticing landscape, states TopTenRealEstateDeals.
