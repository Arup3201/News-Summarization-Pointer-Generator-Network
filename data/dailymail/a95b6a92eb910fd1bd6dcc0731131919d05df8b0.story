Two young Japanese girls left their shoes side by side high up on an apartment building then jumped to their deaths in a joint suicide that has shocked the country.

The elementary schoolgirls, aged 11 and 12, made the fatal leap from between the seventh and eight floors of the building in Tokyo’s Ota Ward, leaving residents around the nation asking: Why?

Police said the youngsters had left a suicide note with their neatly-laid- out shoes, but declined to reveal its contents.

'The note is a matter for the parents - it is personal,’ said a police spokesman.

Police said the 11-year-old lived with her family in the apartment building, while her 12-year-old classmate lived nearby.

Two schoolgirls jumped to their death from this apartment building in Tokyo, Japan

Baffled school officials told the Japan Times newspaper that the girls had attended school on Friday and had apparently got on well with their classmates.

'There had been no incidents of bullying or anything like that,’ said a school official.

'They were in the same class and appeared to get on well with everyone.’

Their classmates said the girls were both bright and considered as leaders among their friends.

‘They did not show any signs of being worried about anything,’ said a school friend.

After removing their shoes the girls jumped, one dying instantly when they hit the asphalt parking lot near the entrance to the building. The other child died shortly afterwards.

Shocked Japanese families have taken to newspaper comment sites and social media to ask how two young girls with everything to live for should have made such a fatal decision to die together.

Friends of the girls said they noticed nothing unusual about the pair at school and they had not been bullied

‘How do you possibly comment on this?’ asked one writer. ‘Just lost for words.’

Another asked: ‘What can be so wrong in a 11-12 year old's life to end it like this?’

‘What was wrong with the lives of two young girls to make them want to kill themselves,’ questioned another writer.

‘I hate to think what they must have suffered to the point they thought jumping off a building was the best thing to do,’ remarked one writer. ‘They were failed by the adults around them.’

A report by the World Health Organisation ranks the suicide rate in Japan as fourth among high-income countries.

The report found that in 2012, when the latest statistics were compiled, Japan had 29,442 suicides that year behind South Korea, Lithuania and Russia.

Many of the deaths, WHO reported, were among people aged 70 and over.
