Sir Alex Ferguson will resist the temptation to hit back at Roy Keane in print over the infamous bust-up that led to the Irishman leaving Manchester United under a cloud in November 2005.

Keane has re-opened their war of words in his explosive new autobiography The Second Half in which he refers to Ferguson as ‘f****** p****’ over the incident.

Coincidentally, the second instalment of the former United manager's autobiography, which was published last year, is being updated and released in paperback on October 23.

However, sources at publishers Hodder & Stoughton say Ferguson will not be adding to his existing account of the rift with Keane.

The additional chapter will focus on the year that followed his retirement as United manager and David Moyes’s ill-fated spell as his successor.

Ferguson and Keane both describe how their relationship began to turn sour during a pre-season trip to Portugal, organised by Carlos Queiroz in the summer of 2005.

Keane became embroiled in a row with United's Portuguese former No 2 and recalls: ‘Ferguson tried to intervene. 

'“That’s enough. I’ve had enough of all this”,’ he said. Keane retorted: “You as well gaffer. We need f*****g more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We’re slipping behind other teams”.’

It came to a head when Keane criticised his team-mates in an interview for MUTV, which never aired. He was swiftly shown the door after being summoned to a meeting with Ferguson and then chief executive David Gill.

‘I said to Ferguson, “Can I play for somebody else?”,’ Keane writes. ‘And he said, “Yeah you can, cos we’re tearing up your contract”. So I thought, all right – I'll get fixed up.

‘I knew there’d be clubs in for me when the news got out. I said, “Yeah, I think we have come to the end”. I just thought, “F*****g p***k” – and I stood up and went, “Yeah. I’m off”.’

Keane returned to United some time later and said sorry to Ferguson but now wishes he hadn’t. ‘Afterwards, I was thinking, “I’m not sure why I f*****g apologised.” I just wanted to do the right thing.’

He also portrays Ferguson as a cold-hearted character and rates Brian Clough as a better manager for his career.

‘I worked under two great managers and I put Brian Clough ahead of Alex Ferguson for a simple reason. What was the most important thing in my football career? Brian Clough signing me. That kick started everything.

‘Different managers, both brilliant. I think Clough’s warmth was genuine, but with Ferguson it was pure business – everything is business.

‘If he was being nice I would think, “This is business, this.” He was driven and ruthless. That lack of warmth was his strength. United was a much bigger club than [Nottingham] Forest, but his coldness made him successful.’
