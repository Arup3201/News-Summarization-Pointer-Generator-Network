It's definitely not something you'd want to whip out of your hand luggage  on a flight with your parents or, in fact, anywhere for that matter.

Rolling Luggage, a leading airport retailer of branded luggage, is offering customers the chance to own an eye mask that states: 'I sleep with strangers'.

The controversial phrase is stamped on the mask in bold white capital letters and has a graphic of a person next to some seats on an airplane.

Poor taste: Rolling Luggage sells 'I sleep with strangers' eye mask for £14.99 described as 'tongue in cheek'

While users might need to worry what kind of attention it will attract, a spokesperson for the company describes is as 'tongue in cheek' and useful 'to add a bit of fun for those who like to snooze on planes, trains or the Piccadilly Line'.

However, not everyone is a fan. Travel writer Jayne Gorman, editor of blog GirlTweetsWorld.com, said: 'It's not something I would feel comfortable wearing. 

'As a solo female traveller one of the most awkward parts of flying is trying to sleep in a confined space next to someone you met just minutes before. I'm not sure drawing attention to that fact helps anyone - even if it is meant to be funny.'

A spokesperson from Rolling Luggage said: 'We stock a number a number of accessories to suit the needs and tastes of different travellers. For many people, travel accessories are a way to brighten up journeys and are often bought as gifts for globe-trotters.

The mask is described as being soft, lightweight and able to block out light and features a Velcro strap

'This Flight 001 eye mask is popular for its light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek humour and its bright, bold design. The wider range includes luggage tags, travel pouches and adaptors, in a range of colours and styles.'

The mask is described as being soft, lightweight and able to block out light. It also features a 'comfortable' wide elastic strap with a velcro closure. It will set you back £14.99. 

Fashion stylist Marie Fiorin wrote on her blog marilicious.com that she loved the eye mask. 

She said: 'I’m obsessed! 'Love love love this sleeping mask, OMG it is hilarious. This is for sure part of my travel essentials!

'Do you sleep with strangers lol?'
