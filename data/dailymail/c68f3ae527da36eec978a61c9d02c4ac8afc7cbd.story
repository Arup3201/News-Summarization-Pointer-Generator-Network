Arrest: Damarius Wren has been charged with murdering flight attendant Decarol Deloney-Cain

An 18-year-old has been charged with murdering his girlfriend's mother after Indiana police found a GPS system pinpointing where the body was dumped.

Damarius Rashard Wren was charged on Friday with killing Decarol Deloney-Cain, whose body was found stabbed, bound and left in the trunk of her car on Monday.

The 54-year-old flight attendant's body had to be identified through the serial number in her breast implants.

When police searched the victim's home they found traces of blood, stains, and red duct tape similar to that used to bound the hands and feet of Deloney-Cain.

Police were allegedly contacted by the victim's teenage daughter, who said she had found a bloody wrench in the basement bedroom of her home.

A GPS system was also found in the home, which police reports said showed directions to where the woman's body had been left in Gary.

When police questioned Wren he allegedly gave two differing accounts of how he found the body of his girlfriend's mother.

The
 victim's daughter, who has not been identified, later claimed that Wren
 had attacked her mother when she returned home on July 3.

She alleged that Wren put a pillowcase over Deloney-Cain's head and hit her head against the stairs, before stabbing her with a kitchen knife, according to court records seen by My Fox Memphis.

A coroner said Deloney-Cain, who had three children, suffered multiple stab wounds and blunt force trauma to the head.

The records state that the girl hid upstairs and later saw two of Wren's friends arrive and help carry the body to a car in plastic bags.

She 
claimed that she got in a car driven by one of the men and followed 
behind the vehicle her mother's body was in, and watched as it was left 
on a dirt road.

The
 court report states that she then withdrew cash from her mother's bank 
account, while being threatened with a gun, out of fear of what Wren and
 his friends may do to her.

The daughter is not facing any charges.

Deloney-Cain,
 who worked as a flight attendant for United Airlines, was not reported 
missing until Monday when she failed to turn up for work. She often 
worked on international flights and would be away for a couple of days 
at a time.

Deloney-Cain's brother, Todd, praised the police team behind the investigation.

'I do commend the Gary Police Department for coming up with charges as quick as they did,' he told NBC Chicago.

Wren is being held without bond, and police say more charges could be brought in the case.
