Nick Clegg’s fiercest Liberal Democrat critic has suggested he should be ousted because his personal ratings are as bad as Labour’s least successful leader Michael Foot.

Lord Oakeshott warned the Lib Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election even if picks up slightly in the polls, adding: ‘It’s nothing personal, you’ve got to look at the facts.’

And in a fresh blow for Mr Clegg, his party has slumped to just eight per cent in the polls with voters saying the animal he most resembles is a poodle.

Dog days: Under fire: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is accused of holding back his party with his own unpopularity, with 15 per cent of people saying he resembled a poodle

The YouGov survey for The Sun put Labour on 38 per cent and the Tories 34 per cent. UK Independence Party is on 13 per cent.

The survey found 21 per cent think the Lib Dems are untrustworthy, and 44 per cent say the party has not contributed 'anything positive'.

Asked which animal he most resembles, 15 per cent said a poodle, 13 per cent a labrador,, sheep 13 per cent and 11 per cent a snake.

Lord Oakshott, a close ally of Business Secretary Vince Cable, said next year’s local and Euro elections would be ‘crunch time’ as the biggest test of public opinion since 2010.

He said next May would be a ‘last chance’ for the Lib Dems to change direction.

Lord Oakeshott’s intervention will exasperate Mr Clegg’s allies, coming just days before the party gathers for its annual conference in Glasgow.

The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday that an economic ‘dawn appears to be breaking’ - something that he claimed would not have happened had it not been for the Lib Dems.

He told LBC radio he was ‘very proud’ of sticking with the coalition and helping to ‘pilot the economy through its darkest hour’.

‘You shouldn’t be complacent but it is moving in the right direction and I don’t think that would’ve happened if we hadn’t been there,’ Mr Clegg said.

Cheers: Lord Oakeshott used the interview on the eve of the Lib Dem conference to again call for Mr Clegg to resign

There are growing tensions in the Lib
Dems between those who want to start distancing themselves from the 
Tories in the run up to the 2015 general election, and those who think 
they must stick the course and seek to claim equal credit for the 
Government’s achievements.

Senior Lib Dem minister David Laws this week insisted the coalition would continue ‘up to the wire’ before the election.

But
Lord Oakeshott, in a provocative interview with political magazine The 
House, said that would lead to disaster and insisted the Lib Dems should
split from their Tory coalition partners as soon as May next year in an
attempt to convince voters they have a clear policy agenda of their 
own.

He said Mr Clegg’s personal poll 
ratings were ‘very poor’ and the party would have to think about whether
it would do better under another leader.

‘We need to face facts, there’s quite a
lot of complacency going on and self-delusion going on. We are likely 
to lose seats,’ he said.

‘If we are on 15 per cent we would 
hold 30 seats, if we are on 17 per cent we would hold 40 seats - and if 
we are on 13 per cent we would hold 20 seats.... It’s very important to 
maximise our national share of the vote to give our MPs the best 
chance.’

Lord Oakeshott, who revealed in the interview that he and his wife are worth £10 million, said the party’s poll ratings were currently stuck between 8 per cent and 10 per cent with ‘no sign of improvement’.

‘Let’s be objective; we have to accept that Nick’s ratings are very poor and have been for a long time. You’ve got to be frank that his ratings are down at levels which if you go back were only seen by Mrs Thatcher shortly before she left, and Michael Foot. It’s nothing personal, you’ve got to look at the facts,’ he said.

State of the parties

Britain’s most expensive homes should 
be hit with a ‘super mansion tax’ to help raise billions in tax 
revenues, according to a senior Liberal Democrat.

The
party already advocates a 1 per cent tax on homes worth more than 
£2million, but party president Tim Farron said those worth more should 
face an even higher rate.

He
said yesterday: ‘You could have various rates within the mansion tax. A
£4million property, for example, paying a higher rate.’

A
tax on expensive properties is also backed by the Labour Party.

Mr Farron told the Evening Standard he wanted
to charge people who had properties and wealth at much more than 
£2million 'a higher proportion' instead of lowering the threshold to 
catch more properties.

He
said: 'You
could have various rates within the mansion tax - a property worth 
£4million, for example, paying at a higher rate, as well as a higher 
global sum, than those with smaller properties.

’There is a way of doing this without damaging people who are potentially in a more marginal position.'

‘You do have to say “where are our 
prospects at the next election if we don’t have a major and clear change
and detachment from the Conservatives?” and we’ve got to think about 
the best way to get that message over.’

The peer pointed to polls last year which suggested the party could add about three or four points to its ratings under another leader, adding: ‘These are things people have to think about given how sensitive the number of our seats will be. It’s for the party to decide.

‘It’s disastrous if we are seen as a tin can tied to the Tories’ tail in 2015. We have to move on to developing our own very clear and distinctive Liberal Democrat message for next time.

‘It will be very difficult to do that if we are still in Government at the next election. I believe we should disengage well before the next election, sixth months to a year before.’

A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘Nobody 
who has ever spoken to Matthew will be surprised to learn that he 
doesn’t like Nick Clegg and that he enjoys talking about how rich he is.

‘This is a predictable annual 
occurrence. He last called for Nick Clegg to resign at conference in 
2012. You can set your calendar by it. Having a dig at Nick gives 
Matthew his occasional moment in the sun.’

Mr Cable said: ‘Matthew is an independent minded member of the House of Lords, with his own views.

'He does not speak for me. His comments today were seriously unhelpful.’

Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb acknowledged that the party had ‘a lot of hard work to do’ and ‘you’d rather the polls were better than they are’.

But he added: ‘I’ve seen us recover from worse than this and incumbency is important. We’ve got a lot of work to do and we know we’ve got to get our message across and in coalition it’s a unique challenge to be distinctive.’
