He is known as the 'mystery artist' at his local pub because he often draws on their blackboard menu for fun.

Now 16-year-old Jack Magee's name could become far more widely known after he won this year's British Cartoonists' Association's (BCA) Young Cartoonist of the Year competition.

His cartoon, inspired by the discovery of Richard III's skeleton under a Leicester car park, tickled and impressed the judges, beating hundreds of other entries to the title in the under 18 age group. It shows the 15th century king buying a ticket for '500 years' from a pay and display machine.

Impressive: Schoolboy Jack Magee's winning entry in the under-18 Young Cartoonist of the Year competition was inspired by the discovery of Richard III's skeleton under a Leicester car park

Yesterday talented schoolboy Jack said: 'It only took me about 45 minutes to do.

'I'd like to get into this as a career and we're getting to that stage in school where they're trying to push us into job choices. I have suggested being a cartoonist and I don't think the teachers hear that very often.'

The artistic endeavours of Jack, a pupil at Earlston High School in the Scottish Borders, have previously been mainly appreciated by regulars and staff at the Buccleuch Arms, near his home in Melrose.

He takes chalks in with him on meals out there with his parents and draws cartoons on their menu blackboard. The pub's owners have been so impressed with his work they started photographing them and posting them on the pub's Facebook page, dubbing him the 'mystery artist'.

Jack's parents Maggie and Alain, both 52 and conservation advisers, say he has been 'drawing since before he was walking'.

Mrs Magee said: 'He picked up a pen when he was a baby and started drawing on the back of an envelope. He's been doing it ever since and has been known to draw on napkins in restaurants too.'

Past masters: Previous winners of the competition in Jack's age group include 2009 champion Nick Edwards, who went on to win an Emmy for his work on animated television series Uncle Grandpa (pictured)

Venue: Jack and his fellow competition winners will be presented with their £250 prizes and certificates at the Cartoon Museum on Wednesday

Previous winners of the competition in Jack's age group include Nick Edwards, in 2009. In inspiring news for Jack and all aspiring young cartoonists, 24-year-old Mr Edwards' career has taken off since and he won an Emmy in August for 'outstanding individual achievement in animation' as a character designer for an episode of the American animated television series Uncle Grandpa.

This year's under 30 age group in the BCA's Young Cartoonist of the Year was won by James Hunter, 26, a graphic designer from East London, who entered a cartoon of a man shooting himself with a 'bang' flag gun.

He said: 'Like many of these things, I just drew it and showed it to a few friends who liked it. I was absolutely stunned to hear that it won. I've been drawing most my life but have only been submitting cartoons to magazines for about a year and have yet to be published.'

A third prize, awarded in memory of former Private Eye cartoonist Kevin Woodcock, went to Sean Coen, 28, a receptionist and postroom worker, of Camden, London, for his 'Thought I'd upload all this **** to the icloud' cartoon.

The judges in the annual competition were the cartoonists from nearly every national daily newspaper, including the Daily Mail's incomparable Mac, and Oliver Preston, chairman of the Cartoon Museum in London, whose work has appeared in publications ranging from The Field to The Spectator.

The winners will be presented with their £250 prizes and certificates at the Cartoon Museum on Wednesday.
