The men who kidnapped Carlos Tevez's father told him that they wanted the Argentina star to forgive them for what they had done.

Segundo Tevez was freed after an eight-hour ordeal in Buenos Aires when the Juventus striker paid a £30,000 ransom to have him released.

But Tevez Senior revealed that his kidnappers were apologetic over their actions. According to the Daily Mirror, Segundo told the police that the gang said: 'Carlos is our idol. He's the greatest there is. We don't want to hurt him. Why would we?

'The problem is we've got children and we need the money. We haven't got any alternative. We hope he forgives us.'

The kidnappers, who are still being hunted by local police, also told Segundo that they were upset when Tevez was left out of Alejandro Sabella's World Cup squad.

Tevez's father was snatched by the assailants at around sunrise on Tuesday morning but was 'in good shape' after being released, 
according to the family's lawyer Gustavo Galasso.

Argentine
 TV station C5N said Tevez was set free after a payment of 40,000 pesos 
(£30,000) but neither the family nor the police confirmed this.

The former Manchester United and Manchester City striker was given permission by Juventus to leave Italy but reports there said he was not going back to Argentina following news of the release.

La Nacion
 in Argentina reported that Tevez was driving his car in the 
municipality of Moron, a province of Buenos Aires, when he was taken 
hostage in the early hours.

CCTV footage shows the gang stalking Segundo's car before forcing him out of the vehicle at gunpoint. They decided to kidnap him after looking at his ID and realising he was the father of the former Premier League star.

Tevez was adopted by his maternal aunt and her husband, Segundo Tevez, as a baby.
