Jeb Bush sounded more like his older brother than himself on Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, winning over many conservative activists in what is known as hostile terrority for political moderates like him. 

Mixing jokes with firm policy positions, the former Florida governor ditched the wooden posture that earned him low marks during recent speeches in Detroit and Chicago, stepping out from behind a podium and engaging in 20 minutes of one-on-one with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity.

Bush tackled head-on the two subject that have made him an object of scorn on the Republican Party's right wing – immigration policy and so-called 'Common Core' national education standards. 

Talk of a protest walkout by disaffected right-wingers never materialized beyond a handful of attendees heading to the exits after a stemwinder by the president of the National Rifle Association.

THIRD BUSH IN LINE: Jeb would join his father and brother as White House occupants if he were to seize the brass ring in 2016

SPRING IN HIS STEP: Bush won friends among conservatives by talking to the audience instead of reading from prepared remarks

The Common Core standards have aroused loud protests on the right, and Bush laid out his support for the plan in November saying 'the rigor of Common Core state standards must be the new minimum in classrooms.'

But on Friday he sought to distance himself from that statement and seemed to sympathize with the abti-Big-Government crowd gathered near the nation's capital. 

'With this president and this Department of Education,' Bush allowed, 'there's a risk that they will intrude, and they have,' on the states.

Republicans, he said, should insist taht 'the federal government has no role in the creation of standards, either directly or indirectly.'

He also said the party must demand that Washington stay out of local schools' curriculum decisions and keep its hands off information collected for student ID cards.

But the idea of raising the bar for education standards and requiring schools to prove they are meeting them, he insisted, is sound.

'If there's no consequence between mediocrity and failure, or excellence, then the system won't move forward,' Bush said.

The immigration mess Bush finds himself in is thornier. in April 2014 he said at an event marking the 15th anniversary of his father's presidency that many illegal immigrants cross America's southern border with good intentions.

'Someone who comes to our country because they couldn’t come legally, they come to our country because their families – the dad who loved their children – was worried that their children didn’t have food on the table,' he said. 

'And they wanted to make sure their family was intact, and they crossed the border because they had no other means to work to be able to provide for their family. Yes, they broke the law, but it’s not a felony. It’s an act of love. It’s an act of commitment to your family.' 

Conservative voters remember this and many booed Bush in anticipation of a smackdown when Hannity read the words back to him. The catcalls tripled in volume when Bush was reinded that he had green-lighted lower college tuition – the rates paid by students who live in Florida – for illegal immigrants attending state-run universities.

'For those who made an ‘oo’ sound – is that what it was?' he asked with a grin. 

'I’m marking you down as neutral and I want to be your second choice.' 

The boos mixed with some cheers when Bush laid out his position more unapologetically.

'There is no plan to deport 11 million people,' he said. 'We should give them a path to legal status' provided that 'they don't break the law, they learn English and they make a contribution to society.' 

HOT-BUTTONS: Immigration and Commone Core education standards are stumbling blocks for Bush but he explained his positions and didn't back down

That position distinguishes him from most other Republicans in the hunt for the presidency, most of whom castigated the Obama White House for an 'amnesty' plan that threatens to mainstream 5 million or more people in the country illegally.

But if he were to win the tense nomination fight, his stance would be a carbon copy of what any Democrat might offer – a situation that red-meat conservatives see as a capitulation.

Bush split the difference by agreeing with the capacity crowd about President Obama's executive actions.

'The president did use authority he didn't have,' Bush said. 'The courts are going to overturn that.'

'I think the Congress ought to pass a bill that does not allow him to use that authority. ... The president has gone way beyond his constitutional powers to do this, and the Congress has every right to reinstate their responsibility for what the law is about.'

Bush is fashioning a strategy that calls for pegging the immigration fight to jobs and economic growth. On Friday the White House announced that the Amercan economy grew by 2.2 per cent in the last quarter of 2014. With a 4 per cent growth, Bush said, there would be enough jobs for everyone in the U.S., whether or not they had the legal right to work. 

He encouraged the crown not to 'believe that the pie is static – that's the left's point of view.' 

'If we grow at 4 per cent there's going to be opportunities for all.'
