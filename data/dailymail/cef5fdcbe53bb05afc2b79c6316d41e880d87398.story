Three lapdancers and their manager kidnapped a club boss after he failed to pay them more than £42,000, a court has been told.

The women had been hired to work at a pop-up nightclub to provide entertainment for customers during the Cheltenham Festival in March 2012.

Curtis Woodman, who had set up the club was driven to a 
remote field and beaten up, it was claimed.

Three lapdancers and their agent Charlotte Devaney, 34, are alleged to have enlisted the help of two male friends to strongarm him.

A court heard that Mr Woodman, 34, 
hired the girls around the time of the festival but fell out with them when he accused them of breaching
 the Embassy Club's strict licence conditions by stripping off.

Bristol Crown Court heard the club failed
 to secure a lapdancing licence and the girls signed contracts agreeing 
they would wear 'bikinis and nipple tassels at all times'.

But when the club opened some of the 
women, who were paid £150 per night to work there, 'insisted on taking 
their clothes off' and it was shut down by officials.

The
 women claimed they were promised 50 per cent of any card takings
 which included £42,000 spent by one excited punter.

In a taped police interview played to the jury, Mr Woodman said that he struggled to get the women to keep their clothes on.

'A lot of the girls earned a lot of money from working that Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.'

Mr
 Woodman said the problem between him and the girls arose on the Tuesday
 night, when a customer began spending money on his debit card.

'He was obviously a big spender, he was spending a lot of money, I mean in the region of £40,000.

'Throughout
 all of the week, we had just one night which was a full nude lapdancing
 night, the rest of the nights were running as a hostess business fully 
clothed.

'If you have ever asked a stripper to keep her clothes on when she is working, it doesn’t happen.

'I was constantly bombarding them ‘put your clothes back on we are going to get shut down’.

'You
 try and keep 60 girls in check. On the Wednesday we had a team meeting 
before we started, we told the girls to go into town and buy clothes.

Devaney
 spent months chasing Mr Woodman for the 'debt' before visiting a police
 station in Cheltenham on September 3, where she was advised to take 
civil action.

Later that 
day, Devaney, along with dancers Mandy Cool, 29, Stephanie Pye, 31, and 
Rachel Goodchild, 24, met with brothers Alexander, 23, and Robert 
Morris, 27.

The group headed to Mr 
Woodman's work in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, in two cars, where they 
'kidnapped him', the jury of seven men and five women was told.

Prosecuting, Martin Steen said: 'Miss Devaney made clear she thought that there would need to be a discussion with Mr Woodman.

'He was helped into Miss Devaney's car by the Morrises, who sat either side of him in the back of the vehicle.

'Mr Woodman was wearing a Breitling watch. It was seen by the Morrises and he was required to hand it over.

'They
 had in their possession a Stanley knife. He was under threat. He had no
 choice but to hand over that watch, worth £4,800, and he did so.'

Mr Steen said that when Alexander Morris was later arrested, the watch was found to be in his possession.

During the drive, Mr Woodman was sat in Devaney's BMW One Series with her, the Morris brothers and Stephanie Pye. Cool, in her BMW Three Series, with Goodchild, followed.

Mr Woodman was allegedly struck twice in the face by Robert Morris as the car drove onto the M5 and left at junction 10.

His phone was confiscated and attempts were made to transfer money using a banking app, which were unsuccessful, Mr Steen said.

'He was then persuaded to ring the bank and arrange for a transfer using the details of Charlotte Devaney's bank card,' he told the jury.

'£4,800 was transferred into Charlotte Devaney's account.'

Mr Woodman was then taken 100 metres down an agricultural track, where he was taken out of the vehicle by the Morris brothers, it was alleged.

'They told him they were going to have some fun,' Mr Steen said. 'That involved hitting him to the face and kicking him to the face, causing him to bleed.

'It was suggested that they should pay a visit to his parents, perhaps dealing with his parents might encourage satisfaction of the debt that was owed.'

Mr Woodman directed the vehicles to an empty property he claimed was his home - stating he had left the keys in his office - before the cars set off again.

He was then driven to a fish and chip shop and left him in the car, Mr Steen said.

'Mr Woodman was later released with threats that if he didn't pay the rest of the money, they would be back,' Mr Steen said.

Police had already been tipped off because Mr Woodman rung a business partner during the drive and they were able to trace the two BMWs.

The Morris brothers, Cool and Goodchild were arrested when Cool's BMW was stopped on the A34 in Hampshire at 8.30pm that evening.

Devaney was arrested at an address the following day, while Pye handed herself into a police station later.

Mr Steen said Devaney and the girls hatched a plan to kidnap Mr Woodman after months of chasing him for payment.

'As far as the girls were concerned, they were hoping to have their share of the credit card payment of £42,000,' Mr Steen said.

'Mr Woodman felt that the girls had broken their contracts and were not entitled to keep the money.'

Mr Steen explained the entertainment licence the club had meant the women were not allowed to provide lapdancing or stripping services, save for one day of the month.

'The contracts stated that clothes - bikinis and nipple tassels - were to be worn at all times,' Mr Steen said.

'On the Monday night, some of the girls would not adhere to the rules, they insisted on taking their clothes off. Complaints came to be made.'

On the Tuesday night, during which the £42,000 transaction was made, the club held the permitted one day of 'full entertainment', including stripping services, he said.

'On the Wednesday, police and licensing officers paid the club a visit,' he said.

'The girls were not adhering to the rules. As a result, the club was closed down.'

Earlier, Alexander Morris, from Southampton, admitted carrying a bladed article, namely a Stanley knife, on September 3, 2012, the day of the alleged kidnap.

Morris and his brother Robert, also from Southampton deny robbery of Mr Woodman's Brietling watch.

The pair are also charged with the robbery of £60 cash Mr Woodman is alleged to have given them the day before his release.

Devaney, from London; Pye, from Sutton Coldfield; Cool, of Southampton; and Goodchild, of Southampton, each deny a charge of kidnap on September 3 2012.

The trial, in front of judge Geoffrey Mercer, continues.
