Most 19-year-old boys can only dream of living a billionaire’s lifestyle of fast cars, superyachts, luxury mansions and parties with the stars.

But for tycoon’s son Rufus Caudwell, it is a nightmare that has left him housebound for years with agoraphobia.

Rufus – the son of Phones 4u founder John Caudwell – may have developed the anxiety disorder as a result of his parents’ divorce and the pressure of living in the shadow of his phenomenally successful father.

He has lived with its crippling effects since 2006, when Mr Caudwell made his fortune by selling his mobile phone empire for £1.5billion. The business made headlines earlier this week after it was forced into administration.

Rufus claims that despite being treated by experts and psychiatrists, he may never be cured so he can enjoy his father’s lifestyle.

The teenager is appearing on a television show to explain how his life has been affected by his father’s immense wealth – and by his own illness.

Speaking on Jon Richardson Grows Up on Channel 4 with his sister Libby about the luxury and opportunity Mr Caudwell’s success offers, he said: ‘We will never quite live up to dad, whatever we do. We will never quite get there.

‘We almost feel guilty that we have this. You think, “What have I done? Why do I deserve this?”. It is the luck of the draw. I just happened to be born from a certain set of parents.’

Similar concerns caused Libby, 26, to ask her 61-year-old father to cut off her allowance two years ago.

Mr Caudwell separated from Rufus’s mother Kathryn in 2001 after nearly three decades of marriage. They had three children – Rufus, Libby and their sister Rebekah.

The tycoon lives with his partner Claire Johnson and their young son Jacobi in a Grade I-listed mansion in Staffordshire and a five-storey mansion in London’s Mayfair.

He often entertains his celebrity friends and supporters of his charity for disabled youngsters, Caudwell Children, such as the Duchess of York, Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams, Joan Collins, Sir Bruce Forsyth, Elizabeth Hurley, Peter Andre and Boris Becker.

But Mr Caudwell’s star-studded lifestyle clearly intimidates Rufus. He tells comedian Richardson: ‘I can’t quite understand the life my father leads because it is so glamorous. I just sit there on Facebook in my bedroom. He is desperate for me to live this life with him and it is incredibly frustrating for him.’

Libby adds: ‘The stuff dad does! There are ski chalets and boats. Dad has got an unbelievable life and Rufus has not been to any of it.’

Agoraphobia, which affects up to 450,000 Britons, makes sufferers feel extreme anxiety in situations others take for granted, such as leaving the house or taking public transport.

It is often brought on by a traumatic experience. Professor Kevin Gournay, from the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, and the Priory Hospital, said youngsters can be affected if their parents separate or a parent is a high-flier – both of which apply to Rufus.

Professor Gournay added: ‘The stresses of divorce could trigger agoraphobia. It’s fair to say the children of parents who are in the limelight – high achievers – are often under terrific pressure to emulate their parents. That can lead to anxiety, which can lead to agoraphobia.’

For Rufus, it means days spent alone in his bedroom playing video games or using social media. Revealing how his life has been affected, he said: ‘I suffer from – and I have done for about eight or nine years – agoraphobia. Which is basically a phobia of leaving the house. That has been the biggest part of my life. At the moment it is an achievement if I can go four minutes in the car out of the house.

‘A normal day, depressingly, is devoid of much purpose. I just wake up when I want to. I will lie in bed for an hour, maybe get up and play some Xbox. There have been times when I have not been able to leave my bedroom. For the past eight years on and off that has pretty much been my life.

‘For once in his life [my father] can’t really make an impact. I have had numerous therapists, but I don’t think anyone can cure me. It is all down to me.’
