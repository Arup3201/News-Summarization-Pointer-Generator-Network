The Prime Minister has sent a clear warning to Australian citizens fighting with and supporting 'Islamic State' terror organisations in the Middle East that if they are killed by fire from Australian fighter jets, 'they took their chances'  

'It was one of the principle reasons for committing to the anti-ISIL fight, that there are Australians there in significant numbers who wish to do us harm,' Mr Abbott said.

The PM conceded that fire on Islamic jihadists from Australian fighter jets could kill those who hold Australian citizenship but have pledged their allegiance to the likes of ISIL and ISIS.

'If they are killed in conflict, they know the risks' Tony Abbott speaking on Australian citizens who have pledged their allegiance to terror groups

'These are groups and people who wage war on everything that does not conform to their particular view of the world,' he said.

'These are ideologues of a new and hideous variety who don't just do evil but they exalt in doing evil.

'If they are killed in conflict, they know the risks, they took their chances, they broke Australian law, they are doing something which is a very serious offence under Australian law.

The PM says if the likes of Australian citizens and self-proclaimed jihadists like Khaled Sharrouf (left) and Mohamed Elomar (right) are gunned down by Australian jets targeting militant groups in the Middle East,  'they took their chances'

'I say again to any Australian who might be thinking of travelling to the Middle East to join in terrorist activity - don't. It is very dangerous, it is wrong.'

There are up to 60 Australians who have been identified as fighting with terrorist groups in the Middle East.

Intelligence agencies believe at least another 100 Australians are supporting terrorist groups in the region also.

Mr Abbott also refused to extend an olive branch to any militant who might be having second thoughts, saying 'if you have involved yourself in terrorism you will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed for a very long time'.
