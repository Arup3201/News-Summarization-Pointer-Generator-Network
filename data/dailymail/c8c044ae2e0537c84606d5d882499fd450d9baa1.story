Human remains have been found on the farm that formerly belonged to a millionaire who murdered his wife, police said today.

Officers have been searching for the body of Kate Prout at the farm in Redmarley, Gloucestershire, for four days after Adrian Prout finally confessed to her murder in prison last week.

Prout, 49, had previously maintained that his wife disappeared in November 2007, but was convicted of her murder last year and is currently serving a life sentence.

Search: Police have spent the last four days searching for the remains of Mrs Prout on the Gloucestershire farm she shared with her husband Adrian, who killed her in 2007

Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson, of Gloucestershire Police, said: 'At one o'clock this afternoon we have found human remains close to the location Adrian Prout identified as the place he buried his wife.

'No formal identification has taken place; however, we have informed Kate's family of recent developments.

'I do hope that this will be the final chapter of these harrowing events for Kate's family.'

Speaking at a police cordon next to the farmland, Mr Atkinson said officers were aiming to remove the remains from the ground tonight.

Specialist dogs, trained to locate decomposed bodies, were taken to the site at Cobhill Woods along with a body deposition expert who was flown in by helicopter yesterday.

Last week, Prout led officers to an area of 300 square yards on the 276-acre Redhill Farm where he said he had buried the former teacher.

Grim: Two police cars protect the entrance to the footpath leading down to the farm. Mrs Prout's husband, Adrian, who confessed to killing her, led detectives to the spot on the 276-acre farm where he dumped her

Mr Atkinson said: 'We have been 
searching for nearly four days, and that perhaps gives you an indication
of just how tough it has been.

'Adrian
Prout has not been able to give us a precise location and that's why it
has taken so long, but it's within the area he indicated.'

Police
have used diggers and forensic archaeologists, as well as cadaver dogs 
in what police described as a 'challenging' search for Mrs Prout's body.

In a dramatic twist last week, Prout 
confessed to killing his wife and burying her body in woodland on their 
£1.2 million farm, after failing a lie detector test.

Last Friday, Prout was taken from prison to the farm in handcuffs to show police the spot where he said he dumped her.

His admission from behind bars 
comes four years after he murdered his 55-year-old wife and exactly 12 months 
since her family last pleaded with him to reveal the truth.

Prout always denied any part in her disappearance as he refused to help officers in their search for the retired teacher.

Friends had called for his release, claiming there had been a miscarriage of justice, while Prout maintained his innocence.

But he is said to have told his fiancee
Debbie Garlick that he strangled his wife after a row and buried her 
body in woodland on his farm.

Ms Garlick is believed to have subsequently spoken to Gloucestershire Police about his confession.
Prout, who has fathered a child with Ms Garlick after his wife's 
disappearance, was thought to have strangled her and then used his 
expertise as a professional pipe-layer to bury her body.

Jurors heard that Mrs Prout had confronted her husband with an increased divorce demand the day before she went missing.

He had offered her a settlement of £600,000 but, after discussion with accountants, she decided to demand £800,000.

The last time anyone heard from her was at 3.29pm on November 5, 2007, when she called her bank, First Direct.

Since then no organisations have had any contact with her, including banks and passport agencies.
Even after Prout was jailed, police continued to search Redhill Farm for his wife's remains, but failed to locate her.

On Friday Ms Garlick told ITV Westcountry of her prison visit last week: 'He just confessed.'

Ms Garlick, who had led a campaign 
proclaiming Prout's innocence, said: 'Myself and my family are obviously
devastated for the news we received.

'My heart goes out to Kate and her 
family. I hope this gives them a chance to grieve properly for their 
sister and have a proper burial and somewhere they can lay flowers.'

Ms Garlick, who was accompanied by 
her sister during the interview, was asked whether having campaigned for
her fiance's release, she was devastated at his sudden confession.

'Yeah we were, obviously, but our heart goes out still to Kate and her family,' she said.

A large cordon was formed around the area where Kate Prout's body is believed to have been buried
