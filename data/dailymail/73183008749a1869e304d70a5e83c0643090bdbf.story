Kevin Pietersen will sign a new deal with Surrey within 24 hours but will have nine Championship matches at the most to stake his claim for an England return in the first Ashes Test on July 8.

He has negotiated a release from his Indian Premier League deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad and, though he will miss the regular season, he could be summoned for the knockout stages.

This would rule Pietersen, 34, out of County Championship fixtures at Northamptonshire and Kent, starting on May 18 and 24 respectively.

Sportsmail understands the second season of his £250,000-a-year Sunrisers contract remains unaffected.

There appears to be no plan to alter his agreement to play for St Lucia Zouks in the Caribbean Premier League, which runs from June 21 to July 26.

‘I’ve never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent England, and I’m going to do everything in my power to earn a recall,’ said Pietersen.

‘To once again put on that England shirt would be a privilege but now I have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection.’

England captain Alastair Cook, who leaves next week for a three-Test tour of the West Indies, fell cheaply for the second time in the match for MCC against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. 

He made five before lofting a Jack Brooks short ball to midwicket.
