Since forging a friendship in 2001, Vladimir Putin and Silvio Berlusconi have racked up thousands of miles  jetting off to catch up with each other in a host of international locations.

The Russian president has attended parties at the Italian's infamous villa in Sardinia while Mr Putin reciprocated with holidays at his 20-bedroom dacha on the Black Sea.

Last night it was Mr Berlusconi's turn to host again, with a very late-night dinner at his Milan apartment.

Old friends: Berlusconi  waves goodbye to Putin as he leaves his Milan home. The former Italian prime minister had to persuade the judge to allow him to break the rules of his house arrest in order to meet his friend

Late-night meal:  Vladimir Putin, pictured with Berlusconi, was invited for dinner at the former Italian prime minister's Milan apartment. He was collected in a limousine at around 3.30am

Mr Putin, who was in Italy for an EU summit, arrived at the apartment of the former Italian prime minister at 1.40am, where they dined on white truffle pasta and tiramisu.

The leader put in the early morning call to his long-term ally just hours after he met with David Cameron and President Poroshenko  to discuss ending the conflict in the Ukraine.

His diplomatic blitz in Milan got off to a rocky start when he kept Angela Merkel waiting for a meeting and arrived late for a dinner with European and Asian leaders.

Mr Berlusconi, who was convicted of tax evasion last year, had to persuade the judge to allow him to break the rules of his house arrest in order to meet his old friend, according to the Times.

The scandal-mired politician, who brought his five children with him to meet the Russian leader, is usually required to be at his mansion outside Milan by 11pm. 

But he was allowed to host Mr Putin at his city residence. Mr Putin was collected from the apartment in a limousine at around 3.30am. 

Rocky start: The Russian leader, who met with David Cameron yesterday to discuss ending the conflict in Ukraine, was late for a meeting with Angela Merkel, pictured, during the Asia-EU summit yesterday

Outspoken support: The pair, pictured on a yacht in 2003, have been public in their support of each other's political approaches. Last night they dined on white truffle pasta and tiramisu

Just four hours later, Putin arrived for a meeting with President Poroshenko of Ukraine, attended by David Cameron, to discuss the conflict in the Ukraine.   

Last year, Mr Putin visited Berlusconi at his residence in Rome and was photographed throwing a ball for Dudu, the poodle belonging to Berlusconi's girlfriend. 

They have also attended extreme fighting events together and Mr Putin even has a bed named after him at the 77-year-old billionaire’s mansion. 

Light-hearted: Putin and Berlusconi were pictured wearing enormous Russian fur hats in 2003. Putin has also hosted Mr Berlusconi at his 20-bedroom dacha on the Black Sea

And their firm friendship has translated to outspoken political support for each other. 

In 2009, the US ambassador to Italy wrote in a leaked memo that Berlusconi admired 'Putin's macho, decisive and authoritarian governing style'. 

For his part, Mr Putin defended Berlusconi when he was tried for paying a minor for sex, claiming he that he would have had fewer problems if he had been gay.
