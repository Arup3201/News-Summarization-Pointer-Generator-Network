Rihanna is suing her former accountant after she claims he advised her to make a string of bad financial decisions which lost the star $9million in one year.

The Barbadian singer, real name Robyn Fenty, claims she was 'effectively bankrupt' at the end of 2009 after advice from accountant Peter Gounis of Berdon LLP, according to new legal documents filed at Manhattan federal court.

Rihanna says in the lawsuit that she had $11million in cash in January 2009 but just $2million left at the end of the year - mainly because her accountant told her to buy a Beverly Hills mansion for $7.5million which turned out to be moldy and leaking.

The singer also saw her expenses double at this time, according to recent documents filed as part of the 2012 lawsuit, the Daily News reported. 

The 25-year-old, who is now worth $43million, said that Mr Gounis told her she could afford to purchase the home when she was actually running out of cash.

The trouble-ridden mansion ended up having to be sold at a $2million loss.

The court papers said: 'Mr Gounis was fully apprised of Ms Fentyâ€™s financial condition, yet, nonetheless, failed to advise her that the purchase would be unwise.'

Rihanna also claims it is her 
accountant's fault for failing to warn her that her Last Girl On Earth 
tour would not turn a profit. She fired Berdon LLP in 2010.

Rhianna is suing Mr Gounis for gross mismanagement.

Thomas Manisero, a lawyer for Berdon 
LLP, told the Daily News that the allegations were false. MailOnline was
 awaiting a comment from Mr Manisero today.

Mr Gounis said that the singer squandered huge amounts of money on designer clothes and jewellery.

According to the Daily News, he wrote: 'At the core of her claim is this belief: someone else is responsible for her conduct and its consequences.'

Rocky financials was not Rihanna's only problem in 2009. Her money worries came around the time she was dating rapper Chris Brown.

In February 2009, Brown assaulted Rihanna, leaving her unconscious after he choked her. A leaked photograph from the LAPD showed the extent of her brutal injuries.

Four months later, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and received five years along with a restraining order which was later lifted.
