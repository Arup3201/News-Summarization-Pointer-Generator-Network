Radicalised Australian children, as young as six, have been shown calling for an end to democracy and Australia’s way of life in a shocking extremist video.

Four children, reportedly aged 6 to 13, claim that they want American President Barack Obama to go to hell and chant ‘O Bashar we want your head,’ about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in a video that was unearthed by Channel Seven.

The disturbing footage was filmed at an event held by The Muslim Youth Project and is thought to have happened in December last year.

The young people sing ‘until Islam there is no rest’, as they wave Islamic flags.

And the smallest states: ‘You’re never too young to be a Soldier of Khilafah.’

Two bearded men flank the boys as the sing and Channel Seven has identified the man leading the chant as Bilal Merh, a senior figure in the radical group Hizb ut Tahrir.

Back in 2011, Merhi urged Australians to join shun moderate forms of Islam and reject democracy during a Khilafah Conference in Australia, called Uprising In The Muslim World… on the road to Khilafah.

He spoke to around 100 people on behalf of the radical Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is trying to create a caliphate in the Middle East.

The group tells Muslims in Australia that they too should reject democracy.

The Muslim Youth Project, which has another event coming up on Saturday which only men are invited too, says on its Facebook page that it aims to ‘engage with young Muslims of all ages and on all levels to discuss the issues that really matter to us’.

‘We hold various regular gatherings (fortnightly), events and initiatives (for brothers) that are engaging and interactive.

‘Islam is the project of all Muslims, and young Muslims are particularly capable of carrying the message of Islam, with their plentiful zeal and energy,’ the page says.

After Channel Seven aired the video, Uthman Badar, Hizb ut-Tahrir’s spokesperson, took to Twitter to call the report a ‘beat up’ and the producers ‘simpletons’.

‘Memo to simpletons at Ch. 7 "breaking" another beat-up tonight: the black flag with white shahada script & vice-versa have been around and used by Muslims long before ISIS. It is not an "ISIS flag". Don't let facts get in the way of more Islamophobic sensationalism tho [sic],’ he wrote.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Muslim Youth Project for comment.

Monash University terror expert Professor Greg Barton told Daily Mail Australia that as the video was filmed last year - before new terror laws were brought in - charges against those involved in the video will probably not be laid.

However, he warned that Hizb ut-Tahir wouldn't get away with the same rhetoric in Australia now.

Hizb ut-Tahrir calls itself a global Islamic political party. It is known for its extreme ideologies 

Badar said on Twitter that the flags in the video were not ISIS flags because they were used before ISIS used them

‘The group involved is always vocal on grabbing headlines and staying on the right side of the law… the new terror legislation would give them trouble now.

‘It used to be about a fictional caliphate but now it is actually being fought for in the Middle East,’ he added.

Professor Barton highlighted that ‘apart from anything else this is about bad parenting’.

‘It happens with every community group group, parents doing dumb things with their kids, whether its fire arms, drugs or alcohol, it’s reckless idiot parenting but from a small section of the Australian Muslim society,’ he said.

Professor Barton said extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir always ensure they stay on just the right side of the law so that they don’t get banned.

‘If we respond to them we make them look more legitimate and give them the high ground,’ Professor Barton warned.

The video of the young radicalised Australian children emerged days after 17-year-old Australian Abdullah Elmir appeared in an ISIS video rant against western society last week. He left the country in June to join the terrorist group who are fighting in Syria and Iraq.

The Sydney teenager gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in a YouTube video.
