An 18-year-old, who at the time was a student at one of New Zealand's most distinguished boys' schools,  has been convicted of filming his friends have sex with a drunk girl at a party.

In New Plymouth District Court on Tuesday Jack Greenslade was sentenced to a 12-hour curfew from 7pm for the next four months, 150 hours of community work and was ordered to pay the female victim $5000 emotional harm reparation, writes Taranaki Daily News.

Greenslade pleaded guilty on November 14, 2013  to a charge of making an intimate visual recording.

Meanwhile, one of the teen offender's friends is facing two charges of unlawful sexual connection and one each of rape, indecent assault and making an intimate visual recording.

The other alleged offender is charged with rape, unlawful sexual connection and indecent assault.

All three were, at the time, students at New Plymouth Boys School in Taranaki, New Zealand.

The Crown summary of facts states that Greenslade was sober on the night and not drinking but others were drinking and groups were making trips to and from Oakura's Butler's Reef pub in Taranaki.

Greenslade, It continues, opened the door to a bedroom where his friends were with the victim, recording them for about 20 seconds before closing the door. A short time later he took a second video in the bedroom.

The next day Greenslade put up three recordings of the victim on a Facebook page which about 20 close friends and others used to post their 'antics'.

The victim, whose name has been suppressed, did not know Greeslade was filming and was devastated by his actions, the summary said.

New Plymouth Boys School is one of New Zealand's most distinguished boys' schools and 24 rugby All Blacks are among the school's old boys.
