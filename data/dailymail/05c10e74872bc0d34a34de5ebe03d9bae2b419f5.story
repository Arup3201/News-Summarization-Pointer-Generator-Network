Prince William and Kate have asked his 71-year-old former nanny to help look after baby George, it was reported today.

Jessica Webb is said to be considering the offer of coming out of retirement and being the 20-day-old prince's first charge.

Young William and Harry were shielded from their parents' bitter divorce by the nanny who never married or had children of her own.

She reportedly tried to ensure the princes did not witnessed the screaming rows between Prince Charles and Diana - caring for the the boys from the age of seven until William went off to prep school five years later.

After she left Kensington Palace, Ms Webb went on to work for Viscount Linley and his wife Serena looking after their son Charles and daughter Margarita.

But she kept in touch with the princes and was a guest at William's 21st birthday and attended the royal wedding two years ago.

One royal courtier told the Sunday People: 'Jessie would be ideal. Everyone likes her. She's discreet and she's of an age when she's not going to have her picture in the paper every five minutes.'

The paper claimed the 'granny nanny' is keen to help because William was a favourite of hers, but she is reluctant about doing the job full-time.

Princess Diana chose her to be William's main nanny overruling Prince Charles who had wanted an old-school royal appointee.

She believed Ms Webb would give the boys values of fairness and compassion and bring fun into her sons’ upbringing, according the paper.

William, 31, reportedly wants to recreate the same feeling of security that Jessica gave him and pass it on to his own son.

Kate, 31, is caring for George full-time but has been advised she will become exhausted by combining motherhood with her future royal duties.

At the moment she is being supported by her mother Carole Middleton while William is back on duty as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot in Angelsey, North Wales.

Royal courtiers have urged them to instal a more formal arrangement for looking after the baby once the summer is over.

Prince Edward’s wife Sophie Wessex, 48, employs two full-time nannies for her son and daughter.

A source told writer Sian James: 'They both accept the view that they won’t be able to do it all. There is also a feeling that Kate might lay herself open to criticism if she is seen letting her mother have too much influence.

'William has very fond memories of Jessie and they’ve put the idea to her that she comes back. I think she’s very flattered.'

Ms Webb, from London's East End, was traditionally trained and a colleague who worked with her is quoted as saying she had a “'terrific sense of humour'.

The colleague added: 'She would stand for no nonsense and would want to do things her way.'

William speaks to Kate and his baby son every day via videolink and Kate is supposed to be joining him on the island in four weeks’ time.

A kensington Palace spokesman told MailOnline: 'It is too early to talk about potential childcare arrangements at this stage.'
