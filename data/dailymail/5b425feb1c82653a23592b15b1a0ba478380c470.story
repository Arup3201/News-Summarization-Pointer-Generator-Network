Vince Cable faced fresh calls to resign today after it emerged Royal Mail could have been worth £10billion – three times what the government sold for it.

The CWU union claimed that in any other walk of life, securing such a poor deal 'would be a sacking offence' for the Business Secretary.

It follows reports banking giant JP Morgan told the government that it would value the firm, including its debts, at £7.75billion to £9.95bilion.

Grilling: Business Secretary Vince Cable is to face questions from MPs next month on whether Royal Mail was sold off on the cheap

The revelation reignited the furious row
about whether ministers rushed to sell off the national postal service 
on the cheap, handing big profits to City investors.

Shares in Royal Mail were sold by the government at £3.30 earlier this month, which valued the firm at £3.3billion.

But since then shares have soared to over £5, suggesting the company is worth £5billion.

Mr Cable last week claimed threats of strike action forced
ministers to cut the value of Royal Mail on the eve of its sell-off.

But CWU general secretary Billy Hayes said today: 'On the opening day of the flotation Vince Cable wrote off the undervaluation as froth. A week later, we were told it was the fault of the CWU.

'We now have a prima facie case of a conspiracy against the UK taxpayer who were opposed to the sale and have now been robbed of billions.

'In any other walk of life this would be a sacking offence and we call on Vince Cable to resign.'

Ministers were again challenged about the valuation in the Commons today. Business minister Michael Fallon insisted that ‘price volatility’ was to be expected in the immediate aftermath of a sale.

He said: ‘But let's be very clear this sale was popular, it was over-subscribed and it was successful.’

However, Labour seized the claim that the firm could be worth even more.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘The news that yet another leading investment bank valued Royal Mail at a far higher price than that for which it was sold will only add to fears that taxpayers have been significantly short changed by David Cameron’s Royal Mail fire sale.

‘This latest valuation is up to three times above what the public stake in the business was sold at.’

It comes as the Whitehall spending watchdog announced it would carry out a value for money probe into the sale, to ensure the taxpayer was not ripped off.

The National Audit Office said: ‘The examination will cover the issues of how the price range for the initial public offering was set and the discussion of possible revisions to the range.’

Value: The government sold Royal Mail, valued at £3.3billion, earlier this month but now it has emerged that JP Morgan valued it at almost £10billion

The news follows the revelation that activist hedge fund the Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) has amassed a 5.8 per cent stake in Royal Mail. It has bought 58.2 million shares worth around £290 million.

A Department of Business spokeman said: ‘A total of 21 banks pitched in May for the business of acting for the Government on the sale of Royal Mail as part of an extensive procurement process. Seven were successful.

‘The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain.  Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail’s future performance. The range was wide with the median around £3.6bn taking into account [an] IPO [initial public offering] discount.

‘The banks' appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisors to Government.

‘The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the Government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September.’
