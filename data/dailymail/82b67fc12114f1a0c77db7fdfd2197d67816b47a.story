A man who admitted having sex with a 12-year-old girl he met online has been sentenced to 270 days in jail following his arrest in May.

But prosecutors in Escondido, California say with 24-year-old Christopher Bradley Nutt's time already served and a policy allowing many inmates to serve half of their sentences, he could be out within a week.

Nutt, who was found with the child in his
bedroom hours after she was reported missing by her mother, will also 
have to serve five years' probation and register as a sex offender for 
the rest of his life, a Vista Superior Court Judge ruled.

Sentenced: Christopher Nutt, 24, seen from his Facebook profile, has been sentenced to 270 days in jail after having sex with a 12-year-old girl he met online this year

Sex offender: Prosecutors say with Nutt's guilty plea and time already served behind bars he should be out within a week but as a registered sex offender

Nutt's attorney argued his client having not known the girl's true age at the time, believing she was 16 or 18.

Speaking to reporters after the sentencing on Thursday, Attorney Dan Greene said: 'This wasnâ€™t a typical case of an adult preying on a 12-year-old girl.'

A family member of the girl overhearing Mr Greene's statements shouted at the 
man, reports UT San Diego, accusing him of lying.

During his sentencing hearing, Nutt apologized to the girl's family himself.

'I would like to accept full responsibility and I wish to extend a sincere and unconditional apology,' he said, according to the paper.

A prosecutor speaking with UT San Diego after the sentencing described it as a 'fair and just result.'

Prosecutors at the time of his trial accused Nutt of having sexual relations with the girl for an entire month before caught in May of this year.

He was charged with five incidents of intercourse with a minor, one incident of sodomy with a child younger than 14, four incidents of lewd acts with a child younger than 13, four incidents of oral copulation of a child younger than 14, five incidents of possession of child pornography and sexual exploitation of a child

Nutt had recently moved to the area from San Dimas.

An investigation into the matter showed he met the girl on social networking site Skout.

Scene: Police began searching for the girl, calling her friends and checking her cell phone to locate her before she was found in the 1000 block of Nightingale Place

It is unclear how he got her to come to his home.

Police say they found the girl after contacting some of her friends and checking her cell phone before the located her at Nutt's home.

Joel Mason, who owns the home where Nutt was renting a room, told San Diego6.com: 'I would have never expected it out of this guy, he seemed so clean cut and seemed like a decent person.'

The 24-year-old had just moved in about a month-and-a-half ago, and was rarely around, said Mr Mason.

During the interview process, Nutt asked Mason if he could occasionally bring girlfriends back to the room.
