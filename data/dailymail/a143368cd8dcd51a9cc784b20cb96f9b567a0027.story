The golf superstars with a hip-hop beat, boy-band dance moves and questionable costumes are making a comeback

The Golf Boys - Bubba Watson, Ben Crane, Hunter Mahan and Rickie Fowler - are making a triumphant return to music with a new single - '2.Oh.'

It's a follow-up to their last song, Oh Oh Oh, which debuted in June 2011 and has nearly 6 million views on YouTube.

Scroll down to watch the video

Back with a bang: (from left) Bubba Watson, Ben Crane, Hunter Mahan and Rickie Fowler star as the Golf Boys in their new video

Doing their part: The foursome have released the single to raise funds for change: water, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing clean drinking water in developing countries

Ready for their close-up: The video has the group in various cheesy costumes, dancing, rapping and even sunbathing in a sand trap

But don't worry, the giants of the links are not looking for a second career between tournaments - they're looking to raise money for a good cause.

The golfers have joined forces to help raise money for charity: water, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing clean drinking water for people in developing nations.

Barely recognizable in their outlandish attire, 'Flat bills' Fowler, 'Button up' Bubba, Insane Ben Crane and Mahan (with a grizzly beard like a mountain man) look eager to give mop-topped heartthrob Harry Styles and his One Direction pals a run for their money.

The video can be seen on YouTube on Crane's YouTube channel, where it already has nearly 800,000 views.

Catchy: The track is available on iTunes for download

Taking shots at themselves: This is the second single by the Golf Boys. 'Oh Oh Oh' in 2011 has nearly 6 million hits on YouTube

The track is also available on iTunes.

Meanwhile, Mahan, Watson and Fowler are due to tee it up in the WGC Cadillac Championship at Doral this week.

Crane will be sitting out the upcoming tournament.

Watson is also preparing to defend his Masters title next month at Augusta.
