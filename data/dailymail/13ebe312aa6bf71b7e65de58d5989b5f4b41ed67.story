A woman was arrested on Wednesday morning after she allegedly broke in a woman's home because she 'wanted a hug.'

A woman called police at 7am on Wednesday after she reported seeing Sunonna Hink, whom she didn't know, sitting in her living room.

The woman, who did not wish to reveal her identity, said that she went outside to bring her garbage to the dumpster and came back to find an unexpected visitor, reports the Casper Star Tribune.

When she came back to her apartment she saw a woman she'd never seen before in her residence and she firmly told her to leave.

The MailOnline spoke with the Casper Police Department who said that she also allegedly asked the woman if she could sit in her living room and drink.

The woman said no and Hink reportedly stood up to give the woman a hug and then told her she loved her.

Hink supposedly only agreed to leave the apartment when the woman's husband entered the room, according to an affidavit.

A Twitter that appears to be linked to Hink has a photo with two children in it but it's unclear whether or not they are related.

The MailOnline spoke with the Casper Police Department who said the woman was listed as being homeless.
