A teenage footballer was killed after he climbed onto the parapet of a bridge and fell 20ft onto a railway track following a drinking session with his friends.

Gareth Stringfellow, 18, who was twice over the drink drive limit, is feared to have lost his balance after clambering onto the top of the bridge while he was walking home.

He was killed as a result of the fall but his body was then hit by an express train travelling to London.

Tragedy: Gareth Stringfellow, 18, who had been 
drinking wine and cider is feared to have lost his balance after 
clambering onto the top of the bridge while he was walking home

The youngster may have been struck by up to 40 locomotives over a two hour period before one of the drivers realised he had hit something on the track and raised the alarm.

An inquest in Preston, Lancashire, was told the tragedy occurred last June after Gareth was due to go on a pre-season training programme with Northern Premier league club Kendal Town.

The youngster, from Chorley, Lancashire had had earlier trials with Blackburn Rovers before joining the academy at Bolton Wanderers and then playing for Preston North End until being released as a 16-year-old.

On the night of his death Gareth - known as 'Stringy' and 'Mr Cheekyface'- had enjoyed a night out out with friends, chatting and drinking alcohol.

Death: A train passing on the railway line near where Gareth Stringfellow's body was found close to a railway line in Coppull, Lancashire (pictured). It is thought that around 40 trains could have passed over his body

He had left a friend’s house at 9.30pm in a taxi, stopped off at a convenience store to buy rose wine and Strongbow cider and went on to the house of another friend Daniel Ashton and his girlfriend Amy.

Mr Ashton, who had known Gareth for about eight months told the hearing: 'We stopped off at the Spar in Coppull then went back to my house. We got some beers and he got some rose wine. He got some cans as well.

'We had a drink and had a laugh. It was just myself Amy and Gareth. He was happy. I didn’t think anything like this would happen ever. We had been just talking about our lives and a long chat.'

He said he remembered his friend speaking on the phone to his grandad saying: 'I wanted to tell you how much I love you.'

Memory: Tributes are left at the scene of where Gareth's body was found. He was hit be the 6.24am train from Preston to London and several other trains passed over him. He was twice over the drink driving limit

Gareth carried on listening to music after the couple had gone to bed in the early hours.

Mr Ashton was awoken three times by the music and ultimately told Gareth to leave around 5.30am.

Shortly afterwards Gareth returned for his jacket before walking down the path.

'That was the last time I saw Gareth', said Mr Ashton.

British
Transport Police said Gareth’s body was hit by the 6.24am train from 
Preston to London and several other trains passed over him. Tests showed
he was about twice the drink driving limit.

Inspector
David Howell, of British Transport Police said Gareth’s footprints were
found on the parapet of the bridge. He said: 'From my experience I 
would say that he climbed up onto the parapet and I would suggest the 
fall onto the track killed him.'

Talent: Gareth was a talented footballer and he was one of the youngster players to play in the Northern Premier League at 16 when he moved to Kendal. The coroner said alcohol could have played a part in his death'

Coroner Simon Jones recorded an open verdict and said: 'The possibility that alcohol could have played a part cannot be ignored.'

After the inquest Gareth’s father Jason said: 'He was such a lovely lad. Football meant everything to him and I can remember him getting up at 6am and wearing his kit ready for the game at 9am.

'He was one of the youngest players to play in the Northern Premier League at 16 when he moved to Kendal. His manager told us it would only be a matter of time before he was going to be snapped up by a professional football league club again.

'Football kept him on the straight and narrow. But he also had so many friends, He never wanted to be in and was out playing with his mates. Football was his life ever since he was little.'

David Howell, of British Transport Police said Gareth’s footprints were
found on the parapet of the bridge where he fell 20ft

Former Preston North End footballer Lee Ashcroft, who is manager at Kendal Town said at the time of the tragedy: 'I have known Gareth since he was 11-years-old and his death is like losing a son to me.

'I have seen him grow up as a footballer and a young man, he just had so much going for him. This is one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with, everyone connected with Kendal Town are just devastated at the news.

'I gave him his debut when he was just 16. It was unusual because he was playing against older, more experienced players but his talent and character made him ready for it.

'Everyone at the club adored him - the women fans immediately nicknamed him ‘Mr Cheekyface’. Everyone connected to the club is totally grief stricken.'
