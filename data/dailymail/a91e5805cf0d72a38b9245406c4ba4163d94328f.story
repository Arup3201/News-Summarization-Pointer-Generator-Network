David Cameron 'did not like' the controversial Top Gear India special that he appeared in, Downing Street sources revealed today.

The Prime Minister has been quick to distance himself from the BBC show after the 'tasteless' Christmas edition sparked fury from viewers and the Indian High Commission.

In the hope of avoiding a diplomatic row, Mr Cameron's aides emphasised that the Prime Minister had the 'utmost respect' for the people of India.

Mr Cameron features at the start
of the Top Gear special, waving to its presenters and smilingly telling them to 'stay away from
India'.

But staff
at the Indian High Commission complained that the programme was 'replete with 
cheap jibes, tasteless humour and lacked cultural sensitivity' and demanded an apology from the BBC.

Yesterday the Prime Minister's aides tried to avoid a row with a vital trading nation by insisting that the PM had not 
enjoyed the show, according to the Daily Telegraph.

One source said: 'He did not like 
the programme at all. The Indian people should know that the Prime 
Minister has the utmost respect for them.'

While standing in Downing Street at the start of the India special, the team even read out a 
letter from the PM in which he jokingly advises them to consider 'a 
fence-mending trip to Mexico'.

The Prime Minister's official 
spokesman said yesterday that Mr Cameron had just happened to be leaving the office when the show was being filmed there.

'As you know, the BBC are able to film in Downing Street
as are other broadcast companies. They were in the street and he was 
leaving for an event.

'The
Government is not responsible for editorial decisions made by the BBC 
or any media organisation. This is a matter for the BBC - I don't speak 
for the BBC.'

Toilet humour: The BBC admitted that 23 people complained after the Christmas special, in which the presenters attach a lavatory to their car before driving around India

'Crass': Clarkson strips to his underwear in front of his Indian hosts

Asked why
Mr Cameron had written a letter to the programme, the spokesman said: 'When people write to the Prime 
Minister, or indeed any other Government minister, it is customary to 
reply. He got a letter. He replied.'

The consulate has written to 
the BBC demanding they apologise for the episode, in which Jeremy Clarkson strips to his boxer shorts in 
front of his hosts and hangs offensive banners on trains.

A spokesman for the High Commission said
it had received hundreds of complaints after the special was repeated 
twice over Christmas.

They fired off emails and letters to the
show's producer, Chris Hale - copying in BBC director general Mark 
Thompson - expressing 'deep disappointment' at the content of Top Gear: 
India Special.

Diplomats had consented to the 
programme being shot in the country after receiving a letter from Mr 
Hale describing it as a 'light-hearted road trip'.

But the consulate complained in a letter that the content of the show was 'in breach of this agreement' and said the BBC would need to 'assuage the hurt sentiments of a huge number of people'.

The incident is the latest in a string of gaffes by the misbehaving Top Gear team. Last year, they were accused of racism after a show in which Clarkson said Mexicans had no sense of humour and co-star Richard Hammond described them as 'lazy, feckless and flatulent.'

Embarrassing: An insulting banner attached to a train in India by the BBC team

Offensive: When the carriages split the banner's double meaning became clear

The BBC said it had received 23 
complaints after the programme, which remains available online. It 
confirmed it had been sent a letter by the Indian High Commission and 
said it would respond in due course.

'We conveyed our disappointment,' said
a minister from the High Commission. 'The show was crass and 
misunderstanding of Indian culture.

'Lots of people have complained to us, both Indian and British. They are deeply offended and expect us to do something.

'We don't think this is the Government's view, but we want the BBC to stop repeating this programme and take action.'

The BBC's outline of the Top Gear special 
said the show would involve 'spontaneous interaction between the 
presenters and their environment'.

It
claimed that the key aspects would be 'beautiful scenery, busy city 
scenes, local charm and colour', emphasising India's 'local car 
culture'.

Instead, Clarkson and his co-presenters drove around in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot.

Rude: The Top Gear team attached this 'Eat English muffins' banner to the side of an Indian train

Shocking: Again the carriages divided to display an obscene slogan

Showing
off the car's unusual modification as he drove around the slums, 
Clarkson boasted: 'This is perfect for India because everyone who comes 
here gets the trots.'

They 
also hung up banners that read 'British IT is good for your company' and
'Eat English muffins', which turned into offensive messages when the 
carriages pulled them apart.

Clarkson, 51, is one of 
the BBC's highest paid stars, having earned Â£2.14million from his 
involvement in the Top Gear last year.

But the wayward star may have damaged Britain's relations with some other countries.

Just this week he claimed that Kent was full of immigrants from the Sangatte refugee camp in France.

He also used his 
newspaper column to compare the Morecambe Bay tragedy in which 23 
Chinese migrant workers died with synchronised swimming.

Back in November, the motormouth presenter horrified public sector workers by saying strikers should be shot.

From Chris Hale, Top Gear producer, to Indian High Commission, London

'Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will travel across India in three cars filming a light hearted road trip focusing on the journey and the inevitable idiosyncrasies of the cars they will drive, as well as the country and scenery we see along the way.

'There will be spontaneous interaction between the presenters and their environment, and potentially people they meet along the way. This will be in an incidental manner, not interviews.

'Key ingredients of what we film will be beautiful scenery, busy city scenes, local charm and colour within these locations, areas to illustrate the local car culture that exists in India.'6 January 2012

'The programme was replete with cheap jibes, tasteless humour and lacked cultural sensitivity. This is not clearly what we expect of the BBC. I write this to convey our deep disappointment over the documentary for its content and the tone of the presentation.

'You are clearly in breach of the agreement that you had entered into, completely negating our constructive and proactive facilitation. We strongly protest and expect the BBC to make amends, especially to assuage the hurt sentiments of a large number of people.'
