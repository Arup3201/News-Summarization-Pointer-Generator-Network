Barcelona forward Neymar has rubbished suggestions of dressing-room unrest at the club, insisting the whole squad remains united following their 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid.

The 22-year-old scored his side's opening goal on Sunday night, with duo  Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi also on target in a morale-boosting win for Luis Enrique's men.

After recent reports that club president Josep Maria Bartomeu was considering sacking Enrique after an apparent bust-up with Messi, Brazilian Neymar rejected the idea.

When asked specifically who has control within Barca, Messi or Luis Enrique, Neymar answered simply: 'Bartomeu.'

Former Santos striker Neymar has been in sensational form for Enrique's side so far this season, scoring an impressive 17 goals in just 22 appearances.

Next up for Neymar and Co is the return leg of their last-16 Copa del Rey clash against Elche on Thursday, before taking on Deportivo La Coruna in La Liga on Sunday.
