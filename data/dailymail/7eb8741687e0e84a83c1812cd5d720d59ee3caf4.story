Britain could be stripped of the power to give serial killers 'life means life' jail terms in a new showdown with Strasbourg.

A group of killers will insist the European Court of Human Rights grants them the right to demand their release from jail.

If the court rules in their favour, ministers will be forced to give 43 of the most dangerous serial killers and rapists behind bars in this country the right to apply to get out of prison early.

The list of those who would benefit is a roll call of evil, and includes Rose West, Peter Sutcliffe, Levi Bellfield and Steven Wright, all of whom have been given a 'whole life' sentence, meaning they will die behind bars.

Each would be granted a new 'human right' to have their case put before the Parole Board to argue that they had reformed and should be let out.

The case is brought by killers Jeremy Bamber, Peter Moore and Douglas Vinter, all of whom were given whole life terms because of the seriousness of their crimes.

It comes before the Strasbourg court tomorrow, with a judgment expected in weeks, at a time when relations between it and the Government are at a historic low.

Writing in the Mail today, former policing and justice minister Nick Herbert advocates withdrawal from the court, which he says has contributed to the spread of a 'rights contagion' in which 'everyone knows their rights, yet few admit their responsibilities'.

Tense: The relationship between the court and the UK parliament is already at an all time low and could be strained if the court rules in favour of the criminals tomorrow

Strasbourg first ruled against the three killers in January by a knife-edge vote of four judges to three, and the court has allowed an appeal to its Grand Chamber.

The dissenting judges said denying a parole hearing amounted to 'cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'.

Were the court to rule in the killers' favour, as some Strasbourg observers predict, it would be a direct challenge to the authority of Parliament to decide the law â€“ and of our courts to rule on it.
