A gay couple have sued after discovering that their engagement photo was distributed across a state on an anti-gay flier by a conservative group.

Brian Edwards, 32, and Tom Privitere, 37, said today that the photo of their happy day now makes them 'cringe' after a conservative group used their image with the headline: 'Idea of family values?'

The picture of the married couple holding hands and kissing against the New York City skyline was on display in front of 
the courthouse in Denver, Colorado.

Mr Edwards said they were suing to 'take back the beautiful 
image in our lives that was reflected in our engagement photo'.

The couple filed a lawsuit
in Denver federal court against a conservative group that used the photo without 
their permission and put it on mailers against a Colorado Republican 
state lawmaker who supported a failed civil unions bill.

The
Southern Poverty Law Center filed the lawsuit on behalf of the couple on
Wednesday against the Virginia-based 'Public Advocate of the United States'.

'At
one time, it made us happy to look at this photo and see all it 
represented - love, home, excitement for our upcoming marriage,' Mr Edwards
said.

Christine P. Sun, SPLC deputy legal director, said they 
don't know how Public Advocate obtained the photo or why they picked it.
It was posted on Mr Edwards' personal blog.

Sun told MailOnline that 'the public's reaction of outrage and disgust really reflects how vile this act was'.

She added that the couple had yet to hear any response from Public Advocate.

The couple said they 
found out their photo had been used when a friend told them he had seen a story about it in the news.

Ms Sun said they're 
suing for monetary damages to be determined at trial, misappropriation 
of the couple's image and copyright violation. The photographer who took
the photo is also a plaintiff in the case.

Ms Sun added: 'They were devastated 
by the idea that a young person in Colorado could receive this mailer 
and feel ashamed about his or her sexual orientation.'

Tom
and I both cringe now when we look at our engagement photo, a photo 
which will forever live on the internet as a message of hate.

Public
Advocate has not replied to an email request for comment from MailOnline today.

Group president Eugene Delgaudio previously told the Associated Press: 'I got your note about the 
story about the report. I am looking into this.'

The photo was 
used in mailers in a June primary election involving Senator Jean White, 
one of a handful of Republicans who supported a civil unions bill that 
was blocked in the state House.

The mailer, which replaced the Manhattan
skyline with a snowy background, read: 'State Senator Jean White's Idea
of ''Family Values?'"

White lost the primary against a fellow 
Republican in a northwestern Colorado district. She said she was 
disgusted the couple's personal photo was used in an attack that she 
believes ultimately swayed the race.

Ms White said: 'And to say, ''my idea of 
family values? Well, I tell you, I value all families,"' said White, who
was present with the Edwards and Privitere outside court.

Public 
Advocate also used the couple's photo in a mailer that for another 
northern Colorado state legislative race.

That race involved a 
Republican candidate who was not in the Legislature when civil unions 
were considered.

The mailer, which changed the New York background
to Colorado plains, had the caption: 'Jeffrey Hare's vision for Weld 
County?' Hare also lost his primary.

Mr Edwards said the use of photo brought back childhood memories of being bullied.

'Tom
and I both cringe now when we look at our engagement photo, a photo 
which will forever live on the internet as a message of hate,' he said.
