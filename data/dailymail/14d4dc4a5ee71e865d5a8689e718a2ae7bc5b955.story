A disabled man cheated death on Sunday surviving being run over by a high speed train.

55-year-old Benigno Nazario slipped and fell onto the tracks at Times Square, New York during a weekend break to Manhattan with his wife, Ana.

The father-of-two, who walks with two canes and suffers from high blood pressure, lost his balance as he stepped off a train and stumbled across the platform.

Danger: Benigno Nazario lost his balance on a Times Square subway platform and fell onto the tracks

'He turned over and fell onto the tracks,' Mrs Nazario told the New York Post. 'I was screaming, "Help!" I thought he was going to die.’

But Nazario's life was miraculously spared as an express train shot over him, because of the small cavity into which he had fallen.

He lay wedged there, inches from an electrified rail, as the train's operator slammed on the brakes and brought it to a stop partly over his body.

Rescue workers rushed to his aid and he was pulled from beneath the train still conscious, taking him to Belluvue hospital.

Miracle: Mr Nazario survived, suffering a punctured lung and two broken ribs and said he feels lucky to be alive

'I’m born again — I have another chance at life!' he told his wife as he lay recovering from two broken ribs and a punctured lung.

Mrs Nazario said her husband was alert and 'doing OK'.

The couple have been married for 20 years and have two sons - Raul, 30, and Oswaldo, 27.

They were visiting from Connecticut to celebrate Mrs Nazario being free from breast cancer for three years.

Fresh from a helicoptor tour of the city they were planning to sight-see around Times Square when the accident happened.
