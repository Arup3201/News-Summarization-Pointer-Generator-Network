BBC presenter Susanna Reid turned up the heat on her breakfast show yesterday by flirting with a rock star 15 years her junior during an interview.

The 42-year-old star raised eyebrows during her chat with Arctic Monkeys band member Alex Turner, which led to her telling him: ‘I bet you look good on the dance floor.’

After watching Miss Reid playing with her hair during the exchange with the singer and guitarist, viewers immediately took to Twitter to express their astonishment about her ‘flirtatious’ behaviour.

Miss Reid, who has three sons with her long-term boyfriend Dominic Cotton, is taking part in the current series of Strictly Come Dancing.

She was interviewing Turner, who is dating glamorous American actress Arielle Vandenberg, about the band’s album, AM, on BBC Breakfast yesterday.

At the end of the five-minute clip, she urged him to join Strictly Come Dancing, referencing the band’s 2005 hit, I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor.

She said: ‘When I said I was interviewing you, people did say, “would he do Strictly?” because they bet that you look good on the dance floor.’ 

Turner, 27, replied: ‘Of course... I should have been the one that said you look good on the dance floor.’

Happy in her work: Reid flirted her way through the interview

Reid's co-presenter Bill Turnbull looked bemused and said 'that was very laidback'

Reaction: Viewers took to Twitter in their droves to comment on the flirty interview

Miss Reid then replied: ‘Except that I’m not sure that would be accurate. I look a bit of a mess on the dance floor’, before Turner flashed a smile and said: ‘I doubt that.’

As the interview ended and the camera cut back to the studio, Bill Turnbull, Miss Reid’s co-presenter, jokingly embarrassed her by saying: ‘Oh, you get such a rapport with him, don’t you?

'People never said to you "go on, ask him about Strictly".'

An embarrassed Miss Reid laughed and replied: 'Don't deny it now, "ask him about Strictly" you said.'

Mr Turnbull quickly moved on to the show's next item but went on to refer to Miss Reid's interview with Turner as an 'exhilarating encounter'. 

And he was not the only one to notice the flirty nature of the interview.

The pair’s apparent chemistry was immediately noticed by viewers, while others pointed out her unusually casual denim jacket.

Julian West wrote on Twitter: ‘The BBC Breakfast interview with Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner is the flirtiest thing I’ve ever seen.

‘Felt like quietly tiptoeing out of the room.’

Another viewer, Matthew Thomson, said: ‘So much sexual tension in that Alex Turner interview.’

Chris Holding added: ‘The Susanna Reid interview with Alex Turner was like ear-wigging on a clandestine tryst.’

Tom Albrighton said: ‘Come downstairs to see Alex Turner flirting with Susanna Reid on BBC. Surreal.’

A show source said Miss Reid was displaying her usual interview style, adding: ‘Her style can be light and very friendly but to say she flirted is a little over the top.’

In 2010, Miss Reid’s interview with actor Hugh Grant led a viewer to complain she had behaved ‘like a 14-year-old on her first date’.

The Arctic Monkeys’ fifth album, AM, is joint favourite – along with veteran David Bowie’s comeback album, The Next Day – to take the Mercury Prize this year.
