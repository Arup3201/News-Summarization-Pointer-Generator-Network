An elite air force unit has a new weapon in the fight against crime - a parachuting dog.

Jany, a Belgian Malinois, jumps out of a plane more than 1,000ft above the ground strapped to the chest of an officer.

Before a jump, she lies calmly on the aircraft floor in her body harness before it's time to make the leap.

Jany, an explosives detector dog, is part of the Group of Air Special Commands, based outside the Colombian capital Bogota.

In these photographs she is seen in the arms of Officer Jorge Herrera, her tandem partner, before they get ready for their mission.

The 90-strong squad fights terrorism and criminal activity at all of Colombia's airports.

Each paratrooper carries their equipment on their body for their jumps, which are fraught with danger as landing areas are often full of anti-personnel blast mines - landmines designed for humans.

Before they throw themselves out of their plane, the troopers bid each other farewell and wish their comrades a safe landing.

Photographer Oliver Ehmig, from Colombia, captured the moments of calm.

The Group of Air Special Commands' task, aided by Jany, is to combat terrorist and criminal activity at all of Colombia's airports

He said: 'Minutes before the jump, I noticed the fraternal friendship between the members of the Group of Air Special Commands.

'They were joking and pulling pranks on each other and Jany seemed calm, fully aware that she’s going to jump out.

'She was extremely calm during the flight and was euphoric when she touched the ground.

'What I enjoy most is the silence before, followed by a collective euphoria among the group after the successful manoeuvre.'

Mr Ehmig said recruits go through a gruelling selection process to be chosen for the team, based at the Madrid air base outside the capital.

Jumps can be dangerous for the soldiers because landing area are often dotted with anti-personnel blast mines

He added: 'Their members have been through the legendary “Lancer” course, considered one of the most rigorous military training in the world.

'They are highly trained to resolve airplane hostage situations.'

The Belgian Malinois, related to the German Shepherd, is popular with armed forces and the police for its loyalty and ability to detect explosives and drugs.

A Malinois named Cairo was part of the United States Navy SEALS squad that killed Osama Bin Laden.
