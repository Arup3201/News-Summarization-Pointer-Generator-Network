Arsenal play New York Red Bulls on Saturday when they will come up against Thierry Henry – and Arsene Wenger joked he had hoped the Frenchman would once again don Arsenal’s colours. 

Wenger has only taken one recognised striker to New York, Chuba Akpom, who looks likely to start after impressing as a half-time substitute against Boreham Wood.

Wenger said: ‘I came here with only one striker because I hoped he would play one half for us. He practises with us and is still very sharp and he came back here in very good shape.’

Arsenal are without their three German World Cup stars who are also likely to miss the opening league game of the season against Crystal Palace.

New York Red Bulls last met the Gunners in 2011, travelling for that summer's Emirates Cup, where they earned a 1-1 draw against their hosts, and they're hoping to go one better three years down the line.

For Arsene Wenger's side, though, this is a more important fixture in terms of developing steam ahead of the 2014-15 campaign, with some minnows within the squad hoping to seize their chance in New Jersey.
