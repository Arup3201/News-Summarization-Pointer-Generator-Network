Teenager George Williams grabbed a hat-trick as Wigan stormed to the top of the Super League table with a 10-try rout of an outclassed Hull at the DW Stadium.

The reigning Super League champions never looked back after full-back Lewis Tierney, son of former dual international Jason Robinson, put them in front with a spectacular fourth-minute try while England winger Josh Charnley celebrated his 100th Super League appearance with a try in his side’s 56-10 triumph.

The defeat was another hammer blow to the play-off hopes of Hull, who have taken just a point from their last five games.

Summit: Reigning Super League champions Wigan returned to the top of the table with this win

Remarkably, the Black and Whites, who gave a debut to18-year-old Jack Logan in the absence of former Great Britain centre Kirk Yeaman, won 34-33 in the corresponding game in 2013 but will be glad to see the back of the Warriors after conceding 100 points in two matches to them this season.

Wigan made the best possible start when Tierney, making his first Super League appearance of the season in place of the injured Matty Bowen, gathered Jordan Rankin’s kick on his own 20-metre line and scythed through a fragmented Hull defence for a spectacular solo try which his father would have been proud to score.

Hull were briefly level when Charnley made a hash of an attempted clearance from Jordan Abdull’s grubber kick to present winger Fetuli Talanoa with a soft try but the visitors rarely threatened the Warriors line.

It took Shaun Wane’s men some time to find their groove but they effectively put the game to bed with three tries in a 12-minute spell before half-time.

In the corner: Lewis Tierney celebrates his score for Wigan against Hull

Charnley took Anthony Gelling’s pass to force his way over at the corner for his 12th try in six appearances since returning from injury and then stand-off Williams briefly took centre stage by scoring one try and making another.

First he dummied his way over from close range and then burst out of his own half with skipper Sean O’Loughlin in support. As the cover closed in on the Wigan loose forward, he slipped a superb overhead pass for Matty Smith to finish off the move.

Smith kicked his third conversion to make it 22-4 and it could have been worse for Lee Radford’s side.

Wigan’s former Hull KR prop Scott Taylor lost the ball on the stroke of half-time as he attempted to touch down and Charnley fumbled Tierney’s pass early in the second half with the line beckoning.

Wigan’s superior class eventually began to tell on the scoreboard, with Williams demonstrating fleet of foot to score his second try and hooker Sam Powell doing likewise to jink his way over for a score.

Williams completed his hat-trick on the hour after Smith had demonstrated the dribbling skills that once earned him a trial at Everton and the scrum-half took his goal tally to six from seven attempts to extend the score to 40-4.

It was rapidly turning into a rout as Hull’s defensive efforts descended into farce.

Centre Dan Sarginson pounced on a handling error to get left winger Dom Manfredi over for one try and then repeated the feat after Gelling’s speculative kick caused confusion in the visitors defence.

Loose forward Liam Watts scored a consolation try for Hull, converted by Rankin, but Wigan had the final say when Scott Taylor became the first forward to touch down for them in the final minute and Smith took his goal tally to eight.
