They are locked in a ferocious battle to attract the attention of a perfectly-groomed male suitor.

But he does not appear to be interested in the commotion he has caused - looking unaffected by the noisy display between the two love rival kestrels.

The determined female American Kestrels flapped their wings and attacked each other with their talons as they fought over a  wooden perch and a potential mate in Colorado.

Project manager and part-time wildlife photographer, Kurt Bowman, captured the extraordinary scene while visiting his mother who lived nearby.

The 46-year-old from Denver, Colorado, said: 'I had stopped by a farmer's canal where I normally photograph ducks and kingfisher.

'I was hoping at first to find the kingfisher who frequents the area but I noticed someone had cut down a few trees and the bird was gone.

'I was disappointed that someone would ruin her habitat and I was getting ready to make my way to my mother's, when I noticed two American Kestrels out of the corner of my eye.

For a few minutes, the determined female American Kestrels circled the wooden perch in Colorado 

Part-time wildlife photographer, Kurt Bowman, said: 'It appeared as if the two females were fighting over the male while he would just watch'

The photographer continued to watch the trio until one was finally successful and rewarded for her efforts

'I stopped and starting watching and found out it was actually three - one male and two females.

'It appeared as if the two females were fighting over the male while he would just watch.'

The pair continued trying to run each other off the perch, determined not to let the other get closer to the male.

The photographer continued to watch the trio until one was finally successful and rewarded for her efforts.

Mr Bowman said: 'I found out later when reading up on their behaviour, that this is something they do when courting a mate.'

The American kestrel, also known as the sparrow hawk, is a small falcon and the only kestrel found in the Americas. 

They are found in a wide variety of habitats, but are most common in lowland areas and open country with sparse trees which provide roosts when it is foraging.

At just 19cm to 21cm  long, they also the smallest falcons in North America.

The American kestrel hunts by hovering in the air with rapid wing beats or perching and scanning the ground for prey. 

Its diet typically consists of grasshoppers, lizards, mice, and small birds.

American kestrels only mate with one individual, forming a strong and permanent bond. 

The females can demonstrate aggressive behaviour when competing for a mate
