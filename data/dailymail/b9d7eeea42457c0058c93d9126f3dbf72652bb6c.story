Made In Chelsea was back with a bang on Sunday night as TV's favourite toffs landed in New York for a stateside spin-off.

Familiar faces such as loveable pug Spencer Matthews and pint-sized Louise Thompson returned to our screens - but there were also some newcomers to the show, including Binky's big sister Anna-Louise Felstead, who joins the West London set as they spend the summer in New York.

Anna-Louise, 35, is the eldest of three Felstead siblings and could potentially serve as a shoulder to cry on as Binky's turbulent love life with Alex Mytton unfolds.

Big Binky! Anna-Louise Felstead joined the Made In Chelsea cast as they starred in the debut New York spin-off show so FEMAIL caught up with her to find out what it's like to be Binky's big sister

As avid Made In Chelsea fans will be well aware, Alex repeatedly messed with Binky's emotions in the last season of the posh reality TV show but as Sunday's show revealed, Binky has finally seen sense and cut ties with the love rat. 

Speaking to MailOnline, New-York based artist Anna-Louise said: 'It was a given that I’d be there to support Binky following the break-up. Usually she has mum, her dog Scrumble and her friends in London so I was there to offer a strong family support network.'

'The whole family were pulling their hair out when she continued to date Alex,' revealed Anna-Louise.

'We're just all so relieved she's finally seen sense. She wasn't acting herself at all, she was blinded by him and was clinging onto that earlier feeling of being in a loving secure relationship. 

'She is worth so much more than that so yes, we're all very relieved it's over.'

Family first: Binky, Jane and Anna-Louise are extremely close and Anna-Louise said the whole family were so relived when Binky and Alex finally called it quits

Another cast member who shares Anna-Louise's train of thought is Cheska Hull, who Anna-Louise describes as 'properly supportive' and a 'wonderful' friend to Binky.

Opening up about growing up with Binky (who got her nickname 'because she's the youngest - small and dinky - which ended up as Binky somehow), Anna-Louise said: 'We are very close, although not very similar. She's more like my brother (i.e. naughty!). I'm more arty. 

'Early memories of Binks were me dressing her up and photographing her for my Foundation art projects. When she was very young, she was often pottering around the garden wearing nothing but bright Wellington boots bottle feeding our baby goats. 

'She was also riding my old pony Megan in a basket saddle before she could even walk.'

Arty: Anna-Louise started working as a reportage artist and illustrator, painting and drawing on location at events like London Fashion Week and The Cartier Polo World Cup on Snow in St Moritz, and now she's a full-time artist based in New York

Need for speed: Anna-Louise is selling off her racy illustrations of motorsport events on Easyart and Binky says she is sure the collection is going to be a 'huge success' 

While Binky followed the reality TV path, her sister pursued her passion for art and is fast becoming renowned in the creative world.

Anna-Louise started working as a reportage artist and illustrator, painting and drawing on location at events like London Fashion Week and The Cartier Polo World Cup on Snow in St Moritz, as well as illustrating articles for magazines and newspapers such as The Independent, Guardian and Spears WMS. 

'I started filling up my father's work diary a from a very early age - he would bring large empty calendars back from the office,' she said of her earliest art memories.

'I was constantly drawing and painting and when I was very young started painting our pet chickens to sell to my parents' friends. At Saint Martins I contacted the Royal Navy and asked to paint on board ships. I spent two weeks on HMS CORNWALL documenting life at sea.'

It's over: Binky and Alex Mytton, pictured in happier times enjoying some cocktails on the beach during a romantic holiday together, have finally called it a day - and the Felstead family couldn't be happier

Avid art fan: The 35-year-old said she started filling up her father's work diary a from a very early age - he would bring large empty paged calendars back from the office - and now she's made a career out of it

Talent: Binky's sister is selling her works of art, which feature popular Chelsea haunts, on Easyart

Anna-Louise has been full-time self-employed artist since 2005 and has given Easyart the exclusive licence to print her eye-catching artworks that depict some of Chelsea’s most famed hotspots, often frequented by the Made in Chelsea cast, as well as her illustrations of motorsport events.

Speaking about her sister's talent, Binky  said: 'I’m really thrilled that my sister is working with Easyart. She is such an amazingly talented artist and I’m sure the collection is going to be a huge success.' 

Glamorous: While Anna-Louise pursued her love of painting, Binky has become one of Britain's best-known reality TV stars - but she's still a country girl at heart and spends a lot of time back in the 'Shire with her family
