Amanda Knox has vowed not to return to Italy for her re-trial for the murder of her British roommate, explaining: 'I just can't relive that.'

In her first live interview about the upcoming court battle, the 26-year-old student said that she believes missing the trial over the 2007 killing of Meredith Kercher is simply 'common sense'.

She was acquitted of the crime in 2010 after already serving nearly four years behind bars.

'I was already imprisoned as an innocent person in Italy, and I can't reconcile the choice to go back with that experience,' she told the Today show's Matt Lauer about the retrial, which starts in 10 days.

Refusal: Speaking on the Today show, Amanda Knox said it was 'common sense' that she will not return to Italy for the re-trial in the murder of her British roommate in 2007. Knox was freed in 2010

'It's not a possibility, as I was imprisoned as an innocent person and I just can't relive that... It's common sense not to go back.'

She told Lauer that she believes she will win the retrial and will not return to prison.

On a practical level, she added that she simply cannot drop everything to go to Florence because numerous factors - including financial pressures and the fact she attends school - would stop her.

She said that the idea of returning to prison still haunts her.

'I thought about what it would be like to live my entire life in prison and to lose everything, to lose what I've been able to come back to and rebuild,' she said.

Speaking out: In the interview with Matt Lauer she said she still had nightmares about her time in prison

Moving on: Knox is now studying in Seattle and said that she could not just drop her studies for the trial

'I think about it all the time. It's so scary. Everything's at stake.'

Knox even penned a letter to her unborn child for Today.com voicing her fear that she could live behind bars and never fulfill her wish to become a parent.

Loss: British student Meredith Kercher was found killed in the apartment the girls shared in Perugia

The trial, which begins September 30, 
is the third time Knox has been on trial for the alleged murder of 
Meredith Kercher in the home they shared in Perugia while both were 
students in 2007.

Knox and 
her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of the killing in 
2009 and spent nearly four years in prison before they were acquitted on
appeal and released in October 2011.

Prosecutors had claimed that Kercher's murder came after a violent sex game gone wrong.

In
March, the Italian Supreme Court rejected the appeals court ruling and 
ordered a new trial. It is not yet clear if the U.S. would allow her to 
be extradited if she is re-convicted.

Knox said the idea that she could be judged for not attending the trial 'drives me crazy'.

'What is being on trial here is not my
character. It shouldn't be,' she said. 'What should be on trial is the 
facts of the case. If you look at the facts of the case, there's proof 
of my innocence.'

Ivory 
Coast native Rudy Guede was convicted of the murder and sentenced to 30 
years in prison - later reduced to 16 years on appeal. His fingerprints 
and DNA were found at the crime scene.

Knox,
who now lives and studies in Seattle, has written a book, Waiting to Be
Heard, in which she details her stay in prison and maintains she is 
innocent.

She said she has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder since being released.

'It's happening so fast, and I’m not 
quite sure what’s going to happen,' Knox told Lauer. 'But I'm trying to 
do everything I can to make a difference.'
