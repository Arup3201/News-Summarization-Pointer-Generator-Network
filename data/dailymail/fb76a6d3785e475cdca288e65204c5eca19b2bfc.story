Sam Allardyce has lamented the physical demands placed on his players as he faces up to being without two key players on Saturday.

West Ham duo Diafra Sakho (back) and Stewart Downing (knee) are both doubts for the clash against Everton.

The injuries were sustained whilst both players were on international duty, Downing with England and Sakho with Senegal.

And Allardyce claims club managers are suffering because of the strains put on players.

‘The load of constant performance at the highest level takes it’s toll across the whole of the Premier League,’ said the Hammers boss.

‘The demand on the player is so great for so long, so often that eventually they are going to break down at some stage.

‘If you look at the load this year on players, it gets greater than ever before. Not only do they travel at international level across the world but the constant pressure of the Premier League is every getting faster and more demanding physically and mentally.

‘The time they have to rest is fewer and further between and that ultimately ends up with players never really recovering fully enough to go into the next game.

‘As hard as we try to prevent those injuries it is an impossibility by the demand on the players – and that demand comes because the player wants ever more money to play for you so it’s a vicious circle.

‘If the players’ demands came down then perhaps the demands to find more and more money wouldn’t be as great. Managing that situation is extremely difficult now.’

Meanwhile, Allardyce says there is still no resolution to central defender Winston Reid’s protracted contract talks.

Reid is out of contract at the end of the season and could leave on a lucrative free contract in the summer.

Allardyce said: ‘That’s an ongoing negotiation with the chairman to make a positive outcome for us. I think he [Reid] is comfortable here, but it’ll probably go down to money.
