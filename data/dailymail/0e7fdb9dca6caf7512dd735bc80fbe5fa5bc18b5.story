A cash-strapped police force paid a member of staff £7,500 in compensation after she suffered 'discomfort' because her headset was too loud.

Figures revealed by Staffordshire Police show the force shelled out over £134,000 to regular officers and PCSOs in just four years.

One 46-year-old female officer pocketed £4,400 for a strain caused by an 'ill-fitting protective vest' in January 2009 while another received £6,262 when she tripped in an unlit area

In total Staffordshire Police paid out £134,000 to 27 officers and PCSOs between 2009 and 2013, including £2,000 to one 43-year-old officer for falling over a curb in February 2012

A 43-year-old PC also got £2,000 for falling over a curb in February 2012, and a male PC got £10,000 for a spinal injury caused by a fall on ice from a burst water pipe in December 2010.

Another got £1,850 for falling over a pothole in February last year while one employee received a whopping £14,474 for slipping on an 'untreated' surface in June 2011.

A Freedom of Information request revealed in total the force have paid out £134,100 for 27 claims by officers and members of staff between 2009 and 2013.

Cases were submitted for injuries including broken bones, cuts, whiplash, and stress from incidents like road traffic collisions and training exercises.

One 39-year-old female member of staff's case is still ongoing after she complained of multiple bruising for a fall due to a 'lift not being level when stopped' in 2011.

Ray Egan, 75, a former officer from the neighbouring West Midlands Police from 1967 to 1993, described the payouts as 'embarrassing'.

Police officers have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are:

WPC Fiona Clark sued for £400,000. She hurt her back lifting boxes of stationery.

WPC Kelly Jones demanded £50,000 from the owner of a petrol station where she tripped on the kerb during a call-out.

Detective
 Inspector Brian Baker won a £7,000 payout after he claimed exposure to 
cannabis fumes made him snore and caused problems in his marriage.

WPC Louise McGarva sued for £500,000 after claiming she developed a fear of sirens following a riot-training exercise.

PC John Franklin won £108,000. He was injured by handcuffs on a safety course.

PC George Smillie was awarded an estimated £10,000 after he hurt his knee playing football on a training course.

WPC Lesley O’Shea sued for £200,000 after slipping on a banana skin.

He said: 'It's all to do with this claim culture, it's like a disease and people are jumping on the bandwagon.

'Back in our day we knew being injured in the line of duty was a risk - but we got on with it because we wanted to protect the public.

'It was part and parcel of being a copper. I don't know where it is going end. It is embarrassing for all forces involved at a time when they are looking to save cash.

'It's costing the country a lot of money, it could be spent on policing and put to much better use.

'It's crazy really. They can't stop people claiming, it's just going to go on and on. I'm just glad I'm retired and out of it.'

Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, added: 'Some of these claims are clearly ludicrous. The force must do a better job protecting taxpayers.'

Not all of the claims were approved, however. Among those turned down was a female officer who applied for compensation for bruising sustained whilst entering a police car in January 2009.

Another female member of staff received nothing after claiming she received a spinal injury by adjusting a chair in June 2010.

And several officers' claims were rejected for cuts or wounds sustained as a result of being bitten by a police dog.

Andy Adams, chairman of the Staffordshire Police Federation said long-running disputes over pensions and pay could be to blame for the 'claim culture'.

He added: 'I think for some officers the goodwill has gone from the job, and they feel battered from the changes to pay and pensions, so maybe when in the past they wouldn't have made a claim for injuries they're now feeling unloved and feel they need to claim.'

Mr Adams also defended officers who receive payouts after being injured in traffic collisions or when trying to arrest offenders.

He added: 'Some of the claims are a bit bizarre, and I do wonder why people are claiming for injuries they might have caused themselves.

'But for officers injured performing an arrest, on a high speed pursuit or similar incidents, then I've absolutely no problem with that.' 

The figures follow on from a claim for £50,000 in damages by WPC Kelly Jones after she tripped over a curb at a petrol station in March last year, claiming she had been put at 'unnecessary risk'.

Petrol station owner Steve Jones called the police after the alarm began going off at the Nuns' Bridges Service Station and WPC Jones went to investigate.

She eventually dropped her claim, but only after sending Mr Jones a three-page solicitors letter outlining her claim, leaving him seething with anger.

In November, PCSO Pauline Harrison, 53,injured herself after falling over while investigating a break-in at a property firm. She was awarded £4,000, but solicitors took £57,000 in fees.
