The wind turbine built with £48,000 of taxpayers' money has been producing so little electricity it will take more than 400 years to repay the bill

A wind turbine built with £48,000 of taxpayers’ money has been producing so little electricity it will take more than 400 years to repay the bill, it emerged yesterday.

Despite being in a windy, coastal town, the 60ft structure was built in a sheltered valley and managed to generate only an average of £5 worth of electricity a month.

Now critics have branded the scheme  ‘an obscenely expensive vanity project’.

The turbine was erected at the Aberystwyth offices of the Labour-controlled Welsh government in 2009 with the aim of reducing its carbon footprint.

But
 after years of scepticism – and in response to a freedom of information
 application – the assembly finally admitted yesterday that the turbine 
had generated just 33kWh of electricity a month.

Officials blamed 
mechanical problems, which meant the turbine had been able to work at 
only quarter capacity until the start of this year.

It is now operating at 68 per cent of capacity, but the electricity it generates still works out at less than £9 a month.

At that rate it will take around 450 years for the cost of buying and installing the turbine to be recouped.

The
 company which supplied it, Quiet Revolution, denied mechanical problems
 were to blame and said it had warned the Welsh government in advance 
that the site was too sheltered.

Experts
 agreed that in a more-exposed spot in a coastal town  buffeted by 
weather from Cardigan Bay, a turbine ought to be capable of generating 
20 times as much power.

‘The
 problem is quite simple – it’s been put in the wrong place,’ turbine 
installer Paul Burrell said. Turbines need unobstructed access to wind 
from all directions. ‘Unfortunately the Welsh government’s one is 
located in a valley two miles from the sea and has quite a short tower.

‘It’s next to tall buildings – so even if there’s a strong wind it will be displaced by the time it reaches the turbine.’

 Jonathan
 Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It would 
seem that the turbine’s installation was nothing more than an obscenely 
expensive vanity project.’

And
 he pointed out: ‘If this project had been started when Elizabeth I was 
on the throne, it would only be reaching break-even point now, 60 years 
into the reign of Elizabeth II.

Waste of money: This taxpayer-funded 60ft wind turbine has been producing just £5 of electricity a month - because it was put up in an area of Aberystwyth where there is very little wind

Last
 night the Welsh government said the turbine was part of its ‘ambitious’
 green programme which also featured a biomass heating system and solar 
panels at its Aberystwyth offices.

‘As
 a result, we have seen a 17 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions over 
the past two years and are well on course to meet the overarching target
 of a 30 per cent reduction by 2020.’

n A couple has won a legal ruling  that ten wind turbines be removed because they spoil the view from their home in France.

In
 a judgment with widespread implications for the rest of the EU, a court
 in Pas-de-Calais agreed the 360ft-high structures ruined Erik and 
Ingrid Wallecan’s quality of life.

The
 Wind Company, part of energy giant GDF Suez, was fined £31,500 and told
 to remove the turbines within four months or face daily penalties of 
£450.
