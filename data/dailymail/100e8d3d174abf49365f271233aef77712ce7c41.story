What started last March as lower back pain for a Maryland woman took only weeks to leave her paralyzed from the chest down – and ended with thousands of strangers paying her medical bills.

Melissa Smith, already a two-time cancer survivor at the age of 26, was diagnosed by doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore, with Transverse Myelitis. The disease causes the immune system to attack the spinal cord, leading to paralysis.

Unable to keep her head above water in a sea of medical bills, Ms Smith soon found herself in massive debt. Relief soon came in the most unlikely form, online donations from random strangers – donations now reach into the hundreds of thousands, she told The Blaze.

Down but not out: Melissa Smith may not ever be able to walk again, but it hasn't robbed her of living her life

Stephanie Smith pitched her sister’s plight to Chive Charities for months. The website is a hub for publicizing people’s stories and helping them raise money. After months of pitching, the site agreed to take them on.

Thousands were raised within minutes of the story going live, Stephanie Smith told the site.Soon the zeroes started multiplying.

‘When we started the reading the day the story went live, Chive told me to go to the GoFundMe site and I had like 40 people around me and I was thinking to myself, ‘Obviously we just finished reading, no one could have donated yet,’ she said.

‘It was almost to 10k when we shifted to that page!’ She gratefully added. ‘I cried, I was so shocked. I never imagined I could touch so many people.’

She'll never walk again: Melissa Smith is adjusting to her new reality, and plans to use the money for things that will make her life easier, including a new handicap-friendly home

Strangers have donated over $400,000 to help pay Melissa Smith’s medical bills.

‘I am so thankful and feel so blessed, so lucky, so loved and so honored that they chose me and believe in me so much,’ Stephanie Smith continued.

‘That’s what means so much to me, everyone has so much faith in me and its helping me find a little more faith In myself that I lost a little bit the last 18 months or so,’ she added.

Proper attire required: Ms Smith can only stand wearing a special suit

The thankful sisters respond to every email they receive.

‘I don’t really know how to appropriately thank every single person for giving me that faith back and all of their support,’ said Stephanie Smith.

‘It truly has touched my heart so deeply and just want to give back in any way that I can for the rest of all time,’ she added.

The ailing woman plans to use the money for a standing frame, another wheelchair, pay some of the medical debt and put a down payment on a handicap-friendly home, the two women told the site.

Despite all the outpouring of goodwill, the former nursing student – she was booted from the program – still has difficulties coming to grips with her new reality.

‘I still have days where I worry about if someone will want to be with me, will I have a family, what am I going to do for a living now,’ she said.

‘I have a lot of fears but I’m in a very different place now than I was one year ago’ she added. ‘I wasn’t sure if I could handle my own life this time last year.’
