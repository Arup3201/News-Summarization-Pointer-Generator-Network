Olympic athlete Lolo Jones has become embroiled in further controversy after she told a paralyzed former football player to 'get checked for a concussion' because he had 'clearly been hit in the head'.

The hurdler joked about head injuries to former Rutgers player Eric LeGrand after he challenged her to a race on Twitter. What she didn’t know was the defensive tackle was paralyzed in an October 2010 game.

After LeGrand, 22, tweeted to Jones 'Want to race me?' on Tuesday night, she replied: 'Get Checked for a concussion. Clearly, u’ve been hit in the head... Cos u arnt beating a track athlete.'

When other users informed Jones of LeGrand’s injuries, she wrote: 'Great I’m gonna get murdered for that tweet. When I had no clue who that dude was. Just responding to any athlete who challenges me to a race.'

LeGrand tweeted that he understood what had happened and didn’t take it personally, saying: 'All good.'

As the incident continued to reverberate across social media on Wednesday, LeGrand later posted that the reaction was 'ridiculous'.

He wrote that 30-year-old Miss Jones is a 'great person who misunderstood what I tweeted. People stop bashing her it’s not right'.

Several of the tweets were later removed. 

LeGrand broke two vertebrae and suffered a serious spinal cord injury on October 16, 2010, during a kickoff return. 

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, under 
former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano, signed LeGrand as a symbolic gesture 
in May. He now works in broadcasting.

LeGrand’s
Twitter bio describes him as a 'Defensive Tackle for Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers,' though the photo shows him in a wheelchair.

Jones wrote on Twitter that because she was viewing the page on her phone, the picture was too tiny to see clearly.

finished fourth in the 100-meter hurdles at the London Olympics in 
August amid criticism that she receives more attention and endorsements 
than her results warrant.

Four years earlier in Beijing, the American came in as the favorite and 
was in position to win gold when she hit the ninth of 10 hurdles and 
wound up seventh.

Miss Jones was at the center of another Twitter storm earlier this year, when the 30-year-old hurdler announced that she was still a virgin on the micro-blogging site.

She also became embroiled in a nasty catfight with teammates during the Olympics after they suggested that their medal success was overshadowed by Jones because of the hype around her personal story and a nude photo-shoot for ESPN magazine in 2009.

Dawn Harper, 28, and Kellie Wells, 30, who finished second and third respectively in Olympic 100m women's hurdles final, spoke bitterly about Miss Jones, who finished in fourth place.
