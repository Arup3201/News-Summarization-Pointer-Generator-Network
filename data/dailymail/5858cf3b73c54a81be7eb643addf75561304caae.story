More than one in ten police officers are set to lose their jobs as a result of spending cuts, a report warned last night.

By 2015 numbers in England and Wales are expected to fall to 127,600, their lowest level since 2001 and a fall of 16,000, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said.

The report indicated that the reduction could fuel a sharp rise in crime, especially property thefts.

Axe: About 16,200 police officers will be axed by 2015 amid fears crime could go up by three per cent

In a second blow for the Government, the watchdog also warned that locking up fewer offenders would lead to higher crime.

The report is the first authoritative study of the impact of cuts of 20 per cent in Home Office funding for the police.

Labour accused the Government of taking an 'irresponsible gamble with crime and public safety'.

However, ministers continued to insist that cuts could be made without affecting the quality of front-line services, through efficiency savings.

The 'Adapting to Austerity' report - based on force predictions - said that between March 2010 and March 2015, the total police workforce including backroom staff, will fall by 34,000 from 243,900, a cut of 11 per cent.

Of those, 16,200 will be police officers, 16,100 will be police staff and 1,800 community support officers.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, has put chief constables up and down the country in an impossible position.'

Three out of four employers plan to increase their workforce over the next few months, showing that business confidence is on the rise, according to new research today

A survey of 600 employers by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), also showed that redundancies, headcount freezes and reduced working hours were all 'significantly' down

Most of those polled said they would look to increase or maintain their use of agency staff over the next year

Roger Tweedy, the REC's director of research, said: 'It is too early to predict whether this will translate into significant jobs growth by the end of the year but we remain confident that the private sector can absorb the fall-out from public sector cuts.

The reduction in paid officers will 
in part be offset by rises in unpaid Special Constables. Their numbers 
will increase by more than 7,000 to 22,600.

A review of academic research 
published by HMIC on how police cuts influence crime found a ten per 
cent fall in officers could lead to crime, especially property theft, 
rising by around three per cent.

Such a rise in burglary would mean 22,000 more victims every year.

Currently a burglary  is committed 
every 40 seconds. The report’s author, Roger Baker, said the police 
were facing their biggest financial challenge in a generation.

He said how police chiefs deployed their staff was a key factor in dealing with crime.

And he added: ‘Forgive the very 
old-fashioned view, [but] if you lock up criminals it tends to have a 
very good effect in your local communities because they are not causing 
you harm and distress.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the report made it clear there are huge savings to be made in bureaucracy.

Scotland Yard is due to lose 3,111 staff, including 1,907 officers, figures obtained by Ken Livingstone said

The report does not account for any 
cuts in police pay proposed by former rail regulator Tom Winsor, nor in 
savings made by police in other areas such as how they buy goods.

Mr Clegg added: ‘There are far, far 
too many police officers who are filling in forms or tied down to their 
desks when they are not out in the community where they belong.’

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper 
said: ‘Many forces have no choice but to cut front-line officers because
 of the scale and pace of the Government cuts.

‘Theresa May has put chief constables
 in an impossible position. Crime fell for many years under Labour, but 
people want it to fall further.

‘Right now the Government has no plan to cut crime, they are only cutting officers instead.’
