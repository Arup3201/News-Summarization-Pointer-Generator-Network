A government bureaucrat is currently being paid an astounding $28,000 a month for a job that no longer exists.

Louise Sylvan has been earning $300,000 a year since 2011 when she was appointed to the role of CEO of the Australian National Preventative Health Agency - which just shut down in June.

The Daily Telegraph reports that the bureaucrat no longer has official duties but still receives a salary because the five-year contract she signed doesnâ€™t expire until September 2016.

It is understood Ms Sylvan turned down a $200,000 redundancy package when it was announced that the agency was folding.

However, Ms Sylvan is not breaking any laws by receiving a salary unless there is a change in legislation which could then end her five-year contract.

The agency was formed by the then Kevin Rudd Labor government with more than 40 staff employed to provide grants and sponsor events that would help combat drinking and obesity, with a $5 million budget.

But the current Abbott Liberal government axed the agency this year and placed some of its initiatives with other government departments.

Ms Sylvan is said to have an office in a Department of Health building in Sydney where her total annual salary is $332,800 and her base wage is $242,950.

A spokesman for Health minister Peter Dutton confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that the agency the agency was now defunct but wouldn't comment on Ms Sylvan's situation.
