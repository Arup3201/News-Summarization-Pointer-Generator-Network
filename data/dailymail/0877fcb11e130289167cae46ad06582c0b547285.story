A baby gorilla raised by human surrogates who dressed in furry vests to mimic primates has celebrated her first birthday at an Ohio zoo.

The celebration for Gladys, who tucked 
into a rice and vegetable cake with sweet potato and banana 
frosting, marked a key milestone for the primate who has now been accepted by the zoo's other gorillas.

As Cincinnati Zoo keepers laid out her birthday cake
 this week, it was the gorilla's surrogate mom, M'Linzi, that led the 
still small Gladys to her treat.Â

Adorable
 footage showed the tiny creature tentatively chewing on a piece of 
fruit before leaning in to grab a huge mouthful of cake, smearing its 
puree frosting across her face.

Seeing Gladys enjoy her cake in the company of other gorillas was a proud moment for the Cincinnati keepers, who had acted as surrogates to her for five months.

When she was transferred to the zoo at the age of four weeks, after being rejected by her mother, staff worked in shifts to provide round-the-clock care.

As well as tending to her basic feeding and cleaning needs, keepers had to teach Gladys how to be a gorilla.

They
 wore specially made furry vests, walked on their hands and knees while 
the baby gorilla clung to them, and tried to teach her the low grunting 
sounds made by her species.

At
 five months old, Gladys was ready to be introduced to the zoo's main 
gorilla group, and she was paired up with 31-year-old M'Linzi.

Primate curator Ron Evans said helping to raise Gladys had been 'unlike anything I have experienced in my 30 years here'.

'It was the best experience of my life and something I hope we never have to do again.'

The success with Gladys is expected 
to help other zoos. The zoo has made 29 videos of her development 
for its YouTube channel.

A compilation video will be shared, said Dusty Lombardi, an animal care specialist in Columbus.

'We
 watched those. They were terrific,' said Roseann Giambro, primate 
keeper at the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium, where keepers 
hand-raised a baby gorilla for four months last year.

Cincinnati Zoo has asked fans of young Gladys to send in old cell phones as part of its Project Saving Species fund-raising campaign.
