A seriously ill pensioner was left on a trolley in a tiny office while nurses at an overrun hospital fielded calls about other patients and made coffee.

Great-grandmother Arleene Meekins was moved in to the tiny cluttered room as the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (N&N) was hit by a flood of patients on Tuesday morning - her 77th birthday.

The pensioner, who was battling a serious chest infection, was dumped for about four hours  - with nurses leaning over her to work - before she was finally taken to a ward at the 953-bed 14-year-old hospital.

The N&N said the room, which included desks, chairs and a telephone, was a 'home therapies clinic room and office' and only used while the hospital experienced 'increased bed pressure'

Until then she was forced to lie in her hospital bed as staff sat at a desk just feet away taking a stream of calls about other patients.

Workers also filed in and out to make tea and coffee while the room was crammed with filing cabinets, tables and chairs.

The crisis became so bad that one ambulance crew waited for more than four hours in the early hours of Tuesday morning to drop a patient off.

Seven other ambulances spent more than three hours queuing to hand over people at the hospital's emergency department as patients could not be discharged quickly enough.

Mrs Meekins was originally kept on a maternity ward when she first went to the N&N with a chest infection two weeks ago.

She was then shunted from the ward to the staff office at the Jack Pryor Unit, which treats kidney dialysis patients, for around four hours.

Her son, Philip Meekins, 46, of Norwich, said: 'It is ridiculous. I couldn't believe they'd put my mum in an office.'

Waiting times for cancer treatment and other operations are at their highest for six years as the crisis in A&E has infected the rest of the health service.

Experts warned that hospitals are now ‘stretched to the limit’ and said the situation is ‘critical’.

Some 13 hospitals across England declared major incidents last month as they were unable to cope with the numbers arriving in A&E.

Now a report by health think-tank The King’s Fund has found waiting times for tests and surgeries for non-emergency patients are at their worst level since December 2008. 

Her daughter-in-law, Shelley Meekins, 41, went to see Mrs Meekins at 11.30am on her 77th birthday to find her propped up on a bed in the staff area.

'I kicked up a right old stink when I got there,' said the carer.

'Poor Arlene was in a bed next to a load of cupboards.

'The staff had to lean across her to make a cup of coffee and the guy in the office was making calls on the phone to patients.

'She broke down and cried because there was just no dignity for her.'  

'The nurse even told me that she wouldn't want this for her mother,' she said.

'She said an overflow of ambulances had arrived and she said they just had to find beds.'

Mrs Meekins was finally moved to a ward.

'The powers that be need to be told that this is simply not good enough,' insisted Shelley.

A hospital spokesman apologised but said the devastated great-grandmother only spent a 'short time' in the 'home therapies clinic room and office'.

He said she was there from about 8am to 11.30am as besieged staff frantically strived to transfer her back to a ward.

'Prior to this time, the patient was cared for in a ward environment,' added the spokesman.

Her son, Philip Meekins, 46, of Norwich, (left) said: 'It is ridiculous.'I couldn't believe they'd put my mum in an office.'

'We have already apologised in person to the patient and her family.

'At the time, the trust was experiencing considerable bed pressure with many patients needing urgent admission to hospital.

'This room is a clinic room for the dialysis service and not routinely used for inpatients.'

Anthony Marsh, East of England Ambulance Service chief executive, admitted that hospital handover delays remained a serious issue.

The N&N said it was unable to divert patients to other local hospitals on Tuesday morning as they were also busy.

Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, simultaneously declared an 'internal critical incident' as it urged people to find alternatives to A&E.

The James Paget University Hospital at Gorleston, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was also under intense pressure and was on red alert.

Meanwhile, an N&N spokesman said that emergency admission areas remained 'extremely busy'.

'Our staff have been working very hard, alongside ambulance crews, to support patients while we continue to experience a high level of emergency demand,' the spokesman said.

'Being able to turn around ambulances depends on maintaining a flow of patients through the hospital and back to their own homes or to another care provider.'
