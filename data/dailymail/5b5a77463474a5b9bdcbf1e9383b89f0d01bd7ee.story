Andy Carrol's injury nightmare at West Ham continued on Thursday night after it emerged that he has torn the ligaments in his left ankle and will be out for at least four months.

In a huge blow to West Ham the striker, who cost them £15million last summer, will fly to America on Friday morning to undergo surgery with a specialist.

It is then expected that he will not return to action until December at the earliest, missing the crucial start of West Ham's campaign.

Blow: Andy Carroll is reportedly out for four months after tearing ligaments in his ankle

SEPTEMBER 2012Misses a month after straining a hamstring against Fulham

DECEMBER 2012Twists his knee against Man Utd and is out for two months

MAY 2013Falls awkwardly and damages his heel against Reading and is out for seven months

Carroll said on Thursday: 'Going under the knife and absolutely devastated to be missing the start of the season.'

The 25-year-old flew back to England from West Ham's pre-season tour of New Zealand after twisting his ankle badly.

He was set to have intensive treatment on it and club officials were hopeful that it was only a minor strain.

They were confident he would be fit for their first game of the season against Tottenham on August 16.

But after further investigation club doctors discovered that it is far worse than they initially feared and that the ankle required surgery.

The England international was unable to play last season until January after injuring his left heel and made only 16 appearances.

That injury had completely healed and he was gearing up for the start of the new campaign by heading out to New Zealand for the club's pre-season tour when this fresh injury struck in training. It is understood to be completely unrelated to the one he sustained 14 months ago.

In the last game of the 2012/13 season he ruptured the lateral plantar fascia – the tendons that run through the arch of the foot, connecting the heel to the toes – in his right foot leaping for a ball against Reading.

When he was thought to be on the mend, the medial one went and he was out for almost six months of the last campaign.

Having been on loan at the club from Liverpool for one season, West Ham pressed ahead to make the transfer permanent last summer in what Sam Allardyce described as a 'calculated risk.'

The West Ham manager was initially told that Carroll, who has won nine caps for England, would only be out until September but he ended up missing the entire first half of the season.

This was despite owner David Sullivan seeking out a top specialist, Lieven Maesschalck, and he spent time with the physiotherapist in Belgium to help his recovery.

It will be hugely frustrating for Allardyce that he will have to start a second successive season without his star striker.

Carroll has scored just two goals since he became their record signing and, on around £80,000 per week, their highest-paid player. He has so far cost them £1million per Premier League game.

Fans will be hoping that this is the last of his injury problems, with his contract set to run for another five years until 2019.
