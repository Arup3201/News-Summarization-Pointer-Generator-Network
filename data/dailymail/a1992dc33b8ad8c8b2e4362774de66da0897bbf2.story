Sky News is being investigated by Britain's TV watchdog after one of its star reporters rifled through the possessions of people killed when MH17 was shot down over Ukraine.

Ofcom has had 200 complaints since Colin Brazier inspected suitcases found where the Malaysian Airlines jet crashed, which included picking up a child's pink water flask, some keys and toiletries.

The broadcaster and Mr Brazier have both apologised after the incident in eastern Ukraine where the journalist himself seemed to realise his mistake saying: 'I shouldn't really be doing this, I suppose.'

Two days later he admitted 'a serious error of judgment' after being criticised by family members of a crash victim, who described his actions as 'sick' and David Cameron who called it 'completely inappropriate'.

Row: Sky News is now being investigated by Ofcom after Colin Brazier's controversial report from the MH17 crash site sparked 200 complaints

Report: Brazier picked up item's from a victim's suitcase but later admitted 'a serious error of judgment'

An Ofcom spokesman said: 'Ofcom received over 200 complaints about this news report. Having assessed these, there are grounds to investigate under our rule on potentially offensive material. As in all investigations, we will take relevant circumstances into account, including any action taken by the broadcaster, in reaching a decision.'

The broadcast, on July 20, was met with an outpouring of outrage on Twitter with many viewers calling it 'shocking' and 'disgusting'.

Speaking at the time, a Sky News spokeswoman said: 'Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on air. Both Colin and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused.'

Brazier is described by Sky News as one of its 'most widely travelled' reporters who has previously been honoured for his reporting in Afghanistan.

 During his live to air piece at the scene he spotted a victim's pink drinking flask that was identical to one possessed by his six-year-old daughter.

He then said he 'lost it' and broke out in tears while on air as he bent down to touch the victims' possessions.

Leeds University student Richard Mayne was one of ten Britons to die when the Malaysia Airlines jet crashed last month.

Speaking from the family home in Leicester, Richard Mayne’s older brother Thomas, 24, branded it 'sick' adding: 'I think it's totally out of order. It's not on.'

Mr Mayne said: 'It’s sick and the worst example of news journalism which is sensationalising an appalling human tragedy.

'It's really hard for us at the moment. The magnitude of it all and the way it happened. You don't think this sort of stuff happens to you.

Brazier later gave a moving account of coming across scores of human remains at the site.

An Australian was also criticised for touching clothes and debris from the MH17 plane crash has defended his actions saying 'it's not as though it's a crime scene'.

Phil Williams was shown handling victims' belongings in a report published on the ABC website.
