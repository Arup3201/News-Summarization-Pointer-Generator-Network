Read Martin Samuel's match report from Anfield as the Reds crashed out of the Champions League 

Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard pulled no punches as they admitted Liverpool deserve to be out of the Champions League.

A dismal return to Europe’s premier competition ended as 10-man Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by Basle at Anfield. They secured five points from their six games and are now condemned to the Europa League.

Liverpool were poor for most of the game and deservedly trailed to Fabian Frei’s first half goal and their task looked forlorn when Lazar Markovic was sent off before Gerrard set up a grandstand finish with a free-kick.

Steven Gerrard's free-kick gave Liverpool hope, but they couldn't find a second goal as they were eliminated

Gerrard admitted Liverpool have not been good enough during their Champions League campaign

They would have been fortunate to get through, however, and neither Rodgers or Gerrard were looking to make excuses.

‘The big game was away in Basle where we did not play well (and lost 1-0),’ said Rodgers. ‘We have no complaints. If you deserve to go through, you go through. We have not been good enough to go through. We have to take it on the chin.

‘When you don’t qualify everyone gets looked upon. We wanted to qualify. We have been analysed and for us the solution is we have to do better – manager and players – the expectancy was high but this is a different group of players and squad.’

Gerrard added: ‘We haven't gone out of the competition because of our performance tonight, we've gone out because away at Basle we weren't good enough, in our last game we conceded a stupid goal towards injury time.

‘You always qualify over the six games and unfortunately we haven't been good enough. We need to get our main striker Daniel Sturridge back and get some more goals in the side. We need to get Mario Balotelli back and firing.

‘That is not to take away anything from the lads who have played tonight and have slogged their guts out. Rickie Lambert has ran himself into the ground tonight, but it has just been a game too far tonight and that has been because of a lack of numbers.’

It could be that Liverpool’s best hope of qualifying for the Champions League next season is to win the Europa League. Rodgers has vowed to take the competition seriously.

Rodgers, who felt the red card for Markovic was a 'really, really poor' decision, added: ‘We want to do our best in the tournament. It is something we have to fight to do and something we will.

‘Of course it is managing expectation we have been out a long time and came in with a lot excitement and wanted to do well.   

'There will be disappointment tonight because we did not qualify but now we have to look to the rest of the season and make it a success and then at the end everyone will look at it and see where it is at.’
