Gunmen wearing camouflage and carrying weapons fitted with silencers reportedly burst into two

inside.

Victims: Police stand over the bodies of some of the 25 women murdered during a raid on a brothel in a upmarket district of Baghdad

Most of the victims appear to have been killed by gunshost wounds to the head. In
 one image the bodies of five women are seen slumped together on the 
floor of bathroom.

In another the bodies of eight women are seen lying 
in a pool of blood in what appears to be a living room. MailOnline has decided not to publish these images.

A message scrawled on a wall inside one of the apartments read: 'This is the fate of any prostitution.'

While
 no group has yet claimed responsibility for the murders, locals believe
 the killings were carried out by Shiite militants opposed to 
prostitution.

The gunmen, who are believed to be Shia militants, reportedly burst into two of these apartments murdering everbody inside

A
 police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said: 'When we walked
 up the stairs, we saw a couple of women's bodies and blood streaming 
down the stairs.

'We
 entered a flat and found bodies everywhere, some lying on the sofa, 
some on the ground, and one woman who apparently had tried to hide in a 
cupboard in the kitchen shot to death there.'

The attacks happened late on Saturday night at an apartment block in , a mixed Sunni and Shiite district of Baghdad.

Police
 believe men using silenced weapons carried out the executions, before 
scrawling 'this is the fate of any prostitution' on one of the doors.

Officers
 have now cordoned off the street, with residents reporting that the 
sole access point to the building has been blocked off.

Shiite
 militias have become more active on the streets of Baghdad since Sunni 
militants led by jihadist fighters took over large swathes of eastern 
and northern Iraq a month ago.

Gunmen in Baghdad have executed at least 29 people including 20 women in an apparent raid on a brothel

While nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, it is thought Shiite militants are behind it

Sunni ISIS fighters have seized most of the country's north, including all of its borders with Syria, in an attempt to set up a single Islamic state across country lines.

The sudden assault by ISIS earlier this year lead marches by Shiite Muslims in Iraq's capital in a show of defiance.

Violence is at its highest level in Iraq in recent years according to the UN, with 2,417 people killed in June, the majority of them civilians, the highest number since 2007.

The latest attacks in Baghdad mirror executions carried out by Shiite militias in May 2013 in the same district, when gunmen attacked brothels and alcohol shops.

Seven women and five men were killed on that occasion after gunmen burst into a brothel, while 12 shopkeepers died after militants restrained a nearby police officer before shooting them.

The deaths happened in the Zayouna district of Baghdad, the same district where seven women and five men were shot in a similar attack in May last year
