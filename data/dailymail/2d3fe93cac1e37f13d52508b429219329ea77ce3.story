A man was beaten and his pregnant wife was repeatedly raped by three men who broke into their home after mistaking it for their target's, police have said.

Kristopher Hughes, 20, Michon Thomas, 22, and Eric Bass, 23, had allegedly been planning to rob another house in the Carpenter-Ridgeway neighborhood of Madison, Wisconsin on February 23 after a woman, who was dating the owner, said they would find at least $1,500 there.

But even when the men realized they had broken into the wrong home, they still went ahead with the terrifying 50-minute attack on the unidentified man and woman.

Thomas, Bass and Hughes all
 face robbery and sexual assault charges in the case. Three others 
accused of helping plan and carry out the attack also have been charged.

Arrests: Kristopher Hughes, 20, left, and Michon Thomas, 22, right, allegedly broke into a home in Wisconsin after mistaking it for the home they were planning to rob. They allegedly attacked the home owners

One of the assailants wore a 'Scream' mask as they repeatedly threatened to kill the couple and when the woman told them she was pregnant, they held a gun to her stomach and said, 'You're going

The complaint says that while the 
couple struggled to sleep about 5am, the male 
victim, who is legally blind without his glasses, noticed the bedroom 
door was open and shouldn't have been.

'Is
 someone here?' the man called out from bed. A suspect then turned on 
the bedroom light and three men burst into the room demanding money.

'Someone's
 gonna die tonight,' one suspect said, according to the complaint. One 
suspect was allegedly wearing a mask from the movie 'Scream'.

The
 female victim told the three men repeatedly that she was pregnant, and 
that the men could take what they wanted from the house.

Reports
 say Hughes pulled the male victim from bed, laid him on his back and 
began hitting him in the face with a gun and punching and kicking his 
body.

Plot: Eric Bass, 23, left, also went inside the home and allegedly attacked the couple after Efemia Neumaier, right, told them that the homeowner left money around the house. But they went to the wrong address

'Co-conspirators': Police say the group made the plan at DeMarco Mallit's (left) apartment. They went there in a car rented by DeAndrae Mayweathers Jr., right, who said he didn't want to be involved in the robbery

Another suspect pulled
 the woman from bed and ordered her to lie on her stomach in the 
hallway, the report says. A suspect allegedly took a handgun and put it 
to the woman's stomach, saying, 'You're going to die tonight.'

All three men are accused of sexually assaulting the woman, and one is accused of forcing her to perform oral sex.

After
 putting the couple in a darkened laundry room, the complaint says the 
men left with electronics and the couple's credit cards and wedding 
rings.

The complaint says 
the men left in a rented Ford Fusion driven by DeAndrae L. Mayweathers 
Jr., who was charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery.

The
 victims ran to a neighbor's house for help, the man with what's 
described in the report as a baseball-sized contusion to his head and 
the woman bleeding from the assault.

Police
 said after interviewing neighbors that the alleged assailants planned a 'lick' on a man believed to carry large sums of money, but struck the 
wrong house.

Scene: The couple, who live in the Carpenter-Rideway neighborhood of Madison (pictured), were locked in a laundry room while the trio allegedly stole electronics, credit cards and wedding rings

'In my 27-plus years of policing in 
Madison, this is probably one of the most disturbing and heinous crimes I
 have ever seen,' interim Madison police Chief Randy Gaber said, the Wisconsin State Journal reported.

After the robbery, 
Neumaier aroused the man's suspicions when she told a police officer that he might have been the intended target, according to the criminal complaint.Â 

He then searched Neumaier's 
Facebook account, where he allegedly found messages about the plot.

Neumaier has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery.

A
 fifth man, DeMarco D. Mallit, has been charged with theft and aiding a 
felon. Investigators said the robbery was planned at his apartment.

Police
 said Mayweathers' girlfriend told them he wanted to drive the car 
because it was rented in his name, but that 'he did not want to be 
involved in (the robbery).'

Julie Foley, who manages victim and witness services for the district attorney's office, said they have provided support to the couple since the harrowing ordeal.

'These are remarkable people that will recover,' she said.
