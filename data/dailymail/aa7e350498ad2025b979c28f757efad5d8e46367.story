At Leeds station, a woman casually climbs onto the track of an oncoming train.

She trips 
over but seems more worried about her handbag than the hulking mass of metal approaching her.

Luckily for her, she makes it to the other side without getting hit.

CCTV footage from the same station shows a man in his twenties, probably 
drunk. He too dices with death 
by climbing down onto the track and blindly stumbling to the other side,
where he is hauled to safety.

But they, and others like them,
would do well to know that nearly 50 people have been killed after 
taking shortcuts and trespassing across railway lines in the last year, 
according to Network Rail.

Scroll down for the CCTV

Fortunately for her, she escaped unharmed - but there have been nearly 50 fatalities over the past year from people trespassing on tracks

Out of the 49 accidental deaths on 
railway lines between April 1 last year and March 31, 88 per cent were 
male with more than a third aged between 16 and 25.

And to illustrate the point, Network Rail has posted pictures of various people with a deathwish - such as a male jogger, in red top and black shorts, seen running alongside a track in Grangetown, Cardiff.

Just one stumble onto a live rail and he probably wouldn't be doing any running (or anything else) again.

Network Rail has also teamed 
up with 400m hurdles champion Dai Greene to warn people about the 
dangers of taking a shortcut across the tracks.

Greene appears in an online video as part of a campaign called Track Tests which is being launched today.

In it, he is shown struggling to run along tracks due to rain, grease on the line and other hazards, which aims to show that if a fit, agile athlete is unable to get out of the way of a train, then others will not have a chance.

Track Tests will also feature a Facebook page and mobile and online advertising campaign over the next four weeks.

Welshman Greene, who won gold at the World Championships last summer, said: 'Day in day out, I train hard to make sure I am as quick as I can be.

'On the running track, it’s important that my reactions are lightning fast but on the train track - during filming - that didn’t count for much.

'The experience has brought to life just how many dangers there are on the rail tracks - most of which I knew nothing about.

'I hope that this film really helps Network Rail to show people that taking the risk is never worth it.'

Dyan Crowther, Network Rail director of operational services, said: 'We know a lot of young men think that taking a shortcut isn’t really a risk, that they can get out of the way of any train but the fatality figures show they are wrong.

'Dai is one of the most fit and agile athletes in the world, someone that we know young men admire, particularly with the 2012 Games so close.

'His message and ours is simple - if he can’t survive the shortcut, you won’t either.'

The Network Rail figures exclude suicides and fatalities at level crossings and are subject to alteration following coroners’ inquests.

It also reported 445 near-misses during the period, with reports of people crossing the tracks to the opposite platform upon realising their train was leaving from there, jumping down to retrieve phones or wallets and walking alongside the tracks as a shortcut home.
