This dazzling array of diamonds and precious jewels is among a cache worth £90million stolen at gunpoint from a display in Cannes.

The jewels  - belonging to the Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev -  were on show at the same Cannes hotel featured in Alfred Hitchcock's 'To Catch a Thief' when a single gunman walked in to the ground floor show, threatened the handful of unarmed guards, and then disappeared down a side street with the loot, on July 28.

An affiliate of Lloyds of London has today released the images as it has announced it will offer a 1 million euro ($1.3 million) reward for information leading 
to the diamond collection.

They include a huge heart-shaped diamond pendant totalling 23.14 carats and handcrafted in platinum, two diamond-encrusted rings and an Art Deco style emerald and diamond necklace totalling 127.26 carats, hand crafted in platinum and 18 karat gold.

It has been reported that 72 pieces were stolen, with 34 items deemed 'exceptional.' It has been said that the thief lost some of the pieces while fleeing.

It includes these six extravagant and ornate items, including chokers, rings and pendants featuring hundreds of radiant-cut white diamonds, emeralds and 'fancy coloured diamonds'.

The pieces taken include a heart shaped white diamond pendant, totalling 23.14 carats and handcrafted in platinum, and an intricate diamond and emerald bead necklace totalling 127.26 carats, hand crafted in platinum and 18 karat gold.

The robber is said to have tipped the diamonds and other precious stone  into a briefcase during the raid in broad daylight at the Carlton in Cannes, said to be a favourite haunt of Hollywood’s biggest film stars.

The robber is said to have made off on foot through the exclusive Promenade de la Croisette.

The raid, on July 28, ranks among the largest jewel heists in history.

Organised gangs frequently target boutiques and hotels in and around Cannes.  In May, jewellery worth £1million was stolen from a hotel safe during the annual Cannes Film Festival.

An unnamed American woman working for Chopard, the Swiss jeweller and festival sponsor, was keeping the items in her second-floor room at the Cannes Novotel.

Chopard had 40 staff at Cannes who tried to persuade stars to wear its products. Among the a listers seen wearing Chopard pieces this year were Julianne Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne.

A few days later a necklace worth £1.6million vanished after a festival party in the neighbouring resort town of Cap d’Antibes.

The 343-room InterContinental Carlton is a favourite of the stars, and is considered the ‘celebrity HQ’ during the film festival.

In August 1994, three men firing machine guns burst into the Carlton and robbed its jewellery store. Later, it was discovered the gang were firing blanks.

There have been several high-profile jewellery thefts in Europe this year, including one at Brussels airport in February which saw £32million worth of diamonds taken.

Rewards for information leading to stolen jewellery have lead to success in the past.

In 2008, a $1 million reward was offered for information about a $105 million jewel heist from the Harry Winston store in Paris which resulted in more than half the stolen pieces being recovered.

Vashi Dominguez, a diamond expert based in London's Hatton Garden, told the Telegraph there is a two to three day window in whcih the diamonds can be traced before they disappear forever, adding: 'They will be swiftly cut, polished and turned into something different. It's easily done if the thieves have the right connections.'
