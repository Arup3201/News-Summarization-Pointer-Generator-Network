Grand National victor Ryan Mania is in a 'comfortable' condition after falling from a horse less than 24 hours after celebrating the biggest win of his career.

All eyes were on the jockey at yesterday’s races after his breathtaking win, but to the horror of spectators, the 23-year-old was hurled from his horse and airlifted to hospital with head and neck injuries.

Despite the fall, the jockey Tweeted from his hospital bed that he was feeling 'grand' but is expected to have to remain in hospital until Tuesday morning for close monitoring.

A hospital spokesman said he is 'currently in a comfortable condition'.

Lying motionless on the track, he was struck by one of the horses and kicked in the back by another.

Paramedics treated to him for 25 
minutes on the grass before he was strapped to a spinal board and 
airlifted to hospital.

His injuries were described as ‘severe/serious’ 
but his condition on arriving at hospital was ‘stable’, a spokesman for 
the Great North Air Ambulance service said.

In a Tweet he wrote last night: 'Thanks
so much for all the messages. I'm grand. Staying in hospital to get 
another scan tomorrow then should be home. #highsandlows.'

He later thanked the Great North Air Ambulance staff saying: 'Thank you so much for your help. Top blokes. Professional pilot.'

Mania was riding at Hexham in 
Northumberland, just hours after posing for photographs with his Grand 
National-winning mount Auroras Encore.

The jockey had to leave the photocall 
at his stables near Bingley, West Yorkshire, before the horse’s 
traditional trip to the local pub in order to get to the Hexham meeting 
on time.

The win made him a national hero, after he became the first Scot to win the Grand National since 1896.

His mother Lesley, 50, said yesterday 
the family had been celebrating his win in their hometown of Galashiels 
when they discovered the news.

She said: ‘I have spoken to his dad 
and the clerk of the course who say he came down heavily on his back and
may have been kicked between the shoulder blades by a horse.

‘He was down for some time which was really worrying but he is conscious and can feel all his limbs.

‘They used the air ambulance because 
Hexham’s course is out of the way and they didn’t want to take any 
chances but seemingly he’s fine – just very sore.’

His horse, Stagecoach
Jasper, came down early on the final circuit of the 3.10 race, after 
colliding with another mount.

TV presenter Clare Balding wrote on 
social networking site Twitter: ‘The highs & lows of jump racing – 
Ryan Mania wins the National yesterday, now being air lifted to hospital
after a heavy fall.’

Clerk of the Hexham course James 
Armstrong said: ‘All I can say at the moment is he’s conscious and 
talking and he is being taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in 
Newcastle for further assessment.’

The Great North Air Ambulance confirmed its aircraft based at Penrith, in Cumbria, attended the scene.

A spokesman said the jockey had back 
and neck injuries which were assessed as ‘severe/serious’ but he said 
his condition on arrival at hospital was described as stable. Mr 
Armstrong said later: ‘His agent and his partner are with him.

‘I know that he’s had some scans and they are waiting for the results but there’s no news more than that at the moment.’

Mania was scheduled to ride in two 
races, the St John Lee Handicap Hurdle and the Primary Websites Handicap
Chase with Twice Lucky, which he never made.

Racing was suspended while the air ambulance landed and Mania received treatment

After his National triumph, Mania 
said: ‘I couldn’t have asked for a better ride, and the old horse was 
loving it as well. I couldn’t believe, even at the Melling Road, that I 
was still there.

‘I was happy to be placed at that point, and then the front two stopped and I took off in front of them – it was unbelievable.’

His victory marked a dramatic 
turnaround in his career, which was temporarily halted when he spent six
months out of racing after his former boss Howard Johnson lost his 
training licence.

He was persuaded to return to racing by Sue Smith, who trained Auroras Encore, and her husband Harvey.

Last night, Mania’s agent Bruce 
Jeffrey tweeted: ‘News regarding jockey Ryan Mania, he will [be] 
detained overnight for precautionary MRI scan tomorrow morning.

‘Ryan and his family appreciate all the kind wishes and would like to thank you all very much.’
