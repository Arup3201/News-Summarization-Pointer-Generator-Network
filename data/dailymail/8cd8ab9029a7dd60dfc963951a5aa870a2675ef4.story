A disabled mother was devastated to find the front of her car had completely melted away after a Chinese lantern set fire to its bonnet in the early hours of New Year's Day.

Deborah Welsh, found her blue Toyota Yaris ablaze in the early hours of New Year's Day - and is now calling for the paper lights to be banned.

Firefighters used hose reels to tackle the fire, which had started when the lantern set wiper blades and plastic trim alight, before flames spread to the engine bay.

A passer-by saw the lantern land, and upon arrival firefighters confirmed that it had caused the fire.

The whole bonnet and engine have completely melted away and the car has been left badly damaged.

The fire service issued a warning about Chinese lanterns prior to the New Year celebrations, asking people to be aware of the risks.

The 48 year-old from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, said: 'I thought Chinese lanterns were banned, and I think they definitely should be after this.

Chinese lanterns have been responsible for other blazes

'I've got enough problems without this as I am disabled.

'I'm devastated, as I have no way to get around or get my son to school.'

A Humberside Fire and Rescue Service 
spokesman said: 'As this incident shows, Chinese lanterns can pose a 
real fire risk because there is no way of knowing where they will land.

'They could start fires which would then go undetected until serious damage had been caused, particularly in rural areas.

'They can also cause environmental damage and for those reasons we would recommend they are not used.'

This
 incident happened during the final stages of the most recent strike by 
Fire Brigades Union members, and was dealt with by a crew made up of 
firefighters and reservists.

Last year, a Chinese lantern sparked a massive fire at a recycling plant - causing £6million of damage.

West Midlands Fire and 
Rescue Service released CCTV video clips showing a small flaming 
object which investigators say is a paper lantern floating into the 
Jayplas recycling facility on an industrial estate in Smethwick, near 
Birmingham.

The resulting fire ripped through 
100,000 plastic bales which were awaiting recycling, sending a column of
 smoke 6,000ft into the sky.

Blaze: Deborah Welsh, was devastated to find her silver car ablaze in the early hours of New Years' Day

The region's chief fire officer Vijith
 Randeniya said the blaze at one point 
stretched resources to such an extent there was a single fire engine on 
standby to cover any other incidents across the West Midlands, with more
 than 200 firefighters called in to tackle the flames at the plant.

The blaze sparked 
calls for Chinese lanterns to be banned, with senior Liberal Democrat MP
 Tim Farron saying they were 'immensely dangerous'.

The MP, who has been campaigning for 
some time against their use because of farmers' concerns in his Cumbrian
 constituency about the impact on crops and livestock, said it had taken
 a major incident in an urban area to bring home the dangers of the 
lanterns.

He added it was 'extremely lucky' that no one was killed.

Damaged: The bumper and the front of the car has completely melted away

Labour West Bromwich MP Tom Watson said the lanterns were 'just not safe', and also called for a ban.

In 2011, a Chinese lantern set light to a home as a family slept inside.

Anne-Marie Cobb, 40, and her children Samuel, eight, and Amelia, six, were asleep when the blaze took hold at 11.15pm in Trowbridge, Wiltshire.

The paper lantern landed on a partly-built extension to the rear of the property and set fire to the insulation in the roof.

A timber frame for the extension then also caught fire - just 2ft from where Amelia was sleeping.

Fortunately a neighbour spotted the flames, dialled 999 and helped evacuate the family.

Another mother also called for a ban after her son was nearly blinded by one.

Boiling wax fell from a Chinese lantern and landed on three-year-old Cael Jones’ face, almost blinding him.

The freak accident left him with appalling 
burns.
