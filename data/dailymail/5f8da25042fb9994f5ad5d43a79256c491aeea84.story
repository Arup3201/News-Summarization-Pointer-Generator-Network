English raspberries have made what is thought to be their earliest-ever appearance on supermarket shelves after the sunniest winter on record.

Waitrose will stock the Chichester glasshouse-grown Diamond Jubilee berries from today, claiming it is the first time consumers have been able to enjoy locally grown varieties in March.

The berries are grown in glasshouses by Harry Hall, who supplied the supermarket with the first strawberries of the season earlier this month.

The early delivery is thanks to the weather this winter, which the Met Office has said was the sunniest since records began in 1929

Laurence Olins, of industry body British Summer Fruits, said: 'This is probably the earliest we've seen English raspberries.'

Waitrose raspberry buyer Nicki Baggott said: 'It's incredibly unusual to have these ready in March, but a combination of growing techniques and perfect weather means we can sell these juicy delights earlier than ever.' 

Just 200kg of the berries are expected this week, but there should be around a tonne produced every week afterwards.

The early delivery follows British-grown strawberries becoming available weeks earlier than previous years.

This is thanks to the weather this winter, which the Met Office has said was the sunniest since records began in 1929.

The figures for rainfall and temperature were average, but the number of sunny days was 125% of the long-term average.  

Raspberries were once regarded as a late summer crop, but British Summer Fruits said growers are using new varieties and innovative methods to extend the season.
