In court: Brian Copsey lived in one of London's most exclusive mansion flats and was finance chairman of its management board

A resident of one of London’s most exclusive mansion flats has appeared in court accused of stealing more than £1million from the building’s management company.

Brian Copsey, 59, was finance chairman of Bryanston Court Management, a collective of residents who manage a luxury apartment block in Marble Arch, central London.

Copsey is charged with plundering cash from the company and using it for his own purposes between March 2010 and October last year.

Appearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today, Copsey spoke only to confirm his name.

Prosecutor Rajan Barot said: ‘The allegation in this case is that the defendant was acting in a fiduciary capacity as director of a management company.

‘In that role he was finance chairman. Over a period of two and a half years he has transferred more than £1m out of residents’ accounts for the company and used it for his own purposes.’

Bryanston Court Management is a registered company with the shareholders made up of residents. 

They filed accounts showing cash assets of £1,735,405 in 2011.

An unfurnished two-bedroom flat in Bryanston Court, George Street, would cost nearly £1 million.

Copsey, of Bryanston Court, George Street, Marble Arch, is charged with fraud by abuse of position, and attempting to launder the stolen cash between different accounts.

He was bailed to return to court on April 3 for a committal hearing on condition he report twice weekly to Paddington Green Police Station, resides at his home address and does not apply for travel documents or leave the country.
