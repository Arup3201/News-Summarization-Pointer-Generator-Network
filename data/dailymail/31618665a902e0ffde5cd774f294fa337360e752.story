The last time Boris Johnson played football he tripped up a child.

Today as he took part in a game at Millwall he appeared determined to wrong foot David Cameron.

The London Mayor wore a personalised number 10 shirt, suggesting his real goal is to end up in Downing Street as PM.

Eyebrows will have been raised by his short number, suggesting he could have his sights set on Number 10 Downing Street

Mr Johnson took part in a game of football during a visit to the Millwall Football Club Community Trust.

Known as a political bruiser, he did not let up in battle for the ball during the game at the Lions Centre, Bolina Road.

Mr Cameron famously once hailed his leadership rival as a key player in the Tory team.

'I think he's great,' the Prime Minister said last year. 'It's a bit like football - if you have got a great striker you want him on the pitch.'

Mr Johnson is standing to become an MP again in May's general election, sparking speculation he is positioning himself as a potential Tory leader if Mr Cameron is ousted. 

Still in his suit trousers and black leather shoes, Mr Johnson brought his unique style of play to the pitch

Friends of the London Mayor insist he wants to see Mr Cameron back in Number 10 as Prime Minister after the election.

But his choice of shirt will certainly raise eyebrows among nervous Tory aides who fear a power struggle, especially if a Conservative minority government runs into trouble.

In October last year Mr Johnson took the rough and tumble of politics to the football pitch when he sent a nine-year-old stumbling to the floor in a friendly kick-about.

The London Mayor joined in a children's match to promote a new health report aiming to get more kids involved in sport.

But after seeing one youngster knock the ball past him Mr Johnson stuck his leg out, tripping him up, sparking shouts of 'Referee!' from the side-lines.
