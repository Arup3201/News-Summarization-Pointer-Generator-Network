The first-half performance against Slovenia on Saturday does not mean England should ditch their diamond formation — they just need to use it better.

Roy Hodgson’s side struggled in the opening 45 minutes, which led some to suggest that the solution is a return to using wingers.

But I think to get a diamond system to prosper, you need to get your best players on the ball in between the lines, in the most dangerous parts of the pitch.

That’s where England failed. Look at the touch map of Raheem Sterling’s night: he barely touched the ball in the danger zone just outside the Slovenian penalty area. England need to get him on the ball more. 

This system is all about having an extra man in the middle of the park and England need to use whoever is best for that. They also need to play with a lot more purpose and pace from the off. They only did that once they had conceded.

I can’t remember many England debuts as good as Nathaniel Clyne’s. He deserves to keep the shirt. Kieran Gibbs did well but needs to go forward with the same conviction.
