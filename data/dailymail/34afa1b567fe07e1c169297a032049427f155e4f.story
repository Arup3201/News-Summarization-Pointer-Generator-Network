There's always been an unwritten rule that, if in a committed relationship, thou shalt not play tonsil-tennis with another person, allow them to put their hands or tongues on your body, nor put their bits anywhere near yours.

The equation was simple: sex = infidelity.

But now 'cheating' has taken on a whole new meaning, and it's mostly thanks to social media.

Emotional infidelity - deep, passionate connections between people who often aren't even aware they've crossed the line from platonic friendship to romantic love - is turning out to be the biggest threat marriage has ever faced.

Social media has blurred the definition of 'cheating', and just because you're not actually having sex with someone else doesn't mean you're not being unfaithful to your partner by flirting with other men

Facebook and Twitter, with their 'harmless' online flirtations, never-quite-forgotten old flame reunions and 'friends' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners, have made emotional cheating more possible

Emotional infidelity wasn't part of our grandparents' consciousness because the only member of the opposite sex available to flirt with was either your best friends' husband or your husbands' best friend.

Infidelity rose sharply the second women swelled the workforce and expanded the choice of available extra-marital partners.

Then along came Facebook and Twitter, and with it 'harmless' online flirtations, never-quite-forgotten old flame reunions ('It's just a coffee') and 'friends' who seem to care more about our lives than our partners.

It's no wonder the lines of infidelity have blurred into a messy blob with which Rorschach would have had a heyday.

Intense but invisible, erotic but unconsumed - emotional infidelity is dangerous, addictive and way too easy to get away with.

With such blurry boundaries, it's hard to know what's acceptable and what's not.

Are you an emotional cheat?

Answer 'yes' to a few of the following and you're swimming in dangerous waters...

Do you act available? The more you talk about your partner to others, the less available you'll seem

Do you share intimate details of your life with people you fancy? It's one thing dissecting relationships with same sex friends (or opposite sex friends if you're gay) but another discussing personal things with someone you've got a 'thing' for

It's usually women who are guilty of emotional cheating, since women get more emotionally involved and are keen to test it out, to see if this could be better than her current situation

Eight questions to see if you are being emotionally unfaithful

@highlight

Do you talk negatively about your partner to a 'special' friend? You're effectively saying 'I could be lured away from this relationship because it's not ideal'.

@highlight

Do you act available? The more you talk about your partner to others, the less available you'll seem. Conveniently forget to mention you're involved with someone and people will react to you as though you're single.

@highlight

Do you have one rule for you, one rule for them? We all want our cake and to eat it too though we justify this by saying if we're flirting with someone, we know it's innocent. We're also very good at deluding ourselves something's innocent when it's not.

@highlight

Do you regularly indulge in sexual fantasies about someone else? I don't actually think there's anything intrinsically wrong with being unfaithful in your head, but some experts say fantasy sex can make you want the person even more. The whole point of fantasies, after all, is to conjure up brilliantly perfect sex!

@highlight

Do you keep secrets? Do you have secret email accounts, passwords and a lock on your phone? In an open, honest relationship, ideally no communication should be secret.

@highlight

Do you share intimate details of your life with people you fancy? It's one thing dissecting and analyzing your relationships with same sex friends (or opposite sex friends if you're gay) but quite another discussing deeply personal things with someone you've got a 'thing' for. Emotional closeness swiftly moves into romantic dependence.

@highlight

Are you female? It tends to be the woman who pushes the affair from friendship to love, from fantasy to actuality, according to psychologists. Women get more emotionally involved and are keen to test it out, to see if this could be better than her current situation.

@highlight

Do you lie to your partner about seeing other people? If your partner's feeling a little threatened by the amount of time you're spending with your new best 'friend', do you continue seeing them and lie? A good question to ask to keep you on the straight and narrow: If my partner saw me right now, would they be upset? Would you be tempted to lie about what you're doing? If yes, stop it!
