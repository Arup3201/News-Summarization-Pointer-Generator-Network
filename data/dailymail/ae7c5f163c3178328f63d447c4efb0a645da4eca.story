Fears over Everton striker Arouna Kone's knee injury have been allayed after scans revealed it was not serious.

The Ivorian was substituted late in Sunday's 2-1 win at QPR and with the 31-year-old having a history of knee problems, missing 14 months after one such injury last season, there was concern over his latest issue.

However, the club have confirmed tests on the player determined no long-term damage.
