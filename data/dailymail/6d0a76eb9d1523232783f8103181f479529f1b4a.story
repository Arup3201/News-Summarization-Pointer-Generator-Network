Original sketches used to plan some of the most iconic scenes of the Star Wars film trilogy have sold for $16,000.

The pencil storyboard drawings imagine famous clips from the blockbusters including the moment young hero Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, attacks Darth Vader's Death Star in 1977's Episode IV: A New Hope.

The landspeeder that Luke flies on the planet Tatooine in the same film was among the drawings for sale, as was one of a menacing Imperial Forces' At-At Walker from the 1980 follow-up The Empire Strikes Back.

The pencil sketches show George Lucas' idea about how Luke Skywalker was going to destroy the Death Star

The detailed sketches show exactly the shots Lucas wanted in the final movie 

The final film is remarkably faithful to the elements on the story board in many of the key scenes

Also for sale were sketches of the famous lightsaber battle in which Darth Vader tells Luke that he is his father after chopping off his hand.

Skywalker then voluntarily jumped down an air shaft rather than be persuaded the join the dark side at the climax of the second film.

The images were used during the making of the films to put together storyboards and to help the set designers create the real life props.

The drawings from the first film were done by artist Joe Johnston, who went on to become a film director in his own right with credits including Jurassic Park III, Jumangi and Hidalgo.

It is not known who drew the sketches from the two follow-up films.

They were sold individually to private collectors in a sale held by Californian auction house Profiles in History.

In the same auction an original edition of the first ever Star Wars poster expected to sell for $800 went for almost $4,000.

Joe Maddalena, from Profiles in History, said: 'Star Wars was George Lucas's baby and so he was very involved in the design process. The artists got closer and closer to his vision and when he approved the drawings they literally were made in real life.

'Once they had the vision on paper it came true on film.

'At the time these artists were just doing their jobs - they weren't thinking that this film would become one of the most iconic ever made.

'But now we know these storyboards were the beginnings of some of the greatest movie scenes of all time.

'It's amazing to see their humble beginnings.

'What's amazing about these preliminary sketches is just how close they are to the finished product.

'A lot of this stuff has come directly from people who worked on the films and took their sketches home once the production was done.

'These were drawn in the days before movie memorabilia was big so it's amazing they've survived all this time.'
