Tragic: Schoolgirl Isabel Pearce, pictured, died after choking on a meatball from her school canteen

A 13-year-old girl who suffered from a rare form of autism died after choking on a meatball from her school canteen.

Isabel Pearce never regained consciousness after eating the meal at Ridge View School for special needs children in Tonbridge, Kent, during a regular lunchtime last month.

The schoolgirl suffered from a rare form of autism and Sotos Syndrome and died in hospital on January 27 - the day after the incident - leaving her parents, Anthony and Jane Pearce, devastated.

Mr Pearce, 56, from Ide Hill, in Sevenoaks, Kent, said her death was incomprehensible.

'It is unbelievable that it could happen. You send your child off to school - to somewhere you imagine is safe,' he said.

'She was in a good place. She was not at all compromised in any way - to any degree - that could have caused this to happen.

'Her condition did not affect how she was able to swallow. It could not have been further from the truth.'

Mrs Pearce, 56, added: 'I still expect to her to come in - I suppose it is something in my brain.

'On the day it happened she was not ill, she just went to school and never came home. I hugged her. I don't normally do that. I put her in the taxi that morning. 

'Her hair had been washed and she did look really beautiful.'

Kent Police confirmed it is looking into the circumstances surrounding the teenagers sudden death. 

A spokesman from the force said: 'Kent Police is currently reviewing the death of a 13-year-old girl and is liaising with the coroner's officer as part of the coronial process.'

'We understand it is normal procedure for the police to be involved in a review of an unexpected death and the school is co-operating fully with the police over this.'
