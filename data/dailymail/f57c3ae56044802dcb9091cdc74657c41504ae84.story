She's been in the industry for more than 20 years, runs her own blog and was handpicked to style TU at Sainsbury's tenth anniversary collection, so it's safe to say that Louise Redknapp knows a thing or two about fashion.

FEMAIL wanted to tap into Louise's magic so we've snapped her (and her best friend and business partner Emma Thatcher) up to serve as MailOnline's resident style gurus.

The duo, who run A Style Album with their friends, will be sharing their top tips on fashion, beauty, interior and all things style.

When Louise met Emma through their husbands they quickly bonded over their love of fashion.

'Emma and I got to the stage where we would constantly text each other pictures of what we were wearing or what we wanted to buy,' explained 40-year-old Louise.

And now they want to share their passion with MailOnline readers. 

'For me, knowing that you could show one of your friends something and get an honest opinion - especially  when I was working or doing a red carpet without a stylist - was great. 

'Em and our circle of friends would offer me advice and it made me feel so much more confident.

'That's what we want our blog to be: like an online mate.' 

Louise has launched trend blog, A Style Album, with former Matches Fashion stylist Emma Thatcher

Louise and Emma want their blog to be an 'online mate' for women who work and lead busy lives but still want to be stylish. They also want to appeal to a wide audience, including older women who love fashion

Louise, who is married to football legend Jamie Redknapp, and Emma, who worked as a stylist for Matches Fashion and works as a Fashion Buyer for a boutique called Club, added: 'We're not saying we're fashion experts.

'We're saying that we're interested in it and bringing it to the masses who, like us, do have busy lives, have work, have children and still want to be in style.'

The pair, whose personal blog is loved by the likes of Cat Deeley, say they want to help give women that 'little bit of morning inspiration' when it comes to dressing.

'We can all lose confidence and I definitely think that when you've had children  you lose your way for a little while afterwards,' admitted Louise, who is mother to two boys Charley, 10, and Beau, 4.

Louise and Emma also want to appeal to a wide audience, including older women who love fashion.

'It's just about wearing your clothes in a way that suits you,' said Louise. 'My mum loves my wardrobe and nine times out of 10 she can be spotted in my clothes. 

'She's in her 60s and she looks great, a lot of times better than me!'

'We can all lose confidence and I definitely think that when you've had children you lose your way for a little while afterwards,' admits Louise, who is mother to two young boys, and wants to help give women a little 'morning inspiration' 

The pair emphasise that you can wear whatever you want; it's all in the styling. 

If you're 19 and you want to wear leather trousers, the stylish duo recommend wearing them with a crop top and stilettos. If you're 60, wear them with a cute  court shoe and a blazer.

'You'd have to be a multi-millionaire to always be fashionable but to be stylish, it's just about accessorising to suit your figure and your age,' Louise said.

So what should we all be channelling come spring? Bright, bold colours and playful prints, Louise and Emma advise. 

They also loved the romantic elements on the Chloe catwalk and think Victoria Beckham has done 'brilliantly'. 

Louise said: 'Her shop is incredible and she's completely respected. I take my hat off to her because she was really up against it and a lot of people wanted her to fail and I know how much hard work goes into being successful. 

'She's got a great eye and is quite particular and has definitely grown into herself.' 

As well as offering fashion tips, the blog will delve into beauty, too.

After launching and running her own organic make-up brand, Wild About Beauty, which is loved by the likes of Princess Beatrice, Louise is extremely well-placed to share her advice. 

Louise said: 'I've loved working on Wild About Beauty and I've learnt a lot, which has really helped with blogging because you have to be aware of what's going on around you and trends.'
