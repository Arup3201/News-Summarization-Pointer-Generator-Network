Dating can be a nerve-wracking occasion for any new couple, but it seems the President of the United States managed to impress the First Lady from the first date.

Barack Obama took Michelle for lunch at the Art Institute of Chicago in Michigan, before a leisurely stroll to the movies to watch a 1989 Spike Lee film which had just been released. 

The Obamas gave an interview recalling the first time they went out for dinner as a promotion for a competition the president's campaign is running, offering winners the chance to dine with him and his wife.

Smooth operator: A clip from the video showing the couple laughing - in the video they told how Barack Obama took Michelle for lunch at the Art Institute of Chicago in Michigan

The 1minute 40 video clip posted online begins with Michelle Obama recalling: 'It was a cool date, we spent the whole day together, he was showing me all facets of his character. We went to the Art Institute.'

At which point Barack Obama, wearing a white shirt and striped tie, nods enthusiastically, points his finger at the camera and says: 'Art - guys out there, it impresses people.'

Mrs Obama then says that the couple, who married in 1992, 'took a nice long walk down Michigan Avenue' and again Mr Obama smiles and gives a knowing nod to camera saying 'romantic.'

The First Lady, who is wearing her trademark pearls and a patterned sheer top, then asks Mr Obama 'Did we go to the movie first?'

He thinks for a second and then replies: 'Uh we didn't have dinner we actually had lunch at the Art Institute, there was a little courtyard, with a little fountain.'

Mrs Obama smiles and says 'Yeah that was nice' and Mr Obama agrees: 'Yeah it was very nice.'

Winning formula: Their first date progressed into further dates and the couple married in October 1992

The president continues: 'Then we went to see Do The Right Thing' 

And Mrs Obama nods saying 'Spike Lee - it had just come out. '

'He showed all the sides - he was hip, cutting edge, cultural, sensitive. The fountain - nice touch,' she continues.

Promotion: Mr Obama's campaign have launched a competition for a winner to have 'dinner with President Obama, along with a guest of your choice and four other supporters'

'The walk - patient,' she adds.

Mr Obama grins, shrugs his shoulders, looks at the camera and says 'Take tips gentleman' before winking.

The interview coincides with a competition his Obama For America campaign have launched which offers winners the opportunity to have 'dinner with President Obama, along with a guest of your choice and four other supporters.' 

The winners will each receive round-trip tickets for them and a guest from within the fifty U.S. States, DC, or Puerto Rico to a destination to be determined by the sponsor.

They will stay in a hotel and have dinner with the president and his wife at an undisclosed location  - the competition states that the package is worth about $4,800.

It is not the first time Mr Obama has offered to have dinner with competition winners - earlier this year he dined with a competition winner and George Clooney at the film star's Los Angeles mansion to raise funds for his 2012 re-election campaign.

A seat at the A-list dinner, which took place on May 10, was also available without entry into the competition for a reported $40,000 a head.
