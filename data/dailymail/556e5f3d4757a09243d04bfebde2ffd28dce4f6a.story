Crystal Palace and Swansea are keen on Hamilton's rising star Stephen Hendrie.

The talented left-back is already being tipped to follow in the footsteps of Hull City's Andrew Robertson who has flourished since his £2.8million move from Dundee United and developed into Scotland's first choice.

Scouts from both clubs watched Hendrie in a behind-closed-doors friendly at West Bromwich Albion earlier this month and were at Saturday's victory over St Mirren.

Cardiff have also watched Hendrie who is valued at around £2m by the Scottish Premiership side.

The 19-year-old has been part of Hamilton's first team since 2011 and has also featured for Scotland's youth teams.

Hendrie made his debut for Scotland Under 21s in September and has featured for them twice more in the months since. 

Hendrie, still only 19-years-old, has represented Scotland at Under 17, Under 19 and Under 21 level
