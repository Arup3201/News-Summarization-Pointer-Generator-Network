The red squirrel is a British native but the little animal is quickly becoming a rare sight in our gardens.

Only five per cent of Britons have ever spotted a red squirrel outside their home, a new wildlife survey has found.

And only 2.7 per cent said they see a red squirrel on a monthly basis.

The results also found that you would be more likely to spot a squirrel living in rural Scotland - a stronghold for the species but those living in the Midlands have less than a one per cent chance of seeing the animal.

The figures were released after 274,000 homeowners took part in the RSPB's Big Garden Birdwatch survey.

The project has tracked 
garden birds every year since 1976 - but this is the first time the RSPB
 has asked participants about other wildlife.

The map shows the distribution of squirrels across the UK. In 2010, red and grey squirrels no longer populate the east of England. The map also illustrates that the red squirrel population has continued to grow in Scotland

RSPB conservation scientist Dr Daniel Hayhow described the figures as 'shocking'. He said: 'We all know that red squirrels have been threatened for a long time, but these figures are quite shocking.'

The comment came after the survey found that invasive American grey squirrels are seen in 90 per cent of gardens.

The number of red squirrels has dwindled after the species was hit by a pox virus, carried by the grey squirrel. The red squirrel also requires more dense woodland than the grey.

A hedgehog snuffling up to the back door was also once a common sight - but it is rapidly becoming a thing of the past.

One in five people have never seen hedgehogs in their gardens, the survey found.

The startling figures confirm conservationists' fears - that the small British mammal is suffering a huge decline.

Scientists think there are now fewer than a million hedgehogs in the UK, a 30 per cent fall since 2003.

The survey found that 21 per cent of people never see hedgehogs at all, and only 28 per cent spot them more than once a month.

Two thirds of participants never see badgers, a quarter never see common toads and 93 per cent never see red squirrels.

Daniel Hayhow, RSPB conservation scientist, said the survey showed how important gardens were for wildlife.

He added: 'It is a big concern that so many people never see hedgehogs, a species that is so familiar to us.

'The fact that they are not seen regularly even in rural gardens is quite troubling.

'This is the first time we have included wider species in our annual survey. The results provide a baseline for us to monitor how hedgehogs do over the next few years.'

The reasons behind hedgehogs' decline are unclear, but ecologists think the loss of the woodlands and hedgerows where they live, the building of new roads and houses, and the fragmentation of the countryside could all be to blame.

The common frog leaped into first place as the most abundant garden amphibian - with half of people in the UK recording that they saw one at least monthly, regardless of whether they lived in a rural, suburban or urban area.

A wildlife expert said: 'The fact that they are not seen regularly even in rural gardens is quite troubling'

In contrast, toads were seen by only 28 per cent of people monthly and numbers have declined, especially in central and southern England.

The creatures are more likely to be seen in gardens in rural areas, where 41 per cent of householders recording that they saw toads on a monthly basis.

Animal charities are trying to encourage people to provide space for wildlife in their gardens, whether by building a hedgehog box, putting up bird feeder, or finding a space for a pond.

David Wembridge, of the People's Trust for Endangered Species, said: 'We know that only a minority of gardens are regularly used by hedgehogs - one species we're particularly concerned about.

'With numbers falling in the wider countryside, doing more to encourage hedgehogs into the green spaces around our homes and places of work could make a big difference.'

Worrying: Two thirds of participants never see badgers, while a quarter claimed they never see common toads

The Cornwall Red Squirrel Project is one of many initiatives in the UK that aims to reintroduce the native red squirrel.

The last native red squirrel was seen in the county in 1984.

But as Cornwall has large areas of mixed woodland and valleys, it is an ideal habitat for red squirrels.

In 2009, the project was founded and began with a cull of grey squirrels.

This will be followed by the reintroductions of red squirrels to The Lizard and West Penwith.

Surrounded by the sea on both sides, these areas are more easily defended from re-population by grey squirrels.

At the same time, a cull of grey squirrels was carried out in the area to give the red squirrels a chance to reclaim their habitat.

Removing grey squirrels also allowed trees and woodland to grow back - the grey squirrels strip the bark from the stems of trees, causing huge damage to biodiversity.

The project is supported by the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, whose patron is HRH The Prince of Wales, and the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust.
