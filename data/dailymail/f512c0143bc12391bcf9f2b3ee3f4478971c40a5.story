The global chief executive of McDonald’s has claimed he lost 20lbs in weight – despite eating from the chain’s menu every day.

Don Thompson said he regularly worked out at a gym to lose the pounds but did not stop wolfing down the fast food meals  whenever he could.

But his claims were met with scepticism on Twitter with some branding it the ‘McDiet’ and  asking him to ‘prove it’.

Last week McDonald’s unveiled its 
most unhealthy item ever, the Mega Potato, which is a double size 
portion of fries. At 1,142  calories it is more than half the 
recommended daily calorie intake for a woman.

Mr Thompson said he shed the weight over the course of a year by getting up early in the mornings and going to the gym.

The fast food boss insisted he still 
ate at McDonald’s ‘every single day’, although he did not specify what 
he chose from the menu.

He admitted that despite McDonald’s 
trying to rebrand itself as healthier, its salads make up only two to 
three per cent of sales.

But he claimed the company was making efforts to include more vegetables in its meals.

Thompson, who has been on the job for less than a year, was responding to a question about how the company is adapting amid growing concerns about obesity when he pointed out his slimmer frame.

He said that he lost the weight by getting active again and noted that it's rare to see Europeans that are 'very, very heavy' because they walk a lot.

'And so I think that balance is really important to people,' he said.

'I don't see salads as being a major 
growth driver in the near future,' Thompson told investors in New York 
on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg News.

It's no wonder the salads have failed to lure health conscious diners when they are often as
 fat-laden as a Big Mac and boast names such as Bacon Ranch and 
Southwest Crispy Chicken.

Salad: McDonald's has already dropped two salads from its menu and will likely drop more after the dismal sales performance

New focus: The chain's CEO said it will likely refocus advertising on burgers and chicken sandwiches which sell better than salads

In comparison to poor salad sales, the restaurant's Dollar Menu generates 13 to 14 per cent of U.S. business, he said.

But
 he claims the company isn't giving up on selling fruit and vegetables. 
For instance, some of McDonald's new McWraps have tomato, cucumber 
slices and shredded lettuce inside, he said.

McDonald's first added tossed salads to its U.S. menu in 1987.

Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that it is considered ditching Caesar salads after it already got rid of Fruit & Walnut salads from its menu this year.

McDonald's shares fell more than 2.2 per cent to close at $98.28 on Wednesday, after the announcement. At one point they declined as much as 2.9 per cent for the biggest intraday drop since October 19 and they continued to fall on Thursday.

The shares gained 15 per cent this year 
through to Tuesday. In comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index 
advanced 16 per cent.

The world's biggest hamburger chain announced it was axing its Fruit & Walnut salad in March after competitors Burger King Worldwide Inc and Wendy's Co began closing the gap with McDonald's.

The world's biggest hamburger chain for years held a huge lead against most rivals, but some of those chains now are luring away diners with fast-changing menus featuring tempting new food.
