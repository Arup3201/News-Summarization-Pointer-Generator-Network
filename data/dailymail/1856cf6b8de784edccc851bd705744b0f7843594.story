At first glance, Sara and Erin Foster would seem to be your average Hollywood blondes - tall, willowy and blessed by the genetic gods.

But these are truly funny girls. And for the past two years, the sisters have been working on what is being talked about as the new must-watch comedy of the season.

Barely Famous takes two vacuous sisters, played by Sara and Erin, and sends them up as they star in their own reality show - although the characters seem determined to ignore this fact as much as possible.

Showbiz royalty: Erin and Sara are the daughter of legendary music producer David Foster, seen together in 2008. Their new show, a mockumentary reality show, is 'about Hollywood and the desperation to be famous', says actress Sara

Desperate to get on the Hollywood A List, Sara and Erin's alter-egos find themselves breaking into Courteney Cox's home, trying to coax free designer bags away from Kate Hudson and looking down on anyone who appears on reality TV - even though they're starring on their own show.

As the daughters of legendary music producer David Foster, Sara, 34, and Erin, 32, grew up rubbing shoulders with showbiz royalty.

Indeed, their step-mother is Yolanda Foster, of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fame, and their step-sisters are models Gigi and Bella Hadid.

But actress Sara - who appeared on 90210 - is quick to stress: 'We're not spoofing Housewives, or any franchise. This show is about Hollywood and the desperation to be famous, we're pulling the curtain back.'

Married to tennis player Tommy Haas with a young daughter Valentina, Sara adds: 'I watch reality TV and I'm not judging anyone who goes on it, but the thought of having my personal life on TV and that being my job is not for me.'

Barely Famous launches on March 18 as one of VH1's first scripted shows, and Erin, who was a writer on NBC comedy The New Normal, says: 'It's really a mockumentary about two sisters who say they would never do a reality show, but they are actually starring on their own show and won't admit it anyone.

'We are not being mean spirited, we're poking fun of a culture that is such a huge part of our lives today. 

'Without judgement, we're in a really crazy time right now, you become famous first and then you figure out what you want to do with it. It's a really backwards way of having a career.'

She adds: 'There is no skill involved in acquiring a million Instagram followers, although that's a job now, you actually get paid for it, it's ridiculous.

Pretty in pink

Here at Fashion Finder HQ we're pretty excited about Barely Famous. Not just for the sure-to-be hilarious script and famous cameos, but also because if these outfits are anything to go by then we are in for a treat!

Posing with her sister Sara, here Erin looks effortlessly chic in her outfit of an oversized baby pink blouse tucked into a matching pencil skirt. The clean lines and soft palette is giving us major outfit inspiration.

The satin blush shirt sets itself from other blouses on the market with its exaggerated relaxed feel, loosely cut shape and tapered sleeves – topped off with a plunge for a further minimal feel.

If you're after a bargain, then take a gander at the fashion edit below where you'll find affordable versions from the likes of NYDY at Nordstrom and Calvin Klein at Zappos. We'll be styling ours with denim cut offs and sneakers all spring/summer long.

'There is this voyeuristic obsession and what we forget is that people show you the parts of their lives they want you to know about and they hide the parts they don't want you to know about.

'This makes a regular person feel like a celebrity has a perfect life or relationship or career or body and they forget there are all these apps involved in making you believe it.'

'We wanted to make a show that was light and fun, but showed the neuroses between two people filming a reality show and the strategies and manipulation behind it,' Erin says.

'Nothing on the show is pulled from a real experience, it's pulled from things that you witness in LA, like you go to a hair salon and you're made to wait an hour and a half because a celebrity just decides to turn up. Everything's status related and you can be made to feel like a real loser!'  

Despite living in LA, both sisters - who have another sister, Jordan - are down to earth.

They were brought up in the San Fernando Valley by their mother Rebecca Dyer, David's second wife, as Sara notes: 'Our parents divorced when we were five and we lived with our mom in the Valley. Our mom was a single mom with three kids and she struggled, so we didn't have the life that people assume.' 

And Erin agrees: 'Your environment is not as influential as the people you are raised by and we were raised by two people who were very grounded, strong and present parents.

'My sisters and I grew up in LA and none of us ever went to rehab, got pregnant, got a DUI - and we never got into trouble! We are a testament to our parents.'

Music producer David has won 16 Grammys and produced superstars including Barbra Streisand, Christina Aguilera, Whitney Houston and Jennifer Lopez. 

Friends in high places: Sara and Erin Foster got their childhood pal Nicole Richie on board as well and she makes a guest spot in Barely Famous 

Characters: Erin and Sara Foster play two sisters, aptly named Erin and Sara, desperate to be famous, who sign up for a reality show - but refuse to acknowledge that fact

Family: The Foster sisters step-mother is Yolanda Foster, of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Fame, and their step-sister is rising model Gigi Hadid

Erin says: 'Our dad is wonderful, he's such a good example to have grown up watching. He was really young, 13, when he dropped out of high school and became a professional musician. He was around the music scene in 1970s and '80s and he never touched a drug and he doesn't really drink.

'Our mother is totally removed from Hollywood, she looks beautiful and natural for her age and she has no interest in fame.

'We weren't raised around an obsession with fame, it's so destructive. If anything, we were raised to believe that's NOT what success looks like. It's not everyone knowing your name.'

As for their step-sister Gigi, 19, who was recently named model of the year, Erin says: 'Gigi deserves all the success in the world, she's getting recognition for something she's doing well.

'We're so proud of her, no-one deserves this more than she does.'  

During filming, Sara and Erin called upon famous friends including Sara's best friend Kate Hudson, childhood pal Nicole Richie, Jessica Alba, Molly Sims, Ashley Benson and Milla Jovovich.

Erin says: 'When we developed the show, everyone was excited. You're made to take yourself so seriously all the time and they got to have fun.' 

Reality bites: Yolanda Foster appears on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and her husband has made infrequent appearances - and he has also appeared on the Princes of Malibu

Sara appears in a scene where she attempts to blag a free designer bag - only to be trumped by Kate Hudson, sniffing: 'She got nominated for an Oscar 15 years ago.'

And she says: 'It was so fun to be in a scene where we have to pretend we don't know each other, fighting and taking the p***s out of celebrity culture - like she needs another free bag!'

The girls have poured all their heart into the show and Sara readily admits: 'This is our baby, we've given it our blood, sweat and tears.'

Barely Famous debuts on March 18 at 9:30/8:30c on VH1.
