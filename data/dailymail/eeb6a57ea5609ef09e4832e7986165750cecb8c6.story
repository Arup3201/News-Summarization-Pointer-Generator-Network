An aristocrat was deemed mentally unfit to face charges of theft and criminal damage today and taken from court to hospital by ambulance.

David Brudenell-Bruce, the 8th Earl of Cardigan, was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly damaging pheasant feeders, stealing a battery and an electrical power unit.

Brudenell-Bruce, 59, is alleged to have caused £66 damage to a number of pheasant feeders belonging to James Tilly.

The Earl appeared at Salisbury Magistrates' Court today accused of damaging and stealing property belonging to a neighbour.

The Earl looked dishevelled in the dock, and appeared to be in some considerable distress.

Miss Marie-Claire Amuah, defending, told the court: 'My client is unfit to plead today. I am certainly unable to take instruction from him.'

Brudenell-Bruce was declared unfit to plead by a special District Judge brought in from London.

Jennie Bradley, a court assessment officer and psychiatric nurse, said: 'He is psychologically unwell, but does not need to be detained under the mental health act or any an enforced admission to hospital.'

She added that his risk of committing suicide was 'fairly low at the moment.'

Judge Emma Arbuthnot declared the multi-millionaire unfit to plead and adjourned the case so he could visit a nearby hospital.

Judge Arbuthnot granted Brudenell-Bruce bail until his next hearing, but imposed two conditions requested by prosecutor Vyvyan Thatchers.

The judge ruled he cannot contact or come within 50 metres of five specific people who live on his 4,500-acre Savernake Estate, including Mr Tilly.

The Savernake Estate, which includes a stately home and Britain's only privately-owned forest, has been in the Earl's family for almost 1,000 years.

Brudenell-Bruce was later taken from court by ambulance to a nearby hospital, on the advice of the judge.

His case was adjourned until July 12, when he will appear at court in Swindon.

The aristocrat appeared in the same court last week, accused of beating a trustee of his estate, near Marlborough, in Wiltshire.

Brudenell-Bruce allegedly battered barrister's clerk John Moore in April, a week after a high court legal wrangle between the pair was resolved by a High Court judge.

The Earl lost the case, in which he accused his former friend of stealing millions of pounds worth of paintings from his extensive family estate, and allegedly took his frustration out on Mr Moore.

Brudenell-Bruce last appeared before Salisbury Magistrates' Court last Tuesday, on charges of common assault and criminal damage, but that case was adjourned until October for trial.

The Earl's daughter, musician Bo Bruce - runner-up on BBC talent show The Voice - may be called to give evidence in that trial, as hers was among a list of five names given to magistrates as possible witnesses.

Miss Bruce, 27, whose real name is Catherine Brudenell-Bruce, was runner-up on BBC talent show The Voice earlier this month.

Since publication of this article, Lord Cardigan has asked to make clear that the judge did not order him to attend at a mental hospital. He asked to go to the nearest general hospital because he had been denied his medication.
