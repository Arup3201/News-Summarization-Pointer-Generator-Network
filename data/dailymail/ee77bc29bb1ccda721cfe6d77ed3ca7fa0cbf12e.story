Labour plans for a ‘tourist tax’ would mean millions of families could no longer afford to take ‘staycations’ in the UK, ministers warned last night.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said a ‘levy on overnight accommodation’ would hit thousands of businesses in the tourist sector.

The proposal, put forward by Ed Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet ally Sadiq Khan and backed by some Labour councils, would potentially see a tax placed on all hotel, bed and breakfast and self-catering accommodation.

Sadiq Khan's suggestion of a 'levy on overnight accommodation' would leave families unable to afford 'staycations' in the UK, the Conservatives have warned (pictured B&Bs in Blackpool)

Similar taxes in the United States are typically levied at 10 per cent of the price of a room.

If Labour adopted a similar rate it would add £10 to the cost of a £100 hotel room. A family staying in a £90-a-night room would pay an extra £126 in tax for a two-week holiday.

Mrs Miller said: ‘Labour’s plans will make having a holiday here far more expensive, which will drive people elsewhere and do terrible damage to this country’s tourism industry.’

Mr Pickles also rejected the idea. ‘This will destroy jobs in coastal towns and popular tourist destinations across the country,’ he said.

Labour considered the idea of a tourist tax while in government but dropped the idea after criticism from the tourism industry.

But Mr Khan revived the idea in a newspaper article. He suggested it could be piloted in London.

‘We could tailor a tourism contribution that works for the tourism industry, doesn’t penalise local people and has the sole purpose of improving and promoting the city,’ he said.

A number of Labour councils are also still pushing the idea.

Theo Blackwell of Camden Council said even a modest £1-a-night charge would raise £4million a year in the borough.

But Martin Couchman, of the British Hospitality Association, said any new tax would damage an industry already suffering one of the highest VAT rates in Europe.

He said a modest tax would barely be worth collecting while a larger tax would deter tourists.

A Labour source last night insisted the party was not formally backing a tourist tax.

The source said: ‘Sadiq Khan was highlighting the need for London to have greater control of its finances. A tourist contribution is not Labour Party policy.’
