A seven-year-old lost his tooth with some help from his golf enthusiast father who came up with an unconventional way to yank it out.

Noah, who has dental floss tied to both his loose tooth and a Nike golf ball, looks at the camera anxiously as his father Phil Smith explains how he plans to hit the ball to extract the tooth.

Phil Smith posted the video of the yanking to his YouTube channel on December 30 which went viral with over 100,000 views.

Hitting it loose: Phil Smith says that when he hits this Nike golf ball his son's tooth should come out 

'Noah, are you ready?' says Smith before hitting the club.

Noah nods on reluctantly with his eyes tightly shut. 

Smith hits the ball and the tooth is gone in just seconds, made evident by the pained expression in Noah's face.

'yeah I jerked it,' Noah says of the tooth which flies from his mouth.

Noah then goes to grab the fallen tooth which got stuck to a stick while on the ground.

While this trick worked for Noah, it may be a dangerous feat to try at home.
