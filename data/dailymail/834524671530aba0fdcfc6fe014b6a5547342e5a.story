An Australian doctor has been struck off after he prescribed a drug to 'cure' a teenager's homosexuality.

Mark Craddock, 75, from Sydney was found
guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct over his treatment of the
18-year-old in a 10-minute consultation at his home in 2008.

Dr Craddock, who practised in the radiology field, and the patient were both members of the conservative Christian group Exclusive Brethren, which shuns TV, radio and the internet and do not vote.

In a letter to a Health Care Complaints 
Commission, the teenager said that when he revealed he was gay, aged 18, a
church leader told him 'there's medication you can go on'.

He visited Dr Craddock who prescribed Cyprostat, a drug used to treat prostate cancer and manage sexual deviation by reducing testosterone, it was alleged.

The commission found that the doctor failed to physically examine the patient, take a medical history and refer him to a counsellor or psychologist.

He also did not arrange a follow up with the patient to see if he was suffering from any side effects.

Dr Craddock admitted most of the particulars of the complaint.

The committee said: 'The outcome of this inquiry was that Dr Craddock was found guilty of unsatisfactory processional conduct. He was severely reprimanded and practice restrictions were placed on his registration.'
