A company boss whose PR firm who has represented the Dalai Lama launched a Willy Wonka-style audition to give his business away so he could stay home to look at his children. 

Simon Cohen, 35, said that when his wife, Kate, became pregnant with their second child, he wanted to leave his job to be with his wife and children.  

It meant he was left with the difficult decision of what to do with the company he founded 11 years ago, Global Tolerance.

He feared that selling it or merging it with another PR firm could 'disregard' the 'vision and values' of the business. 

And so he held a rigorous two-month process to find a successor to take over the £1m company that has clients including the Dalai Lama, Princes Charles and the United Nations. 

He will hand over 95 per cent of the company, with £10,000, and 11 years' worth of business contacts.

After a thorough five-stage process, he chose Noa Gafni, a World Economic Forum employee and Rosie Warin, a PR director from Forster Communications.

Mr Cohen, who moved to Cornwall from Brighton six months ago, told the MailOnline: 'I am delighted with the decision that has been made. It has been a surreal and scary process and it has been a bit weird. 

'But Rosie and Noa have really reinforced my confidence and commitment that the right decision has been made. They have got that sparkle in their eyes and the determination to make it work and move the business forward for the next decade and beyond.

'Through Global Tolerance, I’ve been able to work with people like the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu. I’ve had a great ride, but it’s time to pass on the baton.'

Mr Cohen, who has a 15 month old daughter called Seren and whose wife is due to give birth in November, said he was looking forward to being a 'stay at home Dad' but was also eager to visit South America.

'I am just looking forward to being a Dad that is present every day. At some point I would love to go to South America, that would be brilliant, especially the carnival in Rio. But there is still lots to do in the UK as well.'

Mr Cohen, who married Kate in August 2011, will do communications consultancy work one day a week to pay the bills. He will also keep five per cent of the company's shares. 

He decided to give his business away because he said the vast majority of mergers and acquisitions fail.

He said: 'It’s amazing to me how many companies express certain values, but when it comes to exit, those values are left at the door. In a world of discerning customers, this is a disaster for brand and customer loyalty - and the long-term value of the company. 

'For entrepreneurs who believe in their company’s mission, seeing those values live on is worth more than any amount of cash.' 

To land the job, the two successful applicants had to go through a rigorous process. The first stage asked for a tweet about leadership and the second stage asked for an online application form. 

This was followed by a Skype interview, where Mr Cohen interviewed 25 separate applicants for 15 minutes each. For the fourth stage, he brought in advisers to help him whittle down the remaining candidates, before a final stage - where applicants had to set out their business plan - on a boat on the River Thames. 

Mr Cohen said it was important the process was thorough as he wanted it to serve as a model for others to follow.

'I wanted to make sure it was a serious search as I care passionately about it. I also want other businesses to take it seriously and so it can be a model for others who want to make sure their companies keep their values.' 

Mr Cohen has worked with clients such as the Dalai Lama and Prince Charles during his 11 year period as the head of PR firm, Global Tolerance
