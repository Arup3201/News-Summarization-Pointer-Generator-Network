Found all over the world, natural pearls
 have long been prized for their beauty and have been worn by everyone 
from Cleopatra to the Queen.

From the pearl-drop earring worn by Charles I to his execution in 1649 to the delicate cultured pearl necklace presented to Marylin Monroe by Joe DiMaggio in 1954, the history of the gem is more exciting than their innocuous cream shimmer would suggest.

Now the V&A is to bring the history of the pearl to life with a new exhibition that will feature 200 different pieces of pearl jewellery.

The exhibition includes a necklace owned by Marylin Monroe and an earring worn by King Charles I (above)

Along with Monroe's necklace and Charles I's earring, the exhibition, which is to be held in conjunction with the Qatar Museums Authority, will also feature pieces made in ancient Rome, Greece and Persia, where pearls were used to indicate rank.

Later on in the medieval period, pearls became a Christian symbol representing purity and chastity, as seen in the Annunciation scene featured on the Hylle Jewel.

But the Renaissance saw pearls make a return to the jeweller's table, when they became popular among members of the aristocracy.

One of the most famous pearl-wearers of the era was the tragic English queen, Anne Boleyn, who famously wore a choker of pearls with a delicate 'B' pendant below.

Although Boleyn's pearls are not included in the exhibition, an earring worn by fellow executed royal, Charles I, will be.

Later pieces include a spectacular Cartier necklace of Gulf pearls, a regal diamond and pearl tiara and a lavishly embroidered Marharajah's coat from India.

Not everything on display at the V&A will be pearls however. Also part of the exhibition are paintings and portrait miniatures featuring nobles, courtiers and affluent merchants of society - all adorned with the gems.

Pearls, a V&A and Qatar Museums Authority exhibition, runs from 21 September 2013 until the 19 January 2014 as part of the Qatar UK 2013 Year of Culture, vam.ac.uk/pearls
