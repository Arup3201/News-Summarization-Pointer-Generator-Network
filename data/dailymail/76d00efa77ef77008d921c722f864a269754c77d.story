Inter Milan are making another attempt to prise Stevan Jovetic away from Manchester City.

They have been rebuffed twice already for the striker, who signed for City last summer in a deal worth £22million.

Jovetic has only managed five starts for the Premier League champions, but managed six goals during his first season at the club.

The Montenegro international is well respected in Italy after spending a successful five seasons with Fiorentina.

Inter are making a third bid for the striker, having already tried to draw him to Milan on both a loan deal and as a permanent signing.
