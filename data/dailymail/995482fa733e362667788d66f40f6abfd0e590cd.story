David Cameron promised to roll out the red carpet for the French when they announced a 75 per cent tax on the super-rich.

Well, Mr Prime Minister, it’s time to get the hoover out.

One of France’s richest men has announced he is moving to London – on the same day his country’s socialist government set its new rate.

Alain Afflelou, who made a 
£150million fortune from running an international chain of opticians, 
joins a growing list of wealthy French quitting the country.

The 64-year-old, however, claims he 
is not moving abroad because of the new tax regime, but to ‘oversee the 
development’ of his business in northern Europe.

In a statement to employees, Mr Afflelou said: ‘As you know, our group has had a new UK majority shareholder since July.

‘It is at its request that I moved to
London for a specified period. It is by no means tax exile. I already 
spend more than 40 per cent of my time abroad for the purposes of the 
group... so nothing new.’

But the fact his announcement came at 
the very moment the French National Assembly approved plans for high 
taxes on those earning more than £800,000 a year will only add to 
speculation that Mr Afflelou is the latest in a growing list of wealthy 
tax exiles.

France’s most famous actor Gerard 
Depardieu has already put up his £50million Paris mansion for sale and 
moved to Belgium to avoid the unprecedented tax rate.

Prime Minister 
Jean-Marc Ayrault has attacked the exodus. He said: ‘Those who moved 
aboard aren’t afraid of becoming poor.

It’s because they want to become 
even richer.’

Depardieu threatened to give up his French passport after Mr Ayrault branded him ‘unpatriotic’ for leaving the country.

Getting away from it all: The French actor is seen arriving in Rome yesterday

France’s richest man, Bernard 
Arnault, who runs luxury goods brand LVMH, applied for Belgian 
nationality in September. His decision to leave France prompted the 
Left-wing newspaper Liberation to run a front page headline, ‘Get lost, 
rich bastard!’

President Francois Hollande insists tax hikes are crucial to easing the country’s £24billion deficit.
The 75 per cent rate on earning over 
£800,000 will make France the highest taxing country in the EU.

He has 
added new charges on capital gains, a bigger wealth tax, a boost to 
inheritance charges and an exit tax for entrepreneurs selling their 
companies.

Mr Afflelou – ‘the King of Glasses’ – is the French 
equivalent of Richard Branson. His name adorns shops throughout French 
high streets and the shirts of some of the country’s biggest football 
teams.

Born to French colonists in Algeria 
in 1948, his family arrived in France as refugees from the bitter war of
independence in 1962.

After training as an optician he opened his first
store in 1972 in Bordeaux aged 24.

Today, his business empire stretches across nine southern Europe countries, into Africa.
A member of elite French  society, the
tycoon has mixed with politicians and celebrities and has dated 
various models. He has been married twice.

His first wife was Polish 
celebrity dancer Alexandra Lorska, with whom he had a son in 1991. 

His second was former Dutch model 
Rosalie van Breemen, a former wife of French film star Alain Delon.

They
married in 2002 but divorced in 2008 after she wrote a book which 
advised how to get over a divorce and how to get the appropriate 
financial settlement. He is currently with another partner, Christine 
Couland.

In June, Mr Cameron said: ‘If the 
French go ahead with a 75 per cent top rate of tax we will roll out the 
red carpet and welcome more French businesses to Britain and they can 
pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and 
everything else.’
