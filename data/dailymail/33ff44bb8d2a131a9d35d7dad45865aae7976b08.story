It must have seemed like such a good idea at the time to the European team’s brains trust, pairing the plucky local hero with the seasoned campaigner who can transform himself into Superman once every two years.

Unfortunately, nine holes later, Stephen Gallacher and Ian Poulter seemed to be going through some sort of conscious uncoupling, as they fell four behind the youngest ever partnership to take to the course for an American Ryder Cup team.

It was an example of Anglo-Scottish collaboration that would have appealed more to Alex Salmond than the Better Together campaign, and by the 14th green they were shaking hands with young tyros Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed.

0820: Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy vs Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson - USA 1UP after 18

This looked like an example of modern sport’s tendency towards paralysis by analysis.

Paul McGinley and his five vice-captains must have looked at this from a hundred different angles, and still managed to come up with a combination that simply did not work. Factors such as Gallacher feeling the pressure in this elevated company before a crowd that yearned for him to succeed, and of Poulter arriving here with desperately little form appeared to weigh heavily.

As Spieth ventured afterwards, it was a major morale booster for the Americans to take down the local specialist and the man who has caused them so much misery in recent editions.

Poulter even offered an unlikely note of introspection afterwards as he explained that the plan was always for him to sit out the afternoon foursomes instead of trying to play five matches.

‘Not many people have been able to play five and the reason is it’s very tiring,’ he said. ‘I’m 38, we’ve got some younger pups on the team that might be able to do it better than I can.’

Poulter should not be written off as three times before he has lost his first match before coming back to wreak damage. But he has never lost one as heavily as this, unable to contribute so much as a birdie in the course of a 5&4 defeat. By the time the Euro pair slightly revived after the turn, the huge galleries recognised the match as a lost cause and could not muster much in the way of support.

Ian Poulter was unable to salvage anything for Europe on Friday morning, losing a tough 5&4 against USA

7.35am: Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson v Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar 

7.50am: Jamie Donaldson and Lee Westwood v Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan 

8.05am: Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer v Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth 

8.20am: Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter v Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler

Many duos would have struggled against the Americans who, despite being the first US partnership both aged 25 or below, went round the first 11 holes in six under par, playing with the absence of fear that youth can bring.

‘When you’re playing against guys who are rolling putts in then they are going to be very hard to beat,’ said Poulter, who pointed out how they dovetailed. ‘They ham-and-egged very well. Obviously my record has been pretty good and has taken a dent. But this is a team game, not just about singling one or two guys out.’

You would need a heart of stone not to feel for Gallacher, who was followed round by his Ryder Cup legend uncle Bernard, lending his vast experience to his radio commentary duties. 

His nephew admitted afterwards: ‘Your first Ryder Cup there’s a bit of excitement and you don’t know what to expect. It took me maybe about five or six holes to get into it. I was a bit out of rhythm. It was a special reception on the first tee, something that I will definitely remember for the rest of my life.’

That was short-lived as he pushed his tee shot wide towards the huge corporate construct and then watched as Poulter missed an easy two-footer on the first green.

No amount of adrenaline could get either player going after that, and it may have been that Poulter was so pre-occupied with discovering any kind of form for himself that he was unable to give his rookie partner the benefit of his experience.
