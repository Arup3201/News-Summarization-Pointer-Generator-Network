Former Bradford and Wakefield half-back Ben Jeffries has pulled out of a move to Championship leaders Leigh for injury and family reasons.

The 33-year-old, who returned to Australia at the end of the 2012 season to work in the mines and play part-time rugby, was due to join the Centurions on a two-year deal from December.

Leigh head of rugby Derek Beaumont said: 'It is very honest of Ben to contact us and notify us of his recent significant injury with a torn bicep.

'A combination of that and how it impacts on his family situation means that he unable to join us at Leigh Centurions. I am sure he would have been a great asset to the club and we wish him well for a speedy recovery.

'We will hold his registration in the UK for the duration of the contract that he signed but we hope that should he recovery from the injury he will be able to play again in Australia.'

Leigh, who will make a push to regain their place in Super League next year, will step up their search for a replacement and in the meantime have re-signed second rower Sam Hopkins on a season-long loan from Wigan.
