Professional and amateur clubs around the country have united to commemorate one of the most iconic moments of World War I - the 1914 Christmas Truce football match between English and German soldiers.

Teams joined together for a pre-match photo of intermingling players that will be uploaded to social media websites this weekend as part of the 'Football Remembers' series of events. The so-called 'Moment of History' project images will then be shown at the website www.FootballRemembers.com.

It is almost 100 years since, on Christmas Day, soldiers in the First World War stopped fighting, exchanged gifts, sang carols and played football in no-man's land.

The Football Remembers project has been supported by  the Premier League, Football Association and Football League and will continue until 2018. 

More than 30,000 schools were sent an education pack which included resources to help children learn about the Christmas Truce and football's role in recruitment and morale during the First World War.

The HRH The Duke of Cambridge is supporting the project, he said: 'The British Council, together with The FA, Premier League and Football League, have put together a tremendous resource for use in the classroom and at home.

'It promises to be a powerful way to engage and educate young people about such an important moment in our history.

'We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms on Christmas Day, and it remains wholly relevant today as a message of hope over adversity, even in the bleakest of times.'
