An Amish couple from Ohio who were sent to prison for hair-cutting attacks on other followers, have revealed how prison life gave them new experiences.

Farmers Raymond and Kathryn Miller, who were part of a breakaway sect put on trial in 2011, have been introduced to public transport, fitness classes and even Mountain Dew soda.

And although their Bergholz property has no electricity, the couple have even had a phone line installed so they can keep in contact with their probation officer.

Changes: Kathryn and Raymond Miller were exposed to new experiences while in prison

Different world: Before prison, the Millers had not been exposed to pool, public transport, or Mountain Dew

Raymond Miller said that while in prison he developed a taste for Mountain Dew soda, got his 
GED, and wonders if he should get a pool table after learning to play in
 prison.

Kathryn, who had never ridden a public bus before boarding one 
last year to go to prison for forcibly cutting the hair of her 
relatives, was introduced to yoga and step classes while behind bars.

The
 Millers
are trying to settle back into life at home after being exposed in 
prison to a world their religion is focused on locking out.

The Amish shun modern technology and regard beards for men and uncut hair for married women as sacred.

A temporary exception to this rule has had to be made for 29-year-old Raymond Miller, who must make daily calls to his probation officer and wear an electronic ankle monitor while harvesting hay.

'I’m ready to get rid of it,' Raymond said of the telephone installed in his home. 'We get salesman calls about electric bills and they don’t believe that we don’t have an electric bill.'

Trial: The Millers were among members of an Amish sect, some of them pictured above during the trial, who were charged with hate crimes after cutting off men's beards

The 
couple, who were recently released after spending nearly a year in 
prison, were part of a group of 16 Amish from Bergholz who were 
convicted in 2012 of hate crimes for the hair-cutting attacks.

The victims included Raymond Miller's parents.

Prosecutors
 said the attacks were intended to humiliate and were carried out in 
retaliation for personal and spiritual disagreements that Bergholz's 
bishop and leader Sam Mullet had with Amish in other groups.

Mullet, who was portrayed as extremely authoritarian, is serving 15 years as mastermind of the attacks.

His followers were sentenced to one to seven years each. Defense lawyers did not deny the hair-cutting took place but said that hate crime charges were over-reaching.

One thing both of the Millers had to get accustomed to in prison was the concept of free time, something the Amish do not have a lot of at home.

'I read, played softball and played pool. I liked pool and I was pretty good at it,' Raymond said.

'I think we could get a pool table at Sam’s,' he said, referring to Mullet's home, which has a large meeting room for church services. 'I think it would be all right.'

Kathryn, 25, who also learned the game, shook her head 'no' in the background.

'I like to play pool but we are not allowed to play pool here,' Kathryn said. 'The girls in prison gave me a hard time that I was gambling.'

Changes: Laundry dries outside the Millers' farm. They have no electricity but since being released from prison on probation they have had to install a telephone line

Trade up: A buggy the couple use to get around. Kathryn's first experience of public transport was when she took the bus to prison

Raymond lost weight in prison because he did not like the food, but says he did develop a liking for Mountain Dew.

Kathryn had to leave her three young children in the care of her mother while she was in prison.

Her now nearly three-year-old daughter sometimes calls Kathryn's mother 'mom' even though Kathryn has been home two months. 'She still asks for my mom a lot,' she said.

Kathryn said she wore a smaller head covering than her typical Amish bonnet while in prison, along with long brown dresses.

She uses prison slang and referred to fellow prisoners as 'cellies' and 'bunkies' and talked about the SHU, or solitary housing unit.

'I didn't feel like I was Amish,' she said.

Knowing that she would be returning soon to her family kept Kathryn going. She also discovered yoga and step classes.

The Millers said they do not regret going to trial, but do not believe it was fair and are appealing their convictions.

'We really didn't have a jury of our peers,' Raymond said. 'They don't know about the Amish, the lifestyle.'
