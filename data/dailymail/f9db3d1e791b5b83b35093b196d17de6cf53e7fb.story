He has successfully evaded capture for nearly three months while trekking 730 miles across mountains, deserts and highways.

But, for once, this is not the case of the fugitive gunman doing his utmost to escape the police.

It is the journey of a lovesick wolf who has become a media and internet celebrity in America during his epic search for a mate - taking him across most of Oregon despite a 'dead or alive' bounty on his head.

Path of true love: The wolf has traipsed more than 700miles across Oregon's rugged terrain and highways in search of a mate

In the dock: Wolves from the Imnaha pack on the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest in northeastern Oregon. A two-year-old left the pack shortly before the others were issued with a death warrant for killing cattle

He left his home on September 10 just before state officials served a death warrant on members of his pack for killing cattle.

And while some have grown fond of his antics, it is feared he will be targeted by poachers or government hunters.

OR-7, as he has been unlovingly dubbed, captured the imagination of Americans after the conservation group Oregon Wild mapped his journey on its website and Facebook page.

They have begun a competition to give the wolf a name - hoping it will make him too famous to shoot. One entry came up with: 'Whoseafraida'.

But some are not so keen.

Cattle rancher Nathan Jackson, who ranches near Upper Klamath Lake, said: 'In this country, we worked really hard to exterminate wolves 50 years ago or so, and there was a reason.

'A lot of people who don't have a direct tie to the agricultural community tend to view wolves as majestic, beautiful creatures. They don't seem so majestic and beautiful when they are ripping apart calves and colts.'

Keeping an eye out: Russ Morgan, a wolf co-ordinator for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, with a female wolf pup just fitted with a radio collar - as was OR-7, which has enabled officials to track its movements

Last February, OR-7 was in a snowy 
canyon in north-eastern Oregon when a state biologist shot him with a 
tranquilizer dart from a helicopter before fitting him with a tracking 
collar and blue ear tags.

Officials
have been able to chart his journey from GPS positions transmitted from
the collar. They show he has traveled 730 miles on his meandering 
route, getting as far as 320 miles from home. Each time he enters a new 
area, he makes it onto the local news.

OR-7 set out on his trek just before 
state wildlife officials issued a death warrant for members of his 
Imnaha pack for killing cattle.

The
kill order specifically mentions OR-7's father, the alpha male, and one
younger wolf with no collar. Since OR-7 and two siblings took off that 
would leave his mother and one pup.

The
department reports a government hunter had a shot, but missed and did 
not get another before conservation groups won a stay of the kill order 
while their legal challenge is settled by the Oregon Court of Appeals.

Tough trek: The wolf climbed up into Oregon's Cascade Mountains (pictured) on his journey. At one point, a hunter shot at him, but missed

Wolves started moving into Oregon from Idaho in the late 1990s from packs introduced into the Northern Rockies as part of a federal endangered species restoration program.Â 

From trail cameras, radio tracking collar data and sightings, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife figures the state has at least 23 wolves.

All four packs are in the north-eastern corner of the state. Two produced pups this year.

Federal protection for wolves was lifted in Eastern Oregon, but they remain under state protection. West of Interstate 97, they are back under federal protection.

Most of the wanderers become 'biological dead ends', but even if OR-7 dies alone, the trail of scent posts he has left will be followed by others.

Wolves typically strike out on their own when they reach two years old to look for a mate and empty territory they can call their own.

Once in the Cascade Range, OR-7 meandered through the Rogue-Umpqua Divide, where Oregon's last known wolf was shot by a bounty hunter in 1946.

He skirted Crater Lake National Park and dropped down to the flatlands near Upper Klamath Lake, climbed back up in the Cascades, and crossed over the crest south of Mount McLaughlin, a snow-capped volcano visible from Interstate 5.

So far there have been no reports of cattle killing along his path.

Russ Morgan, the wolf co-ordinator for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, has been surprised by the way the public has embraced the wandering wolf.

He said: 'With all that's going on right now with management of wolves in Oregon, this is kind of a different side that people across the state have taken a shine to.'

OR-7's travels are not unusual, said Ed Bangs, the retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wolf co-ordinator for the Northern Rockies.

A female from Montana headed south through Wyoming, crossed southeastern Idaho, dropped down to Utah, crossed northern Colorado, and headed back up to Wyoming, where she ate poison and died.
