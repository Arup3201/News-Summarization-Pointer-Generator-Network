Dr Who, Top Gear and Teletubbies have apparently passed the suitability test to be shown on North Korea’s tightly-controlled state TV.

After months of negotiation with the BBC, the three shows have been deemed worthy of consideration for broadcasting in the totalitarian state.

The country’s state broadcaster, Korean Central Television, is only on air for six-and-a-half hours every day.

At least a third of the output is spent praising the government of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, while another third extols workers to toil harder for the good of the country.

The weekly television highlight is ‘It’s So Funny’, a long-running comedy show in which two uniformed soldiers perform slapstick sketches in between propaganda lectures about the greatness of North Korea.

The move to bring a little more light relief to the world’s most isolated country follows a BBC initiative last year, supported by the Foreign Office, to draw up a list of programmes the regime might consider importing.

At the time the Foreign Secretary William Hague hailed it as ‘a good way to improve understanding about the outside world within such a closed society’.

After long negotiations, the shortlist of three programmes was selected for consideration, with a report on each one sent to North Korea.

‘Extensive enquiries have been made about what these three shows involve and if they would be suitable for the Korean people,’ an insider in the capital Pyongyang told the Independent on Sunday.

‘Anything too political was not suitable but these are entertainment shows, and one of them is for young children.’

No timescale has been given for when an answer is expected, and the BBC said it would not comment until a final decision is made.

It is likely that Top Gear, at least, may have some of its dialogue edited and censored before being broadcast, but there should be no such problem with Teletubbies.
