Newcastle will be forced to use Daryl Janmaat as an emergency centre-back in their next three matches despite the Holland international admitting – ‘I’ve never played there in my life’.

The Magpies have left themselves desperately short of defensive cover and, with Steven Taylor and Paul Dummett sidelined because of injury until the summer and skipper Fabricio Coloccini suspended, only Mike Williamson remains as a recognised central defender.

Newcastle - who sold defenders Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa and Davide Santon in the January window -  failed in their bid to overturn Coloccini’s red card from Sunday’s 3-0 defeat at Everton.

The Argentine was dismissed following a lunge on Aaron Lennon and will now serve a three-game ban.

That rules him out of the Tyne-Wear derby at Sunderland on Easter Sunday, as well as testing fixtures with Arsenal and Liverpool.

It means right-back Janmaat is set to partner Williamson, but the 25-year-old said: ‘If the team needs me there, I am confident I can do well there, even though I have not played as a central defender in the whole of my career.

‘I will play in the middle of the defence if I am asked to do so, although it is not really my position.

‘It is not really as though I have ambitions to stay there, but we all know what the situation is at the moment and if I have to play there, I will.

‘The second half at Everton was the first time I have played there so it is not something I know all that well.’

The Dutch international has been one of Newcastle's most consistent performers so far this season
