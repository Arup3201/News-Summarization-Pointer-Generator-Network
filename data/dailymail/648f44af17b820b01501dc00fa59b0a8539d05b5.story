Good Morning America host Robin Roberts has reportedly signed a new long-term contract with ABC worth up to $14 million a year.

The mega deal, which Page Six reported to be between $13 million and $14 million, was kept hush hush by network reps, who still refuse to say whether or not one has even been signed.

'Over a month ago, they quietly 
inked a new, long-term, very high seven-figure deal with Robin that will
 keep [her] at the company for years to come,' a source told Page Six.

'It
 was a friendly negotiation. Robinâ€™s been [at ABC News] for over 20 
years... and will be a leader there for a very long time to come.'

They 
added that Roberts, 53, who took off six months from the show for a bone 
marrow transplant after being diagnosed with cancer, was grateful for 
the network's support when she was ill.

But she also made it clear that she wanted a 'fair deal' from execs, the source told the paper.

It added that a representative claimed that the deal was actually for below $10 million, but other sources refuted this.

Roberts' battle with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been a central story on the morning show, with cameras following her throughout her treatment.

She underwent several sessions of chemotherapy, and on September 20, 2012, she had a marrow transplant from her sister Sally-Ann, before returning to the show part-time in February.

After several setbacks and returns to the hospital, she went on vacation to Maui, Hawaii, with a group of friends in August for some time to recuperate.

This year, on the anniversary of the successful transplant, GMA threw her a one-year birthday party.

She also resumed her five-day-a-week schedule this past September.

Despite her turbulent past year, Roberts, who joined the network in 1995, has kept busy and announced in May that she will publishing a memoir, set to hit shelves in April 2014.

Revelations about her latest deal with the network comes at the same time that the show is also having to negotiate deals with other hosts of the show, Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer.

With the show taking the number one spot in the ratings, sources said the question is now whether the network is willing to commend the work of the other hosts with similarly high pay checks.

The other anchors are believed to have begun talks with ABC, although there had been reports that they were also looking at other networks.

George Stephanopoulos is believed to be signed to the network through 2014.

GMA has long held the top position among the morning show ratings. For the week of December 2, 5.874 million people turned in compared to the Today show's 5.213 million and CBS' 3.112 million.
