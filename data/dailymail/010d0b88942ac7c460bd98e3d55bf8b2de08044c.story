A businessman who was wrongly issued with a £15,000 phone bill by Vodafone only managed to get it cancelled by staging a three-hour sit-in at the firm's headquarters.

Edward Martin was sent the enormous invoice after the mobile phone company put him on a new tariff, but after eight hours on the phone he was unable to get them to admit their mistake.

Eventually, he was forced to go and camp outside the multinational firm's headquarters - and they were so desperate to make him go away that they caved in and cancelled the bill.

Mr Martin, 52, who runs a clothing business in Tiverton, Devon, said that his troubles started when he was put on a new package and told his bill would be recalculated.

Vodafone then sent him a series of inflated bills adding up to £14,949.41 - without explaining why he suddenly had to pay more.

'I have been a Vodafone customer for 21 years with no trouble,' he said. 'But in December they called me to say they had made a mistake and they would recalculate my bill.

'But they never called me back and never let me know in writing what my new tariff was. All they want is for me to pay up but I'm not going to because they have made a mistake, not me.

'I haven't used any more text or data than I did before I went into the Exeter store to get a new deal. I really don't understand what has changed.'

Proactive: Mr Martin had been unable to resolve the situation by phoning customer services

He repeatedly tried to phone the company to discuss the error, but was unable to rectify the situation.

'I must have spent eight hours on the phone to them being transferred to India, then Johannesburg, then onto Egypt and back to South Africa,' Mr Martin said.

'On one occasion I waited 27 minutes to speak with someone who told me they would call me back but they never did. That's just basic disregard for their customers.'

The businessman finally decided to take drastic action, and yesterday he drove two hours from his home to the firm's head office in Newbury, Berkshire.

Staff there initially said it would take three days to resolve the problem - but when Mr Martin refused to leave the premises, they dealt with his issue immediately.

He said: 'All seven car parks were full so I parked at the very front of the building, ignoring protestations from the security guys, and marched into reception.

'I was directed to the retail shop in the foyer - the shop staff were apparently highly trained in "problem resolution".

'The techie guy I spoke to made calls to various teams and one hour later appeared to tell me it would be sorted on Friday.

'I said this was unacceptable and I feared they were just giving me the run-around like they've been doing for the past four months.

'I thought nothing would be resolved by Friday so I told him I would wait there until then. He told me I could not do that so I sat firmly on a chair and told him to call security.

'He disappeared to the office and one hour later the headquarters store assistant manager appeared and told me that the whole bill would be cleared immediately.

'About 15 minutes later I was on my way with a letter confirming that my overcharge had been cleared and a copy of my correct contract.

'They have apologised and have launched an investigation, but they could have done a lot of damage to other people and businesses.'

A Vodafone spokesman said that an 'internal communication error' was to blame for Mr Martin's enormous bill, and confirmed it has now been wiped clean.
