Normally a source of annoyance, spilling a glass of wine or knocking over a paint tin usually means a couple of hours scrubbing the carpet.

But one photographer has transformed this negative into a positive by turning the act of spilling things into art.

Belgium-based photographer Manon Wethly filled up a series of containers with different liquids before tossing them in the air and capturing the effect on her camera.

In a spin: Belgium-based photographer Manon Wethly has captured images of different household objects flying through the air

Bottoms up: A knocked over glass of red wine would normally be greeted with a groan, but Manon Wethly has turned it into art

Mixing things up: A glass of black coffee spins through the air next to a cup of milk

Painting the sky red: A cup filled with red paint makes a splash as it is tossed into the air

The end result is a series of bright and bold images showing everything from wine glasses to coffee cups flying through the air.

Though Wethly experiments with different cameras and different backgrounds, the majority of her photos are taken with her iPhone against a clear blue or partly cloudy sky.

She will often try repeatedly throwing or spilling the same objects to see them fall or spin in different ways.

Speaking to Junk Culture, Wethly explains: 'It is absolutely fascinating to see what kind of shape an object or liquid gets when it is "flying". Clicking at exact the right second most often brings the most spectacular and surprising results.'

Lunch on the move: A cup of soup empties its contents - a rich tomato soup - as it descends to the earth

Bold and beautiful: The surreal images - mostly taken on an iPhone - make for startling artworks

Pass the milk: The dairy drinks almost looks like a cape flying off the back of the cup as it soars through the sky

Picturesque: Most of Wethly's flying object photos feature a clear blue or slightly cloudy sky as the back drop

Unique: Wethly says she like to experiment with different objects and contents to see what will happen
