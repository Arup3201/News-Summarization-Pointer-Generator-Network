Tragedy: Kyle Winterbottom, 16, was about to get off the parapet when he suddenly lost his footing and tumbled to the ground

A schoolboy has fallen 40 feet to his death from a third floor balcony trying to perform a daredevil stunt in front of his friends.

Kyle Winterbottom, 16, was about to climb off the parapet of the apartment block when he suddenly lost his footing and tumbled to the ground.

The teenager - a talented rugby player and swimmer - was taken to hospital but died later from multiple injuries.

The tragedy occurred at 2am on Saturday after Kyle had left a party to a go a friend's flat at an apartment block in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

He decided to sit on the parapet with his legs dangling over the edge but slipped as he tried to get back over.

Close friend Sean Dockerty,18, said: 'We’d all been at a party but it was dead so we decided to go back for a drink at my brother’s flat.

'We were having a good time and then Kyle went onto the balcony. It was about 2.20am on the Saturday morning. I heard screaming and people were shouting that he had fallen and I ran out and saw him.

'A friend ran down and put him in the recovery position and he was still alive at that point. He wouldn’t have jumped though. I don’t know exactly what happened.'

He added: 'I’ll just remember his cheeky smile, he was a really popular lad and it just shows with all the flowers which have been left here over the past three days. It’s such a shock, I still can’t get my head around it. '

Family friend John Flanagan, 51, said: 'I think he’d been dangling over the edge and hanging over and then when he’s tried to get back over he has lost his footing and fallen to the ground catching the fence underneath. It’s just been a tragic accident.

Accident: Kyle was described as a 'good lad and a joker'. He fell from this parapet at 2am on Saturday morning

'I just can’t believe it. Kyle’s parents are in a state and they can’t think straight.

'Kyle was a good lad, a joker and was proper good at sports. He showed a good ability from a young age particularly at rugby and he was always out and about.'

Kyle the third youngest of eight children to parents Joanne and Jimmy was set to received good GCSE grades from Hathershaw College in Oldham.

He took part in a triathlon event in Liverpool and played rugby for the youth team at Oldham St Annes Rugby Club.

Tributes: Leighton Brown, 19, Carlton Ellison, 18, Sean Dockerty, 18, and Lee Bailey, 16, with floral tributes to their friend at the scene where he fell

Kyle’s parents and their other children Leigh, 22, Jimmy, 21, Keelie, 19, Nicole 18, Kyle, 16, Jodie, 15, Jade, 13 and Ryan,11, were all being comforted.

Sister Nicole sad: 'He used to make everyone laugh. It’s not properly sunk in yet. He had everything going for him, I still can’t believe it, I only saw him a few days ago and he was his usual happy self.

'He was never down, even if he was he’d never show it. He’s like to go out with his mates and there were loads of them. He was really popular.

Happy family: Kyle (far left) when he was younger with his father Jimmy (centre) and other siblings

'He’d just finished secondary school and was looking forward to what was next. He was going to college to study sport. He was really good at rugby and loved football too.

'I think he would have liked a career in rugby. My mum and dad are in pieces, they are with him every day at the hospital.'

Another sister Leigh said: 'When we got the call it was 3am in the morning saying that Kyle had fallen. I felt sick to the stomach but I thought that he’d pull through. We went to the hospital and all his family was there.

Friends: Lee Bailey, 16, Sean Dockerty, 18, Leighton Brown, 19, and Carlton Ellison, 18 with tributes on Kyle's favourite jumper. Kyle was a talented sportsman and his teachers said he showed great promise

'He touched a lot of hearts and it’s not going to be the same without him.'

Lorna Philip, assistant headteacher at Hathershaw College, said: 'Kyle was one of a group of youngsters who showed great sporting promise.

'He was a cheeky chap and was always involved in sport. Our thoughts go out to Kyle’s family at this tragic time.'

The matter will be referred to the coroner. Greater Manchester Police said: 'Inquiries have been launched by officers, although there are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances.'
