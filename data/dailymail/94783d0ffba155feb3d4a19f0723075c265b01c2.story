A spectacular three-level property has been listed on the market for a cool $900,000 but it's no ordinary home.

Nestled at the end of a quiet street in Eltham, north-east of Melbourne’s CBD, the four-bedroom home comes complete with a 15-seat cinema, a room designed to resemble an aircraft's cockpit and seven separate living areas.

From a heated solar swimming pool with adjoining spa, outdoor dining and seating areas with palm trees and a plumbed in BBQ – it’s an entertainer’s wonderland that will make anyone feel like they’re on a permanent vacation.

Designed for the ultimate entertainer, families have the opportunity to impress their guests with a built in home theatre, billiard table in the gaming room, dance along a juke box or fly on a life sized flight simulator.

Home owner Bob Messenger told Daily Mail Australia the property would be a perfect fit to a family with teenagers who would prefer an ‘independent living’ and have a love for entertainment.

‘We’ve had 12 lots of families come in so far but unfortunately most of them have come through with young children,’ Mr Messenger said.

‘The home is listed at $900,000 but we’re looking for strong offers in that region and the home will sell perfectly to a family with teens.'

One of its unique features inside the sophisticated Ridgeview Street property is the life size flight simulator, which Mr Messenger built specifically for his son Daniel’s 21st birthday.

‘It was built for my son’s birthday and he has always loved flying,’ Mr Messenger said.

‘This is the next best thing because you don’t have to go out of the house to use it. It’s just a regular flight simulator that a lot of pilots use to train.

The bottom level features a spacious entertaining and red gaming room - complete with a billiard table, juke box and a life size robot

The property features up to three office or study rooms - perfect for peace and quiet 

The built-in cinema comes complete with a nine foot screen that seats 15 guests - perfect for a family movie night or entertainment

The property comes with four bedrooms on separate floors with three with en-suites, walk-in wardrobes and stunning bathrooms

‘It’s a computer tower and monitor and the controller is a joystick – instead of the joystick, we have the actual flying wheel so when you pull back – it lifts you up, as well as rudder pedals that turn the plane – it’s pretty realistic.

‘The cockpit is modelled on a Boeing 737 aircraft so we took pictures of it, cut them out, put plastic over the top and put holes and lights so it looks like radar screens – so it’s minimal work for maximum effect.’

Voted third in Australia's most liveable areas in 2009, the special features of the home has surprised many potential home buyers.

‘People have said they’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve seen the fathers looking but I don’t know if it [flight simulator] will sell the house unless there’s someone out there looking specifically for one – it’s a personal choice,' Mr Messenger said.

‘But I think what will sell the house in the entertainment areas.’

One of its unique features inside the sophisticated Ridgeview ST property is the life size flight simulator which took six months to build

The flight simulator was built for Daniel's 21st birthday by his father Bob and some friends, which took six month in the making

One of the special features of the home is the 'Hobby room' - but it could be converted to a wine cellar or a workshop

The idea came to light after Mr Messenger thought one of the rooms on the lower level was big enough to fit three monitors and a number of seats.

‘I built it with my son and his friends. One of them is a bit of a whiz with IT,’ he said.

After six months in the making, the flight simulator now features two jump seats which seats up to four people, one flying seat and one co-pilot seat.

‘You can exit out on one side and it looks like you’re stepping out onto the side of the plain at a control gate when you reverse it,’ Mr Messenger said.

Up for sale by Agent in a Box, the newly renovated home comes complete with three spacious levels with each floor delivering its own ‘resort style living’ – perfect for the whole family.

Built in 1991, Mr Messenger and his family moved into the property in August 2002 while the home has been fully repainted inside and undergone a major overhaul, partially re-floored and re-carpeted, with many features added on over the last 13 years.

‘Each level has an ensuite and its own living areas – an area on every floor where everyone can go for peace and quiet,’ Mr Messenger said.

The owners are reluctantly downsizing as the children steadily move out of home. 

'We decided to sell the home because we want to move out to an area that's more of a country side with views of mountains - that's what our dream is,' Mr Messenger said.
