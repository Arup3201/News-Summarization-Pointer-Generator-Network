Authorities in Washington D.C. are investigating a crash involving one of their own boats after a police vessel smashed into two parked boats before speeding off, leaving one to sink.

D.C. Harbor Police were sounding their sirens as they crashed into the boats which were docked at Washington Harbor in Georgetown on Saturday night.

The entire incident was caught on video by a passerby. Some witnesses said it appeared as if the driver of the boat purposefully took a wide turn to show off, WUSA9 reported.

No one was on the boats when the crash occurred and there were no injuries.

Impact: The boat hits the parked boat before turning sharply and fleeing the scene

Heading off: The boat then speeds off, but passersby said officers returned to check on the damage

One of the boats was left with a 
massive hole along its side, causing it to partially sink. Crews spent 
hours on Sunday dragging it from beneath the surface and taking it to the dock.

Shawn Kuykendall
had borrowed the boat from a friend for a day out and was at a nearby 
restaurant when the police officers slammed into the parked vessel, he told WUSA9.

'Someone
came and said, "A boat's been hit, this is crazy",' he said. 'We went 
to check it out thinking, "Let's hope it's not my boat" and we saw 100 people crowded around 
where our boat was.

'The boat was on its side, hanging, its whole left 
side submerged, and the boat's gone and done.'

He added: 'No pun intended, but immediately my heart sank.'

Damage: One of the parked boats suffered a massive gash to its side and began to sink at the dock

Witnesses say Harbor Police were 
traveling so quickly because they were responding to a distress call from people in the water and simply lost control of the boat.

Kuykendall said people told him they 'did a Baywatch move... seemingly for show'.

He
said he had dreaded calling his friend to say the boat was sinking, but the
owner, Sheri Saunders, told WUSA9: 'It's not his fault. We're glad he 
wasn't on it.'

The man who captured the video, Ajay Jafaar, said he could not believe he was recording the boats at exactly the moment they were hit. He credited the police officers for their job afterwards.

'Honestly the cops later did a great job by fixing everything and consequences 
were held,' he wrote on his YouTube page. 'The cop that hit the boats stayedï»¿ the entire time.'

Police have said they are investigating what led to the accident.

The U.S. Coast Guard is also investigating the crash.
