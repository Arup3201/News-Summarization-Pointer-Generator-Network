This is the moment a group of adrenaline junkies flew down the world's largest urban zipline - stretching a staggering 2,000 feet across a city. 

The daredevils were filmed grabbing on to two pull ropes attached to the 800-foot White Tower skyscraper in Panama City, Panama.

They then launched themselves down the zipline, before letting go and descending into terrifying parachute jumps.

In good spirits: The daredevils were filmed grabbing on to two pull ropes on a skyscraper in Panama City. They then launched themselves down the zipline, before letting go and descending into parachute jumps

Massive: The zipline stretched from the 800-foot White Tower skyscraper to the other side of the marina

The zipline, stretching from the skyscraper to the other side of the marina, takes just seven seconds to hit the ground, so the jumpers had to pull their parachutes four seconds into their decline.

The incredible footage was filmed on a range of stunt cameras, which were placed on the ground and attached to various buildings, as well as a helicam.

The idea came from 31-year-old extreme cinematographer Devin Graham - or 'DevinSuperTramp' -  who has become widely known on social media sites.

The sports stuntman boasts a whopping 2.3 million YouTube subscribers and has generated more than 390 million views on his site.

Speaking of his latest feat, Mr Graham said: 'Ever since I was a little kid, I was borrowing my parents' cameras to get the shot that no one else could.'

In the footage, the adrenaline junkies can be seen taking turns to fly down the zipline, before flipping through the air with cheers and screams.

They are then filmed pulling their parachute cords and landing on a large blue circle on the ground.
