China has successfully launched its most ambitious space mission yet, sending the country's first female astronaut into space alongside two male colleagues.

Female astronaut Liu Yang, 33, is set to become a national hero to a billion people after the successful blast-off on Saturday.

The mother of one is on the Shenzhou 9 capsule which lifted off at 10.30am from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch 
Centre on the edge of the Gobi Desert.

It being sent into orbit on a Long March rocket fired to the Tiangong-1 'Heavenly Palace' space station.

Shorty after lift off all the space capsules systems were found to be working normally and just over 10 minutes later it opened its solar panels and entered orbit around earth.

Ms Yang, a military pilot, is with Jing Haipeng and Liu Wang and the trio will dock with a prototype space lab launched last year.

Orbit: The astronauts disappear into the sky and are now well on their way to the Tiangong 1 space station which they are expected to reach on Monday

The will work on the space station for about a week in what the Chinese hope will be a key step toward building a permanent space station.

Chang Wanquan, a People's Liberation Army general and the space programme chief, declared the launch a success.

Two of the astronauts will live and work
inside the module to test its life-support systems while the third will
remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies.

China hopes to join the U.S. and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained
space stations into orbit.

Anticipation: Crowds of proud Chinese people gathered to watch the country's first female astronaut successfully lift off and journey into space from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre

It is already one of just three nations to 
have launched manned spacecraft on their own. China first launched a man into space in a 2003 solo mission.

This was followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008.

Another manned mission to the module is 
planned later this year, while possible future missions could include 
sending a man to the moon.

The space program is a source of enormous national pride for China and is seen as reflecting its economic and technological progress.

Command: Chinese aerospace scientists and engineers at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre which lead with Shenzhou 9's space mission

The successful of sending the country's first female astronaut into space is giving the program a big publicity boost.

Ms Yang, who is described as a brilliant 
student with an impeccable service record, has also been selected 
because of her 'excellent flight skills and psychological quality', according to
the Xinhua news agency.

She
has been praised for her cool handling of an incident when her jet hit a
flock of pigeons, but she was still able to land the heavily damaged 
aircraft.

Ms Yang and her fellow astronauts are expected to reach the Tiangong 1 space station on Monday and is now orbiting at 213 miles above Earth.

China hopes a bigger permanent space station due can be in place by about 2020 and will weigh about 60 tons.

In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou 8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong 1 by remote control.
