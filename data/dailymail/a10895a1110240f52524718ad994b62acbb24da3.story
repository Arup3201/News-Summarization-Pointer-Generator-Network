England striker Wayne Rooney is the latest World Cup star to feature in a teaser for Nike's new animated advert.

Cartoon versions of Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Neymar showing off their super skills have been released during the past few days.

Catch of the day: A cartoon version of Wayne Rooney stars as a fisherman in latest Nike advert

And now Rooney has taken centre stage in a nine second clip by appearing as a browbeaten fisherman who gets caught in a net.

No doubt all will be explained when the full version of the mini movie is released on Monday, June 9 but some wags may suggest he is fishing for a new career.

Former Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes sparked a debate when he described him as a fading force who faces being dropped by England boss Roy Hodgson.

Caught out: Rooney finds himself in the net in the animated advert

Rooney, who missed the end of the Barclays Premier League season with a groin problem, is the only outfield player to start both of England’s warm-up games. He scored their opener in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in Miami, his first international goal since October.

‘I can play in different  positions,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve proved I can play on the left over the years. The manager didn’t have to tell me what to do. I know how to play that role. I’ve played it many times and I’ve no problem doing that. He didn’t have to explain it to me.

All at sea: Is under-fire England striker fishing for a new career?

‘It is down to the manager. It’s not about me, it’s about the team. If the manager wants to play me up top, in behind, left, right, I’m happy to do that.

‘I’m ready to play. I hope to play against Honduras. I’ve trained hard, I have no injuries or any recurrence of the groin strain I had at the end of the season.

‘I always needed game time. I felt really good, especially in the heat. I’m sure the manager will have a tough decision but I’m ready.’
