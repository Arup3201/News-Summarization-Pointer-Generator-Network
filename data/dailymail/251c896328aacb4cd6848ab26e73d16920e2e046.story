A Victoria Cross awarded to a war hero who was so badly wounded that his wife was wrongly told he was dead has sold for an impressive £192,000 - but the tale of valour behind the medal is priceless.

Sergeant William Traynor was awarded the VC in 1901 for jumping from his trench into heavy enemy fire in order to dash across a battlefield to help a wounded man.

He was shot in the leg and chest but still dragged the casualty to safety with the help of another comrade.

His own injuries appeared so bad that military officials sent a telegram home to his wife saying he had been killed.

She later learned that he had 
survived and he went on to recover from his wounds suffered in the Boer 
War at Bothwell Camp, South Africa.

The grandson of Sergeant William Traynor 
decided to sell the prestigious medal in order to split the proceeds 
between his own children.

It was bought by a British private collector for £160,000. With all the fees added on the overall price paid for it was £192,000.

Christopher Hill, from auctioneers 
Dix Noonan and Webb, said: ‘One of the great-grandchildren was at the 
sale and was quite emotional.

‘The seller found himself in the 
position of being unable to leave the medal to any one child and so 
decided the best thing would be to let it go to a good home and let all 
four children benefit from it.

‘We were very happy with the price the medal achieves, it was well above the pre-sale estimate.’

He added: ‘As is oft forgotten, the Victoria Cross is as much issued for saving life as it is for taking it.

‘And the gallantry displayed by William Traynor at Bothwell was a classic example of the former.

Respect: He couldn't collect his Victoria Cross from King Edward VII, but Sergeant William Traynor had the chance to meet Winston Churchill - who also fought in the Boer conflict - at Sevenoaks in 1945

‘He rescued a wounded comrade under a murderous fire at night, himself taking hits in the chest and a thigh.

‘Indeed such was the serious nature 
of his resultant wounds that his wife Jane received an erroneous War 
Office telegram reporting that he had been killed in action.

‘His case has all the drama one might expect of a VC action.’

Some 2,000 enemy Boer soldiers attacked the British camp at Bothwell at 3am on February 6, 1901.
They let loose horses run through the camp in order to disorientate the 
British and make them think they were being attacked by the cavalry.

Many
were killed in their beds before they had even dressed to respond to 
the attack. Twenty-four officers were killed and 53 were badly wounded.

Sgt
Traynor's valiant actions were true to Arthur Conan Doyle's description
of the regiment in his history of the Boer war - 'The West Yorkshires 
were no more flurried at three in the morning than at three in the 
afternoon.'

But the 
injuries he suffered in the daring rescue were so extensive that 
military doctors expected him to die.

Although Sgt Traynor went on to recover and reunite with his 
wife, his injuries 
led to him being discharged from the army. 

He was also unable to travel to 
Buckingham Palace to receive his VC from King Edward VII. He was 
invested with it at York by Colonel Edward Browne, also a VC winner from
the Boer War.

Sgt Traynor later moved to Dover, 
Kent, where he was given the post of barrack warden and was mentioned 
for valuable service during the the First World War.

He retired in 1935 but remained active in the Royal British Legion until his death in 1953 aged 83.

VCs rarely come onto the market and when they do are often snapped by Lord Ashcroft, the Conservative peer.

His collection that is worth five 
million pounds and includes one tenth of all the 1,351 VCs awarded since
1856 has been donated to the Imperial War Museum.

It is not known whether he bought this latest one.
