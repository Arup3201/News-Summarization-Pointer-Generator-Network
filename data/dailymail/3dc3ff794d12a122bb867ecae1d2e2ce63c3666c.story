It is a time for growth and rejuvenation, a state of semi-consciousness where we dream, imagine and put demons to rest. We spend a third of our lives asleep yet remember very little about it.

One photographer, fascinated by our nocturnal behaviour, made it his life's work to capture the way we slumber through a time-lapse photo series.

Ted Spagna from New York passed away in 1989 at the age of 45. He took photographs of children, couples, singletons and groups moving, stretching and cuddling in bed.

His beautiful work is now released in a new book entitled Sleep, featuring all the 70 chronological grids of his various subjects.

The intriguing coffee table book is a voyeuristic journey through Spagna's human sleep portraiture work.

Spagna was an influential teacher, filmmaker, and photographer who discovered and pioneered the art of sleep portraiture.

From 1975­ to 1989 his sleeping subjects included people ranging in age from newborns to 92-year-olds and a wide variety of animals in captivity. His 
voyeuristic venture into 'inner space' exposes the secrets of human 
sleep behaviour using time-lapse camera.

'I was surprised to see another self that existed in 
sleep that I didn’t know about,' he told the New York Times.

From the erotic to the domestic, 
men and women alone to tender intertwined couples, all are psychologically - often literally - naked.

Presented in brilliantly coloured exposures, these sensual, 
cinematic images of dressed or undressed sleeping subjects depict the unique nature of our natural behaviour.

The significance in his work lies in 
both its aesthetic and scientific implications. Until Spagna came along,
sleep researchers never had this kind of visual information about their subjects.

Taken at fixed intervals throughout 
the night using a bird's-eye view, and displayed in chronological order,
the series of images look almost like a silent film.

The book includes editorial contributions from 
the renowned photographer Mary Ellen Mark, as well as Dr Allan Hobson, notable
psychiatrist and dream researcher.

'It's fabulous that Sleep has
been published. You don't see a lot of great work anymore and Spagna's 
work is fantastic! It deserves to be seen and I'm thrilled that his work
has new life. Many have been inspired by this work and, thanks to these 
projects, many more will be,' says Mary Ellen Mark.

'Ted
Spagna's photographs have done more than any other medium to make sleep
science visible, and hence, directly understandable to the general 
public,' says Dr Hobson.
