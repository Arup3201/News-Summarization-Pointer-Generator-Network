Beijing’s Bird’s Nest Stadium is gearing up for the first Superclásico de las Americas to be held outside of Argentina or Brazil on Saturday and interest from Chinese fans is massive ahead of the historic tie.

Fans mobbed Lionel Messi and his Argentina team mates  as they arrived into Beijing International airport and China’s Yangtze Evening News reported an accident was prevented following one fan’s decision to switch escalator’s to get close to the players.

Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency has also revealed that the Argentina squad skipped a trip to Beijing’s famous Forbidden City due to security worries.

This isn’t the first time China has experienced enthusiastic crowds, the visit of David Beckham caused a stampede at Shanghai’s Tongji University last year injuring 5 people.

The Brazil squad was also greeted by huge crowds as they arrived into Beijing but surprisingly it’s not Neymar the Chinese fans were most excited for but his more experienced team mate Kaka. 

The 32 year old with three World Cup appearances to his name returns to the Brazil set up following an 18 month exile.

Despite the looming shadow of 22-year-old Barcelona star Neymar, Kaka is held in high regard by Chinese fans. Brazil coach Dunga called up Kaka to replace injured Cruzeiro midfielder Ricardo Goular; he signed autographs and posed for pictures on his arrival into the airport and at his hotel.

Hundreds of fans greeted Messi's arrival, and many more were reported to be at the players' hotel

Ifeng, the official Chinese website of the Superclásico, polled fans on their favorite players from the two squads with Argentina’s Lionel Messi the clear winner on over 212,000 votes. 

In second place though is Brazilian Kaka with 76,000 votes way ahead of compatriot Neymar on 24,000 in third place.

AC Milan and Beijing Baxy fan Jincheng Xu explained to Sportsmail the fascination with the recalled Brazil star. 

‘Kaka has good qualities and a good personality as a man, there is never any negative news about him. He is the perfect professional football player in our eyes.’

‘Both Kaka and Neymar are talented players but Kaka is more humble and experienced than Neymar and that is what is important to Chinese fans, having that kind of role model’ said Xu.

Kaka loses out in the Chinese social media stakes though where he has only 0.71 million followers on social networking site Tencent Weibo in comparison to Messi with nearly 20 million on rival site Sina Weibo.

Saturday’s game is a friendly but that’s hardly the appropriate word for this rivalry. Since 1914 there have been 95 meetings between the two nations with results almost even, Argentina on 36 victories, Brazil with 35 and 24 matches finishing in a draw.

In terms of Chinese public opinion on Saturday’s result, things are not as close. Chinese website Sohu is reporting 74.3 per cent of fans in a 14,000 strong online discussion are going for Argentina in the clash which has been the focus of heavy advertising in recent weeks.

Not just the first on foreign soil, Saturday is also the first Superclásico de las Américas to allow call up’s from foreign countries. Argentina have taken full advantage of this with just three of their 24 man squad based at home while Brazil bring nine.

Dunga replaced Chelsea’s Ramires with uncapped Sao Paulo midfielder Souza while Botafogo goalkeeper Marcelo Grohe was also added late due to a finger injury to Jefferson. 

Following the clash Brazil will face Japan in Singapore on the October 14 while Argentina face Hong Kong the same day.

While games like this are not often treated seriously abroad, Chinese fans are not lacking in commitment as the game approaches.

Student Fan Xiao of Shandong University traveled 460km from Jinan to Beijing not just for the game itself but for glimpses of her idols. ‘I am a big Brazil fan, I don’t want to miss this opportunity to see them,’ says Xiao.

‘In the last three days I went to the airport three times and saw the team train every day. I got the autographs of five players including my hero Mario Fernandes. This will be one of the best memories of my life.’

Despite the excitement over their arrival and anticipation of the game, something far beyond Chinese fans' control may have a big effect on the game - pollution. 

The Brazilian team trained on Friday but are spending as much time as possible in their hotel before the game

Beijing has had a tough few years with the issue and since Wednesday, levels have been labeled ‘Hazardous’ with masks recommended, hardly ideal for a professional football match.

Conditions have apparently kept Brazil inside their hotel, aside from a brief training session, but despite the threat Chinese fans remain upbeat. 

Chinese social media users have suggested that Lionel Messi should wear a mask when he plays so they still get to see the Argentine turn out; fingers are crossed for the pollution to clear for Saturday’s clash.
