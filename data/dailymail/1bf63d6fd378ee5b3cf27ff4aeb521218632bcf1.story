Perhaps not surprisingly considering his name, Burnley striker Lukas Jutkiewicz has been mistaken for a foreigner on occasion.

‘When people meet me, they seem to speak a little bit slower and then they realise I’m as English as they come,’ says Southampton-born Jutkiewicz, who has never set foot in Poland despite his heritage.

Then there’s team-mate Ashley Barnes, whose qualification for his Austria Under 20 cap starts and ends with his paternal grandmother having been born there.

In fact, take away reserve goalkeeper Alex Cisak — Polish-born and Australian-bred — and there isn’t a single foreigner on the books at Turf Moor.

In the last three games, Burnley have become the first Premier League club since Blackpool in 2011 to field a starting XI made up entirely of players born in Britain. Until now, Belfast-born defender Michael Duff and Republic of Ireland international Stephen Ward were the only exceptions.

That will be music to the ears of FA chairman Greg Dyke who has made it his mission to increase the number of home-grown players in a league that has thrived from attracting some of the top talent in world football.

The feeling around Burnley is that it might even be the key to Sean Dyche’s team surviving in the top flight this season.

‘We love it,’ said midfielder George Boyd. ‘You get that grit from the British players, they all want to work hard. It’s a big factor for us as a club, we all put a shift in.

‘It’s that working-class attitude. It’s instilled in you, especially being from Britain, that you need to work hard to get anything in life. We’re highest on the work-rate stats and distance covered, and that’s something we pride ourselves on . . . you don’t always need to go foreign to do well in the Premier League.’

Burnley’s track record of signing foreign players down the years is patchy at best. For every Brian Jensen, Christian Kalvenes or Joey Gudjonsson, there are more than a few who didn’t work out.

Supporters still wince at the mere mention of Frederic Nimani, Besart Berisha and Fernando Guerrero.

Marco Gentile, the nephew of Italy’s World Cup winner Claudio, also disappeared after his only game in 1997.

Dane Richards, Burnley’s last foreigner who was signed by Eddie Howe in 2012, made his league debut under Dyche as a substitute against Huddersfield and was then substituted himself 45 minutes later. The Jamaica international did not play for the club again.

Despite Burnley’s reliance on British-born players, Dyche insists there is no club policy against buying foreigners.

He argues that the lack of a European scouting network has made it difficult for Burnley to compete with the bigger clubs, although that could change after former Manchester United and Everton scout Robbie Cooke was appointed last month to oversee the international operation.

‘There’s a lot made about it but, as a manager, you’re not really bothered where players come from,’ said Dyche. ‘You see beyond all the cultures, colours, and creeds. You want good footballers and I’m no different.

‘Plenty of teams are doing well without a core of British players, and if players become available who are not from these shores then we’ll certainly look at that.’

He added: ‘There are a lot of fans out there who like our journey. Loads of people say, “We think it’s great and we want you to stay up”. There’s a story beyond the story, which is a smaller club developing players without major resources, British or not. The thing is, they like the story.’
