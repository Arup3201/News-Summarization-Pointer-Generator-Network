Police are searching for four teens from Iowa, two girls and two boys, who have been missing since Saturday and are believed to be runaways.

The girls, Skie Floyd and Jazlyn Visek, both 15, were last seen around noon Saturday at a park in Shellsburg, Iowa.

Police believe the girls are with two teen runaways, 13-year-old Austin Michael Boggs and 16-year-old Corey Sunderman from Atlantic, Iowa, which is roughly 200 miles from Shellsburg.

The four teens are believed to be traveling in a 1997 gold Jeep Grand Cherokee with no license plates. 

'At
 this point we're 99.99% certain what we have here is a runaway, not an 
abduction,' Benton County Sheriff Randy Forsyth said.

Authorities
 believe the teenagers are together because one of the boys borrowed a 
man's phone in Norway, Iowa around 10 am on Saturday to call one of the 
girls.

Skie's mother Dusty Hiepler-Floyd told KCRG: 'I know my daughter is scared right now, I'm sure she wants to come home.'

Floyd,
 who is 5ft 1ins, was last seen wearing a black hooded sweatshirt with 
white pin stripes, dark jeans and black boots. She weighs roughly 115 
pounds and has blonde hair.
