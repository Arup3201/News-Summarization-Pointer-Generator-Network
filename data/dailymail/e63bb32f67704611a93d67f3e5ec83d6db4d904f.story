Caught: Mohammed Ahmed, 21, pictured, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute last week while he was honeymooning with his new wife in Florida

The honeymoon is over for Mohammed Ahmed.

The 21-year-old Illinois man was arrested for soliciting a prostitute last week while he was honeymooning with his new wife in Florida.

Ahmed was among 92 people nabbed in a prostitution sweep conducted by Polk County Sheriff's Office.

The alleged john answered an online ad, on website Backpage.com, which, to his horror, turned out to be planted by an undercover deputy as part of the four-day operation.

Ahmed left his newlywed in their room at the Omni Hotel in Champions Gate when he went off on his sojourn to pay for sex.

When he never returned, the worried bride called the sheriff's office to report him missing.

She was quickly told he was in fine health - but wouldn't be resuming the vacation because he was in a jail cell having been booked on charges of soliciting prostitution.

The catch of a husband was also charged with possession of marijuana.

During the four-day sting, police caught 12 pimps, 39 alleged prostitutes and 39 suspected johns.

One
 of the worst of the batch was 45-year-old youth minister Samuel Yoon 
from California who came to the undercover location believing he was 
going to have sex with a 14-year-old girl.

'Prostitution is illegal, and those who commit or who derive proceeds from this crime in Polk County can expect to go to jail,' Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement.Â 

'The nexus between prostitution and other crime, such as illegal drugs, violence against women, and human trafficking is a real problem.'

He said whether it is on the street or online, prostitution is illegal and his office would continue to investigate and arrest those involved.
