Broken-hearted Britons love nothing more than a much-needed holiday after a love split, according to new statistics.

One-fifth of those questioned in a new poll said they organised a trip within three months of a break-up, with the majority saying they needed to 'take their mind off the split'.

But an optimistic one-quarter said they booked a holiday with the idea of finding a new love interest.

All by myself: A fifth of newly-single Britons said they book a holiday within three months of a split

Party time: Back in 2009, Katie Price headed to Ibiza to get over her split from Peter Andre

Ibiza topped the list of holiday destinations chosen by newly-single Britons, according to the poll by sunshine.co.uk.

The White Isle is where Katie Price chose to forget all her worries after splitting from former husband Peter Andre.

The Greek island of Rhodes was the second favourite destination for broken-hearted holidaymakers, followed by Ibiza's neighbour Mallorca.

Cyprus and mainland Spain made up the top five destinations for newly-single Britons.

Fresh start: While the majority of heartbroken Britons book a trip to get away from it all, a quarter admitted they hoped to meet a new partner

While taking their mind off the break-up and meeting a new partner were the most popular reasons for travel, a further 13 per cent said their friends convinced them to treat themselves to a break.

And 17 per cent said they were already due a holiday.

Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: 'It was interesting to see all of the typical party destinations in the top five list of heartbreak holiday locations, with resorts such as San Antonio, Faliraki, Magaluf, Ayia Napa and Marbella probably the hardest hit by heartbroken holidaymakers.â€™

'Getting a bunch of friends together for a few days in the sun or even going away with family can be a good way to get some distance from everything and return home to the UK with a clearer head... and maybe a new partner!'
