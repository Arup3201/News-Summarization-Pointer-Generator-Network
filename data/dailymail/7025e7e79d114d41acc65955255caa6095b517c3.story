Rory McIlroy admitted he cut his Open party short in order to immediately focus on adding to his major haul and completing the career grand slam at the Masters next spring.

The 25-year-old Northern Irishman became the third youngest player - after Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus - to win three majors and celebrated his glorious triumph at Hoylake in a Liverpool nightclub, followed by a champagne-fuelled session in Belfast with old friends the following evening.

But with the US PGA Championship held at Valhalla in just the second week of August, the last thing McIlroy wants is a hangover and by Wednesday he was already enduring an intense fitness session at the GSK Human Performance Lab in London.

McIlroy is in no mood to let major tournaments slip by while he is in the form of his life, and his sights are already set on both the year's final major and then the big one at Augusta next April, where he can become only the sixth player in history to complete the full set.

'That’s an immense thing to aim for and I still can’t believe I’ll be going in at 25 with a chance,' McIlroy, who turns 26 next May, told The Telegraph. 'For me it’ll always be all about the majors. In the Tiger era, their importance has become massive. They’re the storyline, they’re the narrative: "How many majors have you won?" not "How many tournaments have you won?".

Despite his already burgeoning major haul, McIlroy has had a mercurial and at times turbulent career, but since breaking off his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in May he has won both the prestigious BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and now The Open. The former US Open and US PGA champion intends to strike while his irons are hot.

'I’m 25, and realistically I have 15 more years at the top of my game - that’s 60 chances or so,' he said. 'And since the 2011 US Open, I’ve won three in 14 majors. As everybody knows I’ve had some up and downs in that time, but I would have taken that return. Jeez, would I? That’s nearly one a year – and I can add up, you know.'

Pictures have emerged from last Sunday night in Liverpool that suggest a wild party - friends and family were shown filling the Claret Jug with Jagermeister - but McIlroy admitted clubbing with his parents was 'a bit surreal and weird.'

Monday's bash was a wilder one, with many bottles of champagne filling the famous old trophy as it was passed round a big table of friends to swill from. McIlroy admits that was the night he truly 'let my hair down.'

But McIlroy insists the party is over for now while he chases sporting immortality. Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Nicklaus and Woods have achieved the grand slam, but McIlroy is already three quarters of the way there.

'I’ve turned a corner in everything,' he said. 'I’m on a good path; the game’s good, mentally I’m good and I’ve never been so fit and healthy. So I’ll enjoy it but will keep going, foot down... there’ll be plenty of time to party.'
