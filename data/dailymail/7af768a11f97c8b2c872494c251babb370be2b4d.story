Boxer Amir Khan visited his beloved Bolton’s training ground posing for a picture with Wanderers manager Neil Lennon, wishing the club luck for the rest of the season.

The 28-year-old beat Devon Alexander over 12 rounds in Las Vegas in December to retain the WBC Silver Welterweight title and hopes he can negotiate a glamour bout with Floyd Mayweather.

Khan will be pleased with Lennon’s work since taking over at the Macron Stadium, having led Bolton to 15th in the Championship from bottom of the table and into the FA Cup fourth round to take on Liverpool. 

Amir Khan took time out to visit Bolton's training ground on Tuesday and had a picture with Neil Lennon

The boxer posted a picture on his Twitter account posing next to Lennon with the caption ‘Just had lunch with Tony Kelly and Neil Lennon at @OfficialBWCT @OfficialBWFC good luck for rest of the season’.

Last month Khan visited the school in north western Pakistan where Taliban militants massacred 132 children.

The welterweight boxer, who was born in Britain but is of Pakistani origin, donated the £30,000 shorts he wore against Devon Alexander in order to help raise money to repair the Army School in Peshawar.
