A leading dance star who walked out of the Royal Ballet last year has vanished again just days before his new show is set for its UK premiere.

Sergei Polunin, 23, was due to star in Midnight Express but failed to turn up to rehearsals on Wednesday and has not been seen since.

The show, directed by Peter Schaufuss, is due to open next Tuesday at London's coliseum.

Vanished: Sergei Polunin was the youngest ever male principal dancer at Britain's Royal Ballet but caused a storm when he walked out

After the Ukrainian dancer failed to show up his hotel room was searched but he had vanished.

Polunin became the youngest-ever male 
principal dancer at Britain's Royal Ballet when he was 19, but walked 
out of the company last year, saying he was giving up dance.

He later said he had quit because he could no longer handle the stress of a dance career.

The star also told reporters that he found rehearsing 'very boring' and 
wanted to give up ballet by the age of 26 as it was so gruelling.

It is not known whether he has walked out again or if he has been involved in some kind of accident.

There were claims that Polunin had chosen to quit Midnight Express because he did not like the production.

Schaufuss told the BBC he was 'hugely disappointed' the young star had left.

'Artists have good and bad days - that goes with the territory - but rehearsals were going well,' he said.

The dance company said Polunin's mentor, Igor Zelensky, had also left the production.

Polunin, who moved to Britain aged 13, had spoken in a 2011 interview about the pressure he felt to succeed.

'I would have liked to behave badly, to play football. I loved sport,' he told The Guardian. 'But all my family were working for me to succeed. There was no chance of me failing.'

Polunin later returned to performing under Zelensky at Moscow's Stanislavsky Ballet and has made guest appearances with the Royal Ballet.

When his role in Midnight Express was announced late last year, Polunin said it was 'exactly the kind of work I want to be making, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.'

The Peter Schaufuss ballet company said understudy Johan Christensen would take over the main role in the show.

Midnight Express is based on the 1977 memoir by Billy Hayes about being jailed in Turkey for drug smuggling.

The book was also made into a film which won a Best Writing Academy Award for Oliver Stone.

A spokeswoman for the show was unable to give any further details about Polunin's departure.
