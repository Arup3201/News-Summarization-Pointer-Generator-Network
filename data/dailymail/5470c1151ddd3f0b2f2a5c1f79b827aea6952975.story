Dressed to impress: Albert Smith, who was charged with embezzlement, photographed dressed as a knight in armour in the odd shot

Dressed in a suit of armour, Frank Albert Smith looks to be a man of integrity and honour.

But do not be deceived - as he was actually a known criminal operating in the late 1800s.

In 1894 the offender was charged with embezzlement and his bizarre police photograph shows him dressed as a knight in armour.

It remains a mystery as to why he is dressed in such attire.

The image is one of many compiled by Bath police between 1892 and 1922 to help them identify criminals and repeat offenders in the city.

As well as their rogues' gallery images other details were noted - such as offenders' age, physical appearance and of course their crimes.

Fraudsters and tricksters brought to book by police at the time were also convicted and their mug shots added to police files.

Many smartly dressed criminals were convicted of 'false pretences' - with their apparent respectability helping them lure their prey.

Fraudsters included Alfred Mitchell, a mining engineer and Cyril Dudley Vincent, a music-hall artist.

Samuel Zucker, who used the aliases of Edward Von Dalwick and Baron Jules Mercy was also charged.

One police file said that in 1911: 'Oliver Love:
medium build, dark brown hair and moustache, successively convicted of 
stealing ducks & fowl; a pair of boots; an overcoat; a fowl (again);
and finally an umbrella' was sentenced to several months' hard labour 
in prison.

The portraits of Bath's criminal history have been put online by Bath & North East Somerset Council's Record Office.

Principal archivist Colin Johnston said: 'People researching their family history are very excited by criminal ancestors.

'They would far rather find a 'black sheep' than aristocracy or royalty.

'We hope this new online resource on our website will be a big hit with anyone looking at family or social history in Bath.'
