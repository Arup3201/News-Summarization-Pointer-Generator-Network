President Barack Obama appears to shrug-off his well-publicized spat with Hillary Clinton - joining the former Secretary of State on the dance floor to boogie the night away at a friend's birthday party.

The President was photographed getting his groove on at the Martha's Vineyard party on Wednesday night following a dinner where he sat next to Mrs Clinton days after she criticized his foreign policy.

In an interview last weekend, Clinton described U.S. policy in Syria as a failure and said Obama's doctrine of "'don't do stupid stuff" is not an organising principle' for a great nation.

Good times: Hillary Clinton joins President Obama on the dance floor during the Birthday party of Vernon Jordan's wife at Martha's Vineyard

Reporters were not allowed into the private dinner celebrationÂ at the Farm Neck Golf Club, but White House spokesman Eric Schultz said afterward: 'The Obamas danced nearly every song. A 
good time was had by all.'

Obama, Clinton and their spouses sat at the same 
table and the Obamas were 'happy to have the chance to spend time with 
Secretary Clinton and former President Clinton.'

Approximately 150 
people were at the celebration where both Obama and Clinton delivered 80th birthday toasts to guest of honor 
Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan.

Mr Jordan, a civil rights leader and staunch Obama supporter, is a close friend of Bill Clinton who he served as a senior adviser.

In 2006, Jordan served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, making recommendations on the U.S. policy in Iraq.A photo of the president dancing was posted to Instagram by a fellow party goer, however it has now been deleted. Reports he and Mrs Clinton hugged are yet to be confirmed.

French
 Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius took a shot at Obama on Tuesday for 
continuing on with his two-week vacation while Iraq burned.

'I
 know it is the holiday period in our Western countries,' Fabius said, 'but when people are dying, you 
must come back from vacation.'

Still got it: Bill Clinton struts his stuff on the dance floor during the birthday celebrations. A White House spokesman said: 'A good time was had by all'

This photo of President Barack Obama partying the night away was posted to Instagram by fellow party guest Liz Cecil. It was quickly deleted this morning after news outlets began sharing it

As
 the president enjoyed a meal of surf and turf and pasta as 
it was revealed that U.S. and British troops were about to be deployed 
to a mountain in northern Iraq to save refugees who had been stranded 
there for more than a week.

Approximately 5,000 Iraqis were still thought to be stuck on Sinjar Mountain as of 
yesterday evening, prompting the two countries to plan an international 
rescue mission. But special forces sent in by the U.S. to survey the 
situation discovered that most of the refugees had already escaped.

British
 Prime Minister David Cameron said his country would shift it's focus to
 providing food and water to the hundreds of thousands of displaced 
Iraqis, many of whom are camped out in the independent region of 
Kurdistan, Syria and Turkey.

Cameron
 rushed back from vacation yesterday to oversee his country's response 
to the humanitarian crisis while Obama stayed put at Martha's Vineyard.

Obama
 is not scheduled to return to Washington until Sunday. He'll spend two 
days at the White House attending meetings and then return to Martha's 
Vineyard to finish out his vacation.

While
 the president has refused to cancel his holiday or come back early, he attempted to stay out of public the eye on Wednesday.

In an interview last weekend, Mrs Clinton described U.S. policy in Syria as a failure and said Obama's doctrine of "'don't do stupid stuff" is not an organising principle' for a great nation

Water under the bridge: 'We have disagreements as any partners and friends, as we are, might very well have,' Clinton told reporters crowded into a bookstore signing of her memoir Hard Choices yesterday

On
 the first four days of his trip Obama went golfing three times and took
 a trip to the beach with his family. Yesterday, he opted not to leave 
his vacation home except to attend Mrs. Jordan's birthday party at Farm 
Neck Golf Club, where he was expected to rendezvous with Clinton.

The former rivals' meet-up at last 
night's party was hotly anticipated in the wake of Clinton's criticisms of Obama's approach to 
foreign policy in an interview with the Atlantic that was released over 
the weekend.

'Great
 nations need organizing principles, and "don't do stupid stuff" is not 
an organizing principle,' she said, referring to a version of the phrase
 Obama and his advisers have used privately to describe his approach to 
foreign policy.

The former Secretary of State's critique
 came at a particularly challenging time for Obama, with bombs falling 
on Iraq and disputes raging in Syria, the Mideast, Ukraine and 
elsewhere.

Obama has continued on his vacation in Martha's Vineyard as displaced members of the Yazidi community were evacuated from from the Sinjar Mountains. Thousands of displaced Iraqis are now fleeing into Syria through the Fishkhabur bridge over the Tigris river in Northern Iraq

Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are now displaced and are living in refugee camps in Syria, Turkey and the Kurdish region

An Obama spokesman said yesterday that the White House 'is looking onwards and upwards,' while Clinton
 joked she was planning on hugging it off with her former boss.

'We
 have disagreements as any partners and friends, as we are, might very 
well have,' Clinton told reporters crowded into a bookstore signing of 
her memoir Hard Choices yesterday.

'But I'm proud that I served with him and for him, and I'm looking forward to seeing him tonight.'

The
 media was not allowed in to see whether Clinton delivered her promised 
make-up hug after she tried to set herself apart from the unpopular 
Obama in a recent interview, but Schultz insisted yesterday that Clinton and Obama 'have had many hugs over the years' and the forthcoming one would be no different.

A former top Obama adviser, David 
Axelrod, took to Twitter to jab Clinton back: 'Just to clarify: "Don't 
do stupid stuff" means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, 
which was a tragically bad decision.'

Clinton voted in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, while Obama voiced opposition.

The
 very public foreign policy disagreement was Clinton's biggest split 
with Obama since their 2008 presidential primary campaign when she 
questioned whether her younger Senate colleague was qualified to take a 3
 a.m. phone call on an emergency.

Clinton
 took a more hawkish stance than Obama in that campaign, particularly on
 the Iraq War, but Obama put their bitter contest behind them by naming 
her his top diplomat.

Hillary Clinton and Obama attended the same birthday party last night in Martha's Vineyard but reporters were not allowed in. The last time Obama was seen publicly outside of the party was on Tuesday, when he was spotted playing golf in the afternoon and dining with his wife and several members of his administration at a local restuarant

Clinton
 loyally carried out Obama's foreign policy agenda for four years but 
described some objections she raised internally in Hard Choices, which 
focuses on her time in the administration.

She
 expanded on those objections in her Atlantic interview, saying Obama's 
'failure' to fully support the rebels in Syria fueled the rise of 
Islamic State militants now the object of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

Reporters
 who crowded in front of a table set up for Clinton's signing at the 
Bunch of Grapes bookstore yesterday asked her whether she disagreed with
 Obama's Iraq policy.

'I'm 
excited about signing books,' she said, turning to a line of hundreds 
that snaked through the rainy streets near the ferry dock that brings 
summer visitors to the island.

About 1,000 copies of the book were bought in advance, and the store was open only for those who had made the purchases.

Schultz
 declined to say whether the president was upset over her critique of 
his performance as he juggles several crises overseas, although he 
acknowledged 'an honest policy difference' on the Syrian rebels.

The
 deputy press secretary said Obama appreciated that Clinton called the 
president Tuesday to say she was not trying to attack him.

'They have a close and resilient relationship,' Schultz said.
