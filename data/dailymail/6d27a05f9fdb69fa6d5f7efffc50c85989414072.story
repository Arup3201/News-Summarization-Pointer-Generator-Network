Oscar became the first Premier League player to score at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, and took just one game to get off the mark for the host nation.

The Chelsea midfielder's 91st-minute outside-of-the-foot curler past Croatia goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa sealed the 3-1 win after Neymar scored twice, getting Brazil off to a perfect start.

Oscar's Chelsea team-mate David Luiz went close earlier in the World Cup opener - as did Hull City's Nikica Jelavic for Croatia - but it was Oscar who got the ball rolling for the Premier League in Brazil.

Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari hailed the impact of Chelsea midfielder Oscar.

He said: 'Neymar got man of the match, but if there was a second award it should go to Oscar.

'Our
 statistics after the game shows he was the one who made the most 
tackles, and made lots of dribbles and crosses - he was our most 
creative player on the right.

'He was fantastic and that's the kind of player he is and I have always believed in him.

'Any doubts came from your side [the media]. His level may have dropped but I never lost belief in him.'

Neymar admitted he had had a dream start to the World Cup.

The Barcelona forward said: 'I think I am happier than I ever dreamt, to start with a victory in the World Cup such as this.

'The whole team deserves praise for being able to keep calm and turn things around.'

Neymar's second goal came from the spot after a controversial penalty described by Croatia's coach Niko Kovac as 'ridiculous', who added that none of the billions watching on TV saw it as a foul.

However, Scolari said: 'Millions didn't see the penalty? The referee did and he said it was a penalty and they are the ones that must decide.

'We also think it was a penalty. I have seen it 10 times and I think it is a penalty.'
