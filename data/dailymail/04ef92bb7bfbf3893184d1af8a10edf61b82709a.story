Medicine balls, the fitness tool
as ancient as Hippocrates, have bounced, slammed, tossed and
twisted their way into today's trendiest workouts, fitness
experts say.

The durable, versatile spheres, which can range from 2 to 25
pounds (0.9 to 11 kg), fit into today's most intense regimes,
from boot camps to interval training.

Alonzo Wilson, creator of the New York City fitness studio
Tone House, uses medicine ball exercises to strengthen and
condition, and to boost team spirit.

On trend: Medicine balls, a fitness aid once endorsed by Hippocrates, are central to modern workouts again

He said the people who seek out his brand of extreme
athletics often find medicine balls less daunting than his
resistance harnesses or cords and ropes.

'They make people feel comfortable,' said Wilson, a former
professional athlete. 'We use them in partner throws, to hold
and turn, to touch the ground with. Slamming the ball down while
(jumping) in the air elevates the heart rate.'

In a fast-moving workout, he added, the balls allow freedom
of movement.

'With a lot of machinery you're kind of stuck,' he said.
'But with the med ball you can run, jump, grab it, slam it and
hold it while not staying in one spot.'

Daniel Taylor, the author of 'Conditioning to the Core,'
believes versatility is the secret of the medicine ball's
successful trickle-down from elite athletics to everyday
workouts.

Taylor, head strength and conditioning coach at Siena
College in Loudonville, New York, said at the most basic level
it is a user-friendly weight for people who are nervous about
weights.

'A push-up executed with a hand on a medicine ball will train
stability,' he said. 'Throw or slam it (from overhead or against
a wall), it can train power efficiently and well.'

But novices should start in the lighter range, advises
Deborah McConnell, master trainer at equipment manufacturer Life
Fitness.

She said the balls reappeared with the rise of boot camp and
small group training classes. Ancient drawings date the medicine
ball to almost 3,000 years ago, when Persian wrestlers trained
with sand-filled bladders.

In ancient Greece, the physician Hippocrates is said to have
stuffed animal skins for patients to toss for 'medicinal'
purposes. Gladiators used them to prepare for the arena.

The last great medicine ball revival was in the early 1900s.

'There was a game called the Hooverball, like volleyball
with a medicine ball tossed over the net,' said McConnell about
the trend that started when President Herbert Hoover's physician
suggested his overweight patient use the ball to shape up.

Chris Freytag, a health and fitness coach with the American
Council on Exercise, said the latest comeback spurred a rebirth
of other weighted balls.

The medicine ball is like a heavy basketball and made to
bounce, she explained, while the slam ball is made to slam
without breaking and the deadweight ball is sand-filled and does
not bounce.

'Now it's this chic thing,' she said, 'maybe because it
feels more like playing. You're not going to toss a hand
weight.'
