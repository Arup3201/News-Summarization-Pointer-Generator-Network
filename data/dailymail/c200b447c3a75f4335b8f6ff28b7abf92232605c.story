Bristling with high-tech weaponry but with a little help from man's best friend, soldiers of the Force Troops Command, a whole new wing of the British army, showcase their specialist capabilities as they prepare to go fully operational next week.

Infantrymen, divers, medics, artillery units, dog teams, missile specialists and chefs headed out to Upavon Airfield on the edge of Salisbury Plain yesterday for the major joint exercise.

The Force Troops Command (FTC), which is due to go fully operational on April 1, is the first major implementation 
of 'Army 2020' - the concept for transforming the British army.

Army chiefs say it will deliver 'specialist, combat and command Support 
through Regular and Reserve soldiers'.

By 2015 FTC will be the largest of
 the Army's formations, made up of nine functional brigades and the 
Engineer and Logistics Staff Corps, in total representing a third of the
 whole force.
