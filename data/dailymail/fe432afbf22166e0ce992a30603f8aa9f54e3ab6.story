Images have emerged that show a heroic boyfriend physically shielding his girlfriend in the aftermath of the Boston bombings and then carrying her to safety.

Standing only feet from the finishing line of the marathon when the first bomb was detonated, Kaitylnn Cates, 25, almost lost her leg in the blast.

Fearing more devastation, her boyfriend, 41-year-old Leo Fonseca dived on top of Cates to protect her as the second explosion ripped through the crowd a hundred yards away.

Hero: Leo Fonseca rushes his girlfriend Kaitlynn Cates (center) away from the scene of the first blast at the Boston marathon finishing line in the aftermath of the first blast on Monday April 15th.

Panicked, Fonseca scooped his girlfriend into his arms, ran to his car and frantically drove two-miles through the stunned streets of Boston until he reached Massachusetts General Hospital - where staff didn't even know bombs had gone off yet.

'Leo tried to hook his body around me. He literally straddled me and said 'Stay down. Stay down' because I was trying to get up and he didn't know if there was going to be another bomb,' said Cates who lives near Boston in Everett.

One week after the Boston bombing and the huge man-hunt for suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left four people dead and over 180 injured, Cates is thankful for the brave actions of her boyfriend.

'I don’t know if I would have made it if I would have had to wait for the emergency workers,' said Cates in an interview with the Boston Globe on Wednesday. 'He was an absolute hero.'

Recalling the carnage that unfolded during the aftermath of the blasts, Cates is pleased that Fonseca was so quick thinking.

'Bodies had fallen back on us and I started to crawl under them to get away,' said Cates. 'Then he picked me up and I started yelling 'Get me out of here. Get me to your car. Get me to your car.'

Using his own sweatshirt to tie around Cate's leg and stem the bleeding, Fonseca then drove the wrong way through the streets of Boston to get his girlfriend to hospital.

'Leo drove the wrong way down Exeter and Beacon streets, dodging emergency vehicles and got me to Massachusetts General Hospital in about eight minutes,' said Cates.

'I was the first person here and the staff didn't even know bombs had (gone) off yet.'

The happy couple have been going out for ten-months and were cheering on the runners at the finish line on Monday April 15th's Boston marathon

Kaitlynn Cates met President Obama on Thursday when he came to the terror affected city for an inter-faith service

Praising the 'phenomenal' hospital staff, Cates got to meet President Obama when he visited Boston on Thursday to attend an inter-faith service for the bombing victims.

'I was very happy that he came and acknowledged such a terrible thing and brought some positive inspiration,' said Cates.

'Obama and Leo had a personal moment. They gave each other a hug. He was very sweet.'

Cates also said that she was happy that police have captured one bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19. His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died during a gun battle with police in the Boston suburb of Watertown.

Doctors have saved Cates's leg and Fonseca has spent every minute possible by her bedside watching over her.

'I’ve been watching the news, and I’m so grateful they have captured the perpetrators.'
