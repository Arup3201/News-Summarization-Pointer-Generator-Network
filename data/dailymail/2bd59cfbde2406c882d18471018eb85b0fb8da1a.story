Arsene Wenger fears Olivier Giroud will be ruled out until the New Year, leaving Arsenal to consider a late plunge into the transfer market before Monday’s deadline.

Wenger tried to push concerns aside to avoid distractions ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League play-off second leg against Besiktas but admitted Giroud could face a long time out after a freak injury.

The striker was hurt when the ball smashed into the sole of his boot in the final seconds of Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Everton, pushing the toe-end of the foot upwards towards the shin, causing a small fracture near his ankle.

‘I still don’t understand how he did it,’ said Arsenal manager Wenger. ‘The problem I think is his tibia. He over-stretched his ankle that way. It was on the ball, not a contact.

‘He has had a medical check but we need to have further investigation. The first news is not fantastic but I am not a doctor. So I wait for the complete examination and decision for how long he will be out.’

Giroud will be assessed again by a specialist on Wednesday but when asked if it looked like a long-term injury, Wenger replied: ‘It can be, we’ll see. It’s sad for us, but for the moment we are focused on this game. It is very important. We have started the season quite well, with three good games. We want to continue to grow and win our games.’

Arsenal are also without captain Mikel Arteta, who twisted an ankle in the goalless first leg and influential midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who is banned after a red card in Istanbul.

Kieran Gibbs has a hamstring problem and Theo Walcott, out since January with a knee injury, will not be rushed back, with both set to return after next month’s international break.

Lone man? Summer signing Alexis Sanchez is an option for Arsene Wenger up front against Besiktas

Option: Yaya Sanogo is a more natural forward, but there are still reservations over his consistency and ability

Transfer: Lukas Podolski seemed in high spirits despite speculation linking him with a move away

Arsenal’s poor injury record has been criticised in the past but Wenger said: ‘We do not have any muscular problems apart from Gibbs. Overall that is quite good compared to other clubs. The other injuries are Arteta with an ankle problem and Giroud. You cannot plan for an injury like his in the 94th minute.’

The prospect of five months out for Giroud forces Wenger to contemplate an emergency dip into the market, even though it is something which goes against the grain for the Arsenal boss.

‘In England as soon as you have a problem people want you to buy,’ said Wenger. ‘I can give you clubs with plenty of players who every time they lose say they have to buy more. But if you give the number of strikers we have it is unbelievable.’

Wenger can choose between Yaya Sanogo, Joel Campbell, Lukas Podolski and Alexis Sanchez to lead the line against Besiktas. Sanchez is the favourite, despite failing to impress at Goodsion Park.

‘You do not convict a player on one half,’ said Wenger. ‘It was not all bad. There was some quality in what he did. I just felt, on the day, we needed some more physical presence.’

Arsenal are attempting to reach the group stages of the Champions League for the 17th successive year. They have won their last six of these play-off ties without ever seeming in danger.

Defeat at this stage would cost the Londoners an estimated £25million and, despite healthy cash reserves, it would not help the club buy a top-quality replacement for Giroud.

‘It will affect us because we will have less income,’ said Wenger. ‘But it will not affect our balance sheet in a dramatic way. We can survive without that. We want to be in the Champions League, we want to play top-level football.

‘Financially we have always adapted. When we had very small resources, we adapted to very small resources. We want to play at the top.’
