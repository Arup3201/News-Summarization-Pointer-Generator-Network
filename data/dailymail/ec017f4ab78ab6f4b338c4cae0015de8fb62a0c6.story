Two police officers were injured when a brawl involving 20 people broke out during a wedding reception at a luxury hotel.

Four men were arrested after two groups from separate parties became involved in a drunken punch-up at Ramside Hall, County Durham.

Police were called to £215-a-night hotel in the early hours of Monday to deal with a 'large scale disturbance'.

The officers were 'slightly injured' but were able to continue with their duties, Durham Police said.

A 63-year-old has been charged with assaulting a police officer and bailed to appear before Peterlee Magistrates' Court on September 4.

A 16-year-old was arrested in the fracas, and held on suspicion of affray, before being bailed pending further inquiries.

An 18-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and has  been released no further action. A 43-year-old was arrested on suspicion of affray and has received a caution.

Ramside Hall can hold up to 500 guests
for weddings and boasts: 'Your wedding day should be as trouble free 
and relaxed as possible'.

It
has 80 rooms, including two Presidential Suites, and a championship 
golf course but bosses refused to comment on the incident today.
