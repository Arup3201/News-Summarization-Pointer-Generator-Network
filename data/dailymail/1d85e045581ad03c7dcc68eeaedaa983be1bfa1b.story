A dairy farmer who is suspected of shooting dead his partner and then turning the gun on himself had earlier shot his ex-wife and her husband in front of six children in rural Victoria.

The bodies of Greg Murray, 43, and a 41-year-old woman, believed to be his girlfriend, were found by police at their Murrabit West property, 300km north of Melbourne, about 4.30am on Sunday while they were investigating an earlier shooting.

Police allege Murray had visited his ex-wife's house, who he separated from five years ago, in nearby Kerang on Saturday night armed with a gun and shot her in the neck and hand.

Murray allegedly shot his ex-wife in the neck and hand and her new husband in the shoulder. Both were treated in hospital following the attack

They say six children between three and 14 years were inside when Murray allegedly burst in at 11.30pm. Three were his children, two were his ex-wife's new husband's and one was a friend just having a sleepover, the Herald Sun reports.

The ex-wife, 42, was flown to Melbourne hospital to be treated. Her husband, 47, was shot in the shoulder when he and a neighbour tried to intervene and wrestle the gun away from Murray. He was treated at a local hospital.

Murray, who was the eldest of give children from a prominent local farming family, had reportedly been battling with his ex-wife to be allowed to see their children.

'He came to work very depressed one day because it had been difficult for him to see his kids,' a friend told the Age.

'Obviously he's kept getting denied, denied and denied and he's just snapped.

'He's a good kid from a good family and it's just a bloody tragedy.'

Murray had no criminal record, no intervention order against him and didn't have a gun license, according to Inspector Jamie Templeton.

'There was nothing to give us any indication. There was no history or signs of violence,' Insp Templeton said.

'We couldn't possibly see anything coming. This is a horrific crime, and traumatic for all involved. Itâ€™s a terrible set of circumstances.'

Detectives found Murray's vehicle about a kilometre away from his property.

They found his partner dead inside the house and Murray's body inside another car parked under the carport.

Both had suffered gun wounds but it is unclear whether Murray had killed his partner before heading to his ex-wife's home the night before.

Insp Templeton called the shootings 'extremely nasty' for everyone involved, particularly the children.

'The children were actually in the lounge room and heard a knock at the door, woke up the adults in the house and the husband went to the door... and saw the shotgun straight away,' he told the ABC.

'There's a number of people that are affected and it's a horrific crime scene and all the emergency services and other people involved, and of course families and friends and associates, there'll certainly be some ongoing support and welfare applied there.'

Police confirmed the family had no history of violence and are investigating if the guns came from a family friend who did not know they had been taken as the gunman did not have a gun license.

Investigators are not looking for any other person in relation to the incidents.
