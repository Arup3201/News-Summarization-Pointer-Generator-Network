A Florida woman was killed in a tragic Fourth of July accident Friday after fireworks she was preparing for a celebration exploded inside her home.

Kathryn Flint, 49, was fetching fireworks with her two dogs at her side from inside a bedroom in her Auburndale home when something set off one of the large fireworks.

The ignition of one resulted in all the mortar-style pyrotechnics tragically going off.
