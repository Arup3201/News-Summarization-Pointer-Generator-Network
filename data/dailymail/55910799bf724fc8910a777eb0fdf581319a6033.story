San Francisco said goodbye Thursday to Candlestick Park — the stadium 
where the city's beloved Giants and 49ers celebrated some of their 
greatest triumphs.

The storied venue shut down after an evening concert by former Beatle 
Paul McCartney that finished about midnight.

McCartney was a fitting final act, having played the venue for The Beatles final live concert in 1966.

'Thank you, San Francisco, for being cool now and for being cool back then,' he told the crowd at the end of his second and final encore, USA Today reported. 

The former Beatle closed out the stadium's storied life with a 150 minute performance covering classics from his mop-top heyday, classics from Wings and his solo career, and even a cover of Little Richard's 'Long Tall Sally.'

He finished his set with the apt 'Let It Be.'

San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee personally lobbied for McCartney to be Candlestick's final act.

Leading up to McCartney was a month of shows from major stars, including Beyonce and Jay Z, Justin Timberlake, Tom Petty, and Kanye West.

Candlestick Park will now be  be demolished 
to make way for a housing, retail and entertainment development.

The Stick, as it is known, opened more than 50 years ago and served as 
the home field for the 49ers and Giants.

It hosted greats from both 
teams, including Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and Willie Mays, and was the 
site of The Catch — Montana's touchdown pass to Dwight Clark to win the 
NFC championship game in January 1982 and send the 49ers to their first 
Super Bowl.

McCartney chose the bittersweet 'Let It Be' to close out the stadium's final night

The Giants played their last game at Candlestick in September 1999. The 
49ers will play at a new stadium about 45 miles south starting this 
year.

Candlestick was also the site of a 1987 mass by Pope John Paul II and the Beatles' last live concert in 1966.

'Anyone you talk to about Candlestick Park is going to have mixed 
emotions about it: it's not a pleasant place physically. It gets windy 
and cold, but it's where the Giants and 49ers played for so many years,'
 Greg Breit, 50, said before the concert's start. 'There's so much 
history here. You can't deny it.'

Twist and shout: Spectators watch the Beatles perform at Candlestick Park on August 29, 1966

Fans savored the final event at The Stick by holding tailgate parties 
and taking snapshots of the stadium before the late-afternoon fog rolled
 in.

San Francisco police warned people attending Thursday's concert not to 
take any chairs or other mementos from the stadium, saying anyone caught
 with such items could face vandalism charges.

'We don't want people to be trying to take any pieces of Candlestick 
Park,' Officer Gordon Shyy told KGO-TV. 'Just come enjoy the concert 
tonight and have a safe night.'
