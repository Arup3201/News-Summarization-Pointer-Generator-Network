A Russian man who killed his estranged wife by throwing petrol over her and setting her alight while she was at work in a supermarket has been jailed.

Shocking CCTV images  of the attack that shows the 25-year-old victim going up in flames and running through the store caused outrage across Russia, and led to widespread calls for a crackdown on violence against women.

Murderer Alexander Efimov, 33, had drunk a bottle of vodka and was three times over the drink driving limit when he was arrested - and initially said the attack was his wife Ana's fault, because she refused to get back together with him.
