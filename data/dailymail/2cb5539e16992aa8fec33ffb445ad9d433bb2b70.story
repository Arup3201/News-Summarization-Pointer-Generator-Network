Britain and the US can only defend their freedoms if they boost their economic strength, David Cameron and Barack Obama say today.

The two leaders, speaking as Mr Cameron arrived in Washington for talks with the US President, said they agreed on a series of measures that would bolster both economies against another global downturn.

Officials say Mr Cameron and Mr Obama will link economic security and national security – arguing the West can only protect its citizens and its values if it retains its economic dominance.

In a joint statement today they said: ‘We’re working to help families stake their claim to a better future and buy their first home. 

'We’re supporting small businesses, expanding apprenticeships, improving education for all, and backing increases in the minimum wage.' 

The Prime Minister will today join International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde for talks on the global economic outlook for the year – with warnings lights again flashing in the Eurozone.

The Prime Minister and President Obama added: ‘Over the last few years, our governments have worked closely to restore economic growth, improve our living standards and make sure families get the help they needed.

‘Yet we know that progress and prosperity are never guaranteed. As we meet today at the White House, we reaffirm our belief that our ability to defend our freedoms is rooted in our economic strength, and the values that we cherish – freedom of expression, the rule of law, and strong democratic institutions.

‘We must do all we can to bolster our economies against another global economic downturn.’

The leaders will meet today and tomorrow for talks on national security, particularly tackling the threat of violent extremism including the response to the terror attacks in Paris last week.

In a joint article in The Times, they added: 'Security and prosperity go hand in hand. By confronting the terrorists who threaten us, standing together against Russia’s aggressive acts and continuing our efforts to advance our economic growth, we will continue to advance the security and prosperity that our people deserve.'

Underlining the importance of the economic relationship between both countries, US and UK companies are also set to announce trade and investment deals worth more than £1.1 billion, creating 1,700 new jobs in the UK.
