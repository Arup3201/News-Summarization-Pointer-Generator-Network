Sheffield United fans continued their vocal support for convicted rapist Ched Evans during their side's 2-0 win over Yeovil on Tuesday night.

The Sheffield Star reported an isolated chant from the Kop shortly after kick-off, before two more chants followed with the home side leading 2-0.

Songs referring to Evans 'coming home', as well as support for 'Super Chedwyn Evans' could be heard at Bramall Lane, as United's win took them into the playoffs in League One. 

Ched Evans was released from prison this week, and Sheffield United fans chanted his name on Tuesday night

Bristol City's Aden Flint heads home in his side's match against Bradford at Ashton Gate

It has been a difficult week for the Blades after Evans' release from prison, and co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps are still in deliberation over whether to re-sign him despite an online petition with over 30,000 signatures against it. 

Elsewhere, league leaders Bristol City continued their unbeaten start to the season, but had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Bradford.

Aden Flint looked to have secured all three points for the Robins when he put them 2-1 up in the 82nd minute, but Christopher Routis' shot fired in off the woodwork to rescue a point for Bradford.

Bristol City have not lost in their last 20 matches in all competitions - a run stretching back to March - and this season is their best start to a league campaign in 60 years.

Notts County moved up to fifth and extended their unbeaten run to 10 games with a 2-3 away win at Barnsley. Michael Petrasso scored twice to ensure the three points for Shaun Derry's side.

Second-placed Peterborough were unable to capitalise on the leaders' dropped points as they lost 1-0 to struggling Crewe. Posh finished the game with nine men after central defenders Jack Baldwin and Michael Bostwick were both sent off.

At the opposite end of the League One table, Port Vale and Scunthorpe had to settle for a point apiece after a 2-2 draw which leaves the latter propping up the table in 24th position. 

Conor Henderson netted an 89th minute free-kick for Crawley, which saw the Red Devils climb away from the bottom four as they beat Walsall 1-0 at the Broadfield Stadium.

Swindon and Chesterfield both slipped out of the playoff places with losses to Rochdale and Colchester respectively.

An injury-time goal from Bastien Hery gave Rochdale a 3-2 win at the County Ground, while Freddie Sears late winner gave Colchester a 2-1 victory. 

Despite their heavy 4-1 loss at Oldham, Coventry stay outside the relegation zone on goal difference, while their opponents climbed to eighth in League One.
