When summer is up and it’s time to go back to school, children often suffer from a bout of 'back to school blues' as they begrudgingly return to class.

But a researcher has claimed that the effect isn’t limited to people; dogs also get upset when their young owners leave.

In a study they found that for many dogs this can leave them feeling abandoned, and some look for a way to lash out.

A researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts has found that dogs get separation anxiety (stock image shown). It occurs when their young owners go back to school at the end of summer. Dr Dodman says this can leave the dogs feeling lonely and abandoned. In extreme cases this can lead to them lashing out

The research was compiled by Dr Nick Dodman of Tufts University's Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in Massachusetts.

Make your departure a happy time with toys and treats.

Create a place in the house where the dog feels safe.

Start the new routine before school begins.

Don't indulge behavior with baby talk or sympathy.

See a vet if it doesn't improve. 

He found that many of the 80 million dogs in the US had separation anxiety. 

This led them to bark, howl or whine when their owners were gone.

In more extreme cases the departure of a young owner to school at the start of school can lead to the dogs scratching doors, damaging blinds or tearing curtains in their anxiety.

And the side effects of children going back to school don't stop there; Dr Dodman also says that some dogs refuse to eat when their owners are gone.

‘There will be an exuberant greeting when you do come home, one that can last several minutes and be completely crazy, then the dog will run to the food bowl,’ he said.

For
 millions of dogs across the US, summer is gone and so are their best 
buddies. Most dogs object for a while but eventually adjust to the new 
hours.  But millions of others will feel abandoned, panicky, sad and 
unable to cope as they look for ways to lash out, according to research 
by Dr Nick Dodman of Tufts University

In addition, nearly half of anxious dogs were found to have noise phobias, so if a storm hits while they are in an empty house, they can panic. 

Dr Dodman suggests that to ease anxiety in dogs, the departure of children to school should be made a happy time with toys and treats. 

He also suggests creating a place in the house where the dog feels safe. 

But ultimately, if the condition of the dog doesn’t improve he suggests seeing a vet is the best option.
