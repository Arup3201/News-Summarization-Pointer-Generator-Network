Raheem Sterling made his return to action - and his retrun to Loftus Road- on Sunday as Liverpool beat QPR 3-2 in a pulsating game.

The youngster missed England's last fixture because he was 'tired', so Sportsmail's SAMI MOKBEL kept a close eye on the midfielder.

All eyes — including those of the England manager Roy Hodgson — were on Sterling after a week of controversy. The Liverpool teenager has a quiet opening against his former club at Loftus Road.

Jovial home supporters sing: ‘Raheem Sterling, he sleeps when he wants’, as the England midfielder struggles to make an impact on the game. Maybe he was a bit tired...

Slowly but surely the youngster’s impact grows — one run in the final moments of the first half is classic Sterling. Picking up the ball inside his own half, he drives forward with pace and power. 

He passes to Adam Lallana before being clattered by Richard Dunne, but picks himself up to get in a good position at the edge of the box only for Mario Balotelli to hit a wayward shot.

Emerges for the second half full of energy and not looking lethargic by any stretch of the imagination. 

Liverpool struggled to get the ball to Sterling during the first half, but at the start of the second he comes looking for it and QPR have difficulty dealing with his movement. 

One breathtaking run down the right wing in the 60th minute could have led to Liverpool’s opener, had it not been for the wastefulness in front of goal of Balotelli

If any doubts lingered over Sterling’s fitness, he emphatically answered every question posed in the final 25 minutes. In a word: awesome. 

Sterling won the game for a team who seemed intent on throwing three points away. Firstly, his razor-sharp thinking to take a quick free-kick led to Liverpool’s opener. 

His pace and power through the heart of QPR’s midfield was a key feature of his side’s second. And he combined that physicality with astute awareness to force Steven Caulker’s own goal as Liverpool grabbed a dramatic winner. 

He left the field to a chorus of boos, but won’t have cared one iota. Tired? No chance.
