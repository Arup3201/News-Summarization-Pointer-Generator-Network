A father was shot by terrorists as he bravely shielded a four-year-old child from gunfire when the Nairobi mall came under attack.

Simon Belcher, who was privately educated in Britain, was hiding under a car with his wife and the child, who was not related to them, when the Kenyan military began returning fire on the Al Shabaab militants.

As the terrorists ducked to avoid the gunfire, they spotted the group and shot Mr Belcher. The bullet went through his shoulder and chest, but miraculously missed his vital organs.

Mr Belcher, who is Kenyan and runs a safari company from his home in Nairobi, is recovering in hospital with his wife by his bedside. She wrote on Facebook that they were ‘very, very lucky.’

Meanwhile a British consultant was last night mourning the loss of his wife in the Kenyan mall massacre - while recovering in hospital from gun and grenade wounds he suffered in the attack.

Niall Saville, who grew up in Farndon, Nottinghamshire, is thought to have undergone surgery at Aghakan hospital in Nairobi after being shot in the shoulder at the Westgate shopping centre.

But the 35-year-old University of Cambridge graduate’s wife Kang Moon-hee, 38 - a software developer who was shot and suffered shrapnel wounds from a grenade - died in hospital on Sunday.

The couple had been married for five 
years - and moved to Kenya earlier this year. Mr Saville is a specialist
 in economic growth and lives in Nairobi, working for global development
 advisors Dalberg.

A company spokesman said: ‘All of us at Dalberg are deeply shocked and saddened by the horrific attack in Nairobi.

'I hope that you’re okay and that your surgery goes well. Keeping you in my thoughts'

‘Like many in the city, our colleagues in Dalberg’s Nairobi office have been affected by the attacks both directly and indirectly. 

‘As a firm, we are focused on supporting our colleagues, their families and friends, and the broader effort to aid those affected by the attack.’

Mr Saville’s parents, retired headmaster Lewis Saville and his wife Margaret, flew out to Kenya from their home in Farndon on Monday to be at their son’s bedside.

A neighbour, who did not wish to be 
named, said: ‘I spoke to Lewis before they flew out. They are both 
absolutely devastated. It’s an awful thing and has really upset them.

‘Niall hasn’t lived in this country for years but was still very close to his parents and kept in touch regularly.’

Shocked
 friends sent messages of support to Mr Saville on Twitter. Charlotte Bullock said: ‘I hope that you’re okay and that your 
surgery goes well. Keeping you in my thoughts.’

After leaving university, Mr Saville worked in South Korea, Singapore, France, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia before settling in Kenya.

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said last night  that the terrorists who took control of the mall and held off Kenyan security forces for four days were defeated after killing at least 67 civilians and government troops.

He said those killed include 61 civilians whose bodies have been recovered so far and six security forces, while some 175 were injured, including 62 who remain in hospital.

Three floors of the mall collapsed and several bodies were trapped in the rubble. His office later said a terrorist's body was among those in the debris. Five other militants were killed by gunfire.
