A British climber miraculously escaped death twice after being pummelled with rocks 'the size of cars' while ice climbing in New Zealand.

Krystle Morley, 28, had just completed her lifetime ambition of ice climbing in New Zealand when rocks began to hurtle down the glacier towards her as she waited to be rescued by helicopter.

The climbers ran to take cover at the edge of a helipad but, just minutes after the rocks stopped flying over their heads, a second fall was triggered.

After completing an ice climb in New Zealand, 28-year-old Krystle Morley found herself faced with death during not one - but two - rockfalls on the Franz Joseph Glacier (pictured)

Krystle, from Sheffield, miraculously escaped with just a small bump on her head.

She described her brush with death: 'I heard this massive thunderclap. I turned round and I saw a mass of cloud and rocks and noticed our guide's face had gone from normal to sheer panic as the rocks started to hurl towards us.'

'I had my hands over my head to protect it because even the smaller rocks could've wiped me out.'

'Boulders the size of cars and fridges were flying past us, and one the size of a microwave seemed to skim past my head.'

'We were hunkered down for what seemed like forever and I was just thinking, "Any minute now, we're going to get crushed."'

'Boulders the size of cars and fridges were flying past us, and one the size of a microwave seemed to skim past my head,' Krystle remembers of the experience 

The West Yorkshire native was backpacking around New Zealand and on that day, the group had spent the day scaling Franz Joseph Glacier in South Island.

The Sheffield Hallam University environmental sciences student said she was 'buzzing' after surviving the first rockfall.

But the second struck as the climbers were waiting to board the helicopter - forcing it to take off without them.

'I was thinking, "I've just cheated death!," and not many people can say that - so I was buzzing.'

'When the second rockfall happened my sense of humour failed - I just wanted to get off the ice.'

'I just thought, "Get me out of here" - whereas before I was thinking, "Yes, I'm alive.".'

Sheffield native Krystle Morley's lifetime ambition was to try ice climbing in New Zealand

After the second rockfall the group was able to make it safely back to base, but Krystle suffered from severe paranoia for several days and returned home to Sheffield early.

She still climbs, and has chosen to learn more about natural hazards as part of her course. 

She says the experience has given her a new perspective on life.

'I'd cheated death twice and was convinced it was coming for me but it is an awesome story,' she said.

'It's made me a lot stronger and more determined to not shy away from something just because I'm nervous or I don't like it.'
