The couple who saved a newborn baby's life in Merced, California are planning to adopt the baby girl found abandoned in their apartment building's dumpster last week. 

Jimmy and Annette Alvarez found the little girl after hearing Jorge Miranda scream around 5:45am at the Sunnyside Apartment Complex last Thursday.  

Jimmy immediately wrapped the baby in his t-shirt and his wife warmed her up with her hands, which led the child to take a deep breath and come back to life. 

Police have since identified the baby's mother as a 13-year-old girl who is bound for Child Protective Services.

Found: A newborn baby girl was found in this dumpster beneath pizza boxes and various pieces of trash

The Alvarezes, former foster parents who have 37 grandchildren and great-grandchildren, now plan to become parents again after filing papers to adopt the little girl they've named Milagro - Spanish for 'miracle'.

Mr Alvarez described the heartbreaking moment he found baby Milagro to the Merced Sun-Star. 

Jorge Miranda was looking through the trash bin for cans and bottles early that morning when he found the hours-old baby under discarded pizza boxes and plastic trash bags.

The Alvarezes heard the scream and came running to the trash area, where they found a confused and shocked Mr Miranda with the baby.

'He was shocked, he was scared,' Mr Alvarez said of Mr Miranda.

'The baby was lying in the corner of the dumpster, half naked, the umbilical cord hanging.'

Alvarez wrapped the child in his shirt and his wife then held the baby until police arrived.

He asked the paramedics if he could name the child 'Milagro' which means miracle.

'It was a miracle she was there; it was a miracle she was found. I’m just grateful it wasn't dumpster day.'

Hospitals, fire stations, and police stations are 'Safe Surrender' stations where mother's may drop their babies less than three days old without any questions asked.

'We also have information available if someone drops a baby off and later wants them back,' said Billy Alcorn, acting battalion chief.

Local  police eventually found the 13-year-old mother who admitted to abandoning the baby. She received medical treatment and doctors confirmed that she recently gave birth. The unidentified mother is currently in the county's care and will be transferred into the custody of Child Protective Services.    

Miracle: Jimmy Alvarez presents a gift to the baby he calls Milagros meaning miracle because the baby is lucky to be alive after being abandoned in the trash can
