Michael Schumacher is 'fighting', the former Ferrari racing boss has said, adding that he believes the ex driving ace will get better.

Jean Todt spoke on Schumacher's condition shortly after visiting him at his Swiss mansion where he is being cared for in a purpose-built medical suite.

The 45-year-old former race ace returned to his home with his wife and children two months ago after being discharged from a rehabilitation clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Fighting back: A former racing boss has said Michael Schumacher, pictured in December 2013, is 'fighting'

Schumacher spent time in the rehab clinic after coming out of his medically-induced coma following a ski accident in the French Alps on December 29 last year, which left him with catastrophic brain injuries.

'What's important is that he lives and that his family is with him. We really believe that things will get better. He needs time and to be left alone,' Jean Todt said.

 'We can say that he can probably never again drive a Formula 1 car. But he is fighting.'

President of the International Automobile Federation Jean Todt, said that Schumacher will never drive a Formula 1 car again

'In the past weeks and months, he has made progress in relation to the severity of his injury,' said Todt, now president of the International Automobile Federation after visiting him last week.

'But a long and hard road is in front of him. Hopefully things will improve. His family is close to him. He needs time and peace.'

Schumacher is being cared for by a team of 15 experts at his home. It is understood he remains immobile and unable to speak.

The team at Gland, where a purpose-built mini-clinic has been constructed inside the Schumacher mansion, consists of 15 people, most of them provided by the Lausanne clinic. 

His care at home is estimated to be costing his family 100,000 pounds per month.

At the end of the year his father Rolf is moving from his home in Germany into a specially constructed residence built for him in the grounds of the 35 million pound Schumacher mansion at Gland, on the shores of Lake Geneva.
