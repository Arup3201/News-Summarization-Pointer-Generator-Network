The financial crash has left the poor even poorer than they were before the recession – while the rich have got richer, a new report has revealed.

Despite the economic collapse in 2008, the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two-thirds between 2005 and 2012/13.

The poorest families meanwhile have seen a collapse in their savings and higher debts than before the downturn, a report by the Social Market Foundation think-tank found.

The report said those aged 25 to 36 and those on the lowest incomes are 'ill-prepared for future financial shocks or rises in interest rates', limiting the capacity of consumer spending to fuel growth in the UK economy.

It cast doubt on claims that the UK population as a whole had reined in spending in order to pay off debts and build up savings in response to the crash.

In fact, it found that most of the saving took place among the top 20 per cent of earners, who built up savings in the aftermath of the crisis to the point that their average financial wealth increased by 64 per cent between 2005 and 2012/13.

The proportion of high-income individuals with debts fell from 43 per cent to 31 per cent over the same period.

By contrast, the 20 per cent on the lowest incomes were unable to pay off debts and start saving.

Over the same period, the value of debt held by poorer households rose by 67 per cent - equivalent to around 28 per cent of their income - and use of overdrafts rose, while savings shrank to an average of less than six days' worth of income.

The intergenerational gap in incomes and wealth widened over the same period, as the amount of savings held by 26-35 year-olds fell by 36 per cent.

While the proportion of this age-group in debt fell, the average amount owed by those with debts increased by 45 per cent.

Just 45 per cent of 26 to 35-year-olds owned a home in 2012/13, sharply down from the 74 per cent seen in 2005.

The report's co-author, SMF chief economist Nida Broughton, said: 'Our findings show that the wealth gap between rich and poor and young and old increased further during the downturn.

'The economic uncertainty following the crisis prompted many to pay down their debts and build up their savings. But the young and those on low incomes missed out.

'Greater support is needed to help these individuals prepare for the future; yet this will be a challenging feat. It is likely that the process of repairing their personal finances will only begin once sustained wage growth materialises.'
