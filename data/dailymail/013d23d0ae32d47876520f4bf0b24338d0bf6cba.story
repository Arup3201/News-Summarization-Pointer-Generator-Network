The head of one of Monaco's richest families has died from gunshot wounds following a suspected Mafia hit.

Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old heiress who was close to the royals who run the Mediterranean principality, was hit by a hail of bullets on May 6.

She and her chauffeur were attacked outside L'Archet hospital in the French city of Nice, which is a short drive from Monaco.

Forensic experts investigate the car in which Helene Pastor was critically injured on May 6

It is believed Mrs Pastor has been visiting her son in hospital before the shooting happened

Now Mrs Pastor has died in Nice's St Roch hospital, where medics had carried out a number of operations.

Her driver, 64-year-old Mohammed Darwish, also succumbed to wounds in the face, neck and stomach – dying on May 10.

Investigators suspect two of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates, the 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra, of carrying out the double assassination.

Both crime gangs are said to be building property portfolios on the French Riviera as they expand their field of operations.

Mrs Pastor's family own buildings worth billions in the area, and detectives believe the Mafia were trying to muscle in.

Mrs Pastor had been visiting her son, Gildo, who runs a car hire company, at the Nice hospital when a solo gunman struck.

Witnesses said the gunman used a large pump-action shotgun in the suspected 'hit'

Reports suggest Mrs Pastor's driver may have been the main target of the shooting

Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family

In a classic Mafia-style hit, he shot both Mrs Pastor and her chauffer in the head and stomach  with a pump-action shotgun through their car window.

Following the attack, the hit man jumped into a waiting getaway car drive by another man, and then sped off.

A witnesss said: 'I saw the gunman turn back towards me with his big gun and a bag. I thought he was coming for me. I was terrified for my life.'

French MP Eric Ciotti expressed his 'extreme shock' at the double assassination, while Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family.

Mrs Pastor was the sister of Michel Pastor, the former chairman of AS Monaco football club who died in February.

The Marseille prosecutor has now opened a judicial enquiry into the double murder, parts of which were captured on CCTV.  

'We are studying frozen images of the attack in an attempt to identify the attackers, and witnesses,' said an investigating source.

He said that an alleged blackmailer had been contacting the Pastor family, and was currently undergoing 'psychiatric tests'.

The source said: 'He claims to know the background to the attack, but his version may be based on what he has seen in the media.'

Mrs Pastor's grandfather was an Italian immigrant who developed large part of Monaco before handing his business over to her father, Gildo Pastor.

The principality is a tax haven which is regularly linked with organised crime gangs, as well as prominent individuals who want to keep the source of their wealth a closely guarded secret.
