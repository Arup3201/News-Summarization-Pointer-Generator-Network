 

The shirt worn by the Navy SEAL soldier who shot dead Osama bin Laden will be put on public display this Sunday at New York City's 9/11 Memorial Museum in time for the 13th anniversary.

It was secured by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and will be become the latest exhibit at the $700 million museum dedicated to the memory of the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives that day.

While the identity of the man who put three bullets into Osama bin Laden inside his secret Pakistan hideaway on May 2, 2011 has not been revealed, the simple brown shirt will be the most overt relic of the terror masterminds death at the memorial.

'This shirt is a symbol of the bravery of the US Navy SEAL Team 6, who risked their lives,' said Maloney.

While the official line from the museum is that the shirt only belongs to a member of the SEAL team who stormed the Abbottabad complex, sources have told the New York Post that the shirt is the one worn by bin Laden's shooter.

Displaying the shirt is an important exhibit for the museum, said Maloney, brushing off any hint of controversy about displaying it.

'It’s important that they tell the entire story, not just the story of the 9/11 attacks,' she said to the New York Post.

While the actual shooters identity has never been revealed, snippets of information about the soldier who killed the most wanted man on Earth have trickled out over the past three years.

Shot dead: Osama bin Laden was killed by the unidentified member of the special forces team on May 2, 2011 at his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound

Secret: The mission was years in the planning and was the least preferred option of President Obama's political team

Hearts in mouth: President Obama, with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and vice president Joe Biden, watched the raid unfold in front of their eyes back in Washington D.C.

Now retired, it was revealed the special-forces solider has suffered a breakdown in his marriage and is so concerned about being identified that he refused to meet families of 9/11 victims to preserve his anonymity, said the New York Post.

In an interview with Esquire magazine in February 2013, the shooter described in extraordinary detail the heart-stopping two minutes that changed the course of history.

In the Esquire interview The Shooter reveals that once they were given their mission, the female CIA agent - portrayed by Jessica Chastain's Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - told the team that bin Laden was '100 per cent on the third floor' of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

'We got him,' she told us. 'This is him. This is my life's work. I'm positive.'

Once he locked eyes on his target, the SEAL remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head.

He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see.

He also said he feared she might try to blow them up. He added: ‘I don’t know if she’s got a vest and she’s being pushed to martyr them both.

'I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].

'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place.

'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.

'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**.

'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.'

The Shooter also says that the night before the raid, all the members of Team Six wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down bin Laden.

He described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death, 'something for them to read when they are 35'.
