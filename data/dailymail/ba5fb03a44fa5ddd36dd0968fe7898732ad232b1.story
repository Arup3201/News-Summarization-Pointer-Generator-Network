The investments of one in three savers are being eroded by fund managers who charge rip-off fees for doing ‘virtually nothing’, it is claimed.

Millions of middle-class Britons pay investment firms to ensure their pensions or stocks and shares Isas yield higher returns.

But in up to a third of cases, managers are simply tracking their return on the FTSE stock market, which requires little effort or skill.

One in three savers are apparently being charged rip-off fees by fund managers who do 'virtually nothing' except track their return on the FTSE stock market, it has been claimed (file picture, posed by models)

Known as ‘closet trackers’, these funds charge high fees in return for ‘active management’ – when in fact investors are doing little more than mirroring the mainstream index.

Now the City watchdog says it is gathering evidence on whether investors have been misled. The Financial Conduct Authority will then decide what, if any, action to take.

The Daily Telegraph calculated that savers who invested in one of these funds missed out on up to £50,000 over a period of 30 years.

Gina Miller of campaign group True and Fair, which is campaigning for more transparency in the industry, said it was ‘fraud in all but name’.

She said: ‘If you take this definition of fraud – the use of false representations to gain an unjust advantage – this is fraud on an industrial scale.

‘Yet no one has been investigated, let alone charged or faced prosecution.’

Justin Modray, of investment firm Candid Financial Advice, said savers had been ‘paying over the odds for years’ on these funds, which are mostly run by banks.

‘In many cases the people running the investments are doing nothing more than what a dumb machine can do – there is no expertise involved whatsoever,’ he said. It comes just weeks after a lawsuit was filed against Sweden’s second largest fund house, Swedbank Robur, over claims it mis-sold investors ‘closet trackers’.

Critics said many firms are either too lazy or scared to actively invest people’s money properly and seek out the highest returns.

Andrew Telfer, at Edinburgh-based fund house Baillie Gifford, told the Financial Times: ‘There are many fund managers who are closet indexing and overcharging for that.

‘They have been a disservice to the industry.’

Savers typically pay 1.5 per cent a year for ‘active management’ of their investments, in the belief that fund managers will pick the best shares from across the stock market.

But a third of these managers investing in British companies simply copy the rise and the fall of the stock market, therefore generating mediocre returns. Miss Miller’s research found many funds were run by banks, insurers and building societies.

Among the worst offenders named was the Scottish Widows UK Growth fund which has £3billion of savers’ money, and the £5billion Halifax UK Growth.

A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group, which runs both funds, said such investments were ‘not actively marketed’.
