Cartagena and Lucena players protested months of unpaid wages in a dramatic show of unity by refusing to contest the opening moments of their  Segunda B match at the weekend.

After the referee blew the whistle for the start of the game Cartagena’s strikers played the ball forward the bare minimum before walking back to their half to join their team-mates.

The home side’s starting XI stood arm in arm and faced their fans in a line while the modest crowd at Cartagonova Stadium stood in unison and applauded.

Lucena, whose plight is largely in parallel with their opponents, dropped to their knees and put their arms behind their backs in their own form of protest.

Almost 40 seconds passed before a Cartagena player got the match proper under way and it became business as usual in their fight for survival. 

A 71st-minute strike from former Real Madrid youth player Chus Hevia decided the 1-0 result for the home side but their sides' statement was made long before that.

Play recommenced with almost 40 seconds of the first half passing by with Cartagena eventual 1-0 winners

Players from both clubs haven’t been paid for several months by their relatively new investment company owners and are clearly reaching the end of their tether.

Lucena was taken over in summer 2014 by a group of investors led by Eduardo Bouzon while Cartagena was acquired by the company Sporto Man Gol 2020.
