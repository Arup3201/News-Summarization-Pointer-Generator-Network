The lead singer of the band believed to be responsible for causing the nightclub fire that killed 234 people in Brazil was arrested as he attended the wake of his bandmate today.

Marcelo Santos of the Gurizada Fandangueuira band, was arrested by police at the Santa Maria municipal gymnasium during a collective wake among the coffins of the 234 dead.

He was paying his respects to his former accordion player Danilo Jacques who had escaped Saturday morning's fire at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, but raced back in to rescue his accordion and died.

One of the Kiss club's owners, Elissandro Spohr, was also arrested, along with one of the band's entourage Luciano Bonilha.

The second co-owner of the club has given himself into police, a spokesman said.

Mauro Hoffman arrived at a police station in the city accompanied by a 
lawyer at 2.30pm today after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

Police have five days to interview Mr Hoffman and Mr Spohr, who 
was arrested this morning and is under police guard in hospital, where 
he is being treated for smoke inhalation.

A posting on the band's Facebook page today read: 'If the regrettable lost of our friends, fans, and Danilo is not enough, now they have arrested Marcelo de Jesus dos Santos and Luciano Gf. All because they want to find an easy way out, to patch things up, while with the authorities (big fish) nothing happens (sic).'

Gurizada Fandangueira is a band well known for its onstage pyrotechnics show and it is believed that their Sputnik machine used to create sparks set alight to the club ceiling's foam insulation.

Guitarist Rodrigo Martins told Radio 
Gaucha that the band started playing at 2.15am 
'and we had played around five songs when I looked up and noticed the 
roof was burning'.

'It 
might have happened because of the Sputnik, the machine we use to create
 a luminous effect with sparks. It's harmless, we never had any trouble 
with it,' he said.

'When the fire started, a guard passed us a fire extinguisher, the singer tried to use it but it wasn't working.'

It comes as a survivor of the Santa Maria nightclub fire has told how he saw people hiding inside freezers in a desperate attempt to escape the flames and toxic smoke.

Personal trainer Ezequiel Real posted details of his escape from the burning Kiss nightclub on his Facebook page.

He wrote: 'I saw the start of the fire which came from the sparks from the flares and spread though the sponge sound proofing on the ceiling.

'I didn't freak out because I thought I could handle the situation, but I saw a lot of people panicking, passing out and falling over each other.

He said he saw 'a lot of desperate people' running for the closest door "which was that of the bathroom, and they hid inside. I saw people who worked at the club even hiding inside the freezers.

'When I saw there were no way I could get out of the main entrance, I went round through the VIP area and out the side, pushing and stepping over a lot of people. I was stepping on the bodies of women and men who had fallen down or passed out.

'I didn't hear any fire alarm sounding, only screams. I didn't see any emergency exit signs lit up, just smoke.

'When I got out, my mind was full of the people that I'd stepped over to get out and I went back to take them out because I couldn't stand to hear their screams, or see the police and firefighters unable to get them out because there were so many people piled up on top of each other.'

Ezequiel said that after a hole had been opened in the wall he climbed back inside to help a firefighter save more people.

He wrote: 'I went in and for the first time saw death personally.

'The first time I turned on the torch and focused on the VIP area, I saw many bodies, I didn't know what to do any more, I lost strength because I could see people hanging from the railings, I saw people piled up on top of each other, and it wasn't one or two dozen, it was a lot of people.

Police are looking for co-owner Mauro Hoffman following the fire at his nightclub Kiss

'It's an image I will never be able to erase from my mind. I had no more physical strength to stay there and I had to leave defeated back through that hole.'

Meanwhile, police said a computer which would have contained the CCTV images taken from inside and outside the club has disappeared.

Police chief Sandro Meinerz said the club's co-owner Elissandro Sphor, who was in the club at the time of the tragedy, denies taking the equipment.

The club's other co-owner, Mauro Hoffman, is now considered a fugitive of justice.

The party was organised by students 
from several academic departments from the Federal University of Santa 
Maria. Such organised university parties are common throughout Brazil.

Some reports claimed desperate revellers had mistaken the toilet signs for those for the emergency exit.

Santa Maria's military police chief Edi Garcia said he had taken more than 180 bodies from inside the toilets.

He said: 'The scene was terrible, so said to see. There were so many young people, and the space was very small.

Most victims died from smoke 
inhalation rather than burns in what appeared to be the world's 
deadliest nightclub fire in more than a decade.

One
 of the owners of the club is reported to have confirmed that they were 
in the process of renewing its licence to operate, and that its fire 
safety certificate had expired last year.

Emergency services say they feared at least 20 more bodies remained inside the building, and hundreds of others were injured

He is said to have received threats on the internet - as have surviving members of Gurizada Fandangueira.

Around 100 victims of the fatal nightclub blaze in Santa Maria, southern Brazil, are to be buried today, according to reports.

The city's Ecumenical Cemetery opened at 7.30am and will be conducting burials every half an hour, staff confirmed.
