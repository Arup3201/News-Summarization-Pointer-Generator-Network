A video shows the terrifying moment a champion paraglider plunges to his death after his parachute spun out of control and sent him plummeting to the ground.

Five times Russian champion and married dad of two, Alexey Miheev, 38, was in the village of Karagailnsk in Eastern Russia's Kemerovo region practising some new tricks when the tragedy struck.

Horrified local man Ruslan Repin, 34, said: 'I was with my young son who's only 10 when we spotted the parachutist.

'He was really enjoying watching him because he said it was like a human bird so I decided to start filming it on my mobile.

'When he first started spinning I thought it was part of his routine.

'But as he got closer to the ground I realised something had gone wrong.

'And then the body hit the ground. It was pretty shocking and not something my son should have seen.'

Alexey was at a height of just over 1,000ft - which was not high enough for him to be able to get out of the spin

Fellow paraglider Eduard Zakharov said: 'He had gone there to try out some new moves and the day before he managed 10 spins without any problems.

'The next day though, when he went into the spin, he was just over 1,000ft which isn't high enough to get out of the spin.

'Impact from that height is fatal.'

Experts say that Miheev may lost consciousness after the 4th or 5th spin.

A police spokesman said: 'We are looking into what caused the pilot to lose control and whether there was a fault with the parachute or with his health, or both.'

The moment was captured on video by an onlooker who had been filming the champion paraglider practising
