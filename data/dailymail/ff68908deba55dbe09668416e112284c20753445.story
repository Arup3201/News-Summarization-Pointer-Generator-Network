Sayeed Warsi said Christians were often 'scapegoated' for events that take place thousands of miles away

Britain's most senior Muslim politician, Sayeeda Warsi, has warned that the persecution of Christians has become ‘a global crisis’.

Minister for Faith Baroness Warsi described ‘a rising tide’ in attacks on Christians in the war-torn regions of Egypt, Iraq and Syria where they often become ‘scapegoats’ for events taking place thousands of miles away.

Warsi, a mother of five and the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, pointed out that Christian minorities are threatened by Muslim majorities in the very places that gave rise to Christianity.

In an open letter to L’Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper, she wrote: ‘The bitterest irony of this persecution - ostracism, discrimination, abuse, forced conversion, torture and even murder - is that it is taking place in a region where Christianity has its roots.

‘Sometimes these cases are examples of collective punishment: people lashing out at Christian minorities in response to events happening many miles away.

'Other times, a Christian is just a convenient ‘other’ - a scapegoat.’

‘The threat to religious freedom, I believe, has become a global crisis.’

The number of Christians killed for their faith around the world doubled in 2013. The senior Tory said that majority Muslim communities have a duty to defend Christian minorities.

She said: ‘History teaches us that we have only defeated intolerance and hatred when we have all come together, whatever the cause. The majority communities need to defend the minorities.’

The peer, who is also a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister of State, said that ‘the government has elevated (religious discrimination against Christians and other minorities) to a key priority in the government’s human rights work.’

An estimated 100 million Christians around the world suffered persecution for their faith in 2013.

Failing states with civil wars or persistent tensions such Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen were often the most dangerous for Christians.

There was now ‘a strong drive to purge Christianity from Somalia’, a report by non-denominational group Open Doors USA who compiled a list of the worst countries said.

The majority of anti-Christian persecution in the world in 2013 took place at the hands of radical Muslims, according to the report, both in Islamic countries such as Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Maldives, Pakistan, Iran and Yemen and in non-Muslim countries such as Kenya and Tanzania.

In Syria, 1213 Christians were killed last year, more than the global total in 2012. Atrocities against the Christian minority who make up 10 per cent of the population have been getting more frequent since the war began almost three years ago, perpetrated especially by jihadi groups.

In Pakistan– a suicide bombing at a Peshawar church last autumn killed 89 in the country’s deadliest single attack targeting Christians so far.

There is also increasing violence against Christians in Africa. 612 Christians were killed for their faith in Nigeria last year.

Elsewhere, Sri Lanka saw more than 50 attacks on churches last year alone, powered by a strident Buddhist nationalist movement

Killings are only the most extreme examples of persecutions. Christians, the world’s largest persecuted minority also face attacks on churches and schools, discrimination, threats, sexual assaults and expulsion from countries.
