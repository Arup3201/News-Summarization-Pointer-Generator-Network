Referee Bobby Madden defended  his decision on Friday night to start a snowbound Rangers-Hearts clash abandoned after 25 minutes.

With the game the subject of a pre-match pitch inspection – while loud protests against the Rangers board took place outside – the Govan area was blasted by heavy snow an hour before kick-off.

Acting on the advice of groundstaff, however, Madden decided to go ahead with the game in farcical conditions.

Loudly booed by a crowd of less than 20,000 when he called a halt to proceedings, the referee defended himself afterwards, insisting: ‘It was the right decision (to start). The fans were inside the ground. I made the final decision based on player safety. The information was it (the snow) was forecast to come back on.

‘There was a potential risk of injury. When you see the players running at 100 per cent, you see they are struggling. It was the best decision to start the game and see what happened.

‘When we arrived at the stadium we felt it was acceptable.

‘We were led to believe through the groundstaff that the snow would not come back – which it didn’t – and that the snow would melt once the players were on the field of play and through the undersoil heating.

‘Unfortunately, after starting the match, it didn’t seem to improve. So the decision was taken to postpone the match.

‘Both coaches were concerned for the safety of their players and I took that into consideration because that is of paramount importance.

‘I spoke to both coaches on different occasions before we took the final decision.’

Hearts boss Robbie Neilson appealed to the official to call a halt to proceedings before he did so on safety grounds.

Concerned that players might have suffered an injury, the Tynecastle manager defended Madden’s decision, saying: ‘I think Bobby made the right call at the start – you never know with snow as it can break up and melt and we could have had a decent game.

‘But tonight it just turned to ice. It was soft underneath and then hard on the top and it becomes a shambles.

‘Players were missing the ball and others were falling over it, but the real worry is that someone gets injured.

‘Alim (Ozturk) took a bad one on his shin with a 50-50 tackle when both players missed the ball. I think the ref made the right decision in the end. I feel we had to give it a go, we took the chance and it didn’t work out.’

Rangers announced later that fans who retain their ticket stubs will now gain free entry to the rearranged fixture, with a date still to be set.

Expressing sympathy for the supporters robbed of the chance to see the game to completion, Rangers caretaker manager Kenny McDowall said: ‘It’s expensive enough to go and see football in a normal situation but to get it cut short is not ideal.’
