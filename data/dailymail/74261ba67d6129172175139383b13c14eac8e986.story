Almost a quarter of boys in state schools are classed as having special educational needs, official figures reveal.

Nearly a fifth of all pupils are considered to have problems including learning difficulties, speech and language needs or a form of autism, the data shows, with twice as many boys as girls affected.

However, the results were met with incredulity by some education experts yesterday. Two years ago a damning Ofsted report said 450,000 children had been labelled SEN to cover up poor teaching.

Schools can also claim extra funds if pupils are classed as having certain types of educational needs.

And it is taken into account when assessing exam results – thus boosting a school’s standing in league tables.

Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, who has been a headteacher in the state and private sectors, said: ‘It’s become an industry that has grown over the past 20 years at a rate that is impossible to believe. In my view, a lot of it is to do with children not getting good teaching.

‘One of the criteria for classifying children as SEN is they can’t read when they get to seven or eight. That is often because of the way they have been taught.

‘It also attracts extra funding, so it is a way of boosting a school’s budget.’

A local authority makes a statement of special educational needs if it decides that the child’s needs cannot be provided from within the school’s resources.

These resources can include money, staff time and special equipment.

The Department for Education figures found 1.5million children at all schools were classed as SEN in January. This is actually down slightly on last year, when the figure was 1.6 million.

Separate Government data published last 
week found pupils with a statement of special educational needs are 
about eight times more likely to be expelled and six times more likely 
to be suspended at least once.

Pupils with SEN, but no statement, are 11 times more likely to be permanently excluded and five times more likely to get one or more suspensions.

The Ofsted report unearthed a ‘culture of excuses’ in some schools which meant pupils making slow progress were classed as SEN.

Some parents were also found to be lobbying for positive diagnoses so that their children would receive extra support, such as tuition and extra time in exams.

The report said the term special educational needs ‘is used too widely’ with many schools using low attainment and relatively slow progress as their principal indicators.

‘Inspectors saw schools that identified pupils as having special needs when, in fact, their needs were no different from most other pupils,’ it said.

All schools’ funding includes an element to support children with SEN. But if the SEN costs per pupil are more than £6,000, the local authority helps with the additional costs.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘We are reforming the special educational needs system so that children and their parents have more say and greater control over the support they receive.

‘Our reforms will improve outcomes for pupils with SEN by providing better information for families, greater integration of vital services and one system for children and young people with SEN from birth to 25.’
