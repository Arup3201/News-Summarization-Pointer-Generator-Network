It's not unusual for visitors to Las Vegas to end up in an embarrassing situation - but the plight of one British tourist became much worse after his drunken antics were uploaded to YouTube.

The young Liverpudlian was found by police wandering around the Strip wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and in need of a helping hand to find his hotel room.

Unfortunately for the man, who gave his name only as 'Steven', the officers were being filmed for an American reality show named Vegas Strip, which airs on cable network TruTV.

Busted: Police have been filmed apprehending a drunk Liverpudlian tourist on the Las Vegas Strip

Confused: The man, named Steven, was evidently having difficulty getting back to his hotel room

In the clip, which has had around 75,000 hits since being uploaded to YouTube, the over-excited tourist is shown being approached by two local cops as he tries to get back to his hotel.

He is shirtless, wearing only a pale blue pair of shorts with sunglasses and trainers.

The friendly officers ask him, 'How you doing?', and he shocks them by replying: 'Have you got some beef?'

Much of what he says is subtitled for the U.S. audience, due to his thick Scouse accent and slurred words. 

Helping hand: The Scouser was subtitled in footage which appeared on cable network TruTV

Escorted: The tourist was helped back to his hotel room but would not reveal who he was holidaying with

Steven tells the police his name, saying he is 'from a place called the UK', and adding that he has been walking through a lot of car parks.

One smiling officers asks him: 'Let me guess, you’ve been drinking?'

He replies: 'I'm sorry, I'm drunk, I am drunk. I've got no excuse. I'm trying to go home to bed.'

As he digs out his hotel room key for the police to help him home, one officer jokes: 'How long did it take you to get that Weekend at Bernie's walk down pat?'

Steven asks if the police have been following him, and when they say they have he replies: 'Nah, I was undercover, you couldn’t have spotted me. I thought I was camouflaged.'

Arrest me! The man asked to be handcuffed because he said he 'doesn't like surprises'

Friendly: The police assured Steven he had done nothing wrong and shook his hand as they departed

When a hotel employee emerges to help take him back to his room, the officers ask who he is on holiday with so they can look up his room number.

However, he responds: 'I'm sorry sir, I'm not willing to give that name. Out of respect for my friends, I can't give them in.'

They assure him that 'no one's in trouble', but the confused tourist says: 'I've seen documentaries and these jails scare me, Las Vegas jails scare me.'

When the hotel confirms his room number, the police try to send him on his way - but he refuses to believe that they will not arrest him.

He holds out his arms to be handcuffed, saying: 'I'd rather give you my hands than you pounce on me. I don't like surprises.'

Instead, the officers shake hands with him and insist that he go back to his room to sleep it off.

One of the policemen then tells the camera: 'He was enjoying Vegas - maybe a little bit too much.'
