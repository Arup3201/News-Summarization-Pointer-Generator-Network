It has been another difficult week for Liverpool. A last-minute equaliser conceded in the Merseyside derby followed by a Champions League defeat to Basle has put the club in the spotlight.

Since losing in St Jakob-Park, players have been questioned and Brendan Rodgers has been scrutinised, as have Liverpool’s dealings in the transfer window just gone. Amid all that gloom, though, is one shining light: Raheem Sterling.

So on Friday morning, when I saw the back page of this newspaper, I was sent into a rage. A headline reading ‘Kop fight to keep Sterling’ was not what was needed before a game of huge significance for Liverpool.

Do not underestimate the importance of the showdown with West Brom. If Liverpool fail to win again, the international break will be an absolute nightmare and the mood will worsen.

Now, before we go any further, I want to make it clear I have no issue about a journalist unearthing a story. Nor, on a separate matter, do I have a problem with agents trying to get the best possible deal for their clients. In both circumstances, people are just doing their respective jobs.

The reason for my fury was the timing of this particular story. Whoever has let it be known that Sterling is in no rush to commit his future to Liverpool has made a massive mistake. No thought has been given to the big picture.

If anyone around me had put out a story like that about me during my career, never mind the day before a game, our relationship would have been over. My agent, certainly, wouldn’t have done anything like that and I would never have allowed that, even if he had wanted to.

No matter what your job, we all like to see our wages increased but in the 18 years I played for Liverpool, I never put pressure on them or went asking for a new contract, as the club were renowned for rewarding those who made progress quicker than anticipated. They still do it now. Daniel Sturridge’s new deal  is evidence of that.

I regularly signed four-year deals that were ripped up within 18 months, either by Peter Robinson — Liverpool’s fabled former chief executive — or his successor Rick Parry, when the club felt my performances had improved. That was the way it was done.

Had I found myself central to a story like that, I would have been mortified having to face my manager, so how would Sterling have felt on Friday morning when he walked into Melwood and saw Rodgers before training?

What particularly frustrates is that it isn’t the first time we’ve seen stories about Sterling — who has been linked with Real Madrid — and his contract. He is one of Europe’s finest young players, a star in the making, but he is old enough to have his own voice and put a stop to things like this happening.

Whoever believes it is a good idea to put pressure on Liverpool has failed to understand the emotion of fans. There is never a good time for these stories to appear but when your team is losing, the last thing you want to read about is potential problems for your star player. It also creates a perception that a player is more interested in money than football, which in turn creates an image. Part of an agent’s duty, after all, is to portray his client in the best light whenever he can.

They have also not grasped just what Liverpool have done for Sterling since he signed as a 15-year-old in 2010. He and his family have been looked after; Rodgers, meanwhile, has protected and nurtured him, providing him with the platform to showcase his talents.

Young players should concentrate on playing games, not get distracted by what is going on off the pitch. That is why it was heartening to see another young star across Stanley Park sign a new contract in the summer without any fuss, how it should be done.

Ross Barkley, who is only 20, may have been linked with Manchester City recently but he has committed to Everton and he should not be giving any thought to leaving Goodison Park until after the next World Cup in 2018. That message would also apply to Sterling.

If, in the future, both players feel they want to try a new adventure, it should be when they are 24 or 25 and a team will be formed around them. If they were to leave too early, they would simply become pieces in a jigsaw rather than the main building block.

Sterling and Barkley are the two most exciting young players in England and now is the time for them to repay the clubs that have given them such fantastic opportunities and will continue to guarantee them regular starts.

Continue as they have been and Liverpool and Everton will have no hesitation about paying them what they are worth. Indeed, Brendan Rodgers has said that it is only a matter of time before Liverpool ‘reward’ Sterling, who has three years remaining on his current deal.

This, to be clear, is not a criticism of the money these young players are being paid — I was on the receiving end of such comments from old pros when I was starting out — and I appreciate we all maximise what we can earn.

There are, though, ways and means of doing things. The best is behind closed doors.

This week I'm looking forward to: Watching Danny Welbeck take another test

The game of the weekend is at Stamford Bridge and you can be certain that both John Terry and Gary Cahill will know they have been in a battle. When Danny Welbeck moved to Arsenal from Manchester United on transfer-deadline day, I thought it was a good signing but not necessarily one that would take them to the title. It looked more like a buy that was made with the future in mind.

Welbeck, however, was outstanding in the Champions League win over Galatasaray and the good news for Arsenal supporters is that Arsene Wenger has a track record in nurturing promising young forwards into world-class front men. The evidence is provided by Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie.

To look at Welbeck’s physical attributes, he ticks all the boxes. He has power and pace, a relentless work-rate and he is the type of forward who will never give a defender a moment’s rest. He will be at Terry and Cahill from the start. What he needs to show now, though, is that he has composure in front of goal. Wednesday night was a positive step.

His finishing was impressive but holding your nerve when Terry and Cahill are trying to hunt you down is different. Another big performance, though, and Welbeck will be moving in the right direction.

Here’s to game's Marvellous characters 

It was a treat last week to sit and watch the fittingly named BBC Two drama Marvellous about a man called Neil Baldwin.

He was, among other things, Stoke’s kit man under Lou Macari and, if you have not had the chance to see it, I would strongly recommend that you try and view it on catch-up TV. It provides a reminder to all football fans that there is more to clubs than just the players.

Characters like Neil Baldwin make clubs what they are. Since I retired, I have been asked numerous times about what I miss most. The first answer, of course, is running out every week at Anfield and winning big games for Liverpool.

The story of Stoke kitman Neil Baldwin (right), played by Toby Jones, is a tremendous tale

A close second, though, is not seeing people behind the scenes at Melwood every day: Kenny and ‘Big Jimmy’ on the gate, Anne who worked on reception, Graham, our kit man, and Paul Small the masseur. You see these people every day and then, in a flash, it stops.

Every club will have people who work away from the spotlight and get no public credit, but they help create the atmosphere and are worth their weight in gold. That’s why it was enjoyable to see Neil Baldwin get that recognition.
