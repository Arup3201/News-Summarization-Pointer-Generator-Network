Unbeaten UFC champion Ronda Rousey's foray from the Octagon into action films has received rave reviews from Hollywood co-stars including Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.

The UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion has followed up her appearance in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 with a butt-kicking role in the latest Fast and Furious installment.

A behind-the-scenes preview shows the 28-year-old American trading some serious blows with actress Rodriguez in what producer Neal H Moritz described as 'one of the best fights we've ever had in the franchise'.

Rousey referred to the clash between the two women wearing expensive gowns in a penthouse suite as 'like a super oestrogen-pumped fight scene and I I can't wait to see the shock factor.'

Her celebrity co-stars were equally impressed by the first US woman to win an Olympic gold medal in Judo, at the 2008 Beijing Games.

'I think the Ronda Rousey aspect is the game changer,' said Rodriguez - who finished filming the scene with a high-five congratulations following Rousey's knockout blow.

Leading man Vin Diesel claims he always knew Rousey would have 'a very special moment'

'I just love Ronda Rousey and I knew she was going to have a very special moment,' added leading man Diesel. 

Rousey currently boasts an 11-0 record in the sport having defeated Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds in her most recent contest on February 28.

However, she recently quashed talk of the prospect of her ever fighting a male opponent in UFC.

'There should never (be) a venue where we're celebrating a man hitting a woman,' she said.
