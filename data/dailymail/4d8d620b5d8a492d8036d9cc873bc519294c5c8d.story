It's loved on the high street for its purse-friendly fashion but would you pop into Primark for a quick eyebrow wax or manicure?

The cheap and chic store has launched Love Beauty Brow & Nail Studio, affordable beauty studios opening in selected Primark stores in the UK and Ireland.

But don't expect to come away with smudged nails or wonky eyebrows because the woman behind the new budget beauty studios has tended to the A-list.

Get the look: Beauty studios are gradually being introduced to Primarks across the UK, so will it give you brows like Cara Delevingne? The new boss thinks so. Monika Mohindra is the brains behind the new brand and she previously worked with her sister, brow-guru Shavata Singh, who tends to Elle Macpherson, right

Monika Mohindra previously worked with her  sister, brow-guru Shavata Singh, who shot to fame after a Vogue editor gushed about the amazing facelift-like effect of her brow shaping.

Shavata tends to the eyebrows of Elle Macpherson, Lily Allen and Kelly Brook at her Knightsbridge salon, which Monika helped her build up.

Using her expertise, Monika has established Love Beauty, which she says will be the go-to for brow, lash and nail services for the savvy, cost-conscious customer. 

Budget beauty: The menu includes professional £5 brow shaping and threading, as well as £5 tinting services, classic and quick fix treatments such as luxury and mini manicures and lash extensions

Get arty: There's also a nail art service, which offers a choice of 500 nail stamps, pictured

The menu includes professional £5 brow shaping and threading, as well as £5 tinting services, classic and quick fix treatments such as luxury and mini manicures (£5), and lash extensions.

You can get semi-permanent lash treatment where bespoke lashes are created to suit your eyes or go two-tone - single strand lashes which go from black at the bottom to a bold colour on the tips. 

There's also one-step £25 gel manicures, which can be removed at home using take-away gel soak off sachets, plus nail art services offering a choice of 500  nail stamps.

The salons, which are currently housed in Manchester, Liverpool and Dublin (as of this weekend), tie in with the store's Love Beauty product line launching later in 2015.
