Found: Police sergeant Neale Coy lives in the Goole area of East Yorkshire

A police sergeant who sparked a missing person appeal after he failed to turn up for work has been found safe and well, Humberside Police said today.

Neale Coy, 50, who lives in the Goole area of East Yorkshire and failed to attend for his shift last night, was found in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire.

Earlier today, colleagues said the disappearance was 'totally out of character' for the officer, who has more than 27 years of service.

Sergeant Coy had failed to turn up for his shift last night and had not been seen by friends or family since.

A Humberside Police spokesman said: 'Mr Coy came forward at Scunthorpe General Hospital today and will now be supported by the force.'

Police launched an appeal to trace their colleague earlier today, saying they were 'worried about his welfare'.

A concerned Rich Kerman, a senior Humberside Police officer who works with Sgt Coy, had said: 'I have known Neale for over 20 years and it is totally out of character for him to simply not show up for a shift.

'Neale, if you are watching this on the news, hear it on the radio or see it either online or in a newspaper, please get in touch either with your family or by calling in and speaking to the force duty officer to let us know you are OK and look at coming to meet you.

'If something is troubling you then you shouldn't be looking to face it alone and we can help.'

Officers raised the alarm after Mr Coy, who has more than 27 years of service, did not show up for work, Humberside Police said.

Police refused to comment any further.
