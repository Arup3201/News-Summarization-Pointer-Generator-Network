A pill to prevent jet lag may be in sight after scientists discovered the gene that causes the condition.

The gene, Lhx1, controls waking and sleeping patterns and could also help control dementia, sleep disorders and help shift workers, researchers claim.

Every cell in the body has a 'clock' - an abundance of proteins that dip or rise rhythmically over approximately 24 hours.

Scientists have discovered the gene that causes the jet lag, paving the way for a pill to treat it

The
 master clock responsible for establishing these rhythms and keeping all
 the body’s cells in sync is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

This is a small,
 densely packed region of about 20,000 neurons housed in the brain’s 
hypothalamus.

And these neurons are in close and constant communication with one another, more so than other areas of the brain, say the Californian authors of the new study.

The close interaction, combined with exposure to 
light and darkness through vision circuits, keeps this master clock in 
sync and allows people to stay on essentially the same schedule every 
day.

However this tight coupling of the cells also helps make them collectively 
resistant to change.

Exposure to light that resets less than half of the SCN cells, resulting in long periods of jet lag.

In the new study, researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies disrupted the light-dark cycles in mice.

Using the mouse-version of jet lag - an 8-hour shift in their day-night cycle - 
the scientists found that those with little or no Lhx1 readjusted much 
faster to the shift in pattern than normal mice.

This suggests that because these neurons are less in 
sync with one another, they are more easily able to shift to a new 
schedule, though it is difficult for them to maintain that schedule.

The gene, Lhx1, controls waking and sleeping patterns and could also help control dementia and sleep disorders and

Researchers also found that these mice also exhibited reduced activity of certain genes, including one that creates vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) a molecule that has important roles in development and as a hormone in the intestine and blood.

In the brain, Vip affects cell communication, but nobody had known that Lhx1 regulated it until now, said study author Professor 
Satchidananda Panda

The team also found that adding Vip restored cell synchrony in the master clock responsible for establishing these rhythms and keeping all
 the body’s cells in sync.

Prof Panda added: 'This approach helped us to close that knowledge gap and show that Vip is a very important protein, at least for the suprachiasmatic nucleus. It can compensate for the loss of Lhx1.'

Cutting back on the peptitde could also be another way to treat jet lag.

In fact, it could be an even easier drug target compared with Lhx1, because Vip is secreted from cells rather than inside cells, Professor Panda said.

He added: 'If we find a drug that will block the Vip receptor or somehow break down Vip, then maybe that will help us reset the clock much faster.'

Such treatments could also help people suffering from dementia - thought to be made worse by sleep problems.

'It’s possible that the severity of many dementias 
comes from sleep disturbances,' explained Professor Panda.

'If we can restore normal sleep, we can address half of the problem.'
