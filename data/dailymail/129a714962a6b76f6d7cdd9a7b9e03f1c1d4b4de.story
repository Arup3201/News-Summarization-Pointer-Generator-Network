Australian trainer Peter Moody says he is devastated he faces a three-year ban following a positive drug test on one of his horses.

Moody, responsible for guiding the brilliant Black Caviar to 25 straight wins, was told that Lidari, second at the Spring Carnival at Flemington last October, had tested positive for elevated cobalt levels.

The four-times champion trainer, who recently reached 100 winners for the 12th season running, has vowed to clear his name, insisting: ‘I have no knowledge or understanding as to how this could occur and will work with the Racing Victoria Integrity Services Department to bring this matter to a conclusion as soon as possible.

‘I am devastated to be informed by Racing Victoria that one of my runners has tested positive for a banned substance.’

Victoria stewards have been robust in their bid to stamp out cobalt chloride, a performance-enhancing substance which can produce a similar effect to banned blood booster EPO.

‘We have had the drug’s presence (in Lidari) confirmed by labs in Western Australia and Hong Kong,’ said chief steward Terry Bailey.

There has been been plenty of friction between Racing Victoria and Moody, with the latter claiming last April that he was being persecuted by the state ruling body.

‘I feel they are looking at me as a cheat; that really riles me,’ blasted Moody, who reacted angrily to Racing Victoria’s request to have keys for each trainer’s stables in their jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, Chepstow is waterlogged and Friday’s meeting is subject to an 8am inspection on Wednesday.
