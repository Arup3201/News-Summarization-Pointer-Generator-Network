Passengers aboard a JetBlue flight have told of their terror as they narrowly avoided a mid-air collision with a small private plane that was 'joyriding' in commercial air space. 

One witness said she heard a 'whoosh' from the cabin of JetBlue Flight 94 as the small plane passed narrowly beneath the the Airbus A320 as it was coming into a landing at Westchester County Airport north of New York City on Sunday. 

Passengers credit the extreme evasive maneuver that quick-thinking pilots pulled after cockpit collision alarms sounded, WABC-TV reports. 

AJetBlue flight from Orlando to Westchester County, New York, could have ended in disaster had the quick-thinking JetBlue pilots not gone into an extreme maneuver to avoid a mid-air collision

'If they didn't move our plane that way, where our wing was up... I think it would have hit us,' Megan Sikorski told the TV station. 

'It was going to hit us. They don't maneuver planes like that if they're not trying to get out of the way of something...(the pilots) saved out lives, no doubt.'

The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the harrowing near-miss - though nobody seem to know where the private plane came from - or who was flying it. 

Ms Sikorski said she heard the pilots - who were nearly as shaken as the passengers - say that the private plane was 'joyriding' in commercial airspace.
