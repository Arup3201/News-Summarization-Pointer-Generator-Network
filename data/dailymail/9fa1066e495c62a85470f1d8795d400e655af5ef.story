War usually conjures up images of bloodshed, violence and death.

Rarely do we see the softer side of the life on the front line - and these stirring images give a glimpse of soldiers chatting with children, cleaning their weapons and caring for their animals.

The remarkable pictures in the annual Army Photographic Competition show Britain's soldiers at work and play.

Corporal Jamie Peters, RLC, won the top prize for his portfolio of images from six months in Afghanistan, where he was deployed as the photographer for the Army's Combat Camera Team (CCT).

Combat Camera Team I was able to see so much of the work that British 
troops do in Afghanistan from patrols and operations in Helmand to the 
Officer Academy in Kabul.

'I think it is a unique job to travel so much around the country and see so much of our soldiers.

'Everywhere we went there was a story to tell, from the experiences of the private soldiers right to the HQ level of planning and executing the missions.'

Sergeant Harlen, who has worked as a professional Army photographer for eight years, said: 'The opportunities in London are different from the rest of the Army, but the challenge and skills are the same.

'I learnt on operations that you can't photograph a bullet but you can capture the human reactions, to try to tell the whole story in one image.

'In my current job there's just as much pressure to capture that split second moment, whether it's the ceremony of official engagements or capturing the bond between a cavalryman and his horse.'

Other winning photos feature boxing matches, horses being exercised and soldiers on duty.

The pictures are now on display at the National Army Museum in Chelsea.

Broadcaster Dan Snow, who is honorary colonel of the Army's media operations group and opened the display, said: 'These professional and amateur pictures capture elements of Army life that we just don't see otherwise, and it's a reminder that excellence on operations is not only about the frontline, but also about the individual, the bond between soldiers, the training and hard work, and also the lighter side of life.'
