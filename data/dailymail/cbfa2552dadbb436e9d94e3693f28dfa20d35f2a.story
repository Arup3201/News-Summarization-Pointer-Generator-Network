Many people like to eat eggs for breakfast - whether they be fried, boiled, scrambled or poached.

But few would be able to recall ever cooking one with a tail.

This bizarre egg - featuring a 3cm-long tail - was discovered at a house in Lingen, northern China.

Strange: The unusual accessory might make the egg less appealing to eat, but also makes it easier to crack

Laid by a hen, it is slightly larger than the average egg - and also has a small, twisted tail.

But while its odd accessory might make it less appealing to eat, it also has one advantage - it makes the egg far easier to crack.Â 

The misshapen food was found by a villager known as Mr Lu at his home in Liyuan village in Shanxi province, which situated along the banks of the Fen River.

Mr Lu, who keeps several hens at his house, said he had never seen such a strange egg before - but did not say whether he would be sampling the oddity.

While is not uncommon for birds to produce oddly-shaped eggs, experts cannot agree what causes other animals, such as hens, to lay eggs with tails.

However, some
 suspect the fowl could produce such a bizarre creation as a result of stress.

It is not the first time a Chinese hen has popped out such an unusual egg.

In May 2012, a hen in Hukou seemingly forgot the rules of nature by laying an egg with a fatty inch-long tail.

The egg itself was a little smaller than normal, but its oddity meant it measured a lofty 8.5cm in length.

And, according to China News, a 'spoon-shaped' egg was laid by a hen in Huaibei City in China's Anhui province in January 2005.
