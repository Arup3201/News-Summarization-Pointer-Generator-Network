An 'average-looking' doll, complete with acne and stretch marks, has gone on sale this morning after a successful crowdfunding campaign.

Artist Nickolay Lamm, 26, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, created 'Lammily' based on government measurements of an average 19-year-old American woman, wanting to offer an alternative to Barbie and other fashion dolls that perpetuate outrageously unrealistic beauty standards.

'I think a realistic sized doll is important because, when I look at current dolls on the market, I can’t help but notice how disproportionate they are,' Mr Lamm told Salon.

Realistic: Lammily, an 'average-looking' doll that features stick-on cellulite, stretch marks and other imperfections, went on sale this morning

The 11-inch doll, now available on Lammily.com for $25, comes dressed in an ombre denim shirt, shorts and white sneakers. A variety of stylish ensembles, all inspired by cosmopolitan cities such as New York, London and Paris, are sold separately.

But her most unusual accessory is a $6 packet of Lammily Marks - a selection of 38 reusable stickers that resemble acne, cellulite, freckles, moles, stitches, scrapes, bruises, mosquito bites and other imperfections.

After Mr Lamm launched a crowdfunding campaign in March, 13,621 backers pre-ordered more than 19,000 dolls totaling $501,384.

Each model features average proportions of a typical 19-year-old girl (32-31-33), a light amount of make-up and bendy joints.

If the dolls are a success, he plans to extend the range to 'embrace diversity, from race to body type.'

In his research, Mr Lamm found that, scaled up to human size, Barbie dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33. 

What's more, while the average 19-year-old is a modest 5ft 4" tall, Barbie would have a supermodel stature and would be a relatively lofty 5ft 8".

Thanks to her ultra-slender measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would weigh about 110lbs and would have a BMI of 16.24. This would fit the weight criteria for anorexia, as a healthy BMI range is between 18.5 and 24.9.

Mr Lamm's hope is to promote a more positive body image to children.

'I wanted to show that average is beautiful. Rather than waiting for change to happen, let's be the change,' he says in a YouTube video for his crowdfunding campaign.

He concludes: '[It's] so that our girls can grow up to become happier, stronger women, truly confident and proud in their own bodies.'

Mr Lamm consulted with Robert Rambeau, former vice president of manufacturing at Mattel, for advice on finding a suitable manufacturer to produce his Lammily line.

While the production process took months to figure out, Mr Lamm said the biggest challenge will be getting children to go for something new.

Attempts at average-sized dolls in the past have not been successful, he says, but he believes that's because the 'average size' message wasn't appealing to kids.

'It would be like me trying to feed them broccoli,' he joked to Fast Company. Instead the entrepreneur wants children to see 'a cool-looking doll' and he will not push the 'average-looking' message too hard.

In demand: After Mr Lamm launched a crowdfunding campaign in March, 13,621 backers pre-ordered more than 19,000 dolls

The public appear to be supportive of Mr Lamm's empowering goal.

'Awe this is awesome. [The Lammily doll] looks just like me! Thank you for making me feel beautiful!' one commenter said.

And another added: 'Thank God someone finally created an "average Barbie" ... I love it! I hope by the time i have kids myself Lammily will have taken over the market.'
