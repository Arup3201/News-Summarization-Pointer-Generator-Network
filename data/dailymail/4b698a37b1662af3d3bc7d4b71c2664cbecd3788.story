The Great Barrier Reef, a vast maze of coral nooks and crannies, is not the best place to drop your wedding ring.

And what with all those sea urchins, lion fish and moray eels lurking in the rocks, its probably not a good idea to go poking around too diligently.

But Eirian Evans, along with new bride Bethan, begged their instructors to help them search the reef after his ring slipped off his finger during a honeymoon diving expedition.

British honeymooner Eirian Evans lost his wedding ring while snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef with wife Bethan. The ring was found in the coral after the couple returned home and has now been returned to their home in Cardiff

After several hours, they gave up and the couple returned to the UK thinking the silver band was lost forever.  

But just a few days later, the couple, both 29, received an email from the diving company telling them the ring had been found.

Miraculously, a sightseer on the same 
expedition as theirs spotted the ring glinting on a piece of coral and 
handed it to staff at the Ocean Free diving school – not knowing what 
joy his find would bring.

Mr Evans, a credit card claims handler
from Cardiff, said: ‘I’m not used to wearing rings so I had been 
playing with it non-stop since our wedding day.

‘I got out of the sea and went to fiddle with it and realised it had gone.

‘The honeymoon to Australia was the trip of a lifetime.

‘Coming back without the ring was 
heartbreaking but getting it back like this is the icing on the cake.’ 
The wedding band arrived safely in the post last week.

Taryn Agiun, co-owner of the Ocean 
Free school, said: ‘It’s truly amazing the ring survived, especially 
because fish often eat shiny or sparkly objects mistakenly for food.

‘We all got tingles when we found out it was a wedding ring and could belong to someone who had gone on one of our tours.

‘It’s a beautiful omen to their marriage, which I think shows they are meant to be together forever.’
