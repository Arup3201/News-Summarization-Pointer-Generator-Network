Shay Given has labelled Scottish fans hypocrites for slating Irish imports Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy when Gordon Strachan’s squad contains English-born stars.

The 38-year-old goalkeeper, capped 126 times by the Republic, has been angered by the barbs aimed at the Glasgow-raised pair in the build-up to Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier.

He took particular aim at Scotland legend Gordon McQueen, who has called for the Tartan Army to give the Everton duo a ‘horrible reception’ at Celtic Park.

Given insists double standards are at play and questioned whether McCarthy and McGeady playing for the land of their grandparents is any different to the Anglos at Gordon Strachan’s disposal.

Four players in the pool to face Ireland — James Morrison, Russell Martin, Chris Martin and Matt Gilks — were born south of the border, although it’s fair to say that none of that quartet actually turned down England in favour of Scotland.

Regardless, Given was unhappy at the treatment of his team-mates, saying: ‘I felt the comments were out of order over the past couple of days. They were a bit unfair as some of the Scottish players were born in England but have Scottish parents and that.

‘It can’t be one rule for Ireland and one rule for others. They are in the exact same situation, so some of the comments were a bit personal and a wee bit over the top.’

Asked if he was referring to McQueen, Given replied: ‘That’s who I mean, yeah.’

James McCarthy is a major injury doubt for Friday’s Euro 2016 showdown at Celtic Park

He added: ‘I just think there is no need to go to that sort of level. As I say, they have players in their squad as well who weren’t born in Scotland and playing for them.

‘They are the rules and every country is the same. I think it was unfair on James and Aiden to single them out.

‘You could go round every country in Europe and say there are players born in different countries.

‘But they are great players and that’s probably why we are standing here talking about them, because they [the Scots] probably wish they were playing for Scotland.’

Strachan has suggested fans can boo McGeady and McCarthy – who is an injury doubt with a hamstring problem – as long as it’s ‘pantomime humour’.

Ireland manager Martin O’Neill was reluctant to be drawn too far into the debate but was puzzled by his counterpart’s stance.

‘I’m not really sure I share Gordon’s view,’ he said. ‘I’ve been in the game a long time but I’ve never heard of gentle booing in my life.

‘I suppose no amount of pleading on the other side is going to prevent anything that might occur. James and Aiden are very fine players and I think they will be okay.’

O’Neill, meanwhile, is willing to give McCarthy until the last minute to prove his fitness for Friday night’s game.

‘We’ll play it day by day with James,’ said O’Neill. ‘It’s only less than 48 hours since he had a strain and we’ll see how he is

‘He’s played a lot of games as Everton are also involved heavily in the Europa League. I think it’s one of those situations where you really would have to wait until the last minute.’

Striker Kevin Doyle was ruled out Ireland yesterday but O’Neill is hopeful Burnley left-back Stephen Ward will be available.
