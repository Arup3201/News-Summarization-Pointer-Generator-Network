Dangerous? Two studies claim more than one fizzy drink a day increases the risk of diabetes and hypertension

Just two fizzy drinks a day can damage the kidneys, research shows.

One study revealed how the type of sugar used in such drinks apparently raises blood salt levels.

A second showed that the drinks may cause the kidneys to get rid of too much protein from the body.

A hallmark of failing kidneys is called proteinuria – the increased excretion of protein in the urine.

It was found in those who had two of the drinks daily in a study at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan.

More than 8000 university employees with regular kidneys took part in the experiment.

A third abstained from fizzy drinks, another third drank one a day, and the final group had two a day.

In a space of just three days, 10.7 per cent of the third group developed proteinuria, and 8.9 per cent of the second group showed similar effects.

The first group just showed signs in 8.4 per cent of those tested.

Fructose or fruit sugar is used to sweeten soft drinks and researchers for the second study at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland found that it increases the kidneys’ sensitivity to angiotensin II, a protein that regulates salt balance.

It means salt is reabsorbed into the kidneys, which could lead to diabetes, obesity, kidney failure, or hypertension.

Researchers hailed the tests, on rats, as a potential indication of what is causing epidemics of these illnesses.

Both studies were presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week in Atlanta last week.
