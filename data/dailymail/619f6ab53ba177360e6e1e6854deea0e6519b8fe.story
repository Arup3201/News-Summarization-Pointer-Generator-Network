The Sydney teenager who speared the skull of Liam Knight with a metal pole has been sentenced to at least eight years.

Liam was one of about 70 guests celebrating the 18th birthday of his friend Harry Staples in Forestville in Sydney's north in January last year when things went horribly wrong.

The then 16-year-old known as DS gatecrashed the party with four other young men only to be told they were not on the guest list, and unwelcome.

Extreme harm: Liam Knight, pictured leaving Downing Centre Court following the sentencing of his attacker, suffered an 'extreme' degree of harm in the 'catastrophic' steel pole assault in January last year, said Judge Ronald Solomon, which left Knight with permanent injuries and his future life 'in tatters'

Plans shattered: Liam Knight, pictured leavibng the Downing Centre Court on Friday afternoon, told the court last month in a pre-sentencing hearing that the metal pole attack by the teenager known as DS, 'changed my whole life. For the simple fact that he could not get into a party, my life as it was before the injury is gone. I nearly lost my life numerous times that night. The future I had planned has gone

DS then scaled a high fence at the home and climbed onto the roof of a shed, shouting to his mates, 'come on, we can come through this way'.

Harry Staples' father, Phillip Staples, shone a torch on DS and said: 'Mate, you're not invited, you have to leave.'

Angry and intoxicated, pushed Mr Staples in the chest, and punched one of the party guests in the face. Then he began throwing building materials at partygoers.

One of four steel three-metre rebars that he threw into the crowd pierced Liam's skull and lodged in his head.

Paramedics arrived on the scene and sedated Knight, but had to wait for firefighters to cut the large piece of steel protruding from his head, before they took the young man to hospital.

In Royal North Shore Hospital, Knight underwent a five hour emergency bilateral craniectomy.

Long sentence: The teenager who threw a three metre metal pole into a party crowd in January last year, piercing the skull of Liam Knight(pictured, left) and leaving him with permanent injuries has received a minimum eight year sentence for his crime

Angry and intoxicated: The teenager, then aged 16 years, arrived at party in Forestville in Sydney's north in January last year where Liam Knight was one of about 70 guests celebrating the 18th birthday of Harry Staples  when things went horribly wrong.
The teen, known as DS, gatecrashed the party and scaled a high fence at the home and climbed onto the roof of a shed. Then he threw four three-metre bars into the crowd, piercing Liam's skull

Last month, the court heard the attack had left Knight's life 'in tatters'.

In sentencing DS to a maximum of 12 years and six months over the attack on Friday, acting Judge Ronald Solomon told Sydney's District Court that the consequences for Liam were 'catastrophic'.

The pole pierced Knight's skull and came out the other side, leaving him with permanent brain injuries that he said would prevent him from surfing, playing rugby and perhaps even running again.

'The degree of violence perpetrated by the offender was high and the degree of harm extreme,' Judge Solomon said.

'DS has changed my whole life for the simple fact that he couldn't get into a party,' Liam told the court during DS's sentence hearing in June.

'My family should never have heard the words "your child has been seriously injured and may not live",' Liam said in a victim impact statement read by his brother to the court on Friday.

'I nearly lost my life numerous times that night.

'DS changed my whole life. For the simple fact that he could not get into a party. My life as it was before the injury is gone. The future I had planned has gone.'
