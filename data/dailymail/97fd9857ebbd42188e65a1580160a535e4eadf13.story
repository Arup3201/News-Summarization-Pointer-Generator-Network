The lesbian ex-partner of a multi-millionaire property developer has launched a court battle seeking a larger share of her lover's fortune - even through the wealthy tycoon died more than a year ago.

Businesswoman Carol Ainscow told her civil partner Helen Roocroft that her fortune had been reduced to £750,000 at the time their relationship fell apart.

But after Ms Ainscow died of a brain tumour in 2013, Ms Roocroft discovered that she was apparently worth around £6million thanks to her investment in Manchester's gay village.

Ms Roocroft, 40, now claims she was misled by her ex during their break-up, and says she is entitled to a payout much bigger than the £162,000 she accepted as part of a settlement.

The case which reached the Court of Appeal this week is unique - not only is it believed to be the first lesbian 'divorce' ever to be heard in the court, it is the first time a dead person has been retrospectively accused of hiding assets.

The two women, both from Bolton, were together for 19 years after starting a relationship in the early 1990s, the court was told.

During this time Ms Ainscow became a leading property developer in Manchester's Canal Street district, as well as opening a bar in Soho, central London.

She built a massive fortune through her business empire, and was named on the Sunday Times rich list for the North with an estimated value of £30million, the court heard.

Ms Ainscow and Ms Roocroft entered into a civil partnership in 2008, but they separated the next year and their legal partnership was dissolved in August 2010.

Ms Roocroft applied for financial maintenance after the break-up, and was told that Ms Ainscow's business had been seriously affected by the recession, leaving her with just £750,000 in assets.

Seeking a 'clean break', Ms Roocroft accepted a settlement of £162,000, to be paid in instalments.

When Ms Ainscow died of a brain tumour in September 2013 at the age of 55, her ex-partner realised that she was in fact much wealthier than previously thought, the court was told.

Business accounts for the year ending 2010 showed that Artisan Holdings, a property company wholly owned by Ms Ainscow, had a net worth of £5.5million.

Ms Roocroft's lawyer Samantha Hillas said: 'If Ms Ainscow had made full disclosure, it is inconceivable that the court would have approved an award in such modest terms to a wife in such modest circumstances.'

Last year, a county court judge denied Ms Roocroft permission to re-open her claim against Ms Ainscow's estate, but that decision was overturned by Lady Justice Black.

'There was material to support the case that there was non-disclosure of potential significance to an ancillary relief claim,' said the judge.

'It was Ms Ainscow's duty to make full and fair disclosure, not only so Ms Roocroft could evaluate her claim and decide upon how to proceed with it, but also so the court could exercise its discretion.

'Ms Ainscow had denied that Ms Roocroft's understanding of her financial position was correct. The judge must have proceeded on the basis that she had much more modest means than Ms Roocroft thought.'

She added: 'It is surely arguable that there is a public interest in not supporting those who mislead others, in particular the court. I am persuaded that the grounds of appeal, as drafted, have a real prospect of success.'

Pointing to the case's unusual circumstance, Lady Justice Black said: 'The complication of the death of Ms Ainscow is significant. I'm not aware of any similar case where the non-disclosure has been acted upon following death of the other party.'

Ms Hillas said Miss Roocroft's appeal was likely to be 'bitterly contested' by the representatives of Ms Ainscow's estate, which was inherited by her mother because she died without making a will.
