She's already been censored by the Motion Picture Association of America for a poster advertising the upcoming Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and now Eva Green's appearance in a trailer for the same film has been deemed too risque for ABC.

The problem is a sheer white nightgown the sultry French actress is wearing in the poster and trailer, which ABC says makes Green 'appear to be naked.'

For the MPAA, the 'curve of under breast' proved too much for the American public.

Trailer: ABC won't air the trailer until two scenes featuring Green in a white robe have been removed

The organization argued that the almost-visible nipple and the outline of Green's naked breast amounted to nudity.

The filmmakers compromised and the poster, featuring Green wearing a sheer white robe with a pistol in her hand, has been modified so that the gown is less transparent.

ABC, a source told Page Six, rejected the trailer for the film, which also stars Josh Brolin and Jessica Alba, because Green appears to be naked in the gown.

The filmmakers were told to remove the footage of Green in the white robe if they want the network to air the trailer.

By contrast, action films' advertising regularly features the movie's star aiming a gun or committing an act of violence.

Green seems bemused by the reaction the sexy poster has provoked.

'You have so many more violent things in the movie business ... this is kind of soft. I’m not naked. It’s suggested. I find [it] really sexy,' she told vanity Fair.

In 2011, the Los Angeles Times named the former Bond girl number 18 on their 50 Most Beautiful Women in Film list.

In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked her Number 2 on its list of 'the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish women in the world.'
