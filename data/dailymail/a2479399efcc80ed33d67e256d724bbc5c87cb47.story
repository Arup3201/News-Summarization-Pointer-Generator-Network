A girl is suing one of America's largest indoor water parks after she lost part of her thumb in a wall vent.

Serenity C. Davis was swimming in Schlitterbahn Water Park in Galveston with her family when her hand got sucked into the vent in the wave pool.

As the next wave came, her body was dragged in one direction and her trapped hand in the other, a lawsuit filed in Galvestonâ€™s District Court claimed.

Her age is not stated in the papers but her lawyer Daniel D. Horowitz said she is under 13.

Painful: Serenity C. Davis was swimming in Schlitterbahn Water Park in Galveston with her family when her hand got sucked into the vent in the wave pool

Her screams for help were answered by other swimmers who rushed to her aid.

However, when the finally managed to prize her hand free from the vent, part of her thumb down to the knuckle was missing, the lawsuit said.

One of the swimmers who came to help held her hand above the water to try and stop the bleeding.

Serenity was placed in wheelchair, and pressure was applied to her thumb until additional medical treatment was available, the lawsuit claims.

No. 1 in America: According to its website Schlitterbahn has 'uphill water coasters, water slides, kid's playgrounds, whitewater rapids, wave pool, hot tubs, plus the Boogie Bahn surf ride'

The lawsuit, seen by the Galveston Daily News, accuses the waterpark of negligence in creating a condition that posed an unreasonable risk of harm.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages to cover medical expenses, pain and suffering, disfigurement and physical impairment.

A Schlitterbahn waterpark spokesman had no comment on the allegations, but he said safety is a top priority for the water park.

According to its website, Schlitterbahn Water Park in Galveston is the 'World's Number One water park in the US' and features 'uphill water coasters, water slides, kid's playgrounds, whitewater rapids, wave pool, hot tubs, plus the Boogie Bahn surf ride'.

During the summer it offers 'more than 32 family-friendly attractions'.
