The wife of murdered Australian businessmen Robert Kelvin Ellis has told Indonesian police she played no part in his killing, blaming her housemaids and local thugs in Bali.

Robert Ellis' body was found by a farmer in a ditch in a rice field on Tuesday, wrapped in plastic and bedding, 25 kms from the couple's luxury Bali villa.

Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis, has told police she slept through the murder in a guest room of the home, next door to the kitchen where three attempts were made to slit her husband's throat, Fairfax reports.

According to police, Robert Ellis was set upon  by five killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig.' The autopsy has confirmed he died from a 'deep cut to the throat'.

'The cut severed an artery - blood would have spurted and it would have been a quick death after that. The victim didn't show much sign of a struggle, and there were no signs that he was defending himself. We saw bruising on both arms indicating that he was restrained,' Dr Ida Bagus Putu Alit from Denpasar's Sanglah Hospital told Fairfax.

Police allege Ms Noor had admitted ordering the hit on her husband, paying the couple's two housemaids and  five men 150 million rupiah ($14,200) to carry it out. But her lawyer says she only organised some men to 'talk' to her husband about financial problems and things went wrong. 

If found guilty of premeditated murder, Ms Noor faces the death penalty in Indonesia.

Police allege Noor Ellis paid Arli (also known as Adrianus Ngongo or Ariel pictured), the boyfriend of her maid known as 'F', $14,000 to kill Mr Ellis

According to her lawyer Nyoman Wisnu Yasa, Ms Noor had asked her maids to organise some men to give her husband a 'talking to' because he was withholding money from her. 

'Noor said specifically and several times: "Do not harm Bob, do not injure him in any way"', the lawyer told Fairfax Media.

She claims she only knew her husband  was dead when she was awoken by a knock on her door and a thug saying: 'Ibu [Ma'am], the job is done.'

Ms Noor told Police she found her husband in blood on the kitchen floor and was forced to get rid of the body.

'She was only following instructions. She was saying, "I don't want this," but the executioners were saying, "You do it or we'll kill you too". She had no idea where to go, it was them telling her, "Go straight, go left, go right,"until they reached the middle of nowhere and dumped the body,' reported her lawyer.

But Police allege Ms Noor organised the murder of her husband of 25 years because she was furious over money and infidelity. They say she and the two housemaids had already confessed. 

'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp. 'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her.' 

Police allege she paid one of the maid's boyfriends, Arli (also known as Adreanus Ngongo or Ariel) and other men $14,000 to kill Mr Ellis, most of it to be paid after the crime. 

Police spokesman Hery Wiyanto said Ms Noor, Arli, maid 'F' and a second maid known as 'Y' will be charged. F is accused of 'lifting and dumping' Mr Ellis' body, while Y apparently cleaned up the bloody kitchen.

Mr Wiyanto said two charges were being weighed - murder, carrying up to 15 years jail, and premeditated murder - which carries a maximum penalty of death.

Arli  is now in custody but police are looking for four other men, identified as Martin, Deni, Angel and Urga who they believe were involved in the killing.

'Some have fled out of Bali and some are still hiding in Bali,' said Wiyanyto. 'We urge them to surrender. Wherever they are, we will hunt them down.'

Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife

The couple's sons Jon and Peter Ellis, both Perth-based students, arrived in Bali on Thursday.

They released a statement on Wednesday saying their father was a huge influence in their lives. They were 'completely devastated' by his death, they said.

'The circumstances surrounding the death of our father is something we are still trying to come to terms with at this moment.'

'We are fortunately surrounded by friends and family.'

'We do ask for people to understand our need for privacy at this extremely difficult and sad time for us.' 

Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis, who had been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife. 

A friend told Fairfax Media that Mr Ellis spent a lot of his time in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, where he had an apartment.

'He used to go up there every week and was rooting every girl that runs around town,' the friend  told Fairfax.

Although Mr Ellis's wife has reportedly confessed to ordering her husband's murder, he is said to have angered contractors who were building a motel for him in the Bali beach side town of Sanur, claiming they were not doing a good job.

He was accused by the friend of being very tight with money.

Bali police said Mr Ellis' was found with his hands and feet tied, and a bed cover had been put over his body. A mobile phone and a large mat was found in close proximity to the body, local authorities said.

'There is no doubt this was an execution-style murder,' said a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar. 

'One of the wounds to the throat was fatal, but he also had several bruises around his head, suggesting he had been knocked to the ground before receiving the fatal throat wound,' said Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who heads the district's forensic team. 

The body Mr Ellis, 60, was found in a rice field on Tuesday morning local time by residents

Detective Wisnu Wardana said the body is believed to have been lying in the ditch for several days as it was in a state of decay.

The rice paddy where the body was found lies between the popular coastal area of Kuta and the hillside town of Ubud.

'There was a deep wound to the neck that had almost completely cut the head,' said Detective Wisnu. 

Police believe the mat found in the ditch was used to wrap the body and carry it to the rice paddy to be dumped.

It is understood Mr Ellis went missing in the early hours of last Sunday morning.

There were bruises around his mouth and his right cheek, as well as on both his upper arms, suggesting he had been restrained.

It is understood that Mr Ellis and his wife had been living in the Emerald Villas, a luxury complex in the Balinese seaside district of Sanur.
