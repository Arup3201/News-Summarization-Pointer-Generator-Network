Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro has wasted no time in accepting her Ice Bucket nomination as she joined the worldwide phenomenon in aid of ALS.

Didier Drogba nominated Carneiro for the challenge, with the latter taking it on with minimum fuss.

In a short video posted on her YouTube she went on to pick Branislav Ivanovic as one of her nominations, telling him to stop being a chicken and get some ice over his head.

She also pledged her support to Macmillan Cancer before doing the challenge, which like ALS is an organisation where she has had first-hand experience of overseeing the work they do.

The Ice Bucket Challenge phenomenon continues to go viral on social media worldwide with the ultimate aim of raising awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease.

As well as Carneiro a number of other people connected to the west London side have undertaken the challenge, including the likes of Drogba, Cesc Fabregas, skipper John Terry, and manager Jose Mourinho.
