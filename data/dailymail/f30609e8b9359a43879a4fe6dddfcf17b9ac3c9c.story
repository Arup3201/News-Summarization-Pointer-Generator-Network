Mafia boss Dominco Rancadore, who spent 20 years evading Italian authorities, has been told he will not be released on bail

A fugitive Mafia boss who spent 20 years on the run from Italian police has been told he will not be released on bail despite having a heart condition.

Domenico Rancadore, also known as 'The Professor' was arrested in London after evading Italian authorities for two decades.

The High Court today overturned a decision to grant the 64-year-old bail, with Lord Justice Goldring saying there was a risk he might abscond.

Rancadore had been granted bail at a hearing on Monday, but was ordered to remain in custody following an immediate appeal by prosecutors.

The appeal hearing was delayed yesterday after judges heard that Rancadore had been taken to hospital with heart problems.

Today Lord Justice Goldring, sitting at London’s High Court with Mr Justice Ouseley, said it was clear that Rancadore had a heart problem and it was something which should be kept in mind.

However, the judge said there was 'a real risk - indeed a very real risk - that he would abscond if granted bail'.

Lord Justice Goldring added: 'In my view this appeal should be allowed and Mr Rancadore remanded in custody.'

Rancadore is wanted in Italy to serve a seven-year jail term for his role as 'a man of honour' in the Sicilian Mafia, also known as Cosa Nostra, collecting bribes from builders in Trabia, near Palermo.

He was found guilty of being part of the gang between December 1987 and April 1995, and in 1999 was convicted of Mafia 
association and exortion in his absence.

Italian prosecutors claim that he 
received around £3,500 in bribe money, and 'ensured strict compliance 
with the rules of the organisation', Westminster Magistrates' Court has previously heard.

He came to 
live in the UK with his family in 1994, and has never returned to Italy.

Chief magistrate Howard Riddle granted him bail at the Westminster court on Monday, but he was not released after prosecutor Hannah Hinton said there would be an appeal.

Rancadore was arrested on August 8 at his upmarket semi-detached home in Uxbridge, west London, where he lived under the false name Marc Skinner with his wife Anne, 64, and children Daniela, now 33, and Giuseppe, 36.

The family moved to London after two acquittals for Mafia activity in 1987, saying he wanted to 'get away' from their surname, which is infamous in Italy as Rancadore's father was a feared Cosa Nostra boss.

The court had heard that Rancadore told officers upon his arrest that he was not going back to Italy because 'they will kill me'.

The conditions of bail set out by the chief magistrate included £50,000 security, residency at his home, a curfew, reporting to a police station twice daily, providing his phone number, keeping his mobile switched on and not applying for foreign travel documents.

The court has previously heard that Rancadore was a leader in a murderous gang that 'spread terror in Sicily'.

Rancadore was acquitted of previous Mafia charges in 1993 after spending months in custody and more than two years under house arrest.

Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct.

Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection.

Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere).

Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges.

It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money.

Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections.

The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy.
