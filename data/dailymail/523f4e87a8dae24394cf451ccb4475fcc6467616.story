Karim Benzema has opened up at his relationship with former Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, as he admits that criticism spurred him on to become a much better footballer.

The Frenchman signed for the Spanish giants from Lyon in 2009 and was joined at the club by the 'Special One' a year later - with the two of them failing to see eye to eye from the get go.

Benzema had felt hard done by Mourinho's scathing comments - where he was labelled as lazy - but admits that it helped him develop into the player he is today.

He told Al Jazeera Sport: 'I have had criticism ever since I signed for Real Madrid. 

'I really think it is something that has happened since I came to Real where I cannot make a bad pass or have a bad game.

'At the start, it hurt me, but I am used to it now. It affects my family more. I knew that I was being criticised, that Mourinho criticised me, but it was his way of making me react.

The Chelsea boss labelled the Frenchman as 'lazy' and singled him out in the media after his performances

'Actually, after that, I became mad. I worked as much as I could. Now, I come in before everyone else, I have treatment, I go to the gym, and I am the last to leave after training.'

While Mourinho had a successful tenure in terms of trophies and halting Barcelona's dominance in Spain, he was also involved in a number of spats with some of their stars.

Public fall outs with Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas all but ended his time at the Bernabeu before he returned to England to manage Chelsea once again.
