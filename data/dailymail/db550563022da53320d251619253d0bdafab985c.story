Chelsea Under-21 forward Alex Kiwomya will spend the next month on loan at Barnsley while teammate John Swift is heading to Swindon on loan.

Kiwomya is an England Under-19 international and the loan sees him return to his native Yorkshire. 

It is the first loan spell for the pacy 18-year-old Kiwomya who mostly operates as a winger but can play as a central striker.

John Swift has also left Chelsea on a loan deal with the midfielder joining Swindon until the end of the season

Since joining in 2010 he has won two FA Youth Cups and last season’s Under-21 league title.

Swift, 19, had a loan spell with Rotherham United earlier in the season and will join Swindon for the rest of the season. 

An attacking midfielder, he was rewarded for his form when Jose Mourinho handed him his first team debut away at Cardiff on the final day of last season.
