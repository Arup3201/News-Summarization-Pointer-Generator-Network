English rugby is experiencing a major culture shock this season – Saracens are in danger of becoming lovable. 

The north London club have been successful in recent years, but they haven’t been market leaders in winning hearts and minds.

In fact, they have been adept at getting under the skin of opponents, rival supporters and neutrals alike.

Talent: Andy Farrell was a coach at Saracens before England managed to convince him to join their staff

There has been a perception issue. They 
have been derided for being a South African out-post, for a rigid 
tactical approach and for seemingly antagonistic antics – from a grating
 anthem at home to away-day ambush stunts. They have attracted grumbles 
about squad size and what is seen as a defiant, us-against-the-world 
mind-set.

Yet, there are increasing reasons why this team who have been respected, sometimes feared, but not widely liked and admired, deserve more credit these days.

They will go to Toulouse on Sunday for a seismic Heineken Cup showdown as standard-bearers for the Aviva Premiership, with a real chance of winning and progressing to the knock-out stages. Their quest should generate widespread support from these shores, due to their transformation.

This season, Saracens have become a pleasure to watch. They have already scored almost as many league tries as they did in the entire 2012-13 campaign, after instigating a fundamental change in approach, to great effect. They are off-loading, creating space and running amok.

Altered strategy is not the sole reason for greater admiration. Despite the South African links, they are contributing heavily to England’s cause – with a multitude of players in the national squads.

The RFU wanted Andy Farrell, Saracens released him, and eventually lost him. Now Paul Gustard is being seconded to the union, as a rising defence guru. The club’s boot-room culture is creating a generation of accomplished, home-grown coaches.

This is also a club with down-to-earth values behind all the stellar names and financial clout. There is a commitment to hard graft and a band-of-brothers unity – epitomised last Saturday at Gloucester as they stood their ground when reduced to 13 men, and celebrated each mini triumph with gusto.

Yet, alongside the core culture, there is also ambition and innovation. Saracens have a world view and they finally have a worthy home too, complete with a state-of-the-art artificial surface. They worked hard to convince the local community in Barnet that this could be an asset to be shared. Now they are going some way to convincing the wider rugby public that they deserve to be loved.

Flourishing: England's Alex Goode has been picked in the England squad again

France coach Philippe Saint-Andre is in buoyant mood ahead of his side’s Six Nations opener against England in Paris. The reason for his positivity is the improved access to his players, with a new agreement meaning they are available for training two weeks prior to the championship.

They will first gather near Perpignan, to benefit from good weather before relocating to their regular base; Marcoussis, near Paris. France have their four-yearly chance to benefit from the aftermath of a Lions tour by dominating the Six Nations, but they have been a mess in recent times.

As ever, Saint-Andre has an array of talented players at his disposal, typified by the centres in his squad; Wesley Fofana, Mathieu Bastareaud, Maxime Mermoz and young Toulouse sensation, Gael Fickou.

More access: Philippe Saint-Andre will now be able to train his team for a fortnight before the Six Nations

But the coach cannot fall into the modern trap of assuming more access automatically ensures more success. With the clock ticking in the countdown to the World Cup, it is time for Saint-Andre to prove his worth at Test level. A major excuse for failure has been removed. France must deliver.

Bristol clearly mean business. Having already established a hard-hitting management team led by director of rugby Andy Robinson, supported by head coach Sean Holley, the West Country club are now seeking to build a pedigree squad.

The signings of ex-Wales and Lions scrum half, Dwayne Peel, and Bath’s imposing Samoan prop, Anthony Perenise, indicate growing ambitions and financial backing to support the drive to return to the Premiership.

This column remains resolutely neutral, of course, but welcomes the prospect of a traditional power-house of the English game reclaiming a place among the elite. Bristol is a hot-bed of rugby with a strong, thriving league structure in the city and surrounding area. It is an area that deserves a top team to follow.

There has been much amusement in recent days after the IRB declared – mid-season, with the Six Nations approaching – that the new scrum engagement process was being adjusted yet again.

The decision has been made to do away with the referee’s call of ‘yes nine’, to clear the scrum half to feed the ball in. Instead, officials will make a signal or gesture.

Cue endless tongue-in-cheek suggestions about what that might entail; a wink or a cough being among the more sensible ones put forward.

On the one hand, the move is a sensible tweak to remove an audible alert to the pack challenging the put-in, so that the team in possession have a fighting chance to withstand the eight-man shove. But the renewed tinkering and the somewhat comical nature of this amendment does not show the game in a particularly positive light.

Alterations: The scrum rules are going to be changed another time by the IRB

Former England Sevens coach Ben Ryan, now in charge of Fiji, has not been ‘paid a penny’ since taking charge of the Pacific-island nation’s team at the start of the season.

Despite making a positive impression and overseeing victory in the Dubai Sevens tournament, Ryan has been relying on his own savings to fulfil his role. The Fijian Rugby Union insist that he agreed to serve the first three months of his contract on a ‘voluntary’ basis and if that is the case, he deserves considerable credit for a selfless gesture.

The FRU are seeking government funding to start paying Ryan’s salary but ideally the IRB should intervene. While the world governing body are investing in the Pacific islands, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga remain poor but hugely important rugby countries and more help is needed.

Selfless: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan has not received a salary for the first three months of his time in charge

There are growing indications that the sport has reached a global tipping point. News has emerged from Australia that the Wallabies’ captain, Ben Mowen, has opted to sign a lucrative deal with Montpellier, rather than play for his country at the next World Cup.

Shortly afterwards, it was announced that New Zealand wing Zac Guildford has agreed to join Clermont Auvergne, instead of pursuing his Test ambitions.

Piles of Euros are threatening the primacy of international rugby. Increasingly, players who are young and ambitious, or in their prime, are rejecting the lure of national service in order to gain financial stability and a change of lifestyle.

Right choice? Ben Mowen has chosen Montpellier's money over playing for Australia in the next World Cup

This situation has been hampering Tier Two countries for many years, but it is now becoming a problem for leading nations too. No-one should begrudge an individual the right to maximise their earnings, but the fluid worldwide transfer market is in danger of diluting the standard of the international game.

It would be a shame if rugby rapidly went the way of football, with clubs dominant and countries a mere after-thought.
