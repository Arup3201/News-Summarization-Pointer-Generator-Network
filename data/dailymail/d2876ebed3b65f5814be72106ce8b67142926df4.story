A brave 18-year-old man has braved the jaws of a tiger shark to film video of it eating a beached whale off the coast of New South Wales.

Michael James waded in knee deep into the ocean at Broulee - on the state's south coast - to shoot the footage.

Residents who had gathered in crowds at the beach told Channel Seven's Sunrise at least four sharks were seen feeding on the whale.

Despite the danger Mr James waded in knee deep into the ocean at Broulee to shoot the footage

In Mr James' footage, a shark can be seen circling the carcass before it dives down to take a bite out of the carcass, which was caught on rocks on the beach.

At one heart stopping moment, the teenager loses his footing - slipping on seaweed - while he is up-close and personal with the predator.

'It took a bit of guts to get in there and have a crack at it,' Mr James told Weekend Sunrise.

'My girlfriend's right into her footage, I thought I'd get this for her and she'll be happy.'

But Mr James was not the only one curious about the whale and the sharks.

One resident had come down to the beach with his daughter to check out all the action.

The man's child barred him from taking a dip but it did not stop them from spectating along with tens of others.

A local Broulee resident and his daughter were some of the crowd that gathered to watch the sharks feeding 

'The shark would come and chomp on the whale, swim away 20 minutes later roughly and come back and chomp on it again go digest it, come back. It was quite amazing,' he said.

Shark experts closed off the beach until the sharks had dispersed.

They said it was common for sharks to feed off a carcass as they were known as the 'garbage cleaners of the sea'. 

After first circling around, the sharks dive down to bite off pieces of the dead whale
