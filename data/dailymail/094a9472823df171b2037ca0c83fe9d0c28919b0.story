Wealthy professionals in the medical industry, including surgeons and hospital executives have been caught out using a tax loophole to pay for lavish personal items. 

Rich hospital workers,  businessmen and charity leaders are using the tax break to pay for high-end holidays, extravagant meals and even their children's weddings.

The meal and entertainment concession allows employees to spend an uncapped amount of money on food, entertainment and leasing facilities, with some members paying for cruise tickets using the privilege.

The concessions, or credit cards as they are known, allow employees of certain salary packages to purchase items such as mortgage repayments or vehicle expenses from pre-tax income, thereby reducing income tax payable.

The federal government has come under pressure from some not-for-profit agencies, who say the state could save astronomical amounts of money over the coming years if they were to get rid of the concessions. 

According to a report submitted by Save The Children Australia, the exemption from fringe benefits  is estimated to cost the Treasury up to $600 million a year over the next few years.

Treasury has estimated that it will cost over $2 billion in lost tax over the next four years.

'The Productivity Commission has provided examples of how $2,200 restaurant meals and $40,000 weddings could be paid for from pre-tax income to avoid significant amounts of tax that would otherwise be payable on the relevant employee’s income,' the Save The Children Australia report said. 

'The benefit of this concession is also not evenly spread among NFP(not-for-profit) employees, tending to be more highly utilised by eligible employees on higher salaries.' 

Although Save the Children  currently benefit from this concession, they told Daily Mail Australia that they support its removal.

They hope the funding will be re-directed to support vulnerable children. 

The concession was initially offered up to not-for-profit organisations as an incentive for new employees however over the years it has become a loophole for the rich to enjoy an extravagant lifestyle.

Speaking to The Australian Financial Review, World Vision Australia chief executive Tim Costello said he believes lower paid workers are shunned in the fringe benefit concession, allowing the rich to take a large chunk of the benefits. 

'The concessions enable huge benefits to the richest 1 per cent working in the sector while offering minimum benefits to the lowest paid sector.'

According to a Treasury report, the concession will cost  $465 million this year alone in lost tax and that figure will rise by nearly $100,000 by 2018.
