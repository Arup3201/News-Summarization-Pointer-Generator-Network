Profits at controversial payday lender Wonga more than halved last year as the company embarked on a drive to clean up the image of the business, it was revealed today.

Wonga said the 53 per cent slide in profits to £39.7million in 2013 was in part due to a one-off charge in relation to a recent scandal over fake legal letters.

These were used in order to chase struggling customers into paying up, and Wonga racked up £18.8million in costs relating to the scandal.

The company said it expects that it will be ‘smaller and less profitable’ in the near term while it builds a more sustainable business for the future.

Pay-day lender: Wonga said it expects that it will be ‘smaller and less profitable in the near term’

The firm, which has been attacked by MPs for charging interest rates of over 5,000 per cent, had been forecast to post annual profits of £50million for 2013 compared with £84.5 million in 2012.

But the slump revealed today was even worse than expected, and is reported to have also come from difficulties at its overseas and small business operations.

Wonga issued 4.6 million loans in 2013, a rise of 15 per cent, and lent a total of £1.3billion, compared with £1.19billion the previous year.

Revenues were 2 per cent higher at £314.7million but operating costs jumped 56 per cent to £133.7million. The default rate on loans fell to 7 per cent from 7.4 per cent in 2012.

Michael Ruck, a senior financial services enforcement lawyer at Pinsent Masons and formerly with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ‘Such a large drop in profits reflects both the impact of FCA regulation and also the current reputation of payday lenders.

‘Firms are in the process of finding out if they have achieved FCA authorisation. Despite the large amount of time and money invested by firms, they need to understand the standards and approach of the FCA including how to challenge the FCA.

‘Wonga and similar firms need to stop shooting themselves in the foot by doing things such as allegedly impersonating solicitors to recover monies from customers.’

In July it brought in the former chief executive of the RSA insurance group, Andy Haste, to head the group, replacing founder Errol Damelin who left earlier in the year, in a bid to clean up its battered reputation.

At the time of his appointment Mr Haste said: ‘This is a sector and Wonga is a company that needs to go through significant change if it is to have a sustainable future.

‘Some serious mistakes have been made. The company admitted those mistakes and it has apologised for those mistakes.’

Only a fifth of people struggling to repay a loan had the interest frozen and just a quarter thought the lender treated them sympathetically, a poll claimed today.

The figures from a Citizens Advice survey carried out between April and August this year also showed just one in three people thought the costs of extending a loan were made clear.

Meanwhile one in five were told of the availability of free debt advice, and half of customers said payday lenders asked them questions about their personal finances.

Gillian Guy, chief executive of CA, said: ‘Payday lenders are still not sticking to their word to treat people fairly.’

Separate analysis of CA clients with serious debt problems also found one in eight had a payday loan, and that £1,000 was the average payday loan debt.

In June Wonga was fined £2.6million for sending threatening legal letters from fake law firms to 45,000 customers by City watchdog The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

The FCA said Wonga had been guilty of ‘unfair and misleading debt collection practices’ by creating fake companies to pressure struggling customers into paying their bills.

Pay lenders have been attacked by MPs as a form of ‘legal loan sharking’.

In July the Church of England ended its indirect investment in Wonga - a holding that embarrassed the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who said he wanted to compete Wonga out of existence by boosting the use of credit unions.

The FCA is also bearing down on providers of short-term credit, proposing earlier in the summer a cap on payday lending meaning that from next January, interest and fees must not exceed 0.8 per cent per day of the amount borrowed.

It also wants to impose a cap on the overall cost of a payday loan so that it cannot exceed 100 per cent of the original sum borrowed.

Earlier this month in a bid to beef up the personnel at the payday lender Mr Haste brought in Tara Kneafsey as managing director of its UK consumer loans business. Ms Kneafsey had previously spent six years at insurer RSA.

In recent years payday loan firms - which have been attacked by MPs as a form of 'legal loan sharking’ - have been in the spotlight for crippling interest rates.

Wonga, for instance, charges 5,853 per cent in annual interest. For a £100 loan over 30 days, meanwhile, it charges £37.15.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, MPs and debt campaigners have joined the growing clamour of critics that has left such short-term lenders branded ‘legal loan sharks’.

Wonga's reputation was further damaged this summer by a fake legal letter scandal. It was revealed that the firm had been chasing struggling customers with letters from made-up legal firms to pressurise them into paying up.

Between October 2008 and November 2010, the firm sent correspondence to about 45,000 customers in arrears from non-existent law firms threatening legal action.

Annual results: Wonga's pre-tax profits were down by 53 per cent to £39.7million in 2013, compared to 2012

The case, which consumer campaigners described as a 'shocking new low' for the payday industry, also saw Wonga add charges to some customers' accounts to cover administration fees for sending the letters, from fictitious firms Chainey, D'Amato & Shannon and Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries.

The Financial Conduct Authority announced that Wonga is to pay £2.6million in compensation to the customers affected.

Part of new chairman Andy Haste’s strategy for cleaning up the firm's image was the ditching of puppets in its TV adverts and marketing to limit the risk of making its payday loans appeal to the young.

Adverts for its loans featured a group of supposedly cool and trendy pensioners Betty, Joyce and Earl in amusing situations.

But debt campaigners said the tactic made high-cost loans seem fun and normal to young people and children.

Debt charity StepChange recently said that the number of people struggling to cope with payday loan debts has risen by more than 13,000 in the past year.

It said they dealt with 43,716 people in the first six months of this year, compared with 30,762 for the same period last year.

Some people have become burdened with so much debt from payday loan firms that it has driven them to suicide.

An inquest in July heard that Ian Jordan from Botley, near Southampton, was driven to kill himself after racking up debts of more than £20,000 with at least nine payday loans companies — one of which was charging him 5,000 per cent interest.

Loans: Wonga's reputation was further damaged this summer by a fake legal letter scandal

In July the FCA announced proposals to introduce a cap on the fees and interest charged by payday lending firms in a bid to protect borrowers from escalating debts.

The proposals, which include default fees capped at £15 and a limit of 0.8 per cent per day on interest on unpaid balances, should mean those who cannot repay on time will never have to pay back more in charges than the amount borrowed.

The latest clampdown on the industry by the FCA is due to come into force in January, subject to a consultation period.
