Shelly Sterling is as racist as her husband Donald and their separation is a fake to save him from losing the LA Clippers.

That's the shocking claim of long time ex-family friend Cheryl Bogart.

According to Bogart, Shelly is Sterling’s ‘right-hand man,’ and runs his affairs ‘like a brothel.’

Earlier this week, Bogart and her brother, Phillip Scheid, revealed exclusively to MailOnline that Donald Sterling paraded around his mansions naked, threw around racist remarks to his kids and their friends, claimed Christians are stupid and beat his own son,

So far, Shelly has managed to ride on the wave of public sympathy. Former LA Clippers player Ron Harper even said: “The only bad part is I know how much his wife loves the team and mostly I feel sad for her.’

But Cheryl says that no one should have sympathy for Shelly; she’s just as bad as her husband.

The 37-year-old Cheryl, who has known Shelly all her life, says: ‘She was very well aware of the racist issues. The fact that she’s saying she wasn’t is a lie. She’s Donald’s right hand man. They’ve been married 50 years. You don’t think she’s aware of this?

'It’s a joke. She’s a liar. I don’t know why the Clippers and manager are sticking up for her, I know Shelly.

‘She’s totally a racist. When you live with someone for that long, how can you not be aware? There are court documents saying she called someone a “black motherf*****r"'

Court documents discovered by the Los Angeles Times name Shelly as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the couple by their former tenants, with one African American resident claiming that she called him a 'black motherf*****' during an argument.

Cheryl says the Clippers know that Shelly is a racist too.

‘She’s trying to come out of this whiter than white, but she’s as dirty as him. It doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

‘When they say they’ve been separated, that’s so ridiculous. The only times they’re separated is if one is at their Malibu home and the other in Beverly Hills. They’ve never been apart.

‘They’re making out like they’re separated and doing everything they can for the sake of the team and for themselves. They don’t have any plans for divorce, no way.

"After all the things that have happened to them, all the stuff she knows, all the secrets, you understand what I’m saying? There’s too much stuff they’ve done together and against people that could ever be made public. She will never divorce him.

‘One day she says my husband is racist, prejudice, and she doesn’t share those views, then the next she’s at a steakhouse with him saying: “No he’s not a racist.” That just shows her character. It’s black and white.’

Cheryl claims that Sterling even asked Cheryl’s mother, Terri, a top realtor in Beverly Hills, to lie for him during his lawsuit against mistress Alexandra Castro, whom he paid $500 a pop  to have sex with during from 1999 to 2002.

Sterling had transferred title of a Rodeo Drive property to Castro and her mother, but he sued to get it back after Castro broke off their relationship.

Cheryl, who’s writing a book on her experiences in Beverly Hills, says that the lying and suing mistresses is all part of the game for the Sterlings.

Cheryl says: ‘Alexandra Castro was one of my mom’s really best friends, Donald Sterling asked my mother to lie and perjure herself for him. Donald told her that he could make her very rich and to remember this and put it in your pocket for another day.

To legally transfer the house into the names of Alexandra Castro and her mother  they needed a realtor. They did it through Terri. Donald Sterling gave the house to Alexandra, no money changed hands apart from fees to Terri.

When Alexandra dumped Sterling, he tried to sue her and claim that she took the house from him. This was 2003 and it went to court. Sterling asked Terri to lie on his behalf and say that he didn’t give the house to Alexandra. She refused. He lost the case and ended up paying out to Alexandra.

While it was Donald Sterling who sued Castro, Cheryl explains, it was Shelly who was instrumental in him suing her. He gets caught with his pants down, lavishes gifts on his mistresses, then goes running back to his wife telling tales, then they sue whoever it is. It’s happened with Castro and with V. Stiviano.

‘They love doing this, there’s a pattern. It's like she's running a brothel and she likes it. She knows her husband is doing these things with these women, then he'll come and complain to her, then she'll sue them.

'We only know about these two, but how many others do we not know about? There could have potentially been more, but it's been buried away. They’re really, really good at making things disappear.’

Earlier this week, Cheryl and her brother, Phillip Scheid, spoke about the devastation the Sterling family had caused to their own lives.

In 2005, Cheryl was left in a wheelchair after she was drugged and fell out of a window at a party where Sterling’s son Scott was dealing drugs. Six years earlier, wayward Scott had blasted his former best friend Phillip, 34, in the back and legs 12 times with a shotgun. Scott eventually died of a drug overdose on New Year’s Day last year.

Bizarrely, even though the families have had their legal and personal battles, they’ve always remained entwined, with Cheryl’s mom Terri still speaking to Shelly.

Cheryl says that the Sterlings have been controlling her family like ‘animals locked in a cage’ for the last twenty years.

Shelly even spoke to Terri on the day that her children spoke out about their bitter experiences and tried to warn them against speaking to the press.

‘Shelly and mom talked this week. Mom had 16 reporters on her and she called Shelly, who said: “Why are they calling you? You’re not the NBA.”

Shelly said she would take care of us in the future. This is just absurd. She just always promises things and it never happens.

Deceit: Sterling allegedly asked Cheryl's mother to lie for him during his lawsuit against mistress Alexandra Castro (pictured right)

‘Mom asked her what she should do and Shelly said: “Now that is everything is out, don’t talk to the press, as they’ll investigate you.” She was trying to gag the family once again. I feel like we’ve had duct tape on our mouths, we all feel we don’t have to hide anymore. They’ve manipulated and controlled our family.

‘My mom was scared, every time she gets scared, she calls Shelly, which is the wrong thing to do. She still feels Shelly is her extended mother even though she’s done nothing for her. She’s like a wicked mother. She’s so much older than my mom, who looked up to her.

‘I’m not happy that my mom is contacting her. My mom has been manipulated by Shelly; she’s the master manipulator. She tries to make my mom feel good for the moment and, because she’s a really good person, she falls for it. She doesn’t know any other way.

‘Shelly’s so selfish and a liar. She’s been saying this stuff for years, that she’ll take care of us. She said she’d give me an apartment in Chinatown, why would you offer me this? She offered me the apartment building during the time I was suing her family for putting me in a wheelchair. I just thought it was so bizarre, it didn’t make any sense to offer this on the side.

‘We were scared. They had so much power, they made sure we kept our mouths shut, we were just like animals locked in a cage. I’m happy to be unlocked from all of this and now we can finally heal.’
