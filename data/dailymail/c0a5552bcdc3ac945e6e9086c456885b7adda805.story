Chancellor George Osborne has demanded up to £30billion of extra cuts, but senior ministers are resiting attempts to slice more from their departmental budgets

Tory and Lib Dem ministers are joining forces to oppose protecting pensioner benefits, the NHS and the aid budget from cuts.

George Osborne is under pressure to ditch David Cameron’s pledges to protect those areas in the next spending review, so the austerity can be shared more equally.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that to stop cuts from affecting schools, defence equipment, the NHS and the international development department, other departments would need to make cuts of 35 per cent.

One Lib Dem minister told the Mail the Tory decision to ringfence NHS cash is ‘unsustainable’.

And senior Conservatives have formed what has been dubbed the ‘National Union of Ministers’ to oppose further cuts in their own budgets.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond have argued cuts to the police and armed forces can go no further.

Insiders say they ‘have visibly coordinated’ their complaints in Cabinet meetings – to the irritation of Mr Osborne.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is also said to want to protect legal aid and Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has claimed the £10billion cuts demanded by Mr Osborne will lead to disaster.

Ministers are growing increasingly angry with the Chancellor’s insistence that health and education are protected, with defence and international development also cushioned from austerity.

With the budget just weeks away, ministers are also positioning ahead of negotiations this summer over the spending review for the 2015-16 financial year, which will set spending beyond the next election.

Mr Osborne is under pressure after Britain lost its AAA credit rating, amid growing backbench Tory calls for ‘real tax cuts’.

However senior Cabinet ministers are 
pushing back against demands for a fresh round of spending cuts 
totalling some £30billion, insisting savings could be found from other 
areas.

David Cameron 
promised to protect the health and aid budgets before the last election,
and both parties pledged to shield schools from cuts.

He has also vowed to protect pensioner benefits including the winter fuel allowance, bus passes and TV licences.

However,
the Lib Dems have insisted it is a policy ‘red line’ that they will not
support further cuts to the welfare budget while universal handouts for
the over-65s are untouched.

A
senior government source said: ‘The Treasury are pushing for further 
cuts and yet seem to be ringfencing more and more departments.’

Mr Cable is said to be ‘digging his heels in’ to resist any further cuts to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills which he believes is at the coalface of growth agenda.

Mr Hammond, who was Mr Osborne’s deputy before the election, is also understood to be opposed resisting further cuts to his defence budget, insisting it was underfunded under Labour.

Last week Mr Cameron suggested the foreign aid budget could be used by the MoD if it was connected to humanitarian operations.

At a Cabinet meeting today, the Prime Minister made clear to minister that there is a ‘real sense of urgency; to the need to boost economic growth.

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘There was a discussion around the importance of the Government's growth agenda, in particular looking at the work on public sector land sales, broadband, enterprise zones, deregulation, infrastructure projects.’

Ministers are also under pressure to sped up progress in implementing Local Enterprise Zones, which were set up to kickstart regional economies.

‘Progress is being made,’ the spokesman added. ‘The latest figures are about £100m private sector investment has already been attracted by Enterprise Zones.

‘What's important is that we continue with the implementation. As with all the other aspects of the Government's growth agenda, urgency is very much required.

‘The Prime Minister's view is that the Government has been doing the right thing and we need to keep up that momentum and that's what this morning's Cabinet was partly about.’
