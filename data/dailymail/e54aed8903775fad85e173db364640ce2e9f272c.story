Provocative pop diva Lady Gaga may be forced to cancel her Indonesia concert after police refused her a permit following protests by Islamic extremists.

The controversial singer who once donned a meat dress to the MTV music awards is due to play in the country's capital Jakarta on June 3 as part of her Born This Way Ball tour.

A total of 52,000 tickets have so far been sold for the gig which is the biggest show on the Asian leg of her world tour.

Anger: Protests by Islamic extremists on the streets of Indonesia have led to police refusing a permit for Lady Gaga to perform in the capital Jakarta

Gaga's outlandish and often skimpy outfits sparked criticism from both conservative politicians and Islamist extremists.

Promoter Michael Rusli had hoped police would still grant the megastar permission to perform, but spokesman Boy Rafli Amar confirmed that the application has been rejected.

Indonesia's Muslims are mostly moderate but a hardline fringe has become increasingly vocal with radical groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front and the Muslim Defender Team threatening that 'bad things might happen' if the show goes ahead.

They have suggested they will 
forcibly prevent Lady Gaga from stepping off her plane saying the 
outlandish performer will corrupt the nation's youth.

According to South East Asia Real Time Munarman, who like many Indonesians goes by just one name and is a spokesman for ultra-conservative Islamic Defenders Front, known for its staunch opposition to vice and liberalism, said: 'Lady Gaga insults all religions. Even Christians in Korea opposed her. She is promoting the worship of Satan.'

While there have been vocal street protests against Gaga making an appearance on Indonesian soil and voices of dissent from some politicians the Christian Secretary General of the Indonesian Council of Churches  today backed the international pop star.

As reported in the Jakarta Globe Gomar Gultom said sexy outfits would not lead young people into looking at pornography, rather it was down to religious guidance to ensure they have a 'clear mind and stand against temptation.

He added: 'Don’t teach our young generation with pseudo-formality by wearing good outfits but being bad on the inside.'

Lady
Gaga's recent concerts in South Korea were limited to fans 18 or older 
because conservatives raised objections and Mr Rusli has said the US pop
diva will tone down her concert for Indonesian audiences.

Sell-out: Half the the tickets for Lady Gaga's 52,000 seat concert in Indonesia sold out within two hours

On Monday an additional 2,000 tickets were released on sale for the gig at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium after half the tickets were snapped up within the first two hours following the first release.

Indonesia is a secular country of some 240 million people and has more Muslims than any other country in the world.

Though it has a long history of religious tolerance, a small extremist fringe has become more vocal in recent years.
