It's not unusual for companies to take advantage of Sydney's New Year's Eve revellers by charging inflated prices - but one Uber customer has been hit with a massive $213 fare for a ride home that should cost just $50.

Uber, the app-based car service, has come under fire for charging  more than three times the normal fare for a ride home on New Year's Eve, and customer Jade Wilkes was shocked when she woke up on January 1st to discover she had fallen victim to the ridiculous price hike.

Ms Wilkes booked a 14 kilometre ride from Sydney's CBD to Coogee, a ride which would normally cost around $50 in Uber's luxury 'Black' vehicle, only a quarter of the $213 she was charged in the early hours of January 1st.

The app, which connects people with available drivers in their area, warned Ms Wilkes that the fare would be calculated at 3.1 times the normal rate, reportedThe Sydney Morning Herald.

She accepted the fare multiple with Uber Black at 2am after entering her starting point, and despite the company's promise of 'no surprises', claims not provided with an estimated price.

'The [surge pricing notice] just came up without my having to enter a destination, so I didn't have a fare estimate,' Ms Wilkes said.

She said that the app, which requires a credit card on file for cashless payment, only provided her with a receipt at the end of the trip, totaling a hefty $213.

Katie, a spokesperson for Uber, said that a fare estimate was always available in the app, regardless of whether there was a 'surge' in action or not.

'A splash screen comes up when surge is on, and customers have to accept the number and type it back in,' Kate said.

'You can definitely get the fare estimate, there are multiple ways to acknowledge and confirm the fare,' she said.  

Kate said that surge was a tool to encourage more drivers to the area, and that as soon as demand for vehicles and supply evened out, surge would disappear and pricing would return to normal.

Ms Wilkes said that the email she received stated that 'the normal fare was $68.90, but I made the same journey for $35 in a taxi today,' she said.

Labeling the fare for the 23-minute journey 'ridiculous', Ms Wilkes contacted the driver of the car only to be told that any issues with the fare had to be taken up with the company.

Uber emailed customers to notify them that there would be an expected surge of 3.1

Ms Wilkes sent an email to the company, but so far has reportedly not achieved a resolution. 

Uber previously came under fire for offering inflated rates for lifts home from Sydney's CBD during the Martin Place siege, with customers reporting fares of more than $100. 

With police calls to evacuate the area, demand for Uber outstripped its supply of cars, kicking in an automatic price surge to attract more cars to the area.

During the early stages of the siege, Uber's fares reportedly jumped fourfold, and the company later apologised in a statement.

'The events of last week in Sydney were upsetting for the whole community and we are truly sorry for any concern that our process may have added.' 

The company said it wanted to help get as many people as possible out of the CBD, but it communicated its intentions poorly, leading to misunderstanding about its motives.

'We didn't stop surge pricing immediately,' Uber said in its statement. 'This was the wrong decision.' 

But the company later reversed course, offering free rides out of the city centre and refunds to those hit by higher prices.

'It's unfortunate that the perception is that Uber did something against the interests of the public,' Uber said. 'We certainly did not intend to.'  

The company, which launched in Sydney in 2012, warned potential customers of peak periods over New Years Eve, recommending split fares and car shares for revelers to get home safely without breaking the bank.

The company's website encourages customers to be aware of their estimated fare before accepting rides, stating that 'Surprises aren’t for everyone. That’s why we’ll always notify you in BIG, BOLD print if surge pricing is in effect and ask you to manually type in the higher multiple before you can request a ride.'

'Enter your drop off location and tap “Fare Quote” to get an estimate of the cost of your ride.'

However, Ms Wilkes said she never received the estimate, and would have rethought her travel options had she known how much her trip would cost.

'I told them that I wasn't given a cost estimate when I got in, and I never would have gotten into the car if I'd known it would be that much. I would have taken a taxi. I mean, that's basically the cost of a flight,' she said.

Ms Wilkes was one of thousands who were expected to participate in ride-sharing over New Years Eve, despite Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian reminding Sydneysiders that the activity is illegal.

'Here in NSW we have been very clear that it is illegal for drivers to participate in what we call 'ride-sharing' activities like UberX,' Ms Berejiklian told The Sydney Morning Herald.

The service allows for unaccredited drivers to offers rides, flouting strict laws in NSW against drivers in unlicensed vehicles offering transport.

11% of Sydney's population is thought to have participated in the scheme, sparking thousands of dollars in fines and nearly a dozen court attendance notices to UberX drivers.

'This is a complex issue and cities all around the world are grappling with it as we speak,' said Ms Berejiklian.

Uber has been contacted for comment.
