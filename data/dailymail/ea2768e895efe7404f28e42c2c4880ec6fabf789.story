Mamma mia! What is this? Gino D’Acampo may currently be Britain’s favourite Italian chef – a man who appears to be on TV almost every day – but it turns out his own family don’t think he’s up to much in the kitchen.

This revelation becomes apparent when he returns to his Naples home as part of his first primetime TV show, Gino’s Italian Escape, and he’s shaking like a leaf as he makes salmon pasta and cherry tiramisu for his mother and close relatives.

'I can cook in front of millions of people on TV, I don’t care,' says Gino. 'But cooking for my own family really freaked me out. If they don’t like it, they tell you. They’re a bit too honest, they should lie a bit more.

Back to his roots: Gino D'Acampo has returned to his native Italy for a new TV show out next month

'My mum can’t believe I’m a TV chef in England. She says, "I’m amazed, how did this happen when you’re so messy and not as good as me?" I say, "If you’re such a great cook, why don’t you have a cookery show?" She doesn’t like that. She thinks I’m a bit too cocky...'

Gino’s Italian Escape finds Gino, 37, taking a mouthwatering journey around southern Italy where he grew up, revealing the delicious secrets of the area’s traditional dishes and sourcing the ingredients that make them so special.

He goes cherry-picking in Campania and gets to touch sacred 3,000-year-old olive trees in Puglia.

'They have microchips in them so that if anyone touches them it sends a satellite signal and the police will be there in ten minutes.'

There’s even deep-fried pizza in Naples. 'At school we used to eat it and I’d forgotten the taste,' he recalls. 'It doesn’t taste deep-fried, it’s absolutely beautiful.'

And it’s not just the food that takes centre stage in the show – Italy’s breathtaking scenery is one of the highlights. In one episode in the beautiful Puglian town of Alberobello he gets to cook on the roof  of one of its unique cone-shaped trulli houses.

Tucking in: Gino gets to grips with some Italian classics - and finds some new favourites

'That was a pretty special moment,' he says of the Unesco World Heritage Site, one of the country’s most striking tourist attractions. In Rome he even cooks outside the magnificent Colosseum after sourcing his ingredients at the central market.

From there he heads to the Amalfi coast, and stops off at the resorts where he holidayed as a child to cook and meet the locals.

'My mum and dad used to take my sister and me there on camping and fishing holidays so it was great to revisit and tell the story of the area through food,' he recalls.

And there were a few surprises in store, even for Gino. 'I never realised Amalfi lemons had no pips and were so sweet they could be eaten like apples. The skin is beautiful and spongy, not acidic like the ones that you get in Britain.'

He believes the trip has only made him more passionate about what the Italians have, and what we in Britain lack. 'What’s special about Italy is the weather, and the fact that they have respect for their ingredients,' he says.

'In Britain you can’t grow beautiful tomatoes or courgettes and there is not so much respect for ingredients. We allow supermarkets to sell rubbish. We should all be saying, "You know what? We’re not going to buy strawberries at Christmas because we don’t need to." A key rule for every cook should be not to buy food when it’s out of season because it’s expensive and tastes awful.'

2,400... Years ago pasta was first made and eaten in what’s now the north-west  of Italy 600... The number of pasta shapes  in existence,  from penguins to mobile phones  51... The weight in pounds of pasta eaten every year  by the average Italian

He thinks we have a misplaced idea about what good Italian food is, and he hopes that by showing an Italian enjoying the best Italy has to offer he’ll give us a fresh understanding about this land of foodies.

'Very few Italian restaurants in Britain do a good job,' he says. 'They’re too scared to show you what real Italian food is like because they think you can’t handle it, so they dilute it. A lot of the sauces in Italian restaurants here don’t make sense. They’re non-existent in Italy.'

The sauce he makes for the salmon to serve his mother is a fiery arrabiata. 'This dish has been completely forgotten because people believed chilli was too overpowering for salmon, but it isn’t. Similarly, real carbonara sauce doesn’t have cream and mushrooms like it does here.'

All of this led Gino to open a pasta and sandwich bar in the City of London recently; his plan is to have 20 across the country  in the next few years.

'I was there a year and a half ago and I realised how much rubbish they sell. So I decided to open a proper  pasta bar – good carbs, real Italian ingredients. Everything’s fresh. We’re already cooking for 500 at lunchtime.'

Gino’s love of food is in his genes. His grandfather was head chef at a restaurant in Naples and Gino used to leave school early to watch him at work.

'I wanted to be just like him,' he recalls. Gino started his own chef training when he was 13, but despite being fascinated with Britain as a boy he never imagined he’d end up here.

Then love intervened. He met half-British half-Italian Jessica Morrison when he went to work in Sylvester Stallone’s Mambo King restaurant in Marbella when he was 18.

She was his first love and, after a brief split, he decided she was his only love and he followed her to Britain. 'I never tried to convince my wife to move to Italy,' he says. 'She wouldn’t have liked that.'

He started working for a ready-meals company which led to his first TV break, as a guest on Good Food Live on UKTV Food.

With his good looks, Italian charm and fabulous accent he was soon on every foodie show going, before ending up with a slot on This Morning. But it was his winning appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2009 that made him our favourite adopted Italian. 

Home is a £1 million pad in Elstree in Hertfordshire, where he lives with Jessica and their two sons Luciano, 11, and Rocco, eight.

His wife may do most of the cooking but he very much rules the roost the Italian way. 'Whenever we can we always eat together and everybody sits at the table,' he says. 'Everybody starts to eat when I sit down. Nobody gets up from the table until I do. I like to have the respect.' Maybe you should tell that to your mother, Gino!

Gino’s Italian Escape, 13 September, 8pm, ITV. The accompanying book (Hodder & Stoughton, £20) is out on 14 September.
