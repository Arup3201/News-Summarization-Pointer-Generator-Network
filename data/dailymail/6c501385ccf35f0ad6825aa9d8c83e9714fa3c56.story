California police are investigating a violent assault at a skate park after a video surfaced on Facebook showing a teenage boy knocking out a homeless man, who can be seen lying on the concrete ground unconscious for several minutes.

The incident recently occurred at Hunt Park in Riverside.

The cellphone footage shows the transient, identified by KTLA as 'Shane', in an argument with a 16-year-old on a BMX bike.

Words exchanged by the pair allude to drugs, with one of the teens heard saying: 'You better walk away before you get hit.'
