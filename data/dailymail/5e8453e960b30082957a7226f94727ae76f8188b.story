It’s illegal for women in Iran to appear in public without wearing a headscarf – or hijab - but dozens have posted bare-headed photographs of themselves to a Facebook page called Stealthy Freedoms of Iranian Women.

Punishment in Iran for not wearing a hijab ranges from a fine to imprisonment, but despite the risks around 150 photographs have been uploaded to the site, which at the time of writing has over 140,000 likes.

The photographs show women in huge variety of places and poses.

Another photograph shows three women running up a road and carries the description: ‘Rain… Life… Freedom.’

A woman photographed on a beach wrote ‘the wind and the sun were kindly caressing my hair’.

Feeling good: Arms stretched out, this Iranian woman is clearly relishing the moment

In most of the photographs the women are alone – and stealthy – but one woman stands defiantly on a footbridge, with people around her.

The women who’ve posted to the site have only removed their headscarves, it would seem, very briefly, but even that seems to lift their spirits.

One wrote: ‘Freedom is wonderfully enjoyable, even a brief moment of it.’

Delight: This woman enjoys letting her hair down

The wearing of the hijab is enforced by Iran's paramilitary police, the Basij

The wearing of the hijab is enforced by Iran’s paramilitary police, the Basij.

Formed in November 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to be the eyes and ears of the regime, it is present in every part of society, from schools to the workplace.
