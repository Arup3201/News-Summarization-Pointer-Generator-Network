David Moyes was escorted into Borussia Monchengladbach's stadium by Toni Kroos' agent on Friday night after being alerted to a contract stand-off between the Germany midfielder and his Bayern Munich bosses.

Bayern striker Mario Mandzukic and Monchengladbach midfielder Patrick Herrmann were believed to be the two main points of interest for the Manchester United manager when he booked his seat at Borussia Park for the Bundesliga fixture, which the visitors won 2-0.

But while both are under review at Old Trafford, Kroos has dramatically emerged as a viable target after his representative Sascha Breese, from the Sports Total agency, met Moyes and coaches Phil Neville and Steve Round and sat with them at the game.

Toni Kroos is just 24 but already has 41 appearances for Germany under his belt. Joining as a youngster from Hansa Rostock in 2006, Kroos has flourished into a pass master in Bayern Munich's star-studded midfield.

Alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger, Javi Martinez, Thiago or any of Bayern's other superstars, Kroos can pull the strings, drifting into the space behind the forward-thinking Thomas Muller, Mario Mandzukic, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery.

Fans of Manchester City won't remember Kroos's last visit to England too fondly, when he played all 90 minuted of the humbling 3-1 Champions League win at the Etihad earlier this season.

Kroos was also instrumental when Bayern performed a similar feat against Arsenal last campaign. He bagged the first goal in the 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium.

At 24 and with a stack of Germany caps to his name, Kroos is a perfect fit for the area of United's team in most urgent need of improvement, and the Germany midfielder could be prised away after stalling over a new deal at the Allianz Arena.

His current deal runs out at the end of next season, and Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge admitted: 'It is always about money in every agreement, and talks have so far failed to lead to a new contract for Toni. We are interested in prolonging his stay with us.'

Bayern would doubtless ask at least £25million for Kroos, but United have illustrated their willingness to spend big by agreeing a £37m fee for Chelsea's Juan Mata.

Bayern are also hoping to open contract talks with Mandzukic, but United will be heartened by news of a fall-out between the free-scoring striker and coach Pep Guardiola. Mandzukic, whose contract runs until 2016, was evidently accused of lacking enthusiasm in training and axed from the squad for Friday night's game.

‘Mandzukic could pack his bags,' said club legend Franz 
Beckenbauer. 'I see Lewandowski in
 the attack, his playing style is suited for (Pep) Guardiola's ideas 
than that of Manduzkic.

‘There
 are even more reasons why he could leave - even without him, Guardiola 
could still count on Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze in attack.’

Significant lead: Bayern Munich's victory took them 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga

As for the match itself, Muller set up 
one goal and scored a penalty to help the Bundesliga leaders go 10 points clear as the league 
resumed after the winter break.

Despite
 the absence of key players, including the injured Franck Ribery and 
Bastian Schweinsteiger, Bayern picked up where they left 
off in December to stretch their unbeaten run to 42 consecutive league 
games.

After a nervous 
opening spell in which third-placed Gladbach squandered a 
golden chance, Bayern, who have now won their last nine league games, 
settled and came close when Gotze's shot scraped the post.

Gotze started in a lone striker role after Mario Mandzukic was dropped
 from the squad for not having trained well, according to sports 
director Matthias Sammer.

He
 soon had better luck when Muller raced down the right wing and cut the
 ball back for his Germany team mate to drill into the net for the lead 
after seven minutes.

Gladbach
 were constantly on the backfoot against a Bayern side who never hit top
 speed but controlled possession, using defender Philipp Lahm as a 
holding midfielder while Spaniard Thiago orchestrated the game.

The
 hosts did come close twice on the stroke of half-time with Bayern 
goalkeeper Manuel Neuer palming a Kruse shot on to the post and denying 
Juan Arango from close range.

Muller
 got on the scoresheet eight minutes after the restart, converting a 
penalty to condemn Gladbach to their first home defeat of the campaign
 before the hosts hit the woodwork again through Herrmann.

On
 Saturday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, on 37 points, are in action 
at lowly Freiburg while Borussia Dortmund, fourth with 32, host 
mid-table Augsburg. Gladbach are third on 33.
