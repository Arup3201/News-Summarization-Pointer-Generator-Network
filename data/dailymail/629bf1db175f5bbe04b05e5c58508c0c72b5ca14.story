John Terry will sign a one-year extension to his Chelsea contract after Jose Mourinho revealed that it is now ‘a formality’.

The 34-year-old will be a leading contender for the PFA player of the year award after some outstanding displays at the heart of defence.

Chelsea have acted quickly to reassure John Terry that he will remain at Stamford Bridge

Mourinho kept him sweating on a new deal last season, but this time Chelsea have acted quickly to reassure their captain that he will remain at Stamford Bridge.

The Chelsea manager, who takes his team to Southampton on Sunday, said: ‘There are no doubts that he is going to get another contract. I know that, he knows that.

‘We in the club, in the board, we know that and I think also you have to feel that.

‘Without us confirming anything you have to feel that. He’s a very important player in the team so the next contract sooner or later will come. It’s a formality.

‘He’s a happy guy and he’s playing well, he likes his team-mates, likes the manager, he works well. It’s a very happy group and I think John feels very, very well.’

Terry scored for the second successive game against West Ham on Boxing Day and will start for the Barclays Premier League leaders at St Mary’s.

Despite their impressive form, Chelsea’s manager is wary of Louis van Gaal’s fast-improving Manchester United as they head into the second half of the season.

Although Van Gaal’s side are ten points behind Mourinho’s team, United and second-placed Manchester City still have to travel to Stamford Bridge in the league.

Mourinho added: ‘If were were top of the league by 15 points we would be pretty sure but we are speaking about three points and after that Manchester United are also not far.

‘I have lots of experiences of coming from behind or being top of the league. I prefer to be top of the league and the players are exactly in the same line as me.

‘It is better to be in front. We play and we think about ourselves.’
