France plunged back into recession last night exactly a year after Francois Hollande took office, piling more misery on the beleaguered socialist president.

Figures showed the single currency’s second largest economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year.

As it shrank by the same amount in the final three months of 2012, it means France has experienced a double-dip recession – after the economy contracted in 2009 when the banking crisis sparked the deepest global slump since the Second World War.

It means that nine of the 17 eurozone countries are now in recession.

Mr Hollande is the most unpopular 
president in French history, according to opinion polls. He has often 
been criticised for his handling of the economy, ridiculed for 
attempting and failing to introduce a 75 per cent tax on the wealthiest,
 and lampooned for his personal life and his relationship with partner 
Valerie Trierweiler.

Under the tenure of the tax-and-spend 
Left-winger, the country has seen unemployment soar and business 
confidence drop. Unemployment in France has reached 3.22 million, or 
10.6 per cent, the worst since 1997. Youth unemployment is  25.4 per 
cent.

Under Mr Hollande, the French economy 
has failed to grow at all. In contrast, the UK avoided re-entering 
recession – two consecutive quarters of decline. Our economy grew by 0.3
 per cent between January and March.

European Commission President Jose 
Manuel Barroso urged Mr Hollande to proceed faster with economic reforms
 in return for being granted two more years to bring its budget deficit 
below the EU limit.

France had to make up for 20 years of lost competitiveness and reduce ‘the exorbitant weight of debt’ on its economy, he said.

French finance minister Pierre 
Moscovici blamed the decline on the moribund economies of the countries 
around it. He said: ‘We are in Europe, the eurozone countries are our 
main clients and our main suppliers, and when the environment around us 
is depressed, well, that’s the main factor in the slowing of the French 
economy.’

The bad news for the French economy 
came as the recession across the 17-nation eurozone – of which Britain 
is not a member – entered its sixth consecutive quarter, falling 0.2 per
 cent.

The euro bloc has been in recession 
since the end of 2011, but this is the first time that the economic 
malaise has spread to the core nations, France and Germany.

Germany, the largest economy, narrowly
 avoided entering recession after its economy grew 0.1 per cent, up from
 a decline of 0.7 per cent last quarter. Portugal, Spain and Italy, 
officially remain in recession, with Ireland, Malta and debt-hit 
Slovenia still to report on the last quarter. The economies of all three
 shrank at the end of 2012.

Unemployment across the eurozone is at
 a record high of 12.1 per cent, and in countries such as Greece is as 
high as 27.2 per cent.
