A Florida police officer is under fire after a photograph of him in uniform and leaning on a police car while in a passionate embrace with a woman began circulating online.

Jacksonville Sheriff's Office patrolman Irving Diaz was snapped grabbing the rear of the woman outside a Denny's on Blanding Boulevard last week.

According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, the woman was Diaz's girlfriend - but that fact makes little difference to the feelings of locals who saw the picture.

'It’s one thing to enjoy time with your girlfriend, and it’s another to do it on the city’s dime, you know?' Jacksonville resident Emily Wellstead told News4Jax.

'When you’re wearing a uniform and an officer of the law, you're kind of expected to conduct yourself in a certain manner because you are a role model in the community.'

The image was taken by Neshia Thomas, who says Diaz and his girlfriend were putting on a shameless display around 6pm on Monday.

'I mean kissing, smooching, like French kissing. Not a simple kiss on the lips,' Thomas told News4Jax. 'All they needed was a bed to fall out of the sky. It was just ridiculous.'

Thomas says she took the picture because she was offended by the behavior of Diaz which reportedly went on for 15 minutes.

'You were on top of the squad car like you were above the law, like you made the law, like you own the law.'

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has said it is looking into the incident to determine whether Diaz violated any policies with his enthusiastic PDA.

It is not clear whether the amorous cop was on-duty or off the clock at the time of the make-out session.

'It looks pretty bad, looks like that officer is groping that girl,' resident Angelo Collins told News4Jax.

'It’s pretty unprofessional. You wouldn’t expect an officer to be doing that in uniform, let alone on a police car.'

According to rules laid down by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, officers must not be seen 'engaging in sexually motivated physical contact or other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature.'
