Conviction: As horrified parents and pupils at London's elite Southbank International School are now discovering, William Vahey was hiding a vile secret

Outwardly, Bill Vahey was a pillar of respectability within the world educational community.

His global CV spanned four decades and nine countries, he attended international leadership conferences and was married to the executive director of the European Council of International Schools.

But, as horrified parents and pupils at London’s elite Southbank International School are now discovering, the American was hiding a vile secret.

Away from the classroom, where he taught geography and history, the 64-year-old father-of-two was concealing his serial paedophilia under cover of school trips.

Gloria Doll, director general of the American Nicaraguan School in Managua where Vahey’s sordid activities were finally uncovered, said yesterday he was ‘famous for wanting to lead student experience trips’.

The FBI say Vahey coached basketball at several of the schools and regularly accompanied students on overnight field trips and other ‘educational or athletic travel opportunities’.

Agents say the teacher, described by parents as highly popular and respected, ‘created a system that gave him the opportunity and the means to molest children.’ 

It is field trips on which he accompanied youngsters to Nepal and Venezuela, while working in London between 2009 and 2013, that school governors are focusing on to identify possible victims.

Graham Lacey, executive principal at Southbank International School said Vahey was subject to a CRB check when he joined the school, which revealed nothing untoward.

A second check three years later produced the same result and Mr Lacey added that three references the school obtained were ‘outstanding’.

His CV showed he had been registered as a teacher in the state of New Jersey in 1986 and his ‘immaculate record’ raised no concerns. But no check picked up on a conviction for child molestation in California in 1969.

Vahey had been arrested on six counts but pleaded guilty to one charge and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, followed by five years probation.

His
 conviction required him to register with California’s sex offender 
registry for the rest of his life – but he had simply not done so since 
1970.

Vahey, born in New 
York, graduated from California State University, Long Beach, and 
received a Master’s degree in curriculum development from a Vermont 
college.

By 1972, his child sex abuse conviction successfully hidden, the paedophile began his teaching career.

During
 the 1970s, Vahey was employed at international schools in Iran, Beirut,
 Madrid and Athens. Between 1980 and 1992 he worked in Dhahran, Saudi 
Arabia, followed by spells in Indonesia and Venezuela before arriving at
 Southbank.

He left the capital and moved to Nicaragua last year, his final job before killing himself after he was exposed.
