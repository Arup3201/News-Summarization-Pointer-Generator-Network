Labour has committed to £850million in new free schools after the next election, despite opposing Michael Gove’s flagship policy.

Ed Miliband’s party has promised that any free schools which are open or ‘in the pipeline’ after May 2015 will still go ahead.

It left the party open to charges of hypocrisy after repeatedly warning the policy of allowing parents and other groups to open new schools would end in ‘chaos’.

Education Secretary Michael Gove today announced another 38 new free schools, as it emerged Labour would not cancel planned schools if they win in 2015

Senior Labour figures have repeatedly criticised the free schools programme, calling for it to be halted.

Mr Miliband has claimed they are the ‘opposite of the thing we need’ while Ed Balls said it was part of ‘the most socially divisive education experiment for 60 years’.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has said they ‘a vanity project for yummy mummies’ and ‘a dangerous ideological experiment’.

However, according to a report in Building magazine, Labour will not cancel free schools planned to open after the next election.

It amounts to a commitment worth more than £850m in construction work, it was reported.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘Free schools that are open - or in the pipeline - will remain.’

The admission has been welcomed by building firms who feared work would be lost if the plug was pulled by an incoming government.

Mr Gove today approved 38 new free schools, providing 22,000 extra places, taking the total number of open and approved free schools to 331.

However, all but three of the 38 schools intend to open their doors in September next year, after the general election.

A Tory source said: 'Labour’s hypocrisy on free schools knows no bounds. They denigrate free schools at every opportunity – until they want the votes of parents hoping for a free school in their area.

'Only Labour could commit almost a billion pounds to a policy they say will cause ‘chaos’. It makes you wonder how much they’d spend on policies they actually support.

'We know whose side we’re on – parents desperate for a better education for their children. That’s what free schools are all about.

‘Labour should hold their hands up, admit they got it wrong and wholeheartedly back free schools.'

The government insists that the vast majority of the new schools are in areas most in need of more school places,.

Mr Gove said: ‘Free schools are giving thousands of children from ordinary backgrounds the kind of education previously reserved for the rich and the lucky.

‘Thanks to our free school programme, many more parents now have a new school in their neighbourhood offering high standards and tough discipline. Free schools put teachers – not bureaucrats and politicians – in the driving seat, as they are the ones who know their pupils best.’

A Labour party spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We set out in June last year that we would not continue with the free school programme if we win the next general election.

‘We said then that existing free schools would remain, as would those in the pipeline. We are undertaking a zero-based spending review of the DfE.’
