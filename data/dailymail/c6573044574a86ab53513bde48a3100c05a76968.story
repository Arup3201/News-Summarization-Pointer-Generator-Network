They are some of the brightest minds in the country, but these students at Cambridge University couldn't resist causing a bit of chaos as they took to the river in cardboard box boats.

Hundreds of people cheered on more than 30 cider-drinking teams as they marked the end of their exams - known to them as Suicide Sunday - with a boisterous parody of the Oxford-Cambridge boat race.

Some of the flimsy vessels cobbled together with card, glue and gaffer tape made it to the end of the half-mile course, but most sank along with their beaming captains straight into the River Cam.

Messing around in boats: Thirty teams of Cambridge University students took to the river in cardboard boxes as part of a booze-fuelled celebration of the end of term

Brainboxes: Some of the flimsy crafts fell apart around their captains - but others made it to the end of the half-mile course with the help of paddles and ping pong bats

Man overboard! The vessels were cobbled together using cardboard boxes, glue and gaffer tape for Suicide Sunday, a rowdy celebration of the end of exams

Oh no! Three students realised they had lost the race in the most awkward - and coldest - way possible, tipping into a busy section of the River Cam in the city centre

High spirits: Those who lost the race swam back to the shore and picked up a beaker of beer instead as families looked on bemused from the river banks

The teams with names like The Oar of Babylon, Black Pearl and Popeye's Pride spent the morning constructing their homemade rafts on Jesus Green in the centre of the historic city.

They then tried to race their rafts along the Backs, a section of river named for the historic colleges which back onto it, for half a mile to Magdalene Bridge.

Other students clapped and cheered from the bank as they watched the contestants, homemade oars and dinner trays in hand, try to balance beakers of beer on the sides of their wobbly boats.

The sturdier boats included multiple layers of tape over stronger cardboard tubes - but other contestants were forced to bail out straight away as their soggy models dissolved around them.

They wore crowns, wigs and pirate hats, and one group of students even designed their 
vessel to look like a dragon with a head at the front and a tail at
 the back.

Most of the boats had three or four passengers, but one sturdy vessel managed to
 accommodate eight as it whistled past a wooden punt full of 
tourists.

Boozy: Students multi-tasked by sipping on cans of Fosters lager as they tried desperately to stay afloat. The River Cam is also popular with tourists on traditional punts

Water sight: The teams' names included The Oar of Babylon, Black Pearl and Popeye's Pride and they spent the morning constructing their boats on Jesus Green

Nothing to sea here! A group of students try in vain to right their capsized craft - as their competitors sail by effortlessly in bright green fluffy wigs

It's a bit boxy in here: These students clutched their drinks between their teeth as they used improvised paddles made out of tennis rackets to compete in the race

Costume party: Some of the racers wore pirate hats as they crammed into their boxes, while others had a more leisurely time on rafts made from cardboard tubes

That's not an oar! In lieu of official paddles, some of the students appeared to have swiped dinner trays from their colleges. The event kicks off May Week in the city

Surely that's cheating! Some of the competitors were more organised and laid their hands on real oars - while one shrewdly put diving flippers onto his arms

The winning team of three male students flew to the finishing line with no competitors in sight.

The
 team, called HMS Neil, consisted of Churchill College students Chris 
Rosier and Peter Dawes, both 22 and in their final year staying 
engineering and Kenny Wiles, also 22 and in his final year studying 
maths.

'It took five days, an entire kilometre of gaffer tape and 11 cardboard tubes,' said Mr Rosier. 'We were quietly confident it would last but we weren't sure it would win. Other people were confident we would win though.'

Not everyone saw the funny side - as with many boozy events at Cambridge, some spectators rushed their children away from the screaming students.

One
 mother-of-two, who did not wish to be named said: 'It's very noisy and 
it is a bit intimidating for my children especially as they're all 
drinking in the middle of the day.'

Another group of students set their boat alight as they reached the finishing line, with cardboard strewn across the grass while students began downing 
pitchers of beer.

Fun: The annual event to mark the end of exams attracted hundreds of people who watched from the bridges and river banks in the centre of Cambridge

A member of the winning team said: 'It took five days, an entire kilometre of gaffer tape and 11 cardboard tubes... We were quietly confident it would last'

Hakuna Matata! Other team names at the crowded event included The Oar of Babylon, Black Pearl and Popeye's Pride

Precarious: Three students clutch their drinks in a show of optimism as they cling to the last vestiges of their cardboard box boat during Suicide Sunday

The boat race was among a number of 
parties to mark the beginning of May 
Week, in which students attend daily balls and garden parties to end the
 academic year on a high.

The race was held at the same time as hundreds of students attended the annual Wyverns' Garden Party, organised by the notorious Wyverns' Drinking Society.

The 85th annual party saw thousands of students drinking in celebration in a private location a few miles from the city, after it had to be moved when officials banned students from holding the event on university land.

The
 drinking society is based at Magdalene College, whose former alumni 
include Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes, the diarist Samuel Pepys and war correspondent John Simpson.

A spokesman for the University of Cambridge advised students to be careful in May Week after trouble in previous years, saying: 'Students are frequently advised by their colleges to 
look after themselves, their friends and their valuables when out 
socialising.'

But Mr Rosier defended the boat race, saying it was 'just a bit of fun.'

He added: 'It's for students who have worked extremely hard all year and deserve to have some fun.'

Scrapheap challenge: The preparations began early on Sunday morning on Jesus Green, in the centre of the historic university city

Students of everything from engineering and maths to literature and history turned their brains to something more simple - making things out of cardboard
