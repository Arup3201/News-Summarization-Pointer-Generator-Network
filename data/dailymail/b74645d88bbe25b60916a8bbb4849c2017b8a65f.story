A prominent attorney and his wife have been found murdered in their home a week after their daughter was stabbed.

The bodies of Jeffrey Schobert, 56, and his wife Margaret, 59, were found in their bedroom in New Franklin, Ohio on Tuesday afternoon by men working on their house.

It came little over a week after one of their two daughters, Chelsea Schobert, suffered stab wounds and a skull fracture in an attack at a house in Akron on March 23.

Jamayne Ruiz, 24, was arrested and has not been released from prison since the attack, but a law enforcement source told Fox8 they have not ruled out a connection between the two incidents.

Ruiz is being held in jail for felonious assault on a $250,000 bond.

Chelsea lists her age on Facebook as 20, but the Akron police report noted that she was 18.

On her profile, she laments bad boyfriends and hints that she has recently been through a break up. It is understood that Chelsea is adopted.

Police questioned her boyfriend in connection with her attack and her parents' murders, but he was released by authorities on Tuesday night and has not been charged.

New Franklin Mayor Al Bollas hinted to theÂ Beacon-Journal that the deaths 'might be related to something else that happened earlier in Akron' but would not confirm the link with the daughter.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is still collecting evidence at the murder scene.

Attack: Their daughter, Chelsea Schobert, was brutally stabbed just one week before the deaths

Arrest: Jamayne Ruiz, left, was arrested for the attack. Police are probing if there is a link to the deaths

Officials have released limited information, and have not said how the couple were killed. Autopsies were expected to be performed on Wednesday.

New Franklin Police Detective Mike Hitchings did confirm that Mr Schobert was 
last seen walking his dog around 7pm on Monday and that 
there were no signs of forced entry to the home.

The workmen are believed to have let themselves into the home to carry out remodeling work at 8am on Tuesday. They only discovered the bodies hours later at around 2pm.

The couple was well-known in the community and active in community affairs, the Akron Beacon-Journal reported.

Jeffrey Schobert was a prominent and well-liked 
health-care lawyer in Akron and had carried out mock trials for students at 
Archbishop Hoban High School, which his two daughters had attended.

Beloved: Neighbours said the couple was well-liked and involved in the community

He is listed on the Hanna Campbell & Powell, LLP website as leading the firm's health-care trial group, representing physicians, hospitals and other providers through the state.

Schobert successfully defended some 
of the firm's most serious cases since starting there in 1987, and was 
elected to the American Board of Trial Advocates as an associate member 
in January 2003.

He was also named one of the state's 
'Super Lawyers' from 2005 to 2011 and has been on a list of 'Best 
Lawyers in America' since 2006, the bio noted.

His wife, who went by 'Peg', was involved with charities, including the Rotary, Interval Brotherhood Home and Junior League.
