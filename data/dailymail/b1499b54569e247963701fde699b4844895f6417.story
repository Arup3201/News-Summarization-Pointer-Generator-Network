Police stopped nearly 700,000 people on the streets of New York last year, compared to 90,000 in the aftermath of 9/11.

Nearly 87 per cent were of black or Hispanic ethnicity. Of these, half were frisked and ten per cent were arrested.

Under fire: NYPD officers were left in a stand-off with a machete-wielding man after they stopped him in Times Square on Saturday

The figures come in the wake of a terrifying stand-off in Times Square at the weekend, in which a machete-wielding knifeman repeatedly lunged at New York Police Department (NYPD) officers before being fatally shot in front of shocked tourists.

Darrius Kennedy, a 51-year-old black man who appeared to be smoking marijuana, had become agitated on Saturday afternoon when officers approached him near West 44th Street and Seventh Avenue, one of the city's busiest tourist destinations.

Critics of the stop-and-frisk policy claim officers use racial profiling and have unfairly stopped a number of people.

US district judge Shira Scheindlin 
said there was 'overwhelming 
evidence' that police have conducted thousands of unlawful stops based 
on flimsy justification such as 'furtive movement'.

She berated the NYPD for displaying 'a deeply troubling apathy toward New Yorkers' most fundamental constitutional rights'.

In January, Bronx 
teenager Jateik Reed, 19, was brutally beaten by police officers in what his attorney called 'a stop-and-frisk gone terribly wrong'.

Officers alleged he was carrying plastic bags with drugs, but video footage showed Mr Reed moments before his encounter with the police,
walking down the street with his hands out by his sides.

Mr
Reed was stopped on January 26 by officers and thrown to the 
ground, handcuffed and taken away, before being charged with a variety
of crimes.

All charges have since been dropped by the Bronx district 
attorney, Robert T Johnson.

In May, a judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of four black men, meaning thousands of others who have been stopped over the years could potentially add their names to the complaint.

The New York Civil Liberties Union also rolled out a Stop and Frisk Watch smartphone app in June that allows bystanders to record police stops and instantly alert others to where it is taking place.

Police commissioner Raymond Kelly has since announced changes to officer training and supervision, and the number of stops has since declined dramatically.

But the commissioner and mayor Michael Bloomberg fiercely defend the aggressive policing and credit it with transforming New York into one of the safest big cities in the US.

They say the stop-and-frisk programme has helped prevent thousands of deaths by taking guns off the street and deny allegations of racial profiling, saying more blacks and Hispanics are stopped because many minority neighbourhoods have the highest crime rates.

Mr Bloomberg said: 'Nobody should ask Ray Kelly to apologise - he's not going to and neither am I.

'And I think it's fair to say that stop, question and frisk has been an essential part of the NYPD's work.'

Other cities have adopted policies similar to New York's, provoking the same debate.

Last year, officials in Philadelphia placed its 'stop and frisk' programme under court supervision to settle a federal lawsuit alleging racial profiling.

San Francisco mayor Ed Lee faced a backlash when he raised the possibility of adopting 'stop and frisk' to get guns off the streets.

Mr Lee announced last Tuesday that he was no longer considering it.

In New York, the police department, whose officers were hailed as heroes in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, has seen its approval ratings soar as homicide rates plummet, from a high of 2,245 killings in 1990 to 515 last year.

A poll in March found that 63 per cent of New York City voters approve of how the country's largest police force is doing its job.

But New Yorkers are divided about 'stop and frisk'.

While 49 per cent of voters disapproved of the policy, only four per cent approved.

The poll also revealed deep splits along racial lines. While nearly 60 per cent of white voters were in favour of the tactic, 68 per cent of black people were opposed.

According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, 168,126 black males between the ages of 14 and 24 were stopped - more than the 158,406 people who are in that group.

The 'stop-and-frisk' policy dates back to the 1990s when mayor Rudy Giuliani adopted a 'zero tolerance' approach to policing.

Mayor Giulliani claimed that cracking down on minor offences would help reduce serious crime.

Pressure has now been building in the 
city against the practice.

Thousands 
of New Yorkers took part in a silent march against the policy, while a New York Times editorial called on the Bloomberg administration to stop
fighting the lawsuit and 'reform its abusive stop-and-frisk' policy.
