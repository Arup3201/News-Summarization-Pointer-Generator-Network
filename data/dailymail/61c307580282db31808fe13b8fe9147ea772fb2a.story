Unseen pictures of soldier Lee Rigby with his young son have been released ahead of a charity event in his honour.

One shows the 25-year-old drummer in his army uniform holding son Jack, who is now two, while the other shows Fusilier Rigby in a Manchester United shirt, again holding his son.

The heartbreaking photographs have been released ahead of a charity truck pull in Leicestershire which will see profits donated to Jack and other local causes.

Fusilier Rigby was hacked to death in broad daylight outside Woolwich Barracks in south east London in May.

His widow widow Rebecca said: 'We are all overwhelmed by the help and support people are showing around the UK.

'We would like to say thanks to everybody. We look forward to seeing you on the day.'

She said the event would help everyone remember Fusilier Rigby. Her family will also be accompanying her, she said.

Support will also come from Harry Potter star Rupert Grint and singers Smith and Jones who appeared on the BBC talent show The Voice.

The truck pull event will be held in Medbourne, near Market Harborough, Leicestershire, on Monday, August 25.

Organiser Gary Gardner said: 'It will be the biggest event Medbourne has seen for a long time. We would really like to see the community pull together and support this great event.'
