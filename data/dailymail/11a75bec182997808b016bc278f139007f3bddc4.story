New York has become the largest city in the U.S. to raise the legal age to buy cigarettes from 18 to 21.

The latest in series of public health initiatives during the Bloomberg administration, a bill to bring the tobacco purchase age in line with the legal drinking age was approved Wednesday by the City Council.

New York isn’t be the first municipality to raise the legal tobacco age, but it is by far the largest.

Off-limits to those under 21: Cigarettes are displayed behind the counter of a city store

Should the cigarette purchase age be raised from 18 to 21?

The bill's approval was first reported by WABC, it was first announced in April by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Health Commissioner Thomas Farley

’The more difficult it is for [young people] to gain access to tobacco products, the less likely they are to start smoking, Ms Quinn said while announcing the bill.

Ms Quinn, a former mayoral candidate took the lead on this initiative, one that was originally opposed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the Daily News noted. It was originally proposed by Councilman James Gennaro.

'This, I believe, is the next big thing for the city, and hopefully for the state and for the country,' the proposal's sponsor, Mr Gennaro, said before Wednesday's vote.

The bill also includes electronic cigarettes, according to CBS New York, which reported it cites a recent Centers for Disease Control report that showed an increasing number of high school students trying the smokeless cigarettes.

Official statistics cited by NBC New 
York show that 80 per cent of New York smokers started before age 21, 
with 20,000 city high schoolers currently puffing away – and many of 
them under 18-years-old.

By raising the legal smoking age to 21, bill advocates have argued, minors with older friends will have a harder time finding people to buy them cigarettes.

The majority of those asked to buy smokes for minors are under the age of 21, officials said.Critics have lampooned the idea, pointing to the easy access minors have to alcohol.

‘I’m pre-med. I should not be smoking,’ Poli Ivanova, 20, told the New York Daily News. ‘History has shown you can’t stop people even if you move the age to 21. Kids still drink and get alcohol even when they are under 21.’

A growing number of towns and cities across the country are raising their minimum tobacco purchase ages.

The tobacco-buying age is 21 in Needham, MA., and is poised to rise to 21 in January in nearby Canton.

The state of New Jersey is considering a similar proposal, and the idea has been floated in other places, including the Texas Legislature.

‘It’s not going to work,’ another minor told the paper. ‘Cigarettes are like food, getting your hands on them is easy.’

Brookline, MA., recently raised it's legal tobacco age to 19-years-old, reports said.

No worries: Minors say they have no problem getting cigarettes and will still be able to get them if the age to buy is raised

An unintended consequence of this bill, should it become law, is less business for bodega and newsstand owners.

‘It’s bad, we’re barely moving cartons now,’ a deli manager told the paper. ‘We’ll be down to selling 3 to 4 packs a day. Our business is young people: the 18-year-olds, the college kids.’

‘I don’t know what we’re going to do.’

Stores found violating the new law would be fined $1,000 for the first violation each day, and as much as $2,000 for a second violation, according to CBS New York.

Licenses to sell tobacco could also be revoked for repeat offenders.

New York has been at the forefront of the effort to curb smoking during Mr Bloomberg's three terms in office.

The mayor proposed in March to require shops to keep tobacco products in cabinets, drawers, under the counter, behind a curtain or in other concealed spots until a customer asked for them.

He said the displays 'invite young people to experiment with tobacco.'

The measure ultimately failed, but that did not deter hizzoner from trying a different approach.

This latest effort to keep cigarettes out of the hand of teenagers is expected to go into effect early next year.

The city banned indoor smoking in 2003, ahead of all cities and states but California. Until recently it also had the country's highest taxes on smokes - Chicago just enacted the highest 'sin tax' in the country.
