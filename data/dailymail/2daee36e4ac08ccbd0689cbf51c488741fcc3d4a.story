A man has been sentenced to eight months in federal prison for phoning in a fake bomb threat before a One Direction concert.

The British boy-band were due on stage in Pennsylvania on July 6, but the day before they appeared a New Jersey man called to say if they played then the stadium would blow up.

In court documents William Klein, 47, said he made the threat after failing to get tickets to the show for his two teenage daughters.

The day before a One Dircetion concert, William Klein threatened to blow up the Hersheypark Stadium, Pennsylvania, because he couldn't get tickets for his daughters

The concert had been sold out for months and when he broke the news to his daughters, one of them threatened to never speak with him again.

Despite his lawyer saying in mitigation that he was the victim of 'uncontrolled teenage rage', Klein was sentenced to eight months after pleading guilty to interstate communication with threat to injure.

U.S. Attorney Peter Smith said Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, which runs Hersheypark Stadium, received a call July 5 during which a male caller says, 'If One Direction plays tomorrow, the stadium will blow up.'

Smith said the call was tracked to a pay phone at a 7-Eleven in Northfield, N.J., and Klein was identified from surveillance footage.

The stadium was placed on lockdown before the concert, followed by a bomb sweep and a check of concertgoers' bags.Â 

One of the teenagers said she would never speak to him again, and in mitigation Klein's lawyer said he was 'just another victim of uncontrolled teenage rage'
