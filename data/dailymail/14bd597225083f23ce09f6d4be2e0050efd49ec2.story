You only have to go on sites like Facebook and Flickr to be bombarded with other people's personal moments captured on camera.

All over the internet through social networking, image-sharing and news websites, we are exposed to a vast array of pictures.

And, as these incredible images show, it is this relatively new cultural phenomenon which inspired Dutch artist Erik Kessels with his latest installation.

Swamped: Erik Kessels has created this incredible room of pictures after downloading and printing out every picture uploaded to Flickr in 24 hours

He has created this amazing room of one million images after downloading and printing out every picture uploaded to Flickr in a 24-hour period.

For his project, Photography In Abundance, he wanted to give visitors the opportunity to grasp the immense scale of just how many photos are shared on one site on a daily basis.

Speaking to Creative Review, the artist said: 'We're exposed to an overload of images nowadays.Â

'This glut is in large part the result of image-sharing sites like Flickr, networking sites like Facebook, and picture-based search engines.

'Their content mingles public and private, with the very personal being openly and unselfconsciously displayed.

'By printing all the images uploaded in a 24-hour period, I visualise the feeling of drowning in representations of other people's experiences.'

There are more than six billion photos on Flickr at the moment, and to make matters even more incredible, that exact same number of photos are uploaded to Facebook every two months.

What's Next?, the Future of Photography Museum is on show at Foam in Amsterdam until December 7.

Keen to share: Erik Kessels used his installation - called Photography In Abundance - to give visitors the opportunity to grasp the immense scale of just how many photos are shared on one site, in this case Flickr, on a daily basis
