A teenager born a girl but living as a man has defended now dating his mother's 31-year-old best friend.

Bobby Fransis Barnes, 19, from Worcester, has found romance with mother-of-three Donna Price - who used to be his babysitter.

Bobby, who works as a barber, is waiting to have female-to-male chest reconstruction and sex-reassignment surgery on the NHS as soon as possible.

As a child, Bobby used to cut off his pigtails and rip off his girl clothes because he knew he was a boy on the inside.

He said: 'I have never lived any other way, I had to stand up for myself or I would get bullied.Scroll down for video

'I would be fighting almost every other day and my mum was at school every other week. I tried to control my anger but I came to a point where I thought, "I'm not taking it any more, I will have to man up or I'm going to get bullied for the rest of my life".

'Other kids knew not to mess with me. People said, "You have got bottle - you have got courage".

'I just want people to stop the hating.

'My mum risked everything for me. It would have been so much harder if not for my mum.'

19-year-old Bobby, from Worcester, has found romance with mother-of-three Donna Price, since the pair first kissed after a chance meeting in November

His mother Tracey Wood has been 'his rock' throughout his transgender journey and now she has given her blessing to the couple

Bobby, who has 10 brothers and sisters, said at high school he was allowed to take part in school games with the boys but some children called him 'a lesbian, a transvestite and a freak'.

He said: 'After I appeared on This Morning someone said I should have been shot at birth.

'I just laugh at it. They make jokes but they make themselves sound like idiots.

'Donna [his partner] took it hard but I have got more good comments than bad, more lovers than haters.'

The couple appeared on This Morning with Bobby's mother Tracey Wood and their story charmed hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield who said: 'You can't stop true love.'

Bobby, Tracey and Donna all appeared on This Morning to  share their story

Bobby and Donna met years after Donna had lost touch with his mother Tracey, and fell in love immediately

Bobby says that acting like a boy has always just come naturally. He and Donna had each others' names tattooed on their hands within weeks of meeting each again

Bobby's mother Tracey has always supported him in his quest to change sex, and now supports his relationship with her old friend Donna.

She said: 'He
 was misbehaving one day when he was little and I said "What do I have 
to do to make you behave?" he told me that he wanted to have a boy's 
haircut and a boy's school uniform like his brothers and so that's what I
 did.'

'It has never been a secret. I always said not to lie about anything, just be honest.

'When he got with Donna, who already knew about everything, I felt a relief because it wasn't just me anymore.'

Smiling as she showed off her engagement ring and the matching tattoos that the couple had etched on their wrists within weeks of meeting each other Bobby's fiance Donna described how the pair had bumped in to each other years after she had been his babysitter:: 'I bumped in to him, said "alright bab", I didn't think I would 
be walking out of the pub with him because I was there to kiss someone 
else!

'But then Bobby spun me around and just kissed me.

'I was scared because his mum Tracey 
was my old friend and I have known him from such a young age ... but I 
don't need to care about people's feelings now as long as I know I love 
him, because we are going to spend the rest of our lives together.

'And Tracey said she was glad he was with me.'

Bobby has now set up a Facebook page about his journey that he hopes will educate and inspire others

He has already had hormone treatment for two years, which means he has a man's voice and said others going through a similar thing should not conceal their feelings

After they appeared on This Morning the couple were the target of abusive comments but Bobby says: ''I just laugh at it. They make jokes but they make themselves sound like idiots,'

Bobby,
 who like the rest of the family spent most of the interview grinning, 
said: 'From day one I always felt this. It just came naturally.

'It has been a bit of a struggle, but with my mum's support it went quite smoothly.

'I got a bit of gip at school, but the more I have explained to people the better it has been.'

Bobby
 said his mother Tracey Wood, had been 'a rock' to him, as had his 
friend Gail Braznell who is writing a book about his life.

He recently set up a Facebook page called Born this way to give people a better understanding of his journey.

And
 a consultation at a clinic in Charing Cross in London in October could 
provide dates for the surgery he needs to make him male.

He said: 'I'm looking forward to that. It's a long way off but it's going to be worth it. I just want my op done and dusted.

He has already had hormone treatment for
 two years, which means he has a man's voice and he said others going 
through a similar thing should not conceal their feelings.

'Don't be scared to tell anyone because there is support for people out there.

'It isn't just you on your own. I want to inspire the young people.

'People think they're alone but I have had lots of support from my family and friends.'
