Serial thief: Joshua Bennetts, 21, from the Longlevens area of Gloucester, was blasted for his contribution to a 'crime wave of bicycle thefts'

A 21-year-old serial thief walked free from court yesterday despite admitting his 70th crime.

Joshua Bennetts, of Gloucester, was blasted by Judge Jamie Tabor QC for his involvement in a ‘crime wave of bicycle thefts’ in the city.

He appeared at Gloucester Crown Court after stealing two bikes together worth up to £1,300 with equally-prolific offender Rhys Shardlow, 20, who now has 63 offences to his name.

Judge Tabor said no sentence had yet deterred Bennetts, adding: ‘I cannot overlook your simply appalling criminal record. Sixty-nine previous offences. More than 20 of them for dishonesty.’

Bennetts and Shardlow denied burgling the property of an Adrian Harper to take the bikes, which the prosecution accepted. Both thieves had been in custody since their arrest in May, although Bennetts was recently bailed.

Judge Tabor sentenced Bennetts to a five-month overnight curfew until February 1, after he had served the past few months in custody.

‘I don’t know what is going to stop you offending,’ he said. ‘All I can do is recognise the fact that you have spent some time in prison on remand for these offences. They are not trivial. Stealing bicycles in Gloucester is an epidemic and these were valuable bikes, not some old jalopies.’

He has pleaded guilty in previous years 
to the likes of aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, possessing
cannabis and theft.

The judge adjourned sentencing on Shardlow for two weeks, telling him he would not send him to jail if he could be found suitable accommodation.

But Shardlow told the judge he would refuse to go into a hostel and would rather stay in prison.

He wanted to stay with friends until he found his own accommodation, he said. The judge remanded him in custody - saying if he refused to accept a hostel place, he might have to be jailed.

Hearing: Judge Jamie Tabor QC said at Gloucester Crown Court that no sentence had yet deterred Bennetts

Hearing: Bennetts was one of two defendants appearing at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) over the theft of two bikes jointly worth up to £1,300 - the other being equally-prolific offender Rhys Shardlow, 20

The prosecution applied for a criminal anti-social behaviour order (Crasbo) against both men to restrict their freedom and movement in a bid to curb their crimes.

But the defence objected to its terms. Steve Young, defending, said prosecutors' call for a two-year curfew would be such an imposition on the defendants that it could be a human rights breach.

Judge Tabor said: ‘I would not impose a two year curfew but I would make a no-go area and a ban on association between them.’

He adjourned the Crasbo issue until September 19 so the defence and prosecution could discuss the order's terms. The judge added that he was concerned bicycle thefts were an ‘epidemic’ in the city.

‘These young men are part of a crime wave which is well known in the town at the moment,’ he said. ‘Theft of cycles is at epidemic proportions. I am well aware of that.

‘These two have a remarkable number of previous convictions for dishonesty and generally bad behaviour. The court has so far failed to deter them from laying their hands on other people’s property as if it is their own.

‘They have so far singularly failed to follow anything the court directs for anything other than a short period of time.’

Sarah Jenkins, for Shardlow, said he no longer had an address to go to when he leaves prison because his family have moved and were not in contact with him.

Judge Tabor said: ‘My task is to protect the public from his persistent bad behaviour. I find that very difficult to do if I don’t have an address where I can keep an eye on him.’

The judge told Shardlow: ‘I am not in a position to sentence you until I know where you are going to live. We are going to find somewhere for you.’

Shardlow retorted: ‘I won’t live in a hostel. I won’t go there. I would rather stay in prison.’ But the judge said: ‘Well, we might have to find another hostel for you downstairs.’
