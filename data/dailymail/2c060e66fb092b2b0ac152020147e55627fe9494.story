Thibaut Courtois looked impressive in his first training session since returning to Chelsea.

The Belgian keeper has spent the last three season on loan at Atletico Madrid, but has finally moved back to his parent club and will compete with Petr Cech for a place in the first team.

The 22-year-old is widely considered to be one of the world's best young keepers and Jose Mourinho admitted his Courtois's presence can only be good for the side.

Speaking to The Mirror, Jose Mourinho said: 'To have Cech and Courtois means we have the best young goalkeeper in the world and one of the top-three or five most experienced keepers. For me and Chelsea, it’s perfect. Maybe one of them won’t be happy but the Chelsea supporters will be happy and they’re more important than players.'

Jose Mourinho also revealed today that Fernando Torres would definitely not be leaving the club. The Portuguese manager stressed the importance of having three strikers and even though one foreign player will have to be left out to comply with Premier League rules, it will not be the Spaniard.

He said: 'Three strikers is fundamental in the squad and we have three - Nando, Didier and Diego.'
