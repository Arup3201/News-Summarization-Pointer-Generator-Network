They are the neighbours from hell - a pair of loved-up randy peacocks shrieking loudly throughout the night.

The birds mysteriously arrived in an inner city area of Manchester a few weeks ago and are keeping neighbours awake.

Sleep-deprived locals have even called police to try and track down where they came from.

And residents living on streets off Alexandra Road in Whalley Range say they are desperate to have them re-homed.

Neighbour from hell: Local councillors are now looking at trying to re-home this lovemaking peacock and his partner in a nearby park

One resident said she thought the pesky bird pictured was beautiful, but it was just too loud

The two new residents have also become something of a Romeo and Juliet who are now inseparable - both day and night.

Joan Barton, 73, said: 'It’s a blinking nuisance - I’ve been chasing it off my garage roof with a clothes prop.'

Sleep deprived: Alexandra Road, in Whalley Range, Manchester, where the peacocks have been getting frisky

However they are an ill-tempered bird which doesn't mix well with other domestic birds.

Paul Unslow-Leaver, 45, said: 'I’d just like them to go back to where they came from.

The male peacock's tail feathers spread out in what is known as a feather 'train' which is more than 60 per cent of the bird's total body length.

The feather train is used in mating rituals and for courtship.

Females choose their mates based on the size, colour and quality of their prospective partner's feather train.

Some males gather harems of several females, each of which will lay several eggs.

They can be slightly ill-tempered, however, and don't mix well with other domestic birds.

'It’s driving the kids mad - it starts calling at 3am and by the time I get up for work at 5am it’s usually outside our back door. You just wouldn’t believe how loud it is.'

Resident Eva Manley said they were 'beautiful birds but the peacock is just too loud'.

'The first time it let out a scream I’d come out into the garden and I just ran back inside.

'It starts at about 5am and just keeps going and going.'

Neighbours first contacted police to try and trace the birds’ owners - but no reports of any lost peacocks had been made.

Officers advised residents to contact the RSPCA - but the charity say they are unable to help because the birds are not sick or injured.

Local councillors are now looking at whether the pair could be re-homed in nearby Alexandra Park.

A male peacock's tail feathers are used during courtship and the more impressive its feather display, the more desirable it is.
