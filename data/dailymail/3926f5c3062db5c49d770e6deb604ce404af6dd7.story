Bobbi Kristina's beau has issued a hysterical plea to her family on Twitter - insisting his presence in hospital will bring her out of a coma.

Nick Gordon took to social media insisting that the 21-year-old would wake up if she heard his voice.

It follows reports Whitney Houston's daughter was using cocaine, heroin and drinking heavily on the night she was found unconscious in a bathtub.

On Saturday, Gordon wrote: 'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!'

Plea: Gordon, who has been frozen out by the family for weeks, insists his presence will help the 21-year-old

Demands: The extraordinary outburst also included a request to massage her once she heard his voice 

Ink: He then posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo with his partner's name on, saying it was healing nicely 

He then added: 'If she hears MY voice let me massage her, play her favorite music I believe it will help. If you ask Bobby anything abt [sic] he cannot answer.'

In the rant, he also posted a picture of a recently-completed tattoo of Bobbi Kristina's name on his arm alongside the message: 'Healing fine just like my baby.' 

It is the second public appeal he has made following weeks of being frozen out by his family. Reports suggest he is also subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital.  

On Wednesday, Gordon’s lawyer Randall Kessler said his client ‘desperately wants to be with the one he loves.’

Gordon's efforts to see Bobbi Kristina have been blocked by the family claims Kessler, with relatives of Bobby Brown threatening to lay ‘hands on him’ if he shows up. 

Kessler said, ‘[Nick] has respected the family's wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation… He continues to hope that his request will be granted.'

A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown (above) was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub

Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives.

He sent a defiant message to Bobby Brown and the Houston family just days ago when he had the ailing heiress's name tattooed across his arm in huge letters. 

A new report which surfaced on Saturday claims that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub.

In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. 

Sources say she used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother three years earlier

Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claim, and was 'distraught' still over her mother's death three years ago.

One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words.'

She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital after being found by her possible husband Nick Gordon, and remains in critical condition. 

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. 

Earlier this week she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy.

Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition.

This as Gordon has reportedly become the main focus in a criminal investigation into what caused this incident.

Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31.

She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said.

The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out. 

Couple: Bobbi Kristina with Nick Gordon in 2012. She said she had married him although, after her drowning, that was denied by her father. They were brought up together since he was taken in by Whitney Houston
