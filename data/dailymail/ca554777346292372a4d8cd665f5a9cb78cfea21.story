Barack Obama pleaded with Congress to green-light a $6.18 billion funding request to fight Ebola on Tuesday, appearing at the National Institutes of Health to urge lawmakers to fall in line.

The president told scientists, NIH staffers, patients and a global audience that America's strategy to slow the deadly disease's advance was finally bearing fruit – but insisted the 'fight is nowhere close to being over.'

'Every hotspot is an ember that if not contained can become a new fire, so we can't let down our guard even for a minute,' he said.

'And we can't just fight this epidemic. We have to extinguish it.'

Ebola remains largely confined to a handful western African nations, and the White House says the U.S. should stop the disease there

His funding request has fallen through the cracks as a congressional lame-duck session winds down and Republicans prepare to take over leadership of the U.S. Senate in January.

But the president said 'we can't beat Ebola without more funding. It's a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world.'  

The White House has been engaged in a strategy to protect the U.S. from the spread of the Ebola virus after it took hold this year in western Africa.

The nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have seen significant concentrations of diagnosed cases, while just a few infected people have made it to the United States.

Obama used his photo-op to reassure Americans that even though their attention may have moved to other issues, the public-health fight against Ebola remains an urgent priority in his administration.

The president toured portions of the NIH headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland before delivering 25 minutes of remarks.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci and cell biologist Dr. Nancy Sullivan escorted him through a second-floor Ebola lab at the NIH Vaccine Research Center.

A few minutes later, according to a White House press pool report, the president appeared before assembled cameras and asked, 'So, what have we got here?'

A joking Obama told Dr. Sullivan that he had 'brushed up on my organic chem[istry] and I'm ready to go.'

'Sullivan walked through a series of slides on a computer screen and the president asked questions occasionally, though often with his back to the [press] pool and inaudible,' the pool reporter added.

LIBERIA: Health workers in Africa are still engaged in the critical but gruesome work of disinfecting dead bodies as the Ebola epidemic claims dozens of lives every day

The NIH announced last week the initial success of America's first Ebola vaccine trial, a milestone that Obama called 'exciting' – while allowing that science provides 'no guarantees' that a working vaccine will result.

The vaccine study involved human 20 volunteers, and resulted in no side effects. But it's unclear if the shots work, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to try them in west Africa.

Sullivan has been working on the vaccine concept at NIH for years, and had already demonstrated that it blocks Ebola's effects in research monkeys. 

After the African outbreak swelled in the spring, the NIH moved quickly to compress its typical five- to ten-year research plan into a period of months.

Obama closed by calling NIH 'America's lab.' 

He rattled off the names of complex technical tools, according to a pool report, 'and joked the White House has a similar apparatus that is used to brew beer.'
