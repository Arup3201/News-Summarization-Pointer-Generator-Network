A woman who lost half her leg to bone cancer had her foot reattached backwards - and it wasn't a mistake.

Shanna Decker, 24, was seven when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after complaining about a pain in her leg. 

Doctors said they would have to remove her left knee to save her life.

But instead of an amputation, Decker opted for a 'rotationplasty': when the foot is attached to the thigh and rotated backwards.

It means Decker, from Minnesota, has more control over her prosthetic calf.

Choice: Shanna Decker, 24, opted to have her left foot reattached to her thigh backwards after doctors removed her left knee. The operation, which removed a cancerous tumor, saved her life

The forward-facing heel acts as a new knee and the foot can move like a shin.

If she needs to, Decker can even apply weight to the foot - which has retained its feeling - and walk on it.

The then-novel procedure was one of three options available to Decker, while she endured a grueling chemotherapy program.

Doctors could have amputated her leg below the thigh or created a 'stiff leg'.

More control: The decision Decker and her parents made when she was seven (left) means that she now has more control over her prosthetic leg and can manoeuvre it better than if she had undergone an amputation

Delighted: Seven-year-old Decker was amazed at how quickly she learned to walk again after surgery

Due to her age, Decker was not eligible for 'limb salvage', where the missing tissue is replaced with transplanted or artificial tissue, as her legs were not fully developed.

Instead, she opted for rotationplasty, which removes the tumor and the knee and rotates the foot 180 degrees.

Writing on Rotationplasty.com, her mother said: 'I remember this being the hardest decision our family has ever faced. When we initially learned of rotationplasty, I have to admit, it took time to absorb. We had many questions and desperately wanted to connect with others who had already chosen this procedure, but found that to be difficult.'

No regrets: Decker has now set up a foundation to help children who are considering rotationplasty too

Aside from the difficulty overcoming the appearance of her new leg, Decker said she never thought twice about it.

And learning to walk was simple - unlike the months-long process most amputees endure.

'As soon as my leg healed, I was walking with a prosthetic and it took me about three seconds to learn how to rewalk,' Decker told Everyday Health.

Hoping to inspire children who are facing the same predicament she tackled 17 years ago, Decker has founded a charity called Brighter Tomorrows that supports young cancer sufferers.
