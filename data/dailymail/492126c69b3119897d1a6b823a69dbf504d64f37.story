Many people who lined up for days to be among the first in the world to buy the new iPhone 6 say they plan to sell them in China for triple the price they paid.

The latest version of Apple's popular handset went on sale in Australia and some other countries on Friday, triggering buyer mania as fans queued around the block.

But the staggered release of the iPhone 6 means it is not available in some countries - including the world's largest mobile market, China, where Apple is yet to announce a release date.

The basic model iPhone 6 16GB sells for $869 in Australia.

It has already appeared on Chinese e-commerce such as sea.taobao.com, where it is selling for 12,000 renminbi, or around $2,175,00. 

Customers outside Apple's flagship store in Sydney told Daily Mail Australia on Friday Chinese buyers are paying up to three times the retail price for the top of the line model iPhone 6 Plus 128GB - just 50 were released at the George Street Apple store.

The queue at the George Street store in Sydney went on for four blocks, some people camped for days

The first lot of buyers outside the George Street store bought the 50 iPhone 6 Plus models

Website airtasker.com had people sign up to the website to recruit people who could stand in the iPhone queue and get paid up to $300. 

Jon Farrell, 21, web designer for the site, said: 'Lots of people are selling them abroad.I would say up to 40 per cent are being sold overseas.' 

Jon Farrell and airtasker.com CEO Tim Fung said some people were getting paid $300 just to queue

Jason Lee, a 22-year-old accounting student at the University of Technology Sydney, said he had queued outside the Apple store for 20 hours to buy the iPhone 6.

'I am buying two of them and selling them onto a friend who will sell them to people in China,' he said.

'I am making $150 per phone and when they are sold on in China they will probably make a lot more. 

Jason Lee said he bought two iPhone 6s - one for him and one to on-sell in through a friend in China

'There is so many people in China that want the phone. It is really common for people to be buying the phones to then sell them on.

'Everyone would have been here to get the iPhone 6 Plus but the first 50 have been sold which is disappointing.' 

As many as five million iPhones may be smuggled into China before the new models are officially available, said Neil Shah, Mumbai-based research director for devices at Counterpoint Research, bloomberg.com reported.

The gold version of the iPhones are going for as much as $4,000 on the Chinese black market. 

Mr Lee and three friends, Jacob Jing, Matthew Tsui, Charlie Zhang, spent more than 20 hours waiting for the phones

Jacob Jing, 24, another University of Technology Sydney student, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I have seen so many familiar faces in the queue, loads of students from university. 

'All night I heard people talking in Mandarin about how they were going to sell the phones. 

'I would say between a quarter and half of people in the queue are getting them to sell onto other people. 

'So many people in the queue are doing that.'

Dedication: Katherine Su, 18, and Coco Zing, 19, were a few of the lucky ones to get the iPhone 6 Plus model- they camped for two days  

Two lucky people who got their hands on the iPhone 6 Plus were Katherine Su, 18, and Coco Zing, 19, who camped outside the George Street Apple store for two days and were tenth in the line when they both picked up their iPhone 6 Plus handsets. 

Katherine told Daily Mail Australia she bought one phone for herself and one for her mum who is  in China.

A source told Daily Mail Australia: 'Lots of people have bought the Plus version just to sell on.

'I have seen lots on taebao.com which is like the Chinese Ebay.

'I have been in the queue for 18 hours and I have heard people speaking in Mandarin about how much money they will make.' 

People camped and slept outside for days waiting for the new release
