A man who allegedly tried to attack 
and rape a pregnant woman who was taking her dog for a walk in broad 
daylight in Manhattan has been pictured in new surveillance footage 
released by the police.

He was filmed on Sunday morning 
pouncing on the woman, who managed to fight him off and escape, leading 
to an ongoing NYPD manhunt.

Now police have publicised another video showing the man making a purchase at a deli in the Inwood neighbourhood, near the scene of the attempted rape.

The new footage shows his face more clearly than the original video and could aid in the search for the alleged rapist, believed to be in his 20s.

Suspect: This man is believed to have tried to rape a woman in the Inwood neighbourhood of Manhattan

Manhunt: Police have been hunting him since the alleged attempted rape on Sunday morning

In the original surveillance footage, he jumps on the 30-year-old victim, who is two months pregnant, and attempts to rip off her clothes and reach into her shorts, but the brave woman is able to fight him off as she cries for help to passers-by.

The video then shows the man running 
away. The suspect was dressed in a white T-shirt, denim shorts, sneakers
and a red baseball cap and appeared to be 6 feet tall and 180 pounds.

The suspect, who had been sitting on a park bench, grabbed her from behind as she walked her dog.

NYPD
officials said the man tried to shove his hands down her shorts and 
beat a hasty retreat when she bit his chest and screamed for help.

Followed: The lady (whose face has been blurred) is being trailed by the man (visible behind her)

Moving In: The woman bends down to check on her dog while the would-be rapist approaches the lady in Manhattan

A superintendent of a nearby apartment building heard her screams and came to her aid.

The attacker fled.

The
police released the surveillance footage in an effort to catch the 
woman - and her face has been obscured to protect her identity.

'It’s a pretty shocking thing to have something like that happen in 
the neighborhood,' one resident told WCBS 880′s Marla Diamond.

'Believe 
me, this is not the safest neighborhood in the city, but I’ve never seen
something so brazen.'

'We need to take kickboxing, karate, whatever to defend ourselves,' said a woman who works nearby.

Terrifying: The man tried to bear hug the woman - who begins to thrash wildly

Saved: The man stops his rape attempt as members of the public rush to the ladies help

This comes as another woman in Brooklyn faced off an armed assailant at gunpoint who tried to abduct her early on Monday morning.

The 27-year-old was depositing money at a Chase Bank ATM in Carroll Gardens when she saw a man following her in his car.

The driver pulled over two blocks later and aimed a gun at her, pistol whipped her and then tried to pull her into his car.

The victim was released when she began to fight him and started screaming. She suffered minor injuries and police have not yet apprehended the man.

Anyone with information about either attacker is asked to contact the NYPD Crime Stoppers hotline:
