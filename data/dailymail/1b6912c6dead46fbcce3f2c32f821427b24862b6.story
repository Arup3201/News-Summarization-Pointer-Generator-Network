Going solo: Dawn French, 56, will perform at arenas around the UK from June 5 to August 2 this year

She has spent most of her comedy career as one-half of the double act French and Saunders.

Now Dawn French has announced she venturing out alone with her first solo stand-up tour.

The 56-year-old, whose last tour with Jennifer Saunders was panned by critics in 2008, said she will draw on material from her own life and career in the new show, called 30 Million Minutes.

It will open in Sheffield on June 5 and tour the country until August 2. However, as no London dates have yet been announced it is expected the tour may be extended if it is successful.

Miss French said yesterday she was ‘sick with excitement’ about the tour.

She added: ‘I am enjoying the fact that I can’t categorise exactly what it is, but it’s somewhere between a monologue, a play, and an autobiographical slide show with a few funnies thrown in.

‘At last, I have one of my three genie wishes granted, which is that I finally get to work with [director] Michael Grandage. The other two wishes are as yet unfulfilled.

‘They are secret obviously, but suffice to say, one is about Barack Obama in speedos. The other is about me in speedos, with cheesecake involved.’

The Vicar of Dibley star first shot to fame in 1982 when she and Miss Saunders, 55, appeared in The Comic Strip on Channel 4.

The pair first met at acting school, where Miss Saunders dismissed her as ‘cocky’ and she thought miss Saunders was ‘snooty and aloof’.

They went on to become friends and their hit sitcom French & Saunders ran for six seasons.

Six years ago they attempted a comeback with a West End stand up show Still Alive, but critics branded it ‘tired’ and ‘lifeless’.

Although this is her first solo stand-up 
appearance, Miss French has appeared on stage alone before, acting in 
one-woman West End play My Brilliant Divorce in 2003.

Discussing the possibility of doing a one-woman stand-up show last year, she said: ‘The thought of doing it without Jennifer is hard, but I’m now very used to my own company.’

Miss French married charity boss Mark Bignell last year. She divorced comedian Lenny Henry in 2010.

Tickets to her new show will cost between £25 and £39.50 and will go on sale on Friday.
