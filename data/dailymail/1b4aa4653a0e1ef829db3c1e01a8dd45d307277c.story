A New York City preservationist is convinced that he has found the exact location of a legendary 18th century watering hole where General George Washington is believed to have stopped for a drink to celebrate his army's victory over the British.

Adam Woodward told the radio station WCBS that the future first president of the United State and New York Governor George Clinton ducked into the Bull's Head Tavern at 50 Bowery after enemy troops had retreated from the city in 1783.   

The historic building located at the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge has housed many businesses over the centuries, including most recently a Duane Reade pharmacy and a popular Chinese restaurant.

But now the structure is slated for demolition to make room for a new hotel - a move that Adam Woodward is hoping to halt.

Doomed landmark: Preservationist Adam Woodward claims he has found evidence that 50 Bowery, which is slated for demolition, is the former site of an 18th-century tavern where George Washington drank

Working against the clock, the preservation activist was able to gain access to the basement of 50 Bowery, where he discovered what he believes to be hand-hewn joists and foundation walls consistent with Colonial-era architecture.

‘I just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York City history,' he said.

New York lore has it that the Bull's Head Tavern first opened around 1755, catering to cattle farmers and merchants, according to the New York City history blog The Bowery Boys.

The establishment had a prime location east of Collect Pond - a bustling commercial hub crammed with tanneries, slaughterhouses, stockyards and stables.  

Towards the turn of the 18th century, the tavern was transformed into a busy cattle market where food and drink continued to be served to farmers, who amused themselves by gambling on dog fights and bear baiting displays.

Working class hotspot: Bull's Head Tavern opened around 1755, catering to cattle farmers, merchants, tanners and employees of local stockyards and slaughterhouses

The humble working-class watering hole was thrust into the limelight on November 25, 1783, when General George Washington, Governor Clinton and 800 Continental  Army troops converged on the Bull's Head Tavern, preparing to enter New York City in a triumphant procession on the heels of the routed Redcoats.

The tavern was later operated by the businessman and well-regarded butcher Henry Astor, a scion of a prominent German-American family, who prided himself on serving his customers the finest cuts of meat.

For several years, the site of the historic tavern housed a stove emporium until in 1858 a large German beer hall dubbed Atlantic Garden took up residence at 50 Bowery.

Rowdy: The busy beer garden was subjected to several police raids in the second half of the 19th century for selling alcohol on Sundays

In the 1870s and 80s, the rowdy pub was repeatedly raided for selling brew on Sundays in violation of the city's excise laws.

Atlantic Garden shuttered its doors for good in 1911, to be replaced by a 'modern theater and office building' with a price tag of $300,000, according to a New York Times article published at the time.  

‘The whole issue of whether the Bull’s Head was buried inside the Atlantic Garden was one of the great mysteries of New York,’ Woodward told the Times.

The preservationist and photographer described how he entered into the debris-strewn edifice and spotted 19th century ironwork.

When he descended into the bowels of the condemned building, Woodward noticed that the construction material has changed from modern cinder block to brick and stone.

Standing under the sidewalk of the Bowery, Woodward looked up and saw what he believes to be 18th century building materials.

Prominent businessman: The property at 50 Bowery is owned by Alexander Chu, president of Eastbank and the biggest landlord in Chinatown

‘I was thinking, "I am standing in the cellar of the Bull’s Head,"’ he recalled to the paper.

Woodward and historian David Freeland, who also researched the site, are hoping to save the building from being razed to the ground – at least long enough to conduct a thorough archaeological investigation.

They believe that 50 Bowery, currently owned by banker and real estate investor Alexander Chu, could be the oldest surviving structure on the island of Manhattan, according to NY Eater.

Architect Peter Poon has drawn up plans to construct a 20-story, 220-room hotel that is expected to be unveiled in early 2015 under the name Hotel Bowery, the site Bowery Boogie reported.

The Lo-Down NY reported that the Landmarks Preservation Commission has been made aware of Woodward's discoveries, but it cannot force the owner of the property to delay or abort the construction project.
