Running around town centres just got a whole lot more interesting - thanks to a new craze in which joggers create shapes and spell out words using GPS apps which record their routes.

The latest version of the trend is to create giant animals  by snaking through populated areas to map the outline of their shapes.

Runners from West Sussex are now competing to produce the most impressive animal and have already mapped out a puppy, giraffe, elephant, reindeer and bird.

Spring in their step: A group of runners from West Sussex have caught on to the new run-mapping trend by jogging a winding five-mile route around their home county to form the shape of a puppy

Runner Chris Robinson, 43, was one of the first people to attempt the trend - jogging a shape of a cow and using a GPS tracker to map it on running app Strava before posting it to his Facebook page.

The father-of-two, from Rustington, received streams of positive feedback and believes the craze could be a new way of encouraging people to get fit.

He said three strangers soon joined his quest to make animal art, and the group all ran the Brighton Half Marathon together on Sunday each logging record times.

Co-owner of a marketing firm Mr Robinson said: 'It started when I came back from a run and saw my route and it looked a bit like a cow's head.

'I thought if I can do a head then I wonder if I can find a body and I spent ages on the map to find a whole cow.

'I put it on Facebook and got a lot of comments and I put a link to a sponsor page for a race I was running.

'Someone who sponsored me said here's £20, now do a giraffe. So I did.

'Then Clare who I had never met wanted to do a better job so she did Rudolf the reindeer and even did a red nose by running round a roundabout for 20 minutes.'

Through the app Mr Robinson rallied a team consisting of Clare Bartlett, 39, of Rustington, Howard Crompton, 35, of Angmering, and Kevin Bett, 32, of Littlehampton, and they started running animals across West Sussex together, in October.

They recently shaped a puppy together in a five-mile run that saw them running round in circles in a park to form its eye.

Mr Robinson added: 'It required going to Google maps and working out that we had to start at a dog poo bin then run a perfect circle. We must've looked like idiots.

'But we got to the end of the end of the run and we didn't feel like we'd run five miles at all.'

The West Sussex animal run craze was started by Chris Robinson, who created the outline of this cow and posted it on Facebook

New incentive: Mr Robinson believes the craze could be a novel way of encouraging people to go running

He raised £1,258 in the 13.1-mile half marathon and donated it to the Springboard Project, a charity that has supported his 12-year-old daughter Bella who has autism.

The craze has also become popular in San Francisco, with cyclists and runners both using the app to map out shapes and messages to potential employers and to loved ones.

Dan Miller, of San Francisco, recently hit the pavement in the city's SOMA neighborhood just before applying to Strava for a job.

Using the firm's app he spelled out 'hire me'.

Strava, MapMyRide and various other so-called 'cyclist apps' work on a very similar basis.

Their point? To allow riders to record their activity on a range of compatible GPS devices, including iPhone, Android, some fitness watches and Google Glass.

The kind of data they can record include the distance and where the cyclist has been on a detailed map - pinpointing exactly where the rider has been from start to end.

Calories burned, duration, speed, elevation and pace are also among the features it can track.

Some even give suggested routes, uploaded by other users.

Cyclists can then browse, analyse and compare their efforts with previous ones as well as other users and challenge themselves to do better. Their results can also be shared with friends and ranked on a leaderboard.
