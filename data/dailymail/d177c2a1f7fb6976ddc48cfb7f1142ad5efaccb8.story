Many BMW fans will likely be horrified by the customised 'paint job' that this Z4 has endured.

But a rare few may actually love it.

At the very least it's difficult not to appreciate the amount of work that has gone into this dragon auto-job.

A matter of taste: To some this might be their dream BMW 'paint-job' but it's unlikely to appeal to the masses

But effort is no guarantee of achievement, and its questionable whether anyone would genuinely be seen in this vehicle.

Or whether it could still get anywhere near the Z4's usual top speed of 156mph.

Sprayed a gaudy gold, the BMW Z4 has then painstakingly been adorned with the limbs of a dragon, including legs and feet with golden claws, wings on the scissor doors, a tail that sashays behind it and a bonnet that is covered in scales.

Each and every scale is made from the bone of China's indigenous mountain yak, and is designed with a dragon-inspired pattern.

It might be eye-catching, but whether or not the vehicle performs well is another question, given the excess weight from the bone, and resistance from the design.

The unique design was on display last week at the China Import and Export Fair, in the southern Guangdong province.

It's not known if this model was for sale - and if so, if it sold - but it certainly stood out from the crowd.
