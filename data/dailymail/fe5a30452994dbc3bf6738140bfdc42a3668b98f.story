For those of us who dream of festive food treats but expect to be on a tighter budget this year, Aldi has potentially provided a solution.

Scrimping shoppers can look forward to a feast of caviar, whole crab and king prawns this December - all on a shoestring budget.

The discount supermarket has announced that its Christmas offerings are inspired by Michelin-starred restaurants.

Festive and fancy: Aldi's Christmas offerings for 2014 are based on Michelin-starred restaurants (actual food not pictured)

This follows a report in May that found that budget supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular with - and are now fiercely competing to cater to - the middle-class.

To which end, Aldi is reaching above and beyond with its Christmas menu this year, offering up with king scallops in garlic butter, a hidden-centre Christmas pudding and smoked salmon, among other treats.

The supermarket's five bird roast is undergoing an upgrade for Christmas 2014, now containing  turkey, goose, duck, pheasant and chicken, all wrapped in bacon.

The budget supermarket is becoming increasingly popular with the middle-class shopper

A survey for Good Housekeeping magazine found that 53 per cent of 
shoppers had switched to cheaper stores or divided the shop between a 
supermarket and budget store since the recession.

The poll found more
 than 40 per cent shop regularly at Aldi and Lidl, with just 2 per cent saying they would be too embarrassed to shop in discount stores.

Aldi has not yet revealed prices for the products, but based on previous years it looks to be an affordable array.

For example, a packet of 12 pork and chestnut stuffing balls cost £2.19, while the pure-breed British Turkey (3-5kg) retailed at £39.99.

And last year its £1.69 Christmas mince pies 
trumped brands almost eight times more expensive in an annual taste test
 by a major consumer group, which also bodes well for this year's offering.

Aldi's Christmas range will start to appear in stores from mid October.
