Wanted: Police want to speak to Lloyd Trainer, 24, in connection with a burglary on an antiques shop

A man wanted for questioning over a burglary at an antiques shop has fled Britain and become a rep for the firm behind the now infamous Magaluf sex video, it was claimed today.

Lloyd Trainer, 24, featured on the BBC's Crimewatch less than a month ago in connection with a high-value raid on a shop in Petworth, West Sussex, in January 2012.

Police said he had links to Glasgow, Surrey and London - but a Facebook profile for Trainer now says he is living in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Spanish holiday island.

And two days after he was featured on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow on June 12, he posted a photo of himself smiling in a bar.

According to The Sun, Trainer has been herding teenagers round the holiday resort of Magaluf for Carnage, the firm behind the now notorious sex video which was leaked online last week.

A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Lloyd Trainer, 24, from Surrey, is wanted for a high value burglary from an antiques shop in Petworth in January 2012. He has been wanted by police since then.'

A source told the newspaper that Trainer had been 'bragging about how he has been on Crimewatch, showing people clips from the show on his phone'.

The video shows 24 men receiving a sex act from an 18-year-old woman who was reportedly promised a 'free holiday' - which turned out to be the name of a cheap cocktail. It prompted horror and outrage from thousands of people on Twitter, where the firm initially revelled in the publicity.

The @carnagemagalluf Twitter account, which has posted photos of teenagers slumped on the floor and others with the hashtag #exvirgin, retweeted dozens of compliments and insults about the video as publicity mounted.

Its organisers then wrote: 'We are not responsible for the girl's actions. The girl and her eight friends bought tickets for the next barcrawl as they said it was amazing!

'All you 
need to do is look at the video and you can see she clearly isn't drunk 
and knows what she is doing. Definitely not forced in any way.'

But
 a friend of the woman in the video, from Northern Ireland, claimed she 
was a born-again Christian who had 'made a terrible mistake'.

The footage was described by 
many as a new low in Magaluf, where pub crawls were regulated for the 
first time this year following years of complaints by locals.

Spanish mayor Manu Onieva 
voiced his ‘absolute indignation’ and said police were investigating the
 practice that local press have dubbed ‘mamading’ – a play on the crude 
Spanish word for a sex act, ‘mamada’.

Despite the outrage, Carnage barcrawls attract hundreds of participants - with more than 400 people, many teenagers on their first holiday without their parents, on one recent event alone.

The firm is not linked to Carnage UK, a separate barcrawl firm which has also made headlines.

Benefits Street's 'White Dee', real name Deirdre Kelly, was a guest 
of Carnage Magalluf in May and was photographed at a party wearing the 
company’s T-shirt.

And Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take part in the game, claimed the participants had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture.
