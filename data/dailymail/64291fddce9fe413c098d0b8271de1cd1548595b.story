Stuart Lancaster's refusal to guarantee Steffon Armitage a place in his Elite Player Squad (EPS) was a significant factor in Bath’s failed bid to sign the Toulon star ahead of next year’s World Cup.

Bath head coach Mike Ford admitted on Thursday the deal was ‘dead in the water’ with RFU unwilling to help fund the £240,000 transfer fee demanded by the French giants.

But it has emerged that Lancaster told Armitage’s advisors that the depth of back-row talent available to him in England meant he was unable to provide assurances the 29-year-old would be included in the 33-man EPS squad which he announces this Wednesday.

Stuart Lancaster did not give Armitage any guarantees 

'Steffon wanted to firm assurance that he would be named in the EPS but there was no way Stuart could give that,' an England insider told Sportsmail.

Northampton flanker Calum Clark is expected to be named alongside captain Chris Robshaw, Tom Wood and James Haskell on Wednesday – with strict RFU selection criterion meaning only English-based players can be selected - with Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees’ place in serious doubt.

Bath’s uncapped Fijian-born winger Semesa Rockoduguni – who only signed professional papers two years ago and still a serving soldier in the British Army – is also in line to be named in Lancaster’s 33-man squad.

Clark’s inclusion would raise most eyebrows, two years after he was banned for 32 weeks for breaking the arm of Leicester hooker Rob Hawkins. Lancaster – who coached Clark as a youngster at the Leeds Academy - has made several attempts to blood the uncapped 25-year-old, only to be thwarted by suspension and injuries, but MailSport understands he is in line to be named this Wednesday.

Saracens flanker Will Fraser is understood to have edged ahead of Gloucester’s Matt Kvesic and is being seriously considered, while Haskell – who this week signed a lucrative new contract at Wasps – will also be included alongside No 8s Billy Vunipola and Ben Morgan.

Twelvetrees' Aviva Premiership form has been patchy so far this season and with Bath No12 Kyle Eastmond in sensational form and highly-rated Saracens inside centre Brad Barritt fit again and apparently certain to be included, the 25-year-old Gloucester centre faces an anxious wait.

Lancaster has yet to settle on his favoured wing combination and Rockoduguni – a tank driver with the Scot Dragoon Guards who completed a six-month tour of the notorious Helmand province in Afghanistan as an infantryman in 2007 – has made an irresistible case for inclusion.

‘The way I see it, I want to make every opportunity count and take every single opportunity that comes my way,’ the 27-year-old told Mailsport this week.

‘When you experience something like (Afghanistan) that it teaches you a lesson in life. That’s how I’m looking at my professional rugby career. I have one go at this and I don’t intend to mess it up.’

Marland Yarde is certain to be included as one winger – despite taking time to settle at his new club Harlequins this season – but with Exeter’s Jack Nowell not fully fit and Jonny May yet to convince at the highest level, Lancaster’s wing options remain relatively thin. Saracens experienced flyer Chris Ashton could yet make the final cut.

Danny Care has established himself as England’s first-choice scrum half ahead of next year’s World Cup and will be one of three scrum-halves named along with Ben Youngs and Lee Dickson.

Fly half Danny Cipriani looks set to be among the most unfortunate to miss out. The 26-year-old made his first England appearance in almost six years this summer and has been in superb form for Sale this season.

But with Owen Farrell and George Ford assured of inclusion, and Stephen Myler’s consistency admired by the England management, it would take a significant about-turn for the in-form Cipriani to be included.

Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes and Dave Attwood will be three of the locks with Geoff Parling set to be named in the EPS but unlikely to feature this autumn after a string of concussions for Leicester. Northampton’s Christian Day, Saracens George Kruis and Leicester’s Graham Kitchener are vying for the final second-row spots.

Dave Wilson, Matt Mullan, Henry Thomas and Joe Marler will be the props with Dylan Hartley and Rob Webber at certain to be named as hooker with David Paice favourite to be named as the third No 2.

Saracens Richard Wigglesworth and Northampton's Lee Dickson are battling for the third scrum-half spot.

Long-term injured Dan Cole (neck), Tom Youngs (shoulder), Geoff Parling (concussion), Alex Corbisero (shoulder) and Tom Croft (knee) are expected to be named in the EPS but will not feature any of the four QBE internationals this November.
