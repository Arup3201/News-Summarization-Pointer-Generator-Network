An MP has called for a top air traffic control boss to be stripped of his bonuses after a computer glitch caused flight chaos for tens of thousands of passengers.

Dozens of flights were cancelled on Friday and Saturday with hundreds more delays after a computer system at air traffic control company Nats suffered a catastrophic failure.

MP Paul Flynn said Richard Deakin, chief executive of Nats, should lose his bonuses for overseeing the travel crisis.

The Labour MP told the Sunday Times: 'I hope after the chaos, which was dreadful, though a rare event, he will have his bonuses stripped from him.'

Around 70 flights were cancelled on Friday following the glitch, which shut down airspace over London and parts of southern England, leaving planes circling as engineers tried to fix the problem.

A total of 38 more short-haul flights were cancelled yesterday at Heathrow as the airport tried to clear the backlog.

Gatwick Airport said there had been 16 cancellations and seven diversions of inbound flights on Friday, but normal service resumed yesterday.

Airports as far north as Aberdeen and Edinburgh were also affected by the computer problem. Other airports that reported delays on Friday included Manchester, Stansted, Luton and Bristol.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the disruption was 'simply unacceptable'.

MP Louise Ellman, chairman of the Transport Committee, said Mr McLoughlin will be asked about the the computer failure at Nats headquarters in Swanwick, Hampshire, when he appears before the panel tomorrow.

Mr Deakin, who was paid more than £1million a year, including £272,000 in bonuses, told the BBC: 'The problem was when we had additional terminals brought into use and we had a software problem that we haven't seen before which resulted in the computer which looks after the flight plans effectively going off line.

'The good news is of course that everything came back online 45 minutes later, the back-up plans went into action as they should have done, so everything performed normally there, the skies were kept safe.

'Unfortunately there was reduced capacity and I would just like to reiterate our apology that we have made to passengers and indeed to airlines and airport customers for the disruption that was caused.

'But I think the key message is that the skies were kept absolutely safe during that 45 minutes of problems that we experienced at Swanwick.'

Mr Deakin added that it was a 'very unusual event' which had not occurred before.

Airlines are claiming the unprecedented IT failure was beyond their control - which enables them to dodge compensation claims from passengers. Pictured are passengers stranded at Heathrow

He said: 'The challenge is that we have around 50 different systems at Swanwick and around four million lines of code. This particular glitch was buried in one of those four million lines of code.' 

Nats gave the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) a report earlier this year following major disruption caused by a communications problem last December. 

Nats bosses were told months before this weekend's flight chaos that their contingency plans for technical failures lacked 'detail and clarity'.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) told Nats earlier this year, after disruption to flights last December, that they needed to be better prepared for computer glitches, the Independent on Sunday reported. 

Around 300 flights were cancelled after last year's technical failures, leading the CAA to ask Nats to explain how they would ensure it would not happen again.

The regulator said 'themes on avoiding a recurrence' were a 'good first step but lack detail and clarity'. 

A spokesman for the CAA said the report lacked detail. 'We asked them to do a little bit more work on it,' he said, adding that Nats said this weekend's chaos was unrelated to what caused last December's disruption. 

Despite thousands of passengers qualifying for up to £470 in compensation because of the long delays and cancellations, airlines may not have to pay up because of an EU loophole allowing them to refuse to pay out if the issue was caused by 'extraordinary circumstances'. 

It is unclear whether the computer glitch falls into that category, with experts warning that passenger payouts are not a certainty. 

Under EU rules, delayed passengers can claim compensation if they arrive at their destination more than three hours late.

There are differing limits on payouts which depend on the length of the delay and how far the intended destination is away.

But airlines can refuse to pay up if the issue which caused the delay was out of their control. Some airlines used this clause as reason not to pay out after the Icelandic volcano ash cloud caused chaos in 2010.
