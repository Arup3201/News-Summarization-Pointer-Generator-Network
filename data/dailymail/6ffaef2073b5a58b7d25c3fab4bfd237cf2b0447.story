Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has refused to rule out the possibility of Frank Lampard coming back to manage the club in the future.

Mourinho said he can see the England midfielder returning to Stamford Bridge ‘very, very soon’, after Lampard and the club parted ways at the end of the Premier League season.

‘I do not think he is leaving,’ Mourinho told ITV during a United Nations ambassadorial visit to Ivory Coast. ‘I think he is just going for a ride somewhere and then he is coming back very, very soon because that’s what the owner wants, that’s what he [Lampard] wants – what everybody wants.’

When asked if Lampard might manage Chelsea, the 51-year-old said: ‘Whatever he wants, whenever he wants. I repeat Mr Abramovich’s words – I will have him doing anything.

‘The door is open for such a big guy in our club.’

Mourinho has been in Africa visiting hungry children and HIV patients to support the World Food Programme, rather than attending the World Cup in Brazil.

Last week the Portuguese coach invited Lampard to return as his assistant manager after admitting the letting the midfielder go was one of the most difficult acts of his career.

Mourinho said: ‘You can’t imagine how difficult it was. I think only Frank knows that, but at the same time I can feel some happiness about the process because, for sure, he comes back to Chelsea.

‘He can be a coach, he can start at the academy, he can start being my assistant at the same time because he is doing his coaching badges, or he can start in a different role.’
