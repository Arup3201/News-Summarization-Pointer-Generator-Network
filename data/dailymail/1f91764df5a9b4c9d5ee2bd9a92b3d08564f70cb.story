Leading online movie and TV service Netflix has been accused of beginning to block Australian users from accessing the site ahead of its official launch Down Under in March.

Some of the reported 200,000 Aussies already accessing foreign versions of Netflix via virtual private network (VPN) technology, which alters their IP address, have reported access problems recently.

It’s been claimed the difficulties are due to a planned crackdown on Australian VPN users by Netflix.

Online viewing service Netflix, which boasts signature show House of Cards, is coming to Australia in March. There have been reports users are now being blocked from accessing it with VPNs

‘I have a sneaking suspicion that Netflix may be testing these new IP blocking methods temporarily in certain markets. At this time the blocks do not seem aggressive and may only be targeted at IP ranges that exceed too many simultaneous logins,’ TorGuard’s Ben Van der Pelt told TorrentFreak.

However, Netflix has denied any new lockdown, telling Cnet: ‘There have been no changes to our VPN policies.’

While visiting Australia Netflix Director of Corporate Communications and Technology Cliff Edwards reportedly said recently: ‘VPNs violate the terms of our service, and we believe very much so that anybody who licenses content should get paid for their content.’

In November, Netflix announced its service will become legally available in March 2015 to users in Australia and New Zealand who subscribe to the network.

The service will allow them to instantly watch a selection of popular movies and TV shows in high-definition

But it has not yet been confirmed whether or not Netflix will be bringing over its signature shows such House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black.

The announcement of the launch ends months of speculation about the local plans for the company.

The online service, which first launched in 2007, boasts some 53 million subscribers in dozens of countries. 

The platform will be available on smart TVs, tablets, smartphones, set-top boxes and consoles, with high-definition and 4K available.

A Netflix spokesman told Daily Mail Australia it has been unconfirmed whether shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black will be available as they are still in 'internal discussions'.

Pricing has not been disclosed but the Daily Telegraph reports it is expected to cost about $10 to $15 a month.

The announcement comes months after Nine Entertainment Co. and Fairfax Media revealed they will be launching a new Australian subscription service next year.

Marco Polo is also one of Neflix's original series, which is set to be available in Australia and New Zealand

Other launch titles include upcoming US television series Marvel's Daredevil

StreamCo is expected to launch during the 2015 financial year.

The Netflix launch is expected to ramp up the pressure on pay-TV services such as Foxtel, which recently slashed prices in anticipation.

Yet the antipodean version is likely to lag the US version given Foxtel owns exclusive local rights to shows such as Game of Thrones.

Launch titles will include original series such as Marco Polo, BoJack Horseman and All Hail King Julien, with others such as Bloodline and Marvel's Daredevil to come later in the year.

The US-based company has also gained Australian subscription video on-demand rights to superhero television series Gotham, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

However Nine Entertainment currently holds the broadcast, first-run, and in-season catch up rights to the Batman prequel.

As a result, Netflix will not be able to air the new show until 12 months after it has premiered on Nine.
