The brother of a British man and his family who were massacred in the French Alps has accused police of being 'racist' and 'incompetent'.

Zaid al-Hilli claims that French police bungled the murder investigation after they missed evidence and failed to properly secure the crime scene.

His brother Saad, 50, from Claygate, Surrey, was shot alongside his wife Ikbal, 47 and mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, on a remote road near Annecy in September 2012. 

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was also killed in the attack.

Mr al-Hilli was arrested on suspicion of Saad's murder in June last year. But by January this year, he was told police did not have enough evidence and the charges were dropped.

The businessman, who lives in Chessington, claims he has been the target of a witch-hunt by the French authorities who had spread 'lies' about him and his family.

'Our background is Middle Eastern and I think they set out to protect the white French families', he told the BBC News. 

French authorities and Surrey Police have refused to comment.

Mr al-Hilli became the prime suspect in the French police's investigation after he revealed he almost came to blows with his brother as they discussed splitting their father's estate in 2011.

But while he admitted there had been a disagreement over their inheritance, he had loved his family.

'I love my brother, I love his family, I love my nieces, I would never harm them,' he said, adding that police had now established 'that there is nothing to link our family with the crime'.

More than 100 police officers in France and the UK have been involved in investigating the case and about 800 people have been interviewed.

But Mr al-Hilli has called for a public inquiry into the case as he believes the police have missed vital evidence after officers reported they had found a passport in Saad's jacket in July- a year-and-a-half after the investigation was launched.

Mr al-Hilli also said police allowed the crime scene to become 'trashed' by emergency service vehicles.

Saad al-Hilli, 50, was shot dead in September 2012 alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, in an execution-style attack on a remote road in the Alps near where they had been camping.

The body of French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was also found nearby in a forest layby near Lake Annecy in eastern France on September 5. Each had been shot three times, all at least once in the head. 

The couple's daughter eldest Zainab was shot in the shoulder and beaten, but survived. Her four-year-old sister Zeena lay hidden under her mother's body and was only discovered eight hours after the murders. Neither of them now talk about the attack. 

Saad's brother Zaid became the French police's prime suspect in October 2013 after he admitted they argued over their £1million inheritance.

Zaid al-Hilli, 54, an accountant from Chessington, Surrey, revealed he and his brother almost came to blows as they discussed splitting their father's estate in 2011.

He was arrested in July on suspicion of masterminding the killings, hiring a hitman to take out his brother, but denied all charges. 

Up to 100 officers in Britain and France were focused on several lines of inquiry linked to the family's complex background – they moved from Baghdad to Britain in 1971 - and the large family inheritance.  

The businessman  was then cleared by British police of any involvement in January 2014 after being told by Surrey Police there was not enough evidence to charge him.

But hours later French investigators said they were considering applying for an international arrest warrant for the 54-year-old, as they still consider him a prime suspect. The case against him was later dropped.

In February this year, French police arrested former policeman Eric Devouassoux who was found with a stash of World War Two weapons and other munitions at his home.

The arrest came after police released an artist's impression of a male motorcyclist wanted in connection with the murders 

He too was later cleared of any involvement. 

Zaid al Hilli has always maintained that cyclist Mollier was the real target of the attack and claimed that police were covering up for him.
