The author of Fifty Shades of Grey earned £33million in a year from her erotic fiction, new figures show.

Accounts filed by writer EL James show she makes more than £90,000 a day from sales of the trilogy, about a sadomasochistic billionaire who has an affair with a young student.

The sum is almost four times more than the reported £8.6million earned by Harry Potter author JK Rowling last year.

Fifty Shades of Grey has sold more than 100million copies worldwide and is currently being adapted into a film starring Jamie Dornan, 32, and directed by Sam Taylor-Wood, 47.

The latest accounts filed by Miss James’ company Fifty Shades Limited show the company earned pre-tax profits of £33.4million in the year to September 2013. Profits after tax were £25.5million.

She paid herself a modest salary of £7,800 but also took a divided of £3.24million.

The mother-of-two, who is a former TV executive, paid a further £490,000 into her pension.

Miss James, 51, whose real name is Erika Leonard, originally self-published the novel online before the rights were bought by Vintage Books in 2012.

As well as topping bestsellers lists, it has spawned a series of lucrative spin-off products including two blended wines, Red Satin and White Silk.

Miss James and her husband Niall live in a £2.7million six-bedroom property in west London but have spurned a luxury lifestyle.

He said: ‘Commentators can conjure ridiculous royalty figures out of the air and imply that our afternoons are spent in an infinity pool with trained dolphins bringing us goblets of chilled Bolly, but in real life the dog has to be walked and the children have to be fed and ferried around.’

Fifty Shade’s racy plot follows the relationship between naive graduate Anastasia Steele and handsome older billionaire Christian Grey, who introduces her to sado-masochism and bondage.
