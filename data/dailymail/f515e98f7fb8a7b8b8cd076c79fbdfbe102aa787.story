Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, the jailed Pussy Riot member, is in a tuberculosis hospital in Siberia, her husband says.

Three weeks after she 'disappeared' during a prison transfer, her husband Pyotr Verzilov told the Telegraph his wife was in Regional Tuberculosis Hospital No. 1.

He says he was given a tip off from a prison staff member and was being treated for health problems there although she is not suffering from tuberculosis.Â

'Basically someone who works in the prison told me she is in the hospital. So we sent our lawyer there and he spoke to the prison head, who eventually confirmed she is there,' he said.

Mr Verzilov was waiting outside a prison in Nizhny Ingash, a remote settlement on the Trans Siberian Railway some 200 km from Krasnoyarsk, when he heard the news.

Shortly afterwards he was allowed a to speak to his wife over the phone, he said.

'She is ok. She said the conditions in this hospital are adequate and she is being treated for some health complications that developed in her previous place of detention,' he said.

He hopes to be allowed to visit his wife on Friday, he added.

Ms Tolokonnikova was last heard from on October 18. Three days later, Russian authorities said she would be transferred away from Prison Colony No. 14 in Mordovia.

Russian law does not require authorities to inform relatives of where a prisoner is being held until 10 days after they arrive in a new prison. Ms Tolokonnikova has been 'in transit' ever since she was transferred.

She was removed from Prison Colony No. 14 in October after going on hunger strike in protest at appalling conditions and what she claimed were threats from the prison administration to kill her.

The 23-year old is one of three girls charged with hooliganism in 2012.

Tolokonnikova and her bandmate Maria Alyokhina are serving a two-year sentence for their punk group's performance in a Moscow church criticising President Vladimir Putin.
