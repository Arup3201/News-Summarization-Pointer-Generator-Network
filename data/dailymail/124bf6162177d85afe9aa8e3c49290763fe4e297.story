Residents of Illinois and Connecticut are so unhappy with their states that half of residents say they would move if they could, a new poll has revealed.

One in three Americans wish they could pull up their roots and move to another state, according to a new Gallup poll. 

More people are looking for greener pastures in states with dense population - specifically Illinois (home of Chicago) and the Northeast corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. Residents said they're hoping to find better jobs, be closer to family, have a higher quality of life and pay lower taxes elsewhere. 

Illinois had the highest portion of respondents saying they wanted to leave - 50percent, followed by Connecticut, Maryland, Nevada, Rhode Island and New Jersey.

Restless: Residents of Illinois and Connecticut had the highest desire to move. People in Montana and Hawaii reporting having the lowest

It's no surprise that residents of Hawaii, who reside in a tropical paradise, aren't interested in leaving. But Montana's citizens are the happiest where they are - just 23 percent say they'd like to move.

Maine, Oregon and New Hampshire residents follow close behind. Less than a quarter say they have any interest in leaving.

A second poll question asked residents how likely they were to actually move to another state in the next year. 

Fully one in five of the Nevada residents who said they wanted to leave were said they planned to follow through. The state, which was especially hard-hit by both the recession and the housing bust, is still struggling.

Its 8.5percent unemployment rate is the second highest in the nation. The percentage of foreclosures and homeowners underwater on their mortgages are among the top, as well. 

Illinois, which follows close behind Nevada for the highest percentage of residents planning to leave, also has higher unemployment and higher foreclosure rates than most of the country. 

By contrast, the residents of Maine, Iowa and Vermont seem to being staying put. Only eight percent said they planned to move anytime soon.

A plurality of respondents - 31 percent - said they wanted to move for economic reasons - to find a better job. About 19 percent said they wanted to be closer to friends or family, while 11 percent said they were hoping to escape their state's lousy weather.

About 17 percent of Illinois residents cited this as their reason for wanting to flee - Chicago is notorious for both its cold and snowy winters and its oppressively hot and humid summers.

In New York, 21 percent of residents who wished to leave said they wanted to flee the high cost of living there. About 17 percent cited the state's high taxes.

Taxes factored into the decisions for eight percent of respondents in both Illinois and Maryland.

The data comes from a poll conducted by Gallup between June and December that interviewed at least 600 people in each state.
