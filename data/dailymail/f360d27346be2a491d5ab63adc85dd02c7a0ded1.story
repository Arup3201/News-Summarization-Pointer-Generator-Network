U.S. intelligence pressured the writer of the film Zero Dark Thirty to alter or remove scenes of torture from the script, it has been revealed.

The blockbuster film about the killing of Osama Bin Laden, dubbed a 'publicity coup' for the CIA and Obama administration, had scenes cut or rewritten at the request of the agency.

It was already known that the filmmakers had been provided with secret information about how the raid was planned, but the latest revelations show the extent to which spies shaped its narrative.

Censorship: The CIA asked the writer of Zero Dark Thirty to alter a scene so that the film's protagonist, CIA agent Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, does not help torture a prisoner, a newly released memo reveals

The CIA's informal censorship efforts were revealed in a cache of documents released after a Freedom of Information request by Gawker about the agency's cooperation with director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal.

Among them is a secret 2012 memo which summarises five conference calls between Mr Boal and the CIA's Office of Public Affairs in late 2011.

During these conversations, Gawker reports, Mr Boal 'verbally shared the screenplay' for Zero Dark Thirty, allowing the CIA's press officers to give their feedback and suggest changes.

One major alteration suggested by the CIA comes in the film's controversial opening scene, in which its protagonist, CIA agent Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, watches as a prisoner is tortured during interrogation.

An earlier version of the script had 
Maya participating in the torture, which included waterboarding and 
shoving the man into a tiny box, but the CIA told Mr Boal this was not 
true to life.

Collusion: Screenwriter Mark Boal had a string of conference calls with the CIA's PR department in which he 'verbally shared the screenplay'

According to the memo: 'We emphasised that substantive debriefers [like Maya] died not administer Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, because in this scene he had a non-interrogator, substantive debriefer assisting in a dosing technique.'

The next sentence is redacted. But it then goes on: 'Boal said he would fix this.'

That scene provoked much critical debate, with Maya's ambivalence and observer status scoured for artistic meaning. 'Of course, the scene reads a bit differently if the choice was dictated by a CIA propaganda officer,' remarks Gawker writer Adrian Chen.

A second scene which the CIA took issue with, according to a memo, featured a dog intimidating a prisoner. 'We raised an objection that such tactics would not be used by the Agency,' says the memo.

'Boal confirmed in January that the use of dogs was taken out of the screenplay.'

Of course, threatening detainees with dogs - an animal which Muslims tend to be culturally averse to - has been a well-known tactic in the War On Terror.

The technique, which is sanctioned in certain circumstances in U.S. Army interrogation manuals, was pioneered in Guantanamo Bay and features in some of the most disturbing photos of the abuses at Abu Ghraib. 

The memo obtained by Gawker is just the latest document to be released revealing the extent of the collusion between the CIA and the makers of Zero Dark Thirty.

In January it was revealed that Ms Bigelow and Mr Boal were provided with a complete 'roadmap' of how the Abbotabad raid was planned during a 45 minute meeting with Michael Vickers - the country's highest ranking civilian intelligence official.

The filmmakers also received briefings from top CIA and military intelligence officers and Navy Seals who carried out Operation Neptune Spear - the code name for the attack on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan in May 2011.

Those releases followed a freedom of information request by campaign group Judicial Watch.

Its president Tom Fitton accused the White House of acting improperly by giving 'politically-connected filmmakers extraordinary and secret access to bin Laden raid information'

The group accused the Obama administration of sharing the 'intimate details' to help the filmmakers release a movie ‘perfectly timed to give a home-stretch boost' President Barack Obama's re-election campaign last year.
