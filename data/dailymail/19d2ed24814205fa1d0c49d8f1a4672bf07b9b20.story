Inter Milan coach Walter Mazzarri believes his side can emulate Barcelona and return to winning ways after completing a transitional phase at the San Siro.

The Catalans endured a lengthy barren spell before the arrivals of Frank Rijkaard and then Pep Guardiola reversed their fortunes, which included winning the treble in the 2008-09 season, and produced a team regarded by many as the greatest club side in football.

Inter themselves claimed a treble under the guidance of Jose Mourinho as recently as 2010, but have disappointed in the last two seasons to finish ninth and fifth in Serie A.

However, Mazzarri is confident that a summer spending spree, which has seen the likes of Nemanja Vidic, Yann M'Vila and Pablo Daniel Osvaldo arrive, will see success return to the club.

'Ours is a project that goes forward in time,' he said at an event at the University of Milan. 

'A new cycle has started and no one has pointed out that we're playing with four young players.

'Just like it happened at Barcelona, we will return to winning. At Napoli I demonstrated my ability to carry out a project. My hope is to reach the Champions League right away.'

Despite his recent high profile signings, Mazzarri insists not only the star players but the whole team will need to perform to improve the club's standing. 

'You have to find the quality through work. Big signings are not the only way to create a big team.'
