A Swedish teenager has been found guilty of robbery after police found a photograph of her posing with a knife on her phone.

The 'selfie' shows the 16-year-old and another girl wearing balaclavas, taken shortly before a robbery of a fast food restaurant in Halmstad, south-west Sweden.

Just 47 minutes after restaurant staff called police, officers tracked down the teenager to a nearby flat where they found two balaclavas, 2,000 SEK (£187) and the girl's mobile phone.

It was in March this year that two young girls in balaclavas armed with an 11in kitchen knife ran in to a Max Hamburgers restaurant in Halmstad.

Staff was closing down, but there were still three customers in the facility. One of the girls threatened staff with the knife, shouting 'Hand over the money! Open the cash machine or I will cut you!,' Swedish newspaper Kvallsposten reports.

A male employee told police one of the girls waved the knife inches from his body. Staff handed over just under £190 and the two girls disappeared into the night.

It took police dogs less than an hour to follow the tracks to a block of flats not far from the restaurant. Inside the flat marked by the dog, police found three girls, 13, 14 and 16, and the oldest teen's grandfather, who told police two of the teenagers had just 'come back from a walk'.

Police located a bag with the money and two balaclavas, as well as the girl's while iPhone.

The phone contained 'a large number' of photographs of two girls posing in hoods with kitchen knives as well as instructions on how to committ a robbery and how to escape detection afterwards.

It also had a photo of cash, believed to be the money taken from the restaurant.

The girl, now 17, has been found guilty of armed robbery and sent to a juvenile correction facility. The court noted that had the girl been over 18, she would have been handed a jail sentence.

The girl still denies that she was anywhere near the restaurant at the time of the robbery. Police have not been able to identify the second robber.
