With hours of intense training each week, there’s no doubt that taking part in Strictly Come Dancing can turn your life upside down... but this is just ridiculous.

Hairy Biker Dave Myers, 56, is so determined not to be this year’s ‘comedy act’ that he has taken up anti-gravity yoga to combat his poor posture, on the advice of dance partner Karen Hauer.

The 56-year-old television chef, one half of cookery duo The Hairy Bikers, has turned to anti-gravity yoga classes to help improve his chances on the BBC contest.

The rather unorthodox exercise classes are said to help improve posture, flexibility and blood flow.

The television chef has explained his dance partner Karen Hauer suggested undergoing the workouts earlier this week after Strictly judge Darcey Bussell told him that his poor posture was letting him down during his performances.

He revealed that his crooked posture was down to his constant motorbike riding, which has led to backache and sore knees.

This Saturday the pair will perform a Salsa routine, with Dave admitting that he does not want to be considered the comedy act of the series.

The star, who narrowly avoided elimination in the first week, said: ‘I’m not trying to be a comedy act. It’s a fun dance, it’s not a comedy dance.’

Last weekend, notoriously critical judge Craig Revel Horwood praised the presenter’s Waltz as his personal best.

He said recently: ‘It was the best dance I’ve ever done. It felt really good, a grown up, serious dance and there were lots of people with tears in their eyes. It felt good being groomed too. Hopefully I can take that into this week.’

Last year Dave and his Hairy Biker co-star Si King embarked on a campaign to lose two-and-a-half stones in three months for their television show Hairy Dieters: How to Love Food and Lose Weight.

They both achieved their targets with Dave adding: ‘Strictly is helping me keep the weight off. I also started off with a bad back and dodgy knees, but Karen has been teaching me posture, how to walk properly and stand straight.

‘I’ve spent 35 years huddled over a motorbike, and now my back is getting straight, my backache has gone and my knees are great.

‘My Latin trousers which were measured on day one have been taken in twice, much to my joy. It’s the most exercise I’ve done in my life!’

Asked about his chances of winning the competition, he added: ‘If it came to a dance-off the judges have got to judge on technique and I am not going to be as technically wonderful as some of the other fantastic young dancers.

‘You don’t want to let your partner down.

‘Karen is investing 30 hours a week of her teaching time in me – I don’t want to mess it up.’
