First John Lewis touched the nation with a series of heartwarming campaigns. Then M&S hit back with an all-star line-up for autumn 2013.

Now Debenhams has joined the fray with a multi-million pound advertising campaign that plays up its style credentials and features some of London Fashion Week's biggest names.

Soundtracked by up-and-coming songbird Foxes, the 'cinematic' advertisement follows the designers at Debenhams, among them Henry Holland and Julien Macdonald, as they create pieces for the brand.

Along with Macdonald and Holland, other designers featured in the ad, which premiered during the X-Factor last weekend, include Preen, Ben de Lisi and Jasper Conran.

Preen designer, Justin Thornton, said: 'We 
are delighted to be involved in the new advertising campaign for 
Debenhams. 

'Two of our favourite pieces of the season are featured 
including a suit with bold graphic stripes designed to give a chic and 
sporty look to classic tailoring - perfect for the new season.'

Other heavy hitters from Debenham's stable of designers also weighed in to praise the new campaign, with Henry Holland describing it as 'great' and Jasper Conran saying it showcased his new campaign against a 'backdrop of intrigue and glamour'.

Debenhams say, the film, which was 
shot in Buenos Aires, features a number of 'hero products', including an
£85 floral dress from Preen / Edition, a £79 J by Jasper 
Conran biker jacket and a red fisherman's jumper from Principles by Ben 
de Lisi for £38.

The move 
comes during what Debenhams describes as one of its biggest years ever, 
with 2013 marking the store's 200th anniversary.

Debenhams
is also working on a £25 million redevelopment of its Oxford Street 
flagship store, which is due to reopen later this year.

Marketing Director, Richard 
Cristofoli added: 'We wanted to create an ad that 
appeals to the full spectrum of women that shop with us regularly.

'By 
showcasing a broader range of designer collections, we are using our 
airtime to talk to more of our customers, whether they love Betty 
Jackson or Henry Holland or both.'
