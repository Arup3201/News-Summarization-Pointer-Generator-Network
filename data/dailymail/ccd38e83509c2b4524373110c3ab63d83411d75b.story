At first glance, it may look like a replay of London 2012.

That's apart from the fact that 'Crow Farah' and 'Bradley Twiggins' are made out of straw.

Olympic athletes, including Mo Farah and cycling champion Bradley Wiggins, were paid tribute to today at an annual scarecrow festival.

This year the Belbroughton Scarecrow Festival celebrated Britain's unforgettable summer of sport 
and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

Competitors used bananas, plants, butternut squash and old clothes to create their scarecrow masterpieces.

Straw creations included Mo Farah being knighted by Her Majesty the Queen and cycling champion Bradley Wiggins with a banana helmet.

There was also an entry of Wiggins next to a makeshift gold postbox to celebrate him winning gold.

Synchronised swimmers, a diver in Wellington boots and a rower were among the other inspirations for the designs.

The
Queen's Diamond Jubilee was also given recognition with a straw version
of the Queen, complete with a full-length gown and white gloves.

Locals in the village of Belbroughton,
Worcestershire, who entered the competition, showcased their work in 
their own gardens, which spectators were able to walk past and admire.

Every year one competitor is crowned winner.Â  Last year the winner was a scarecrow re-enactment of the Beatles' famous crossing of Abbey Road.

This year the wittiest, most original interpretations and best efforts from children were also awarded.

The money raised from the event, ran by volunteers from the village, is donated to charity and voluntary groups.
