Leader of the Commons William Hague unveiled plans aimed at delivering 'home rule' for England

Scottish nationalists will still be able to interfere in laws which don't apply north of the border - despite moves to introduce English votes for English laws, Tory backbenchers said today.

Under proposals put forward by William Hague, policies affecting England alone would be scrutinised by a panel made up only of MPs representing English seats.

A 'grand committee' of all English MPs would then have to approve the legislation.

But the proposals still allow Scottish MPs to block English-only laws at a final UK-wide vote.

Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said Mr Hague's plans needed to be 'strengthened'.

He said: 'It invites the SNP to come in and interfere with English laws and that might prove to be counter-productive. We will have to wait and see.'

Mr Redwood added: 'If you had a lot of Nationalist MPs, for example, who wanted something for Scotland then presumably they would all gang up and try to block an English proposal until we cave in.

'Far from keeping the Union together, as the minority of MPs think who want this proposal, it actually does more damage because it gives a battering ram against the Union to Nationalist MPs. It is a very, very dangerous thing to do.'

A large section of Tory backbenchers are angry at what they say is a watering down of David Cameron's promise to introduce English-votes-for-English-laws.

Barring Scottish MPs from voting on key affairs would permanently cripple Labour's influence at Westminster, given the party's reliance on the support of its 41 MPs north of the border. 

At the last election, the Conservatives won 296 of 533 MPs in England and would have had an overall majority of 59.

The last Labour government passed several key pieces of legislation – including that introducing foundation hospitals and tuition fees – thanks to the votes of Scottish MPs whose constituents were unaffected, given Holyrood's control of health and education policy.

Senior Conservatives insist Scottish MPs should be barred from determining laws that only affect England, given Scotland's new rights to determine its own affairs.

Mr Hague today outlined proposals for an English veto, which would apply to income tax, air passenger duty and other matters affecting only England.

The Conservatives want a new committee stage of legislation relating only to England, or only to England and Wales, would be considered only by MPs from those parts of the United Kingdom.

Crucially, those MPs would then have a veto over such legislation to prevent the wishes of the English or English and Welsh being overridden by Scottish MPs.

However, the legislation would still have to then clear a final hurdle of all MPs, as it does now, meaning Scottish MPs could attempt to throw out an entire Bill.

Mr Hague said: 'The Prime Minister and I have decided that the option we will put forward to Parliament and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to English MPs over matters only affecting England, or England and Wales, while maintaining the integrity of the United Kingdom Parliament. Both of these objectives are crucial, and both can be fulfilled by our chosen way forward.

'We Conservatives believe that this principle of English consent, the English veto should be extended to taxation when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to Scotland – and under a Conservative Government it will be.

'This is a fundamental matter of fairness. How could it possibly be right for the Scottish Parliament for example, to vote for a reduction in Air Passenger Duty in Scotland and then for Scottish MPs to come to Westminster and be able to impose an increase in Air Passenger Duty in England?

'You only have to think about this for a moment to see how fundamentally important this is and how such issues have to be addressed. Under our proposal this would not be possible without the agreement of English MPs.'

Mr Hague  rejected the argument that reform will weaken the UK, insisting: 'I say that failure to act would be the true weakening of the United Kingdom.'

Yesterday, Gordon Brown paved the way for a more generous benefits system in Scotland in a desperate bid to outflank the SNP on the left.

With panic sweeping through Scottish Labour amid fears of a general election wipe-out at the hands of Scottish Nationalists, the former Prime Minister yesterday unveiled plans to hand yet more powers to Holyrood.

In his first foray into the election campaign, Mr Brown said Labour wanted the Scottish Parliament to be able to make top-up payments to all benefit claimants if it wins the general election, raising the possibility of a higher state pension and more generous dole payments north of the border.

An academic report by Professor Richard Rose of the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at Strathclyde University yesterday predicted that David Cameron will remain in power because Labour will lose so many seats to the SNP.

The Nationalist threat is 'categorical', according to the findings, and could see the party win 45 of Scotland's 59 seats, leaving Labour with a rump of just ten Scots MPs.
