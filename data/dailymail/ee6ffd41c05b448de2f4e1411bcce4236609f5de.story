An Asian primary school teacher who cost taxpayers £300,000 after being off sick on full pay for six years lodged a complaint about stress just two months into her job, an employment tribunal heard today.

Anna Yerrakalva, 58, said her fellow teachers were racist, copied her Indian accent and gossiped about her almost immediately after she started work.

She told the Sheffield tribunal: 'During this time I was the only Asian or black employee at the school. As soon as I started working at the school I began to experience hostility towards me.

Anna Yerrakalva was off work from Dearne Carrfield Primary School in Bolton upon Dearne, South Yorkshire, for six years on full pay

'This involved hostile behaviour such as ignoring me, isolating me, whispering behind my back and mimicking my accent. This continued throughout the time I was employed at the school.'

After 14 months off sick with stress, she returned to work where two months later her teaching assistant had an epileptic fit and fell on top of her, pinning her to the floor.

She claimed to have suffered chest, neck and spine injuries as a result.

Mrs Yerrakalva, who had worked at Dearne Carrfield Primary School in Bolton upon Dearne, South Yorkshire, since April 2002, again went off sick after that alleged accident in November 2003.

She briefly returned, only to be struck by a bus in June 2004, and she has never worked since.

She was on full pay of about £30,000 a year until she was suspended last year – and was finally sacked in January 2010.

The teacher, who is reckoned to have cost the taxpayer a total of £300,000 in pay and legal costs over the six years, has taken her education authority to an employment tribunal, claiming victimisation and unfair dismissal.

Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council told the tribunal that Mrs Yerrakalva was fit enough to play badminton and go swimming despite receiving a disability living allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions.

But Mrs Yerrakalva, who uses a stick, told the hearing that her sporting prowess was a 'misunderstanding' and she could only walk a maximum of 50metres and was unable to negotiate stairs.

She insisted she be provided with a high table, special chair and interactive white board before she could return to teach the five-to-seven-year-old pupils.

The widow, who owns a second home in India, alleges unfair dismissal and is demanding 25 days extra pay from the local education authority after she withdrew an earlier accusation of race discrimination against the council.

She complained of racial discrimination in June 2002, and head teacher Stephen Poxton promised to investigate her complaints, but she went off sick with work related stress and didn't return until 11 September 2003.

Mrs Yerrakalva continued: 'In November 2003, I suffered an injury at work when my classroom assistant fell on me. I was as a result unfit to work.'

She told the head that she suffered chest, neck and spinal injuries after being crushed for 15 minutes beneath the classroom assistant.

Mrs Yerrakalva was referred to the Occupational Health Service and returned to school in April 2004, after she was deemed fit enough to work.

She told the tribunal: 'It was clear to me at that investigation meeting Mr Poxton did not believe my account of the accident.'

The tribunal previously heard that Mrs Yerrakalva claimed disability living allowance and industrial injury benefit in 2006 and 2007 saying she was severely disabled, yet at the same time she told her employers, Barnsley council, she was fit to return to work.

In a list of ailments detailed in her benefits claim forms, she said she suffered from dizzy spells and a lack of awareness and concentration.

She had frequent blackouts, a tendency to become confused and had fits of anger, often throwing things about.

The teacher claimed to have a problem with communicating and said she stumbled on a daily basis. She needed help with feeding, clothing and going to the toilet.

Mrs Yerrakalva also claimed she was unable to cope with the slightest changes in routine and quickly became aggressive when challenged.

To add to her list, she said she suffered from learning problems, panic attacks and a difficulty in filling in forms.

Head Mr Poxton pointed out to the tribunal these were hardly ideal attributes for a teacher.

He said: ‘Her claims caused a considerable amount of time, money and aggravation for the school and an irreparable breakdown of confidence. I could not trust this teacher with children.’

Mrs Yerrakalva, from Sheffield, argues she should have been allowed back to work.

The hearing continues.
