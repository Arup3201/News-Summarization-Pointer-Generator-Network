Disgraced former Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito has smashed his own Ferrari with a baseball bat in an apparent fit of rage.

Police went to the sportsman's home in Scottsdale, Arizona, after a neighbour called to report that his $300,000 car had been damaged.

Officers found that Incognito and the car were missing. When they later called to ask if he wanted to report a crime, he confessed that he did the damage himself.

Richie Incognito has confessed to damaging his own $300,000 Ferrari with a baseball bat

Officers were called to the sportsman's home after a neighbour reported the damage, but found the troubled player wasn't home. When they called him later he said he'd caused the damage himself

This unexplained attack, first reported by TMZ, is just the latest bizarre outburst by Incognito following allegations that he led a bullying ring while playing for the Dolphins which forced tackle Johnathan Martin out of the team.

On Friday a report was released which named him as a bullying ringleader within the Dolphins' locker room, prompting a Twitter rant from Incognito that he couldn't be defined 'in 144 years let alone 144 pages.'

He also criticised former teammate Martin, saying the report would 'bury' the claims against him.

However, on Monday and Tuesday night 
he returned to the social networking site to 'apologize for acting like a
 big baby the last few days,' adding that 'This has all been so much on 
me and my family. I just want to play football.'

Incognito also changed tack with Martin by calling him his 'brother' and saying 'no hard feelings'.

Last week, after a report was published naming Incognito as the figurehead of the alleged bullying ring, Incognito launched into a Twitter rant before apologising to teammates and coaches

Last week, the investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe.

The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults.

Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October.

They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough.

Incognito's attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report 'replete with errors' and said that Martin 'was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.'Â
