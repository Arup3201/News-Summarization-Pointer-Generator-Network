BBC presenter Louise Minchin told how she is at the bottom of the pecking order of the 10 o'clock news presenters.

The Breakfast show host said that Huw Edwards is at the very top followed by Fiona Bruce, George Alagiah, Sophie Raworth and then the rest.

And she admitted she would never have got the Breakfast presenting job if Sian Williams had moved North from London to MediaCity in Salford.

The 44-year-old, who has moved to Chester along with her husband David and their daughters Mia, 11, and Scarlett, eight, told Cheshire Life magazine: 'I remember the first time I presented the 10 o'clock news.

'It was terrifying. There is a pecking order. Huw Edwards is at the top, then Fiona, George and Sophie. And then there are the rest of us.

'It was my night on and it just so happened that all of the big presenters were at a party with the boss.

'I turned the news on and Saddam Hussein had been hanged. This was the first time I was doing the 10 o'clock news and it was one of the biggest stories of the century. 

'I kept thinking, with minutes to go, that Huw would walk in and save the day. But he didn't, and I did it. There were 7.5million viewers. That certainly got my heart racing.'

The BBC’s move to Media City in Salford Quays has been riddled with controversy, with many presenters refusing to move.

BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins both refused to make the change and as a result were replaced.

Mrs Minchin added: 'I love my job and I know I'm really lucky. I'm very aware that if Sian Williams had decided to move I wouldn't have this job. But I'm enjoying every minute of BBC Breakfast and our new life in Cheshire. I've always had a yearning to live in the country so this makes sense.'

In a move costing an estimated £1.5billion, the BBC relocated thousands of staff across five departments including Sport, Children’s and Radio 5 Live to the Media City site in Salford earlier this year.

BBC Breakfast made its Salford debut in April, while Blue Peter and Match of the Day are among the programmes which air from the futuristic complex.

Last month it emerged that filming of BBC Breakfast’s ‘light news’ slot could be returned to the capital after concerns that its live guests are not of a high enough calibre.

It was revealed in July that the show, hosted by Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid, was forced to conduct 12 interviews via video link in one week because guests were based in London.
