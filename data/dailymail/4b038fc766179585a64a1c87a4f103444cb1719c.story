The Ministry of Defence was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal.

In the last year alone the MoD paid out £13.5million in compensation to civilian staff – which amounts to almost a third of the £45million given to serving soldiers.

It means that for every £3,000 paid  to injured soldiers the government handed £1,000 to MoD bureaucrats for office falls, according to the figures released under freedom of information rules.

While soldiers in Afghanistan have risked their lives fighting the Taliban, MoD staff stationed in the UK are constantly being carted off to hospital for trips, falls, crashes and bizarre health and safety incidents.

Soldiers, pictured attending the annual Irish Guards St Patrick's Day Parade in Aldershot this week, have received £45million in compensation last year - but another £13.5million was paid to bureaucrats

The details of the catalogue of mishaps to befall military personnel in the UK were revealed by safety officers who have had to record all serious incidents for the Health and Safety Executive.

Although there were parachuting, roping and other training course injuries sustained by military personnel last year there were also a host of more mundane office based accidents.

In one, a man rushed back into his office to answer the phone on his desk only to trip over a hidden vacuum cleaner.

The person smashed into a rubbish bin and their office chair and needed a week off work to recover from the injuries.

Another person was walking out of a meeting when they were distracted by a colleague and ended up walking into a wall and breaking their wrist.

One person hurt their back when the legs on the right side of their chair snapped off sending the person toppling onto the floor.

In a similar incident a roller came off one of the legs of a moveable office chair sending the person who was sitting in it crashing to the floor.

A member of the public who was visiting a recreation of a World War I trench ended up in hospital with a gash to their head when they stood on a crate to get a view over the top and toppled back over.

In a separate case a group of cadets were injured when the camping gas canister they were using to cook a meal exploded, leaving one girl with bad burns.

Another MOD worker was off work for more than a month after they injured their bladder in a slip on the newly cleaned floor of the office toilets, while a dog handler suffered bad cuts after trying to separate a fight between two military dogs.

All the incidents were recorded on RIDDOR forms which the Health and Safety Executive make organisations fill out when there has been a serious injury in the workplace or a dangerous incident that could have led to an accident.

An MOD spokesperson said: 'MOD has a duty of care to all its employees whether military or civilian personnel.

'Claims brought for civil damages are considered on the basis of complex legal liability and where liability is proved compensation is paid but we robustly resist spurious claims.

'The amount of compensation is determined by common law principles and payments are often made to those who have suffered the most severe injuries in the course of their work.'
