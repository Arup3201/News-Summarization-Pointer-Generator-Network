News flash: Presidents' Day is not a real holiday.

The official name of the third Monday in February given off to federal and other employees is actually Washington's Birthday.

But car dealers and other retails are too busy trying to figure out how to spell Presidents' Day in their promotional campaigns to notice.

Big day for car dealers: Car dealerships around the country are celebrating Washington's Birthday in their own special way

Good for business: Dealerships are using the federal holiday to lure customers on their day off and launch their spring auto sales lines

Salespeople around the country have 
latched onto the federal holiday to lure customers on their day off and 
launch their spring auto lines.

The date of the annual federal holiday meant to commemorate the nation's first president was established by Congress with the Monday Holidays Act, which went into effect in 1971.

But local car dealerships around the country found an additional use for Washington's Birthday soon after and began promoting the name as synonymous with savings, according to the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

Department stores and other retailers also began to use the annual holiday to attract customers and promote sales over the three-day weekend.

Local mom and pop shops and big chain stores, such as Macy's and Bed, Bath & Beyond, offer special 'Presidents' Day sales' year after year to get the most out of people's spare time.

America, after all, is the land of free enterprise.

One small challenge for dealerships and retailers, though, is figuring out how to properly spell the holiday’s name in their promotional campaigns depending on which state they are in.

That has created a potential business opportunity for other companies.

One website, Geometrx, which sells territory mapping software and demographic data, examined the official holiday calendars for all 50 states, to see which states call the holiday ‘Presidents’ Day,’ ‘President’s Day,’ ‘Presidents Day,’ ‘Washington’s Birthday,’ or something else.

Geometrx’s findings show that about 16 
states celebrate Presidents Day and another 15 states celebrate 
Washington’s Birthday, while nine states don’t observe a holiday on the 
third Monday in February.

The other states celebrate a holiday that includes the words ‘President’, ‘Washington’, ‘Lincoln’, ‘Thomas Jefferson’, and ‘Daisy Gatson Bates’, in some combination, according to the site’s results.

The continual rise in online car sales and fixed pricing may have taken some of the wind out of the sales hype for Washington’s Birthday, the NCC notes.

But it’s still a big deal for the business.
