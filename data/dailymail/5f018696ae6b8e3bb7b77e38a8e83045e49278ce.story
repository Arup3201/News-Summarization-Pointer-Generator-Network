What a difference a week makes. Seven days after we were basking in temperatures of up to 72F (22C) on Bank Holiday Monday, Britain is set for rain, strong winds and thunderstorms.

The country will be battered by 40mph gales today, with the mercury plunging below the May average of 60F (15C), according to the Met Office.

A brolly will come in handy tomorrow when almost an inch (20mm) of rain is expected to fall in the south in just 12 hours.

Sunny Sunday: Don't be fooled by today's good weather. Forecasters say it won't last and the coming weather holds prospects of strong rain and wind

The cherry blossoms have a short flowering season. Today's warm weather is not set to stay, according to forecasters

Wet and windy weather is due to arrive tomorrow. Joggers and dog walkers have taken advantage of today's sunny spell

The weather will then revert to a mix of downpours and sunshine. Met Office forecaster Emma Compton said: ‘Over the next five days we will have unsettled weather with temperatures below average.’

She added: ‘It’ll be much wetter on Wednesday with no sun, but more rain in the south east and in the rest of the UK.

‘Thursday and Friday will be pretty unremarkable with rain spreading across the country.’London could see highs of just 57F (14C).

The sun shone on a carpet of bluebells in Oxfordshire today. However, there are signs that a wet Summer is in store

These scenes are a world away from the wind and rain of last week, and the blustery weather to come tomorrow

Blustery: Fierce winds are said to be on their way, because of the position of the Jet Stream

Deserted: Britain's beaches were packed last Bank Holiday Monday, but the weather has since taken a turn for the worse

Met Office forecaster Reid Morrison said: 'Unsettled weather ahead is due to the jet stream being further south 
than normal, allowing low pressure systems to track across the UK rather
than further north.

'It certainly looks like the jet stream will remain further south than normal for the next nine days.

'Last summer’s unsettled weather was also due to the jet stream being further south than normal.'

Last year's record breaking downpours made it the wettest Summer in England and Wales in 100 years.

The jet stream's southerly position is said to have caused the freak downpours. Forecasters warn a similar pattern is developing now.

MeteoGroup forecaster Nick Prebble said: 'Low pressure normally passes north-west of the UK, but high pressure is
expected north-east of the UK next week, with the jet stream moving 
south towards the Bay of Biscay.

Be prepared: Carrying an umbrella for the rest of the month is advised, after forecasters release grim predictions for May

Braving the rain: The Queen sheltered from the rain in a hooded raincoat at the Royal Windsor Horse Show this week

'This is expected to be the catalyst
for low pressure passing over central or southern parts, with the 
tendency for more widespread rain.

'The jet stream can get stuck in a rut, as with the awful weather last summer when it was further south than normal.”

Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather Outlook said there is potential for 'Rain, some heavy with an increased risk of flooding, and stronger winds.

He said: 'The festival season could be affected and this needs watching, with events including Glastonbury not too far ahead now.'
