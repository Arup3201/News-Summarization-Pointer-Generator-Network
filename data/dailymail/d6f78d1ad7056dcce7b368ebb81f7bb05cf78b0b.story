A former Playboy Playmate turned trainee teacher has been threatened with the sack after she missed the start of term because she injured her back on a television shoot.

Former Miss Vienna Doris Kemptner, 25, was censured by Austrian school officials when she failed to return to school in time after filming steamy reality show 'Rendezvous in Paradise' on France's Cote d'Azur.

Miss Kemptner told her bosses she had hurt her spine in the program, where 11 women compete for the attention of just two men.

But news of her absence sparked fury in the Austrian capital Vienna, where local politicians received hundreds of letters and emails about her failure to show up for work.

In a series of emails from angry members of the public, the Vienna Schools Council was urged to investigate allegations the model had been 'cheating the taxpayer'.

One wrote: 'Taking part in this sort of programme just proves that she is everything a teacher should not be.'

Popular with the boys: Miss Kemptner, who has a master's degree in philosophy, psychology and nutrition, was Playmate of the Month in April 2009. She graced the front cover of Dutch Playboy in March 2012

But curvy Miss Kemptner - who has a degree in philosophy, psychology and nutrition sciences from the University of Vienna - has vowed to fight the knockers. 

She said: 'In fact, I only missed four hours of school because the doctor had told me I shouldn't fly.'

She added: 'I don't know why I was attacked like this. But I suppose there will always be those who are envious.'
