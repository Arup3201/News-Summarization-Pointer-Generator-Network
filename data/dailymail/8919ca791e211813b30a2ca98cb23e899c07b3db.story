The omission of Joan Rivers from the In Memoriam segment of Sunday night’s Oscars caused uproar among fans on social media within moments of the segment being aired.

Although Joan wasn’t an Oscar-winning actress or filmmaker, she was unquestionably an influential woman in Academy Awards history.

The 81-year-old actress, comedian, and TV host died suddenly on September 4 from complications during surgery.

Snub: Comedian and TV host Joan Rivers was left out of the 2015 Academy Awards In Memoriam segment

Joan Rivers' acting roles included voicing the gold robot Dot Matrix in 1987's Spaceballs, while Elaine Stritch, right, was another showbiz legend missing from the In Memoriam segment

The next say the Academy responded.

'Joan Rivers is among the many worthy artists and filmmakers we were unfortunately unable to feature in the In Memoriam segment of this year’s Oscar show,' a rep for the Academy told The Hollywood Reporter.

'She is, however, included in our In Memoriam gallery on Oscar.com.' 

According to a Monday post from TMZ, daughter Melissa isn't too happy. 'She feels her mom deserved a place in the In Memoriam portion of the Oscars, but she's not going to focus on the snub,' a source told the site. 

While Joan's movie career wasn't of the type usually honoured by the Oscars - she tended to show up mostly in comedic cameos in movies including The Muppets Take Manhattan, Spaceballs, and The Smurfs - her mark on the ceremony itself was huge.

Joan began hosting the E! network's pre-Academy Awards red carpet with daughter Melissa Rivers in 1995, a job she continued through 2014.

Other snubs included Taylor Negron, left in The Last Boy Scout, and SNL alum Jan Hooks, right as Hillary Clinton

According to Vanity Fair, the Rivers women 'revolutionized the red carpet - from a runway with little celebrity-reporter interaction - into its own brand of entertainment.'

She also wrote and directed 1978's Rabbit Test, while Maya Angelou was included despite only directing one film (1998's Down in the Delta).

Joan's omission from the tribute section of the Academy Awards immediately stirred up a passionate reaction on Twitter.

'No Joan Rivers? Tacky to say the least,' tweeted Ryan Parker.

Tacky: Fans quickly took to Twitter to protest the 'tacky' omission of Joan

Colleagues: Sally Jessy Raphael, a TV-host colleague of Joan's, tweeted quickly in indignation

Anger: Some Twitter users grew angry about the snub

Jokes: In Joan's style, some protested with the use of humour

Missing: From the beginning of the show, some missed Joan's signature style on the red carpet

Talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael chimed in as well: 'No mention of @Joan_Rivers in the Memorial?! That's not right.'

'#Oscars feels wrong w/out #JoanRivers. Bummed the Academy didn't include the red carpet queen during the In Memoriam,' wrote Matt Whitfield.

Some fans on social media at least found a little dark comedy in the situation.

'Joan Rivers is gonna surprise us after the commercial break by being alive, I guess,' wrote Shalyah Evans.

Complaints about In Memoriam snubs have been around just about as long as the segment itself and Joan wasn’t the only surprising snub in the 2015 version.

Introduction: Frequent Oscar nominee Meryl Streep introduced the always sad segment

Tributes: While Joan was left out, film-making luminaries like Robin Williams, Malik Bendjelloul, Ruby Dee, and more were mentioned

Broadway legend and comedienne Elaine Stritch had appeared in films including A Farewell To Arms and Monster-In-Law.

Taylor Negron had been a character actor of some note with memorable roles in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Last Boy Scout.

Another missing name was Jan Hooks, an SNL alum who appeared in Batman Returns, Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Coneheads.

Others on social media complained that writer-director-actor Harold Ramis had also been left out, but the Ghostbusters - who star passed away in early 2014 – had been included in last year's Oscars ceremony.

Those who were mentioned in the tribute, introduced by Meryl Streep, included Robin Williams, Mike Nichols, Mickey Rooney, Lauren Bacall, James Garner, Ruby Dee, Luise Rainer and Maya Angelou.

After the photo tributes finished, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson sang.

Music: After the memorial pictures were shown, Jennifer Hudson performed
