The girlfriend of a man who went missing after a Christmas night out almost ten days ago has made a video plea for him to come home. 

Patrick Lamb, 28, was last seen at about 12.30am on December 13 after a night out in Bar Chocolate in Maidstone, Kent.

Specialist police divers have been searching the River Medway in Kent but have so far found nothing to suggest he was there.

Natasha Morgan, 28, has made a tearful video pleading with her boyfriend Patrick Lamb, 28, to return home after he went missing following a Christmas night out in Maidstone in Kent almost 10 days ago

Natasha Morgan, 28, has uploaded a video to YouTube and set up a website in a bid for Mr Lamb to come home. 

In the video Natasha is close to tears throughout the minute-long clip as she begs her boyfriend to make contact.

She tells him: 'Pat, if you're listening, I love you so much. Please come home to me.

'It doesn't what's happened or if you feel embarrassed or if you think you've done something wrong. It really doesn't matter.

'You know I forgive everything anyway. I love you much and I just need you safe.

'I need your help with everything. I need you in my life, I need you to look after me. Please let me look after you now.

In the video Miss Morgan pleads with her boyfriend to come home and says she will forgive him for anything 

Specialist police diving teams have been searching the River Medway but found nothing on Friday 

'Please come home, please don't do anything. I love you so much.'

Miss Morgan, a retail manager and dancer, said Mr Lamb, a broadcast engineer, would be unlikely to leave his two year-old nephew Harry Lamb who is currently suffering with leukaemia.

She said she is worried her boyfriend has died but has made the video because there are no clues in the investigation.

Police flew over a specialist sonar device from Ireland to scan the river for any signs of Mr Lamb, who lives in Greenhithe, Kent. Divers went in after an area of interest was indicated, but found nothing.

Miss Morgan said her partner has never disappeared before and she cannot imagine him leaving his nephew 

Mr Lamb's mother Sharon Lamb (left), Zoe Lamb (centre) and Michael Lamb (right) have put up posters and distributed flyers around Maidstone in Kent  for help tracing 28-year-old Mr Lamb, a broadcast engineer

His family have also put up posters all over Kent and launched a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #findpatlamb.

'I don't feel he's gone off anywhere, he's never done anything like that before, but you have to cover all your bases,' she added. 

'At the moment police are going through CCTV, but we've heard nothing for over a week. I'm so frightened he's dead.

'But the fact that nothing was found in the river is hopeful.

'At the moment we are all totally clueless as to what might have happened but I'm hoping the video may make a bit of difference, I have to do something.

'If he is alive I'm hoping the video will make him realise he will come home and everything will be OK.

Mr Lamb's family are  trying to trace him and said they are pleased the river search returned nothing

Search and rescue teams were looking along the River Medway for signs Mr Lamb had fallen in the river 

Friends of Mr Lamb said the negative search had given them hope and they remained positive

Kent Police searched the river on Friday and brought in a specialist search dog to look for the 28-year-old 

'If he has done something that I or his family don't know about then we just want to let him know that he can come home and he doesn't have to be embarrassed or afraid, whatever that might be.

'It would be wonderful to have him home for Christmas.' 

Mr Lamb's mother Sharon, 57, father Tony, 65, sister Zoe, 20, and his four brothers are helping with the search.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'It continues as a missing person enquiry and we are still investigating.

'We've got lots of CCTV so we are going through that and last week we search the river Medway.'

Zoe Lamb has posted missing persons photos in Gabriels Hill in Maidstone in Kent, hoping to find her brother

A specialist search dog from NSARDA (National Search & Rescue Dog Association) was also being used today to search in areas inaccessible to people.

A spokesperson for Kent Search and Rescue said: 'We have got a search dog out at the moment.

'It has been out since 7.30am and will continue to search throughout the day. We will be heading down to the hotel where Pat was meant to be staying.

'We have also had teams analysing over 500 photos that were obtained from the spotter plane. We have picked out anything in the images that is unusual and going back to that point.

'Search boats will also be back on the water later today.'
