Montpellier was underwater today as devastating flash floods created a ‘natural disaster’ across the south of France.

The city, which is hugely popular with British expatriates and tourists, was hit with almost 10 inches of rain in just over three hours on Monday.

By 8pm, up to 12 inches of rain had fallen – almost 50 per cent of Montpellier’s average rainfall for the entire year.

It meant canoes were out in force on the streets, as numerous roads were blocked and public transport was suspended.

The town’s airport was also hit, with all approach roads submerged – leaving hundreds stranded.

Around 4000 people had to be taken into emergency centres overnight across the Herault department, as Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve declared a ‘natural disaster’.

He said ‘all forces available will be mobilised’ to rescue people, and to care for particularly vulnerable members of society including the old and the very ill.

Around 4,000 people had to be taken to emergency centres, like the Zenith, pictured, and 1,000 firemen were drafted in to help with evacuations

Local mayor Philippe Saurel said more than 1000 firemen were being drafted into the area from other parts of the country to deal with evacuations.

The exceptionally heavy rain caused the river Lez to burst its banks, causing chaos in dozens of towns and villages nearby. Some 22 major roads were blocked in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, of which Montpellier is the capital.

There included the A75 autoroute,which links the city of Clermont-Ferrand with the Mediterranean coast.

Meteo-France, the weather agency, issued a rare red alert for flooding and heavy rainfall, warning that it was likely to continue.

Last week, severe weather left four people dead in the south of France, when they were swept away in raging flood waters which hit camp sites.
