Killer: Taped conversations between Mohamed Merah and police negotiators have been leaked to a French TV station

Toulouse terrorist Mohamed Merah told police he would keep on killing and that he 'loved death more than they loved life' as he was hiding under siege in his flat, it has emerged.

Taped exchanges between the Al Qaeda-inspired gunman and police reveal he also said he had not planned on being caught and 'was ready for all of the tactics negotiators would try'.

The chilling words, recorded during a 32-hour stand-off at his apartment after he killed seven people, were broadcast on French national television station TF1 yesterday.

Their airing has sparked outrage from relatives of the victims, and an investigation into how the audio was obtained has also now been launched.

In the clips, the 23-year-old can be heard defying the police and declaring he was not afraid to die. Merah eventually died in a shootout as police tried to storm his apartment.

He said: 'I know that there's a chance you could kill me, that's a risk I'm taking. So there we are, know that you are up against a man who is not afraid of death.'

After his first two attacks on March 11 and March 15 left three French uniformed soldiers dead, Mohamed Merah shot and killed Rabbi Jonathan Sandler.

He also gunned down his two young sons Gavriel and Aryeh, and another young girl, Miriam Monsonego, outside the Ozar Hatorah school on March 19.

He also told negotiators he wanted to carry out more attacks on sites he happened upon, as he did the Jewish school. He said: 'I would leave everything to chance and proceed without any preparation.'

And he revealed his 'goal in these attacks was to kill soldiers engaged in Afghanistan, and all manner of their allies, be it the police, gendarmerie, everything.'

Of the school shooting, he said: 'I took the scooter and I went just like that, it was not premeditated. At the end of the day it was my intention, but the morning when I woke up it was not my objective.'

Interior Minister Manuel Valls condemned the broadcast of the extracts in a statement issued shortly after the programme aired.

Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah

He regretted it had come at a time when court proceedings relating to the killings were still ongoing and said it showed a lack of respect to relatives of the victims.

The police unit responsible for internal investigations, the IGPN, would be launching an investigation, the interior ministry added.

Emmanuel Chain, the producer of 'Sept a Huit', the programme that broadcast the extracts, defended decision to run the tapes, said it had a 'high news value'.

He added: 'We acted responsibly. We learn how Merah trained with Al Qaeda, his determination. We learn a lot of things, it has been very much put in context.'

It was precisely because they had the feelings of relatives of the victims in mind that they had decided not to run other parts of the tape, he added.

But a lawyer for relatives of Imad Ibn Ziaten, the first soldier killed by Merah, said he had filed a complaint for violation of the secrecy of an investigation and receipt of stolen goods.

'The family is outraged, because these murders are not a show and the documents are part of judicial proceedings,' said Mohan Mouhou, who represents the victim's parents.

Samia Maktouf, another lawyer representing relatives of those killed, said they would go to court to get an order banning any further broadcast of the tapes on any medium.

She said: 'The victims are outraged to learn the contents of these negotiations on television.

'At this rate, the videos of the killings will end up on the Web and the damage then will be irreversible.'

Merah filmed his killings and in March the pan-Arab television channel al-Jazeera received a copy on a USB memory key at its Paris bureau.

The channel decided not to run the footage and the main French television networks also said they would not run the material if it became available.
