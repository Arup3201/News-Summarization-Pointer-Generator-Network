Sir John Major who has argued that the Scottish Government should be handed wide-ranging powers in a bid to curb enthusiasm for the 'folly' of full independence

Stopping Scottish independence is more important than re-electing David Cameron  to safeguard Britain's 'special relationship' with the US, former Tory Prime Minister John Major has claimed.

Sir John said Scottish independence would force Britain to give up its nuclear weapons - sparking a diplomatic crisis with Washington.

It would also increase demands for independence in Wales and Northern Ireland and diminish the UK's influence in the world, Sir John said.

He claimed the 2015 general election was one of the most important since Margaret Thatcher was first elected - but pales in comparison to keeping the union together.

The former Tory leader said 'I don’t wish to disparage the importance of the 2015 General Election at all – it is one of the more important elections we’ve had in the last 30 years or so. But it is less important than maintaining the United Kingdom as an entity.'

He said: 'Of course, one of the big implications of Scotland becoming separate would be the SNP's threat to expel Trident from Faslane.

Sir John said this would 'in effect, be the end of the serious British nuclear deterrent'. Sir John said 'you can't just move those subs, they need proper ports, they need proper facilities'.

He added: 'You're talking of many, many years before they would have them, by which time Trident may no longer be as relevant as it is now. And that affects not just us, that affects every European country and Nato.

'How will the United States react when one of the only two countries with a credible military and nuclear capability suddenly has the nuclear capability effectively wrecked?

'This affects the United Kingdom. It affects our security. There are long-term, strategic questions for the whole of the United Kingdom that depend upon the result of this referendum.'

Yesterday, Sir John said: 'America would not forgive - nor forget - this, and yet the separatists assume membership of NATO is almost a given. Trust me, it is far from that.'

The former Prime Minister said the UK cannot be ‘broken apart without damaging repercussions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland – some unforeseen, some unforeseeable’.

He said: 'If Scotland were to become a separate country that would have serious implications, I believe, for Scotland, and negative implications.

'But it would also have very negative implications for the rest of the United Kingdom as well.

'If, for example, you see a country begin to fracture, does it have greater or lesser influence over its international bodies, in the European Union, in the United Nations, in the G7, in any of the international groupings? Self-evidently they have less.

'If you have Scotland deciding to be independent, what does that actually do inside the rest of the United Kingdom?

'Does that inflame a greater independence demand in Wales, for example, and it has implications in every part of the UK. We would be weaker.  

Alex Salmond's hopes of winning the September 18 referendum hinge on convincing undecided voters to back independence. Among those certain to vote the 'no' campaign currently enjoys a 20 per cent lead 

Sir John, now 71, also accused Alex Salmond of trying to capitalise on ‘anti-English sentiment’ and the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn ahead of September’s independence referendum.

In his first key intervention in the debate over Scotland’s future, the former Prime Minister said he was ‘sad’ the 700th anniversary of Robert the Bruce’s famous victory over the English will be commemorated just months before voters go to the polls.

The ex-Tory leader said English voices should be ‘heard with respect, and without the petulant name-calling that has been the response to some English interventions during this campaign so far’.

Sir John added: 'We were at war centuries ago, which – if I may be brutally frank – I find it rather sad that the SNP chose the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn for the vote, presumably to maximise the opportunity for any anti-English sentiment that may exist.'

The Bannockburn commemorations take place next week, around 80 days before Scots go to the polls.

Sir John claimed Scotland would go from having ‘real influence’ as part of the United Kingdom to ‘irrelevance’ as a small nation if people vote ‘Yes’ on September 18.

He accused Alex Salmond of trying to capitalise on ‘anti-English sentiment’, and called on him to crack down on Nationalist ‘trolls’ abusing people on Twitter for supporting the Union.

As Prime Minister Sir John blocked demands in Scotland for devolution over fears it would be used as a 'stepping stone' to independence. Ironically the SNP leader Alex Salmond (sat with Sir John at Wimbledon last year) was also against devolution - because he believed it would stop voters pushing for independence

Sir John, also rubbished Mr Salmond’s claims that an independent Scotland could join the European Union, calling it ‘fatuous’ and said it could require years of painstaking negotiations and concessions.

After Harry Potter author JK Rowling was subjected to vile online abuse for giving money to the Better Together campaign: Sir John said: ‘If Alex Salmond cannot control these people, and perhaps he can’t, then he can at least disown them. And he should.’

Last night, SNP MSP Stewart Maxwell said: ‘John Major is just about the last person the No campaign will have wanted to see entering the debate here, given his track record in ensuring a Tory wipe-out in Scotland in 1997.’
