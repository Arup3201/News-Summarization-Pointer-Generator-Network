Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer insists Alan Pardew was right to call time on his St James' Park career in favour of a move to Crystal Palace.

Pardew won his first game in charge of the Eagles against Conference side Dover on Sunday after bringing an end to his four-year spell on Tyneside.

The 53-year-old's decision to move to south London was questioned in some quarters but Shearer believes Pardew has plenty of good reasons for choosing a return to Selhurst Park.

In an interview with the BBC, Toon legend Shearer said: 'It did make me laugh when I heard people saying that Alan wouldn't leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace.

'There's a million reasons why Alan would leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace – he'd be on a better salary at a football club where the fans would want him, he would buy and sell the players he wanted.

'There's three or four very, very good reasons to start with.'

Pardew was on a long-term contract at St James' Park but Shearer, who is the Magpies' top scorer of all time, thinks that owner Mike Ashley may have had a say in his departure.

Asked about Ashley's intentions for Newcastle, Shearer said: 'I don't know (what they are) because he never tells us anything.

'He doesn't speak to anyone, but there's a small part of me that thinks he might have given Alan Pardew a nod.'
