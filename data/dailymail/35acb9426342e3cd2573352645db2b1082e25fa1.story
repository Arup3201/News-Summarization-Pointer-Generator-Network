For people sick and tired of stepping in doggie dung left by where it lays by their neighbors, a canine DNA company offers a service that tracks down the offending owner.

It’s called PooPrints and the company markets to apartment complexes, condo buildings, and other communities where not-so-conscientious residents leave behind their pet’s waste.

The service works by requiring residents of participating buildings to register their dog’s unique genetic signature in a worldwide database.

Gum swab: Residents in participating communities must submit samples of their pet's DNA, as collected with a quick swab of the gums

Dragnet: Apartment managers, for instance, can use PooPrints to gather evidence left behind be offending residents

Using a designated PooPrints 
collection kit, groundskeepers and apartment managers can gather the 
evidence and send it off to PooPrints parent company, BioPet Vet Lab in 
Knoxville, Tennessee.

At
Knoxville, Tennessee-based BioPet Vet Lab, parent company of PooPrints,
scientists test the DNA against all registered dogs to determine if a 
particular pile comes from one of a community’s dogs.

It’s billed as a money-saving way for groups to cut down on excess excrement, protecting the environment and shoe soles alike.

Opinions of the service, which requires upfront fees from resident dog owners and sometimes monthly fees thereafter, aren’t all positive.

Dallas tenant Brian Barcus told said he’s unhappy with his building’s decision to contract with PooPrints.

‘Everybody wants to live in a clean community,’ Barcus told the Houston Chronicle. ‘I can see the intent behind the new rule, but I don't understand how they can force it upon us in the middle of our lease.’

Barcus said it’s unfair that this new requirement comes after he unsuccessfully tried to break his lease following a burglary.

Others, such as property managers, see it as a good way to keep their grounds clean.

Worldwide: PooPrints has a worldwide DNA database from its franchise locations across the US, and in Canada, Israel, and Singapore

‘I think it's a great idea,’ 
Houston-area leasing manager Molly Kalish said. ‘The main reason we 
decided to try this new program was because we had a specific issue on 
one of our floors with accidents.’

Kalish’s building receives their services through area franchise PooPrints Gulf Coast.

The franchise locations sell the DNA collection kits, sample collection kits,  and collect the processing fees for BioPet Vet Lab’s DNA testing.

Even if you among those who think PooPrints sounds like a load of horse manure, there’s no denying the company has achieved respectable success.

On their website, PooPrint boasts distributors in over a dozen US states, two in Canada, and one in both Israel and Singapore.
