A woman teacher died after taking a cocktail of drugs at a nightclub called Six Feet Under, an inquest heard.

Mother-of-one Sarah Mayhew, 30, suffered a heart attack in the nightclub car park after having a fatal reaction to the party drugs.

Miss Mayhew took a cocktail of all three drugs in her hotel room with friends before going to the Six Feet Under nightclub.

The secondary school teacher had taken a combination of ecstasy, cocaine and mephedrone known as meow, meow.

Police Inspector Denis Lewis told the inquest that the single mother became 'very ill' inside the club.

But he said there were no signs she had been forced to take any of the drugs.

A post mortem examination found her death was caused by a combination of mephedrone and ecstacy toxicity.

An inquest heard Miss Mayhew travelled from her home city of Bristol to Newport, South Wales, to meet her boyfriend at a Travelodge in the city.

Gwent Coroner's Court heard levels of the drugs found were consistent with recreational use and that alcohol levels found in her body were 'negligible'.

A pathologist report said the combined effect of the drugs was the reason for her death in the early hours of September 30 last year.

Coroner David Bowen recorded a verdict of misadventure.

He said: 'I am satisfied she voluntarily ingested drugs and she did not intend or foresee the tragic circumstances of those actions.'

Miss Mayhew, who had an eight-year-old son Connor, was Head of House at King's Oak Academy, in Kingswood, Gloucestershire.

The secondary school has earned specialist Mathematics and Computing college status and teaches 712 children aged between 11 and 18.

Dozens of students left tributes to the popular teacher on Facebook following her sudden death.

teacher that everyone looked up to and she never stopped smiling.

'She always wanted the best for her students.'

Former student Georgia May said: 'You were the only teacher who would actually sit down and listen to my problems.

'Whenever I needed someone you were always there and you got me through half of my GCSEs.

'You made me keep my head down and always showed me the right directions in life.'
