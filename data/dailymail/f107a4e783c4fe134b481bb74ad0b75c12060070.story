* With Nico Rosberg second at Suzuka, Mercedes have eight one-two finishes this season, drawing them alongside Mansell and Riccardo Patrese from their time at Renault in 1991-92. There are five other partnerships ahead, led by Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello with 24.

* Mercedes may even set a new record for most wins in a season. The current mark is 15 held jointly by Ferrari (twice in 2002 and 2004), and McLaren in 1988. Mercedes have 12 with four races remaining.

* The Sochi Autodrom is the newest venue to join the F1 calendar, with the track winding its way through the site that hosted the Winter Olympics earlier this year.

* The organisers are proudly boasting it to be the only track in the world to be located in an Olympic venue, and the only one to be both permanent and a street circuit as it integrates into Sochi's general infrastructure during non-racing periods.

* At 5.853km in length, it is the third longest circuit on the current calendar behind Silverstone (5.891km) and Spa (7.004km).

* Although a street circuit, cars are expected to hit speeds of 320kmh on the main straight between turns one and two.
