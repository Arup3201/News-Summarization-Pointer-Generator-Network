Anguish: Many computer users are receiving messages which falsely accuse them of using vile websites

Innocent internet users are  being blackmailed by hackers who are infecting their computers with  a virus that displays a fake message accusing them of watching child pornography.  

The virus, known as ‘Kovter’, uses imitation logos that appear to belong to authorities such as the Metropolitan Police and other forces.

It then holds the bewildered computer user to ransom and says that unless payments of £100 to £300 are made, legal action will be taken.

The National Crime Agency – Britain’s FBI – last night urged victims not to pay the ransom and to contact Action Fraud, the UK’s internet  misuse reporting centre.

The virus, thought to have been developed by Eastern European gangs, is part of a new wave of  ‘ransomware’, in which hackers masquerade as authorities in order to extort money.

A typical fake warning reads: ‘Such actions, in whole or in part, violate Protection of Children Act 1978 Possession s160 Criminal  Justice Act 1998.’

In extreme cases, the victim’s screen freezes and becomes locked on the home page of a pornographic website, or indecent images of children appear on the screen.

Action Fraud said it had received 134 reports of viruses which reference child pornography in the past six months, but it is believed that many cases go unreported.

Many of those targeted have never visited illegal or pornographic sites and experts believe that because victims are so embarrassed by the warning, many do not report it.

One victim, targeted by hackers who used a Metropolitan Police logo, said he initially failed to report it because he was embarrassed, even though he had never downloaded any illegal material.

The lorry driver from Cheshire  added: ‘It looked convincing. There was a big list of everything you could possibly do wrong on a computer and it said you have done one of these things, ranging from child porn to downloading music illegally.’

Researchers from security firm  Damballa say that the number of cases seen globally each day has risen from an average of 9,783 in April 2014 to 24,825 per day in May but could not give UK figures.

Adrian Culley, a former cybercrime detective with the Met, said he had advised individuals and companies on porn ransom attacks.

He added: ‘Because so many people have at some time or other seen porn on their computer, an attack from this malware can make them think they have something to worry about. But in the vast majority of cases they don’t and the cyber gangs are playing on the vulnerable psychology of the computer user.’

Mark Reckless MP, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘This sounds a particularly nasty computer crime. I’d like to congratulate The Mail on Sunday for bringing this to the attention of your readers. It is that exposure and public education as well as police enforcement which is needed.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Anyone who is a victim of this ransomware will not be in trouble.’
