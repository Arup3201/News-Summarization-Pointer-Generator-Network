Steven Gerrard's Liverpool future is up in the air and the midfielder has a big decision to make regarding his future with the only club he's ever played for.

Having made his Reds debut 16 years ago, Gerrard came on for the final 15 minutes of Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Stoke having been rested by manager Brendan Rodgers, who confirmed after the game that the club have offered their captain a new contract with his current 120,000-a-week deal ending next year. 

Here, Sportsmail's experts give their verdicts on whether the Anfield legend, who turns 35 in May, should stay on Merseyside or go in search of pastures new.

LEE CLAYTON - GO

Go. Go and get some sunshine and few bucks in the MLS. 

Gerrard has been an ambassador, a tremendous footballer and a terrific professional. He is also someone who won’t be fully appreciated by all until he has gone. 

He didn’t win the medals like Scholes and Giggs and he hasn’t scored as many goals as Lampard, but he’s my No. 1 and he should go out while he’s still remembered (by some) in that way.

I get the ‘one club man’ desire, but Arsenal fans don’t think any less of Thierry Henry, do they? 

MATT LAWTON - STAY

He should stay and Liverpool simply can't afford to let him leave. 

Even if his powers are diminishing, his presence remains vitally important. If that means gently moving him into a player-coach role, so be it. He's too important a figure to lose.

ROB DRAPER - GO

He should go, not because he isn't needed and not because he's not good enough, but because he has done enough at Liverpool. 

He doesn't have to prove himself as a one-club man. He'll always be revered at Anfield no matter what happens now. 

It's clear Liverpool won't be winning the league this season and it would be extraordinary if that moment came again in his playing life, so now is a great time to seek new challenges and fresh stimuli. 

It's regenerated Frank Lampard and he only went to Manchester. But preferably, go abroad, learn a language, enjoy a new culture and the last two years of your career with a fresh challenge.

DOMINIC KING - STAY

Stay. This is heading towards being the hardest decision Gerrard has had to make. 

In his mind, the biggest point that needs answering is whether he will still be able to make a contribution next season. If he can answer it positively, then he has to stay. If he wants to try a new challenge and sample life in a different part of the world, not one person could begrudge him.

There are still things for him to achieve and he is the iconic figure at the club. Liverpool would not be the same if he left. 

Whatever he decides, he will be given full support. What Liverpool must ensure, though, is to remind him of exactly how valuable he is to them. 

MIKE ANSTEAD - GO

Steven Gerrard has been a phenomenal player for Liverpool since his debut 16 years ago, but my fear is his legs don’t have enough battery left in them.

If Luis Suarez was still there, they would be title contenders – but now they look a few years off challenging again. Gerrard doesn’t have the luxury of time for another slow, rebuilding project.

SAMI MOKBEL - GO

It sounds unthinkable, but it's time for Gerrard to leave Liverpool. 

I saw him at West Ham earlier in the season and he looked a shadow of the player he was. It might be too far fetched to say his legs have gone, but he can no longer produce those rampaging displays that made him one of Europe's best players in the Premier League. 

He should go to a league where the pace of the game is much slower; Italy perhaps. He'll be able to prolong his playing career by doing that. 

MATT BARLOW - GO

STEVIE GO: For his own sake. His Liverpool career has been magnificent but a couple of years playing in the States, or Down Under will clear his head and give him the space to think and recharge after a career under scrutiny from start to finish. 

He can consider his future and if that is to be in coaching, he can get his qualifications and return to English football ready for that. 

CRAIG HOPE - STAY

Stay, for now. The MLS, however, is where he should ultimately head. 

Steven Gerrard has not become a bad player, he just isn't the brilliant force of old, and probably hasn't been for a few years. Only now is this being highlighted - on and off the pitch - in light of Liverpool's struggle. 

Were he not 'Steven Gerrard', his performance would not merit the scrutiny it is currently receiving.

I saw him play at Newcastle this season, and he was Liverpool's best player. Rather, he was let down by team-mates. But Gerrard should try something new, for him and his family. 

The MLS is an exciting place to be right now and New York Red Bulls need a marquee player. The only question is, could one city accommodate Gerrard and Frank Lampard...

LAURIE WHITWELL - GO

Why not go abroad for his final few years and experience a different scene? 

Some of Italy’s giants are crying out for a midfielder of his stature – the recent Milan derby attested to that – and his playing days would extend further than with Liverpool. 

Would be a fresh challenge in the twilight of his career and he could still return to Anfield a legend in whatever capacity befits. 

JACK GAUGHAN  - GO

It’d be a crying shame if Gerrard’s career merely petered out at Anfield over the next year or two. He owes it to himself to go and play abroad, trying to win a league title somewhere; that could rejuvenate him.

La Liga is a division which is beginning to operate at a faster pace but it’d suit the 34-year-old. It’s not as if he’s never going to enjoy a role at Liverpool when retirement does come. 

RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - STAY

He should stay. Not that his legacy at Liverpool needs enhancing, but there is something endearing about a one-club player. Besides, even if his form were awful, which it isn't, the club still owe him playing time for sticking around at his best.
