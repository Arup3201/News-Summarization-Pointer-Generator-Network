Those were the words Elvis Presley uttered to his fiancée Ginger Alden in the early morning hours of August 16, 1977 at his Memphis mansion, Graceland. And they were the last words he would ever speak.

The King couldn't fall asleep and he didn't want to disturb the beauty queen who was about to become his wife.

‘Okay, but don’t fall asleep,’ she responded, fearing he would zone out while sitting on the john. She  went to bed, leaving his reading light on for him when he returned.

The King and I: Ginger Alden, Elvis Presley's last love, will tell her story in her book, Elvis and Ginger, to be published September 1.  The couple had a great time with friends on their last holiday in Hawaii before he died

When Alden woke up hours later at 2 pm and noticed Elvis' reading light still on, she knocked on the bathroom door, called his name and opened the door. ‘That’s when I saw him in there’.

In her upcoming memoir, Ginger and Elvis, due out September 2 from Berkley Hardcover, the still heartbroken Ginger, now 57, recounts some of the details of her short-lived life with Presley.

She reveals she found him slumped over on the bathroom floor, on his knees with his hands beneath his face, in a grotesque position as though he had been praying.

Ginger bent down to touch him to find his body cold, according to a review of the book by Kirkus Reviews.

‘I slapped him a few times and it was like he breathed once when I turned his head,’ she revealed in the only interview she has given to date. She tried opening an eye to see a cloudy blue pupil.

 ‘It was just blood red, but I couldn't move him.’,

‘I didn't want to think he was dead. God wouldn't want to take him so soon’. She pressed the intercom in the bedroom at Graceland that rang in the kitchen and called for help. 

‘Elvis has fainted,' she screamed.

Beauty queen: With titles Miss Traffic Safety, Miss Mid-South and runner up Miss Tennessee University it's no wonder Ginger caught Presley’s eye

Elvis’s old army buddy and helpmate, Joe Esposito, ran up the stairs, rolled Elvis over and pounded on his chest to try to get him breathing, but rigor mortis had already set in. Elvis had died of poly-pharmacy - the use of multiple medications that are clinically unnecessary -  in his bathroom at Graceland. 

‘His swollen face was buried in the red shag carpet, his tongue, nearly bitten in half, protruding from clinched teeth,' wrote author Alana Nash in her own well-documented biography of Presley, Baby Let's Play House.

 'His beautiful skin now mottled purple-black,’ wrote Nash.

He vomited and crawled a few feet before he died. It was not a painless death, according to Nash.

If Elvis had called out, Ginger likely would not have heard him,'  Nash wrote. Elvis had called nurse Tish Henley, who worked for his personal doctor on site, Dr. George Nichopoulos, known as ‘Dr. Nick’, and asked her to bring up something to help Ginger sleep. 

Nash reports that Henley insisted she sent up one Dilaudid pill, a strong opiate, stronger than Ginger would actually require for the menstrual cramps she said she was suffering.

In her memoir, according to Kirkus, Alden tells the chronological story of how she first met the King when she was five years old and her father was a Public Relations Officer in the army in Memphis. 

She met the music icon at a local fairground when Elvis recognized her father and walked over to say hello. He patted the little girl on her head. Fast forward to November 1976 when Alden’s sister, Terry, the reigning Miss Tennessee, was invited to Graceland to meet Elvis and her sisters, Rosemary and Ginger, went along. 

So in love: 'I know this sounds funny but when Elvis entered the room, I thought trumpets would sound. He looked so handsome,' Ginger revealed in an interview

 

Ginger, a local Memphis beauty queen with the titles Miss Traffic Safety, Miss Mid-South and runner up Miss Tennessee University was the one who caught Presley’s eye.

Ginger gushed, ‘I know this sounds funny but when Elvis entered the room, I thought trumpets would sound. He looked so handsome. He quickly sat in a chair and started talking with each of us. It turned out to be a truly wonderful evening as he took us on a tour of Graceland. 

'Later he sang for us and read aloud from some of his books about religion’.

Alden was two decades younger than Elvis and twenty at the time when she got caught up in life at Graceland and he began showering her with presents of jewels, three cars including a Lincoln Continental, furs and promises his death would prevent him from keeping. 

Nash writes that Alden was a reluctant girlfriend who was put off by his drug use and still involved with a boyfriend in Memphis. But she was encouraged by her mother, Jo LaVern Alden, a serious Elvis fan, to hang in there with the King. 

Jo had taken her little girl to Graceland to peer through the big iron gates, she was such an Elvis fan.

To motivate Ginger to accompany him on tour, Elvis even promised to pay for landscaping at her mother’s house as well as pay off her mortgage. That payout would be an issue the mother would take to court after Elvis’s death. And she would win.

Yes sir: Alden tells the chronological story of how she first met the King when she was five years old and her father was a Public Relations Officer in the army in Memphis. This is her dad with Elvis.

While Ginger writes glowingly about being at his shows, Elvis often motivated her to travel with him by flying in her family as well.

He proposed to Alden in his bathroom at Graceland on January 26 1977. ‘When January 26th came, I felt as I had known Elvis longer than a few months. Our relationship had been so intense as if he wanted me to know almost everything about him in a short time. 

'I knew I had fallen in love and couldn't imagine not being with him. His cousin Billy had told me how Elvis would come in from riding motorcycles, fall across the bed and say, ‘there must be someone out there for me’. We had been together a short time but I felt I had found my soul mate’.

Elvis presented the 11.5 carat diamond engagement ring worth $70,000 made from his TCB (Taking Care of Business) ring he wore on stage saying, ‘I never thought that I would find it in my own backyard, I’m asking you, will you marry me’?

‘I was so happy as he presented a green velvet box, opened it and placed a very large and beautiful diamond ring on my finger. My hand was shaking as we kissed and stepped out of the bathroom into the bedroom. My hand was still trembling as he kept lifting it to look at the ring saying, ‘oh boy’.

Chill: Ginger said Elvis had a relaxing time on their Hawaiian vacation but it was cut short when he got sand in his eye and scratched his cornea. He wanted a doctor in Memphis to check it out

Describing their first sex, in her book she writes, ‘I felt chills as he touched me. Was this it? Were we finally going to make love? I was aroused but anxious, barely able to breathe’.

In her memoir, Ginger reveals Elvis hit her once and apologized. He shot off firearms at a television set and a telephone, threw a dish of ice cream he was devouring when she decided to talk about calories and being fat. He always apologized for his passive aggressive behavior that he exhibited when he didn't get his way. But she tells her story with affection drawing a rosy aura over the scant details she’s willing to finally divulge.

Ginger writes that Elvis was interested in numerology and conspiracy theories but according to the early review, Elvis comes off as a lightweight.

Ginger was a witness in early March 1977 to the signing of Elvis’s Last Will and Testament but there was no mention of her in the document. 

 Immediately after Elvis's will was signed, he went to Hawaii with an entourage of thirty including the Alden's sisters -- Rosemary and Terry. They all checked into the Rainbow Towers, Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel but Elvis would move out with Ginger and into a rented beach house in Kailua, on the other side of the Island.

He relaxed on the beach, played touch football, went shopping, watched television, played ping pong and ate cheeseburgers, pizza, barbecue dinners -- before promising he'd go on a diet when he got back to Memphis. 

'My time with Elvis was so special and the Hawaiian vacation was a lot of fun', Ginger said.

It was to be his last vacation, but it was cut short when he got sand in his eye and scratched his cornea. He wanted a doctor in Memphis to check it out. 

'I stayed at Graceland and administered eye cream for a few days so I could help him be prepared for his next tour.'

Fans branded Ginger as the woman who had not saved Elvis. Ginger stepped out of the public eye after the King’s death. She did the one interview in  2002 and declared this was the last time she was talking – until the idea for her memoir evolved twelve years later.
