Arsenal are still very much in the race at the top of the Premier League table and can pip both Chelsea and Manchester City to the title, claims midfielder Mesut Ozil.

Jose Mourinho's Blues side sit top of the standings with Manuel Pellegrini's City just behind - a full 13 and 11 points ahead of the Gunners respectively.

Yet German playmaker Ozil is convinced Arsenal can overhaul the deficit and lift the coveted trophy in May.

The Gunners' record £42.5million signing said: 'We have a really strong team. People could see that once again against Stoke.

'So I don't see why we shouldn't finish right at the very top of the table. When you play football you should always have belief in yourself.'

The 26-year-old has recently recovered from serious knee-ligament damage and returned to the first-team fold last weekend when he came on as a substitute in the 3-0 victory over Stoke City, replacing Olivier Giroud after 73 minutes.

And the former Real Madrid star is delighted to have made his comeback.

He added: 'I was as happy as a little kid to be able to kick a ball again.'
