University of Florida freshman quarterback Treon Harris has been suspended from the team while authorities investigate claims he sexually assaulted a female student.

The 19-year-old true freshman stands accused of assaulting an unidentified peer in a campus dorm at 12:49am Sunday morning - just hours after leading the Gators to victory at the University of Tennessee.

According to the Gainesville university campus' crime log, the only incident of sexual battery this week happened at the Springs Residential complex and was reported on Monday.

A source told Florida Today that the investigation may take several weeks, so its unlikely the athlete will be back on the field in this weekend's game against Louisiana State University.

No charges have been filed, and as of Monday Harris had not been arrested. He has since taken his Twitter profile down.

'We are representing him and we are cooperating with the investigation,' his attorney Huntley Johnson said. 'I am hopeful that he will never be arrested [regarding this case].'

Florida head coach Will Muschamp postponed his regular Monday press conference in light of the charges, and the university confirmed the report in a written statement

'We have no tolerance for sexual assault on our campus,' UF President Bernie Machen said in a statement released by the school.

'The university is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for every member of the UF community. We must strive to protect all of our students from sexual harassment and assault, and do everything in our power to promote a safe learning environment,' he added.

The Gainesville police have been called in to assist campus police with the investigation, in collecting and analyzing forensic evidence.

The 5-foot-11, 190-pound Harris replaced starting quarterback Jeff Drisken in the lineup for the game against Tennessee, and helped lead the team to a 10-9 victory.

His suspension puts the team at a disadvantage going into next weekend's game against LSU, since reserve quarterback Will Grier has been sidelined for three weeks due to back spasms.

Harris made his debut with the Gators in the September 6 blowout against Eastern Michigan University.

He graduated from Booker T Washington High School in Miami, where he helped lead the squad to a Class 4A championship in 2012 and 2013.

Monday's allegations come a year afters similar accusations were brought up against the quarterback of rival Florida State University, Jameis Winston.  

Heisman Trophy-winner Winston was able to continue playing because formal charges were never filed.
