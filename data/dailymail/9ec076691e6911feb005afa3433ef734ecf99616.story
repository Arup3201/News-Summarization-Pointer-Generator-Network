A nine-year-old girl came across a rather unusual surprise in her Goldfish crackers when she opened a packet to discover a silver wedding ring, complete with diamonds.

Knowing something wasn't quite right with what she had found in the snack pack, Peyton Postol turned to ask her mother Stephanie whether the ring was supposed to be in there.

Peyton, of South Carolina, had been given the packet of crackers while she and her mother got ready to go to an appointment.

Peyton told WSPA: 'I opened it up and I asked my mom, is there supposed to be a ring in here?'

The crackers' manufacturers Pepperidge Farm has now asked the family to return the packet along with the diamond ring.

'We're very surprised that it was found in the pack', Pepperidge Farm spokesman Anna Burr told Good 4 Utah.

She said the company 'have in place a number of processes to avoid something like this from happening.'

Burr said employees are forbidden from wearing jewellery and must also wear gloves, while all the packets pass through a metal detector before being sent out.

Last month it was reported a woman was pleasantly shocked when the family pet vomited up her wedding ring six years after it first went missing.

Lois Matykowski was devastated when her wedding band first disappeared and even checked her dog’s waste for several weeks in the vain hope of recovering her prized possession.

Bizarrely the ring finally reappeared in June and the culprit after all this time was Tucker, the family’s 10-year-old Rottweiler mix adopted from the Wisconsin Humane Society.
