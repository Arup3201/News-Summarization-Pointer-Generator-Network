On the day of her arranged marriage to 85-year-old Rulon Jeffs, a man 66 years her senior, Rebecca Musser remembers feeling resigned to a horrific fate. 

'I had just resigned myself to the fact that this was my fate and just to surrender to it,' Musser, who was 19 at the time, recalls in an interview with NBC's 'Dateline.' 'I remember walking in [to the ceremony] and thinking, "Just stand up and do your duty."' 

Jeffs, the leader of extremist polygamous Mormon sect called the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, had chosen her as his 19th bride.

Musser was called into Rulon Jeffs' bedroom to engage in sexual acts at least three times a month, she said

He was considered a prophet by the FLDS. Why didn't she feel grateful that she had been chosen by him? she wondered.

'Holding this old man's hand... I felt lost,' she said, recalling how he was so weak he could barely stand. 'I was ashamed that I was not more thrilled.'

But nothing compared to the horror of what followed: Seven years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffs.

'He was old, and even though he couldn't [have sex], he did still try,' she told 'Dateline.' 'It was horrifying.'

Once,
 when she resisted his advances, Jeffs' son, Warren - who later because 
the leader of the FLDS - threatened that she would be 'destroyed in the 
flesh' if she ever turned him down again.

'For the women [in FLDS], they are owned - body, mind and soul' by their husbands, she said. 

Musser's
 younger sister, Elissa Wall, was forced to marry her first cousin when 
she was just 14. Wall said her husband abused her both physically and 
emotionally. She remembers taking her vows with 'tears streaming down my
 face.'

'I had never been taught about anatomy or sex,' she said. 'I was absolutely being raped.'

Musser,
 Wall and others were terrified to try and leave the compound, despite 
their misery. They were taught that outsiders were evil and that if they
 left, they would become 'a diseased whore in the streets.'

But when Rulon Jeffs died in 2002 at the age of 92, Musser, then 26, finally decided she had had enough.

In the cover of darkness, she scaled the wall surrounding Jeffs' home, slipped 
past the armed guards and fled, knowing that leaders of the sect would 
drag her back to the compound if she was caught.

She arranged for her brother, who had escaped some years earlier, to pick her up and help her start a new life.

On the outside, she began helping 
authorities prosecute members of the church. She testified 20 times and 
helped federal prosecutors win 11 convictions against members of the 
FLDS.

In her new life, Musser said she found herself. Helping the federal government prosecute members of the church allowed her to cope with the pain of adjusting to life outside the compound.

She showed up to to testify against Warren Jeffs and other FLDS members in a striking red dress. It was a show of defiance to a religious leader who banned followers from wearing the color.

On the compound, women were owned by their husbands - 'body, mind, and soul,' Musser said

Warren Jeffs was convicted in August 2011 of raping a two girls, age 15 and 12, who were his 'spiritual wives.'

The first time Miss Musser testified against him was in 2007, when he was convicted of accessory to rape after he married off Alyssa Wall.

Warren Jeffs, who reportedly had as many as 80 wives, is serving life plus 10 years in a Texas prison.
