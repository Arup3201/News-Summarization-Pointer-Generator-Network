Newcastle misfit Hatem Ben Arfa is wanted by Serie A giants AC Milan.

And the Frenchman has been told he can leave and Newcastle want around £12million.

The 27-year-old was left out of the first team squad that toured New Zealand and has been training with the reserves.

Wanted: Hatem Ben Arfa is a target for AC Milan

Out of favour: The Frenchman has fallen down the pecking order at St James's Park

He has been restricted to a behind closed doors game with Queen of the South.

Ben Arfa joined Newcastle in 2010 and is an established fans' favourite, but he fell out of favour at St James' Park last season.

Meanwhile, Newcastle have expressed an interest in Sochaux midfielder Sanjin Prcic, 20, but look like missing out to FC Twente who have offered £2m.
