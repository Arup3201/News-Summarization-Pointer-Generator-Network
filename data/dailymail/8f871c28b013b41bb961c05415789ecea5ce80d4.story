A Japanese 80-year-old has become the oldest man  to reach the summit of Mount Everest.

Extreme skier Yuichiro Miura conquered the 29,035ft peak at 9am local time Thursday morning, beating his 81-year-old rival, Nepalese Min Bahadur Sherchan, to the top.

Mr Miura climbed Mount Everest five years ago, but just missed out on the record when Mr Serchan, a former Gurkha, accomplished the feat aged 76.

Mr Miura and his son Gota called the support team from the summit to report the news.

‘This is the world's best feeling,’ Mr Miura said. ‘I'm also totally exhausted.’

His rival, Mr Sherchan, is at the base camp on Mount Everest preparing for his own attempt on the summit 
next week.

On his expedition's website, Miura 
explained his attempt to scale Everest at such an advanced age: 'It is 
to challenge (my) own ultimate limit. It is to honor the great Mother 
Nature.'

He said a successful climb would 
raise the bar for what is possible, adding: 'If the limit of age 80 is 
at the summit of Mt Everest, the highest place on earth, one can never 
be happier.'

Miura reached the South Col, the 
jumping-off point for most final ascents, on Tuesday, according to his 
website, which also posted pictures of him eating hand-rolled sushi 
inside a tent.

Gyanendra Shrestha, a Nepalese mountaineering official at
the base camp, confirmed that he had reached the summit on Thursday morning.

Public broadcaster NHK showed footage of Mr Miura's daughter Emili talking with them via speaker phone in Tokyo, clapping when her brother told her they had reached the top.

Mr Miura's new record will only last a few days if Sherchan is able to follow him.

Miura's daughter, Emili Miura, said 
he 'doesn't really care' about the rivalry. 'He's doing it for his own 
challenge,' she said.

The situation was not too different 
five years ago, when, at the age of 75, Miura sought to recapture the 
title of oldest man to summit the mountain. He had set the record in 
2003 at age 70, but it was later broken twice by slightly older Japanese
climbers.

On his way: Miura says the feat, while difficult for a man of any age, will add 70 years to his physical body age - making him feel more like 150 years old

He reached the summit on May 26, 
2008, at the age of 75 years and 227 days, according to Guinness World 
Records, however the record eluded him because Sherchan had scaled the 
summit the day before, at the age of 76 years and 340 days.

His daughter Emili Miura said her father decided to go
ahead with the expedition, despite having had four heart surgeries, because he felt that at 
age 80, he was running out of time.

Mr Miura fractured his pelvis and left 
thigh bone in a 2009 skiing accident, and had an operation in January 
for an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, his fourth heart surgery 
since 2007, Ms Miura said.

Still competitive: Mr Sherchan will start climbing Everest next week to retake his record

On his ascent, Miura made a stop at 
the rarely used Camp 5 to take a break between the South Col and the 
summit. Almost all the climbers these days walk straight from Camp 4 to 
the summit.

Mr Miura was well-known long before his late-in-life mountaineering pursuits, as an extreme skier.

He 
skied down Everest's South Col in 1970, using a parachute to brake his 
descent. The feat was captured in the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, 'The Man Who Skied Down Everest.'

In 1964, he briefly set a world speed
skiing record in the Italian Alps, reaching 107 mph. He also skied down Mt. Fuji using parachutes.

It wasn't until Miura was 70, 
however, that he first climbed all the way to the summit of Everest. 
When he summited again at 75, he claimed to be the only man to 
accomplish the feat twice in his 70s. After that, he said he was 
determined to climb again at age 80.

Mr Miura was accompanied on the 
expedition by his son Gota, 43, a two-time Olympian skier, who also  
summited Everest in 2003 with his father.

Mr Miura's rival, Mr Sherchan first began mountaineering in 1960 when he climbed 
Mount Dhaulagiri, the 8,167-meter (26,790-foot) high peak in Nepal, 
according to his grandson, Manoj Guachan.

Always an adventurer, and unbowed by age, he walked the length of Nepal in 2003.

Sherchan and his team said Wednesday 
that they were prepared for their new climb, despite digestive problems 
he suffered several days ago.

'Our team leader has just arrived 
back at base camp and we are holding a team meeting on when exactly I 
will head up to the summit,' Sherchan, who uses a hearing aid, said by 
telephone from the base camp.

'I am fine and in good health. I am ready to take up the challenge. Our plan is to reach the summit within one week.'

It takes three to four days for climbers to reach Camp 4 on South Col from base camp, and another day to reach the summit.

There are only a few windows of good 
weather during the climbing season in May for people to attempt the 
summit.

Sherchan's team is also facing 
financial difficulties. It hasn't received the financial help that the 
Nepal government announced it would provide them.

Purna Chandra 
Bhattarai, chief of Nepal's mountaineering department, said the aid 
proposal was still under consideration.
