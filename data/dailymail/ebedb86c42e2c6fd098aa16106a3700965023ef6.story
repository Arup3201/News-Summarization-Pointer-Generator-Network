Animal expert and 'outback wrangler' Matt Wright who spends most of his time, relocating wildlife, and collecting crocodile eggs in the wet season definitely had a bit of a close call with one fiesty character.

The 33 year old, a well-known Nat Geo Wild channel personality, was fishing at the mouth of the Victoria river near the Western Australian border when it's believed a large crocodile tried to steal his dinner.

The NT News reported that the hungry croc followed his catch back to the bank in an attempt to try and chow down.

'With the movement of the fish flapping around he got pretty inquisitive and came up to grab it,' he said.

'He was only about 1.2 metres long — the photo makes it look worse than it is.'

'I’ve never had a problem with the big ones, unless they’re trying to defend a nest. But the little ones are really inquisitive. he told NT News.

The daring facebook picture from 2012, which sees Matt prodding the crocodile with a fishing stick only just surfaced this week.

The animal lover then told the bizarre story to go with it, of how he had to fend off the hungry croc so he could keep his catch which was his dinner.

Mr Wright said when the animal fronted him on the river, he was fortunately able to defend his catch by chucking the reptile one of the smaller fish.

It's believed he then tried to steer the reptile back into the water, prodding him with a fishing rod.

'I moved him back into the water with my rod — better that getting chewed than my foot,' he said.

Mr Wright who runs tourism venture 'Wild Aussie Escapes' is also a chopper pilot and runs his own helicopter service.

With one of the deadliest jobs on the planet collecting crocodile eggs, he has to rely on adrenalin and his skills to get him out of many dangerous situations....just like this situation! But there's no doubt he'll have plenty more adventures to come.

'Ouback wrangler' Matt Wright regularly likes to go fishing. His big catches have something got the attention of hungry crocodiles. One tried to steal his catch or his dinner but had to be lured away with some other 'smaller' tasty treats and prodded with a fishing rod to get back into the water
