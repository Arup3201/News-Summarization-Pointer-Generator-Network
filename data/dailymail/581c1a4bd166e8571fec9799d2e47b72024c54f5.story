If you want the memory of your loved ones or family pets to live on you can now immortalise them as a tree. 

A Barcelona firm has designed a biodegradable urn that is planted in the ground and can be used to grow ash, oak, beech or gingko trees.

The environmentally-friendly vessel contains the seed of a tree in the top half that germinates before the roots grow through the section containing the ashes in the lower half.

The Bios Urn (pictured) has been developed by  estudimoline. It said it wanted to create something that changed the way people saw death, instead of it being 'the end of life' it would become a 'return to life'

The Bios Urn have been developed by Barcelona-based Gerard Moline and his brother Roger at design studio estudimoline. 

They said they wanted to create something that changed the way people saw death, instead of it being 'the end of life' it would become a 'return to life'. 

Relatives or pet owners begin by choosing what kind of tree they  want, and seeds currently available include pine, gingko, maple, oak, ash and beech.  

The ashes are placed inside the urn and the seed is mixed with soil in the top capsule.

The urn is then buried in the ground and starts to biodegrade when the roots are strong enough to come into contact with the ashes.

Mr Moline said it needs the same care as a standard tree, so needs to be planted somewhere with proper soil humidity and at least three hours of sunlight a day.

Bios Urn can be used with any ashes and will keep 'indefinitely' meaning people can buy them ahead of their death, for example. 

Equally, it can be used with ash saved from another urn if a person has already been cremated.  

A Bios Urn costs $145 (£98) plus shipping costs and the box comes with everything needed to plant it.

The company said: 'Bios Urn offers a smart, sustainable and ecologically friendly way to approach what's probably one of the most important moments in human life.

A similar project being developed in Seattle plans to turn corpses into compost and used as plant food. Called the Urban Death Project, it proposes corpses are placed into a giant tower (illustrated) by families and left to decompose. The body would be laid in a mixture of woodchips and sawdust 

A similar project being developed in Seattle plans to turn corpses into compost and used as plant food.  

Called the Urban Death Project, it proposes corpses are placed into a giant tower by families and left to decompose.

After six weeks, their body will have broken down into compost.  

The body would be laid in a mixture of woodchips and sawdust in a three-storey tower.

It would then decompose and turns into a nutrient-rich compost, which is removed from the bottom of the tower.

'The intent is to offer users an alternative for remembering deceased people or pets in a natural, sustainable fashion. It is innovative, useful and discreet.'

The firm behind the project hopes it will create a new and more eco-friendly way to dispose of the dead. 

Designer Katrina Spade said she got the idea from animal composting. 

She plans to launch a  Kickstarter campaign later this month to build a prototypes system by 2020, and admits it also faces legal problems.
