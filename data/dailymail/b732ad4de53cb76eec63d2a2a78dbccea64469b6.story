Bizarre: A firm is selling bizarre female 'zombie' mannequins that bleed when they are shot

A gun target firm is hoping angry husbands and boyfriends will take out their frustrations on its bizarre new product - female 'zombie' mannequins which bleed when they are shot.

The targets, called 'The Ex,' have been advertised wearing nothing but a bra and a ripped top.

ZMB industries has tagged pictures of the product with the warning: 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned but a man scorned is nothing to mess with!'

The mannequins come with a promise that they will 'accurately resemble an infected human that just finished gnawing your neighbor Zedâ€™s leg, to give you that realistic look so you really feel the hate,' according to Raw Story.

They are filled with biodegradable 
matter - and 'burst into little pieces of 
blood soaked, zombie matter when you shoot them,' ZMB said on its website.

The 'zombies' are designed to take a lot of punishment, with the firm claiming they can be shot more than 1,000 times using a range of different rounds.

ZMB's website features videos of different kinds of mannequins being shot to pieces on a shooting range.

One video suggests how to 'turn a zombie into mush in 60 seconds,' while another shows a young girl called 'Samantha,' shooting at one of the targets.

In another video a man wraps explosive around two zombie mannequins in the desert and blows them up.

As well as the female mannequins, the
firm also offers a range of other targets, including a version that 
looks like a Taliban fighter, and another dressed as a Nazi.

Other targets on sale include a wolf, a clown and even a group of rabbits.

Those not satisfied with simply shooting the mannequins then have the option of using ZMB's 'exploding rifle targets' to blow them up.
