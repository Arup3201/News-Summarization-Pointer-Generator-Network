A sacred tunnel discovered
in the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacan is filled with 50,000 ritual objects and may lead to royal tombs.

The entrance to the 1,800-year-old tunnel was first
discovered in 2003, and its contents came to light thanks to
excavations by remote-control robots and then human researchers,
archeologist Sergio Gomez told reporters.

The site is located about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of
Mexico City.

The ruins have long been shrouded in mystery
because its inhabitants did not leave behind written records.

The artifacts found inside the tunnel, located below the
Temple of the Plumed Serpent, include finely carved stone
sculptures, jewelry and shells.

An estimated 50,000 objects, 4,000 made of wood as well as
scores of obsidian blades and arrow heads, provide clues into
how the city's priests and rulers conceived the underworld.

'Due to the magnitude of the offerings that we've found, it
can't be in any other place,' said Gomez, who works for Mexico's
national anthropology and history institute, referring to the
possibility of finding royal tombs.

'We've been able to confirm all of the hypotheses we've made
from the beginning,' he added, saying ongoing excavations could
yield more major discoveries next year.

One of Mexico's most-visited ancient sites, Teotihuacan is
home to massive pyramids, temples and elite residences including
many adorned with colorful murals.

The city reached its peak between 100 B.C. and 650 B.C. with
a population as large as 200,000, growing rich from a
wide-ranging trade in obsidian that in pre-Colombian times was
used to make knives and other weapons.

The city had long been abandoned by the time the Aztecs came
to power in the Valley of Mexico in the 14th century, yet it
continued to play an important role as a destination for
religious pilgrimages.

In Nahuatl, the Aztec language still spoken in many parts of
Mexico, Teotihuacan means 'abode of the gods.'

The temple is best known for the towering Pyramids of the Moon and the Sun.

The complex of pyramids, plazas, temples and avenues was once the center of a city of more than 100,000 inhabitants and may have been the largest and most influential city in pre-Hispanic North America at the time.

But nearly 2,500 years after the city was founded - and about 2,100 years after the Teotihuacan culture began to flourish there - very little is known about the identity of its rulers.

Sculptures unearthed at the Teotihuacan archeological site in Mexico. Mexican archaeologists have concluded a years long exploration of a tunnel sealed nearly 2,000 years ago.

No depiction of a ruler, or the tomb of a monarch, has ever been found, setting the metropolis apart from other pre-Hispanic cultures that deified their rulers.

Vertical excavations begun in 2009 to reach the mouth of the tunnel suggest it was a ruler's tomb, archaeologist Sergio Gomez said in 2010.

Rich offerings were tossed into the tunnel at the moment it was closed up, including almost 50,000 objects of jade, stone, shell and pottery, including ceramic beakers of a kind never found before at the site.

The city was abandoned by the time the Aztecs arrived in the area in the 1300s and gave it the name 'Teotihuacan,' which means 'the place where men become gods.'

'I think the tunnel was the central element, the main element around which the rest of the ceremonial center was built,' Gomez said.

'This was the most sacred place.'

'There is a high possibility that in this place, in the central chamber, we can find the remains of those who ruled Teotihuacan,' he added.
