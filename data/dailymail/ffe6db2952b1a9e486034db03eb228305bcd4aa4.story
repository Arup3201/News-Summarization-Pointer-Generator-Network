Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has insisted he will serve his full term at Old Trafford — even if the club fail to qualify for the Champions League.

Bookmakers drop their odds on Van Gaal leaving Old Trafford every time United concede, and that has happened 13 times in seven games so far.

But the 63-year-old promised he will be in his post until 2017 despite their poor start, which sees them play Everton on Sunday outside the top six and eight points behind leaders Chelsea.

Louis van Gaal insists he will see out his three-year contrat at Old Trafford

‘I have signed a three-year contract. Believe me, I shall finish that,’ said Van Gaal.

‘The target is Champions League, but not at once. There is a trajectory and a process of three years.’

They face Everton without Wayne Rooney, who was sent off against West Ham last weekend. Darren Fletcher is expected to step in as captain and Paddy McNair could continue in defence, with Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans all out.
