Video footage capturing the final moments of a British suicide bomber's life has been released by a terrorist group in Syria. 

The clip, recorded by the al-Qaeda-aligned group Jabhat al-Nusra, shows Abdul Waheed Majeed relaxing and smiling moments before he carried out the suicide attack, the first by a Briton.

In the 'martydom' video, the 41-year-old is seen wearing white Muslim robe while posing for photos with fellow soldiers and pointing up to the sky.

Message: Majeed was speaking into the camera minutes before he drove a truck full of explosives into a Syrian prison

Just minutes after the footage was captured, he drove a truck full of explosives into a prison killing himself, along with many others. 

Pictures yesterday emerged of him relaxing with local children. The images were sent by the suspected bomber from Syria to his family in the Langley Green area of Crawley, West Sussex.

In one picture, he is seen wearing pink Minnie Mouse-style ears while he cuddles a child. In another, he is pictured kneeling surrounded by children as they give the peace sign.

The pictures were taken at a refugee camp on the Turkey/Syria border, according to Arif Syed, 59, a community leader in Crawley, where Majeed was born.

Posing: He was also pictured with three young boys in a refugee camp on the Syria-Turkey border

Married father of three Majeed is suspected of driving a lorry into a jail in Aleppo and detonating a bomb last week.

Officials have not confirmed the identity of the bomber amid reports that a UK jihadi, who used the name Abu Suleiman al-Britani, carried out the bombing.

Counter-terrorism officers have searched Majeedâ€™s home in Crawley which is also the ex-home of schoolgirl Sarah Payneâ€™s killer Roy Whiting, according to neighbours.

Majeed, known as Waheed, left Britain six months ago, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.

Mr Syed said Majeed would phone or Skype his family every three days, but communication was lost with him about nine days ago.

When news emerged about the suicide bombing in Syria, the family of Majeed - who is of Pakistani descent - started to panic, he added.

Majeedâ€™s uncle, Mohammad Jamil, 65, said Majeed - who is a father of two boys and a girl aged 18, 16 and 12 - had never shown any sign of extremism.

But this week extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed told the London Evening Standard that Majeed was 'a very dear brother'.

He claimed Majeed had been an active and valued member of the banned extremist Al-Muhajiroun organisation between 1996 and 2004 and had wanted to further the 'Muslim cause'.

Bakri said Majeed would organise his sermons in Crawley and record the lectures and distribute them.

He said: 'He was a good brother. He was someone who was always at hand to help people.

'He wanted to study Islam and wanted to know what it was to be a good Muslim. He was also very interested in the issue of how we could establish an Islamic state.'

The South East Counter Terrorism Unit said there have been no arrests following the searches of properties in Crawley this week.
