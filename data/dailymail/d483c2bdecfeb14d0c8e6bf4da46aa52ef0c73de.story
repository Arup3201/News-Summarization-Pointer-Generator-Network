The economy will grow by more than expected this year but the crisis in the euro is ‘a major risk’ to Britain, the Chancellor said today.

George Osborne said growth forecasts for 2012 have been nudged up from a paltry 0.7 per cent to a still feeble 0.8 per cent.

Delivering his third Budget, he said Britain would ‘avoid a technical recession’ with a return to growth in the first quarter of the year.

Mr Osborne said the economy has ‘carried a little more momentum into the New Year than previously anticipated’.

He predicted growth of 2 per cent next year, 2.7 per cent in 2014 and 3 per cent in both 2015 and 2016.

In a sign that the battered public 
finances are improving, the Chancellor said the government would borrow 
£126 billion this year – slightly less than the £127 billion predicted 
in November.

The deficit will then fall to £120 billion next year, then £98 billion, £75 billion, £52 billion and £21 billion in 2016-17.

‘So in total, borrowing is £11 
billion less than I last forecast in the Autumn,’ said Mr Osborne. ‘This
will be used to pay down debt.’

But with the single currency still in
crisis, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury watchdog Mr 
Osborne set up to stop Chancellors fiddling the figures, said it now 
expects the eurozone to shrink by 0.3 per cent this year. It previously 
expected 0.5 per cent growth.

‘Of course, Britain is not immune 
from these developments in our largest export markets,’ said Mr Osborne.
‘And the OBR say today that "the situation in the euro area remains a 
major risk to our forecast".

‘Another risk they identify is a 
"further spike in oil prices", and there is no doubt that the high oil 
price - driven both by real demand and the Iranian situation - is of 
great concern across the world.’

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at 
IHS Global Insight, said: ‘The new forecasts from the OBR provide a rare
recent luxury for a UK Chancellor with the growth forecasts being 
essentially unchanged from those contained in last November’s Autumn 
Statement and the projected public finance shortfalls trimmed for the 
next five years.

‘This is of welcome relief to the 
Chancellor and spares him having to tighten overall fiscal policy 
further. Indeed, the Chancellor has indicated that the budget is 
fiscally neutral over the next five years. 

‘Having said that projected GDP 
growth of 0.8 per cent in 2012 is still worryingly weak and hardly a 
matter for celebration. And the very disappointing public finance data 
for February itself highlights that there are serious risk to the 
government meeting its fiscal targets.’

The February figures – published just three hours before the Budget – showed that the government borrowed £15.2bn in February.

That was nearly double the £8bn expected and the £8.9bn shortfall clocked up in the same month last year.

It meant that the deficit for the 
first 11 months of the fiscal year was £110bn, according to the Office 
for National Statistics, compared with £118.9bn last time around.

The unexpected surge in borrowing made grim reading for Mr Osborne as he put the finishing touches to his third Budget speech.

The towering national debt also jumped to £995bn – around £40,000 per household.

Philip Shaw, chief UK economist at 
Investec, said the figures were ‘completely out of the blue’ after 
improvements in recent months.

‘It seems to be a combination of a 
fall in tax receipts and a big increase in government spending,’ he 
said. ‘It provides a pretty uncomfortable background for the Budget.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Today’s 
data shows that the Government is making progress in cutting the deficit
this year. Borrowing in February was high for the month, bringing the 
overall total closer to the OBR’s Autumn Statement forecast for 2011-12 
of £127bn. '

As expected, growth in departmental 
spending has increased towards the end of the fiscal year, bringing it 
closer to forecast, and income tax receipts were weak.’
