Two thugs forced a former trainee butcher to help them cut off his own toe in a torture ordeal described by a judge as 'like a Quentin Tarantino movie'.

Richard Headford was bundled into a Mercedes by Blake Waldron and Curtis Jewell after they accused him of stealing drugs from them.

He was driven to a property in Campian Walk, Inns Court, Bristol, where he was forced to sit in a chair and choose between losing a finger or toe.

Using his knowledge as a butcher, terrified Mr Headford instructed Waldron on the cleanest way to sever his little toe to prevent a worse injury.

Wannabe gangster Waldron, 24, pocketed the digit and told his bleeding victim he could only have it back in return for £3,000.

Judge Martin Picton jailed Waldron for 11 years and three months and Jewell, 22, was sentenced to eight years and eight months at Bristol Crown Court.

Jailing them, he said: 'The scene that played out, as graphically portrayed on the prosecution papers, is reminiscent of the sort of thing that might be expected to feature in a Quentin Tarantino movie or the like.

'For your victim this was an utterly terrifying event, in the course of which he, for good reason, believed he was to die.'

The court heard Waldron asked Mr Headford to look after a parcel of drugs for a day in return for £200 in June last year.

But when Waldron picked it up, he claimed 'seven ounces' were missing and that Mr Headford had opened the package and removed drugs.

Although no drugs were ever recovered, police said they suspected it to be a Class A narcotic.

The following month Waldron picked up 'terrified' Mr Headford in his black Mercedes and with Jewell in the back, drove him to a house and produced what appeared to be a black handgun.

Waldron demanded £3,000 upfront and then £7,000 in a month, and told Mr Headford to call his father for the cash, but he couldn't help.

Distraught Mr Headford was told to sit in an armchair while Jewell appeared with a large bread knife, and a hammer, knife and some ties were taken from a bag and laid in front of him.

While he protested his innocence, Jewell put his knife to his face and told him to shut up, and Waldron told Mr Headford to choose between losing a toe or a finger.

Mr Mooney said: 'Mr Headford was relieved. He felt that the loss of a limb was preferable to death.

'He told Waldron he was prepared to lose the little toe in his left foot.'

After Jewell laid a sheet of plastic on the floor, Waldron told Headford to remove his shoe and sock and picked up a knife with a curved blade but repeatedly swung it and missed.

Mr Mooney added: 'Mr Headford told him if he carried on like that he would take half his foot off. He assisted in his own mutilation to prevent a worse thing happening.

'He asked for tissues, placed them between his little toe and next toe, and instructed Waldron in the most effective way to remove his toe.

'He asked him to get closer and chop it off, rather than hack it off.'

Mr Mooney said that it took several attempts to remove the toe, adding: 'Socks and cable were shoved into the mouth of Mr Headford to prevent him from crying out in the agony he must have been feeling.'

The court heard Waldron wrapped the toe in tissue, put it in his pocket, and said he would return it for £3,000 telling his victim: 'I'm on a downer now. I don't really like hurting people.'

Mr Headford went to hospital and while his foot healed, he said the experience was a 'nightmare'.

In a statement, the trainee butcher from Knowle West, Bristol, said: 'I left the area immediately. I left all my family and friends behind and left Bristol.

'It has put a huge strain on my relationship and I've moved several times.'

Mr Mooney said the ordeal of 'calculated barbarism' was designed to 'establish himself as a feared criminal'.

He added: 'The violence and torture meted out to Richard Headford had a greater purpose. They were designed to let those involved in crime know Mr Waldron had arrived and were he to be crossed this would be the result on those who crossed him.'

Both the men from Knowle West, Bristol, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Timothy Rose, defending Jewell, said his client picked up the knife but did not use it, but admitted he had previously been convicted of GBH, when he bit a man's ear during a fight.

Farah Rashid, defending Waldron, said: 'Mr Waldron takes full responsibility for the offence and his actions. Extreme low intelligence may well have contributed to this.'
