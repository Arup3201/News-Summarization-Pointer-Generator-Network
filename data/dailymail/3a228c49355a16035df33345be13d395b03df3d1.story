Crowdsourced: Over $234,000 dollars were raised on the first GoFundMe page for Officer Darren Wilson

Mysterious: Officer Darren Wilson, pictured earlier this year, has not been see following the shooting of teenager Michael Brown 

'Unfortunately, to do so requires us to end collection on the current page that you are viewing now,' the post said. 'GoFundMe does not allow transfer of existing campaigns, even to charities. Please know that all funds received from our events, this GoFundMe site and our TeeSpring campaign will be donated to Officer Darren Wilson, and in the future, donations will still be donated to Officer Wilson, but will be tax deductible for donors as well.'

Early Tuesday morning, GoFundMe announced on Twitter 'In regard to the "Officer Darren Wilson" campaign, donors' comments posted in violation of GoFundMe's terms have been removed.' 

Multiple comments left by people who donated money had been criticized on social media as racist. 

Several of those comments were compiled and published by Jon Hedren on Twitter. 

'Waste of good ammo. It's my privilege to buy you a replacement box,' one of those tweets read. 

Another Tweet compiled by Hedren said 'I support officer Wilson he did great job removing an unnecessary thing from the public!'

Some Twitter users have criticized the page's existence, saying it violates GoFundMe's terms of service, which bans 'items that promote hate, violence, racial intolerance, or the financial exploitation of a crime.'

Expenses: A page set up on behalf of Michael Brown's parents has raised slightly over $201,000

The new page, 'Support Officer Wilson,' says that 1,688 people collectively donated $71,307 in two days.

Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page on behalf of Michael Brown's family, 'Michael Brown Memorial Fund,' has raised $201,789. That page says there have been 7,074 contributors in nine days.

That money 'will be used by the Brown family to cover funeral and burial expenses, travel and living expenses of the parents as they seek justice for their son, Michael Brown, Jr.,' according to the page, which is reportedly managed by lawyers for Brown's parents.

GoFundMe said in a statement sent to MailOnline late Friday afternoon "GoFundMe is a neutral platform, home to nationally referenced fundraising campaigns that include both the 'Michael Brown Memorial Fund' and the 'Support Officer Darren Wilson' campaign."

In its statement, GoFundMe also said 'The content of the campaign itself is not in violation of GoFundMe's terms of service. However, some donors' comments have contained content that is in violation of GoFundMe's terms and have been removed accordingly.'
