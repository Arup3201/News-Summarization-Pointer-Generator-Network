Case: Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell, who has been charged with 19 child sex offences, looked tearful as he left Manchester Magistrates Court

Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell looked tired and haggard when he appeared in court yesterday charged with sexual offences against a child.

The 48-year-old, who plays garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 series, stood in the dock before a packed courtroom.

Appearing under his real name, Michael Turner, the soap star arrived for an eight-minute hearing at Manchester City Magistrates’ Court, just a few hundred yards from the Granada Studios where he has filmed for the past 30 years.

Le Vell is charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

The alleged sex offences all relate to one child and took place between 2001 and 2010, the court was told. Le Vell arrived flanked by minders and stood in the glass-panelled dock.

The father-of-two, who wore a light grey suit, white shirt and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.

District Judge Khalid Qureshi asked Richard Gowthorpe, defending, if there was any indication of plea, to which Mr Gowthorpe replied: ‘No indication of plea other than the fact that the charges are contested, and will be fully contested in the crown court.’

Le Vell was bailed on condition that he surrenders his passport, does not contact witnesses and does not have unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 14.

He left court looking tearful and distressed as members of the public looked on. The actor was first arrested at his £750,000 home in Hale, Cheshire, in September 2011 after a teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her.

But three months later, after a police
investigation, prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take
the allegations to court.

At
the time Le Vell said he was ‘delighted’ to have been ‘completely 
exonerated’ and was said to be relieved he was able to continue his 
Coronation Street career.

He
thanked police for their ‘thorough investigation’ and expressed his 
gratitude to fans and the Coronation Street cast for their loyal support
during ‘a most difficult and upsetting phase in my life’. Le Vell 
returned to the show after a short break and was recently involved in 
some of its main storylines.

But
earlier this month it was announced that after a review of the 
evidence, he had been charged with 19 sex offences. At the time Le Vell,
who split from Janette Beverley, his wife of 25 years, last year, said 
he intended to fight all the charges ‘vigorously’.

Court: Le Vell's hearing lasted less than ten minutes where he did not enter a plea, but his solicitor did say he would not accept the charges

He
said: ‘I am innocent of these charges and intend to fight them 
vigorously. I will now put all my efforts into clearing my name and 
proving my innocence.’

Le Vell, who trained at  Oldham Theatre Workshop, first appeared as mechanic Kevin  Webster in 1983.

One of the longest-serving actors on the soap, he has been suspended until the conclusion of the case.

An
ITV spokesman said: ‘Given the serious nature of these charges, Michael
Le Vell will not be appearing in Coronation Street pending the outcome 
of legal proceedings. It would not be appropriate for us to comment 
further at this time.’

Le Vell is due to appear at Manchester Crown Court next month.
