Stephen Waddington, 53, died from carbon monoxide poisoning after it was believed he used three disposable barbecues to cook his dinner in the living room of his Barnsley home.

A man died from carbon monoxide poisoning after it was believed he used three disposable barbecues to cook dinner in his living room.

Stephen Waddington was found slumped next to the grills and his half eaten meal by police who forced their way into his home.

The two officers who made the grim discovery required hospital treatment after being overcome by the toxic fumes.

An inquest into the 53-year-old's death, that concluded he died as a result of an accident, heard that he had been out with his brother, Andrew, on June 21 last year.

'When I left him  he spoke of his intention to have a barbecue and some beers,' he said in a statement read to the Sheffield hearing.

'He liked to have a good drink. I spoke to him on the phone at about 5pm and could tell he'd had a drink.' 

The following day, Mr Waddington's niece went to his terraced home in Barnsley, south Yorkshire, and raised the alarm because she could smell gas.

When officers arrived they broke down the door and discovered the middle aged man.

Police constable Matthew Wood said they discovered Mr Waddington surrounded by three used disposable barbecues.

'The smell got worse inside the property, it was constant,' said the officer.

'I didn't think anything of it. I was taken to hospital. We weren't in the house very long, only about a minute.'

No evidence of suspicious activity or third party involvement was found.

The court heard that unemployed Mr Waddington had become depressed after a motorcycle accident left him with his left leg in a wire cage for five years.

But his brother Andrew, added: 'Prior to his death he was happy and there were no issues, his life was getting better and better.'  

A post mortem examination concluded that Mr Waddington died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Toxicology tests found that the level of alcohol in his system would have put him twice over the drink drive limit.

Assistant coroner Louise Slater recorded a conclusion of accidental death. 

She said: 'I'm completely satisfied that Mr Waddington died as a result of a tragic accident. You were a very close family, I can see that. Please pass on my condolences to your family.

'If there are any lessons to be learned it's how dangerous it can be to have these small portable barbecues in small places.'

After the hearing, Mr Waddington's brother said: 'Stephen will be greatly missed by a lot of people.'
