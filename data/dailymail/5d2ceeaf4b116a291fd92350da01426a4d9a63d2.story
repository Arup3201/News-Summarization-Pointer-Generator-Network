'I probably kept the score under the 30s' is probably one of the least likely post-match conversations to be had by goalkeepers around the world.

But, for one, it was his silver lining after his team got thrashed 22-0 on Sunday, in what was the team's biggest defeat in its history.

Non-league Cheadle Town's spanking even ended up trending on Twitter after the friendly against Russia's Under-19s started to resemble a rugby score.

Cheadle Town could do little to prevent Russia's Under-19 national side storming to an incredible 22-0 win

Cheadle, seventh in the North West Counties League first division, suffered their heaviest defeat in history

The Stockport-based club, which plays in the North West Counties Football League, secured the prestigious fixture through club contacts and faced the team of international starlets at Park Road Stadium in Cheshire.

However, the friendly turned into somewhat of a disaster after the home side started to concede goals every couple of minutes during the 90-minute match.

Cheadle were 1-0 down after four minutes and 2-0 down by 13 minutes. From there the floodgates opened and Russia were 9-0 up at half-time.

The club's Twitter feed started trending on social media throughout the country as each goal scored was posted - punctuated with just one reference to the home side which exclaimed: 'We've got a corner!!'.

To many fans' amazement, the club's final Tweet read: 'FT: Cheadle Town 0-22 Russia U19.'

Despite the battering, goalkeeper Steve Piggott - a 35-year-old truck driver - said the team can take 'plenty of positives from the game' including his 'world class' saves.

News of Cheadle's thrashing quickly circulated on Twitter on Sunday, sending it to the top of the trending list

The club has decided to make the most of the 22-0 defeat by celebrating their Twitter followers doubling

He told The Independent: 'I pulled off a few good saves, maybe some world class ones. I probably kept the score under the 30s.

'The Russians seemed to have the wind behind them. Every shot they had in the first half seemed to hit the target.

Twitter saw 8,800 retweets for the full-time score

'Some of the lads' heads did begin to drop but I tried to keep their heads up and told them to keep going.

'There were a lot of tired legs and a few niggling injuries. We had some young players in and we weren't all used to playing together.

He also said the Russian team was 'very professional' by continuing to play to full strength and not slacking off after the score hit double figures.

Karl Florczak, Cheadle Town's website and social media manager, said it was the heaviest defeat in the club's history.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, he said: 'We played Dinamo Bucharest in a pre-season summer friendly, and there was a contact who got back in touch with us and said the Russia U19 side were knocking around in the North West and would we like to play them.

'If you are a football club at level 10 of the pyramid and someone approaches you and asks if you would like to have a go at the Russia U19s then you are not going to turn them down.

'To the best of my knowledge it is the heaviest defeat in the club's history. But in the club's defence we have three squads, the 1st XI, the reserves and also the U21s. All three squads had matches this weekend and what we put out was a bit of a scratch squad.

'To be fair, the Russia U19s were technically superb and even if we had put out our strongest XI then we would still have been on the end of a very severe beating.'

Cheadle went 1-0 down after four minutes and were 9-0 down by half-time in the club's biggest defeat in history

Goalkeeper Steve Piggott - a 35-year-old truck driver - said they can take 'plenty of positives from the game'

He added: 'Time will tell how the players will take it. They were frustrated halfway through the game, but there were a few smiles at the end, but I think we need to have a word with them before Wednesday night and remind them that it was the Russia U19 national side.

'It was a one-touch football master class. It was superb to watch for the neutral to watch, but it was not great for me as I was tweeting every goal as they went in.'

However, he did take one positive from the game – the fact the club's Twitter followers doubled by the end of the match.

'Before the game we had the region of 1,500 twitter followers, now we are knocking on the door of 3,000,' he said.

'When I posted the full time score of 22-0 it was retweeted 5,000 times.'

The club's Twitter followers were quick to join in with the fun and hundreds posted tongue-in-cheek comments.

Conor Lynn said: 'Dust yourselves down and go out again next week,' while fan Tommy said: 'Definitely deserved something from this. Gutted with the result.'

And Declan Taggart joked: 'Russia just edged it on the day.'

The club, based at the Park Road Stadium, first formed in 1961 as Grasmere Rovers.

They currently sit in sixth place in the North West Counties Football League after six games.
