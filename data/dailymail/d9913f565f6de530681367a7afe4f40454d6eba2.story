The members of Stanford's class of 2018 have some famous parents: Katie Couric and Rob Lowe both dropped off their smart children at the prestigious university on Tuesday.

Ms Couric tweeted a sweet photo of her with her 18-year-old daughter, Carrie Monahan, with the caption 'Move in day @Stanford! #goodluckclassof18!'

Stanford's location in Palo Alto, California, is conveniently close to Yahoo's headquarters in Sunnyvale. Ms Couric, 57, was named Yahoo's first Global News Anchor by the company's President and CEO Marissa Mayer in November 2013.

The Today show veteran had Carrie in 1996 with her late husband Jay Monahan, who died from colon cancer in 1998. Carrie's older sister, Ellie, graduated from Yale in 2013.

In June, Ms Couric married financier John Molner at her home in East Hampton, New York.

One of Carrie's new Stanford classmates is Mr Lowe's 18-year-old son, John Owen Lowe.

Mr Lowe shared a photo of Stanford's bizarre palm tree mascot, the latest of various iterations of the school's tree mascot.

'One of the best, (and most disturbing) mascots ever. #DropOffDay,' the 50-year-old tweeted.

Mr Lowe also Instagrammed a picture of Sheryl Berkoff, to whom he's been married since 1991, posing with their son in his new dorm room.

'This dorm was empty this morning. A mom's love and talent and a few hours later: a new home,' he captioned the photo.

John also shared a photo of him and his parents before he left for Stanford, noting that his older brother Matthew, who is currently enrolled at Duke University, was absent.

'The fam unites (minus @matthewedwardlowe ) one last to send me off...Stanford here we come.'
