Oscar Pistorius could make a sensational return to the track at this summer's World Championships after a judge today changed his bail conditions as he awaits trial for killing his girlfriend.

But UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner said it was ‘very unlikely’ Pistorius would be invited to take part in the London Anniversary Games at the end of July.

Lawyers for the 'Blade Runner', who was not in court for the hearing, applied for the conditions to be changed to allow Pistorius to travel abroad to compete.

The 26-year-old is on bail after being charged with the premeditated murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead at his home in Pretoria last month.

Verdict: Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius successfully appealed against some of his bail restrictions on Thursday

Pistorius is likely to stand trial before 
the end of the year, the High Court in Pretoria heard today, and his 
next court appearance is on June 4.

Meanwhile,
Pistorius' agent, Peet van Zyl, said soon after the ruling that his 
client could even run at the world championships in Moscow in August and
the IAAF later confirmed he would be allowed to compete.

'Based on this (judge's decision), and if he is up for it and qualifies,
the world championships will definitely be on the radar,' Van Zyl said.

'He's going to be the one that determines running and training. It's his call. He's the one under all the pressure for the 
court case and grieving for Reeva.'

But speaking to Sky News, Pistorius' uncle Arnold Pistorius indicated that thoughts of a comeback were far from uppermost in the mind of his nephew, who is likely to stand trial before the end of the year and is next due in court on June 4.

'We know Oscar cannot go anywhere in the world because everybody will recognise him. He doesn't want to go anywhere and he doesn't want to go into public life because he's not ready - he's absolutely not ready to do that,' he said.

'Oscar's got no intention to travel overseas now - he needs his family. I can't see him getting along without the support of his family.'

Pressed further on whether his nephew could return to the track soon, he replied: 'Not in the near future. Not realistic. I don't think so.'

Arnold Pistorius admitted, however, 
that it was only a matter of time before Oscar would have to return to 
the track if he is to retain any chance of competing on the global 
stage.

'In the future, perhaps yes. I would like to say that,' he said.

'Knowledgeable people tell me that if
a super athlete doesn't train for a year, he'll never get back to what 
he was, so we tried to convince him to get back into training.

'He knows that he'll have to do that.
If he ever wants to run again he'll have to get back to training, 
otherwise he will just not be able to get back on track.'

The judge also ruled in favor 
of Pistorius on three other conditions. He no longer has to be regularly
supervised by a probation official and a ban against him drinking 
alcohol was lifted.

Bam also slammed one of the bail conditions imposed by another judge, saying that a condition that he would be in breach of his bail if he was accused of another crime against women was 'fraud.'

It went against Pistorius' constitutional right to be innocent until proven guilty, and being accused of a crime should not count against him, Bam said in a ruling that came three hours after the hearing began.

Pistorius, a double amputee and 
six-time Paralympic sprint champion, claims he shot 30-year-old Ms 
Steenkamp after mistaking her for an intruder.

He was released on bail by magistrate
Desmond Nair last month on a number of conditions, including having to 
surrender his passport and to report to police twice a week.

His lawyer Barry Roux today asked 
for several conditions to be relaxed, saying Pistorius - who has been 
staying with relatives - was effectively under 'house arrest'.

Judge Bert Bam granted the appeal, 
saying there was no reason Pistorius should not be allowed to leave the 
country if he was invited to compete abroad.

But the star must provide a copy of his itinerary to officials before he plans to travel, the judge ruled.

Earlier this week Ms Steenkamp's parents June and Barry spoke of their grief over her death.

Mrs Steenkamp told Grazia magazine: 
'He (Pistorius) still has his thoughts. He still has to answer for this.
I don't want anything from him. What could he say to me? My daughter is
dead and nothing is going to change that. I don't ever want to see him.

'My biggest regret is that Reeva will never have a wedding day. She'll never have a child. This is for ever. It's the end.'

Pistorius's brother Carl yesterday 
appeared in court in a separate case, in which he is charged with the 
culpable homicide of a female motorcyclist in a 2008 road crash.

He pleaded not guilty and is due to appear in court again next week.
