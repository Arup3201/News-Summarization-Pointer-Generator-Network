How's your day: typical, particularly good or particularly bad?

Researchers at the Pew Research Center have posed this question to some 48,542 people in 44 countries.

The results show Americans are significantly more positive about how their days are going — standing out in stark contrast to most other rich nations.

The research shows just how much of an outlier the U.S. is, standing out in stark contrast with other rich nations where people are much less likely to feel upbeat about their days

Some 41 percent of Americans said they were having good days, while 49 percent said they were having a typical day.

About 8 percent said they were having a bad day.

But, he added, 'The U.S. is a major outlier on this measure.

'It has the highest GDP per capita among the countries surveyed and Americans were more likely to rate a day as particularly good than people in other rich nations.'

Overall, about a quarter of people surveyed said their day was going 'particularly well' and fewer than 10 percent said their day was going poorly.

People in Africa and Latin America were more likely to be cheerful about how their days were going.

More than half the people surveyed in Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, Nigeria and Colombia said they were having a particularly good day.

Downbeat moods were most common in Egypt and Jordan, with about a third of the people saying they were having a 'particularly bad day.'
