Many of us feel passionately about our choice of condiments, but few could claim to be as obsessed as one woman who eats tomato ketchup at least three times a day.

Melissa Ibbitson, 19, just can't get enough of the red sauce and eats ketchup with almost every meal.

She loves tomato sauce so much that she has even walked out of a restaurant because they didn't stock it.

Melissa just cant get enough ketchup, adding it to almost every meal

Melissa loves tomato sauce so much that she has even walked out of a restaurant because they didn't stock her favourite condiment

The theology student, from Lincoln, has been a ketchup fan her whole life, but her addiction really gathered pace four years ago and she now gets through three bottles a week - which adds up to 11st a year, more than her own body weight.

Melissa said: 'I started eating ketchup when I was a kid and we first went to McDonalds.

'I can't remember how it became such an obsession but now I can't live without it.

'My friends get really embarrassed when I ask for 12 sachets for my meals at the student's union, and I'll get extras to take home with me.

'I eat so much of the stuff - I dread to think what it's doing to my body.'

With the average bottle of ketchup costing £1.85, the average year's supply sets her back about £300

The tomato sauce addict says she dare not think about how much she spends on the sauce - but, with the average bottle of ketchup costing £1.85, a year's supply will set her back about £300.

She said: 'Heinz tomato sauce is my favourite, but as a student I sometimes can't afford to be picky.

'I would rather have a brand that isn't Heinz than no ketchup at all.

'I pick up sachets anywhere I can - the union, the pub, fast food chains - it's the best way to keep my costs to a minimum.'

Melissa's obsession with the sauce has no limits - she had a birthday cake shaped like a ketchup bottle last year and even gets ketchup-themed presents for Christmas.

Melissa's obsession has prompted friends to give her ketchup-themed gifts, such as this personalised bottle (right) which she received for her birthday

She owns an 'I love ketchup' tea towel, a personalised ketchup bottle and a ketchup-bottle shaped tin.

Melissa said: 'When I lived at home my mum used to get annoyed with me. I would get through the ketchup quicker than she could get to the shop to buy it.

'Since I've moved out and have been making my own meals I've got even worse.

'For breakfast I'll have spaghetti or beans on toast with ketchup, lunch will be a sandwich with ketchup and I have ketchup with whatever I have for dinner.'

Although Melissa does like other condiments, she says nothing compares to her love for tomato sauce.

She said: 'I like brown sauce and mayonnaise but it's quite rare that I eat that compared to how much ketchup I eat.

'My favourite thing to eat with ketchup is chips - I won't eat them without it.

'I've tried ketchup with more or less everything and it goes better with some things than others.

'I have it with my roast dinner and gravy some times, and it goes really well with salad.'
