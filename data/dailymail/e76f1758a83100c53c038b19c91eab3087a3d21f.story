The childhood home of Grace Kelly was at the center of a rescue operation on Thursday as Pennsylvania SPCA officers found 14 cats and an elderly woman living in deplorable conditions.

The 81-year-old homeowner was taken away for psychiatric evaluation after the flea-ridden animals were found in the East Falls, Philadelphia house.

Conditions inside the house were not fit for the owner, Majorie Bamont, or the malnourished animals being kept there, animal rescue officers said.

SPCA: 'The conditions inside the property, fleas, feces everywhere in the house, it's just totally unsanitary.' The SPCA had complaints about Bamont's home for close to a decade but officers could never get inside

They had been trying to gain access to the landmark home for months, after receiving numerous complaints.

On Thursday an officer spotted a dead cat in the porch and, when staff went inside they discovered 14 others that looked sick, according to CBS Philly.

'A lot of them were very thin in need of medical care,' George Bengal, of Pennsylvania SPCA, said.

He added that the woman used to run a rescue center but it had 'turned into a hoarder situation'.

Rescue staff described the house, built by Grace Kelly's father in 1929, as being covered in cat waste and infested with fleas.

Ms Bamont, who could face animal cruelty charges, bought the property in 1973 and was living there alone.

The
house is a landmark property because of its links to movie-star turned 
princess Grace Kelly, who went from a Hollywood career to being Princess
of Monaco.

Icon: Grace Kelly was born in Philadelphia to John Brendan "Jack" Kelly, and his wife, Margaret Katherine Majer. She grew up at the home in the suburbs

One of her neighbors, Alexis Franklin, told Fox 29: 'She was always an animal lover and dog rescuer. People have been known to drive up to her property and drop off cats and dogs not upon request, and she was good at finding homes for them.'

She added: 'It's pretty sad. I know 
she's aging so it may have to do with age and not having the ability to 
do what she used to.'

Ms Bamont has been involuntarily committed according to Fox 29.
