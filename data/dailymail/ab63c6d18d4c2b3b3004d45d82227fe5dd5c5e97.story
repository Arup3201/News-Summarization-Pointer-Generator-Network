The Lockerbie bombing was ordered by Iran and carried out by a Syrian-based terror group, an Iranian defector has claimed.

Britain’s worst terror atrocity, in which 270 people died when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded above the Scottish town in December 1988, has always been blamed on Libya.

But a former Iranian intelligence agent – now living under a witness protection scheme in Germany – has said publicly for the first time that the attack was ordered by Iran in revenge for the accidental downing of an Iranian commercial jet by the US Navy in 1988.

It is also claimed that the bomb was placed on the doomed flight at Heathrow, rather than in Malta as had been thought.

Tragedy: The wreckage of Pan Am 103, the bombed airliner which exploded over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 243 passengers, 16 crew and a further 11 people on the ground

It was carried out by Palestinian terrorists based in Syria, he says, and not on the orders of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The atrocity killed 243 passengers, 16 crew and a further 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie.

Ex-spy Abolghassem Mesbahi claims in a documentary aired tonight on Al Jazeera that former Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini wanted to mirror the 1988 US strike on an Iranian Airbus and recruited a Syrian-based group to plan an attack.

Mesbahi, who defected to Germany in the 1990s, said that the supreme leader, who died in 1989, wanted revenge.

He told documentary makers from Al Jazeera: ‘Iran decided to retaliate as soon as possible. The decision was made by the whole system in Iran and confirmed by Ayatollah Khomeni.

The target…was to copy exactly what happened to the Iranian Airbus. Everything exactly the same, minimum 290 people dead.’

Evidence unearthed by the 
documentary-makers includes the names of four suspects belonging to the 
Syrian-based radical group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine – General Command.

The individuals were allegedly responsible for devising the plot, making the bomb and planting it.

The programme suggests that the plot was hatched at a secret meeting in Malta, attended by representatives from the Libyan, Syrian and Iranian regimes.

Ahmed Jibril, the Syrian head of the 
PFLP-GC is named as the plot’s mastermind. He recruited Hafez Dalkamoni,
 a Palestinian, and Jordanian bomb-maker Marwan Khreesat.

These two were arrested by German police, who discovered four bombs, months before Lockerbie.

However,
 it is claimed that a fifth bomb was made and used for the Lockerbie 
attack. Another man, Abu Talb is named as the bomb’s alleged courier.

Mesbahi’s claims raise new questions about the guilt of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, an intelligence officer serving Colonel Gaddafi, who was convicted of mass murder in 2001.

It has been asserted that Gaddafi devised the attack in retaliation for the US bombing of Libya in 1986. Despite Megrahi’s conviction, many – including some families of the dead – remain unconvinced that the whole truth has been uncovered.

Megrahi maintained his innocence until he died in 2012.

Mourners at the funeral service in Tehran for those who died when the Iran Air passenger jet was shot down over the Gulf

On July 3, 1988 an Iranian passenger jet was shot down by an American naval warship patrolling the Persian Gulf, killing all on board.

Iran Air flight 655 had been travelling from Bandar Abbas in Iran to Dubai when it was shot down by the  USS Vincennes, resulting in the deaths of 290 civilians from six countries, including 66 children.

The USS Vincennes had tracked the plane electronically and warned it to 
keep away. When it did not the ship fired two surface-to-air missiles at the Airbus A300 B2-203, carrying many Iranians on their way to Mecca.

The attack still has the highest death toll of any aviation incident involving an Airbus A300, and any such incident in the Indian Ocean.

An official inquiry carried out by the US attributed the mistake to 
human error, saying that the crew had incorrectly identified the plane as a F-14 Tomcat fighter, and that the flight did not identify itself otherwise.

However, the Iranian government has always disputed the American
 version of events, with many claiming that the attack was purposeful, and a sign that the US can not be trusted in its dealings with the country.

The black box flight recorder on board the Airbus was never found, so it is unknown whether the crew ignored the American warnings via distress frequencies, or did not hear them.

Iran Air continues to use flight number IR655 on the route as a memorial to the victims (file photo)

It was only in 1992 that the US officially admitted that the vessel had been in  Iranian waters after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats for operating within Iranian territory.

In 1996 the US agreed to pay Iran $61.8 million in compensation for the 248 Iranians
 killed, plus the cost of the aircraft and legal expenses.

It had already paid a further $40 million to the other countries whose nationals were killed. To date a formal apology has not been issued by the US for the tragedy.

Some believe the Lockerbie bombing, carried out six months later in December 1988, was masterminded by Iranians in revenge for the Airbus tragedy, although a Libyan man was convicted and jailed in 2001.

Going against an informal convention to discontinue flight numbers associated with aviation tragedies, Iran Air continues to use flight number IR655 on the route as a memorial to the victims.
