When American singer Madonna married British film director Guy Ritchie  and decamped to London, she picked up more than a penchant for real ale.

Her accent took on a strange, clipped English tone. And she’s not the only one. Kelly Osbourne seems to swing from cockney rebel, like her rocker dad Ozzy, to Los Angeles drawl, while former MasterChef host Loyd Grossman has the most bizarre of all ‘mid-Atlantic’ accents.

At the other end of the spectrum, Cheryl Cole’s strong Geordie accent allegedly made her so difficult to understand while hosting American X Factor that she was fired.

Language barrier: Madonna picked up an English accent from her ex-husband, and although born in England, after growing up on a tourbus and in LA, it is no surprise Kelly Osbourne's speech is a bit mixed-up

A fickle accent is not just a celebrity malady – new research has shown Glaswegians are picking  up London inflections, apparently from watching EastEnders. So why do some people’s accents seem to change, depending on who they are with, while others retain theirs?

Here, Jane Stuart-Smith, Professor of English Language at Glasgow University, explains why our accents are so fickle .  .  .

Why do accents change?

Every time we speak to someone we make tiny adjustments in our speech. We either move away from or towards their manner of speaking. It’s not just accent that changes, but phrases and words too. 

Sometimes these changes are noticeable (ever been embarrassed by accidentally sounding as though you’re mimicking somebody with a strong accent?), but usually changes are too slight to pick up without recording and analysing speech.

Does our accent change  on a more permanent basis?

Absolutely.
Over time, adjustments become embedded in our linguistic system, 
especially if you move abroad or to another part of the country.

It can take a few weeks or months, or not happen for many years, depending how much you are immersed in the accent.

If I watch lots of American films will I develop an accent?

It’s unlikely that too many episodes of Friends will make you sound  like a New Yorker, though you will probably pick up some inflections and slang.

Our accents alter over time as we hear different things,  but TV and radio merely provide an amplifying effect to changes already under way.

In Glasgow, for example, the speech shifts we found were already occurring: EastEnders has just speeded them up.

Do we pick up accents because we want to be like someone?

It depends on how engaged you are in a programme. If you have a favourite character, you’re more likely to copy their accent, but the news will have little impact on your speech because you aren’t identifying with the presenter or their life.

Do we all flit from  accent to accent?

No. We all have an accent norm, developed mainly from our parents and peers as we grew up. Generally we are talking to people with accents similar to our own. And as we speak, we are listening to our own voice and that reinforces our own accent.

Why do some people hold their accents but others don’t?

It depends on the individual. There are differences in our capacity to imitate others. Taking on a new accent is a mental rather than  a physical shift – we’re simply copying body language, as that is what speech ultimately is.

It’s also down to how much contact you’re having with different accents. If you are only with locals, then speech will adapt much more quickly than if you are surrounded by a network of colleagues or family with your own accent.

Are there general patterns of accent change in the UK?

Yes. Consonants seem to be changing quite rapidly, and certain consonant features seem to have spread out from the London area and are now found right across the country. For example, this includes saying ‘fink’ for ‘think’. Vowels are less prone to change at a local level. If you get a train from Glasgow to London and hop out at every station, vowels sound completely different as you descend the country. There  is a lot of levelling in the South East of England, though – around London accents are very similar.

Can you develop foreign accents after brain damage?

Foreign Accent Syndrome is well documented, but it doesn’t happen as you’d think. I studied a woman who woke up with a Scottish accent after a stroke, and when we actually analysed her speech we found only a few small sounds were really the same as a Scottish accent. However, those subtle changes were enough for her to sound Scottish to people listening to her speak.

Just as with visual perception, where we don’t need many elements to see a face, our brain receives small amounts of audio information and makes sense of it by interpreting an accent. The tiny changes in her voice were probably brought on by some kind of speech production change, caused by the stroke.
