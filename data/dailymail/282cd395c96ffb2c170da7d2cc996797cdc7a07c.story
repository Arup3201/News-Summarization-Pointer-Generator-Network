More people now live in London than at any point in history, Boris Johnson revealed today.

The London Mayor announced 8.615million people call the capital home, overtaking the pre-Second World War peak.

Growing numbers of people moving to London and having children mean than the population is on course to hit 11million by 2050.

The population of London has now passed its 1939 peak and is on course to hit 11million by 2050

The Greater London Authority says this city now has its 8,615,246th inhabitant, the highest population since the eve of the war in 1939.

Mr Johnson said: 'London's incredible population boom is testament to the fact that this is the best big city on the planet.

'With more green space than any other European city, a thriving economy, a low crime rate and a roaring cultural scene it is no surprise that London is the place to be.

'As our incredible city continues to grow, Londoners should rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide the homes, water, energy, schools, transport, digital connectivity and better quality of life they expect.'

He called on the government to give London greater control of its finances to fund infrastructure 'that is so vital to stimulate jobs'.

Mr Johnson added: 'It is crucial that we recognise the amazing opportunities that this kind of growth can offer and step up our investment now so that London continues to be the motor of the UK economy.'

Latest population figures show how London's population has expanded almost 2million people in the last 25 years.

The borough of Hillingdon, in west London, has seen the most growth since 1939, up 82 per cent from 159,000 people to 289,000 in 2015.

However, in a sign of the shifting shape of the capital, some areas have seen a drop in population. 

Islington in north London saw a 36 per cent drop between 1939 and 2015, down from 343,000 to 221,000.

Barnet likely to overtake Croydon to become the borough with the most residents at almost 400,000 people. 

Experts have warned that this could add massive strains to already stressed infrastructure, particularly housing and transport. 

The biggest pressure is expected to be on housing, with an estimated 42,000 new homes needed every year to keep pace with population growth. 

The last population peak came after two decades of massive growth.

But it began to fall almost immediately after the outbreak of war in September. This was largely due to evacuations and conscription.

Even after the war, the population continued to decline, amid encouragement from planners for families to relocate.   

The last time London's population peaked was in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War. But how different was the UK's capital city back then?

Currently, 13 per cent of people living in the UK are London inhabitants, whereas the London population accounted for 18 per cent of the UK in 1939.

At that time, London was overwhelmingly white - only 2.7 per cent had been born abroad. Today, around 37 per cent of Londoners were born abroad.

In 1939, with no NHS and heavy smog, life expectancy was 62. Today, Londoners can expect to live to 82.

The population pyramid shows London now has fewer teenagers and more pensioners than in 1939. There are also have more adult men, due to a 'missing generation' in 1939, after the First World War.

In 1939, statutory education only went up to age 14, so most of London's  secondary schools had yet to be built.

Before the war, only 2 per cent of people went to university and almost all of them were men. In London today, 43 per cent of people go onto university and the majority of them are women.

Although the number of people working in London has not changed greatly, the industries which cater for those jobs have.

In 1939, around one in three people worked in manufacturing. Now 90 per cent of these manufacturing jobs have gone and most people now work in industries that barely existed in 1939.

These include 250,000 jobs in IT, with another 250,000 working in hotels and restaurants.

St Paul's was the tallest building in the capital In 1939. Now St Paul's is only the 41st tallest building in the London. The tallest building is The Shard. 

House prices have also grown extraordinarily. In 1939, the average cost of a home was the equivalent of three years' salary; now it is around 16 years.
