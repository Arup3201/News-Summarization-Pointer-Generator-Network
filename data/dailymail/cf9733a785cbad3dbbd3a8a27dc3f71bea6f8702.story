Found: Police say they have found missing 10-year-old Malakhi Chijiutomi-Ghosh

A seriously-ill ten-year-old who sparked a huge hunt when he went missing this morning has been found miles from his home.

Malakhi Chijiutomi-Ghosh, who suffers from Adrenal Hyperplasia, left his home in Thornton Heath, south London at around 6am this morning.

He was this afternoon found by an off-duty police officer in Hertfordshire.

A police spokesman said: 'Malakhi Chijiutomi-Ghosh has been found this afternoon by an off duty police officer in Hertfordshire.

'He has been taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.'

Earlier today, police urgently appealed for anyone who may have seen the runaway to come forward.

His disappearance was said to be completely out of character and his family were 'distraught'.

Their worry had been made all the worse by the fact that Malakhi suffers from Adrenal Hyperplasia which requires medication three times per day.

A boy matching his description had been seen at a bus stop in Streatham Common at 8am, an hour after CCTV spotted him in Thornton Heath High Street heading towards the railway station.

A Scotland Yard spokesman had said earlier today: 'It is vital that he is found so that medication can be administered. Having received no medication today there is a very real chance that he may have already fallen into a coma.'

Police officers were seen searching parks in south London before the news came through that he had been found. 

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (COH) is a genetic condition causing swelling of the adrenal glands.

It leads to a decrease in the blood level of cortisol, the stress hormone, and an increase in the levels of other hormones.

Lacking cortisol means that the body is less able to cope with stress, either emotionally or physically, which can be life threatening.

Children with CAH need to have their hormone levels regularly monitored and are prescribed drugs to replacement cortisol and aldosterone, which they take every day for the rest of their lives.

CAH affects between one in 10,000 and one in 18,000 children born each year.
