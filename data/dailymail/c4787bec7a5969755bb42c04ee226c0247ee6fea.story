The world’s first seven-star hotel has created the ‘ultimate experience’ for children – including 24-carat gold iPads, a personal butler and a private beach where ice lollies are free of charge.

Dubai’s iconic Burj Al Arab is launching the Spoilt Rotten service, which includes round-the-clock in-suite entertainment, a turn-down service and daily visits from a sweet train.

The package is free of charge to parents booking a suite costing from £1,100 a night at the hotel which proclaims it is the most luxurious in the world, with 202 suites each boasting a Jacuzzi.

As well as private pool access, complimentary access to an indoor play area and in-room iMacs, PlayStations and Xboxes, children will also have their own stretch of sand, where popcorn and drinks are on tap.

Those with an environmental conscience staying at the Burj Al Arab - standing at 321 metres high and designed to resemble a billowing sail - can enjoy the delights of a visit to Jumeirah Group’s Dubai Turtle Rehabilitation Project. 

While for kids with energy to burn, Wild Wadi Waterpark or Sinbad’s Kids’ Club is a three-minute private buggy ride away.

Heinrich Morio, the general manager of Burj Al Arab, said: ‘Luxury doesn’t have an age limit.

‘It is our job to create the ultimate experience for every Burj Al Arab guest.

‘Our colleagues have a lot of fun finding imaginative and exhilarating ways to surprise and delight our youngest guests. 

‘We empower our colleagues to find unique ways to “wow” children; seeing the child’s excited reaction is as rewarding for us as it is for the child.’

The Burj Al Arab boasts the highest guest-to-staff ratio, with eight employees to each suite, ensuring that all their guests have a memorable experience. 

‘In our own UAE community and within our GCC community we appreciate that there are a lot of parents with young families who are looking for that extra special vacation,’ Morio added.

‘It is our experience that happy children make happy parents so it’s natural that we want to go that extra mile.’
