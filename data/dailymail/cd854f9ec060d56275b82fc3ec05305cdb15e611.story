Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale was controversially stopped from receiving the biggest prize in county cricket on Friday and could be facing further punishment over his suspension for the rest of the season.

Yorkshire’s first title success for 13 years was tainted when their captain was banned from taking any part in the presentation ceremony after their victory against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.

The move by the ECB, which followed Gale’s ban last week for verbally abusing Lancashire’s Ashwell Prince, angered Yorkshire and their captain, who was said to be in tears in the dressing room while his stand-in Joe Root received the trophy instead.

Yet the ECB, who came under fire for being too harsh on Gale, were preparing a statement which Sportsmail understands could explain their decision while also causing more controversy over the season’s climax.

It was only after the official presentation that Gale, highly regarded for his leadership of Yorkshire, went onto the Trent Bridge outfield and lifted the trophy after being urged to do so by his county’s large travelling support. He also looked emotional while carrying his daughter around the outfield.

‘We only found out he couldn’t lift the trophy last night,’ said Martyn Moxon, the Yorkshire director of cricket. ‘We can’t say anything else because there’s a legal process going on. It’s been hard for Andrew because he’s cherished this win and was looking forward to this moment.’

Gale was banned until September 27 on a level Two charge after clashing angrily with Prince on the penultimate night of the Roses match. Sportsmail understands he made reference to the South African’s Kolpak status, which allows him to play for Lancashire as a non-overseas player.

In Gale’s absence Yorkshire needed just over an hour of the final day of their match to take the remaining five Notts wickets and win the championship with a match in hand. It is a notable triumph for a county brimming with potential England players and their brilliant coach Jason Gillespie.

But it was tarnished by the treatment of Gale and the story could take another controversial turn later on Friday.
