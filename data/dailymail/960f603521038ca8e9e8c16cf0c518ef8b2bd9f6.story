If England need any encouragement ahead of what looks like a decisive Group D clash against Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday then they really need only look at Saturday’s match tape from the Estadio Castelao.

For a team ranked seventh on the FIFA list ahead of this World Cup, Uruguay were feeble in losing against unfancied Costa Rica. Even their rather grumpy coach Oscar Tabarez admitted he was concerned about the way they had played and, in particular, their defending.

‘We didn’t expect this to happen, conceding goals in situations where we hadn’t before,’ said Tabarez. ‘We started leaving space and they benefited from the space; they took over.

‘The goals 
are the visible result of a whole series of things that came before. As 
the coach I am ultimately responsible, but there is a disappointment 
when you concede goals like that.

‘We have to improve against England, recover ground we have lost.’

Despite scoring the game’s first goal, Uruguay lost control of the midfield in the second half and never got it back.

Costa
 Rica were able to break on the South Americans with ease and Uruguay’s 
cause was not helped by some rather lamentable attempts to defend 
set-pieces. Roy Hodgson and his staff will have noted this like the rest
 of us and it’s inconceivable that Steven Gerrard will not spend some 
time on his dead-ball deliveries this week.

Uruguay
 have issues with discipline, too. They lost defender Maxi Pereira to 
the World Cup’s first red card deep in stoppage-time when the game was 
lost. It was an ugly swipe at the ankles of young Arsenal forward Joel 
Campbell and was indicative of Uruguay’s darkening mood.

The
 talking point ahead of the England game, of course, will be the fitness
 of Liverpool’s Luis  Suarez. Without him they really are half the team
 they can be. Former Manchester United  forward Diego Forlan remains a 
willing worker but  limitations remain in his game.

Despite
 Tabarez’s claims on Saturday, Suarez is still not fully fit. It would 
be an enormous  surprise, though, if he does not replace Forlan in Sao 
Paulo, a game his country really must win.

As
 for Costa Rica, they will move forward with real hope now. Unlike 
Saturday’s opponents they benefit from a genuine sense of unity and in  
21-year-old Campbell they have a striker with a real point to prove. 
Loaned out to Spain and Greece by Arsene Wenger, he will return to 
Arsenal after this tournament.

Costa
 Rica assistant coach Paulo Wanchope said: ‘He really wants to go back 
to Arsenal and play and I told him that the only way to do that is on 
the pitch. He did well today and I think that he needs to perform even 
better against Italy and then England to have that chance to go back to 
Arsenal.’
