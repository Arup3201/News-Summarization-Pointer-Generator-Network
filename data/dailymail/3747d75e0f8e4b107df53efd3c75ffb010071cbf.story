We had seen the celebration before: teeth gritted, fists clenched, arms whirling like propellers demanding one more effort.

When Steven Gerrard, who on Monday was spotted sporting a jumper emblazoned with James Dean's image, emerged from a huddle of cavorting red shirts to salute the Kop, having just given his team-mates an emotional call to arms, memories of that heady night in Istanbul nine years ago came flooding back.

That night, you will remember, he scored the first goal in Liverpool’s logic-defying comeback against AC Milan in the Champions League final with a terrific header then implored those supporters who had travelled to Turkey to raise themselves.

Their backing was crucial but the main
 reason Liverpool became champions of Europe for the fifth time was 
because Gerrard was at his rampaging, brilliant best; when he built up a
 head of steam, AC Milan could not stop him.

Gerrard
 catapulted himself into realms of legends in the Ataturk Stadium and 
cemented his position 12 months later with another performance against 
West Ham United in the FA Cup final that was trademarked by Roy Race.

Should
 he lead Liverpool to the title this season, and crown an extraordinary 
career with the one gong that has proven so elusive, he will have to be 
recognised as the greatest player of the Barclays Premier League era.

Remember this? Gerrard's celebrations after the City win were reminiscent of those after Liverpool won the 2005 Champions League in dramatic circumstances against AC Milan in Istanbul

The
 competition for that accolade is huge when you consider the candidates.
 Thierry Henry, for instance, was the most complete striker this country
 has seen, an exhilarating blend of speed, skill and strength, who led 
Arsenal’s line with class and distinction.

Alan
 Shearer was a goal-machine who carried Blackburn to the title in 1995, 
served England proudly, then immortalised himself on his native Tyneside with his exploits for Newcastle. He would have won more medals 
going elsewhere but his reputation was never diminished.

Then
 there is Ryan Giggs, who has been a fixture in the Premier League since
 its inception, a man who has a personal trophy cabinet that many clubs 
would pay king’s ransom for. He is now 40 but remains Manchester 
United’s best player.

Others
 deserve, of course, mentioning. Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira; 
Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane; Frank Lampard, John Terry
 and Gianfranco Zola. All these men have made unforgettable 
contributions to the English game and defined their stellar careers with
 silverware.

Magician: Thierry Henry illuminated the Premier League with his breath-taking pace and spectacular goals

Prolific: Alan Shearer is the Premier League's top goalscorer with 260 for Blackburn and Newcastle

Longevity: Ryan Giggs has played in every season during the Premier League era for Manchester United

Yet should 
Gerrard, who has reinvented himself this season as a deep-lying 
midfielder and is flourishing in the role, win the league, he would 
stand apart.

For all that 
Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have been sensational, do not mistake 
that Gerrard is the driving force in this title charge and he is 
performing with the same grit and hunger that was so evident on the road
 to Istanbul.

You only needed to see him charging into tackles and bombing forward against City to realise how much this means to him.

It
 was captured, perfectly, in that huddle, when he called his team-mates 
together and implored them to remain focused as they close in on 
history.

Pure emotion: Gerrard wiped away the tears before delivering a stirring post-match team talk to his players

Leader: Gerrard delivered an impassioned speech saying the players needed to keep their feet on the ground

He has hit a 
number of Liverpool landmarks recently, leapfrogging Kenny Dalglish in the list of
 all time scorers and moving alongside Ray Clemence and Emlyn Hughes on 
665 appearances, but the one that he craves most of all, the one he has 
chased since he emerged as a spindly-legged 18-year-old, is ending the 
drought that goes back to 1990.

'You
 know what I said to those players in that huddle,’ Gerrard said. ‘I 
think the important thing now is not to get carried away by that result.
 We need to stay calm, focused and we’ve got all week to prepare for 
Norwich, they are fighting for their lives.

'We
 showed that against Fulham, West Ham and Sunderland, on our journey 
that those teams are just as tough. The scenes were and obviously the 
fans are very happy. But we’ve got the day off tomorrow and then we get 
ready for Norwich.’

And that is typical Gerrard, never switching off until the job has been done. It is why, as a talent, he has been incomparable.
