Jose Mourinho insists his relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo is 'non-existent' since he left Real Madrid and returned to Chelsea in 2013.

Mourinho won the Spanish La Liga title once during his three years at the Bernabeu with compatriot Ronaldo as his star forward.

But despite describing the Portuguese World Player of the Year as a 'goal machine' and wishing him the best in club and international football, Mourinho says: 'You would not find us hanging around together.'

'The relationship does not exist,' Mourinho told Portugal's TV1. 'He plays for Real Madrid and I'm at Chelsea. You would not find us hanging around together.

'I remember the good and the not so good. I remember that he is a goal machine, he helped me to become a champion, to win the cup and the Super Cup. 

'He probably also helped him and each of us to make history in winning the league with 100 points against the best Barcelona side in history. 

'Cristiano Ronaldo gives me great memories and I wish him all the best in his career, for his country and for his club, because when I go to a club I go with a sense of belonging and wish my former players continued success.'

Mourinho said he was proud of his record at Real and would return to the Spanish giants if given a second chance, but refused to discuss the reasons behind his exit.

'On one hand I achieved a goal: to win three championships that I consider the most important in the world (England, Italy and Spain). That goal was important.'

'Yes, definitely (I would go back). It was an experience as a man and as a coach that I would repeat again without thinking twice.' 

The Portuguese manager revealed that he would love to return to rejoin Real Madrid if possible

'Yes, definitely (I would go back). It was an experience as a man and as a coach that I would repeat again without thinking twice.

'You won't hear me talk about what happened in the past, whether it be positive or negative. I left Real Madrid with a fantastic relationship with the president, the executive director and the entire club after making a decision which was best for my career. 

'I am a happy man, I am going to matches and training with great joy and I am not a person who likes to be talking about the past.' 

The Chelsea boss also admitted his return to Stamford Bridge at the beginning of last season was unplanned, and that he was surprised to have the chance to sign Cesc Fabregas in the summer.

Fabregas, who has made a superb start to his Premier League return, was Arsenal captain before moving to Barcelona in 2011.

The Chelsea manager is very happy to be back at his old club with a 'different project' in progress

'This is the only time that I'm not thinking about the next stage of my career,' said Mourinho. 'Before I always thought about what would come next. 

'Without being planned, I'm back. I prefer it as a place to work and for my family and social life. I returned here because the club has a different project. In my first spell Financial Fair Play did not exist.'

'For me it was a surprise that he (Fabregas) came. We knew the type of player that we wanted but I never thought there was a chance Fabregas would come. 

'I always thought he would stay in Barcelona, or if he returned to England it would be with Arsenal. 

'When we knew it was possible it completed the jigsaw, leaving us with a team that still has many years to grow with its own identity.'
