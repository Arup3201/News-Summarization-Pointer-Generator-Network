A toddler is today fighting for life after being hit by her own family's car after it rolled forwards and crushed her.

The unnamed little girl, who is 19 months old, suffered head injuries after the red Vauxhall Zafira hit her at 'slow speed' in a Devon car park.

Police have said she suffered 'life-changing injuries' in the unfortunate incident.

She was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital, in Bristol, where it is understood she was put in a medically induced coma. Her injuries are said to include swelling on her brain.

The incident happened in the car park at the YMCA John Kitto Centre in Plymouth, Devon, at 9.35am on Sunday.

The family of six, including three girls and a boy, was going to an invitational tournament hosted by Plymouth Roller Hockey Club.

Three teams from Plymouth and one each from Middlesbrough and Halifax, in West Yorkshire.

The family involved in the incident is said to be from Middlesbrough.

A member of staff at the YMCA centre gave first aid before an ambulance arrived.

'I kept her awake and still,' said the worker, who asked not to be named.

'Her father was on the phone calling the ambulance.

'The ambulance was here in three or four minutes and there were two police cars.'

Emergency: The Devon Air Ambulance was called in to help the girl with 'life-changing injuries'

The girl was taken to Derriford Hospital, Plymouth and later transferred by helicopter to the Bristol infirmary which has a specialist neurosciences department.

The unit is the regional centre for neurological services for the South West.

The cause of the incident is not yet known and police are appealing for witnesses.

About 45 children aged from ten to 13 were taking part in the roller hockey tournament.

Organisers of the event said that the teams from the North spent the night in Plymouth on Saturday before competing on Sunday.

By late afternoon the only reminder of the incident was some police incident tape in the car park.
