Jailed: Samuel Myatt killed his best friend in a horrific high-spped crash after tailgating a motorist for two miles

A reckless driver who killed his best friend in a horrific high-speed crash has been jailed for more than three years.

Samuel Myatt, who was 19 at the time, was tailgating another motorist for two miles before overtaking on a blind bend and ploughing his Ford Fiesta into a tree.

His best friend, Scott Fairlie, 19, was in the front passenger seat and was killed instantly in the crash on November 3 last year.

The friends had been chasing another motorist, Liam Slaney, for two miles before overtaking on a notorious S-bend on the A522 near Cheadle, Staffs.

Myatt, now 20, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for 40 months at Stafford Crown Court.

Sentencing him, Judge Mark Eades told him: 'Scott was your friend, he had his whole life in front of him and as a result of your actions he has lost his life and his family and friends have got to live with that loss. The scars will last forever.

'You were driving on a road you knew well, you knew where the double white lines were, but you continued to tailgate. You persisted over a two-mile distance.

'You were egging the other driver on, a deliberate act to provoke a reaction. He didn't respond, so you chose to overtake. The position was highly dangerous, on an S-bend.

'This was a wholly avoidable accident caused by your impetuous driving.'

The court heard Myatt repeatedly revved his engine and pursued Mr Slaney for two miles before the fatal crash.

After the crash, Mr Slaney told police: 'He floored the accelerator. I have never seen anyone try this before and was shocked and surprised and astounded to see it.'

Oncoming driver Ashley Shaw managed to avoid a head-on collision as Myatt crashed off the road and smashed into a tree.

Joanne Wallbanks, defending, told the court: 'This was out of character. It resulted in the death of his friend.

'His biggest punishment is having it on his conscience for the rest of his life.'

Myatt was also banned from driving for five years.

The family of Mr Fairlie, from Weston Coyney, Staffs., paid tribute to their 'treasured son' after the case.

Devastated mum Gillian said: ''To say we are devastated and heartbroken is an understatement.

'We will never be a happy family again. We have lost a treasured son and Lee has lost his only brother.'

Sergeant Ian Tanner, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'We hope the sentence brings some closure for Scott's family and friends, who have endured an extremely difficult 12 months.

'Myatt was responsible for the death of a young man whose life has been cut tragically short.'It is vital that all motorists follow the rules of the road.'
