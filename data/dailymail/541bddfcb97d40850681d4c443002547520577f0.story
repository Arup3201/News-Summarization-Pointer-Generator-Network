West Ham striker Diafra Sakho faces a ban after the Senegalese FA lodged an official complaint with FIFA.

Senegal coach Alain Giresse blasted the 25-year-old on Monday night after he featured for his club side against Bristol City 24 hours earlier, despite pulling out of the Africa Cup of Nations with a back injury.

Sakho climbed off the bench to bag the winner in the FA Cup fourth round clash against the League One side, but Senegal officials were not expecting him to play.

However, Senegalese FA chiefs have spoken to FIFA and demanded they take action, which could mean the summer signing from Metz could be banned by world football's governing body.

The tournament in Equatorial Guinea runs until February 8, and although Senegal have already crashed out, FIFA can stop Sakho appearing for the Hammers for the duration of the competition.

That means he could miss the Premier League games against Liverpool and Manchester United, while they could issue a fine or an even longer ban.

Senegalese fans also want the Hammers booted out of the FA Cup. Sam Allardyce's side travel to West Brom in the fifth round next month.

Senegal coach Alain Giresse revealed he was very surprised to learn Sakho had played against Bristol City

Giresse said earlier this week: ‘I’m very surprised to learn that he played. When you cannot fly for six weeks and then suddenly you’re playing a football game. There must be miraculous medicine in England.

‘This sets a dangerous precedent because in future you are going to have players claiming they cannot catch planes to Africa but who can still play football (for their clubs). It is a debate that deserves more discussion.’
