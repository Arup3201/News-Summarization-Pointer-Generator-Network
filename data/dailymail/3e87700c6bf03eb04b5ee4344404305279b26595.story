One in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found (picture posed by model)

It is known as the most important meal of the day.

But one in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found.

This can leave them tired and moody and lower the quality of their work, oat producer Flahavan's said.

While two in three people are eating breakfast every day, the study found one in 13 never had a morning meal.

Of those who are regularly missing out, two-thirds said they found it difficult to eat early in the morning, with other reasons including not considering breakfast important, not having time, preferring to stay in bed and having too many chores.

The results showed more people were regularly missing the first meal of the day, compared with the 20 per cent who were skipping it three years ago.

The time taken to eat the meal is also lower, now at just over nine minutes compared to almost ten in 2012. 

What the nation is eating for breakfast appears to be constantly changing, too. 

While cold cereals, porridge, fruit and toast remain the staple morning fuel for the majority of breakfasters, the fry up has now become an occasional treat with only 1.5 per cent of respondents saying they started the day with a traditional breakfast most days of the week. 

John Noonan, of Flahavan's, said: 'Our findings show a shift in the number of people having breakfast - the eating occasion renowned for being the most important meal of the day.

Just 1.5 per cent of people have a traditional fried breakfast before work every morning, a study found

'It's no secret that we all need a good breakfast to get the day off to a good start. 

'And while it's great to see that people are becoming more health-conscious with their breakfast choices - opting for porridge and healthy cereals - the number of people who are regularly going without breakfast is certainly surprising, particularly given that making a nutritious, tasty breakfast takes no time at all.

'We know that people are time-pressured, particularly from Monday to Friday, but skipping breakfast only results in people feeling worse in the long-run, as they don't have enough energy to power them through the day.'
