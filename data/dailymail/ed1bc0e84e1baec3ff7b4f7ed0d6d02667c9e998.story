Posing for a Balmain campaign with Cara Delevingne, boogying at Wireless with Nicole Scherzinger and modelling for Next's sister label - just a week in the world of supermodel Jourdan Dunn.

The hard-working, jet-setting supermodel, and doting mother to her four-year-old son, has managed to squeeze in yet another fashion shoot, this time for Label - a website full of designer brands.

The 23-year-old catwalk queen looks effortlessly cool and chic as she models feminine summer dresses, fitted snakeskin pencil skirts and casual sportsluxe-inspired looks.

Does this girl ever sleep? Fresh from her glitzy Balmain campaign and a weekend of partying at Wireless festival, Jourdan Dunn has been unveiled as the face of Label

Label called on Jourdan to help showcase the new additions to its website, which includes clothes from Coast, Carvela, Steve Madden, and Bertie, in addition to existing brands including Hobbs, LK Bennett, Warehouse, Oasis, Nike and Lipsy.

Earlier 
this year, the six 
foot clothes horse was unveiled as the new face of Maybelline New York, 
where she joins an elite group of models, including Christy 
Turlington, Adriana Lima, Erin Wasson, Emily DiDonato and Mollie King.

As
 a British Vogue regular, who has worked for the likes of DKNY and 
Burberry, Jourdan was on the road to success very early in her career.

Speaking at the Vogue 
Festival recently, Jourdan opened up about her insecurities growing 
up: 'I was very tall and lanky and I wasn't really feeling myself when I
 was growing up at all.

'Especially because, coming from a 
Caribbean background, curves are celebrated and me being really tall and
skinny wouldn't [be]. So I was like... didn't want to go out or be seen
or anything.'

Talents: In addition to being a model mother and philanthropist, Jourdan is a self-taught cook and hosts a lifestyle and cooking program titled 'Well Dunn with Jourdan Dunn'

Best friends: Speaking at the Vogue Festival, Jourdan, pictured with close friend and fellow model Cara 
Delevingne, opened up about her insecurities growing up

She even admitted to running up 
'crazy' phone bills when she first moved to New York for work aged 16, 
because she missed her family so much: 'Every minute I was on the phone 
to my mum crying, complaining, more crying and more complaining.'

When she is not modeling, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. 

This has led to Jourdan’s active involvement as the Parent Ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.

In addition to being a mother and philanthropist, Jourdan is a 
self-taught cook and hosts a lifestyle and cooking program titled 'Well 
Dunn with Jourdan Dunn.'

Stellar career: Jourdan was first discovered by a
 model scout while out with friends and has since walked for Topshop
