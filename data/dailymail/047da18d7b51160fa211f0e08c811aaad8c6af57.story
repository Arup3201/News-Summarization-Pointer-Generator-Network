Holidaymakers can now follow in the footsteps of the cast of Modern Family at a newly opened luxury resort on the One&Only Hayman Island, in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef.

The award-winning American TV series filmed its 'Australia family holiday' episode on the island after a £44m transformation at the resort, which opened this week.

Members of the cast and crew of Modern Family, including actors Sofia Vergara, Ed O'Neill, Julie Bowen and Ty Burrell stayed on the island  ahead of its official opening on July 1.

The filming in Australia was 
followed by days of intense media speculation as to the movements and 
itineraries of the cast and plans for the show.

One&Only Hayman Island, surrounded by a natural ecosystem of pristine coral reef formations and diverse marine life, is now welcoming guests, and Australian tourism chiefs say the link with Modern Family will significantly boost visitor numbers to the iconic location.

The revamped resort boasts a new pool wing and restaurants, however the number of suites at the resort has been reduced from 209 to 160.

The suites range from £400 a night, to the £5,500 a night 'Three Bedroom Owners Penthouse', which can fit six people and includes three bathrooms, a kitchenette, bar, wrap around balcony and an on-call butler.

The 
reopening of the resort coincided with the return of direct Qantas 
flights from Sydney to the Whitsunday Islands after a ten-year hiatus, 
signalling renewed confidence for tourism to the cyclone and 
dollar-battered region.

Qantas
 says the reinstated flights could bring an extra 10,000 visitors to the
 islands each year, and boost the number of American visitors as well as
 local holidaymakers.

Queensland Parliament Member for Whitsunday Jason Costigan says the Queensland government has ambitions of doubling overnight visitor numbers across the state by 2020.

A new pool wing and restaurants have been built in the One&Only resort, and the number of suites has been reduced from 209 to 160. 

Talk about personalised service: Qantas even renamed the plane flying in the cast the Modern Family Flyer

Suites 
range from a $735 (£400) a night one-bedroom option to the 'Three 
Bedroom Owners Penthouse', which comes in at about $10,000 (£5,500) a 
night.

The
 Penthouse can accommodate six people and includes three bathrooms, a 
kitchenette, bar, wrap around balcony - and an on-call butler.

Hayman
 Island is owned by Malaysian conglomerate Mulpha and managed by Kerzner
 International, whose One&Only portfolio also includes hotels in 
Mexico, the Bahamas and Dubai. 

The resort's accommodation options have 
been 're-imagined' and guests will be treated to innovative culinary 
options, a KidsOnly programme and the One&Only Spa, all with 
signature service throughout, say its owners.

A Qantas A380 renamed the 'Modern Family Flyer' touched down at Sydney International Airport in February with the celebrity cast, the majority of whom were visiting Australia for the first time.

Filming took place across a range of iconic locations including the One&Only Hayman Island Resort in Queensland.

The cast of Modern Family tweeted pictures of themselves filming in the location, and Instagram pictures of the actors enjoying themselves in Australia have boosted tourism, the resort's owners say.

As for the cast, perhaps unsurprisingly they had only good things to say about the place.

'We're grateful to the folks from One&Only for their hospitality on Hayman Island,' said Steve Levitan, co-creator, and executive producer of Modern Family. 

'After our hectic shoot in Sydney, it was perfect to wrap things up at such an exotic, beautiful and private place.  It was an experience we will always remember.'
