Mobbed: La Guarida restaurant provided this handout photo of Beyonce's visit that quickly became mobbed

All eyes: Jay-Z appeared to stare protectively of his wife who carefully stepped behind him in heels as they walked into the flash of waiting cameras

Beaming beauty: Beyonce otherwise beamed and smiled for the cameras and her fans while described by a waitress to have not been wearing a drop of makeup

The famous couple's bodyguards' presence outside set
the gritty, bustling neighbourhood of Centre Havana abuzz, and a crowd 
gathered downstairs shouting Beyonce's name until she went to a balcony 
and waved.

Waitress
Silvia Fernandez said Beyonce toured the eatery and looked at photos of
past celebrity clients including Jack Nicholson, Jodie Foster, Danny Glover, 
Will Smith and James Belushi.

'She
was beautiful, without a drop of makeup, very natural,' Fernandez said. 'What happened with the people was incredible.'

She
was wearing a patterned yellow ensemble which showed off her legs while
rapper Jay-Z, 43, looked like the quintessential tourist in shorts, a 
blue T-shirt and hat.

La Guarida staffers showed The

favourites - fish, chicken, black beans and rice - accompanied by their 
mothers.

The privately run restaurant is famous
as the filming location for the hit movie Strawberry and Chocolate, and
is a mainstay on Havana's tourist circuit.

The couple - who married Paris on April 4, 2008 - toured colonial
Old Havana wearing dark glasses and were surrounded by bodyguards and 
excited fans.

Beyonce and

travelled to Cuba. State-run website CubaSi called it a tourist trip.

Washington's
51-year embargo makes it illegal for U.S. citizens to visit Cuba for 
mere tourism, although tens of thousands of Americans travel there each 
year on academic, religious, journalistic or cultural exchange visas.

The Obama administration eased many 
of the restrictions in 2011, but tourists still need a special visa or 
to be part of an organized tour.

In the past, artists who were challenged by the government have said 
they visited for cultural purposes.
