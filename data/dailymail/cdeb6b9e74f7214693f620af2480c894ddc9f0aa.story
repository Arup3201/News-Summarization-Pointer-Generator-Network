Military charities have hit out at the 'horrible' traders who are re-selling exclusive crystal-encrusted poppies for up to seven times their original price - and refusing to donate any of the proceeds to charity.

The poppies, which have soared in popularity since stars Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos wore them on Sunday’s X Factor, can be bought from the Royal British Legion for £20.

They are from jeweller Buckley’s and all profits go to the charity, which helps former service personnel and their families.

Yesterday the official Legion eBay 
store had sold out of the limited edition badges but last night there 
were at least 20 poppies for sale on the site, the paper said, with only
a handful pledging to donate the cash to charity, the paper said.

A spokeseron for the Royal British Legion said: 'We work closely with eBay and have for the second year running launched an eBay shop selling official poppy products from The Royal British Legion.

'We encourage all members of the public to buy their poppy items directly from our store.

'To date, eBay users have raised over £500,000 in support of The Royal British Legion’s vital work caring for our Armed Forces, past and present, and their families by either buying products directly from our eBay store, or from generous donations at the checkout when they buy or sell other items.

'We strongly encourage anyone 
re-selling poppy items to donate to the Legion and urge buyers on eBay 
to look for the 'eBay for Charity' ribbon which identifies listings 
where a percentage of the sale will be donated to charity.'

Gulf war veteran Steve ­Valentine, 42, co-founder of Army Of Angels which supports wounded troops, told The Star: 'Unfortunately there are some people who use charities like this to line their own pockets.

'It’s horrible. They are making money from something that should be going to our veterans.'

As well as the X Factor, contestants and judges on Strictly Come Dancing wore the badge, as TV stars on Loose Women, Saturday Kitchen and Alan Carr: Chatty Man.
