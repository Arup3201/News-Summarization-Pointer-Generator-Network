German couple Emanuele Zaubert and Walter Ledermuller are mighty proud of their pooch Junior, the harmonising French bulldog.

The Cologne duo have posted a series of videos featuring Junior, with the most popular proving to be the pup's pop star turn.

In this clip, Junior joins Emanuele as he sings along to American pop group A Great Big World's hit song Say Something.

Simon Cowell telling the pair they 'nailed it' might be a stretch, but they're certainly having a good time in the car with the top down. And Junior is having no problem with the high notes.

Emanuele and Walter have even created a website and a Facebook account for Junior to keep his fans updated.

And they offer fans a chance to meet the canine star in the flesh, if they book their apartment in Germany for their holidays.

Walter Ledermuller posted the video on YouTube as the pair sing in harmony to A Great Big World's hit

'You want to meet Junior in real life?' they say on the website. 

'Come to Cologne and book our apartment.

'Junior is curious to welcome new guests. He is waiting at the door and he will greet you first (before we have the chance to say hallo)'. [sic]
