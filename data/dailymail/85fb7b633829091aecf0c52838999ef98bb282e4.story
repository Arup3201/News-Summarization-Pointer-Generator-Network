This is the incredible haul of luxury goods amassed by a secretary who stole £320,000 from her boss - including 32 pairs of designer shoes and Tiffany jewellery.

Helen Hart, 46, from Illogan, Cornwall, blew the cash on a champagne lifestyle including expensive cars, diamonds and £8,000 hotel stays.

She told her boss she had inherited the fortune from a gangland uncle who was friends with the Kray Twins.

More than 30 pairs of shoes will form part of an online auction of designer items seized from fraudster Helen Hart

Gucci jewellery will start at just £1 in the auction which will take place on Monday

Brands of shoes include those from designers Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Russell and Bromley

But in reality she was milking the 
accounts at Cornish engineering firm PDP Green Consulting and left the 
company facing an unpaid £271,000 tax bill in May 2011.

Police spent the next year unravelling the trail of missing money before charging Hart with multiple counts of fraud, theft and deception.

Helen Hart was jailed for four years for stealing £320,000 from the company where she worked

She
was jailed for four years earlier this month at Truro Crown Court after
previously admitting 25 separate charges spanning October 2005 to May 
2012.

Now Devon and Cornwall Police are selling off items confiscated from Hart after her arrest.

They include 32 pairs of designer shoes from Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Russell and Bromley, as well as lavish jewellery from the likes of Gucci, Harrods and Tiffany & Co.

Many of the 71 items, which all have a starting price of £1, will be sold for a fraction of their high street price before the auction on the Bumblebee Auctions website finishes on Monday.

A spokesman from Devon and Cornwall Police’s financial investigation unit at Truro said: 'Confiscation of assets is part of the sentencing process. Helen Hart lived an affluent lifestyle which included buying expensive items for her personal use.

'She should not be allowed to benefit from the proceeds of her crimes and this process helps that be the case. We work hard to ensure that the proceeds of crime are taken from criminals.

'Legislation means in certain cases we can go back six years to calculate what a person has earned from their illegal lifestyle.'

Hart’s lavish spending included £5,990 for a return trip to Paris, £7,816 on a hotel stay in Devon and £4,752 on tickets and hospitality for a Premier League football match.

She also spent £31,368 on renovation work at her home and £46,500 on a Mercedes along with buying a Porsche Boxster, Range Rover and a BMW X5.

Hart bought jewellery from high-end retailers such as Gucci, Harrords and Tiffany & Co.

A further £2,000 was spent on a kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of fine wine and other sums frittered away on designer shopping sprees.

She blew much of the money on seducing toyboy lovers including student Adam Cope, 20, whom she promised to buy a Lamborghini before being caught.

Devon and Cornwall Police’s financial investigation unit has confiscated more than £350,000 since April last year.

The spokesman added: 'We are proud that the confiscation amount either goes to the victim or, if there is no victim, then a proportion of the confiscation money goes back into the local community. We strive to ensure that crime does not pay.'
