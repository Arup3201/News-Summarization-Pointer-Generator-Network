A witness in the case of a four-year-old boy who was allegedly starved to death described going to give him a hug but daring not squeeze him too much in case his bones broke.

The witness, who cannot be named, told the jury at Bradford Crown Court how Hamza Khan was beneath an upturned drawer covered in blankets.

'I knew it was Hamzah because he was skinny and his baby suit,' the witness said and, describing how she had bent down to give the emaciated boy a hug, added: 'I didn't squeeze him so I wouldn't break his bones.

'He was that thin.'

Tragic: Police found the body of four-year-old 
Hamzah Khan in his mother's bedroom two years after his death. A witness 
today told how before he died she didn't dare to hug him too tightly 
because he was so thin

Hamza's mother Amanda Hutton, 43, from Bradford, is on trial accused of her son's manslaughter after police found the boy in a mummified state in her bedroom almost two years after his death.

The witness, who was present at the house but cannot be identified, today described to the jury how Hamzah looked 'absolutely appalling' shortly before he died on December 15, 2009.

'He looked all crusty and pale,' the witness said. 'He looked really skinny, stick thin. He didn’t get fed much.'

The witness said Hamzah only got one meal a day and had difficulty walking.

The jury has heard how Hamza’s body was found by police in September 2011 in cot in his mother’s bedroom at their home in Bradford.

He had died 21 months before he was found, Bradford Crown Court was told. Prosecutors allege the little boy was severely malnourished and had starved to death.

Hutton, who denies manslaughter, is expected to argue Hamzah died of natural causes, the jury has been told.

'She had a lot of alcohol': Hutton, of Bradford, who denies manslaughter, is expected to argue Hamzah died of natural causes, the jury has been told

The witness described Hutton’s house 
being filled with mouldy rubbish and faeces, saying: 'There were lots of bins 
bags. Lots of mould and wee and cat food.'

Asked what was in the bin bags, the witness said: 'Empty bottles, crisp packets, snotty tissues and lots and lots of cans.'

The witness went on to describe the bathroom in the terraced house. The court heard that the bath was full of cat faeces and also had vomit in it which had gone mouldy.

Hutton vomited regularly, the witness told the court, and could not walk properly because of her alcohol consumption.

'She (Hutton) had a lot of alcohol and she had three bottles a day,' the witness said. 'And she smoked a lot. It was vodka, Smirnoff and something. Usually from the Co-op.

'She drank more vodka than water.'

The witness added: 'She was always being sick.'

Asked whether the tap worked in the bathroom sink, the witness said: 'Green stuff came out of it.'

The witness told the jury that laundry did not get done. She (Hutton) couldn’t walk properly and she couldn’t be bothered either.

'They were just in the kitchen in bags. She said he was going to do it but she never did.'

The witness described how Hutton would tell Hamzah to 'hurry up, you silly b******' and saw Hutton hit the little boy.

The witness did not know what happened to Hamzah after December 15, 2009. 'But I saw something brown in the cot,' the witness said. 'It may have been Hamzah.'

Later, Hutton's brother, Michael, told the court his sister had been a cannabis user since the late Eighties. But he said her heavy drinking started much later.

Mr Hutton said his sister was 'knocked about' by her husband, Aftab Khan. He said he would visit her and find her with 'less and less teeth'.

Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, told the court Hutton's house in 2011 was 'an absolute pig-sty, filled with rubbish - disgusting, the state of it'.

Mr Meadowcroft asked Mr Hutton if he was turned away from that house in 2011 and he agreed that he was.

The barrister asked Mr Hutton about the state of house when he visited in 2009.

He replied: 'Perfectly decent, ordinary.'

Hutton's other brother Christopher said, in a statement read to the court, that his sister had been a heavy cannabis user for as long as he could remember.

The case continues.
