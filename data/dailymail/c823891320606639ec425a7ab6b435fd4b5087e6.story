John Moore-Robinson, who died just 24 hours after being discharged from the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital in April 2006

The father of a 20-year-old cyclist who bled to death after being misdiagnosed with bruised ribs when he actually had a ruptured spleen has said he will never forgive the hospital for the grave mistake.

John Moore-Robinson was discharged from scandal-hit Stafford Hospital despite being unable to walk, and later died after suffering a heart attack in his home.

After an eight-year battle for justice by Mr Moore-Robinson's family, a coroner ruled today that the young man's death could have been prevented if hospital staff had provided 'appropriate' care.  

Mr Moore-Robinson, from Sileby, Leicestershire, collapsed and died in April 2006 within hours of being sent home in a wheelchair with an undiagnosed ruptured spleen

A second inquest into his death was told that staff at Stafford Hospital were told that the 20-year-old's condition was potentially life-threatening.

But the telecoms engineer, who had been hurt in a cycling accident, was discharged later the same day after X-rays showed he had no broken bones, despite friends saying he was confused and vomiting.

A string of serious failings in care 'more than minimally' contributed to Mr Moore-Robinson's death, Coroner Catherine Mason said.

Mrs Mason, recording a narrative verdict, said: 'The seriousness of Mr Moore-Robinson's condition was not fully appreciated and decisions in relation to his care were made on incomplete information as a result of poor communication, poor documentation, inadequate assessment, insufficient investigation and an oversight to consider medical notes that were available.

'If Mr Moore-Robinson had been managed in accordance with his needs, the clinical grounds necessitating his admission to hospital would have been apparent.

'The opportunity to provide appropriate care to treat his ruptured spleen and prevent critical collapse of the venous system would not have been lost and on the balance of probabilities the loss of his life could have been prevented.'

Mrs Mason added that a 'continuous sequence of shortcomings' had created a chain of events leading to the cyclist being discharged early.  

Mr Moore-Robinson, whose friends had to use a wheelchair to take him to a waiting car, later called an ambulance himself from his home but suffered a heart attack shortly after paramedics arrived.

Medics at Leicester Royal Infirmary attempted to revive him but he was pronounced dead at 2.35am on April 2, 2006.

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Moore-Robinson's father, Frank, said: 'Stafford Hospital at the time was in melt-down.

'Many, many people have lost their lives, including our son John, and that we can never forgive them for. It's been a hard road but one we have had to take.'

Kelly Hainsworth, Mr Moore-Robinson's sister, said: 'The last eight years have not been about publicity, headlines or notoriety - it has been about finding the truth.

'It has been a long eight years but we have had to walk this path together to get justice and to make the NHS a safer place for everybody.

'We are satisfied with the facts that have been laid before the coroner and accept the findings.'

Relatives also thanked the coroner for her 'fearless' inquiry into the care provided at Stafford Hospital, which was the subject of a government inquiry in 2010.

The 20-year-old telecoms engineer was discharged from Stafford Hospital because X-rays showed he had no broken bones, despite friends saying he was confused and vomiting

In 2009, it emerged that hundreds of patients could have died unnecessarily because of shocking levels of care in the Stafford Hospital's A&E department

An inquest held in 2007 into Mr Moore-Robinson's death also recorded a narrative verdict but Mr Moore-Robinson's parents campaigned for a fresh hearing after new evidence came to light.

Concluding the second inquest, Mrs Mason found that Mr Moore-Robinson was not triaged properly, and that a nurse had failed to communicate 'obvious' and relevant information to a doctor.

As a result of the failure, the patient was seen by a junior doctor more than an hour after his arrival at Stafford Hospital.

Routine procedures were also carried out inadequately, the new inquest heard. 

A nurse told the hearing that staff at Stafford felt 'bullied' by a four-hour target for patients' length of stay in the accident and emergency department.

Commenting on the situation at the hospital in 2006, Mrs Mason added: 'Although I was pleased to hear in evidence that the staffing levels have now much improved ... I find as of fact that on 1st April 2006 there was a failure to adequately staff the accident and emergency department which impacted on the adequacy of care.'
