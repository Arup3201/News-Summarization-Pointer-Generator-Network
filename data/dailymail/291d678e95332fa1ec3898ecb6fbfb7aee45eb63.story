A facial palsy sufferer who spent years hiding indoors and undergoing painful surgery has found love and married.

Carly Bailey, 33, from Sheffield, was diagnosed with the condition, which causes a weakness of the facial muscles and paralysis, when she was 14 years old.

The mother-of-two felt she was ‘too ugly’ to find love and hardly ever went outside after suffering years of torment.

Mrs Bailey was diagnosed with facial palsy when she was 14 and had to pluck up the courage to ask out now husband Scott, right 

But after plucking up the courage, she asked out her now husband Scott for a drink and their relationship blossomed.

Now they are married, with Mrs Bailey saying he is helped her to transform her life.

She explained: 'I never thought I’d find love, I had given up hope on finding my Mr Perfect.

'I’ve spent the last twenty years hiding my face and after a few unsuccessful facial surgeries, I was left feeling ugly and alone.

Mrs Bailey has credited her husband Scott with helping to transform her life and building her confidence 

The couple were married last month in a ceremony at Sheffield Town Hall, despite Mrs Bailey spending years hiding indoors 

'I had known Scott for about seven years but I had never plucked up the confidence to tell him how I felt about him.

'I was terrified he’d reject me because of the way I looked. I didn’t think for a second that he’d actually fancy me too.

'I’ve been living on cloud nine ever since I met Scott, it was the happiest day of my life when we got married.

'He has completely transformed my life and I finally feel comfortable in my own skin.'

The couple tied the knot last month in a ceremony at Sheffield Town Hall.

She added: 'I had never been in love before I met Scott.

Since her diagnosis, the 33-year-old has undergone 16 operations to try and correct her face leaving her with scars, right 

'But he was worth the wait as we are perfect for each other.'

Mrs Bailey had been bullied throughout school for her facial palsy, something that had dented her confidence for more than 18 years.

Doctors first thought she was suffering from Bell’s Palsy, a temporary facial paralysis that would last about six weeks.

But three months later, she was sent for an MRI scan, after there was no improvement.

This revealed she was suffering from cholesteatoma, a serious infection of the ear.

In Mrs Bailey's case the disease was attacking the bones in her ear something that led to facial palsy.

She was left feeling too frightened to leave the house and only ventured outdoors to go to work.

She added: 'Since my diagnosis I have undergone 16 operations to try and correct some of the muscles in my face but all of them failed to improve my self-esteem.

'It wasn’t until talking to the charity Changing Faces that I started to accept my appearance.

Facial palsy is caused by a weakness of the facial muscles due to either temporary or permanent damage to nerves in the face.

When the nerves are damaged they are unable to receive the necessary messages in order to function properly, which results in paralysis in the affected part of the face.

Nerve damage can be caused by viral infections such as Bell's palsy or bacterial infections affecting the ear.

Other causes are surgery, traumatic injuries and stroke.

It can affect one part or all of the face and can also affect tears, saliva production and taste. 

'This new confidence gave me the push I needed to approach Scott and tell him how I felt.

'I can’t thank the charity enough, they have transformed my life.

'I couldn't be happier with how things have turned out, I feel as though as my dreams have come true.'

The couple who both have children from previous relationships, can’t wait to start their new lives together.

Scott has three children, Harvey, three, Nikki, 14 and Josh 15 and Carly has two, Madalyn, 11 and Ashton, six.

Dr James Partridge OBE, chief executive of Changing Faces said: 'We are so proud that our work has helped Carly so much.

'She is a truly amazing, inspirational woman, and her determination just goes to show that with the right help and support, having an unusual appearance shouldn't be a barrier to success.

'We have a fantastic team in Sheffield, helping people right across Yorkshire and The Humber, and we hope that Carly’s story will encourage other people to come to us and get support. We wish Carly and Scott every happiness in their life together.'
