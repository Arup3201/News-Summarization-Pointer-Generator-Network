The optimum amount is 3-4mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight one hour prior to exercise

Many of us rely on our morning cup of coffee to help us feel more alert, but new research says it can actually help us perform better in the gym, too.

The caffeine in coffee makes exercise feel easier, improves attention and reduces symptoms of fatigue - and a cup at the right time can help us to exercise harder and for longer.

Studies show the optimum amount is 3-4mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight one hour prior to exercise.

An average mug of instant coffee contains approximately 100mg of caffeine. So for someone who weighs 61kg who wants to consume 3.5mgs of caffeine, that would equal 213.5mgs - or just over two average mugs.

This amount of caffeine enables gym bunnies to
 perform for 30 per cent longer, while improving alertness and the 
ability to sustain motor skills and helping persistence, vigour and 
output levels according to a new report from the British Coffee Association.

Studies have shown how caffeine improves
 endurance and performance in cycling high intensity running, repeated 
sprinting and sports such as football and rugby; and some athletes have 
said they consume caffeine to enhance their endurance, alertness and 
motor skills.

These benefits result from the actions of caffeine in the brain where it reduces the chemical messages that normally induce fatigue and stimulates energy production and fat oxidation.

However nutrition experts warn of the associated dangers of continued reliance of caffeine for sports.

'Coffee is a proven performance enhancer and weightloss aid, but we do need to be careful'

'The short term effects of caffeine on fatigue, endurance and performance are well established and for many drinking large volumes of coffee and caffeine energy drinks this is the norm,' says Dr Gill Hart, Clinical Biochemist, YorkTest Laboratories (yorktest.com).

'However, there are many negative 
effects of caffeine including insomnia, anxiety, headaches, palpitations
 and high blood pressure that also come into play.

'High caffeine consumption can also 
cause high levels of homocysteine in the blood, raised levels of which 
are associated with strokes, heart-attacks, dementia and infertility – 
it’s important to not only think about the quick fix but the longer term
 on your health too.'

Independent
 personal trainer Jack Braniff from urbanenergiefitness.com has written 
at length about the pros and cons of drinking coffee for fitness on his 
website, highlighting many fo Dr Hart's concerns.

However he says it's still worth drinking.

'Coffee is a
 proven ergogenic (performance enhancer) and weightloss aid, but we do 
need to be a little careful. One must exercise prudence when 
incorporating coffee into the diet.

'Too
 much caffeine causes stress on your adrenal system which can lead to 
poor sleep and increased cortisol levels (stress) - and ultimately 
weight gain.

'Some people tolerate caffeine better than others, so that's why everyone needs to be careful about how much they're having.

'The recommended daily dose for an average person is 400mg, which equates to around 4 cups of coffee each day; obviously this is dependent on what coffee we're drinking. If we keep within this bracket, we should not experience the associated negative side effects.

'I would recommend drinking coffee for three particular purposes including pre-workout to maximize performance, in the morning to help you wake up, and for general weight loss.'

Around 70 
million cups consumed every day in the UK, and contrary to popular 
belief exercise lovers who drink it do not necessarily need to 
compensate by increasing their intake of water.      

Recent
 research found any diuretic effect of caffeine in a normal cup of 
coffee is more than balanced by the amount of water in the drink - 
leading to hydration.

Recent research from BRITA reveals that 51 per cent of us drink caffeinated drinks during the day, with 55 per cent drinking 3 or more cups of coffee per day. Nutritionist Jo Travers comments:

'Caffeine is scientifically proven to help you when exercising, however it's an unpredictable substance. When drinking coffee you can't be sure on the amount of caffeine you are ingesting. It's important to stay hydrated with water as it improves performance and helps keep the body running at an optimum temperature. Staying hydrated will also improve your concentration levels, allowing you to get more out of your workout.'

The research from BRITA also revealed that 62 per cent of us only drink water when we are really thirsty.

'Getting thirsty is actually one of the very last physical effects dehydration has on the body so the damage may have already begun,' says Jo.

Key insights on coffee and making exercise feel easier

•   
 Drink coffee one hour before morning or lunchtime exercise. If you want
 to exercise in the afternoon or evening, enjoy a coffee with your lunch
 to avoid the effect of the lunchtime dip

•    For competitive 
sports, consuming coffee improves attention to detail, observance of 
your surroundings, and reduces symptoms of fatigue through caffeine's 
effect on the central nervous system3

•    Hydration is important 
for endurance exercise performance. Coffee, when consumed in moderation 
(four to five cups of coffee or 400mg of caffeine per day), provides 
similar hydrating qualities to water and does not cause dehydration

Mike 
Gleeson, exercise biochemistry professor at Loughborough 
University, says: 'Studies show that if you consume enough caffeine at 
the right time, it can enhance your physical performance.

'New
 research shows black instant coffee consumed one hour prior to exercise
 can improve endurance performance in a similar way to pure caffeine (of
 equivalent amounts), which suggests coffee may be a very effective way 
to consume caffeine before exercise.' 

'Studies
 have found caffeine consumption has a greater effect on physical 
performance in those who are recreationally active than in trained 
athletes, and can improve cycling, running, and high-intensity sports 
such as football and rugby over a 80-90 minute period.'

For pregnant women the NHS recommends consuming no more than 200mg of caffeine per day from all sources.
