Under-fire John Bercow was today accused of behaving like royalty after enjoying more than £11,000 of hospitality at top flight sporting events.

The Commons Speaker was wined and dined at a dozen tennis and football matches, including seats in the Royal Box at Wimbledon.

He insists he is ‘representing the Commons’ at the Queen’s Club, Everton and West Ham but critics said he should concentrate on the day job.

In June this year John Bercow enjoyed seats at Wimbledon with Philip Brook, chairman of the All England club

Pressure is mounting on Mr Bercow, amid claims his impartiaility make him unsuitable for the job.

Respected outgoing Commons clerk Sir Robert Rogers used his parting shot to warn Mr Bercow he had to be fair to all political parties.

And an anonymous Commons motion has been circulated in Parliament demanding he quit after failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors.

This week he has face criticism for handing a parliamentary pass to wealthy businesswoman and Labour donor Farah Sassoon, a friend of his wife Sally who has since donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’s bid for re-election.

The money was logged in his register of interests alongside an enviable list of sporting events he has enjoyed in the last year – free of charge.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant said the trips to sporting events suggested Mr Bercow considers himself to be  'either a member of Government or the Royal Family'

It includes watching Roger Federer lose to Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final this year, sitting in the Royal Box just feet from William and Kate.

The freebie was worth £4,315 and followed a £1,895 day out to SW19 barely a week earlier.

It was also a step up from Centre Court worth £148 paid for by the Lawn Tennis Association at last year’s Wimbledon championships

Last year he also had a week’s pass to the ATP World Tour in November worth £1,000 and Barclays paid for two tickets worth £200.

There have also been two tickets to West Ham football club, two tickets to Everton and two tickets for a match supplied by the FA.

A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: ‘Britain is a great sporting nation; the Speaker, who in accordance with the rules declares the cost of any ticket of sporting events he is invited to, is a big sports fan. 

'It is no secret that he is an enthusiast of football and tennis; he is an Arsenal season ticket holder - as is his eldest son - and was a junior tennis champion. 

'He regards it as part of his role in representing the House of Commons to support British sports and is honoured to have been invited to events such as Wimbledon.

'In accordance with the rules. He declares the cost of any ticket. 

Tory Michael Fabricant told MailOnline: ‘John Bercow clearly believes his role transcends that of merely being Speaker.

‘He clearly now considers himself a representative of the State: either as a member of Government or the Royal Family.

‘Neither of which he is. This is an interesting innovation. Personally, I'd rather he adopted the new role, for him, of being an impartial Speaker.’

Mr Bercow is a self-declared tennis nut, and has written a book called Tennis Maestros on his favourite 20 male players of all time.

His register of interests includes £2,000 in expenses from publisher BiteBack towards writing the tome.

Criticism of the Speaker has mounted in recent weeks, after he has appeared to repeatedly mock David Cameron in the Commons and faced accusations of being rude to staff.

One of the most bizarre exchanges came as Mr Cameron took questions during a lengthy sessions on Gaza and the Malaysian Airlines MH17 atrocity.

Farah Sassoon, who is a friend and drinking partner of Sally Bercow (pictured together above after an awards ceremony last year), has donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’ s 2015 campaign in his Buckingham seat

Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘Somebody asked how long the statement would run, but I would just point out, if I may, that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the Prime Minister’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough, I am sure.’ 

This week he has faced calls for an official inquiry over why he gave a parliamentary pass to Mrs Sassoon - allowing full unescorted access to the Palace of Westminster – two years ago.

She is a friend and drinking partner of Mr Berow’s wife, Sally, and was pictured cavorting in the back of a taxi with Mrs Bercow last year.
