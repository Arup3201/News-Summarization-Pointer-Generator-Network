Family and friends have paid tribute to the young father who died on Christmas Eve after his legs were severed by a train last month.

Adrian Simon, 18, was celebrating his birthday with friends when he fell asleep on the tracks at a railway crossing near Taree, on the north coast of New South Wales, on December 21. 

The teenager was struck by a train around 4:30am and died at John Hunter Hospital three days later.

Devastated friends and family took to social media to post written and picture tributes to the 18-year-old, known to many as 'Bud'.

Train tracks: This is the crossing where the tragic incident occurred, costing the 18-year-old his life

Emergency services were called to Bushland Drive railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast

Perhaps most tragically, his Facebook profile is filled with pictures of him cuddling a baby girl, with a collage featuring the caption: 'Daddy's lil gurl'.  

A devastated relative wrote on Facebook: 'It warms my heart knowing a piece of you has been left with us through your babies.'

'(And) to know they have an angel called Dad to watch over them (and) guide them throughout their journey of life'. 

An angry group of people, which police said included Mr Simon's father, attacked emergency services workers who arrived at the morbid scene to try and save his life.

Paramedics who were first to the scene to try and revive the injured teen were pushed, verbally abused and blocked. 

Members of the crowd hurled rocks at the ambulance and police said the father smashed the vehicle's windscreen.  

The crowd also hurled rocks at the train driver and the first police officers on the scene, who were forced to take cover inside the driver's cabin and call for reinforcements.

Emergency services found the man on the tracks with his legs severed, at about 4.30am on December 21. He was taken to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a serious condition

Detectives believe the teenager was celebrating his 18th birthday with family and friends at a home near the railway line before he was struck by the train.  

The train driver, a 33-year-old Queensland man, managed to stop the train after the accident and call emergency services. He underwent mandatory drug and alcohol testing.  

Taree Inspector Allan Fidock told a Sydney newspaper Mr Simon's father had apologised for his actions.

'Today the father has been better to us and is apologetic for his actions,' he told the Daily Telegraph.  

'It is horrific to have to deal with that and then deal with alcohol-induced friends and family. And they are having a go at the cops and ambulance officers. 

Police reinforcements managed to disperse the troublemakers. A police source told Daily Mail Australia investigations into the accident are continuing. 

Bystanders caused havoc for emergency services by throwing rocks at police investigating the scene and abusing paramedics during their initial attempts to treat the teen
