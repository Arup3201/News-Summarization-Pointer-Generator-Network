This is the moment a distraught animal sanctuary owner collapsed in the mud after bailiffs arrived to evict her from her farm.

Paula Campbell, who has cared for thousands of abandoned pets over the past 20 years, was so overcome with grief she required hospital treatment.

Following years of court cases and appeals, bailiffs arrived to take possession of the sanctuary due to thousands of pounds owed in mortgage arrears.

Collapse: Paula Campbell (on the ground), 47, was so overcome with grief she was admitted to hospital after the repossession of the Rainbow Ark Animal Sanctuary in Willington, County Durham

Work: Ms Campbell has devoted 20 years to looking after sick and homeless animals and her sanctuary has successfully re-homed thousands of cats and dogs throughout the North-East

Long battle: Following years of court cases and appeals, bailiffs acting on behalf of Redstone Mortgages arrived to take possession of the sanctuary due to thousands of pounds owed in payment arrears

The RSPCA is now taking care of the 342 animals left behind – including hens, cats, horses, ferrets, llamas, terrapins and

tortoises.
 The Rainbow Ark Animal Sanctuary has relied solely upon donations since
 its creation 20 years ago. And Miss Campbell, a committed ­Christian, 
has devoted most of her life to looking after sick and homeless animals.

Her sanctuary has successfully re-homed thousands of cats and dogs throughout the North East of England.

But the cost of ­supporting the animals was crippling Miss Campbell, with the cost of feeding them rising to £1,000 a month.

Bailiffs
 acting on behalf of Redstone Mortgages arrived to take possession of 
the sanctuary at Milkup Bank Farm, in Willington, County Durham, on 
Wednesday.

Miss Campbell, 
47, along with members of her family and volunteers, then staged a 
desperate last stand. A wooden pole and a tree trunk were laid across 
the track while the protesters blockaded the gate with a van and Land 
Rover.

Miss Campbell fell to the ground as the bailiffs moved in.

'Paula had what we thought was a heart attack. She’s losing her home, her life and all of her animals'

Jonathon Proctor, volunteer

Her daughter, Jayne, was given just five minutes to gather all their possessions and pet dogs and get off the land.

Jonathon
 Proctor, 21, who was a volunteer at the centre, said: ‘At about 12pm an
 army of bailiffs, police and locksmiths arrived. Paula had what we 
thought was a heart attack.

‘She’s
 losing her home, her life and all of her animals. We have done 
everything we can do to keep the sanctuary, but it’s made no difference.
 We are devastated – all of us here and especially Paula have only ever 
had the best interests of the animals at heart.

‘We’ve got to now find 300 homes for all these animals.’

Animal sanctuary: In July 2012, Ms Campbell was given a reprieve to raise the £25,000 she needed to pay off the arrears, but she was unable to do so

Jayne
 Campbell said: ‘My mum is a hard woman and a real fighter, but she was 
just tired with it after fighting these people for so long.’

She
 added that her mother had discharged herself from hospital after the 
ordeal but was still in shock. In July 2012 Miss Campbell was given a 
reprieve to raise the £25,000 she needed to pay off her arrears but 
rising bills meant this was not possible.

An
 RSPCA spokesman confirmed that the charity was looking after the 
animals while Miss Campbell decided what to do with them all.

He said: ‘Those animals who were reliant upon electricity were taken to a vets at that time, where their needs are being met.

‘We
 have five officers on site who are assisting with the feeding and 
watering of the animals in situ

'It's been a horrible ordeal for the animals - two of our cats have run away and the dogs were obviously scared'

Jayne, Paula Campbell's daughter

and are giving advice to the people who 
are currently responsible for them to ensure their welfare is secure. 
Vets have also been called in on RSPCA advice to check over all of the animals.’

In
 2010, Redstone Mortgages ­Limited was fined £630,000 by the Financial 
Services Authority for its poor treatment of some customers facing 
mortgage arrears.

The FSA identified a series of failings, including customers being hit with unfair and excessive charges.

A
 company spokesman said: ‘Redstone takes its obligations very seriously 
and will take all necessary steps to ensure the welfare of all the 
animals at the property.’
