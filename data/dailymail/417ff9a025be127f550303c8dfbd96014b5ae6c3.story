Three people were killed and three deputies injured in a shootout after a domestic dispute at North Carolina mobile home park Wednesday, law enforcement officials said.

Deputies were called to the Crystal Springs Mobile Home Park southwest of downtown Fayetteville for the dispute between a grandfather and a grandson about 7 a.m., Cumberland County Sheriff Moose Butler told local media outlets.

There, he said, gunfire was exchanged with one person, who was among the three killed. Shots were fired while deputies were inside the home.

Deputies did not immediately say whether the other people died in the domestic dispute or in the shootout.

Though police spokeswoman Debbie Tanna said the suspected shooter ran from the home and was apprehended after being shot by a nearby street.

According to the newspaper, the suspect was firing an assault rifle from a wooded area off Saltwood Road.

Jermarl Eppes, 30, lives across from where the shooting occurred and told The Fayetteville Observer he heard two shots and looked out the window and saw a man with a gun.

'I watched him unload his gun,' Eppes said. 'It was like a movie. It was pretty scary.'

Another neighbor, Danny McGirt, said he heard the gunshots from his home.

'It sounded like somebody was banging on the door, and then I said "Hell no, that's gunshots,"' he said.

The names of those involved have not been released and the nature of the dispute isn't clear.

One of the injured deputies underwent surgery for gunshot wounds and was in stable condition, Butler said.

A second was treated at the scene for a grazing wound. There were no details about the injury to the third officer.

It was unclear whether anyone was in custody.

A spokeswoman for the sheriff's department did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press.

The State Bureau of Investigation was at the scene, standard procedure for officer-involved shootings.

Members of a forensics team were in the nearby woods looking for evidence.
