Tests for trainee teachers will be radically toughened up to boost the calibre of staff entering schools.

A review ordered by Education Secretary Michael Gove found that existing English and maths tests taken by applicants are too easy, with many questions pitched merely at the level of grade D at GCSE.

Changes to make the tests tougher will include a ban on using calculators in the maths test and a new writing exercise in English to assess vocabulary.

Learning: Under new proposals, from next September, anyone who wants to train as a teacher will have to complete revamped tests in English and maths

All applicants for teacher training will be required to sit the tests, which will be raised to standards equivalent to grade B at GCSE within three years.

Trainees will also have to sit a new reasoning test designed to assess their powers of logic and deduction. Verbal, numerical and abstract reasoning will be examined.

Good marks in the tests may be linked to higher bursaries under proposals being considered by ministers. Top graduates currently qualify for training incentives of up to £20,000.

Reports from Ofsted inspectors suggest some staff have a poor grasp of their subjects, leading to gaps in children’s knowledge. Yet 98 per cent of teacher trainees pass the current selection tests.

About one in five need to resit at least once in order to pass.

The review panel led by Sally Coates, principal of Burlington Danes Academy in West London, found some questions ‘are not sufficiently demanding, appearing to be in some cases below the level of GCSE grade C’.

In maths, the emphasis was on ‘simple’ calculations. In English, assessment of key skills was excluded.

Passing the numeracy test has been a requirement of Qualified Teacher Status since 2000, and literacy the following year.

Until last month, trainees only sat the tests towards the end of their courses. The new changes will be phased in from next September, with the reasoning test introduced from 2014.

Candidates will be limited to two resits. If they fail three times, they will be barred from applying for teacher training for two years.

Expectations: David Laws said many children were led to believe top exam grades were beyond them

Liberal Democrat David Laws 
said yesterday that too many children were led to believe that top exam 
grades, places at elite universities and professional careers were 
beyond them.

Mr Laws added that even in relatively 
affluent areas many young people saw a job with one of the big local 
employers as the limit of their ambition.

‘Teachers,
colleges, careers advisers have a role and a responsibility to aim for 
the stars and to encourage people to believe they can reach the top in 
education and employment,’ Mr Laws said.

‘That’s not happening as much as it should.’

The comments by Mr Laws were his first remarks on education since his return to Government in last month’s reshuffle.

He
quit as the Coalition’s Chief Secretary to the Treasury in May 2010 
after it was revealed he had been guilty of an expenses fiddle totalling
more than £50,000.

The 
minister, a former City banker who was privately educated, told the 
Daily Telegraph that many young people outside London believed that 
high-flying careers in law, journalism or banking were effectively 
closed to them.

‘Even in my 
own constituency, Yeovil, which would not be regarded as one of the 
deprivation blackspots of the country, most young people would regard 
going into investment banking as almost leaving the country, because 
it’s a different world,’ he said.

‘They will often be encouraged to think it is beyond them.’

The
comments by Mr Laws, a close ally of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, 
are likely to infuriate further teaching unions already at loggerheads 
with ministers over the Coalition’s education reforms.

Here are some questions from the current literacy and numeracy tests and proposed questions from the new maths and English papers. Scroll down for the answers.

Current numeracy test:

(Calculator allowed)

An ICT teacher compares the cost of building a paper-based ICT portfolio with the cost of using commercial e-portfolio software. The number of pupils on the course is 125. On average each paper-based portfolio includes 75 printed pages.

Costs are: printing - 2.5p per page; ring binder - 75p.

The total cost of the e-portfolio software is £250.00 per year.

How much money would the school save by using the e-portfolio software? Give your answer to the nearest pound.

The cost, £C, of advertising in a newspaper is worked out using the formula: C = 0.4n + 0.75 where n is the number of words in the advertisement.

a) The cost of an advertisement is £11.55. How many words are in the advertisement?

b) If I have only £9.00, how many words can I afford?

Proposed English paper:Continuous prose question: 'Every teacher is a teacher of English. Discuss.'

ANSWERS: £78; 'relieved'; 27 words; 20 words
