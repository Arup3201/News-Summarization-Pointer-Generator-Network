Research by a team of European physicists could explain why the universe did not collapse immediately after the Big Bang.

Studies of the Higgs particle suggested that the very early accelerating universe should have been unstable - and scientists have been trying to work out why this was not the case.

But this latest study suggests that the Higgs boson may have actually interacted in gravity in such a way that enabled the universe to survive.

Physicists from Imperial College London say gravity saved the early universe (evolution of the cosmos shown). They say it interacted with the Higgs boson to provide stability 13.8 billion years ago. It was thought the Higgs particle should have made the cosmos unstable, but gravity helped to provide stability

Physicists from Imperial College London, and the Universities of Copenhagen and Helsinki believe this simple explanation could explain the beginning of the universe. 

In the new study in Physical Review Letters, the team describe how the spacetime curvature - in effect, gravity - provided the stability needed for the universe to survive expansion in that early period 13.8 billion years ago.

The team investigated the interaction between the Higgs particles and gravity, taking into account how it would vary with energy.

And they showed that even a small interaction would have been enough to stabilise the universe against decay.

The Higgs boson's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass.

It has been described as the ‘missing piece’ of the Standard Model, which explains how the parts of the universe that we understand interact with one another

Without this mass, particles would zip around the cosmos, unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people.

The particle was confirmed using the Large Hadron Collider - the highest-energy particle collider ever made, built by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 2012.

However, our knowledge of particle physics is still far from complete, with mysteries such as the nature of dark matter to still be solved.

It was thought that, under current models of physics, Higgs particles would have been created in abundance in the early universe and caused instability, ultimately leading to its demise.

But the researchers found that, at high levels of gravity not possible to recreate in the present day on Earth, gravitational fields actually prevented the production of these Higgs particles.

Professor Arttu Rajantie, from the Department of Physics at Imperial College London who was part of the study, told MailOnline this means that our current models of physics are capable of explaining this instability in the early universe - whereas previously they had been thought to be inadequate.

This is because they predict that the production of Higgs particles should cause the universe to collapse.

But Professor Rajantie's study suggests that under our current Standard Model of physics, gravity would actually have come to the rescue and prevented them from forming.

‘We considered the interaction of the Higgs field with the gravitational field, and this is something that is not known because we can’t measure it in particle accelerators,’ he said.

‘We looked at this interaction and basically you need to have a strong gravitational field to act as a barrier against producing Higgs particles in the very early universe.’

He explains that the production of Higgs particles would have caused instability but ‘gravity prevented it’, allowing the universe to survive. 

However proving this is true would be difficult, as it would require similar gravitational strength to a black hole, but Professor Rajantie says it is a promising solution as to how the universe remained stable in the fraction of a  second after it formed.

'The Standard Model of particle physics, which scientists use to explain elementary particles and their interactions, has so far not provided an answer to why the universe did not collapse following the Big Bang,' Professor Rajantie said in a press release.

'Our research investigates the last unknown parameter in the Standard Model - the interaction between the Higgs particle and gravity.

'This parameter cannot be measured in particle accelerator experiments, but it has a big effect on the Higgs instability during inflation.

'Even a relatively small value is enough to explain the survival of the universe without any new physics!'

The team plan to continue their research using cosmological observations to look at this interaction in more detail and explain what effect it would have had on the development of the early universe.

In particular, they will use data from current and future Esa missions measuring cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational waves.

'Our aim is to measure the interaction between gravity and the Higgs field using cosmological data,' said Professor Rajantie.

'If we are able to do that, we will have supplied the last unknown number in the Standard Model of particle physics and be closer to answering fundamental questions about how we are all here.'

This meant it would not have survived much longer than a split second

But a small interaction with gravity would have provided stability at the high energy present in the universe.

This ultimately led to the formation of galaxies, stars and planets
