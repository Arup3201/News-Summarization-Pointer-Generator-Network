Britain is set to be blasted by more blustery showers this evening with wind making temperatures appear much colder, according to forecasters.

Rain, which battered coastlines in the west, will head east throughout the evening, becoming heavier throughout the night. Temperatures will struggle to get above 5-6C but will feel much cooler, the Met Office said.

In Wales today gale force storms hit the seaside town of Aberystwyth. In Scotland a family escaped being crushed after 50mph winds brought a massive tree crashing through their home.

An estimated £100,000 of damage has been caused to the garage and a car 
parked outside the property in Bridge of Don, Aberdeen, and the family 
living there have been forced to abandon their home.

Owner Pamela Foster, 42, recalled the horrifying moment the tree crashed through the family home on Wednesday night. She said: 'I was sitting in the house with my two daughters at the time when it struck just after 7pm.

'It wasn't a loud crashing noise, it was more of a crushing noise. I looked out of the window, but I couldn't see anything because it was dark.

'When I opened the front door the light showed this massive tree lying there in our driveway and that was when we saw it had smashed through the garage too.

'It is a really sturdy building and the tree just ploughed through it.'

The tree narrowly avoided the bedroom of her daughters Kayleigh, 15, and Rebecca, 13.

A spokeswoman from Grampian Fire and Rescue Service said: 'It was one large tree which fell through a double garage on to a street lamp.'

Waves battered the coast, in Aberystwyth this morning as boats battled against the choppy waters.

Tonight there will be clear spells and
 blustery showers away from Scotland, which will be hit by persistent 
rain and hill snow, but thickening cloud in southern Britain will bring 
heavy rain.

Morning rain in
 the South will clear to sunny spells and showers for much of the UK 
tomorrow.

But early rain in Scotland will push to northern England as 
the day goes on, bringing colder conditions.

It
 will be bright and breezy on Saturday with plenty of sunshine, before 
clouding over in Scotland.

Most areas will stay largely dry, but North 
Sea coastal counties will see scattered snow showers.

It
 comes after Britain woke up to more showers and gales yesterday.

Gusts 
of 75 to 85mph had been recorded across the Northern Isles, Western Isles 
and north-west Scotland.

Beleaguered Britons continue to suffer from the effects of last week's Big Freeze, with torrential rain plus the Big Thaw causing flooding in low-lying areas.

Meanwhile survivors and relatives of those who died in one of the UK's worst peacetime disasters will today pause to remember the floods of 1953, sixty years on.

The Great Flood battered the east coast of England as high spring tides, deep atmospheric low pressure and exceptionally strong northerly gales led to sea water surging over coastal defences and sweeping two miles inland.

By the morning of February 1, the death toll on land was estimated at 307 in English coastal towns and villages. Many more died on the continent and at sea.

The UK is 'better prepared than ever before' to respond to major flooding, the Environment Minister has said today. 

Sixty years ago, the Great Flood battered the east coast of England as high spring tides, deep atmospheric low pressure and exceptionally strong northerly gales led to sea water surging over coastal defences and sweeping two miles inland.

By the morning of February 1, the death toll on land was estimated at 307 in English coastal towns and villages. Many more died on the Continent and at sea.

It has been named one of the country's worst peace time disasters.

Today, Environment Minister Richard Benyon will attend a commemorative service in Humberside and visit the Hull Barrier, which has had a £10million refurbishment over the last 18 months.

He said: 'The floods of 1953 saw the terrible loss of over 300 lives and devastating damage to thousands of homes.

'The tragedy was made all the worse by the fact that no flood warning system was in place.

'Today, people have a much better chance to protect their lives, loved ones and possessions and stay safe by signing up for the Environment Agency flood warnings.

'While the risk of extreme weather has never gone away, the country is better prepared than ever before to respond to major flooding and I thank the emergency services and Environment Agency for their hard work during the recent floods.'

The Environment Agency said that, despite major improvements to sea defences and warning systems, 1.3 million people or one in 25 homes in England and Wales remain at risk of coastal flooding.

The situation is likely to be exacerbated in coming years as a result of climate change, the agency added.
