French police used tear gas and rubber bullets on visiting Everton fans in Lille's main square, according to reports.

Flares have also been set off and glass bottles thrown in the main square ahead of Everton's clash with the French side in the Europa League on Thursday evening. 

An Everton fan was even hit in the head by a tear gas cannister, according to reports.

'The club has been made aware of an isolated incident in a bar in Lille on Wednesday evening in which a number of Evertonians were attacked by a group of around 50 local men.

'The club understands that two Everton fans suffered minor facial injuries and were taken to the local hospital and that this was the only incident in what was otherwise a good-natured evening in the city centre.

'The club are in continual contact with Merseyside police officers who are in Lille today (Thursday) and the city's police representatives. 'Supporters travelling to tonight's match are advised to utilise the travel information provided on the official website where updates on any safety matters will also be provided.' 

Fans rushed from the square rubbing their eyes after large explosions were set off and tear gas thrown, onlookers claim.

One fan even alleged the trouble started when Everton fans were singing an ode to right back Seamus Coleman - only for riot police to storm into the main square. 

The Toffees' official Twitter account also sent out a message saying: 'We advise Everton fans in Lille to avoid the main square in the city centre.' Official confirmation is being sought on the alleged actions of the police. 

This occurred after a group of Everton fans were attacked in a seemingly unprovoked attack in Lille city centre late on Wednesday night. 

Up to 100 hooded Lille supporters ambushed English fans drinking outside the city's Australian bar close to 10pm local time after a peaceful day in the northern French city in which supporters of both clubs seemed to be getting along. 

Police arrived on the scene within minutes to disperse the trouble with gas but eye witnesses reported a number of injuries with some Everton fans suffering bloodied head wounds. 

Early reports say the attack started when a group of visiting fans were smoking outside the bar and were attacked by an apparently well-organised group of French hooligans.

A doorman at the bar told the Liverpool Echo: 'The atmosphere was nice all day. The Everton fans were singing, showing us their flags and having fun. All very respectful. In the evening they watched the Liverpool game and towards the end of that match it happened. It was bad.

'The Lille hooligans just appeared from the Place Louise de Bettignies across the road, from a side street, and just ran at the pub. There were some Everton fans outside smoking and they got caught cold.

'The hooligans picked up chairs we had stacked up outside and attacked them while others used them to smash windows and try to get inside.

'We had to try and stop the Everton supporters inside from getting out to help because it would have got far worse. I went out to try and drag them in.

'I saw one older English guy being punched by about three Lille hooligans. His face was bleeding badly. I am so sorry for what happened.'

Windows were smashed forcing the bar to be closed early as police waded in to quell the trouble, although some Everton fans complained of heavy-handed treatment.

TV commentator Sam Matterface, who will be covering the game for ITV4 on Thursday alongside pundit Clarke Carlisle, said: 'Not a great night in the Australian Bar in Lille. EFC (Everton) fans claiming they were attacked . We walked into it late - blue lights, police, gas.' 

The sudden burst of violence was in contrast to a pleasant day in Lille when the first of several thousand Everton fans expected for the match arrived by plane or at the Eurostar train terminal.

There may be up to 7,000 fans from Merseyside in town by kick-off and police are certain to up their presence and may seek to impose an alcohol ban around the stadium.
