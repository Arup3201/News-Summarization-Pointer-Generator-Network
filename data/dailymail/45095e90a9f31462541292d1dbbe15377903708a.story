Diverse and beautiful with a bustling capital, the remarkable Andes and the wildlife wonder of the Galapagos on its doorstep, Ecuador is also safe, cheap, warm and welcoming to expats. 

For these reasons and more the South American country has been named the best country in the world to retire in according to InternationalLiving.com's Annual Global Retirement Index.

Panama, Mexico, Malaysia and Costa Rica complete the top five in the 25-nation list, with Spain the top European destination in sixth and Malaysia the best place to spend one's twilight years in Asia.

The UK failed to crack the top 25. 

The index factors in eight categories judged by experts who live in the respective countries including real estate prices, special benefits for retired expats such as discounts on transport and education and the cost of living in general, though this does factor in flights to the United States.

Other important elements include how easy it is for expats to fit in, the variety of entertainment and amenities, the all-important health care systems, the quality of roads, public transport and general infrastructure, and climate.

'The world's top retirement havens for 2015 may dot the landscape from Asia to Latin America to Europe, but they share certain assets,' said Jennifer Stevens, executive editor of InternationalLiving.com.

'They're safe, offer good value and are places you can settle with relative ease.' 

Ecuador scored 92.7 out of a possible 100 points, and excelled in climate, property costs and discounts on flights, public transportation and utilities offered by the government for retirees.

InternationalLiving.com gave high marks to Ecuador's cost of living and plentiful outdoor attractions

Panama in Central America finished second in the Annual Global Retirement Index

'Although prices have risen slightly in recent years, Ecuador's real estate is the best value you'll find anywhere,' said Dan Prescher, senior editor at the website.

Panama in second is commended for its Pensionado visa, which is available to anyone with a lifetime pension of more than $1,000 (approximately £650). The visa offers discounts on medical services, entertainment, meals, air fares, as well as electricity and phone bills.

'For under $2,000, a couple can live comfortably in a country with a well-earned earned reputation for being expat-friendly,' according to the website.

In sixth place overall Spain was Europe's top retirement nation thanks to its warm climate and low cost of living compared with other European countries. Spain scored top marks for infrastructure, a health-care system recognized by the World Health Organisation as one of the best in the world, and entertainment.

Neighboring Portugal came in at No 9, followed by Thailand, which won points for low health care costs, culture and affordable housing. Seventh-place Malta and Colombia at No 8 completed the top ten.

Malaysia, the top retirement country in Asia, earned its kudos for how easy it is to fit in, and its entertainment and amenities, along with its low living costs - a meal with a bottle of wine can cost as little as $5 and a visit to the doctor just $15.
