A mum was drawn into a quarter-of-a million pound illicit drugs plot when she went on a last minute holiday with her married lover.

Eva Makunova thought it was a 'nice surprise' when Maros Kristoff said he was treating her to a week long luxury break in The Gambia.

But Newcastle Crown Court heard during the holiday the mum-of-three was duped into becoming a drugs mule and ordered to carry a specially converted suitcase to bring a haul of cocaine and crystal meth through customs and into the UK.

When the pair were stopped at Newcastle International Airport in May, customs officials found over 2.7g of cocaine in Kirstoff’s luggage and over 1.4kg of crystal meth being carried by Makunova.

Judge Paul Sloan QC jailed dad-of-four Kristoff, 33, of Stanley Road, Edmonton, London, for six years and Makunova, 45, of Sebastopol Road, Edmonton, London, for four-and-a-half years.

They had both pleaded guilty to importation of class A drugs.

In her basis of plea to the court Makunova said Kristoff treated her 'very badly' while they were in Africa and he kept all the money, passports and mobile phones, meaning she had no option but to travel back to the UK with him.

Her statement of plea reads: 'Immediately prior to the return trip she realised he had involved her in something unlawful, she was in Africa, could not speak the language and didn’t know what to do.'

Makunova gave a full account to investigators after she was arrested.

Judge Sloan said he accepted Makunova had been 'exploited' and had a limited function in the illegal enterprise.

Snared: The couple were jailed for drug offences at Newcastle Court

Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'She said he was her boyfriend, although he was married with children and would see each ther once a week.

'He said on the Sunday or Monday before he was going to take her on holiday.

'She thought it was a nice surprise.'

Customs officials found the drugs after their suitcases were scanned.

The cases were found to have an 'inner shell', with the drugs hidden in a special compartment between that and the outer shell.

The court heard Kristoff had been on a 'dummy run' to The Gambia shortly before the smuggling.

The flights had been paid for in cash at travel agents in Newcastle by a third party.

Gul Nawaz Hussain, defending, said Kristoff got involved in the drugs plot when he fell into debt which he struggled to pay back.

Mr Hussain said Kristoff was promised his debts would be wiped off in exchange for the drugs run.

He added: 'He does not accept he treated her badly while they were there.

However, in the same breath, he acknowledges by getting her involved in this he has to bear responsibility and he does.'

Christopher Mitford, defending Makunova said: 'This has been totally devastating for her, she plainly regrets ever becoming involved in this.

'She has never taken any illicit drug in her life.

'She is naive.'
