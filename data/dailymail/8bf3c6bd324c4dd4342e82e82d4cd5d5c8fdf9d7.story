Marouane Fellaini would agree that he became something of a scapegoat at Manchester United last season. It was so tough, in fact, that he says he had to call on the support of his family to endure the considerable pressure.

The one major signing David Moyes was able to make as United’s new manager, Fellaini found himself under more scrutiny than he perhaps should have been when he was far from alone in performing below his usual high standards.

Moyes had sympathy for the midfielder he lured from Everton, saying as much in a column in the Mail on Sunday earlier this month.

But here, after making his third consecutive start under Louis van Gaal in Saturday’s 1-0 defeat of Crystal Palace, was Fellaini’s take on what was a tough situation for a player who was so impressive at Goodison Park.

Asked if he did feel like a ‘scapegoat’ last season,’ he replied: ‘Yes, a little bit.’ But sensitive to where a discussion of the issue might lead him, he then said: ‘That is a difficult question. It is difficult to answer that.’

But it was a difficult time for him too. ‘I agree last season was tough,’ he said. ‘There was a new manager and it was difficult for all the players.

‘My family helped me through it. But I didn’t lose faith in myself. In football you have to be strong in the head. The mentality is important and I do have this quality so I can keep going.’

Some strong displays for Belgium in the World Cup also helped to heal any mental scars.

‘I was also in the national team for Belgium at the World Cup and I played well and the team also played well,’ he said. ‘For my confidence that was important.

‘I came back after the summer confident. The manager said to me I would have to fight if I wanted to play. I did fight and trained hard and that was it. When I got my chance I tried to show myself and tried to do my best.

‘Last season was a difficult season for me. The World Cup helped me a lot. The manager of the national team and the players helped me and it was a great experience for everybody.’

Fellaini would prefer to move on from a season that became more difficult when Moyes was sacked only 10 months after signing him. 

‘David knew my qualities,’ he said. ‘That is why he bought me. He knew what I can do and that is why I am here. But I am happier now I am playing. When you are playing you are always happy. But I have worked hard and I will work hard to play every game.’

If there was speculation about his future during the summer, Fellaini said he had no doubts he would still be at United this season. ‘It was all speculation,’ he said. ‘In football it is like this. But I signed for Manchester United for four years and the manager never said to me that I had to go, so I worked for my place and that was it.

‘I am fit now and that is why I am better. When I am super fit I will be better I am sure. I was injured earlier this season (he had an ankle injury). They said I had to have surgery but I didn’t. 

'It was a bad injury but now I am better and I can look forward. At the moment the manager is using me as a box-to-box player and I am trying to score a goal.’

He might be operating as a box-to-box midfielder but even after Van Gaal opted for his third formation in 12 matches, Fellaini had to perform two jobs against Palace. Firstly in a more offensive role alongside Wayne Rooney and then in a more defensive one alongside Daley Blind.

Asked to explain what he thinks Van Gaal is trying to achieve, Fellaini said: ‘It is about organisation and keeping the ball better. You have to close down when you lose the ball. It is a new philosophy.

‘When you bring in a new manager you have to wait because it is not easy to bring in a new philosophy but we are working hard in training. The manager has a lot of meetings to help us improve so we will see what happens in time. I am more comfortable here now. I know the players and the people who work in the club and that is important.’
