Accused: Nina Koistinen, pictured, is alleged to have suffocated the newborn baby at her home by pinching her nose and holding her hand over her mouth

A mother of nine has admitted killing her six day old daughter because 'she had too many kids.'

Nina Koistinen is alleged to have suffocated the newborn baby at her home by pinching her nose and holding her hand over her mouth.

The 36-year-old initially told her husband she had fallen asleep on the baby called Maya while feeding her in bed at home in Phoenix, Arizona.

But she later admitted to suffocating the infant and said she had too many children.

She also said she was jealous of the attention the newborn was getting from her husband Bradley.

According to police Koistinen's husband found his six day-old daughter unresponsive on April 8th.

The newborn girl was rushed to hospital where she was pronounced dead.

Court documents show that 'possible signs of suffocation' were discovered during an autopsy, and police looked into child protection service reports on the mother of nine.

A review of past Child Protective Services records found Koistinen had made statements about wanting to smother some of her children and about wanting her children to go to heaven in a vehicle accident that appeared intentional, according to court documents.

Detectives interviewed her a second time and said she admitted to smothering the baby.

According
to the police report, the baby's father was put in the interview room 
with Koistinen and she 'admitted to him that she pinched Maya's nose, 
twisted, suffocated and smothered baby Maya.'

At Koistinen's initial appearance in court, her husband told the judge that she 'suffers from bipolar, schizophrenia and depression' and they have tried for years to manage it.

'She's been mixed up before where she, you know, thinks I'm God or when she's not on her medication, things aren't right and she needs serious mental help,' said Bradley Koistinen as he choked back tears.

'She has been the greatest mother ... to our kids. Never once has hurt any of our kids,' he added.Koistinen is being held on a secured bond of $1 million.
