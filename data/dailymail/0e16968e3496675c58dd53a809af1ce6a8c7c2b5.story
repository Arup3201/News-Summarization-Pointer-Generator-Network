It's news that will allow women to save a small fortune on bikini waxing trips, Immac cream and razorblades: pubic hair is back in vogue.

More and more ladies are shunning heavy-duty intimate grooming in favour of maintaining a more natural look, which men say they do in fact prefer on their partners.

In a backlash against the bald Barbie look, 51 per cent of women do not style or groom their pubic hair, while 45 per cent admit to no longer being bothered to continue with their hair-removal regime.

Moreover, 62 per cent say their partner prefers them to be au naturel downstairs, according to a survey by UK Medix.

Celebrities including Gwyneyth Paltrow (who has admitted 'rocking a 70s vibe down there') and Lady Gaga (who requested a mannequin with full pubic hair on tour) have recently admitted to preferring a more hirsute look down below, and many of us are following suit.

Writing in the Telegraph, Beverly Turner credited Times columnist Caitlin Moran's feminist bible How To Be A Woman with encouraging women to sport the natural look rather than that of the typically bald porn star.

In her book she explains that the fashion for hairlessness is simply the result of people watching too much pornography, and young girls being convinced they should look that way.

But when it comes to those who do have a strict under-knicker beauty regime, 33 per cent shave, 15 per cent use hair-removal cream, and 27 per cent favour professional waxing.
