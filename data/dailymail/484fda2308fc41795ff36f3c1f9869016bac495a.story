They are trained to forecast trouble on the horizon.

Gaffe: The multi-talented weather woman danced her way through the technical issue

Weather anchor Lisa Hidalgo was regaling viewers with details of the snowfall in Colorado, U.S., in a report for the Channel 7 News on Denver's KMGH-TV.

The broadcast was proceeding smoothly until the camera angle suddenly dropped - revealing the studio floor to the TV audience instead of the computerised image of a snow-covered Winter Park.

After realising what had happened, Ms Hidalgo improvised a tap-dancing routine to a soundtrack of her own singing.

Professional to the last, she then crouched on all fours on the floor and looked up into the camera to sign off - much to the amusement of her colleagues in the studio.

A clip of the broadcast has been watched more than 90,000 times on YouTube.
