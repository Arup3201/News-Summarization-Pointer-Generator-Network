It is the supermodel look that many people aspire too, but it seems our early ancestors may have naturally had waif-like hips and thin legs.

Scientists examining a 1.9 million year old pelvis and femur have found that a now extinct species of early human had very different bodies to our own.

The fossil is thought to belong to either Homo rudolfensis or Homo habilis, two species of human ancestor that evolved in Africa.

While scientists have long studied the different skull shapes and facial features of these species, they are now turning their attention to their bodies.

According to research led by anthropologists at the University of Missouri, these early Homo species far thinner narrow pelvises and thigh bones compared to our own species, Homo sapien and another extinct human species Homo erectus.

55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve

15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon

8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge

5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas

4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's 

2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 

2.8 million years ago - The first members of the Homo family appeared in Africa as shown by the LD 350-1 fossil discovered in Ethiopia 

2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis is first thought to have appeared in Africa

1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record

1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation

800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly

400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia

200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa 

40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe 

Their hip joints, however, were very similar to modern humans - unlike in chimpanzees where the hip is much flatter and higher than in humans.

This would have given these early humans an upright posture but with narrow hips and spindly legs.

Professor Carol Ward, a pathologist at the University of Missouri's school of medicine who studied the remains, said: 'What these new fossils are telling us is that the early species of our genus, Homo, were more distinctive than we thought.

'They differed not only in their faces and jaws, but in the rest of their bodies too.

'The old depiction of linear evolution from ape to human with single steps in between is proving to be inaccurate.

'We are finding that evolution seemed to be experimenting with different human physical traits in different species before ending up with Homo sapiens.'

The fossilised pelvis and femur fossils were found at the Koobi Fora site on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana, in the Rift Valley of Kenya.

Originally a fragment of a femur was discovered at the site in 1980 but a later excavation in 2009 revealed a new femur fragment and a piece of pelvis.

Scientists have now found that the femur fragments are part for the same leg and belong the the same individual as the pelvis.

Scientists have dated the fossils at around 1.9 million years old.

As the oldest fossils of Homo erectus to be found are 1.8 million years old, they concluded that the fossilised bones may belong to to one to two other early human species around at the time - Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis.

There are almost no skeletal pieces in the fossil record for these two species so the discovery has provided scientists a rare glimpse at how they may have looked.

The researchers, whose study is published in the Journal of Human Evolution, used CT scans of the fossilised pelvis and femur to compare them to those of other species of primate, early human and modern humans.

They concluded that the skeletons of early human ancestors may have quite different structures to our own.

Most studies on how early Homo species would have looked have focused on the skull and facial features as can be seen in the above reconstruction of Homo habilis (left) and the skull of Homo rudolfensis (right)

Professor Ward said: 'This new specimen has a hip joint like all other Homo species, but it also has a thinner pelvis and thighbone compared to Homo erectus.

'This doesn’t necessarily mean that these early human ancestors moved or lived differently, but it does suggest that they were a distinct species that could have been identified not just from looking at their faces and jaws, but by seeing their body shapes as well.

'Our new fossils, along with the other new specimens reported over the past few weeks, tell us that the evolution of our genus goes back much earlier than we thought, and that many species and types of early humans coexisted for about a million years before our ancestors became the only Homo species left.'

Fossilised pelvis and femur from early human found in Rift Valley, Kenya

Scientists believe they belong to either Homo rudolfensis or Homo habilis

@highlight

The fossil femur and pelvis are far narrower than those of modern humans

This suggests our  ancestors had thinner legs and hips than Homo sapiens

The fossils show early humans had varied body shapes as well as skulls
