Shocking images of Charles Saatchi grabbing Nigella Lawson by the throat were said by him to show nothing more than a ‘playful tiff’.

But now it appears the wealthy art collector’s ugly physical manhandling of his wife went further than first realised and may have lasted as long as 27 minutes.

Disturbing photographs have emerged of Saatchi repeatedly tweaking and twisting Miss Lawson’s nose, and even putting a finger in one of her nostrils.

Grab: Nigella looks tearful as her husband Charles Saatchi grabs her nose and closes her eyes as he twists it

She looks uncomfortable and upset throughout, and becomes tearful.

The pictures were taken minutes after the infamous ‘throttling’ images were captured as the pair dined outside Scott’s restaurant in Mayfair earlier this month.

The photographer who took them timed the incident at just under half an hour, describing it as ‘27 minutes of madness’.

In
 the nose-tweaking images, Saatchi is first shown lifting the end of his
 wife’s nose and apparently peering up her nostrils, as she grimaces and
 closes her eyes.She then uses a napkin to dab at her nose and eyes.

Upset: Nigella's face reveals her agony as he husband continues to twist her nose

Shortly after, Saatchi, his back to 
the camera, grabs at his wife’s nose again, and puts the tip of one of 
his fingers inside her right nostril.

She again looks upset and dabs at 
her nose with the napkin.

Initial
 photographs showing the 70-year-old former advertising tycoon grabbing 
his wife by the throat caused a furore when published a week ago.

Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault.

TV
 chef Miss Lawson, 53, apparently carried on with married life as normal
 after the incident.

But as soon as the pictures were published she left
 the £14million family home in Chelsea to live in a £10,000-a-week 
apartment in Mayfair.

She 
was seen outside on Wednesday and Friday without her wedding ring.

On 
Saturday a bulging bag of clothes was delivered, leading to speculation 
that she is settling in for a long stay.

Miss
 Lawson has two children from her first marriage to journalist John 
Diamond who died from throat cancer in 2001. She and Saatchi married ten
 years ago.

Yesterday her spokesman said she was maintaining her silence on her marriage difficulties.

But
 it emerged that in recent years she had been close to actor Paul Rhys, 
49, a father of one who appeared in the Spooks TV spy series, on one 
occasion two years ago meeting him for a two-hour lunch.

Miss Lawson 
said at the time: ‘Paul’s a friend of mine.’ Mr Rhys’s girlfriend, Arkie
 Whitely, died of cancer in the same year that Miss Lawson lost her 
first husband to the disease'.

Distress: Nigella pictured out in London as a member of her family delivers clothing to her flat on Saturday

Dining in: A tray of food is delivered to Nigella Lawson's £10,000-a-week rented Mayfair flat where she is now living after leaving the £14million family home in Chelsea

Movements: Charles Saatchi was seen leaving his home in Chelsea yesterday before jumping into a waiting cab

Concerns: As Nigella (pictured on Friday) faces a second week away from Mr Saatchi, 70, friends have said she wants him to undergo anger management therapy or counselling to control his volatile moods

A
 source told the Sunday Mirror yesterday: ‘Paul can relate to Nigella in
 the way only someone who has experienced bereavement can. He is a tower
 of strength to her on occasions.’

Another
 source, who has worked with Miss Lawson, told the newspaper it was 
obvious she and Saatchi had had ‘rocky times’ over the past two years.

The source said: ‘A lot of us involved on her telly shows knew if Nigella and Charles had been having arguments.

'It was often easy to tell if Nigella was feeling slightly upset or angry about something at home.’

Law meet: Raymond Tooth, the lawyer of Charles Saatchi and Fiona Shackleton, the lawyer for Nigella Lawson, met for a secret lunch at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair on Sunday

Yesterday, two of the country's top lawyers met for a secret lunch at the central London restaurant where Charles Saatchi grabbed the throat of his wife.

Raymond Tooth, Saatchi's lawyer, and Baroness Fiona Shackleton, Miss Lawson's lawyer, were at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, the same restaurant where Mr Saatchi was pictured arguing with his wife.

The legal experts, considered the best in the country by some, hugged and kissed as they greeted each other on Mount Street.

Tooth appeared to present Shackleton, dressed in a colourful floral outfit, with a small gift before they went inside the eatery. It is not known what the meeting was about.
