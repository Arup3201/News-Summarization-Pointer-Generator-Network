Seeking answers: Abraham Pishevar, 18, died August 25 in a plane crash with three other Case Western Reserve University students. Now his family wants to know if his death was related to the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity

Family members of one of the four Case Western Reserve University students killed in a tragic plane crash last month are considering a wrongful death lawsuit over suspicions the young men took flight as part of a fraternity recruitment event.

An attorney for Abraham Pishevar's family says the 18-year-old posted to social media messages entitled 'Rush' in which he documented the doomed plane's ascent August 25--Pishevar's first day of college classes.

Pishevar died not long after takeoff along with pilot William Felten, 20, Lucas Marcelli, 20, and John Hill, 18 when the plane struck the ground and smashed through a fence at a suburban Cleveland airport.

According to ABC News, Pishevar posted to Snapchat before the crash: 'About to go on a night flight' with the headline 'Rush.'

The plane was rented online from a local flying club for four hours starting at 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 25. None of the club's employees were at the airport when the men arrived at Cuyahoga County Airport in the Cleveland suburb of Richmond Heights. 

Felten and Marcelli were both second-year students and members of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Pishevar and Hill were both freshman.

'The Snapchat photo that you've seen which has a heading 'Rush' on it goes to what Abraham's state of mind was,' Pishevar family attorney Jamie Lebovitz told ABC.

Court docs reveal the family wants to learn more about the nature of the nighttime flight by seeking fraternity records and documents from the flying club that rented the Cessna 172R to Felten, a licensed pilot of about one year.

'Sightseeing': The four young men in the Cessna 172R died at an airport in suburban Cleveland. The other victims were pilot William Felten, 20, Lucas Marcelli, 20, and John Hill, 18. Felten and Marcelli were members of the Zeta Beta Tau frat

Rushing? Freshman Abraham Pishevar boarded the plane on the night of his first ever day as a student at Case Western. His family had no idea he may have been interested in joining a fraternity, but court documents reveal he wrote a post titled 'Rush' as he took to the air August 25

Zeta Beta Tau has been quick to distance the fraternity from the tragic event, telling ABC in a statement: 'We have been assured … that the flight was not a recruitment event.'

As they seek to learn more about what brought about his death, the Pishevars are only now learning that Abraham was even interested in joining a fraternity.

'Abraham was starting out his first day at Case Western when this tragedy happened,' said his aunt Bita Pishevar Haynes told ABC. 'No one from our family knew he was even rushing.'

The NTSB report does not indicate what might have caused the crash but lists details of what occurred before and after. The NTSB investigation could take a year or more to complete. 

According to the report released August 29:

Tragedy: Pilot William Felten, 20, (right) had his license for about a year, official said. The plane crashed in nearby Willoughby Hills at 9:48 pm Residents reported hearing an explosion as they raced toward the crash site and that the fuselage quickly caught fire, trapping the men inside

Warning signs: At around 9:45pm, Felten asked the ground controller for clearance to take off. About four minutes later, the controller informed Felten he was taxiing to the wrong runway. Felten apologized and the controller directed him to the approach end of the correct runway.

The plane was rented online from a local flying club for four hours starting at 8:30 pm on August 25. 

None of the club's employees were at the airport when the men arrived at Cuyahoga County Airport in the Cleveland suburb of Richmond Heights.

Witnesses said they saw the four men approach the plane, a single-engine Cessna, around 9pm and that one of the men had a small suitcase. One witness said the plane sat with the engine running for about 30 minutes with the men on board.

At around 9:45pm., Felten asked the ground controller for clearance to take off. About four minutes later, the controller informed Felten he was taxiing to the wrong runway. Felten apologized and the controller directed him to the approach end of the correct runway.

Felten radioed the controller two minutes after starting takeoff that 'they were not climbing fast and they wanted to immediately make a left turn to turn around.' The plane became airborne about 2,000 feet down the 5,100-foot runway, the controller said.

The plane crashed in nearby Willoughby Hills at 9:48 pm Residents reported hearing an explosion as they raced toward the crash site and that the fuselage quickly caught fire, trapping the men inside.

Lucas Marcelli (left) was a second year student along with pilot Felten and both were members of the fraternity Zeta Beta Tau. Like Pishevar, John Hill, 18, (right) was a freshman. All four died after the Cessna 172R crashed and burst into flames
