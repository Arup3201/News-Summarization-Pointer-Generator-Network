This electrifying video shows the moment a huge lightning bolt struck within feet of a man walking out of a supermarket in Florida.

The man, who calls himself Scarrrz, was walking out of a supermarket in Cape Coral when the entire shop car park lights up with a bright flash.

He can be heard saying, 'just another day in Florida', moments before the close encounter, which he just happened to be filming on the Snapchat video-sharing app.

The man, known as Scarrrz to his YouTube followers, was leaving a supermarket when the lightning struck

A huge, bright white flash filled the area as the lightning struck, followed by five deafening gunshot-like sounds

The video, which has been viewed more than 23,000 times since it was uploaded, shows a bright white bolt hitting the ground nearby.

Five large explosions, which sound like gunshots, can be heard as Scarrrz dashes back inside.

As he runs inside to a sandwich counter, he says: 'Oh my God that did not just happen. Holy....' 

On his YouTube channel, he said: 'Word of advice to everyone wanting to record a thunderstorm. Just know lightning can and WILL strike anywhere it wants to in a matter of seconds.

'That happened in Cape Coral, FL. We had a bad lighting storm last night.

'Super close Lightning Strike right near my work! So crazy! And the funniest part about it is I got it on Snapchat, and I quoted, "Just another day in Florida", right before the lightning hit.

'Crazy insane timing.'

Earlier this week a Swedish woman almost got the shock of a lifetime when lighting struck just yards in front of her as she filmed a double rainbow from the safety of her house.

Ingela Tanneskog was so taken with the calm beauty of the rainbow after a fierce storm that she pulled out her phone and started filming.

But seconds later a bolt of lightning came flashing down from the heavens and struck the woods ahead of her, accompanied with an almighty peal of thunder.
