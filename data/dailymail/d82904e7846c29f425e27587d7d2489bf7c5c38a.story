Danish restaurant Noma, crowned the world’s best restaurant three years running in one poll, on Friday apologised after 63 guests fell ill with sickness and diarrhoea after visiting the haute cuisine establishment.

According to the Danish health authorities, the guests fell ill during a five-day period in February and the outbreak could have come from a sick kitchen staff employee.

Health inspectors criticised the restaurant for not alerting authorities soon enough and for not taking proper action after the employee was struck ill upon returning home after work.

The two-Michelin-star restaurant 
recognised in a report that internal procedures had not been good enough
 and said an e-mail from the employee reporting his sickness had not 
been seen.

'We are in the business of making 
people happy and taking care of our guests, so this is the worst thing 
that could happen to us,' Noma managing director Peter Kreiner told 
Reuters.

'Since the outbreak we have worked 
closely with the health authorities to get to the bottom of it and find 
the source of infection.

'We are extremely sorry about all of 
this and I have personally been in dialogue with all the guests who were
 affected and discussed compensation for them,' he said, adding there 
was never any danger of the restaurant being closed down.

Food poisoning can have a major impact on top-end restaurants.

In 2009 British chef Heston Blumenthal
 received negative headlines and was forced to close his three-star 
restaurant The Fat Duck for around three weeks after hundreds of guests 
became ill.

Noma, known for experimental 
ingredients such as ants and fermented grasshoppers, has been voted 
winner of The S. Pellegrino and Acqua Panna World’s 50 Best Restaurants 
in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Guests flock to the Danish restaurant 
from all over the world and pay around £600 for a 12-course set menu for
 two including appetisers, treats to finish, wine pairing and a tour of 
the kitchen to meet some of the 50 chefs.

When the restaurant releases monthly bookings, two-seater tables are usually snapped up in less than an hour.

For the last three years it has 
finished on top of Restaurant magazine's list of the best restaurants in
 the world, winning its second Michelin star in 2007.

The distinguished French food guide's decision not to award the restaurant a third star last year was met with criticism.

By comparison Gordon Ramsay's eponymous Chelsea restaurant was awarded three stars.

The restaurant is known for relying on fresh and locally sourced products.

Danish newspaper Ekstra 
Bladet said that a member of the kitchen staff had been preparing food 
while ill and subsequently vomited.

The worker apparently alerted the restaurant to the incident within a week, but it did not respond to his report.
