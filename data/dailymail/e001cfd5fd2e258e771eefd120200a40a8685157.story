Kylie and Russell Cox will undoubtedly remember their wedding day for the rest of their lives, but not for the reasons you might expect.

Mrs Cox, a staff nurse from Par, Cornwall, has told how she had to give one of the guests emergency CPR after he collapsed on the dance floor from a suspected heart attack.

Still in her wedding dress, the 24-year-old managed to keep the 28-year-old man alive with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, with help of a bridesmaid and her uncle, while an ambulance was called.

The wedding reception was in full swing at the beautiful Carlyon Bay Hotel in St 
Austell, Cornwall, when the drama unfolded at around 8.30pm in front of 160 family and friends.

Staff nurse Kylie told the Daily Mirror: 'Our friend asked me for a dance, but while we were on the dance floor, he fell faint. I turned round to give him a chair and he collapsed.'

With the aide of her uncle and a bridesmaid who was also a nurse, Mrs Cox gave the guest emergency first aid, including the kiss of life, while waiting for paramedics arrived.

The newlywed couple accompanied the man 
as he was rushed to hospital where he was treated for a suspected heart 
attack but is expected to make a full recovery.

With the rest of the guests 
understandably feeling in a sombre mood, Mrs Cox's father decided to 
call a halt to what remained of the evening reception.

Kylie added: 'Me and Russell spent the first night of our marriage at the hospital, because we didn't know whether our friend was going to live or die. The doctors told us it was a miracle he survived.'

It is understood Mr and Mrs Cox, from Par, Cornwall, will hold a repeat of the celebration for family and friends at a later date.

The Carlyon Bay Hotel, which overlooks the spectacular St Austell Bay, is a popular wedding venue which can host up to 160 guests with rooms costing up to Â£280 per night.
