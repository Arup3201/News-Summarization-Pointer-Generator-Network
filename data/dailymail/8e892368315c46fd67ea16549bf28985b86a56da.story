Evangelical painter Thomas Kinkade once was revered amongst Christians as the 'Painter of Light,' known for his sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes that led to a 
commercial empire worth $100 million a year.

His life - and ultimately his death - was much less pious, and far-less glamorous.

Published reports about the years leading up to the troubled artist's death paint a much different picture than the heavenly landscapes that earned Kinkade millions - it includes drugs, alcohol, 'territorial urination' and sexual harassment.

Troubled: Christian painter Thomas Kinkade was killed by a lethal overdose of Valium and alcohol

Inspiring: Kinkade was beloved by evangelicals for his sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes

Kinkade died in April 2012 from an accidental overdose from ethanol and Diazepam intoxication, or in common terms, of alcohol and 
the tranquilizer marketed as Valium, the Santa Clara County Medical 
Examiner-Coroner's Office said at the time. 

But his heart had grown so enlarged he had been vulnerable to a fatal heart attack at any point, according to the autopsy.

In the years leading up to his death he had run into personal difficulties, including a 2010 bankruptcy filing by one of his companies and an arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence that same year outside Carmel, California.

Kinkade had been estranged from his wife of 30 years, Nanette, at the time of his death, and his body was found in the bed he shared with his girlfriend of 18 months, Amy Pinto-Walsh at his Monte Sereno home, four hours after he was last known to be alive, said Joseph O'Hara, Santa Clara County's lead medical examiner.

Some of his fingernails still held a residue of green paint, and his toenails were polished a glittery gold, the autopsy report said.

O'Hara described the 6-foot, 254-pound Kinkade as mildly obese and noted that he suffered from systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

'His heart was so big that at any time he was vulnerable,' O'Hara said. 'Apparently he had given up drinking and maybe he had just started again. His levels were definitely in the toxic range.'

Several other drugs, including two other prescription tranquilizers, were present in his bloodstream. Kinkade's urine contained gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, which occurs naturally in the human body but can also be used as the so-called date rape drug.

O'Hara said the painter also had suffered several remote blunt force injuries.

'He had a bruise of his abdomen that was healing, a bruise under his scalp, a hemorrhage under his head, as well as multiple healed rib fractures,' O'Hara said. 'He took a tumble at some point.'

The author of a recently published profile of the troubled artist on the Daily Beast website suggests that these injuries were caused by drunken tumbles he would take after drinking too much.

Kinkade's commercial successes did not endear him with the art establishment, who criticized him for appearing to appeal to the widest possible audience, his brother once told The San Jose Mercury News.

The attacks on his work and the artist's split with his wife two years ago took a toll, and he turned to alcohol over the past four or five years, Patrick Kinkade said.

'As much as he said it didn't bother him, in his heart deep down inside it would sadden him that people would criticize, so hatefully, his work and his vision, when people didn't understand him,' said Patrick Kinkade, an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas Christian University.

In a 2006 Los Angeles Times article detailing accusations made in court filings about Kinkade's treatment of employees and gallery owners, it says the artist had made several drunken scenes, including one at a Sigfried and Roy show, where he continuously shouted slurs at the entertainers.

In another case, he fell off of a bar stool and then grabbed a woman's breast.

In yet another, Kinkade is said to have urinated on a Winnie the Pooh figure outside of a Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim as part of what former employees say he called 'ritual territory marking.'

While urinating on the Pooh figure, Kinkade reportedly yelled 'this one's for you, Walt,' in reference to Disney founder Walt Disney.

Following his death, Kinkade's widow and girlfriend battled in the courts over the painter's estate, with girlfriend Amy Pinto-Walsh releasing handwritten notes allegedly written by Kinkade that are barely legible and presumably written while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

In one of the scrawls, Kinkade allegedly writes, '"I, Thomas Kinkade, being of sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto-Walsh $10,000,000 in cash from my corporate policy and I give her the house at 16324 and 16342 Ridgecrest Avenue for her security.'

The artist appears to have written these notes while under the influence of drugs or alcohol - if he wrote them at all

In an equally barely legible document released by Pinto-Walsh, Kinkade allegedly wrote 'I, Thomas Kinkade, hereby bequeath my house at 16324 Ridgecrest Avenue,
 Monte Sereno, CA to Amy Pinto in the event of my death. I also give the
 sum of $10,000,000 to Amy Pinto to be used for the establishment of the
 Thomas Kincaid Museum at 16324 Ridgecrest Avenue, Monte Sereno CA for 
the public display in perpetuity of original art. This statement is null
 and void if my relationship with Ms. Pinto ends as it is defined by me 
in a future letter.'

Nanette Kinkade and Pinto-Walsh reached a private settlement out of court over the artist's estate.

'My brother was a good man,' Patrick Kinkade tells the Daily Beast. 'The tragedy of my brother is he eventually fell to his own humanity. The triumph of my brother is that his art was never touched by that tragedy. His art was affirmation that there was hope, there was beauty, and a statement of love that wasn't touched by this.'
