A legless mother of seven, who was married to a one-legged man, has been killed by lightning as she sat outside her humble village shack in Cambodia.

In Thea, mother of four sons and three daughters all under 15, lost her legs when she stepped on a landmine left over from the civil war of the 1970s.

Her husband had lost his leg in the same way as he worked in a field.

Meas Sareth, deputy police chief of the Phnom Kravanh distric, said: 'This is a huge tragedy for this poor family, as they have many children.

'Families like this face huge struggles just to survive every day – and for the mother to be struck down by an act of nature after losing her legs to an act of man is a double tragedy.'

Lightning has proved a deadly natural disaster in Cambodia in recent years, with hundreds of people dying after being struck while in open fields.

In order to grow crops to feed their families, farmers toil through all kinds of weather – including severe thunder storms.

Although the government has launched education campaigns to try to reduce the risk, the problem has shown little sign of abating.

The authorities said another answer would be the erection of large numbers of lightning rods, but the cost has prevented any being purchased.

According to Keo Vy, a disaster management official, 100 people were killed in lightning strikes in the first 10 months of this year, while another 70 were injured. In addition, 32 cattle were killed and five homes were destroyed.

Last year a total of 165 people were killed and 139 injured by lightning.

Cambodia already has one of the highest landmine casualty rates in the world after the bombs were buried in fields throughout the country during the 1970s Civil War.

Statistics from the Cambodian Mine Victim Information Service (CMVIS) show around 850 died every year after being struck by a landmine between 2000 to 2005.

This has now declined slightly to around 350 in 2007 and about 270 in 2008.

But most families in Cambodia have been affected by landmines in some way with some having several family members with missing limbs.
