Homes and businesses close to the banks of the Mississippi are braced to evacuate as the river continues to swell following torrential rain.

The river reportedly reached its sixth highest level on record close to St Louis, Missouri, and barriers were breached yesterday forcing authorities to urge homeowners to flee their properties in a small community north of the city.

The breach of the barrier, which holds the river back close to its confluence with the Missouri River, saw two miles of land deluged by flood waters.

Officials said that the flooding threatened more than 40 homes in the small town of West Alton - a town that was mostly swept away by devastating floods in 1993.

Hundreds of residents were already evacuated after a levee set up to protect homes was breached by the river water.

More than 300 people had been asked to leave their homes on Monday night after another temporary flood barrier failed on the peninsula formed by the connection of the two swollen rivers.

Though according to reports, that warning was heeded by just 15 per cent of the population, with the rest staying put.

Residents and volunteers have been putting down sandbags and temporary defences in a bid to halt the floodwaters.

According to CBSNews, Fire Chief Rick Pender said that 'everyone else is ready to go at a moment's notice.'

Much of the flooding is currently coralled in a railroad bed which is protecting the town, he said.

Some areas of the river are reportedly well above flood stage and eight locks have been closed by officials.

The busy Port of St Louis has also been shut down.

River retreats are likely to be slowed by forecasts of further rain in parts of the area over the coming days.

A casino and a major highway have been closed off in the 28,000 resident town of Alton, Illinois, with floodwaters also swamping much of a bridge linking the city to West Alton late on Monday.
