Despite playing just five games at the World Cup, Colombia's star James Rodriguez won the Golden Boot with six goals.

The Monaco attacker, who has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid since his stunning displays in Brazil, beat Germany's Thomas Muller to the trophy by a single goal.

He was 100-1 with bookmakers to finish top scorer before the start of the tournament.

Muller would have won the award if he had scored in Germany's 1-0 extra-time win in the final against Argentina, having registered more assists than Rodriguez during the tournament.

A goal from the German attacker against Alejandro Sabella's side would have made him the first player to win the Golden Boot twice, after he won the award in South Africa in 2010 after scoring five goals.

The Bayern Munich forward failed to net at the Maracana though, meaning Rodriguez was crowned top scorer despite leaving the tournament at the quarter-final stage. 

His Colombia side were beaten 2-1 by 
Brazil at Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza, with Rodriguez scoring Jose 
Pekerman's side's goal from the spot in the 80th minute.

Rodriguez
 scored three goals in Colombia's three group games as they topped Group
 C, before notching twice against Uruguay in the last 16.

The
 first of that brace was arguably the goal of the tournament, as he 
chested the ball 30 yards from goal, glanced at where the goalkeeper was
 standing as the ball dropped, and then smashed a left-foot volley in 
off the crossbar.

His 
penalty against Brazil took his tally to six - a figure that Muller and 
Lionel Messi were unable to match despite playing two more games than 
the 23-year-old.
