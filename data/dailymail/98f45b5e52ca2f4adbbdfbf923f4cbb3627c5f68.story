Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has encouraged Wilfried Zaha to aim for a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the European Under 21 Championship this summer.

The tricky winger scored and set up another in Palace’s win which left Queens Park Rangers deep in the relegation quagmire.

When the debate rages about who should play in the Under 21 tournaments, Barclays Premier League managers often prefer their stars to skip them.

Shaun Wright-Phillips made his first Premier League start for 770 days.

But Pardew has taken the unusual step of backing Zaha for the tournament and will speak to Southgate about including him.

‘I would love Wilf to be on that trip because that is a big tournament for England,’ Pardew said. ‘Particularly after the Champions League results this year and England didn’t do well in the World Cup so I think Gareth should have the best players available and I’m hoping Wilf is one of them. But Gareth’s choice won’t be determined by a phone call from me, he is his own man.

‘Wilf has definitely found himself a little bit more and I think Gareth would like somebody in the squad who has the kind of quality that he does. But he’s got to do it between now and the end of the year and push for a place in that squad — that should be a goal for him.’

Zaha’s counterpart on the opposite flank Yannick Bolasie also starred in the victory, twice beating QPR’s teenage right-back Darnell Furlong to get to the byline and send in low crosses — one for Zaha’s goal and the other for James McArthur to score.

Furlong was run ragged and eventually hooked at the break. Bolasie admitted he targeted the 19-year-old as a weak link in the team.

‘My aim was to go at him straight away,’ he said. ‘He ain’t going to come here and I’m not going to let him settle, so that was my aim to be honest. I know it’ s cruel, that’s football.

‘A couple of the players spoke to me and I wasn’t aware [of him], because I don’ t really look at the opposition like that. But that was the aim.’

Furlong was at least not at fault for the third goal, which came from the other flank when Zaha tricked his way through a couple of players before passing to Joel Ward to net for Palace for the very first time.

QPR’s Matt Phillips scored a goal-of-the-season contender with a 40-yard drive in the final 10 minutes, but it was too late and defeat left them four points adrift of safety.

Manager Chris Ramsey laid part of the blame on his players, saying: ‘They have realised there are only a certain amount of things you can do in preparation but you have to transfer it in the game.

‘Sometimes I go and watch games and don’t get in until 2am. Sometimes I wake up early and watch a DVD of the other teams. Me doing extra hours is not going to make any difference to them.’
