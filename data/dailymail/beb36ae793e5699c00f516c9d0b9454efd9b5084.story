Welsh speed cameras: Reverend Tudor Rowlands, 74, was caught doing 40mph in a 30mph area in Talybont but was spared a driving ban

A minister caught speeding for the fourth time in four years escaped a driving ban because it would stop him preaching to his rural congregation. 

Reverend Tudor Rowlands, 74, was caught doing 40mph in a 30mph area and already had nine points on his licence from three previous offences.

Mr Rowlands, whose congregations are in Powys, North Wales, said a ban would affect the ‘spiritual health of communities’ if he couldn’t reach elderly people who cannot get to church. 

Apologising for his speeding, he also pleaded 'exceptional hardship'  as he apologised for his speeding. 

The court heard Mr Rowlands, who has been a minister for 46 years, was still in charge of 10 chapels across a very large rural area around Welshpool.

He said he believed he had learned his lesson after being caught for a fourth time in just four years.

Prosecutor Justin Espie told the court Rowlands, of Rhewl, Ruthin, pleaded guilty to driving too fast in a 30mph zone in Talybont on May 10, 2014, reports the Powys County Times.

When the minister was stopped by police at around 10am on the morning in question he made officers aware of the fact he already had nine points on his licence.

He said he needed to be able to drive to travel across vast areas of countryside between the chapels he was responsible for and also to preach in the homes of worshippers to frail to get to church themselves.

If he was disqualified, he argued, he would no longer be able to carry out these duties.

In cross-examination, Mr Espie questioned Rowlands as to whether he would lose his job or his home as a result of being disqualified. The priest admitted he would not.

Magistrates accepted his argument of exceptional hardship and fined him £70, ordered him to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £20.

 An earlier version of this article wrongly suggested that Mr Rowlands was a vicar of the Church of Wales in fact he is a non conformist minister. We apologise for any contrary impression given.
