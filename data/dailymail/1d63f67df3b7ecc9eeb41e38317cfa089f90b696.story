I met Jamal Edwards, the founder of SB.TV, recently when we both visited my old college to talk to the students there.

I was invited back to Barking and Dagenham College for their awards presentation and they had Jamal there because he's someone who has made a career, made a whole company, from just him and a camera.

He gave a great speech about where he's come from and what he's doing. One line stood out for me.

He related a career to athletics, saying; 'Just focus on your own lane, don't worry about what anyone else is doing, what any other athletes are doing or anything else that is going on. Just focus on your own training, your own race, and you'll get the results you deserve.'

We hung out a little bit afterwards. He's a really easy guy to chat to – he's just normal – he's just a normal guy with a great business idea and he's gone and developed that and made something huge.

When I played at Dagenham they put us in that college so I stayed there for two years. They've always been very supportive of me.

I did a Q&A about how the summer went and how my career is going. I tried to get across that it's all about patience, people develop at different rates, no matter what you're doing keep concentrating on yourself and you'll get there if you work hard and you'll reach your goals.

I thought the students might be shy but they were asking me loads of questions and for advice.

Part of why I'm doing what I'm doing is to try to talk to younger guys and try to inspire them to do what they want to do. Not just in sport, in terms of music or politics or art.

I want to be a good role model and lead by example. If I can do that, then I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

I got back into training at the start of October time, trying to get my body back in shape, and it's coming together well.

At some point I'll arrange a race with Jamal. Everyone who I meet always wants to race me.

Everyone thinks they're quick and could beat me. It's only a bit of fun. My reaction: you're more than welcome to try.
