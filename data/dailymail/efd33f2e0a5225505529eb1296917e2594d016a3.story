Six days after Aaron Alexis shot and killed 12 people at the Navy Yard in Washington, DC, the National Rifle Association has issued their response.

In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday morning, Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and CEO of the NRA, said the shooting got out of control because 'there weren't enough good guys with guns' and that when 'the good guys with guns got there, it stopped'.

He said that US military bases are 'largely left unprotected' and that leaves them susceptible to attacks like the one last week at the Washington Navy Yard.

So the NRA is calling for increased security at US military bases to prevent future shootings.

'We need to look at letting the men and women that know firearms and are trained in them do what they do best which is protect and survive,' he said.

The sentiment fell in line with what LaPierre said on Meet the Press following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last December.

At the time he proposed the idea of enlisting former military and police officers as volunteer armed guards at schools.

'If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,' LaPierre said in a broadcast interview. 'I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it. It's the one thing that would keep people safe.'

While the shooting is certainly drumming up the gun licensing debate again, this time the concern lays mostly in the Defense Department's vetting of private contractors.

Alexis was recently hired as a civilian information technology contractor to work on the Navy and Marine Corps intranet and that's how he had access to the Yard that morning.

Defense Secretary Check Hagel admitted that 'something had broken down' in the vetting process since Alexis had been treated for mental illnesses.

Hagel pledged to change the system in an effort to prevent possibly dangerous people from getting contracts.

'Where there are gaps, we will close them. Where there are inadequacies, we will address them. And where there are failures, we will correct them,' Hagel said.

The shooting happened around 8:20 last Monday morning at the Washington Navy Yard and resulted in the deaths of 12 people.

Alexis had previously claimed to be suffering from PTSD after helping rescue efforts in New York following the 9/11 terror attacks.

It emerged that he used three
guns during the massacre, one of them an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle - 
the same weapon used in the Sandy Hook and Aurora mass shootings.

He was killed in one of several running gun battles with police after he entered the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters and started picking off victims in a cafeteria from a fourth-floor atrium, witnesses said.

The motive for the mass shooting - the 
deadliest on a military installation in the U.S. since the tragedy at 
Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 - was a mystery, investigators said.
