David Cameron has criticised the Pope, insisting it is wrong to suggest that those who mock Islam and other religions could 'expect a punch'.

In a highly-unusual move, the Prime Minister put himself at odds with the Pontiff, insisting someone who is offended does not have the right to 'wreak vengeance'.

The Pope caused anger last week when he suggested people 'cannot insult the faith of others', adding that he would punch someone if they offended his mother, as he debated freedom of speech in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

The hand of God: Speaking on board the Papl flight, Pope Francis Pope Francis said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not 'provoke'

Pope Francis said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not 'provoke'

The Pontiff said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not purposely anger religious people.

Speaking on board the papal plane on his way to the Philippines, he also insisted that it was an 'aberration' to kill in the name of God and that religion can never be used to justify violence.

By way of example, Pope Francis referred to Alberto Gasparri, who organises papal trips and was standing by his side aboard the papal plane. 

'If my good friend Dr Gasparri says a curse word against my mother, he can expect a punch,' Francis said, throwing a pretend punch his way. 

'It's normal. You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others. You cannot make fun of the faith of others.' 

Following the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, many people have defended the satirical magazine for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

But the Pope said there was a limit to free speech when it concerned offending someone's religious beliefs.

He said: 'There are so many people who speak badly about religions or other religions, who make fun of them, who make a game out of the religions of others.

'They are provocateurs. And what happens to them is what would happen to Dr Gasparri if he says a curse word against my mother. There is a limit.' 

However, Mr Cameron insisted that in an open society, freedom of speech as paramount.

In his interview with on US TV's Face the Nation, recorded during his visit to Washington last week, Mr Cameron said: 'I think in a free society, there is a right to cause offence about someone's religion. 

'I'm a Christian; if someone says something offensive about Jesus, I might find that offensive, but in a free society I don't have a right to wreak vengeance on them.

'We have to accept that newspapers, magazines, can publish things that are offensive to some, as long as it's within the law. That is what we should defend.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also argued that there is not right to not be offended.

Speaking in the wake of the Paris attacks, Mr Clegg told LBC radio: 'There can be no excuse, no reason, no explanation - they have killed cartoonists who have done nothing more than draw drawings which they so happen to find offensive.

"At the end of the day, in a free society people have to be free to offend each other.

'You cannot have freedom unless people are free to offend each other. We have no right not to be offended. That fundamental principle of being free to offend people…is exactly what was under threat by these murderous barbarians.'
