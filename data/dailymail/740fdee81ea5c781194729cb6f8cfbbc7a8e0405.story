It is the season for travel chaos and passengers travelling from Gatwick and Heathrow appear to have the worst experience, according to statistics.

Nearly half of all departures from the two London airports were delayed or cancelled last Christmas and New Year.

Overall, two in five UK departures (38 per cent) were affected, with Heathrow sitting well above the average at 47 per cent. 

New research finds that 38% of all UK departures disrupted near the holidays - with Heathrow averaging 47%

Of the 9,521 flights departing from Heathrow over last year's festive season, 4,409 were delayed and 63 were cancelled due to high winds and rain.

This new research comes from flightright.co.uk, a consumer portal for air passenger compensation on delayed, cancelled or overbooked flights.

And the UK's next largest airport did not fare much better.

Over 45 per cent of departures were affected at Gatwick Airport, while Bristol, Newcastle and Manchester rounded up the top five.

The UK's second largest airport, Gatwick, does not fare much better - 45% of all flights were affected last year

The silver lining? London Stansted does fairly well with on-time departures with only 27% delayed

For those flying out of the capital, there is some good news, however: London Stansted fared better than average, with just 27 per cent of departures delayed or cancelled.

Flight departures from December 20, 2013, through January 5, 2014, were analysed by the company and the top 10 worst UK airports were identified.  

1. London Heathrow - 47%

2. London Gatwick - 45%

3. Bristol - 37%

4. Newcastle - 36%

5. Manchester - 36%

6. Glasgow GLA - 35%

7. Southampton - 33%

8. Cardiff - 32%

9. Edinburgh - 31%

10. Liverpool - 31%

And for anyone who was caught up last Christmas, there may be a silver lining. 

Marek Janetzke, Managing Director of flightright, said: 'The Christmas and New Year holiday remains a peak time for air travel in the UK, and with the unpredictable winter weather, delays and cancellations are common. 

Looking for a distraction during your delay? Thankfully there are plenty of shops in London Heathrow

'Unfortunately, most passengers still do not know about their rights as airlines frequently leave them without information or don’t tell them that they are entitled to compensation or support. Airlines may be obliged to provide snacks, refreshments, telephone calls (or other means of communication), or hotel accommodation – even if they are not responsible for the issue.

'It only takes a three hour delay to be eligible for compensation of around £200.

'Potential compensation can reach up to £475 per passenger depending on the flight distance and delay time. 

'UK passengers have up to six years to make a claim compensation so it’s not too late to claim for flight delays over last Christmas.'
