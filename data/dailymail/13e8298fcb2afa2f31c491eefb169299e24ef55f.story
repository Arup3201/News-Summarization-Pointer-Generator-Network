A contestant in a Brazilian beauty pageant has allegedly confessed to plotting the murder of the rival who beat her in the competition.

The winner of the glamour competition in Cariacica, south-east Brazil, was to star in the music video of a well-known local band.

Dark-haired Alini Oliveira, 21, beat Adayane Matias, 20, to first place in the final round of the contest.

But she was shot dead in a hotel garden on September 21, just hours before the filming of the video was due to take place.

The gunman was allegedly Deivid 
Correa, who later turned out to be the boyfriend of Matias, the woman 
who came second in the competition.

Matias and her dance partner 
Juliermeson Baston, 20, later confessed to planning the murder, 
according to police chief Adroaldo Lopes.

He told Brazil’s Gazeta TV channel: 'They thought that Alini had robbed them of something that was rightfully theirs.

'Adayane became depressed and convinced her boyfriend to kill Alini to prove that he loved her.

'She believed that once she was out of the way she would be called up to replace her.’

Following the murder Baston is alleged
to have sent a text message to Matias saying 'now you can have some ham
with your breakfast' - 'ham' being Brazilian slang for 'dead body'.

In an interview with the Globo TV 
station, Baston said he and Matias, who danced together as a duo, believed that
if she won a place on the music video it might lead to the break they 
always dreamed of.

Confessing to the murder, he said: 'It
was a moment of desperation. We wanted recognition as dancers. Our 
attempts at making it big never came to anything.

'So Adayane came to a 
consensus with her boyfriend. She told him she would be happy if he did 
this for her, so he did what he did.'

Mr Lopes said that Matias 
and Baston ordered the death of their rival after reading posts on Oliveira's Facebook page about the video shoot.

According to Mr Lopes,
Correa implicated Matias and Baston in the crime after hearing that 
Matias had claimed their relationship was over.

He said: 'There were clear contradictions in the statements made by all three.

'In a new statement, 
Correa told us that his girlfriend didn't only know about the murder, 
but also planned the crime with the help of her dance partner.'

The trio are alleged to have planned 
three attempts at killing the model, including opening fire on a bus she
would have been travelling in to the video shoot, but Correa complained
innocent people would also have died.

Before shooting her twice in the back 
from a motorbike in the hotel garden, Correa is believed to have tried 
to find Oliveira at her house and at the gym where she worked out.

Correa, Matias and Bastos have all been charged with first-degree murder.
