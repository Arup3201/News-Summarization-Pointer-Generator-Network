These may look like scenes from a movie set in ancient Rome, but this is actually the Kirkpinar oil wrestling championships in modern-day Turkey.

Wearing only leather trousers and smeared with olive oil, these athletes about to competing in the oldest sports competition in the world.

The first competition took place near Erdine in 1362, when it was the capital of the Ottoman Empire, with most of the competitors being soldiers.

Thousands of fighters gather every year in Erdine, Turkey, to take part in the annual Kirpinar oil wrestling festival which has been taking place since 1362

Around 1,000 fighters, both boys and men, take part in the competition over three days in 12 categories ranked by height rather than weight

Bouts used to last for days before being decided, but are now limited to 40 minutes with 15 minutes of overtime if a winner is still to be decided

In Kirkpinar a fight is won when one competitor lifts another above his head, or pins the other man to the floor, or when one of the wrestlers collapses

Today both boys and men of any nationality are allowed to take part in the annual competition, and are trained in the art of oil wrestling by a master - much like martial artists in Asia.

The fighters - or Pehlivan as they are known - as supposed to uphold the best of Turkish values, symbolising generosity, honesty, respectfulness and adherence to traditions and customs.

While oil wrestling existed as far back as the ancient Egyptians, Kirkpinar is the oldest sanctioned competition still to be running - and holds the Guinness World Record for the longest running sporting event.

Kirkpinar wrestlers, or Pehlivan as they are known, train for years for the event under a master - similar to martial artists in Asia

Fighters are allowed to keep the golden belt permanently only if they win three events in a row, which is rare. The last time it happened was 16 years ago

Matches happen simultaneously in a giant grass arena outside of Erdine, the Sarayiçi Stadium, where the competition has been held for centuries

Both boys and men are allowed to compete for the event's prize, the golden belt, which they then get to keep until the following year

The festival begins as the golden belt, 
the prize for the winner, is paraded through the town to the Selimiye 
Mosque where prayers are said before it is taken to Mens Field for the 
competition.

Thousands of wrestlers, or Pehlivan, don traditional kispet trousers, made of either water buffalo or cow leather, before the master of ceremonies announces their names and talents, all in verse.

The men then compete in 12 different categories, classed by height rather than by weight, across three days in order to be named Chief Pehlivan.

Before each bout the men smear themselves with olive oil with hundreds of barrels of the slippery liquid being used during the festivities

The men compete nude except for a traditional kispet trousers - leather garments that used to be made from water buffalo but these days they are more commonly made from cow leather

Each of the wrestlers are introduced by the master of ceremonies who recites their names and abilities in verse before the competition begins

Kirkpinar, first fought in 1362, holds the record for the longest running sports competition in the world (pictured, a fighter washes himself down after a bout)

Matches are held simultaneously on the 
open grassy field of Sarayiçi Stadium. The islet of Sarayiçi, which 
translates to 'Inner Palace,' used to be the Sultan's summer palace and 
was once the private hunting reserve of the Ottoman sultans.

A bout is decided when a fighter either 
manages to pin another man to the ground, or manages to lift them up 
over their shoulders, or when one of the fighters collapses.

While fights could previously go on for days until a winner was decided, there is now a 40-minute time limit, with a winner determined by 15 minutes of overtime if there is no clear victor in that time.

Around 1,000 fighters of all ages, nationalities and builds take part in the competition to be named Chief Pehlivan

Boys to men: A group of young oil wrestlers watch their fellow competitors fight from behind a wire fence in Turkey

Getting clean: Some of the youngest competitors take a shower to wash off the olive oil poured over them during wrestling matches in Turkey

Man's game: Fighters are allowed to join the wrestling at a young age, with categories ranked on height. They are then trained by a master to improve their wrestling skills

The winner 
is awarded the golden belt which they get to keep until the following 
year when it is passed over to the next champion.

A
 wrestler who manages to retain the title can keep the belt permanently,
 with another one made for the following year, but this is extremely 
rare. The last fighter to keep a belt was Ahmet Tasci, who won his final
 competition 16 years ago.

Rather than modern synthetic oil, the Pehlivan smear themselves with natural olive oil, with over 100 drums of the liquid used during the festival.
