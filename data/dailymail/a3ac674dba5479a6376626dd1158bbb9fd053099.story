Professional longboard surfer Harley Ingleby shot amazing footage from inside the barrel of a wave

However he did have to duck for cover a few times and surf the waves in a crouch position as the enormous wave closed in on him.

The footage was shot using a GoPro camera mounted on the tail of his longboard, and said the surfing session was up there with the best he'd ever had.

'It was definitely a special day where a lot of factors all came in to line.'

'I'm just stoked to have been able to share probably the best longboard session of my life,' Ingleby admitted.

At times, Ingleby had to crouch low down in the wave to avoid being knocked off his board

The surfing pro said the way he chose to shoot the footage was a little risky but it certainly paid off.

'I've been using a GoPro since the HD Hero was released in 2010 but this was the first time I have successfully captured this many keeper clips in one surf.

'I personally think this is the most immersive point of view when shooting but tail mounting a GoPro has its difficulties like water splashing the lens or whether to wear a legrope or not.

'Obviously I chose not to which I ran a high risk of losing my board up the reef,' he said.

Ingleby admitted it was very rewarding to see the final product, and described the video as one of his finest achievements.

'The final edit definitely brought a huge smile to my face.

'I have captured some really nice photos in the past and GoPro even used one on a billboard in Times Square, New York for a summer promo.

'But I feel this has been my best achievement so far.'

The professional longboard surfer has a lot of experience on the waves, and finished third during his debut in the ASP World Tour in 2006.
