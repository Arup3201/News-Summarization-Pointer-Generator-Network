Premier League star Gael Clichy claims he was racially abused by a fan who threw a banana onto the pitch during a match.

A police probe is to be launched into Sunday's incident during Manchester City's friendly showdown at Limerick FC.

After his side’s 4-0 win at Thomond Park, an angry Clichy vented his frustration on micro-blogging site Twitter.

He said: 'How sad to see "bananas thrown on the pitch" tonight... Knowing people around the world need food. #nowordsforthis.'

The glamour friendly with the Premier League champions was a major coup for the First Division side.

More than 20,000 fans turning up to see some major stars of world soccer. But the incident involving French international left-back Clichy blighted the tie. Limerick FC has pledged to identify the person involved.

In a statement, the club said: 'Limerick FC officials met with Thomond Park officials and local gardaí this afternoon, to continue attempts to identify a person that threw an offensive object onto the playing field during the friendly game on Sunday night, August 5.

'An incident of this nature is completely unacceptable and is fully condemned by Limerick FC and Thomond Park.

'CCTV footage is still being analysed and when the offending party is identified appropriate action will be taken.

'It is deeply upsetting that the actions of one individual have soured the experience for all those in attendance.'

An official Garda investigation has not yet begun as they require someone to make a formal complaint before they can open a probe.

However, sources claim gardaí are confident of identifying the person involved and that Limerick FC will then submit a formal complaint if the culprit's identity is revealed.

Last night, a spokesman for Manchester City said that they did not want to comment on the incident.

The club has also not made an  
official complaint, nor has Clichy. However, a source within the club 
said that they were satisfied with how Limerick FC was dealing with the 
matter.

Ged Grebby, chief executive of Show Racism the Red Card, was both surprised and disappointed to hear of the allegations.

He said: 'The fact it's coming in in friendly games is worrying, and in different countries.

'Ireland actually has a good 
reputation. We have a Show Racism the Red Card campaign in Ireland which
 does a lot of good work, and it's similar in Holland.

'The Dutch and Irish fans have good 
very good reputations, and they kept those reputations intact throughout
 the Euros, so these incidents are quite surprising.'

Show Racism the Red card calls for bans of three to five years for spectators found guilty of racially-motivated offences.

The source said: 'We have every confidence that they will take the right steps. They've been excellent in the way they've handled it.'

Yesterday, there was fury in the city at the incident and that negative publicity had made headlines across the world.

Former mayor of Limerick, Joe Leddin, said: 'I'm disappointed. It's very regretful but I’d like to think, if it's true, it's a one-off. I don't recall any incident like it before.

'It leaves a sour taste in the mouth of the player and probably the Manchester City team.' Sunday's match was expected to generate €6million for the mid-west economy.

During the match Edin Dzeko scored twice as Roberto Mancini's side cruised to victory.

Captain for the day Samir Nasri got the game off to a lively start when a high clearance from the French midfielder evaded the entire Limerick back line, almost putting out-of-favour Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz through on an open goal.

City broke the deadlock on the half hour when a weaving run from James Milner created space for the England international to roll the ball into the path of Dzeko, who bundled home from close range.

The visitors doubled their lead on 42 minutes when defender Dedryck Boyata received the ball from youngster Denis Suarez and calmly slotted home.

And Dzeko found himself clear of the Limerick defence just a minute later, firing low and hard to put the Premier League champions 3-0 up.

The second half was played out at a more steady pace, only reigniting on 78 minutes when 21-year-old Italian midfielder Luca Scapuzzi fired home a fourth for City.

Limerick began to press as the game wore on but were unable to find a way through a solid defence. Manchester City play Chelsea in the Community Shield clash this weekend.
