There is not much that Carmelo Anthony hasn’t seen or done, but meeting the prince was still on his ‘to do’ list.

The New York Knicks star paid a visit to St James’s Palace on Wednesday afternoon for a royal appointment, where he was greeted by Prince Harry.

‘I never thought I would meet the prince,’ Anthony said. ‘I didn’t know what to expect, so just to see us walking into the room together and the kids laughing and joking, it was just a warm welcome from him to me.’

Anthony joined Prince Harry at a reception for the Core Coach programme, an apprentice scheme run for jobless young people by the Royal Foundation.

‘It was a beautiful moment teaming up and representing the Royal Foundation. It was just a spectacular day for me to be around the kids and the prince as well.’

‘When you come over here to London you can feel the royalty and the energy and the vibe. I’m a big fan of London. I’ve had a lot of memories and experiences here so it’s always good to be back.’

Anthony’s London memories include being part of the USA team that won Olympic basketball gold in 2012, and also a Knicks victory over the Detroit Pistons in January 2013.

But this current trip might just top the lot for the free-scoring forward if he can overcome a knee problem that has kept him out of the Knicks’ last six games and guide them to victory over the Bucks on Thursday.

‘The injury is alright,’ Anthony said at the team’s practice session at the O2 on Wednesday. ‘I’m still looking forward to hopefully being out there tomorrow night. I have still got today and tomorrow before the game and it will be a game-time decision.’

Anthony is not sure, though, whether Prince Harry will be attending the game at the O2 Arena on Thursday.

The Knicks forward added: ‘He said he wants to and he will try. If not I understand, he is a busy man.’

When Milwaukee Bucks head coach Jason Kidd was asked about Carmelo’s meeting with the prince, he laughed: ‘That’s what the best players in the world do.’

Knicks head coach Derek Fisher, meanwhile, says he is not jealous of Anthony’s excursions.

He said: ‘You should only be frustrated if you expected to get an invite but didn’t. I didn’t get an invite so I’m not frustrated at all.’

Fisher remains optimistic about Anthony being able to play against the Bucks on Thursday, but doesn’t want to push his star player into a return too soon.

Fisher said: ‘We practiced today and he would love to be able to play tomorrow, but we don’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves. He did good in practice yesterday, did more today and will have a shoot-around in the morning and we will see how he goes.’
