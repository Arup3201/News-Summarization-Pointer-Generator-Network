CBS 2's Brad Edwards reports the raid was part of a year-long, national investigation and that both outlets are owned by Donald Green. 

Mr Green is licensed as a funeral director and embalmer since 1979.

The news outlet reports the investigation that started in Detroit where it was discovered that thousands of body parts were kept on ice instead of being embalmed, allegedly ready for the black market.

In January last year, FBI agents in Phoenix also raided the Biological Resource Center of Arizona - agents were reportedly looking into the alleged misuse of bodies donated for medical research.

Joan Hyde, a spokeswoman for the FBI field office in Chicago told the Chicago Tribune, the FBI as well as agents with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were involved.

David Porter, an FBI special agent in Detroit, said the search warrants were sought by his office, but neither he nor Hyde would comment on the nature of the ongoing criminal investigation.
