A British holidaymaker has discovered a type of spider that bears a striking resemblance to the creepy character Jack Skellington.

Debbie Hall, from Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire, spotted the spooky-looking bug while she was visiting the Turrialba area of Costa Rica.

Both spiders and living skeletons are likely to give you a fright on their own, but a mish-mash of the Nightmare Before Christmas character an eight-legged insect makes for one scary-looking creepy-crawly.

The white markings on the spider's 
predominantly black body make its appearance very much like the 
protagonist in Tim Burton's 1993 movie.

The spooky critter: The spider's markings might be to make it look more menacing that it actually is, in order for it to ward off attackers or predators

A similar case, perhaps terrifying in a different way, is when a photographer in India was left speechless after he spotted the face of Hitler on the back of a common stink bug.

The snapper was getting some pictures of the local wildlife in his back garden when he spotted the bug had an incredibly peculiar pattern resembling the German ex-dictator.

Subbu Sullia, 29, from Bangalore, India noticed almost straight away that the markings on the insect's back resembled the hair line and tiny mustache that made German leader's face so recognisable.

He kept trying to get the bugs best side, but was unable to capture it's most fÃ¼hrer-like pose because it kept running away.
