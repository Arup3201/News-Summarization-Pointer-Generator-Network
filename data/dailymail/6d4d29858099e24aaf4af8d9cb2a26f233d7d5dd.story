David de Gea is aware of rumours linking him with a move to Real Madrid but insists he feels 'very loved' by Manchester United. 

The goalkeeper, who suffered a dislocated finger when training with Spain last week and is unlikely to be available for the Premier League clash at Arsenal, is seen at Real Madrid as a natural heir to club captain Iker Casillas.

He told La Sexta on Monday morning: ‘It is difficult to say whether a bid will be made by Real, because of all the rumours that appear in the press.

‘In Manchester I feel wanted. If you took seriously what is written about you, you'd almost think you're going to a thousand clubs.

‘So the best you can do is pay attention to where you are. ‘I feel very loved by Man United.’

De Gea is United's only ever-present this season, but his injury means he is set to miss the tea-time showdown at the Emirates on Saturday.

Anders Lindegaard, who has not played for United since April, is expected to step up and deputise.

It was originally suggested that  De Gea was going to be out for four weeks, however Sportsmail understands he could be back before then.

Victor Valdes tweeted last week that he is 'almost ready' to return but medical staff believe he still has work to do before United consider registering him to play.

The former Barcelona keeper is a free agent so can sign any time although they would have to apply for permission to include the player in their Premier League squad should they want to play him before January. 

United only named 24 senior players in their squad so have room to bring in Valdes.
