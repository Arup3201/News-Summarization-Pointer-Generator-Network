Abducted: Moira Anderson went missing in 1957 and is thought to have been murdered by rapist Alexander Gartshore

She has been missing, presumed murdered, for 56 years, but yesterday the search for schoolgirl Moira Anderson reached what is certain to be its final destination.

In a graveyard a short distance from the 11-year-old's former home, police erected protective tents around a family lair where eight bodies are known to be buried.

As officers prepare to begin exhuming the bodies, they may learn whether there is a ninth set of remains buried in the Upton family plot in Old Monkland Cemetery, Coatbridge, Lanarkshire.

If an extra body is found, forensic tests will establish if it is that of Moira, who would have been 67 if she had lived. If nothing untoward is uncovered, then her disappearance will continue to haunt her family and hometown forever.

The youngster is believed to have been abducted and murdered by Alexander Gartshore, who was driving the bus that Moira took as she set off to a local shop in Coatbridge on February 23, 1957.

Gartshore, a known sex offender, was jailed for rape shortly after Moira's disappearance but he did not figure in the initial police inquiry. 

He died in 2006 shortly after telling his daughter Sandra Brown that Moira had haunted him all his life. 

Mrs Brown, 63, has believed for decades that her father was Moira's killer and it was she who identified the Upton family lair as the most likely burial spot. 

Last month, Sheriff Frank Pieri granted a petition brought by Moira's sisters Janet Hart and  Marjory Muir to allow exhumation after relatives of those buried in the lair raised no objections. 

Digging is expected to begin shortly 
after dawn under a team led by forensic anthropologist Professor 
Sue Black of Dundee University.

The exhumation process may last several days. It
has been suggested that Gartshore secreted Moira's body into the lair 
in the weeks following her death when the grave was opened for the 
burial of Sinclair Upton, who died aged 80.

It has emerged that Gartshore once told a colleague that Mr Upton had done him 'a big favour'. Mrs Brown, who has extensively researched the case, said: 'I believe in my heart we'll find her.

'The evidence we have only points in 
that direction. I pray for a successful conclusion because, whatever 
happens, this will be the last act. There is no other avenue to go 
down.'

Mrs Hart, 69, who lives in Australia, said: 'Our mother and father went to their graves never knowing  what happened to Moira.

'My sister and I are growing old. We don't want to suffer the same fate. We'll be by our phones, praying for news.'
