NBC Sports has sparked outrage for airing an NRA-sponsored show in which the host kills an elephant by shooting it in the face.

In a highlighted reel from this week's episode of 'Under Wild Skies,' host Tony Makris - who is a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association - is filmed hunting an elephant in Botswana with a guide. 

Makris and the guide hide behind brush about 20 feet away from the animal and talk about shooting it in the face, before Makris fires a couple shots.

Makris explains how he was aiming for the elephant's face when he fired several shots at the animal

Makris, pictured, hits the animal - but does not kill it. The elephant shrieks in pain and runs off, but doesn't get far enough away to escape its fate.

'I'm bent over literally shootin' through a hole in the trees,' he says to the guide, just before firing the two shots. 

He hits the animal, but does not kill it. The elephant cries out in pain and runs off, but doesn't get far enough away to escape its fate. 

Makris fires another shot and the animal lets out a long, loud groan. Then Makris begins chuckling.

'Somebody got a little cheeky there,' he says breathlessly, apparently referring to the elephant's struggle to stay alive. 

'Can we shoot some birds this afternoon, or...?' he adds.

In the next shot, Makris and the hunting guide are standing next to the lifeless elephant.

'You snuck us right in this guy's 
bedroom,' Makris says, marveling at his work. 'I mean look at this, this
is where he hangs out!'

'He didn't know we were here, but what a hunt!' Afterwards, the men celebrate by drinking champagne.

Deadspin, which first reported on the show, points out that a ban on hunting elephants is set to go into effect in Botswana in 2014.

Some NBC Sports viewers are now calling on the network to cancel the show.

Twitter user Mike Potter called NBC's airing of the show 'outrageous, obscene, unforgivable and just plain wrong.'

Another user added: 'Shame on you for "Under Wild Skies." Elephants are endangered and this is NOT a sport. I will no longer watch NBC Sports.'

Makris is the chairman of Mercury Group, a public relations agency that is largely responsible for transforming the NRA from a sportsman's group into one of Washington's most powerful lobbying organizations

On Facebook, David Dunaway posted to the 'Under Wild Skies' page, 'Dear NBC Sports: This is a huge mistake. I am pretty disgusted that you would show elephant hunting.'

After the kill, the men celebrated by drinking champagne

User Alex Kenney tweeted, 'You aired an elephant being shot in the face?...for sport? If I find out this 'Under Wild Skies' show isn't cancelled GOODBYE [NBC Sports Network].'

On Facebook, David Dunaway posted to the 'Under Wild Skies' page, 'Dear NBC Sports: This is a huge mistake. I am pretty disgusted that you would show elephant hunting. Your brand is terribly damaded by this.'

Andrew Schaefer added: 'How anyone could glorify that type of killing is beyond me, let alone televise it when children are watching? We couldn't change the channel fast enough.'

Makris is the chairman of Mercury Group, a public relations agency that is largely responsible for transforming the NRA from a sportsman's group into one of Washington's most powerful lobbying organizations, according to a February 2013 article in the Washington Post.
