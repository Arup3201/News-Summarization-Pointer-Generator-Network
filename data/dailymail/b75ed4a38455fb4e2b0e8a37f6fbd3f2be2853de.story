Cristiano Ronaldo will have yet another record in his sights after moving up to sixth in the all-time list of top scorers in the big five leagues on Sunday.

Ronaldo's penalty in Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat by Valencia at the Mestalla  - which brought an end to their 22-game winning run - was his 28th La Liga goal this season.

And it was also his 287th goal in the Spanish and English leagues combined, which took him level with Gordon Hodgson in sixth position in the table of scorers across Europe's biggest leagues, which also includes the Bundesliga in Germany, Italy's Serie A and the French top flight, Ligue 1.

Hodgson, who played for both South Africa and England, scored 287 league goals during his spells with Liverpool, Aston Villa and Leeds United from 1926-1939.

Next in sight for 29-year-old Ronaldo is Delio Onnis, an Argentine born in Italy, who scored 299 goals in France from 1971-1986.

Top of the table is English legend Jimmy Greaves, who scored 366 goals between 1957 and 1971 - 357 in England and nine during his time in Italy.

Greaves finished just one goal ahead of Germany's Gerd Muller, who hit the back of the net 365 times for Bayern Munich from 1965-1979.

England's Steve Bloomer and Dixie Dean take up the fourth and fifth positions respectively.

In all, there are five English players in the top 10 with Alan Shearer sitting in eighth, having scored 283 league goals for Southampton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United from 1988-2006.

Ronaldo is 30 goals ahead of rival Lionel Messi, with the Barcelona 27-year-old scoring 257 goals in the league for the Catalan club since 2004.

Ronaldo's next opportunity to further add to his total will come on Saturday when Real Madrid host Espanyol at the Santiago Bernabeu. 

1. Jimmy Greaves (England)

Jimmy Greaves started his career at Chelsea in 1957 but it was his nine-year spell at Tottenham Hotspur from 1961 which proved to be his most successful as he became the White Hart Lane club's highest ever goalscorer. Greaves also spent six months with AC Milan in 1961 and played for West Ham from 1970-1971.

2. Gerd Muller (Germany)

Gerd Muller is the greatest German striker ever, scoring 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga games during his 15 years at Bayern Munich from 1964-1979. His international record for West Germany was phenomenal, scoring 68 goals in 62 appearances.

3. Steve Bloomer (England)

Steve Bloomer is regarded as Derby County's greatest ever player. The club anthem is called Steve Bloomer's Watchin' and he has a bronze statue situated next to the team dugout at Pride Park. He started playing with the Rams in 1892, moved to Middlesbrough in 1906 for four years before returning to Derby to end his career there.
