Ella Richards, the 18-year-old granddaughter of Rolling Stones guitar hero Keith Richards, has made her New York Fashion Week debut.

The slinky, long-necked blonde, who is signed to Wilhelmina models, sashayed down the runway for yesterday's Richard Chai show at the Lincoln Center, looking very much at home.

And well she should, given her impressive lineage. Ella's father Marlon Richards, son of Keith, is a photographer and graphic artist, and her mother is Lucie de la Falaise; a former model and niece of legendary Yves Saint Laurent muse Loulou de la Falaise.

Debut: 18-year-old Ella Richards, who is signed with Storm, made her first steps onto the New York Fashion Week circuit yesterday when she appeared in the Richard Chai show at the Lincoln Center 

Ella is based in London, having been educated at an English boarding school. The 5ft 9in model has slowly been creeping into the fashion spotlight over the last year, having recently appeared in the Tom Ford fall/winter 2014 campaign.

In the past, Ella has declared her 'family members' as being her style icons, with a fondness for the bohemian aesthetic. Her father, born to two then-heroin addicted parents; Keith and Anita Pallenberg, was raised on the Rolling Stones tour bus.

Her mother Lucie graced multiple Vogue covers in 90s, and their inner circle of close family and friends include Johnny Depp, Liv Tyler, and cousins Theodora and Alexandra Richards.

Ella - who was a bridesmaid at Kate Moss' 2011 wedding, and has said she often inherits the supermodel's wardrobe cast-offs - was seemingly predestined to charge off down this route.

When asked by Teen Vogue at the age of 15 whether she might consider a career as a model, Ella said: 'I haven't really thought about it.

'It could be cool because having your hair and make-up done is fun, and all of the traveling would be amazing.'

Mission accomplished. Ella is scheduled to walk in the upcoming EDUN show next week.
