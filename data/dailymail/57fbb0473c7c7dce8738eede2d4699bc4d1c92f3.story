Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are exerting ‘pressure’ on their Irish players around Republic of Ireland games and feels a ‘clear the air’ summit with manager Roberto Martinez is required.

The Irish No 2 acknowledges Martinez has a duty to his club but feels ‘balance’ is needed regarding the international availability of James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman and Darron Gibson for the remainder of the Euro 2016 campaign.

McCarthy has missed the last three Euro 2016 qualifiers, including Friday’s 1-0 loss to Scotland, but is expected to be fit for Everton’s game against West Ham on Saturday.

It follows the events of last month where McCarthy and Coleman both played for their club, only four days after missing the Euro qualifier against world champions Germany.

‘I worry that he (McCarthy) is under lots of pressure, particularly from Everton’s point of view,’ said Keane on Sunday.

‘Because every time there is an international match it does seem to be Seamus (Coleman) and James (McCarthy) under lots of pressure. They’re turning up or they mightn’t turn up, or they’re struggling,’ he observed.

‘You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk, that type of thing.

‘So when they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception, “Praise the Lord, it’s a miracle.”

With Ireland’s Euro fate hinging on strong home form in the six qualifiers to come in 2015, Keane feels the point should be made to Martinez, in person, how important his players are to their country.

‘There has to be, I think, some sort of sit-down conversation and say, “Listen, I think Martin’s been more than good enough here, particularly the friendlies but these are big qualifying matches now,” said Keane.

‘Roberto Martinez has to look after his club and he is probably thinking they have European games.

‘Roberto, I don’t think, has ever played senior level at international level and maybe he doesn’t appreciate how big it is for us and how big the games are for us,’ he added.

Keane can still see where Martinez is coming from, just as Alex Ferguson was often unenthusiastic about Keane playing for Ireland, especially friendlies.

‘We talk about the manager here and the manager there but there’s a player in between all that, and I can speak from experience, he’s under lots of pressure too,’ said Keane.

‘There is a guarantee that when the player turns up (for internationals) they are getting phone calls left, right and centre from their 15 physios at the club.’

‘You’re also hoping the player can make the decision and say, ‘I’ll give it a go’ or whatever it might be,’ he said.

McCarthy missed the Scotland game despite an all-clear scan on his hamstring, which prompted speculation that his heart wasn’t up for a Glasgow return.

‘Some times it may be up to the player to say, “Listen, I’m going to try and train, whatever my club manager says or whatever the doctor says or whatever the scan says” because you do know your own body,’ observed Keane.

‘Whatever way you look at it, James didn’t train all week – it’s not as if he went out and had a jog, it’s not as if he’s joined in a little bit of possession. So that was a difficult one.’

Asked if McCarthy was afraid of being jeered in his native Glasgow, Keane said: ‘Nah, I don’t think so.’

‘They (McCarthy and Aiden McGeady) declared for Ireland, they are Irish and are proud to be involved with us. I don’t think that (jeering) was an issue.’

If Martinez is protective of his players, he may have fair reason after Gibson sustained serious knee damage on Irish duty 13 months ago, which kept him out for almost a year.
