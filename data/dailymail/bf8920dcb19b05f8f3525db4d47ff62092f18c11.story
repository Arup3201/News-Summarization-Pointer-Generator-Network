An unidentified male New York Jets fan punched a woman in the face in a post-game brawl on Sunday.

The punch-up began after the Jets bested the New England Patriots 30-27 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

A man videoing the fight says the fights started with two females in the stands.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Dragged away: The man in the number 80 green jersey is already being removed from the brawl by another man

Angry: This blonde woman seen in the red and white jersey advances towards the Jets fan

Hit: The blonde woman reels back as she is punched in the face by the large man

It then 'moved out to where I shot the video. Beer was thrown and clothing over the balcony. Security went after the guy. Didn't see what happened after that,' the witness who shot the video told Deadspin.

The video shows a large man wearing camouflage shorts and a Wayne Chrebet jersey being hauled away from the crowd by another man.

A blond woman, who according to CBS was a Patriots fan, advances towards him then reeling back as she is punched squarely in the nose.

The woman seems relatively unperturbed for someone who has just been punched by a man twice her size. 

Hard hit: The force of the punch sends her staggering several feet backward

Recovering: The woman can be seen to the right of this frame rubbing her face with her arm

She nonchalantly wipes her nose with her arm as the man who punched her is pulled away.

It's unclear what started the brawl, but a new rule that helped the Jets clinch the victory may have had something to do with it.

According to Newsday, the new rule stipulates that a player may not push a teammate into the opponent's formation.

The rule was brought to bear when Patriot Chris Jones pushed his teammate Will Svitek forward in an attempt to block the kick. 

After Jones was penalized, the Jets got 15 yards closer and Nick Folk made a 42-yeard game-winning kick

A Jets team spokesperson released a statement saying, 'We
 are aware of the situation, and we do not tolerate that behavior. 
Parties involved were detained, and this matter is now in the hands of 
the New Jersey State Police.'
