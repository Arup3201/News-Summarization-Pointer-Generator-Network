It was certainly due. For Samir Nasri, for Manchester City. Nasri hadn’t scored all season; they had looked a shadow of a team who should be making light work of the Champions League group stage by now.

And then, on the hour, in the Stadio Olimpico, a plan came together. For Nasri, a goal at last. For City, a performance that lived up to the hype. They were men down here, and good men, too — Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Vincent Kompany, David Silva until midway through the second half.

Yet they came through. They won. CSKA Moscow lost, and a place in Monday’s last-16 draw was the prize. By God, they made hard work of it — but this, coupled with the magnificent finale against Bayern Munich, has changed the narrative around City in this tournament.

The next stage will be hard: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Porto, Borussia Dortmund and Monaco are their possible opponents in the second round, but a number of those clubs will be fearing City every bit as much as City are nervous around Spain’s big beasts.

It is feasible, after this, that a corner has been turned. City have every right to approach Europe with renewed confidence. They have taken their time, but this team are at last finding ways to win in the continent’s most inhospitable places.

Roma have not lost here this season in Serie A and were expecting to progress from Group E, in the slipstream of Bayern Munich. They had outplayed City in the away fixture even if the game ended in a draw. City’s depleted ranks made it a tall order for a team that has struggled even at full strength.

Yet, as strange as this may seem of a side with such experience, City came of age here. They scored — and that was essential, because Roma needed only a 0-0 draw if Moscow lost — and then they held on, despite a fierce onslaught.

Pablo Zabaleta claimed the second goal with four minutes left, and even the most nervous traveller could breathe easy after that. City ended the game in rare nick, knocking the ball about like Champions League aristocracy.

And what a peach of a goal made that possible. Nasri had not scored since the final day of last season. He was precisely the type of player who needed to step up to the plate with Aguero absent, and most certainly he did.

Credit James Milner with a fine decoy run which opened the space for the shot, but Nasri’s finish was superb. A right-foot blast from just outside the area, deviating slightly and striking the inside of goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis’s near post, nestling in the net. Cue a frantic finish in front of a riotous Roman assembly.

In many ways, this was where City came into their own. True, due to UEFA’s methods of separating tied teams at the group stage, after Nasri’s intervention Roma needed to score twice to progress, but this was City shorn of their inspirational captain Kompany.

Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala are nothing if not accident-prone. Yet, under intense pressure, they stood tall.

As did Joe Hart. Shortly before Nasri’s goal, he had made a fine diving save from Miralem Pjanic and immediately after he kept out Radja Nainggolan in similar fashion. His best, though, came from a header by Kostas Manolas.

Hart flung himself to the left and somehow, with his fingertips, prised it on to a post.

Demichelis cleared off the line, too, but it was England’s goalkeeper who earned man of the match plaudits in the aftermath. Manuel Pellegrini has not always shown the greatest faith in him, but on occasions like this his quality shines through. He is head and shoulders the best goalkeeper in the country. No pun intended.

City, as England’s champions, should be setting standards, but are not. In Europe this season they have on occasions been an embarrassment. The defeat at home by CSKA Moscow was a new low.

Yet this is a forgiving competition, the group stage offering many second chances, and fair play to City for taking theirs. They should have been long gone. They looked it that night against Moscow, and again as Bayern Munich danced around them in the previous match. Yet Aguero’s hat-trick surprised us all on that occasion, and a collective effort did the trick here.

City having been derided as a one-man team, it was perhaps understandable that Nasri seized on that aspect of the victory in his interviews. Stronger together, was his message. On this evidence it was impossible to deny.

It definitely helped that City knew Moscow were losing at half-time. Provided that result was maintained, it made the second half a straight shoot-out between the teams here and perhaps the conservative Italians were startled by City’s ambition.

They were disciplined, yet adventurous, as if with nothing to lose. Having been pronounced dead after the Moscow defeat, they were an almost supernatural presence in this competition: impossible to kill twice.

Of course, had Jose Holebas scored after five minutes it could have been very different. Picked out by a long pass on the right of the six-yard box, he cut inside, improved his angle and hit a low shot that was met by Hart’s first good save of the night.

Moments later, Nainggolan struck a cross from the left that should have caused further problems — but Roma rarely got in behind City after that.

Gervinho did his best to put his inconsistency at Arsenal behind him, and he attacked down the right flank after 21 minutes, firing a low effort past Hart that flew just wide of the far post — but not until City were ahead did Roma threaten consistently again.

Edin Dzeko had a few early chances, mostly set up by Jesus Navas, and should have done more with a glancing header and a close- range shot that he skied over the crossbar.

Yet as Roma went in search of a way back, it was a defender, Zabaleta, who made sure of victory. He pounced on a pass from Nasri and finished low past De Sanctis.

It was a welcome sight — much like the return of Silva, introduced for Navas after 67 minutes — and it was a happy blue contingent who spilled out into the mild night.

This is a team on the up, despite its handicaps. This may be as good as it has been for City in Europe; but it might not be as good as it gets.
