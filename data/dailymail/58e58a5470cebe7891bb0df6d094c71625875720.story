Probe: Police officers investigating the horrific murders of a British family in the Alps believe they were shot by a serial killer with a hatred of tourists, it has emerged. One of the victims, Saad al-Hilli, is pictured

Police officers investigating the horrific murders of a British family in the Alps believe they were shot by a serial killer with a hatred of tourists, it has emerged.

The motive behind the horrific killings of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and mother-in-law Suhaila Iqbal while on a camping holiday in the south of France have left detectives baffled.

But French detectives say they have now linked the murders of the British family with the mysterious death of another tourist in July.

Xavier Baligant, 29, was shot four times at a rest area near Nancy while he was heading home to Belgium following a camping trip. His two sons Jordan, 7, and Dylan, five, were sleeping in his car when their father was killed. They escaped unharmed.

The al-Hilli's were also on a camping trip in Annecy, France, when they were attacked.  

Police also believe the gun used in both attacks was very similar -  it is thought to have been used by the Swiss army before the First World War and is a collectors' item.

Mr al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old wife Iqbal, his 74-year-old mother-in-law and French cyclist Mr Mollier, 45, were killed when a lone gunman opened fire at an isolated lay-by close to the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy.

Mr al-Hilli's daughters Zainab and Zeena survived the shooting in September.

There was no DNA at the scene, but shell casings from the weapon suggest the gun used was an antique Luger.

Speaking earlier this week, French investigator Eric Maillaud said all lines of 
inquiry remain open.

He said investigators were looking for 'unbalanced 
people - capable of extreme violence'.

'Without doubt we are looking for someone who has killed before, someone who puts no value on human life,' he said.

He said police were looking for people who had access to guns, such as hunters, collectors or members of shooting clubs - in particular those with psychiatric problems.
