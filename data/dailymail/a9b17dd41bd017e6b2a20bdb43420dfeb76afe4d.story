A British schoolgirl has died two days before her seventh birthday after falling from a stairwell during a family holiday in Tenerife.

Heather Kennedy lost her fight for life yesterday morning - four days after being rushed to hospital with head injuries following the accident at her family's rented apartment on the Spanish island.

She had been in intensive care with multiple fractures to her skull since losing her footing as she ran to meet her cousins.

The accident happened at around 7pm last Friday at an apartment block in the popular resort of Playa de las Americas.

She was due to celebrate her seventh birthday tomorrow before flying back to Britain.

Her mother, Agnes, 50, from Chapelhall, Airdrie, raised the alarm after the youngster's uncle Joshua found her lying unconscious on the ground beside the apartment moments after her fall.

It is not clear exactly how the youngster fell. Initial reports suggested she lost her footing while going down the stairs, but it is now believed she plunged from a wall next to the staircase 
between the first and ground floors.

Police questioned the family after being called to hospital by doctors as a matter of routine but concluded Heather had died in a tragic accident.

A source close to the case said: 'Her family told the police she ran out of the flat to meet her cousins who were outside and her uncle saw her lying on the ground by the entrance to the apartment block after running out behind her.

'It looks as if she's fallen from a low wall by spiral stairs leading from one floor to another.

'Doctors called police as a matter of routine after they'd examined the child.

'The injuries she suffered are consistent with a fall from height.'

A spokesman for the National Police in Tenerife confirmed: 'This is being treated as a tragic accident.'

Heather was transferred to a hospital in the island capital Santa Cruz after doctors at a hospital near Playa de Las Americas discovered she had cracked her skull in four places.

She was kept in intensive care at Our Lady of Candelaria University Hospital over the weekend but lost her fight for life yesterday.

The family are thought to have stayed on the island to make arrangements to repatriate Heather's body.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have been notified of the death of a British national in Santa Cruz, Tenerife and we stand ready to provide consular assistance to the family.'
