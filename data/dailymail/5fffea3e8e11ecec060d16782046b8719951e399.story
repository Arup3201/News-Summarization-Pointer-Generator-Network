Stoke have inquired about taking the Manchester City winger Scott Sinclair on loan after Peter Odemwingie was carried off in Saturday's win 1-0 at the Etihad.

Sinclair is under contract at City until 2016 but has failed to make an impact since signing from Swansea two years ago and spent last season on loan at West Brom.

Stoke have also looked into the possibility of taking Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi back to the Britannia.

Assaidi was on loan with the Potters last season and could have made a permanent move there earlier this summer but failed to agree personal terms.
