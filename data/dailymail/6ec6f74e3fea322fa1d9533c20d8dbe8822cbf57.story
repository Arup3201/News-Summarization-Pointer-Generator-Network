Jose Mourinho risked the wrath of the Football Association after claiming the ‘campaign’ against his side is still going on and could cost Chelsea the Premier League title.

Mourinho was incensed after being held 1-1 at home by Burnley on Saturday, claiming a string of decisions by referee Martin Atkinson cost his side dearly, with Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic set to miss next Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham after being sent off after 69 minutes.

Mourinho felt Ashley Barnes should have been sent off for the challenge that prompted Matic to retaliate by pushing the Burnley striker over, and should also have seen red for an earlier push on Branislav Ivanovic. And Mourinho’s sense of injustice was not helped by two penalty claims that were ignored, when Michael Kightly handled an Ivanovic shot in the 33rd minute, and then when Burnley skipper Jason Shackell pushed Diego Costa to the ground shortly before half-time.

Chelsea's boss identified the minutes 30, 33, 43 and 69 and thinks they 'wrote the story of the game' in his post-match interview

Last month, Mourinho was fined £25,000 and warned about his future conduct after speaking in December about a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea, and was further incensed when Diego Costa received a three-match ban for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can soon afterwards.

So he chose his words carefully  and spoke cryptically about the incidents, outlining the minute that each perceived injustice happened rather than describing them or the players involved in detail.

He told Sky Sports: 'I think there are four moments of the game where you can write the story of the game. Minute 30, minute 33, minute 43 and minute 69.I repeat for you, I make it easy for you. Minute 30, 33, 43 and 69. The game had four moments and don't ask me more questions because I don't answer.'

In a separate interview with BBC Sport, Mourinho carried on refusing to comment on the match.  

'I just say that I believe in spite of some clear callers you guys are all honest people and professional people and I believe that sometimes the callers they can disturb a little bit the truth. But I truly believe that you are all honest people.' 

The tackle infuriated Matic and Mourinho but Barnes got away unpunished despite how high his studs are up the Serb's leg

'After these four moments I am surprised that we didn't lose all three points.

'I am in no mood to laugh.' 

The incidents in question are thought to be involve Barnes' tackles and two penalty appeals which were turned down.

The main talking point will be Matic's straight red card after 69 minutes.

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Verdict: Should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card for Barnes.

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. Verdict: Shocking tackle merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.

The Serbian midfielder was caught by a nasty challenge from the Burnley forward and reacted angrily by pushing him to the floor in front of the referee. 

When asked about the sending off the Chelsea boss simply responded. 

‘That was the minute 69 and it had a big relation with minute 30,’ said Mourinho.

‘Normally the player, if I can call him a player, was involved in minute 30 and normally by minute 31 he should be in the shower. No minute 69 if the person in charge does the things in the proper way in minute 30.’ 

When pushed on the matter the usually fiery Mourinho simply refused to comment.

He said: 'I can't do that because I'm punished when I refer to these situations. I don't want to be punished. 

Mourinho was clearly keen on avoiding another hefty fine after being fined £25,000 for comments claiming that there was a 'campaign to influence referees.'

The Chelsea boss made the comment after his side were denied a penalty after Cesc Fabregas was adjudged to have dived in the box in the 1-1 draw with Southampton on 28 December.

He told BBC Sport: 'The media, commentators, other managers are all doing it [putting pressure on referees].'

'There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don't know why there is this campaign and I do not care.

'Everybody knows it was a penalty.'

Barnes was also involved in another incident after catching goalscorer Branislav Ivanovic in the back with a high foot - which happened in one of the minutes Mourinho mentioned.  

The other minutes in questions are believed to be about the two penalty appeals Chelsea had waved away.

On 33 minutes, Ivanovic's shot struck Michael Kightly on the arm but Martin Atkinson said no.

Branislav Ivanovic screams in pain after being fouled by Barnes in the first half - which was an incident Mourinho mentioned 

Then just before half-time, Diego Costa was pushed over in the box by Jason Shackell but once again the referee refused to give it - much to the bemusement of the home side. 

When asked again Mourinho continued to keep his mouth closed.  

'I don't describe. To describe I have to use words that I cannot use. It's better we finish here. 

'You do want you want to do, you speak what you want to speak. You are not punished by that - I am. 

'I don't want to look silly in front of you but I have to repeat 30,33, 43 and 69. I have nothing more to say.'

30 - Chelsea's website highlighted the decisions Mourinho was talking about and clearly thought Barnes fouled Ivanovic.

33 - Not holding back, they were convinced Kightly handled the ball in the box following the Serbian's shot at goal and appear to feel hard done by.

43 - 'Clear' seems to be their thoughts on the penalty decisions and feel that Costa was 'pushed to the ground' but the referee didn't seem agree.

69 - A very angry Chelsea state that Barnes' tackle was 'potentially leg-breaking,' which doesn't seem to be far off the mark. 

Chelsea were frank about how they thought the decisions should have gone and didn't hold back on the Barnes tackle
