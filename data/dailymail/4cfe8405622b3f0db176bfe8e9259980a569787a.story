Reading winger Royston Drenthe challenged fans to a FIFA 14 tournament at his house on Sunday.

The former Everton and Real Madrid wideman took to Instagram to invite local Royals supporters for a game of the popular console game and revealed the winner would receive a 'nice prize'.

Nearly 800 people put their names forward before the 27-year-old then picked out four lucky winners to take part.

Posting a picture of the participants in what appeared to be his back garden, Drenthe said: 'Tournament about to begin good luck lads,' before proceeding to give a running commentary of the games as his guests battled it out.

The winner received one of Drenthe's match-worn Reading shirts and what appeared to be a cash prize - judging by the picture the midfielder shared via his Instagram account.

Having signed a two-year deal with Reading last summer, the Dutchman was reportedly told he could leave the Championship club in July and has also been stripped of his No 10 shirt.

Drenthe began his career with Feyenoord before spells with Real Madrid and Everton.

Joining the Toffees on loan in 2011, the left-footer went on to score three times in 21 appearances for the Blues.
