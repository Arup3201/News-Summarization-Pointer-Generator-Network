Liverpool's Lazar Markovic will discover how many European games he must sit out when UEFA’s disciplinary committee meet on Thursday.

UEFA have the £20million Serbian winger down for a four-match suspension on official lists after he was sent off in December’s final Champions League group clash with Basle at Anfield. However, Markovic has yet to be informed of his punishment.

Markovic, 20, had only been on the pitch for 15 minutes when he was sent off after his hand touched the face of Behrang Safari against Basle.

Markovic will definitely miss Thursday’s Europa League last 32 first leg with Besiktas at Anfield but Liverpool are yet to hear whether it will be more.

Meanwhile, Besiktas goalkeeper Tolga Zengin has been ruled out for a month. 

The 31-year-old Turkey international damaged knee ligaments in their 3-2 victory over Bursaspor in the Turkish Super League on Sunday.
