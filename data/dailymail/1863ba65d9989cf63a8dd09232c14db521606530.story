Australia have reunited Quade Cooper and Will Genia at half-back for Saturday's non-cap international against the Barbarians at Twickenham.

It will be the first time the Queensland Reds playmakers have been paired together by the Wallabies since last November's 30-26 victory over Wales in Cardiff.

Neither has featured for Australia this year with Cooper rehabilitating shoulder and hip injuries and Genia an ankle problem.
