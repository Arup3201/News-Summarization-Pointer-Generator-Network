Threats: PR man James Saville claimed to be working with Theresa May’s department

A Mail on Sunday journalist trying to uncover the truth about Fiona Woolf’s appointment to the child abuse inquiry received unwarranted threats from a PR man claiming to be working with the Home Office.

This newspaper was warned it would be reported to the new press complaints watchdog for simply arranging an interview with another panel member who could shed light on the controversy.

The threat was made by James Saville, a spokesman for Sharon Evans, a third person on the abuse inquiry. She runs a charity which includes Strictly Come Dancing star Kristina Rihanoff and Tony Blair’s daughter Kathryn among its trustees.

Last night, an MP said it sounded like another attempt at a cover-up. Labour’s Simon Danczuk said: ‘I find it bizarre. The last thing we want is for the Home Office, its representatives or PR people trying to silence journalists or to cover up the relationships that may have gone on.’

After a reporter had agreed last week to meet abuse survivor Graham Wilmer, who is on the inquiry panel, Mr Saville rang the journalist five minutes before the agreed interview time to say it had been called off. 

He then suggested the reporter had behaved improperly – a claim the journalist vehemently denies. In a reference to the new Independent Press Standards Organisation, Mr Saville said: ‘I don’t want to have to start getting Ipso involved.’

Mr Saville claimed to be working with Theresa May’s department, and suggested the reporter phone her head of press, Andy Tighe, if he did not believe him. 

But Mr Saville represents abuse victim Mrs Evans, who defended Mrs Woolf’s appointment in a BBC radio interview last week.

Mrs Evans runs a charity called the Dot Com Children’s Foundation, which has had significant support from the Home Office, including hosting a campaign launch where Strictly dancers showed off their moves to a room of civil servants.

As public criticism of Mrs Woolf intensified over her links to former Home Secretary Lord Brittan, Mrs Evans told Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday: ‘I am very confident this inquiry can do its job. We are satisfied that Fiona Woolf has the skills of a solicitor… We need balance and we need those skills.’ 

Yet her charity, whose trustees include Ms Blair and Ms Rihanoff, is helped by many of the organisations that will come under scrutiny in the inquiry, including the Home Office, which has admitted losing dozens of files on child abuse in the 1980s.

Mrs Evans admitted in her letter of possible conflicts of interest: ‘The Dot Com Children’s Foundation has received funding and support from a number of public sources including the Mayor of London’s office, the Fire Service through the Chief Officers’ Association, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Home Office, Foreign Office and Department for Education.’

The Home Office said it had not provided any funding to the Dot Com Children’s Foundation.

Last night Mr Tighe denied Mr Saville was working with the Home Office. But asked whether he had been speaking to Mr Saville, he refused to comment. 

‘I understand he works for Sharon Evans – he’s nothing to do with the Home Office,’ Mr Tighe added.
