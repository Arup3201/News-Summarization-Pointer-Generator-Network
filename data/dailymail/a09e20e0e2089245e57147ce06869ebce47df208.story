Soldiers returning from fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan will be given a gene mutation blood test to assess their suicide risk.

The trial will be carried out on US army soldiers after it was reported that suicides in American  military had tripled.

The prototype test measures changes to stress levels in the brain and has already been used on 325 civilian volunteers.

Between 2004 and 2012, the rate tripled from 9.6 per 100,000 to 29.2, the Independent on Sunday reports.

Scientists
discovered stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called 
SKA2 and people with suicidal tendencies also have lower levels of the 
gene.

Picking
 up on this change could make it possible for doctors to predict a 
person’s risk of suicide using a simple blood test - and monitor people 
most likely to harm themselves.

The
 SKA2 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area 
involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive 
behaviour.

It 'chaperones' stress hormones into a cell’s nucleus so that they can work to suppress stress levels.

Yet
 if there are not enough SKA2 or it is altered, the stress hormone 
receptor cannot suppress the release of the 'stress hormone' cortisol in
 the brain  - leading to suicidal thoughts.

Professor
 Zachary Kaminsky, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 
said: 'Suicide is a major preventable public health problem.

'But
 we have been stymied in our prevention efforts because we have no 
consistent way to predict those who are at increased risk of killing 
themselves. 

'With
 a test like ours, we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying 
those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe.'

Researchers
 looked at mutations in the gene SKA2 in brain samples from mentally ill
 people who had died from suicide - and then compared them with healthy 
individuals.

They discovered levels of SKA2 were significantly lower in people who had killed themselves.

And that within this common mutation, there was a modification that changed the way this gene functioned.

The modification added chemicals called methyl groups to the gene.

Blood tests revealed there were higher levels of methylation in the SKA2 gene for people with a record of suicidal thoughts or attempts.

The researchers then designed a model to
 predict which of the participants were experiencing suicidal thoughts -
 or had attempted suicide with 80 per cent certainty.

The SKA2 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour

Those with more severe risk of suicide were predicted with 90 per cent accuracy.

In younger people, blood tests enabled scientists to predict whether a person had attempted suicide with 96 per cent accuracy.

Professor 
 Kaminsky said: 'We have found a gene that we think could be really 
important for consistently identifying a range of behaviours from 
suicidal thoughts to attempts to completions. 

'We
 need to study this in a larger sample but we believe that we might be 
able to monitor the blood to identify those at risk of suicide.'

The research was published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.
