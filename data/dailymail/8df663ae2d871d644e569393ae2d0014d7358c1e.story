An Ohio community was up in arms after a suspected drunk driver veered off the road into a shallow pond near a community center, marking the driver's sixth arrest for driving while impaired.

The police department in Massillon, Ohio decided to use the drunken crash as a teaching moment, posting a picture of the driver’s hunter green Dodge pickup truck half submerged in water, on their Facebook page and warning area residents of the dangers of drunk driving.

Police say Robert Schreckengost failed to negotiate a turn on a winding road in downtown Massillon and his truck ended up in a retention pond shortly before midnight on Saturday, behind the Massillon Recreation Center.

The photo says it all: Police posted this picture of a Dodge pickup truck driven by Robert Schreckengost, who police suspect was drunk, in a shallow pond near a community center in Massillon, Ohio

A sign with an 'arrow shows the road doesn't go any further but he apparently didn't see that and he plowed right through,' Station Sgt. John DiLoreto said.

6 strikes and you're out: Robert Schreckengost was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, his sixth arrest for the offense

The 42-year-old driver, who police say smelled of alcohol, was able to exit his vehicle but fire fighters and police were called to the scene to deal with the truck.

Though the man had no visible injuries, he was transported to a local hospital to be checked.

Police administered a urine test but the results have not yet been released.

They say that there is no evidence to suspect any illegal drugs were involved. 

The Massillon Police Department posted a photo of the mishap on their Facebook page on Sunday, writing to local residents, 'Another reminder of the dangers of OVI.'

The posting amassed 49 likes on the social-networking website but many users wondered why the driver was still allowed on the road despite his multiple run-ins with the law.

'Why do people with more than 1 or even 2 ovi offenses still have a license to drive?' Kerri Everly wrote, with another local demanding, 'Lock him up for Pete's sake!!!'

'Lucky he didn't kill anyone...with 5 previous ovi convictions this will be his 6th you can't rehabilitate this guy just do everyone including him a favor and keep him locked up,' another resident, Kevin L Carpenter, vented.

Schreckengost was driving on a suspended license.

After getting the all-clear from doctors after the incident, Schreckengost was transported to the Stark County Jail on a felony OVI (operating a vehicle impaired) charge, and charges of driving under suspension and operating without reasonable control.

He was arraigned on Monday and has pleaded not guilty.

He is being held at the Stark County Jail, on $50,000 bond and is next scheduled to appear in court on September 5.

His vehicle was impounded.

The Massillon Recreation Center, where the incident occurred, is a fitness and activity facility for the community of Massillon, located south of Cleveland, that has an estimated population of 32,000.

A rep for the center said there was no visible damage to the property after the weekend incident.
