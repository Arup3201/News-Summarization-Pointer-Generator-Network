Che Adams turned  Shefifeld United's Capital One Cup semi-final against Tottenham on its head with two goals in two minutes, but his manager Nigel Clough was left ruing the attacker celebrating his first goal.

After replacing Jamal Campbell-Ryce on 74, Adams slotted clinically past Michel Vorm from a narrow angle to haul United back into the cup tie. 

Bramall Lane erupted and clearly swept up the 18-year-old Adams into the emotion as he ran off to celebrate rather than picking the ball out of the net with his team still chasing another goal.

But he made amends, scoring another two minutes later on 79 to ensure a nervy ending for Tottenham, who eventually secured their passage to Wembley with a second goal from midfielder Christian Eriksen.

'I am delighted with Che Adams,' Clough said. 'We like the look of him, he is raw and has a lot of potential. But he needs to learn not to celebrate when we are chasing another goal.'

Clough's cold remark will undoubtedly draw comparisons to his father, Brian. 

But the Blades manager spoke of his pride after the League One side were eliminated by their illustrious, Premier League opponents in the closing moments of the game, when  Eriksen reached a pass from Harry Kane and caressed the ball across Mark Howard and into the far corner of the net.

'I am incredibly proud of the players for what they have given over the two legs, to run a team like Spurs close,' Clough said to Sky Sports 1 after the full time whistle. 'That bit of quality missing tonight. The crowd and everyone at the club gave everything they had.'

Clough's opposite number, Mauricio Pochettino, could not conceal his delight at booking a place at Wembley on March 1.

Mauricio Pochettino said United put Tottenham under 'unbelievable pressure' during the cup match

'I am very very happy, happy for our players because they deserve to go to the final, to Wembley and happy for our supporters, they deserve it too,' Pochettino said. 'In football you need to score when you have the possibility. 

'Sheffield put unbelievable pressure on the pitch and it was a difficult last 10-12 minutes.'
