A new female-only social network hopes to offer a space where women can speak freely without the interference of men.

Former Facebook employee Susan Johnson founded Women.com as a stripped-down question and answer forum where users can discuss careers, relationships, health, sex, beauty, parenthood, politics, fashion and more.

One anonymous conversation topic is featured daily, Slate reports, and all members of the Women.com community are able to weigh in.Members simply upvote the most relevant answers.

Not her first rodeo: Before founding female-only social network Women.com, Susan Johnson spent two-and-a-half years working in global marketing at Facebook

Current questions range from, 'Have You Ever Slept Your Way Into (or Out of) Something?' to 'Do You Feel Bad For Victims of the iCloud Nude Photo Hack?' While other users beg for advice: 'Need Help With Liquid Eyeliner!' or 'Hair do Hell'. 

A well organized community management team keeps the site free of trolling and misogyny and fosters conversations about tough issues in a ‘well-lit, positive manner’. 

And if a man tries to join the ladies' club? ‘We’ve had a couple of men try to break in, and we just escort them out,’ says Johnson.

The site is invite-only and users gain access via Facebook Connect, limiting potential for men to gain access via fake profiles. Transgender women who identify as female, she adds, are 100per cent welcome.

Unlike Facebook, which focuses on photo sharing and status updates, Johnson chose to organize her network around questions and answers because she believes a good question is the foundation of a great conversation between female friends.

‘Today’s main question [“Friend’s husband is cheating. Do I say something?”] was really interesting,’ Johnson says. ‘I don’t think anyone would ever post that on Facebook, and it’s a true dilemma.’

‘You can Google that stuff, and Yahoo Answers will be your only result, and you won’t know who you’re talking to, and the answer will be somewhat … illiterate. Or the question about how to raise a daughter who respects herself—you can ask that on Facebook, but you won't get access to this larger community of women with experience.’

Given that female users account for 58per cent of Facebook and 84per cent of Pinterest, Women.com shouldn’t have trouble attracting an audience. The site is currently in an invite-only beta stage, but Johnson hopes to open it up to the general public soon.

She also plans to grow the site into a more complex network. She hopes to include interest segmentation and develop microcommunities around different topics so members can have side discussions about articles they find interesting, events in their area, or books they’re reading. Quora-style expertise identifiers are also in the works.

‘On Facebook, we’re talking with seemingly everyone, so we’re not necessarily sharing our thoughts on the Middle East, or even what we bought at Nordstrom.’ Johnson says. She hopes these women-only conversations will foster a different type of discussion that is currently difficult to have online.
