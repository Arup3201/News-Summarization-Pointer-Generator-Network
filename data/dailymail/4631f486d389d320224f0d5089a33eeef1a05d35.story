Praised: A bottle of Miraval 2013 will sell for 15 euros

The latest Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie sequel is being described as powerful and elegant with a 'mouthwatering finish.' 

However, these raving reviews do not appear in movie publications.

They're from Decanter magazine's review of the celebrity couple's second vintage of rosé wine.

The wine was produced at their French Provencal estate, Chateau Miraval. 

The 2013 Miraval goes on sale online on Friday.

It will be in shops and restaurants around the world next month.

Decanter describes the Cotes de 
Provence rose as 'charmingly pretty in colour' with 'a delicate 
structure that deepens through the palate.'

The
 2012 vintage, Pitt's and Jolie's first since buying the 1,200 acre 
estate, was the highest-ranked rosé on Wine Spectator's annual Top 100 
wines list. 

Around 200,000 bottles of the '13 will be sold for around 15 euros (£12.50) each.

The couple returned to Los Angeles yesterday after enjoying a break at Australia's Airlie beach.

The couple have been living apart since last November, when the mother-of-six relocated with her children to Australia to direct her Second World War World War.

Both Pitt and Jolie attended the wrap party of her film Unbroken on Monday night.
