Chelsea's hopes of a historic treble came to grinding halt as the Premier League leaders were dumped out of the Champions League last 16 on away goals by Paris Saint-Germain.

PSG twice came from behind at Stamford Bridge, demonstrating great character to play for the last hour of normal time and the added 30 minutes without star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, after he had been sent off for a foul on Oscar. He later described the Chelsea players as 'babies' for their attempts to influence the referee.

In a highly physical match, replete with fouls and contentious decisions, Gary Cahill's second-half strike looked to be sending Chelsea through to the next round, before their former player David Luiz equalised to bring about extra time. Blues forward Eden Hazard then scored a penalty for the home side after Thiago Silva's handball in the box in the first half of extra time, but the PSG captain soon atoned for his error with a goal of his own six minutes from time to secure the Ligue 1 side's progression to the quarter-finals, much to the delight of goading rival fans online.

Here are some of the best memes and tweets from social media on the night...
