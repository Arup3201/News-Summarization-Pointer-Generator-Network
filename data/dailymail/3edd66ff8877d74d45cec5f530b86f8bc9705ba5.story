Drug mule Melissa Reid is set to see her mother for the first time since being caught trying to smuggle £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of Peru.

The 20-year-old is awaiting sentence in a squalid Peruvian jail with Michaella McCollum Connolly, after the pair were stopped in August attempting to board a flight to Spain at Lima International Airport with 24lb of the class-A drug in their suitcases. 

In September, the British women pleaded guilty to drug trafficking.

Mother's love: Debbie Reid has flown to Peru to see her daughter Melissa, who is waiting to be sentenced for drug trafficking. Melissa, and another young woman Michaella McCollum Connolly, were caught trying to smuggle £1.5m worth of cocaine out of Peru

Debbie Reid hasn’t seen her daughter since July, when the then teenager left the family home in Lenzie, near Glasgow, for the party island Ibiza. 

But on Friday night Debbie arrived in Lima with her husband William, ready to visit Melissa behind bars.

Last night, in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Debbie said: ‘I can’t wait to see her. To speak to her on the phone has been lovely but to see her in person – to hold her, just to touch her – will be so different.

Limbo: Melissa Reid is awaiting sentence at the Virgen de Fatima jail. The minimum possible jail term is six years eight months

‘I always thought she was so grown up but everything that’s happened has changed that. 

‘This situation has made her feel like my baby daughter again – I’m mummy instead of mum. 

‘I feel as if we’re in limbo waiting for the sentence. 

‘When it does come, at least we will have something to aim for.’

Melissa’s parents have brought their daughter gifts and letters from family and friends including a doll hand-knitted by Melissa’s grandmother, and a customised pillow with pictures of her friends printed on it.

Melissa and Michaella, also 20, are waiting to hear what their sentence will be. The minimum possible jail term is six years eight months. 

If they had pleaded not guilty and been convicted, they could have  been sentenced to up to 15 years’ imprisonment.

The pair, who both worked in Ibiza this summer, share a cramped cell with 38 other prisoners and have to endure freezing showers at Virgen de Fatima jail, where they are the only foreign inmates.

In a recent diary entry, Melissa revealed her struggle to come to terms with her ordeal, including being so far away from her sisters – twins who have just turned 19.

‘Today was my little twin sisters’ birthday,’ she wrote. ‘This is the first milestone that I have missed within my family for being in this nightmare!

'The ten-minute phone calls are never enough but especially when all I want to do is sing “happy birthday to you” a million times to them! 

‘It feels like only yesterday that the three of us were being mistaken for triplets playing innocently and being young kids!

'And now their big sister is half way across the world in prison – if only I could rewind back time to be young again!’

In a bizarre twist, Melissa is being bombarded with letters from prisoners in the UK and Ireland trying to befriend her.
