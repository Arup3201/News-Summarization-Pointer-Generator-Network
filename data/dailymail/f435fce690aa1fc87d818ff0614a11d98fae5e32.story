Classroom assistant Rachael Regan (pictured appearing at Bradford Crown Court) was spared jail today after she taped a 7-year-old to her chair and shut her in a storeroom

A classroom assistant who carried out a five-month campaign of bullying against a seven-year-old pupil who was taped to her chair and shut in a storeroom has been spared jail.

Rachael Regan 'singled out and bullied' the girl at a primary school in the Calderdale area of West Yorkshire, a court heard.

Regan's trial last month was told about a catalogue of incidents against the pupil, who is now nine. 

They included sticking Post-it notes to her thumbs, tying her shoes on with string, calling her a nickname, goading her with a biscuit, hiding her doll and tearing up her photograph.

Other children in the class laughed as the girl was subjected to the supposedly 'good-humoured' pranks by Regan.

Today, at Bradford Crown Court, the 43-year-old was given a community order including a requirement to do 40 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Neil Davey QC  spared her jail after he criticised the length of time the classroom assistant had spent on bail before she was charged while the Crown Prosecution Service  decided what to do.

He added the wait was a punishment in itself.

Regan, of Illingworth, West Yorkshire, was found guilty of child cruelty after the trial, which finished last month.

A teacher colleague, Deborah McDonald, 41, was cleared of the same offence.

Today, Judge Davey said to her: 'You have been convicted by a jury of cruelty to a small child, in effect of bullying her to the extent that it would properly be described as cruelty.'

He said her conduct had been 'shameful' and a breach of trust.

The judge said: 'You breached that trust by turning her into a figure of fun.'

He said Regan invited others to ridicule the girl when she taped her to a chair.

Judge Davey said the defendant had already lost the job she loved and would be barred from working with children.

'You have lost your job, and lost your good name.

'Having humiliated the girl, you have been professionally humiliated and now publicly humiliated.'

Regan has been placed on the Barred List preventing her working with vulnerable people.

The judge added: 'You were cruelly bullying her. Any such conduct by an adult would be shameful, made more shameful because your victim was only seven years old and in your care.

'She came from a challenging home environment and you were trusted to look after her.

'You betrayed that trust by turning her into a figure of fun by taping her to a chair and inviting children to look at her and laugh at her.'

Judge Davey said the girl had now recovered from her ordeal and was 'back to her old happy, bubbly, extrovert self'.

He pointed out that the allegations were made in January 2013 but Regan was not charged until last April.

He told her this period of 'legal limbo' she lived through was 'substantial punishment' as she lived for months with the uncertainly of not knowing whether she would eventually face prison.

Prosecutor Simon Waley told the week-long trial last year that an investigation was launched by the school and the police after the girl told her mother about the incident.

The 7-year-old girl had came out of school at home time in a distressed state before telling her mother she had been fastened to the chair with Sellotape by a teacher and could not move for about ten minutes.

The teaching assistant later said that she did it for 'a bit of fun' because the girl had been 'fidgety', the court heard.

Mr Waley said: 'She said that the class had been laughing at her and that she was the 'class clown'.'

Mr Waley said: 'She said that Mrs Regan put it all around the chair and it was hard breathing.

'She said that she couldn't get out to reach her things. She said that the whole class were laughing.'

The girl's mother said the moment her daughter told her a teaching assistant had taped her to a chair was 'heartbreaking'.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the jury the young girl 'clung' to her 'for dear life' with tears streaming down her face after the incident.

Mr Waley told the trial that the girl also said to police that Regan bound string to her legs and feet to keep her pumps on.

He added: 'She said it was horrible and that, again, everybody had been laughing.'

The girl told police that Regan put Post-it notes on to her thumbs when she had been sucking them and shut the door to a store room, leaving her on a chair inside.

Other children had been given biscuits for good homework, the court heard, but she was left out and she was told her how delicious they were.

The alleged bullying took place between September 2012 and January last year. 

Other staff members at the school told police they had witnessed some of the incidents.

One support assistant said the girl's arms were 'fastened down by her sides with the Sellotape around her more than once' and said she was taped to the chair for around ten minutes.

She said Regan went to another classroom to fetch another teaching assistant to show her what she had done.

Mr Waley said Regan told her colleague: 'She'll not get up and wander around the classroom now.'

He added that Regan had also pulled a photograph of the girl off the wall and ripped it to pieces in front of her.

The court heard that the defendants denied ever bullying the girl when they were interviewed by the police and described some of the incidents as 'fun' and 'a joke'.

Regan refused to answer questions today as she left court with a friend.
