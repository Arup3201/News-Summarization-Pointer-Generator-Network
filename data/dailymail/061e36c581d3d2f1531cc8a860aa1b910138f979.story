Heroin addict: Michael Sines, 39. His victim will never walk again as a result of his attack

A violent 20-stone thug was behind bars tonight after he left a frail pensioner crippled and unable ever to walk again during a brutal robbery in her own home.

Michael Sines, of Windsor, Berkshire, admitted he was 'scum' as he received a six and a half year sentence for shoving 84-year-old Veronica Manser to the floor in the hallway of her flat and stealing £150 from her purse.

The 6ft 5in brute bundled the OAP over, shattering her pelvis as she used her Zimmer frame and has left the previously independent OAP wheelchair-bound for the rest of her life.

He fled the scene, leaving her lying on the floor in distress until her daughter found her half an hour later.

After three unsuccessful operations, the victim suffers from depression and now struggles to leave her home in Crowthorne, Berkshire, the court heard.

Jailing the heroin addict at Reading Crown Court, Judge Richard Parkes said: 'All you cared about was getting your drugs and you have caused this woman pain and the loss of her independence.

'The aggravating factors of this case is Mrs Manser was vulnerable and elderly. By your reckless actions, you caused serious life-changing injuries to her.'

The judge had heard how Sines conned his way inside the gated block of flats where Mrs Manser lived before targeting her as she slowly walked back to her home after delivering a letter to a nearby post box.

'You wanted her purse and did so without considering the consequences to her, the judge told Sines.

'You are a heavily-built man of 39 years of age; she is a frail old lady. The consequences were life-threatening.

'She
 is now confined to a wheelchair and unable to walk. She's in constant 
pain despite taking painkillers and wakes up several times in the night.

'The violence you did to her means she is now dependent on carers as she was not before.

'She is depressed and finds it hard to keep control of her emotions without breaking down.'

The criminal stared straight ahead without expression as the judge made his damning sentencing remarks.

Prosecutor Jonathan Sank had told how the frail OAP was making her way indoors with her Zimmer frame when Sines attacked on October 24, 2012.

'She was just back inside the front door when she felt what she says was the "most enormous push",' said Mr Sank.

Shattered: Mrs Manser's daughter Sue Coffey, said: 'We as a family feel great sadness that our mother is now a shadow of her former self because of his actions'

'After the push, he took Mrs Manser's purse from a compartment attached to her walking frame.

'Inside that was £150 in cash which had been withdrawn by her a day or two before.

'He fled. Mrs Manser pressed her lifeline button and help was summoned.'

Sines' victim was still on the floor when her shocked daughter Sue Coffey, 53, turned up at the flats and found her a short while later.

His shove during the crime had broken her pelvis, leading to three unsuccessful operations causing constant pain and depression, the court heard.

Mr Sank said: 'She contracted infections as a result of the aggressive treatment which was required and the situation was life-threatening.

'As a consequence of one infection, she suffered hallucinations.

'However, Mrs Manser was sufficiently lucid to recall the extreme stress she was in and the nature of the hallucinations and feelings of being under attack; lashing out at things that are not there, and screaming.'

Mr Sank went on: 'Although she has now returned home, she will never walk again. Even now, 15 months later, she is in constant discomfort. She wakes two or three time a night in pain.

'She can't go out on her own and she's lost a considerable degree of her independence.'

Sines was said to have more than 50 previous convictions going back to the early 1990s for theft, burglary and violent assaults stemming from a long-held addiction to Class A drugs.

The court heard the violent heroin user was jailed for five years in 2005 for stabbing a Homebase store manager during a row over a £50 pounds refund. The manager suffered a collapsed lung but survived the attack.

His defence barrister Nick Cotter told the judge his client was 'genuinely remorseful' and had been clean of drugs before the attack.

He said Sines' drug-taking and offending had started again after he struggled to deal with his mother's death in 2010.

'He has come round to a very firm conclusion that what he did that day was a very nasty thing to do to a fellow human being,' Mr Cotter told the judge.

'He says, in his own language, that "this is the scummiest thing I have ever been involved in".'

'He wishes through me to apologise to the victim and her relatives for what he did. He appreciates of course he can not turn the clock back.

'If only he could.'

Speaking after the case, Mrs Manser's daughter Sue Coffey, said: 'We as a family feel great sadness that our mother is now a shadow of her former self because of his actions.

'We are delighted that he is now in prison for a long time. It has been a very long two years. We are delighted he has been caught and he now has to face the punishment for it.

'I hope his apology is genuine and that he now can reflect on what he did to my mum.'

Mrs Manser also thanked Thames Valley Police for bringing Sines to justice in what she called a 'very difficult case'.
