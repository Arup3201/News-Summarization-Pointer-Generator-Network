An ex-convict has been arrested on suspicion of detonating a chain of bombs outside a Communist Party building on Wednesday allegedly because 'he wanted revenge on society', police said.

Feng Zhijun, 41, who had previously spent nine years in prison for theft, set off several small explosives in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan on Wednesday, killing one and injuring at least eight people.

'Police found home-made explosive devices at his residence, and a large amount of evidence of his crimes,' state television said. 'Feng Zhijun fully confessed to the evidence of his crimes.'

Attack: Smoke rises into the air outside the Communist Party headquarters after several explosions went off

Aftermath: Onlookers watch policemen working at the site of the explosions outside the provincial headquarters of China's ruling Communist Party in Taiyuan

Blast: A Chinese police officer is framed by the glass window of a vehicle damaged by the explosions

Feng 'admitted to wanting to get revenge on society', it added, without elaborating.

Police caught him early on Friday and also seized a vehicle that they believe was used during the attacks, media said.

The
central government sent a deputy minister of public security to lead 
the search, along with DNA and other experts, the report added, 
underscoring the government's sensitivity about any form of unrest.

Wednesday's bombings killed one person and wounded eight, according to state media reports.Such
incidents are not uncommon in China and underscore the government's 
worries about stability in the world's second-largest economy, with a 
widening gap between rich and poor and growing anger at corruption and 
environmental problems.

Casualties: Bloodstains were left on the pavement after the explosions

Response: Members of a Taiyuan police Swat team arriving at the site of the attack

The 
government blamed Islamists for an attack in Beijing last week when a 
car ploughed through bystanders on the edge of Tiananmen Square and 
burst into flames, killing three people in the car and two bystanders.

The
incidents come as China ramps up security before top leaders gather on 
Saturday for a plenum meeting in Beijing to discuss reforms.

In
2011, a farmer bombed three government buildings in Fuzhou city in 
Jiangxi province after failing to get redress over seizure of his land. 
Two people and the farmer were killed.

A
42-year-old farmer with terminal lung cancer detonated a home-made 
device aboard a bus in Fujian province in 2005, wounding 31 and killing 
himself, possibly to protest against prohibitive healthcare costs.
