Blocked: The signal emitted by TV devices have blocked key fobs causing drivers to become trapped on their drives

The march of TV technology is being blamed for stopping motorists in their tracks… literally.

A popular device that allows viewers to transmit signals to televisions around their home can render remote car key fobs useless.

As a result car owners are left stranded on their driveways because they can’t get into their vehicles or, in some cases, start them up.

The problem can come from just one so-called ‘video sender’ but it has the potential to upset a whole street of motorists.

The revelation came from broadcast regulator Ofcom which was called in to investigate the issue in a road in Southampton.

Inspectors found a resident’s wireless sender attached to their satellite TV box was to blame. When it was switched off the neighbours’ fobs started working again.

Ofcom said ‘leakage’ from the sender emitted the same frequency as the fobs and blocked their signal.

Video senders can be bought from around £80. They take the signal from a cable or satellite TV set-top box and transmit it wirelessly to other TVs in the house.

But there can be momentary interference when viewers press to change channel. Sometimes the senders jam, continuing to transmit interference. The continued signal can hit cars in a whole street, says Ofcom.

Spokesman Rhys Hurd said: ‘Over the past 12 months we have responded to 140 of these cases and a lot of them relate to senders.

‘Our teams have to knock on doors to see how many people are affected. It can be a whole  street. Sometimes people say the problem happens in the morning, and then again from tea-time – in line with someone’s work patterns. That’s a big clue.’

The Southampton street case caused chaos for residents. One, Madeleine Wentworth, said: ‘Everyone was baffled. We knew there was something wrong.’

The problem is most acute for those with the most sophisticated car that have ‘keyless entry’ where the fob is needed to start the car.

Sky said it did not endorse the use of senders with its products. It said its boxes did not interfere with any other wireless devices.
