While he faces another 28 years behind bars in Peru, the prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway may be freed just long enough to face trial in the U.S.

Joran van der Sloot is one step closer to being carted to the United States in an extradition that could bring him face-to-face with Ms Holloway's mother, seven years after 18-year-old Natalee vanished in Aruba.

But legal hurdles - including van der Sloot’s appeal for his Peru murder conviction - will keep the process from going through immediately.

Convicted: Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years in prison in the murder of Stephany Flores

Van der Sloot’s lawyer Maximo Altez told CNN: 'I think he will be extradited within the next three months'.

Mr Altez added that if van der Sloot is convicted in America, he will be returned to Peru to serve out the remainder of his sentence there, and then shipped back to the U.S. to serve whatever sentence he may receive in the extortion case.

In the U.S., he is accused of trying to extort $250,000 from Beth Holloway to tell her where to find the remains of her daughter, who was 18 when she disappeared in Aruba.

Prosecutors said $25,000 was paid to van der Sloot, but nothing was disclosed about the Ms Holloway's whereabouts.

Authorities said they believe the Dutchman used the money to travel to Peru on May 14, 2010, where he was convicted of killing Stephany Flores, a woman he met in a Lima casino, on May 25.

The date is a chilling one to the family of Natalee Holloway, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen.

He took cash and credit cards from Ms Flores before fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after she found out about his suspected involvement in the Natalee Holloway case.

Under Peru's penal system, van der Sloot could become eligible for parole after serving half of the sentence with good behaviour, including work and study.

Altez 
said his client fears extradition because U.S. prisons have a reputation
for being 'very hard' on inmates.

Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30, 2005, during a high school graduation trip to Aruba, where Van der Sloot grew up.

Her body was never found and repeated searches turned up nothing as intense media coverage brought the case worldwide attention.

Investigators have long worked from the assumption that the young woman was dead in Aruba, where the case was classified as a homicide investigation.

That investigation remains open, though there has been no recent activity, according to Solicitor General Taco Stein, an official with the prosecutor's office in Aruba.
