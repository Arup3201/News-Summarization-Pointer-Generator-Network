World Cup winner has Toni Kroos arrived in Mallorca for a well-deserved holiday as his agents put the finishing touches to his £20m move to Real Madrid.

Kroos's contract was due to expire next season and despite negotiations taking place throughout the season Bayern Munich failed to agree terms with the midfielder.

Heavily touted moves to Manchester United and Chelsea were on the cards but the 24-year-old recently confirmed that he would be joining Los Blancos instead.

The European champions are looking to add to their ranks as they try to keep pace with big-spending Barcelona, who recently signed Luis Suarez.

However, Bayern Munich's CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, told AS they will not let the midfielder go for less than his release clause of €25million (£20million).

For a relatively young player, Kroos boasts considerable experience, having already won 11 major trophies including the World Cup, Champions League, Bundesliga and World Club Cup.
