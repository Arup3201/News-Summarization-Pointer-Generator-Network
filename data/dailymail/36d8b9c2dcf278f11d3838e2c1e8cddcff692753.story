Most people were resting after tucking into a feast of roasted turkey and delicious side dishes.

But at 2.30pm on Thanksgiving Day, someone else was outside having fun.

A monkey was spotted by several people leaping around Tampa in Florida  on the national holiday.

Still on the loose: A monkey was spotted  leaping around Tampa in Florida on Thanksgiving Day (file picture)

The animal, described as being around three feet tall, brown and 'fast', was first seen by a shocked resident running through a yard on Hiawatha Street.

Around an hour later, it was sighted again on Sligh Ave, prompting a passerby to dial 911, according to a Facebook post by Tampa Police Department.

Patrol officers, who responded to the call, checked with Lowery Park Zoo officials that they were not missing a monkey. However, they were assured that all of their primates were accounted for.

The animal's current whereabouts remain unknown. Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office has not yet received any calls about loose monkeys, police told WPTV.

On the lookout: In a Facebook post (pictured), the Tampa Police Department said there was 'no probable cause for this monkey's arrest'. It added that the mystery animal's current whereabouts remain unknown

'At this time, the monkey's whereabouts is unknown,' the Facebook post said. 'There is no probable cause for this monkey's arrest, however, we will work tirelessly to apprehend him.'

It is not the first time a monkey has been sighted in Tampa. From 2008 to 2012, a monkey was on the loose in the Bay area and even bit a woman before it was finally captured.

The evasive animal, once dubbed the Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay and later named Cornelius, is now living in captivity in Dade City, Florida. 

Anyone with information on the latest monkey sighting can contact police on 813-231-6130.
