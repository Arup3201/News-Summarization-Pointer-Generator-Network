A labourer has been banned from keeping or handling fish after being filmed swallowing a goldfish and washing it down with a can of Strongbow. 

Luke Berry posted a video of himself on social media attempting to down the creature three times after a day of heavy drinking. 

The 26-year-old from Farringdon, Oxon, was reported to police after RSPCA investigators found the clip online.

He was branded 'uncivilised and disgusting' in front of magistrates in Oxford and banned from keeping or handling fish in future.

Luke Berry was banned from keeping or handling fish after a video of him downing a goldfish with a can of Strongbow was reported to police

In the video titled 'Here fishy fishy', the 26-year-old coughs the creature up three times before swallowing it whole

During the video, Berry coughs up the squirming fish three times before swallowing it whole.

Dressed in an Arsenal football shirt and clutching a can of Strongbow cider, he is seen downing the fish before showing his empty mouth to the camera. 

The clip, titled Here Fishy Fishy, was reported to police following an RSPCA investigation. 

Prosecutor Paddy Roche said: 'This case arises as a consequence of the RSPCA getting wind of a video that had been posted on Facebook. 

The labourer's lawyer said he was 'ashamed' of his behaviour and had been encouraged by friends.  

'He was extremely intoxicated at the time. He was egged on. He fully accepts what has happened,' said Alice Dodds. 

She added the 26-year-old, who receives £70 a week in benefits, had overcome a background of 'heavy drinking' before filming the video. 

Berry was ordered to pay a £500 fine after being described by magistrates as 'disgusting'. 

Presiding magistrate Iain McCoubrey said Berry could be punished with a 12 month community order with 120 hours of unpaid work.

The labourer looked jubilant after being let off with a fine and banning order preventing him from owning fish for five years

'We are sentencing you for an act of animal cruelty. 

'It was a particularly disgusting thing to do, in particular filming it and posting it on Facebook was uncivilised. It was unacceptable.

'This offence of animal cruelty is serious enough for us to make a community order. You will have to comply with an order to carry out unpaid work.'

He was banned for keeping or handling fish for five years. 

Speaking after the sentencing, the RSPCA's Inspector Andy Eddy said: 'We are very satisfied with the sentence. 

'It demonstrates that it is unacceptable to behave in this way, to cruelly treat an animal in this fashion, and then post it online for entertainment.'
