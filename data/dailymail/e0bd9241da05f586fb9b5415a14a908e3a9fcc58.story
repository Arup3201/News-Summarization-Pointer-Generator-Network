A police officer and mother of two young sons was shot dead in Santa Cruz yesterday alongside another policeman.

The pair were chasing a sexual assault suspect, who was later gunned down in a shoot-out with police which was caught on camera by a bystander yesterday.

The terrifying footage shows a fight between police and the fugitive, with gunfire ringing through the air until one of the officers yells out, 'Suspect down!'

The two police officers, Det. Loran 'Butch' Baker and Det. Sgt Elizabeth Butler, were the first cops ever to be killed in the line of duty in the California city.

It is believed the suspect, 
35-year-old Jeremy Goulet, fired at the two officers killing them both.
 He was later fatally shot himself as he tried to flee.

'Our department is in mourning,' Santa Cruz Police Chief Kevin Vogel told the San Jose Mercury News.

'This
 is a horrific day. We lost two exceptionally fine officers today. We 
need to figure out a way to bring our department together as we work 
through this.'

Suspect: Jeremy Goulet, left in a 2007 police booking photo, allegedly opened fire on two Santa Cruz police detectives and The Kind Grind coffee shop from Goulet was recently fired

Sheriff Phil Wowak added: 'My heart goes out to those who were involved'.

Mr Baker was a 28-year veteran of the department whose son Adam also worked for Santa Cruz Police, while Ms Butler had served at the department for a decade.

Residents were left fearing for 
their lives as the sounds of gunfire overtook downtown residential 
streets in the middle of the afternoon and the sound of police 
helicopters whirred overhead.

An automatic police call went out warning them to stay inside prior to the shootout in which the suspect was killed.

In the video filmed by a local 
resident, police can be seen firing into a building entrance on Doyle 
Street before shouting 'suspect down' on the footage.
