This is the moment a Los Angeles TV reporter shoved a pedestrian out of his camera shot in the middle of filming a live segment.  

Steve Kuzj, from KTLA News, was on the streets of Hollywood Wednesday night to report on the measles outbreak when a man with gray curly hair ran up from behind shouting incoherently.

Kuzj, who is a second-degree black belt and has been practicing martial arts since age five, took no time to decide what to do next.

Kuzj, who is a second-degree black belt and has been practicing martial arts since age five, swiftly pushed the man out of his camera shot

He quickly pushed the man out of the way and continued on with his news segment. 

Kuzj later explained his actions on Twitter, saying that he was trying to protect himself and viewers from the man attempting to run on screen. 

'To be clear, that was a crazy man running at me, swearing, trying to get on TV. I was defending myself and viewers from hearing obscenities,' he wrote.

Kuzj is one of many TV reporters to be videobombed during a live segment. 

In December a weatherman caught headlines after getting an unexpected surprise on live TV as an excitable American bulldog jumped up to greet him mid-forecast. 

He later said on Twitter that the man, who can only be heard in the video shouting incoherently, could have been yelling obscenities and he wanted to protect viewers and himself

After the incident, Kuzj regained his composure and carried on with his segment on measles for the Los Angeles news channel

Sky Sports recently announced they were pulling street reporters after a series of problems during their live transfer coverage in September of last year.

This included one journalist trying to report the latest updates as a fan crept up behind him and shoved a sex toy in his ear.

KTLA viewers applauded Kuzj's quick-thinking and professionalism on Twitter.

Comedian Theo Von wrote: 'Ups to @SteveKuzj doing his job professionally and holding his ground at the same time.' 

'Great save! Way to keep your composure. @SteveKuzj,' wrote @crowther439. 

Kuzj may be a TV news reporter, by day, but he also takes pride in his martial arts talent.

In 2013 he uploaded a highlight reel of his skills to YouTube and now he has more than 27,000 views.

Kuzj later wrote on Twitter the reasoning behind the push. Many viewers supported his actions and applauded his composure and professionalism
