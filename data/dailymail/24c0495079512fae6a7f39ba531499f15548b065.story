A South Carolina couple are fighting to win back custody of a three-year-old Native American girl they adopted as a baby, after the Supreme Court ruled she should be handed back to her biological father due to 'tribal rights'.

Dusten Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, had never met his daughter before picking her up in his truck in December 2011, and had even told the girl's biological mother that he did not want her.

But after finding out the woman, who is not a Native American, had given the girl up for adoption, he invoked the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which gives American Indian parents preference in custody disputes.

Happy family: Matt and Melanie Capobianco with their adopted daughter Veronica, who has been taken out of their custody and given to her biological father as he is Native American

He won custody of the girl and her adoptive parents, Matt and Melanie Capobianco, have not seen her in a year as he has refused to allow them to contact her.

Now the Capobiancos are fighting to win back their daughter, Veronica, and in turn, they are battling the controversial federal law that has taken her away.

'No one can believe that this nightmare can happen in America,' Melanie told the Washington Times last month.  'We live in total grief.'

The South Carolina Supreme Court had ruled for Brown to have custody even though it called the Capobiancos 'ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment.'

But the law was put in place to be sensitive to distinctive
aspects of Native American culture and to protect children following 
cases of abuse against children from tribes, the New York Times reported.

Battle: Veronica, who is now three, was taken by her biological father, Dusten Brown (right), last December and the Capobiancos have not seen her since. He had originally said he wanted nothing to do with her

While family courts usually base their
decisions on the best interests of the child, the 1978 law notes other 
factors should be considered and the tribe's interest in the child is 
equal to that of the parents.

The Capobiancos believe the law has 
gone too far, and question whether a man who previously showed no 
interest in his child should take custody simply because of he is Native
American.

'There was no transition period, nothing for Veronica,' Melanie said. 'We were ordered to hand her over and that was it.

'We can't understand how she was given
no time to adjust or even meet her birth father in advance of him 
taking her back to Oklahoma.'

New home: Before Veronica's birth, Brown gave up his parental rights and her mother put her up for adoption

Missed: But on hearing that Veronica, pictured, was up for adoption, the father changed his mind

With the decision causing outrage, Paul Clement, the former U.S Solicitor General, and Thomas 
Lowndes, a founding member of the American Academy of Adoption 
Attorneys, have filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the 
Capobiancos to restore custody.

While the Supreme Court hears only 
about one per cent of cases that are submitted, the couple hopes that 
the Court will be among those heard in 2013.

Brown was given custody of Veronica even though he told his former fiancee, while she was pregnant with the girl, that he wanted nothing to do with the baby - by text message.

And in the ruling, one dissenting judge said Brown had 'turned his back on the joys and responsibilities of fatherhood at every turn', while another said his 'vanishing act triggered the adoption in the first instance'.

Fight: The Capobiancos have questioned whether it is right for a man - who previously showed no interest in his daughter - take her back simply because he is Native American

The Capobiancos, who live in Charleston, South Carolina, are in touch with the biological mother, who supports their parental rights, but Brown has not allowed them to contact Veronica.

'The concern should not be with a tribe, or a community, a birth parent or an adoptive parent. It should always be with the child,' Melanie said.

'This case is about fundamental justice for children. We are determined not to give up hope.'
