Coffee lovers who want to get the best flavour from their favourite brew should gulp the drink down rather than sip it.

Scientists say taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly.

They looked at ‘sip volume’ when drinking coffee and found larger sips have a ‘higher aroma release’.

The researchers said: ‘The findings could be useful to understand the factors which contribute to attract consumers to the pleasant aroma of coffee.’

However, the advice goes against that for other drinks, such as wine, where people are advised to take small amounts in their mouth to get the maximum flavour and aroma.

The researchers from the University of Naples said it was well known that smell and taste are related and that one can have a significant impact on the other.

Scientists at the University of Naples in Italy found that different coffee brewing technique appeared to affect aroma release and that the bigger the sip taken, the more fragrance was released

This study, published in the journal Food Research International, studied different sipping amounts and the impact they had on the smell of coffee.

It was found that different coffee brewing technique appeared to affect aroma release and that the bigger the sip taken, the more fragrance was released.

The researchers said the varying levels of aroma from different size sips or gulps could be explained by the amount of saliva in drinkers’ mouths.

They tested four different types of coffee brews - American, Neopolitan, moka and espresso.

Espresso coffee - the one type of coffee usually sipped - was identified as giving off the most aroma when bigger rather than smaller sips were taken.

Earlier this year, a separate study found that coffee doesn’t just perk you up – but just one mug a day can give your memory a boost too.

Researchers at the University of California found that a 200mg caffeine pill – equivalent to a strong mug – taken soon after a learning session improved image recall.

The caffeine-induced improvement was not seen with smaller doses of caffeine or when it was given an hour before viewing the images.

Smoking spoils the taste of a cup of coffee – even after quitting, according to recent research.

The strong, bitter taste of caffeine is usually easily detected, even in tiny amounts – but not for those who light up. It seems their ability to taste is harmed by the toxic chemicals found in tobacco.

To find out whether taste is still affected even after people stop smoking, scientists tested how well 451 volunteers could recognise the four basic flavours of sweet, sour, bitter and salty, as well as the intensity of each taste.

The study, published in the journal Chemosensory Perception, found that whether the volunteers smoked or not did not affect whether they could recognise salty, sweet or sour tastes – but it did have an effect on the bitter taste of caffeine.

One in five smokers and one in four ex-smokers could not correctly recognise the taste. However, a mere 13 per cent of non-smokers failed the taste test.

Researchers believe the build-up of tobacco in the body could stop taste buds renewing themselves and so harm a person’s ability to recognise certain tastes, even after they have stopped smoking.
