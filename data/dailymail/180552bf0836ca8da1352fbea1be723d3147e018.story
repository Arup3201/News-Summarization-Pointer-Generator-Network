A former paratrooper has paid back £5 he borrowed from a friend 50 years ago - with £170 interest.

David ‘Taffy’ Keegan lost touch with Victor Allin after they left the armed forces - but he never forgot the money 74-year-old Mr Allin lent him in 1964, and paid up as soon as they made contact again.

And to make amends Mr Keegan, 73, of Sydney, Australia, sent his old friend - a great-grandfather of four from Kennington, Kent, a cheque for more than £170 - calculated at 7 per cent annual interest.

Happy: Victor Allin and his wife Margaret with the cheque for £175  they were sent in payment of a £5 debt

It arrived in a Christmas card with 
the note: ‘Please accept the enclosed £5 at 7 per cent compound interest
 over 51 years in the spirit in which it is offered. Have a nice meal on
 your interest.’

Mr Allin, 
who also has 12 grandchildren, said: ‘It was such a nice shock. I’m 
pleased Taffy has now salved his conscience, as he told me that it often
 played on his mind.’

The two men met in 1958 when they both served with the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment.

The
 pair served in Cyprus, Germany, France and Bahrain, where their 
aircraft was blown up on the runway by angry locals and their soup 
poisoned by a rogue chef.

They lost contact in 1964 and Mr Keegan moved to Sydney, where he has lived ever since. But they got back in touch last year.

The
 former comrades only made contact when the Allins decided to look Mr 
Keegan up when they were on holiday in Prestatyn, North Wales, last year
 - as they knew he had once lived there.

Mr
 Allin said: ‘We found the address for a Keegan and we went to see him. 
We asked if he knew David, and he told us it was his brother.

‘He
 gave me quite a scare because he said we were 40 years too late. We 
thought he had died! But it turned out he had moved away many years 
ago.’

After inviting them 
in, Mr Keegan's brother, John, immediately spoke David via Skype in 
Sydney, to tell him his old friend had come to visit.

Mr Allin said: ‘He came on the phone and the first words he said to me were “I still owe you a fiver”. I had no memory of it.’

Mr Keegan said he had needed to borrow the money because he was ‘absolutely skint’.

He
 said: ‘Vic was flush with funds which I suspect could only have been 
amassed from a game of poker or a successful visit to the White City 
greyhounds.

‘As our pay at 
the time was four pound ten shillings plus an extra eight shillings a 
week for jumping out of planes, you can imagine what the ten pounds he 
lent me meant at the time.’

‘I
 managed to repay Vic half of what I owed him in 1964, leaving a fiver 
to be repaid at a later date. Time marched on and as often happens 
between good mates we lost touch with each other.

‘We
 have stayed in touch since and I am looking forward to shaking his hand
 when I visit him and his wife later this month whilst on my way to 
Paris.

‘The idea of facing 
him still owing him a fiver was too embarrassing, so I decided to repay 
him with interest before I arrived in Ashford.’

Going up: The cheque was sent from Australia for more than £170 - calculated at 7 per cent annual interest

In
 his Christmas card to Mr Allin, Mr Keegan also wrote: ‘When I left for 
Paris in 1962 I owed you £10. I repaid a fiver when I saw you in 
Aldershot in 1964 on my way to Tokyo for the 1964 Games.’

Mr Allin says he will spend his interest on a meal for the pair at the Eastwell Manor Hotel in Kent.

'Please accept the enclosed £5 at 7 per cent compound interest over 51 years in the spirit in which it is offered. Have a nice meal on your interest'

David Keegan's note

He
 added: ‘I'm really looking forward to seeing him. It is an exciting 
time. It will probably be the one and only time we see each other again.
 The cheque was a by-product really, the best thing is that we're now 
back in touch.’

Mr Keegan, who has lived in Sydney since 1973, added that he had always felt guilty about the debt.

He said: ‘Many is the time I woke worrying about owing a good mate a loan given without hesitation when I most needed it.

‘Imagine
 my surprise when I worked out that £5 at compound interest over the 
time meant I had to repay Vic one hundred and seventy pounds and seventy
 five pence.

‘I suppose the moral of the story is, don’t wait 50 years to repay an old mate a fiver.’
