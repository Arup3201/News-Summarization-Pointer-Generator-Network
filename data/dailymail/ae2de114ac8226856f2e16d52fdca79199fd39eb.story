For Francois Hollande, it would be fair to say the proverbial has hit the fan this week.

As if allegations the French president had a secret affair with an actress were not enough, several tonnes of horse manure have been dumped at the steps of his nation's parliament.

Gendarmes apprehended a protestor before he could finish unloading a white articulated lorry full of dung outside Paris's National Assembly today, witnesses said.

Dung: The protestor was stopped before he could finish unloading the truckload of manure in central Paris

Steaming: A message on the side of the articulated truck - which was parked outside the National Assembly in downtown Paris - read: 'Out with Hollande and the entire political class. Long live the Sixth Republic'

Now it's really hit the fan: The dumping came after a tumultuous week in French politics which saw claims of a presidential affair. Police had to stop traffic and apprehended the driver of the dung-laden truck

On the side of the truck was daubed a slogan: 'Out with Hollande and the entire political class. Long live the Sixth Republic.'

The present-day Fifth Republic was founded in 1958 with Charles de Gaulle its first president after France lost much of its colonial power after the Second World War.

The pungent demonstration happened today outside the Bourbon Palace, a 16th Century monument next to the river Seine in central Paris which houses France's lower house of parliament, the equivalent of the House of Commons.

Witnesses said the man was apprehended by police, who have since begun a mass clean-up.

The French magazine Closer published a seven-page report last Friday on Mr Hollande's alleged affair with the actress Julie Gayet.

Political muckraking: A slogan called for France's Sixth Republic. The fifth began with Charles de Gaulle in 1958

Dirty protest: The size of the dump required a large-scale clean-up operation. The National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament equivalent to the House of Commons, is housed in Paris's Bourbon Palace

Who was that? President Hollande frowns during an engagement at the nearby Elysee Palace today, right

Ms Gayet, 41, is seeking 50,000 Euros in damages from the magazine after saying the report, which included photos of Mr Hollande apparently leaving a Paris apartment where he met her on a scooter and wearing a full crash helmet, invaded her privacy.

French privacy laws are far stricter than those in the UK and French media traditionally ignore politicians' private lives.

Mr
 Hollande told reporters his 'indignation is total' over the magazine 
story, calling it a 'violation that touches a personal liberty.' He did not deny the claims made in the article.

Meanwhile France's first lady, Mr Hollande's partner Valerie Trierweiler, remains in hospital where she was taken after the affair was revealed.

Her
 spokesman Patrice Biancone said: 'I can tell you Madame Trierweiler is 
still in the hospital, and her doctors will determine when she can 
leave... She has six days of rest behind her - that counts, after all.

Affair: French magazine Closer has alleged the premier, pictured with his partner Valerie Trierweiler in October, had an affair with the actress Julie Gayet. Ms Gayet is suing the magazine for breach of privacy

The president reportedly arrived at a Paris apartment on his scooter to meet actress Julie Gayet (pictured)

'All visits have been forbidden ... except for the family - and even then, just her son.'

Mr Hollande's approval ratings are among the lowest of any French leader.

He has acknowledged 'painful moments' in his relationship with Trierweiler, and said the question of who the country's first lady is would be clarified before a state visit to the United States next month.

It is not the first protest using farmyard produce.

More than 2,500 angry farmers covered the streets of Brussels with milk and manure - bringing their cows with them - in protest at EU agricultural laws in 2009.

And comedians Heydon Prowse and Jolyon Rubinstein tried unsuccessfully to deliver a truckload of dung to Britain's Houses of Parliament last year for the BBC series The Revolution Will Be Televised - claiming politicians had 'run out of bulls***' and needed some more.
