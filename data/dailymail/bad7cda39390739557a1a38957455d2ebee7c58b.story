Authorities in London's Epping Forest have been stopping and searching walkers in an attempt to catch foragers who are stripping the woodland of fungi.

Forest keepers are trying to crack down on the harmful practice after gangs of foragers descended on the woodland in vans to cart away hauls of mushrooms which are then sold to restaurants.

The plants can fetch up to £50 per kilo as the trend for foraged food in upmarket restaurants in London and around the country has sent demand soaring. 

Forest keepers in Epping Forest have been frisking walkers using stop and search powers to crack down on foragers (pictured, one man was caught trying to take this haul of fungi out of the woods)

Last year 20 people were prosecuted for illegal mushroom picking in Epping Forest, and one man was caught trying to cart 20 bags of fungi out.

Forest bylaws prohibit taking anything from the woodland except small pieces of dead wood without the consent of authorities.

Forest keepers are attested constables, and so will likely be using Police and Criminal Evidence Act legislation which allows them to search people if they have reasonable suspicion a person is carrying something illegal.

The City of London corporation, which manages Epping Forest, is warning that removing huge amounts of the plants is damaging the forest and putting rare species under threat.

By-laws prohibit taking anything from forests without the consent of the authorities responsible for managing it.

Forest keepers are attested constables, and so are using Police and Criminal Evidence Act legislation, which allows them to stop and search anyone who they suspect is carrying anything illegal. 

The Epping Forest Act 1878, which passed control of the forest from the Royal family to the City of London Corporation, also allows forest keepers to stop and detain anyone they suspect of breaching by-laws.

In particular it is harming ancient trees, some of which are thought to be approaching 1000 years old, as particular types of fungus help to protect their roots. 

Jeremy Dagley, Epping Forest head of conservation, said: 'Epping Forest has 55,000 ancient trees, each centuries old, and like many plants they have a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which cover the roots and provide minerals in return for starches. 

'Around 80 per cent of the ancient beech trees in the country are in Epping Forest and we know their fungi are in trouble. 

'Stripping these fungi out on such a large scale can be ecologically damaging and is simply unsustainable.

'We are now seeing fungi foraging on an unprecedented scale.

'Commercial foragers are not selectively picking a few mushrooms for breakfast but hoovering up all fungi species in sight to sort later to sell at markets, restaurants and delis.'

Epping Forest, which is around 6,000 years old, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and used to be a Royal hunting ground before it was passed to the City of London corporation in 1878.

While other forests, such as the New Forest, have been hit by foragers, Epping has suffered particularly because of its links to London, meaning it can be easily accessed by millions of people via trains and tubes. 

Around 4.5million people visit the forest every year, according to the City of London Corporation. 

As well as damaging the forest, pickers are also putting themselves and diners at risk by harvesting everything they come across, including poisonous varieties.

Horse Whisperer author Nicholas Evans accidentally poisoned wife Charlotte Gordon Cumming and her brother after cooking foraged mushrooms, and all three eventually had to have kidney transplants

Nicholas Evans, the author of Horse Whisperer, infamously poisoned himself, his singer-songwriter wife Charlotte Gordon Cumming, and her brother Sir Alastair Gordon Cumming, after cooking mushrooms he foraged from Sir Alastair's Scottish estate.

But rather than the edible cep mushrooms he thought he had found, he actually cooked up deadly webcaps, putting all three of them in critical condition in hospital.

The poisoning was so acute that all three have since had to have kidney transplants.

According to the National Poisons Information Service almost 300 people fell ill after eating foraged mushrooms last year, many of them children under 10 who are more vulnerable to the toxins.

Dr John Thompson, Director of the NPIS unit in Cardiff, said: 'As the weather starts to change many people will soon be heading out to the countryside to seek out wild food which can be a really fun thing to do.

'But when it comes to wild mushrooms people need to be aware of the very real potential dangers involved, it is always at this time of year that we see a noticeable increase in poisoning cases.'

Chef René Redzepi began the fashion for foraging in 2003 when he opened two-Michelin starred restaurant Noma in Denmark.

The menu, which is made up of seasonal food foraged from the surrounding countryside, caused a revelation in the culinary world, and diners flocked in, with the waiting list for a table often stretching to three months or more.

The acclaimed eatery has also won Restaurant of the Year four times in the last five years, sparking imitators across the globe.

Rene Redzepi, and his Copenhagen restaurant Noma, began the trend for foraging when it opened in 2003. The two-Michelin starred eatery spawned hundreds of imitators across the world

In Britain chefs such as Tim Maddams, who used to work at River Cottage alongside Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Mark Lloyd, and Simon Rogan all promote foraging through cookbooks and their restaurants, meaning the trend is growing.

Lone foragers are largely only a risk to themselves, often picking and eating poisonous varieties without realising, which can cause deaths in rare circumstances.

However the booming demand for foraged food has driven up wholesale prices, with a kilo of mushrooms now worth around £50.

That means big business for anyone who can haul enough of the precious fungi away from woodlands around the country.

In 2013 one man was caught trying to take 20 sacks of mushrooms from Epping Forest, while another 19 were prosecuted for running similar schemes.

Forest keepers  are warning that such large scale operations are wrecking some of our oldest and most precious woodlands, and putting rare species at risk.
