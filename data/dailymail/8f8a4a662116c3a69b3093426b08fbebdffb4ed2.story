A two-timing cheat with a very short temper decided to go on Dr. Phil to decide if he should leave his wife for his mistress, and let the two ladies meet for the first time.

Melvin is married to Rachel, but while the two were separated he began dating Chantelle.

That was two years ago, and now Melvin spends his time flip flopping between the two women, who have somehow fallen under his spell.

Over it: Melvin's wife Rachel (above) just wants him to make a decision so she can move on with her life

Other woman: Chantelle (above) is the mistress who has been with Melvin for two years

These days, Melvin is living with Chantelle, and his wife Rachel just wants to know what he wants to do with his life so she can finally move on with hers.

Rachel also has little tolerance for the woman who stayed with her husband as they tried to work on their relationship.

'It’s disgusting to me,' she tells Chantelle. 

'I don’t see how someone could do that. If she knows we were trying to work things out, she should be a woman and back away.'

It is also revealed that Rachel alleges that she got two STDs from her husband.

Melvin meanwhile is frequently annoyed and put off that the audience keeps laughing as he portrays himself as a victim of love, unsure of what to do.

At one point he even storms off stage, with Chantelle quickly running after him.

Called out: Dr. Phil cannot understand why either woman is with Melvin

When asked why everyone keeps laughing at him, Dr. Phil is kind enough to explain, saying; 'They’re laughing because it’s ridiculous. They’re laughing because of your absolute and utter lack of insight and narcissistic, self-serving sh*t is more than they can take.' 

He then adds, 'And that should be a huge wake-up call to you.'

Chantelle meanwhile claims she just wants Melvin to be loved, and says that Rachel treats him horribly whenever they get back together.

Dr. Phil informs her she does not get an opinion on the matter as she is an 'interlooper' in the relationship. 

In the end however, Dr. Phil explains to Chantelle, 'If he cheats on his wife he's going to cheat on you.'

As for Melvin, it seems like Rachel may have finally had enough, and he and the mistress certainly seem to deserve one another. 

Melvin and Chantelle end the show next to one another, though it is still not clear who he is with now.
