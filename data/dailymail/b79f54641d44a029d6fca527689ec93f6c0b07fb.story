The mother of Cherice Moralez has rejected the apology of the Montana judge who sentenced her rapist teacher to 30 days in jail - saying he's 'only covering his butt.'

Auliea Hanlon said District Judge Todd Baugh’s apology was 'irrelevant' because he has stood by the sentence given to rapist and former teacher Stacey Rambold, even though Cherice was only 14 when he had sex with her.

Some 400 protestors turned out in front of the Yellowstone County courthouse on Thursday afternoon and demanded that Judge Baugh resign, that Rambold's sentence be reviewed and that the judge's past cases be looked over for similar outrageous rulings.

'Covering his butt': Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's mother criticized the judge's apology as 'meaningless' because the 30 day sentence for her daughter's rapist teacher still stood

Outrage: About 400 protestors showed up to demand that Judge Todd Baugh resign after making offensive statements about a teenage rape victim who killed herself

They were furious about both her sentence and the words the judge used when handing it down on Monday. After reviewing police interviews with Cherice, he said, he was convince that she was 'as much in control' of the sexual relationship as the teacher - despite being 35 years older than the student. He also said that the crime was mitigated by the fact that the girl was 'older than her chronological age.'

On Wednesday, the 66-year-old judge apologized for his words - but not his actions. He stood by sending Rambold to jail for a month - despite allegations that he used his position at Billings Senior High School to groom troubled Cherice for sex in 2008.

While the case was still pending, she killed herself. Ms Hanlon says Rambold's sexual relationship with her daughter was a 'major factor' in the suicide.

Prosecutors carried signs like 'Justice for Cherice' and '14 is 14.' Another poster said simply 'Stop. You're Embarrassing Us.'

Organizer Sheena Rice told the Billings Gazette that Judge Baugh's decision is not an isolated incident.

Protestors said the judge's words are part of a bigger problem of victim blaming in rape cases

'Bad form': Judge Baugh is running for reelection next year. Protestors vowed to ensure he doesn't receive a fifth term

'Resign!' Angry community members called for the judge to step down - though he has shown no sign of doing so

'It really points to a larger problem of victim blaming in rape cases across the country,' she said.

'To see it happen in Billings, it's time we as a community take a stand against victim blaming.'

The judge at the center of a firestorm for handing a 30-day sentence to a teacher who repeatedly raped a 14-year-old who went onto kill herself had a history of controversial decisions.

MailOnline can reveal today that Judge G Todd Baugh's latest decision is to be reviewed, as protesters take to the streets of the Montana 
town outraged at the short sentence and the judge's criticism of the innocent victim.

In Billings District Court, Yellowstone, the judge implied that Stacey Rambold's victim, Cherice Moralez, was ‘in control of the situation’ and outraged her anguished mother, Auliea Hanlon, with his view that Cherice was ‘older than her chronological years.’

Teacher: Rambold, 54, lost his house, his job, his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges. His lawyer suggested, and the judge seemed to agree on Monday, that he had been 'punished enough'

Now, Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito has said that his office is seeking legal cause to appeal the sentence in which Rambold, who plead guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent, saw all but 30 days of a 15 year term suspended.

Cherry, who was 14 when Rambold had a sexual relationship with her in 2008, committed suicide in 2010, as the case made its way through the courts.

Speaking to the Billings Gazette County Attorney Scott Twito expressed his frustration and admitted: ‘I can’t instantly appeal this.

‘I have no legal authority in Montana whatsoever to appeal a sentence because I disagree with the sentence handed down by the judge.’

But he said: ‘We will review this matter, as we do all matters, as the judgement is prepared.’

Mr Twito’s office has received what he described as ‘hate emails’  following reports that his office would not review the Rambold sentence for a possible appeal.

District Judge Baugh, who has defended his decision, is currently writing an addendum to the court file explaining his reasons for the sentence.

Meanwhile School District Superintendent Terry Bouck has issued a statement saying that he disagrees with the sentence imposed.

Anguish: Cherry's mother spoke about how the teen was stunned and bullied after her attacker was charged

Noting that the school district’s involvement with the case ‘ended several years ago,' with the payment of a $91,000 wrongful death settlement to Cherice Moralez’s mother, Auliea Hanlon, Mr Bouck said: ‘What Mr Rambold did when he was a teacher was repugnant and inexcusable.

‘While I respect the court system, I disagree with the sentence, and I believe Mr Rambold deserves to spend more time in jail than 30 days.’

The news comes as ABC 7 reports the state's Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education criticized District Judge Baugh for last month dismissing what would have been a woman's 13th conviction for driving under the influence.

The judge reportedly handed her a three-year suspended sentence for felony criminal endangerment, but the commissioner of higher education said the 'most shocking' thing about the case was the judge's comments to the women: 'If you drink and drive and kill someone, you will spend some real time in prison.'

However District Judge Baugh has previously imposed tough rape sentences, including ordering a 26-year-old man who raped an 11-year-old boy to serve 100 years in prison.

District Judge Baugh has reportedly served as a judge in Yellowstone County since 1984. He was an attorney in Billings and served as a U.S. magistrate before running for district court judge, according to ABC 7.
