Blockbuster author Wilbur Smith admits that his success has cost him a close relationship with his three children.

The millionaire, 81, pictured, who has a jet-set lifestyle with five homes, said: ‘It’s all about the money.

‘And if they feel they’re not getting a fair share of what they think should be theirs, that’s bad luck to them.’

The author said his children were only interested in his money and had never earned his respect

In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, he insisted: ‘You just have to laugh it off.’

Smith has blamed his devotion to penning 31 novels for damaging his relationship with sons Shaun and Kawrence and daughter Christian. Previously she has accused him of neglect and stinginess.

But now he says of the offspring of his first two marriages: ‘I think it’s because they did nothing to win my respect.’

Smith’s third wife Danielle Thomas died of cancer in 1999 and he married Mokhiniso Rakhimova, 39 years his junior, a year later.

The write is pictured with his daughter Christian and son Shaun when they were children. Wilbur has been married four times
