At the end of his country’s disastrous Euro 2012 campaign in Ukraine, Arjen Robben hinted at familiar problems that seem to have been around Dutch football almost as long as their famous orange shirts.

‘If you want to accomplish something together, you have to put egos aside,’ said the Holland winger. ‘You have to fight as a team to regain that sense of invincibility. It won’t come by itself.’

Holland lost all three group games two years ago. After having been World Cup finalists two years previously, Bert van Marwijk’s team fell apart quickly and the common conception was that familiar failings had done for them again.

Leaders: Robben and van Persie have taken on the roles of responsibility in the Dutch setup under van Gaal

Flying Dutchman: van Persie, who scored brilliantly against Spain, has flourished in Brazil so far

Here in Brazil, they will tell you it is different. They will tell you that Louis van Gaal’s squad finally understand the value of unity and that Robben has played an integral part — along with Robin van Persie.

Van Persie, who will return to the side after suspension for tomorrow’s last 16 tie against Mexico, is Van Gaal’s captain while Robben is the understudy.

A decision made by Van Gaal on taking the job, it says something that the two men he stood down, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, remain integral and uncomplaining members of the squad.

Anyone who saw Kuyt running himself into the ground at left back against Chile earlier this week will have noticed evidence of ongoing commitment.

Relationship: Manager and captain are extremely close in the Holland camp, with each quick to praise the other

Man-management: van Gaal has also brought the best out of Robben as the two stars lead their team

At the more glamorous point of the team, Van Persie and Robben are writing their names all over this World Cup.

Neither player has always been easy to handle. David Moyes struggled to hit the right note with the Manchester United striker while Robben was viewed as a shirker during his years with Chelsea.

‘Arjen Faint Heart’, was Jose Mourinho’s sobriquet for him.

If Holland are to progress deeper into this tournament, though, it is clear that both players will be very influential.

Those who follow the team closely say the responsibility of leadership has brought the best out of them.

Van 
Persie’s bond with Van Gaal is clear, illustrated perfectly by the 
rather clumsy but genuine high five the two men exchanged after the 
United striker’s diving header against Spain two weeks ago.

‘If we do well here it will be because of the coach,’ said Van Persie.

Robben, meanwhile, is said to have 
matured somewhat since his days in England. He has married his long-term
 girlfriend, is an ambassador for his first club, Groningen, and is 
involved in a project to encourage young Dutch children to read more.

Meaningful: It may have been slightly clumsy but this high five showed the unity in the Dutch camp

Wonder-strike: Robben has been excellent in the group stages, including scoring this solo goal

But then maybe the reason for Van Gaal’s successful nurturing of his two best players is more simple.

Van Persie and Robben both have egos to match their abundant gifts. They have long seen themselves as the two most important figures in the Dutch squad so what better way to channel that positively than by handing them the responsibilities of leadership?

Willing: Dirk Kuyt has shown himself more than happy to be part of the team despite losing the vice-captaincy

This is a Dutch squad that is gifted but also flawed. Holland look vulnerable through the middle of their defence.

Australia gave them a scare in their second group game and against Spain in game one they could have been two or three down before turning the game spectacularly on its head.

In the centre of midfield, Nigel de Jong can appear one-paced and has looked like a walking red card at times.

So Holland need to function fully up front if they are to prosper. Van Gaal seems to have got the balance right so far.
