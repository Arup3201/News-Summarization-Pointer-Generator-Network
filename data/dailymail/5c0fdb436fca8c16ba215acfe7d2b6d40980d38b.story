Casey Kasem's wife has fought back against his children by filing court papers in which she accuses his daughter of wanting to give the star's fortune to the Church of Scientology.

Jean Kasem, 59, has also accused Kerri Kasem, 41, of owing her and her husband $1.3m and filed a doctor's letter which disputes claims the 82-year-old broadcast icon's condition had worsened.

Kerri Kasem has asked a judge to let her move her terminally-ill father to a nursing home in Los Angeles, just days after taking custody of him from his second wife Jean.

Kasem, 82, is said to be suffering from a form of dementia and can no longer care for himself

Since May 6, his wife Jean had been 
caring for him at a friend's house outside Seattle, Washington. He was 
removed on Sunday after a judge awarded Kerri temporary custody of her 
father.

Jean Kasem has now 
accused Kerri Kasem of wanting to donate her father's fortune to the 
Church of Scientology, in documents submitted to Kitsap Superior Court, NBC News has reported.

Kerri
 Kasem yesterday denied being a member of the Church of Scientology and 
borrowing money from her father as she described the claims as a 
'defamation of character'.

Casey
 Kasem's condition is not known, but Kerri Kasem said in court on 
Friday that her father is suffering from bedsores and lung and bladder 
infections. She has also said her father has a form of dementia.

A
 letter from a doctor has been included in the papers filed by Jean 
Kasem which disputes the claims his condition had worsened since she 
moved him from a facility in Santa Monica to Washington.

In a court filing, Kerri Kasem said her father needs the attention of skilled nursing care.

Doctors say he has only six months to live and is afflicted with Lewy Body dementia.

Kasem's friends and his children from his
 first marriage have been battling Jean Kasem over custody of Casey 
Kasem after she allegedly cut off access to him several months ago.

A Kitsap County judge ruled Friday that Kerri Kasem could have a doctor 
of her choosing examine her father.
