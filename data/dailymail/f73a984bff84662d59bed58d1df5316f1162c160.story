The hemorrhage came as a shock to the family as Sigler was of good health up until then, said a source. 

'Adam was always so happy and inspired Jamie to be a better person every day,' a source told the site. 'She loved him dearly and will miss him more than anyone can ever imagine.'

The insider added, 'The family was with him every second he was in a coma and was surrounded by his entire family when he passed.'
