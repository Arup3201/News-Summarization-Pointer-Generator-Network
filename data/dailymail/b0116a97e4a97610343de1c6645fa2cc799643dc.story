Marbles that once belonged to the world's most famous Holocaust victim - teenaged diarist Anne Frank - have turned up over seventy years after she gave them to a friend for safekeeping before she and her family went into hiding.

Anne never lived to reclaim the marbles. After hiding in an attic with her family they were betrayed to the Nazis, arrested and shipped off to concentration camps.Â  She died in the Bergen-Belsen camp early in 1945.

The Anne Frank House Museum in Amsterdam reported this week that Anne's tin of marbles has been handed to it and went on display for the first time on Tuesday at an art gallery in Rotterdam.

Shortly before Anne Frank and her family went into hiding from the Nazis, she gave away some of her toys to non-Jewish neighborhood girlfriend Toosje Kupers for safekeeping

The neighbour, Toosje Kupers, kept the marbles along with a tea set and a book.

The now 83-year-old Kupers told a Dutch broadcaster that after World War II ended she had offered the items to Otto Frank, Anne's father and the only member of the family to survive the Holocaust.

She said Anne's father, who returned to the secret attic where they hid from the Germans in 1942 to find her now-famous diary, told her she could keep the marbles.

For years, the tin box with the marbles remained in a cupboard, and were only discovered again during a recent house move.

The items are on display in an exhibit on World War II in Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum.

Museum spokeswoman Annemarie Bekkers said that Frank was one of many Jewish children who gave away toys before being deported and dying in the Holocaust.

Anne Frank wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II.

The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from Germany in 1933.

By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped.

In 1942 the family went into hiding in the hidden rooms of Otto Frank's office building

But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945.

Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame.
