Temperatures are set to plummet as much as 40 degrees in a single day in parts of the United States - with as much as a foot of snow also due to fall in an onrush of wintry weather.

The Upper Midwest will be hit first by the frigid weather system from the north, which is being pushed in by the remnants of a freezing typhoon which hit Alaska over the weekend.

Montana and the Dakotas were hit by three inches of snow Sunday - and now the flurries have pushed further east into Minnesota and Wisconsin, where they will dump up to 12 inches of snow in coming days.

Bringer of winter: Typhoon Nuri, which struck Alaska over the weekend and is now dissipating over the Bering Sea, between Alaska and Russia, has driven blasts of cold air over North America. It was pictured above by a Nasa satellite on November 5

The north-most parts of the country will be hit by temperatures well below freezing Monday, with the highest prediction in Great Falls, Montana, just 17 degrees. The normal temperature for mid-November is 43.

The forecast for Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is a high of 25, which is about 20 degrees below normal. High temperatures in Minneapolis will only reach the upper 20s.

'We're kind of getting locked in winter's grip here,' said Troy Kleffmen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota.

Other states will be hit by snowfall in the coming days too, according to the service. Predictions said some snow would hit Wyoming, Idaho, Maine and upstate New York Monday.

Flurries will continue through the week, with falls in Colorado, Nebraska and north-east Illinois Tuesday morning.

By Friday morning snow will be falling over all of New England, most of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as the vast majority of New York state, stopping just short of New York City.

A new burst of snow is predicted for the center of the country late Saturday, hitting Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Indiana and northern parts of Texas.

National Weather Service meteorologist Gino Izzi in Chicago warned that city will be hit by wintry weather sooner than usual too.

He said highs are expected to settle into the 30s from Tuesday through Friday, while nightly lows could drop into the 20s, perhaps even the teens.

'It doesn't look real promising for a warmup after that, either,' he added.

Coming to the north-east: By Friday morning, snows to the east will have spread across all of New England, Michigan and most of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. New York state will be hit, but New York City spared

The  weather is part of a system being pushed in by the remnants of Typhoon Nuri that hit Alaska's Aleutian Islands with hurricane-strength winds over the weekend.

That storm is expected to lose strength as it passes into the Bering Sea, but forecasters warned it will still push unseasonably frigid air into much of the U.S. this week.

When the storm, which has been dubbed the Bering Bomb on social media, hit Alaksa it was even more intense than Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the north-east of the country in 2012. But Nuri did much less damage as it hit remote areas where people are used to extreme weather. 

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has not predicted a repeat of last winter, where air from the polar vortex froze huge swathes of the country.  

However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration isn't expecting a repeat of the 2013-2014 season. Federal forecasters predicted last month that this winter will be fairly average without a lot of extreme conditions such as last year's Arctic influx from the polar vortex.

Central U.S.: Saturday night and early Sunday morning will also bring snowfall to the center of the country, hitting states such as Nebraska, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and the northern tip of Texas

The Midwest's cold weather is expected to bring a host of travel delays.Delta Airlines said the new falls could affect flights to and from Wisconsin and Minnesota.

Driving could also become difficult in storm-hit areas - but locals, who put up with the weather most every year, are not worried. 

Even though South Dakota rancher Roger Weiss lives 35 miles from the nearest town, Faith - with a population of less than 450 people - and 70 miles from a grocery store, in Sturgis, he said the coming snow generally doesn't worry him.

'Roads are generally good, a lot of times they're blowed clean,' he said.
