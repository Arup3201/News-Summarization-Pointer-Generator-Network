Split: Paul Hollywood confirmed he has split from wife Alexandra. The couple have an 11-year-old son

By rights, this should be a time of celebration for Paul Hollywood. After all, it is not every week your new TV show airs on one of America’s biggest networks.

And the Wirral-born celebrity baker has long harboured hopes of carving out the U.S. fame to match his showbiz surname.

Yet, instead of toasting his success, Hollywood cut a tortured figure this week as he sat slumped behind the wheel of his flashy Aston Martin sports car in a Kent village, his head in his hands.

As he arrived back at his 13th-century marital home for ‘crisis’ talks with his estranged wife Alexandra, he bore the haunted look of someone who has come, belatedly, to the realisation he faces losing everything he’s strived for.

Gone is the carefree demeanour he displayed when appearing alongside Marcela Valladolid, the beautiful chef he is said to have become close to on the U.S. version of The Great British Bake Off, which debuted on U.S. TV on Wednesday night.

The show’s producers had been doing much to trumpet the pair’s supposed on-screen sexual chemistry, with promos showing the doll-like Miss Valladolid, 34, licking her lips and gazing at her British co-star, 47.

Yet reviews of the first episode have criticised the pair for lacking any spark.

This must be mildly cheering for Alexandra, 49, the mother of Hollywood’s son Josh, 11, whom the chef walked out on last month amid rumours about his friendship with American-born Marcela.

Alexandra has taken off her wedding ring and is said to be demanding a divorce from Hollywood, who has moved into a flat close to the home they shared in Wingham, Kent.

Which might explain why Hollywood looks so worried. 

He has good reason to be concerned. Despite the belated public backing of his BBC bosses this week, his long-term future on The Great British Bake Off remains in jeopardy following a backlash from his once-smitten female fans.

At the same time, he may face being financially crippled if his wife follows through with her threat of ending the marriage. 

For Hollywood’s part, sources on his BBC2 show say he is desperate for a reconciliation with his wife — and has turned to co-star Mary Berry for help winning her back.

New clues suggest the pair’s marriage was stable until recently. A month before the split, the bread-maker turned showbiz personality set up a new business to funnel his growing television and media earnings.

Significantly, he appointed Alexandra to the role of company secretary when launching PJH Media Limited on March 7 this year.

According to records at Companies House, the husband and wife are the only shareholders in the firm, which has its registered office in a terrace of commercial properties in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. 

Alexandra was already the secretary of his only other business, Paul Hollywood Limited, which was first registered as a company in July 2004. 

And business is booming. As well as his six-figure BBC salary and a similar fee for the U.S. counterpart, his bestselling book Paul Hollywood’s Bread, released in March to coincide with a spin-off TV series, has pushed the baker’s earnings close to  £1.5million in the past year. 

Accountants say that, even after a divorce, Alexandra would be under no obligation to resign her position, which, importantly, gives her a half share in the new company’s profits.

The fact Hollywood appointed her to the role so recently signposts how quickly the relationship broke down.

The new firm was set up just a week before Hollywood flew off to Georgia in the U.S. to film for two months with former pastry chef Miss Valladolid, a divorced mother-of-one. By the time he returned, his marriage was over.

Now Alexandra is said to be talking to lawyers, which could include walking away with her share of the couple’s assets, which include their £800,000, grade I-listed home. 

Certainly, no one can deny that blonde Alexandra, whom Hollywood met when he was working as a baker at a hotel in Cyprus in the Nineties, has been there alongside him every step of the way as he rose to fame.

She helped him set up his successful bread-making business, based in Aylesham, Kent, which supplies Harrods and Waitrose.

Firm friends: Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood have been good friends since they met eight years ago

He then landed his role in The Great British Bake Off, alongside judge Mary Berry, in 2010.

And it is to 78-year-old Mrs Berry he has turned, in the hope of salvaging his marriage — and reputation. 

Friends say he is hoping Mary, with whom he started filming the fourth series of the British show in Somerset this month, will act as a go-between in his bid to win Alexandra back.

And Mary, who regularly puts up her co-judge at the Buckinghamshire home she shares with her husband of 47 years, Paul Hunnings, is believed to be keen to help, offering to telephone Alexandra to push Hollywood’s case.

The two couples, who have known each other since Berry and Hollywood appeared on a satellite food channel in 2005, have been regular dinner companions and Alexandra describes Mary as ‘wonderful’

But Mrs Hollywood will have been unimpressed when the grand dame of baking defended Hollywood to friends last week, saying: ‘You can’t blame him, things happen and boys will be boys.’

What is undeniable is that Hollywood’s problems might all be solved if his wife were to take him back. Hollywood, who revels in the soubriquet ‘the George Clooney of baking’, has been stung by the backlash from one-time devotees on Twitter and other social media.

The BBC reacted to claims members of the production team want him dropped from the series for damaging its ‘wholesome’ image by announcing his job was safe

Mary has hinted she would quit if he got the chop.

But sources at the Corporation say it would have been nigh on impossible to replace him for the current series because filming had started when news of his marriage split and alleged affair broke earlier this month.

And executives who have been in touch with Bake Off’s executive producer Richard McKerrow have refused to give private assurances to Hollywood he will still have a job once this series has aired this summer.

Only recently, the chef, who worked as head baker at The Dorchester Hotel in London, had been talking about his hopes he would still be making the show in 15 years’ time.

He is said by friends to refer to his role as judge and its lucrative spin-offs as the ‘family silver’.

With Miss Valladolid on the other side of the Atlantic, clearly Hollywood’s thoughts have turned back to the devoted Alexandra, who until recently had talked lovingly on Twitter of cooking him his favourite steak flambé with prunes, cream and Stilton.

So far, she is said to have rebuffed his attempts at a reconciliation. I am told she took soundings from her closest girlfriends at a spa day to celebrate her birthday earlier this month.

Some friends are adamant she should refuse to take him back.

Meanwhile, members of the crew on the set of the U.S. version told the Mail how Miss Valladolid and Hollywood retired to a shared trailer between takes.

While the show’s host Jeff Foxworthy had his motor home close to the set, theirs was, say production staff, partitioned into ‘his and hers’ quarters.

Hollywood and Miss Valladolid also stayed at the same Marriott hotel while on location.

It is clear they got on like a house on fire judging by the photos of them posing together they posted on Twitter and her description of him as a ‘handsome devil’.

However, Miss Valladolid has made it plain she has no intention of coming to Britain and has set her sights on becoming the most famous female chef in the U.S.

According to sources, she would also not want to take her nine-year-son Fausto out of the school he attends near her home San Diego, California.

She is divorced from the boy’s father, after whom he is named, Mexican politician Fausto Gallardo.

Last year, the couple had a brief reconciliation, during which she described her ex as her ‘Latin-loving-rodeo-riding-sexy-as-hell-husband’ However, she and Gallardo split again before she met Hollywood.

Miss Valladolid, who trained as a chef in LA and Paris, started her own catering company in Tijuana, Mexico, and later created a brand of tequila. 

Meanwhile, former colleagues in Cyprus are raising knowing eyebrows at talk of Hollywood’s travails.

By all accounts, he was known for having an ‘eye for the ladies’ during his time working at the five-star Anassa and Annabelle hotels on the island.

At the time, rumours flew around the expat community that he was being followed around by two besotted local girls even after meeting Kent-born Alexandra, who was working there as a scuba diving instructor.

One British chef, who was a guest at the couple’s wedding on Cyprus in 1998, said: ‘Paul was focused on his work.

'He was a brilliant baker. He helped open three hotels and worked incredibly hard. I never once saw him on the beach. It’s hard on your social life, but Paul was always popular.’ 

Judging by his effect on Miss Valladolid, not much has changed.

The question is whether Hollywood can work his charms on his devastated wife — and rescue his shaky career.
