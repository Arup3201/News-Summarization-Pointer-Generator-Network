Charlotte Church waived a £100,000 fee to sing at Rupert Murdoch’s wedding in return for favourable coverage in his newspapers, she claimed yesterday.

However, the singer says she was betrayed by the media tycoon, whose publications she claims have attacked her throughout her career.

Miss Church, 25, said she was persuaded by her media advisers to waive the fee to perform at Mr Murdoch’s wedding to Wendi Deng in 1999.

Testimony: Charlotte Church today described how she was hounded by the Press throughout her teenage years

Deal: The singer waived a £100,000 fee in exchange for good publicity from Rupert Murdoch's newspapers

In an illustration of her childhood 
innocence – she was just 13 at the time – she said she had wanted to 
take the £100,000 and spend it on Tamagotchi toys, the digital pets 
which were a craze at the time.

In her witness statement to the 
Leveson Inquiry into press standards, she said: ‘Despite my teenage 
business head screaming, 'Think how many Tamagotchies you could buy!!'

Mr Murdoch with Wendi Deng on their wedding day. He reportedly offered Miss Church good coverage in his papers if she gave up a £100,000 charge to sing at the reception

'I was pressured into taking the 
latter option.

'This strategy failed... for me. In fact Mr Murdoch’s 
newspapers have since been some of the worst offenders, so much so that I
have sometimes felt that there has actually been a deliberate agenda.’

The inquiry heard that Mr Murdoch’s 
company News International denied there had been any such deal, and that
Miss Church was booked as a surprise performer, without the tycoon’s 
knowledge.

But she replied that Mr Murdoch had personally insisted she should sing Pie Jesu, despite her pointing out it was a funeral requiem – and said she flew to New York on his private jet for the wedding.

Miss Church told the inquiry that her childhood fame made her a ‘bankable commodity’ and exposed her to appalling psychological pressures.

She said her overnight success as the ‘Voice of an Angel’ when she was just 11 had warped her childhood and meant she was hunted by paparazzi for years, with newspapers determined to portray her as a ‘fallen angel’.

The former child star was catapulted to fame after she performed Pie Jesu on a television gameshow in 1997.

Witness: Ms Church leaving the inquiry with her legal team

She said her fame exposed her to illegal phone hacking, blackmail attempts and kidnap plots.

It left her unable to enjoy normal 
relationships as a teenager, she said, and her first two serious 
boyfriends both sold intimate stories about her.

At 15, a tabloid newspaper ran a 
‘predatory’ clock on its website, she said, counting down the days to 
her 16th birthday when she would reach the legal age for sex.

Intrusion: Anne Diamond spoke at the Leveson Inquiry about the funeral of her baby son where a photographer took pictures that then appeared on the front page of The Sun

Miss Church told the inquiry her 
family had suffered because of her fame and suggested that press 
intrusion had contributed to her mother’s suicide attempt.

Maria Church tried to kill herself in
2005 after she discovered the News of the World was about to publish a 
story that her husband was addicted to cocaine and having an affair.

Miss Church said: ‘It was totally 
sensationalised. Whether partially or wholly true, I just really hated 
the fact that my parents, who had never been in this industry apart from
in taking care of me, were being exposed and vilified in this fashion.’

Her career was damaged by some of the negative coverage, she said, including a Sunday Times article which claimed she had denigrated the work of New York firefighters after the September 11 atrocity.

Miss Church insisted she was misquoted and that her record company was forced to hire guards to protect her in the U.S. as a result.

The singer accepted she had received positive publicity at the start of her career and that she had sold interviews and photo-shoots to magazines including Hello! and OK! 

But she claimed the deals were her attempt to decrease the demand for paparazzi pictures of her and her two children from her relationship with her former fiancé, Welsh rugby international Gavin Henson.

The former TV-am presenter also claimed The Sun had infiltrated the hospital where she was giving birth by impersonating a doctor

The inquiry also heard from TV 
presenter Anne Diamond, who claimed she was the victim of a 20-year 
vendetta by the Murdoch empire.

She suggested the tycoon had taken 
revenge against her after she interviewed him in the 1980s and 
‘precociously’ told him his newspapers ‘seemed to be intent on ruining 
some people’s lives’.

The former TV-am presenter claimed The Sun had infiltrated the hospital where she was giving birth by impersonating a doctor.

Miss Diamond said the paper also 
published a front-page picture of her and her then husband carrying the 
coffin of their baby son Sebastian at his funeral in 1991, after his cot
death.

Christopher Jefferies, 66, told the inquiry he was ¿shamelessly vilified¿ and had to change his appearance and live 'a hole and corner' existence after police arrested him on suspicion of her murder

The landlord of murdered Joanna Yeates told yesterday how he was the victim of a ‘frenzied’ newspaper campaign to convince the public of his guilt.

Christopher Jefferies, 66, said he was ‘shamelessly vilified’ and had to change his appearance and live ‘a hole and corner’ existence after police arrested him on suspicion of her murder.

He told the Leveson Inquiry that his normal life was suspended as he moved from one safe-house to another until police stopped proceedings against him in March this year.

Vincent Tabak, 33, was eventually arrested and convicted of the murder of the 25-year-old, who went missing on December 17 and was found dead on Christmas Day.

Mr Jefferies told the inquiry: ‘The Press set about what can only be described as a witch-hunt.

‘The tabloid Press decided that I was guilty of Miss Yeates’s murder and seemed determined to persuade the public of my guilt.

‘They embarked on a frenzied  campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue, allegations which were a mixture of smear, innuendo and complete fiction.’

Mr Jefferies was released on police bail until January 1, 2011 – but his friends and lawyers advised him not to go out and not to read newspaper articles about him for his ‘psychological health’.

Eight national newspapers made public apologies to Mr Jefferies in July for libellous allegations made against him.

The titles – The Sun, Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, Daily Record, Daily Mail, Daily Star, The Scotsman and Daily Express – have also agreed to pay him substantial libel damages, thought to total six figures.
