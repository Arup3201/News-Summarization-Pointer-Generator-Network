Davide Santon might be forgiven for inviting the advances of AC Milan and escaping the Premier League - for his last five matches have returned an aggregate score of 0-18.

The Newcastle United defender returns to the English top flight this weekend after eight months of painstaking rehab doing the 9-5 shift at the club’s training ground in a bid to overcome a lingering knee injury.

During that time there has been interest in the former Inter Milan full back from their San Siro rivals, but Santon - given his Nerazzurri debut by Jose Mourinho - is instead targeting a new deal on Tyneside.

‘I am happy here - I still have one and a half years left on my contract and I will probably have to speak to Newcastle soon,’ he said. ‘I’ve always said I am happy here.’

Before being struck down by injury in April of last season, however, Santon and his team-mates were far from happy.

They were in the midst of a six-match losing run and boss Alan Pardew was coming under increasing pressure from the terraces.

A 4-0 defeat at home by Manchester United would prove to be Santon's last outing for the man who brought him to St James’ Park for £5million in 2011.

Before that, the Italy international had himself come in for criticism. Indeed, his previous four matches had returned 4-0 losses against Southampton and Spurs and 3-0 reverses at the hands of Chelsea and Sunderland. The last time he played in a side which scored was in January of last season during a 3-1 win at West Ham United.

Santon, though, says he is returning a stronger player for the pain of the past 12 months.

‘I have come back stronger. I've been training hard for six months now and have been finishing at 5pm every day,’ he said.

‘That is making me stronger. But now I just want to play - for my fitness and for myself. I am only 24 years old.

‘But it has been difficult. My family helped me a lot - my fiancee and my baby and my mum and my dad - it was important to have all of those people around me. If you are by yourself, it's difficult. It has been a long time.’

Santon was always a favourite under Pardew but must now set about proving himself to a new boss and winning back his place in the team, lost to academy graduate Paul Dummett.

He added: ‘Now, for me, the competition is not a problem. I'm used to that. I had a good time with Pardew when he was here, and I wish him good luck.

‘Now we have to go on to the next page and start a new chapter.’

Santon is no doubt relieved to close the book on what was a depressing 2014.
