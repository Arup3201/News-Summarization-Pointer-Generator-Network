Bayern Munich's first team stars have stepped up their preparations for the second half of the season by taking part in a warm weather training session at Doha's Aspire Academy. 

Pep Guardiola's side flew to the Middle East on Friday in order to take advantage of the Bundesliga's winter break.

Bayern will take on a Qatar Stars League XI and Al-Hilal during their time in Asia before facing VfL Bochum in a friendly match ahead of their next Bundesliga fixture on January 30.

Guardiola, who has scheduled two workouts per day in Doha, put his side through their paces on Saturday.

The likes of Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Manuel Neuer were among the players who were made to sweat in the humid conditions during the first day of the Volkswagen training camp.

It was not all hard work for Bayern's stars however, as they were allowed to meet local fans - with Holger Badstuber even taking a selfie with a young boy.

Spanish tactician Guardiola will be hoping his side can replicate their early season form when they return to Germany.

Bayern have won 14 out of a possible 17 league games and remain unbeaten in the Bundesliga so far this season.
