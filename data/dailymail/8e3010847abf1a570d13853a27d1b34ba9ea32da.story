A man has made his adorable pet cat the star of a series of surreal images. 

Jesus Segura, 38, a former cameraman, used a mix of sets, green screen and photoshop to imagine the tiny kitten in unusual scenes.

These range from sipping a beer at the bar to escaping the clutches of a giant squid.

After watching the amusing moggy's face as it explored new areas and objects of his flat, Jesus soon noticed his ability to seemingly express a wide range of emotions.

Here escaping the clutches of a giant squid, Napoleon the cat is captured in a variety of bizarre locations in the photos 

The dramatic  squid scene was in fact created rather simply against a mini green screen 

But the American Persian cat is more to the Spaniard than a fun photography project: he's helped him keep busy and stay positive after being made redundant from his job at a Spanish TV network.

Jesus is now on a mission to get the fluffy kitten's face seen all around the world after creating calenders and postcards of Napoleon on crowd funding site, Indiegogo.

Jesus said: 'When I first got Napoleon he was only a two months, everything was new for him, every daily detail was a discovery.

Jesus says the kitten's natural expressions lend themselves to a variety of odd scenarios 

'Watching him I thought, what if he could experience fantastic or absurd situations, so that was my starting point.

'Since the beginning he always had very expressive reactions, when he's tired he almost looks angry and when he's relaxed his eyebrows make him look sad.

'The images are half real and half digital, at first I draw a basic sketch of the image I want to create and then I make a list of real things I need for the set.

'I worked as a cameraman for 12 years, but a year and a half ago, the TV network I was working for fired 900 workers.

'I felt desperate and unfortunately found myself with too much free time so I began taking pictures of Napoleon as a way of filling my free time.

'Napoleon is so curious, that's why I never let him on each set until I am ready to take the photos, his first reactions on set are the most amusing.

'Everybody loves the pictures and they always ask me if Napoleon's expressions are real but believe me, all his gestures are completely real.'
