Manchester United made a last-ditch bid for Ajax keeper Kenneth Vermeer.

Ajax have agreed to sell Vermeer to their Eredivisie rivals Feyenoord for a reported fee of around £600,000.

However, United tried to strike a deal at the end of last week for the 28-year-old but Vermeer said he had given his word to Feyenoord.

Louis van Gaal is a fan of Vermeer, who would provide cover for No 1 keeper David de Gea. It is understood United discussed the possibility of Anders Lindegaard, plus cash going to Feyenoord to help make the deal happen but Vermeer insisted on seeing the deal through.

The 28-year-old was in Van Gaal's original squad for this summer's World Cup - but lost out on the final 23 due to Jasper Cillessen's form.

Vermeer will sign a four-year deal at De Kuip and Ajax have moved quickly to replace Vermeer, snapping up 33-year-old Diederik Boer from FC Zwolle.

Dutch international Vermeer admitted he jumped at the chance to join Feyenoord: 'It was a chance I had to grab with both hands.

‘I’m grateful to Ajax for 14 fantastic years but I had to put myself first. I want to be playing. And I can do that at Feyenoord,' he told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf on Monday.
