Kristin Beck, a transgender former Navy SEAL, is planning a primary challenge to the second-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer.

Beck would be the first transgendered American to serve in Congress, a trailblazer status that will make it practically difficult to attack her in campaign ads. 

But she has already given Hoyer some ammunition that has nothing to do with her sex-reassignment.

'The religion of today’s world is going to destroy the earth,' Beck wrote Feb. 2 on Facebook, in an apparent slap at faiths that judge her situation harshly. 'I really believe this is true.'

Kristin Beck had to wait to dress like a woman and take hormone therapy until her 20 years of US Navy service were over, since transgender Americans are banned from the military

FROM CHRISTOPHER TO KRISTIN: She served as a Navy SEAL through 13 deployments and is now running for Congress in Maryland as a woman

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland is the second highest-ranking Democrat and will face a long-shot challenge in next year's primary election

'I don’t worry about global warming or the politics of China or communism; I worry about religiosity.'

'The two biggest culprits today are the Christians and the Muslims with communism (void of religion, but full of indoctrination and zeal) – taking up a poll [sic] position,' she wrote. 

'The Christians had their Crusades and Inquisitions and their hunting of outcasts and naysayer; which includes people like me throughout time (I will not drink hemlock).'

'Now Islam seems to be following suit,' she claimed, 'and maybe, thanks to modern technology and greater population density could out kill the Christians.' 

The state Board of Elections website shows Beck filed her candidacy paperwork Monday. 

Her campaign website highlights her military service and criticizes the government's handling of the home-loan crisis.

It says Hoyer 'has been too busy helping Wall Street since 2008 to even notice Main Street. 

Hoyer says he'll work to earn his constituents' votes in 2016, but he will face a colorful campaign to send him into retirement.

Beck considered running for a House seat in Florida last year but didn't meet the filing deadline, according to news reports. 

She was a member of both SEAL Team 1 and the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group, a specialized counterterrorism unit referred to by civilians as SEAL Team Six,and 6.

After her military retirement in 2011 she started dressing as a woman and then underwent hormone therapy to transition from male to female.

Hoyer's seat is considered safe in liberal Maryland. He has been a member of Congress since 1981 and supports gay marriage.

'I fought for 20 years for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,' she told CNN; 'I want some happiness'

Some of Beck's former comrades have been accepting of her choice, but not all

One of his daughters is gay and came out as a lesbian just after he announced his position on same-sex unions.

Beck was the subject of a CNN film called 'Lady Valor' and told host Anderson Cooper in September that she wanted to be a SEAL because they were 'the toughest of the tough.'

'I fought for 20 years for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,' she said. 'I want some happiness.'

She was deployed 13 times in all, serving in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. She earned a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and other decorations.

She told Cooper that she had felt like a woman trapped in a man's body since elementary school, but had to keep it a secret in adulthood because transgender men and women are banned from serving in the U.S. military.

In her Facebook essay, Beck complained that she is 'hated by all of the religions with equal zeal.'

'I am living my life as my spirit guides. I prefer two-spirit or twin flame,' she wrote. 'I am not in the wrong body and I have transitioned nothing; I have not changed.'

'My life now, showing two-spirits has put me in direct fire of the prejudice and outright mistreatment toward women, minorities and people who live outside of norms. I see the issues and weep over the subjugation of women and minorities around the world.'

'I lived as a man and now as a woman,' she added; 'I am living a path of two-spirits and the religious zealots say, "This is against god’s plan".' 

'I ask you, "How do you know?" What if my journey while here on earth is to live in both genders? What if this is god’s plan?'
