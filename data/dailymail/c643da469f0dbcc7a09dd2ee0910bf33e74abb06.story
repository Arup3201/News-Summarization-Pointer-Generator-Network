Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has told his players to put their tour tiredness to one side and concentrate on beating Real Madrid in the Michigan Stadium.

Van Gaal repeated his regular complaints about United’s USA tour schedule after training on what is a poor pitch here this evening.

However, with a draw against Real tomorrow guaranteeing United an International Champions Cup Final appearance against Liverpool or Manchester City on in Miami Monday, Van Gaal has stressed that he wants to win.

Confident: Louis van Gaal claims that Manchester United may not need to sign any new players this month

That's how we play! The new boss has been implementing a new style of play with his squad

'Being away longer is a burden for my wife but not for me and the players,' said Van Gaal.

'I’m anxious to win. I always want to win and Man United is a club that always wants to win.

'I can’t say much about the progress of the squad as we have only had training sessions here.

'We have to see that also the players have had a culmination of tiredness of training and travelling and matches.

'I will think about the line up and think about how many players I will change. I will play 50 minutes with the first line up and then change it.

'We don’t talk about the pitches.

'They are used to NFL and that is a throwing game and doesn’t take care of the ground.

'The pitch isn’t good and that’s a pity because we have two fantastic teams who will have to play on a bad pitch.

'The ball wont roll. It’s bumping.'

Van Gaal revealed that defender Chris 
Smalling won’t play against the European champions tomorrow after an 
injury forced him to train alone.

The United boss added, though, that it will take something special to persuade him to turn his back on the 3-5-2 formation he has been working on.

'I can’t see my philosophy working with four defenders,' said Van Gaal.

'It will be five. Maybe there will be a time when I have to play with four. We will see.

'Now all the sessions are arranged for the five defenders system.'

With the start of the Barclays Premier League season only two weeks away, United have only made two signings this summer.

Asked if this was a problem, Van Gaal said: 'I want to give the current players an honest chance. We are winning everything, maybe we don’t need other players.

'Anyway, the transfer window still has a month left.'

United forward Wayne Rooney joined Van Gaal for Friday's press conference at an incredible college stadium that will cater for an enormous 109,000 fans, the biggest crowd United have played in front of for more than 50 years.

'It’s been great,' said Rooney. 'The manager has come in and we are playing a new system and learning that and trying to get better. Over the next few weeks we will get better.

'It’s been tough but the results will come I hope. It would be fantastic to get to the final against a rival but it’s important to beat Real and end the group as leaders.

'There will be 100,000 here and that will be great.

On your marks: Rooney and the rest of the Man United squad were put through their paces on Friday

'It will be amazing, the largest number of fans I have played in front of. It will be a great experience.

'The pitch is soft and the ball doesn’t roll. We have to adapt and try and win.

'I have enjoyed the role I have played in. I am looking forward to playing in a few more games and being successful.'

Rooney revealed that he has been wearing protective strapping on his wrist but added that the problem isn’t serious.
