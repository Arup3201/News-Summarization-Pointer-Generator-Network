A teenage soap star sobbed in the dock today after he was cleared of molesting and raping a fellow stage school pupil.

The 17-year-old bisexual, who cannot be named, was accused of a campaign of abuse against another boy in 2010.

Prosecutors alleged the actor forced the boy into a twisted sex game in the stairwell of a theatre.

He was accused of headbutting the boy and pinning him against a wall before forcing him to perform oral sex while his girlfriend watched to prove he liked men and women sexually.

Cleared: A teenage soap actor was on trial at Blackfriars Crown Court accused of rape and sexual assault but the jury found him not guilty today

But a jury of seven men and five women today cleared the star of rape and three counts of sexual assault dating from between July 2010 and September 2010.

The panel had deliberated for four hours and 45 minutes before reaching its unanimous not guilty verdicts on all counts at Blackfriars Crown Court.

The teenager had wept as the verdicts were returned and was hugged by his sobbing dad as he left the dock.

The teenage actor, who will turn 18 in May, was accused of sending the boy lewd text messages before sexually assaulting him in the darkened stairwell as they prepared for an end-of-year school show.

Prosecutors alleged he then raped the boy the following day, again in the stairwell, to prove he was bisexual to his girlfriend.

- Actor cleared of four sex attacks told the court during his trial

It was said he continued the sexual abuse in September 2010 during the new school term with 'weekly' sex attacks.

But the actor, supported by his family in court every day during the six-day trial, told jurors the sexual contact between the pair was always consensual.

'It was both of us, both consensual, wanting to do things and both enjoying it', he told Blackfriars Crown Court.

'It wasn't a straight man being lured in, it was both of us.'

The teenager said he was 'bi-curious' and approached the boy after hearing rumours he had been with other boys and posted erotic pictures of himself online.

Accused of being a 'bully' who had forced himself on the other boy, the star replied: 'I was willing to experiment with my sexuality and he had apparently done it before with other boys.

'He was another lad who was up for doing things.

'I didn't know any other boys like that, I wanted to try to experiment and he seemed - well, he was up for it.'

The actor told the court he had initially said no sexual contact had taken place at all because he was 'embarrassed' to admit his sexuality in front of teachers and his parents.

He admitted in the witness box breaking down and crying after the boy performed oral sex on him in front of his girlfriend.

'I was very embarrassed, that's my girlfriend there and she is watching a boy suck my penis,' the actor said.

'I was confused and I didn't think it was right.

'I put my head in my hands and started having a cry.'

He denied being attracted to the boy, who he said may have become 'infatuated' with him after they exchanged saucy text messages.

'He was very much the one who took the reins, although I approached him first', he said.

'When I sent pictures of my penis, he sent pictures back.

'He said I had a nice bum, he complemented my bottom and tried to kiss me.

'Whether he said have an infatuation with me, I'm not saying I'm great looking, but whether he had an infatuation I can't answer that.'

The soap star, from Surrey, put his career on hold to fight the legal battle against the sex claims.

He denied rape and three counts of sexual assault.
