Killer: Convicted murderer Askari Abdullah Muhammad is to be executed on Tuesday at Florida State Prison

A man convicted of abducting and killing a Miami couple and later stabbing a prison guard to death is set to be executed after nearly four decades on Florida's death row.

Askari Abdullah Muhammad, previously known as Thomas Knight, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday at Florida State Prison in Starke barring a last-minute, successful appeal.

Governor Rick Scott signed the death warrant after the Florida Supreme Court in December rejected Muhammad's challenge to chemicals used in the state's execution procedure.

The 62-year-old Muhammad was first condemned to die for the 1974 abduction and killings of Sydney and Lillian Gans of Miami.

He was sentenced to die again for killing Correction Officer Richard Burke in 1980 using a sharpened spoon.

Only
 two prisoners have been on Florida’s Death Row longer than Muhammad.

His 
murder of the Ganses, while unfamiliar to newer generations of South 
Floridians, was a major story in July 1974, according to the Miami 
Herald.

Sydney Gans, 64, owned a successful paper bag company and a minor league baseball team, the Miami Beach Flamingos. 

Gans
 also employed parolees looking for a second chance. Muhammad was one of 
them. He had worked for the paper company for 10 days when he kidnapped 
Sydney Gans at rifle point.

Caught: Muhammad's mughsot the day he was arrested for the murder of Sydney and Lillian Gans, which was a major story in Florida in July 1974

Murdered: In October 1980, Muhammad thrust a sharpened spoon into the chest of corrections officer Richard Burke, 48, because the prison would not let him see his mother

Muhammad forced him to drive to the Gans’ home, where he kidnapped Lillian Gans.

The three drove to downtown Miami, where he forced Sydney Gans to 
enter a bank and withdraw $50,000.

Muhammad - armed with a semi-automatic .30-caliber carbine - held Lillian Gans in the back of the businessman’s car.

Inside, Gans alerted the bank manager, who called authorities, according to the Herald.

Gans, fearing for his wife’s safety, returned to the car.

A slew of agents and cops covertly tailed the car as Muhammad ordered Gans to drive to West Miami-Dade.

In a blunder that still riles the Gans relatives today, agents lost track of the car.

In a secluded wooded area at Southwest 132nd Street and 117th Avenue, Muhammad shot each of the Gans with a bullet to the neck.

He disappeared as heavily armed officers swarmed the woods, according to the Herald.

For hours, authorities scoured the woods. Teargas was deployed. A deputy found Muhammad buried in the mud, the money and the rifle underneath his body.

In October 1980, Muhammad thrust a sharpened spoon into the chest of corrections officer Burke, 48, because the prison would not let Knight see his mother, who was making her first visit.
