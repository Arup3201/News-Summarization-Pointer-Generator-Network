A 72-year-old man who inherited the fortune of a partner 22 years his senior is set to lose their home and much of her cash  – because they were not married.

Wheelchair-bound Leonard Taylor shared Doris Luker’s home for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died.

But a court heard the ‘toy boy’, who is now seeing a 30-year-old woman, faces having to sell the semi-detached property to pay a £100,000 legal bill after losing a court battle over a £61,000 cheque Mrs Luker paid him a week before her death.

'Toy boy': Leonard Taylor shared Doris Luker's home for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died. He is set to lose the home and money he inherited because they were not married

New partner: 72-year-old Mr Taylor is now in a relationship with 30-year-old Alberta

In a case which sounds a warning to 
unmarried couples, the Appeal Court was told yesterday that when Mrs 
Luker died in October 2003, she left Mr Taylor her home in Birmingham, then worth £150,000, 
its contents, her car and £28,000 in cash.

The remainder of her estate was to be split between the British Heart Foundation and the Cancer Research Campaign.

But after Mr Taylor, a retired architect who is now seeing a 30-year-old known as Alberta, had taken his portion, it emerged there was nothing left for the charities.

The executor of Mrs Luker’s estate queried the cheque payment and, with the charities’ backing, launched a High Court fight to get the cash sum repaid.

In
March, Judge David Cooke accepted that Mr Taylor had treated the 
‘intelligent and financially aware’ former company secretary ‘in every 
way as a gentleman’, but ruled in the executor’s favour and ordered the 
repayment of the cash.

The
judge said Mr Taylor had a forceful personality and added that, even if
the money had been a gift, it was invalidated by ‘undue influence’.

Yesterday
the pensioner - who needs a wheelchair after suffering two strokes 
following his partner’s death - failed in a bid to overturn the ruling 
at the Appeal Court.  

Charity battle: Mr Taylor shared Doris Luker's home in Birmingham for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died. He may now have to sell the property to cover the charities legal bills - estimated at £100,000

Now, as well paying back the £61,000, Mr Taylor may lose his home to cover the 
charities’ legal bills - estimated at £100,000 - although enforcement of
the order could be delayed until after his death. 

His barrister James Quirke told the London court that, had the couple been
man and wife, the venerable legal ‘presumption of advancement’ - which 
assumes that cash and property transfers between close family members 
are outright gifts - would have applied.

But, because Mr Taylor was not 
formally married to his benefactor, the opposite presumption - that the 
£61,000 was a repayable loan - held sway with Judge Cooke.

Mr
Quirke argued that the ‘presumption that the money was a loan applied 
to strangers’ and was of ‘no application in a domestic context’.

He added: ‘The judge has put the cart before the horse. No part of this presumption has any place in a domestic transaction.

‘The
payment of a cheque from one long-term co-habitee to another should not
be subject to the same assumptions as a commercial transaction.

‘He
did all, or almost all, the work in their common household and looked 
after her in her illness. She made all, or almost all, the payments in 
the household including substantial payments to him from time to time.’

The court heard the couple got together in 1985 when Mr Taylor was 46 and Mrs Luker was 68.

He moved into her home in Hall Green, Birmingham, three years later.

Ruling against Mr Taylor, Lord Justice Etherton said: ‘The law presumes, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the payment of money implies an obligation to repay it.

‘The long term, loving, supporting, relationship - which Judge Cooke was perfectly willing to accept - was not sufficient in his view to explain the transaction as a gift.’

He said the High Court judge had ‘assessed the credibility of the witnesses and found on the balance of probabilities that Mrs Luker didn't intend it as an outright gift.’ 

Cancer Research UK legacy administration manager Sianne Kerrane said: 'We welcome the High Court’s decision to fulfil the charitable wishes of the late Doris Luker.

'Over a third of Cancer Research UK’s lifesaving work into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer is funded through gifts in Wills.

'In only a small number of cases are there any disputes and, for the most part, the family and loved ones of the deceased are happy for the contents of the will to be carried out.

'We are very grateful to Mrs Luker for choosing to remember us in her will.'

Stephen Morgan, Head of Legacies Management, British Heart Foundation said: 'We are pleased the High Court had ruled in our favour and has chosen to respect the wishes of the late Doris Luker.

'We are always grateful to everyone who chooses to remember us in their will and support our work in the fight against heart disease.'
