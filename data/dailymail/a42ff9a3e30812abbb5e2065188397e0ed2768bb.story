An American PhD student has relived the terrifying moment he was caught up in gunfire between the Taliban and Nato-assisted forces  - prompting him to write his own will.

Saiz Ahmed had just eaten dinner and returned to his fourth-floor room at the InterContinental Hotel in Kabul when he heard loud noises and - thinking he was about to die - he cowered on the flood an penned his will.

The Afghan legal history student survived the attack, performed by the Taliban, according to reports - but 18 others did not.

Mr Ahmed thought that there might have been a power cut when the lights went out but moments later realised it was gunfire.

He stayed put inside the hotel and grabbed a piece of paper to 
hastily scribble down his will in case he was killed in the explosions.

'It
was clear that people were shooting from inside the building - a number
of people I didn't know where - and from outside,' he told CNN.

'I didn't know who was who. They might have been people blowing themselves up.'

Mr Ahmed said that over the next few hours he endured the sound of constant gunfire and explosions roughly every 45 minutes.

The building rocked with the force of the blasts but he remained inside after speaking by phone with relatives in Kabul.

He
said that he was sure that nobody would get out alive and he scrawled 
the names of a handful of charities on a piece of paper in case he was 
killed.

He continued: 'I've never experienced explosions that near. I felt the ground move up.

'I was just praying that the next one wouldn't be right under me or above me or anywhere else where there were people.'

Meanwhile these images show how a helicopter hovers over the hotel - the next moment a trace of fire is seen hitting the roof and killing Taliban troops who were trying to siege the Western-style hotel.

The siege, however, was still not over. Some hours later the last insurgent blew himself up in a hotel room.

Officials said today that eleven civilians were killed in the assault that has sent shock waves through the Afghan capital.

The attack on the five-storey hotel in the capital raised doubt about the ability of Afghan security forces to take charge of securing the nation from foreign combat forces.

The assault began at around 10pm last night and eight suicide attackers killed the guards and entered the building.

During the next four hours, a number of workers were killed as the men stormed through the hotel, which sits on a hill overlooking the city.

The 11 civilians killed included a judge from an unnamed province, five hotel workers and three Afghan policemen, Latifullah Mashal, the spokesman of the Afghan National Directorate for Security. said.

The InterContinental - known widely as 
the 'Inter-Con' opened in the late 1960s - was the nation's first 
international luxury hotel.

It
has at least 200 rooms and was once part of an international chain. But
when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the hotel was left to 
fend for itself.

It was used by Western journalists during the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.

On November 23 2003, a rocket exploded nearby, shattering windows but causing no casualties.

Twenty-two
rockets hit the Inter-Con between 1992 and 1996, when factional 
fighting convulsed Kabul under the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani.

All the windows were broken, water mains were damaged and the outside structure pockmarked.

Some, but not all, of the damage was repaired during Taliban rule.

Attacks
in the Afghan capital have been relatively rare, although violence has 
increased since the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden in a U.S. raid in 
Pakistan and the start of the Taliban's annual spring offensive.

He said no foreigners were killed, but two were among 14 people wounded in the attack. He did not disclose their nationalities.

One guest, named as Jawid, said he jumped out a one-story window to flee the shooting.

'I was running with my family,' he said. 'There was shooting. The restaurant was full with guests.'

A police source said a wedding party was underway when the attack happened and that the death toll could have been much higher.

The attackers were heavily armed with machine guns, anti-aircraft weapons, rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and grenade launchers, the Afghan officials said. Afghan police rushed to the scene and firefights broke out.

‘We were locked in a room. Everybody was shooting and firing,’ said Abdul Zahir Faizada, head of the local council in Herat province in western Afghanistan. I heard a lot of shooting.’

The attack occurred the day before a conference was scheduled in Kabul to discuss plans for Afghan security forces to take the lead for securing an increasing number of areas of the country between now and 2014 when international forces are expected to move out of combat roles.

Afghans across the country were in the city to attend, although it's not known who was staying at the Inter-Continental.

Nazar Ali Wahedi, chief of intelligence for Helmand province in the south who was attending the conference, called the assailants ‘the enemy of stability and peace’ in Afghanistan.

‘Our room was hit by several bullets,’ said Wahedi. ‘We spent the whole night in our room.’

U.S. Army Maj. Jason Waggoner, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Afghanistan, said the helicopters killed three gunmen and Afghan security forces clearing the hotel worked their way up to the roof and engaged the remaining insurgents.

As the helicopters attacked and Afghan security forces moved in, there were four massive explosions.

Officials at the scene said the blasts occurred when security forces either fired on suicide bombers or they blew themselves up.

After the gunmen were killed, the hotel lights that had been blacked out during the attack came back on.

Afghan security vehicles and ambulances were removing the dead and wounded from the area.

Hours later, however, the last of the suicide bombers, who had been holed up in a room, blew himself up, the final act of violence of the night.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the rare night-time attack in the capital - an apparent attempt to show that they remain potent despite heavy pressure from coalition and Afghan security forces.

It came less than a week after President Barack Obama announced he was withdrawing 33,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan and would end the American combat role by the end of 2014.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid later issued a statement claiming that Taliban attackers killed guards at a gate and entered the hotel.

‘One of our fighters called on a mobile phone and said: “We have gotten onto all the hotel floors and the attack is going according to the plan. We have killed and wounded 50 foreign and local enemies.

We are in the corridors of the hotel now taking guests out of their rooms - mostly foreigners. We broke down the doors and took them out one by one”.’

But Kabul Police Chief Gen. Mohammad Ayub Salangi said the death toll was only ten, who were all employed at the hotel. He provided no further details, but said none of the conference attendees staying at the hotel were harmed.

‘There were no casualties among the guests - either foreign or Afghan,’ he said. ‘No high-ranking government officials were killed.’

Earlier on Tuesday, officials from the U.S., Pakistan and Afghanistan met in the capital to discuss prospects for making peace with Taliban insurgents to end the nearly decade-long war.

'The fact that we are discussing reconciliation in great detail is success and progress, but challenges remain and we are reminded of that on an almost daily basis by violence,' Jawed Ludin, Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister, said at a news conference.

'The important thing is that we act and that we act urgently and try to do what we can to put an end to violence.'

Target: The Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul is popular with foreigners and Afghan officials

On June 18, insurgents wearing Afghan
army uniforms stormed a police station near the presidential palace and
opened fire on officers, killing nine.

Late
last month, a suicide bomber wearing an Afghan police uniform 
infiltrated the main Afghan military hospital, killing six medical 
students. A month before that, a suicide attacker in an army uniform 
sneaked past security at the Afghan Defense Ministry, killing three 
people.

Other hotels in the capital have also been targeted.

In January 2008, militants stormed Kabul's most popular luxury hotel, the Serena, hunting down Westerners who cowered in a gym during a coordinated assault that killed eight people. An American, a Norwegian journalist and a Philippine woman were among the dead.

A suicide car bomber in December 2009, struck near the home of a former Afghan vice president and a hotel frequented by Westerners, killing eight people and wounding nearly 40 in a neighborhood considered one of Kabul's safest.

And in February 2010, insurgents struck two residential hotels in the heart of Kabul, killing 20 people including seven Indians, a French filmmaker and an Italian diplomat.
