For one obese woman, trying to shed the pounds came with one major hurdle - she hated fruit and vegetables so much she hadn't touched a piece of green veg since she was four and not a morsel of fruit had passed her lips since the age of 10.

But at 21st 2lb 38-year-old Wendy from Manchester, was so scared her weight was going to kill her she decided to bite the broccoli and face her fruit and vegetable phobia.

After seven weeks of a calorie controlled diet, the mother-of-three, who appeared on Channel 4's weight loss documentary, Weighing Up The Enemy, last night managed to drop 11lb, 7.2 per cent of her body fat.

At  21st 2lb, Wendy, 38, from Manchester, was so scared her weight was going to kill her she decided to break the habit of a lifetime and try fruit and veg

Wendy's family motivated her: 'I thought I was going to die - that my children wouldn’t get to see me'

The former nursery manager, was made redundant seven years ago and lives off council benefits.

'We currently receive housing benefit, council tax benefit and my husband receives a disability living allowance. It’s not an option for us to me back to work. We would be worse off than we are now,' she said. 

It was after losing her job that Wendy piled on the pounds, putting on 6st in as many years. 

'I ate loads out of boredom more than anything. If I was feeling a bit low  I just wanted my food,' she admitted on the Channel 4 programme presented by Dr Christian Jessen.

She also admitted that there one friend who was always there for her - KFC.

‘Fried chicken was my favourite. It's  like a thousand little kisses.

'As you put them into your mouth it’s like they’re kissing you and your tongue’s saying thank you.' 

'I ate loads out of boredom more than anything,' said Wendy. 'If I was feeling a bit low I just wanted my food'

Despite romanticising about her favourite junk food, Wendy realised that her penchant for fried, unhealthy meals was leading her down a dangerous path.

‘I knew if I didn’t change my lifestyle I was going to be dead soon – my body was going to give up.

'I thought I was going to die - that my children wouldn’t get to see me. 

'I'd done the Atkins Diet, Slimming World, Weight Watchers and I'd even tried a Chinese tea diet,' she says, but none of them had worked.

At 21st 2lb Wendy was carrying an extra 11st and at 52 per cent, her body fat was double what it should have been.

In order to shift the pounds welfare reliant Wendy took on the challenge to stick to a calorie controlled diet, consuming a maximum of 1,200 calories a day.

But without fruit and vegetables to eat, keeping down the calories was no simple feat.

'I didn’t eat fruit and I didn’t eat vegetables. Perhaps if I did, I wouldn’t have been that size,' she said.

'Last time I'd had an apple I must have been about ten or 12. I didn’t have anything that was remotely healthy to be fair.

'Green was poison!'

After seven weeks Wendy lost 11lb, 7.2 per cent of her body fat and is continuing on her diet

But spurred on by her husband Ian, Wendy decided to give the green stuff a go.  

Apart from the lack of healthy foods, she also had trouble cutting out the takeaway and snacks.

'I tried not to cut everything out I enjoyed eating so that when I had a craving I could go upstairs into my drawer, which has given me loads of pleasure in the past, and have something I enjoyed eating as a treat. 

Exercise also proved a challenge - even a short walk around the block was a huge challenge.

'I have tried it in the past and it’s been too painful to get round the whole thing.

On her first attempt, Wendy hoped to burn  500 calories, the equivalent of two Mars Bars, but was disappointed to learn she had only worked off 95 calories.

But spurred on by the idea that she may not see her children grow up, Wendy stuck to a calorie controlled diet and upped her exercise - hitting the gym three times a week.

'Before all of this my confidence was at rock bottom,' she says.

After seven weeks Wendy lost 11lb, 7.2 per cent of her body fat.

‘The weight loss has been great for me. It's such a massive goal I’ve wanted to start for such a long time,' she says.

'This is the diet I’ve taken most seriously and will continue until I’m at an ideal weight.'
