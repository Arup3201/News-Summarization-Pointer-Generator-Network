Putting your thumb up  is a recognised hand signal the world over, and the ultimate sign of approval.

So it was a good choice of gesture for Elle-Rose Williams, 25, and her fiancé Paddy Moogan, 30, to pick as their go-to pose while on an around-the-world trip.

The couple  documented their mammoth journey, spanning months and continents, by capturing photographs of their thumbs in front of landmarks, skyscrapers, beautiful scenery and historical monuments.

Elle, a social media manager and travel blogger from London told MailOnline: 'It started as just a fun way to record where we'd been, whenever we saw something gorgeous or memorable we'd take a photo of a thumbs up in front of it.

'As we travelled more it became a running joke, and we'd make sure we did it everywhere we visited.' 

The duo's  adventure kicked off in New Zealand two years ago. After living in Queenstown for six months they visited Australia before passing through Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and the USA, thumbs at the ready.

Commenting on the aesthetics of the thumb photos Ellie, who writes the blog The World and Then Some says: 'They aren’t great photos. They’re not artistic. They’re not even lit properly in most cases. But they tell our story. They show where we’ve been and how far we’ve come.'

With so much time in front of the camera, the couple's thumbs have won  attention online. 

Elle describes the The Grand Palace in Bangkok as 'one of the most beautiful places I've ever been'

To date, they've been photographed front of the The Louvre in Paris, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, The Grand Palace in Bangkok, Central Park in New York, the Harbour Bridge in Sydney, The Grand Canyon and Notre Dame, also in Paris. 

Elle says, 'My favourite photo is the one we took in NYC at Christmas time (its the darkly lit one, with a Christmas tree in the background).

'It was taken moments after Pad proposed to me, in the exact spot it happened. Which might be the most 'thumbs up' moment of my life so far.'

'We get married next year - so of course I'm hoping to get a photo of us after saying 'I do' with the wedding rings included!' 

'I think the photos sum us up as a couple, we're very laid back, happy and just take things as they come.'
