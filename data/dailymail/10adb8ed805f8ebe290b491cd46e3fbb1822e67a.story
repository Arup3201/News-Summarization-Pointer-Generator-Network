The worst job in America is that of a lumberjack, according to a new ranking of the American job market.

And the best is a mathematician, with an average salary of over $100,000, says CareerCast, which takes into account a combination of factors including income, environment, growth opportunity and stress.

Following close behind lumberjacks, who earn a pitiful $24,000 a year, the most 
awful occupation of 2014 is that of a newspaper reporter, and then an
 active military personnel, while being a university professor and then a
 statistician were found to be the next best jobs.

In contrast, being a university professor or a statistician were found to be among the best jobs.

Being a whiz with numbers in today's job market provides a wide range of well-paid opportunities, according to mathematician Jessika Sobanski.

'Whether itâ€™s new product sales, a start-up business model or an established TV station, for example, everything is based on numbers,' she says to CareerCast.

Tenured university professors, though a 
difficult role to score, enjoy highly rewarding careers, while software 
engineers and computer systems analysts thrive in an ever-expanding 
market where they are in high demand.

Woeful job: Just behind lumberjacks, newspaper reporters and broadcasters were ranked as having some of the worst jobs in 2014, thanks mainly to the changing face of the media

Somewhat interestingly, dental hygienists come in at number six on the best jobs list, gifted with competitive salaries averaging $70,210 and flexible working hours, despite dentists historically having the second highest (after doctors) suicide rate of any profession in the U.S.

Other healthcare roles in the top ten best jobs list include ear doctors, occupational therapists and speech pathologists.

As for the 
worst jobs in the U.S., a number of unsurprising roles cropped up, 
including taxi drivers at number four, garbage collectors at number 
eight and prison guards at number ten.

Newspaper 
reporters took the second spot, followed by broadcasters at number five;
 high-stress, low-paid positions which are fast disappearing as print 
publications fall into a black hole.

Open wide: Dental hygienists were ranked as having the sixth best job this year in terms of wages and flexible hours, despite dentists actually having the second highest suicide rate of any profession in the U.S.

New to the 
list this year as the sixth worst job title was 'head cook' - not to 
be confused with the esteemed role of a chef (celebrity or otherwise) - but
 more hourly workers in chains or high school cafeterias.

And
 noble firefighters came in at number nine, for the high danger they 
find themselves in every day, in return for relatively meager wages.

Considering
 we spend most of our waking lives at work, it's either an affirming or 
somewhat depressing set of findings, depending of course, on where we happen to 
show up to the office every day.
