An $100m NFL star suing his ex-fiancee to get back a $785,000 10-carat diamond engagement ring actually sent her texts saying she could keep it, according to her lawyer.

Mario Williams, defensive end for the Buffalo Bills worth over $30m with a $100m contract, is suing his ex-fiancee Erin Marzouki for the return of the ring after their relationship turned sour.

Marzouki, who is counter suing to keep the ring levied accusations through her lawyer that Williams lied in his lawsuit and repeatedly told her to keep the gift.

Her attorney, high profile Texas lawyer Anthony Buzbee, released a series of text messages this week that make it seem as if Williams has in fact urged Marzouki to keep the ring, contrary the allegations filed in his lawsuit, according a report from Ultimate Texans.

In the messages Williams writes, 'Keep those material things. It means nothing to me anymore,' later adding 'KEEP IT! Remember me by it.'

Buzbee described Williams actions as emotionally unstable and said the football player is confused as to whether he wants to be married or single.

Buzbee also introduced into evidence an email written by Williams earlier this year that asks Marzouki to reconcile.

'I just want to verbally discuss and answer things 
knowing you have closed the door,' Williams wrote, 'I still can’t say one thing bad about 
you that sticks.'

Despite the new evidence coming to light Williams vehemently denies the allegations, saying that the messages were taken out of context.

'Obviously it’s just a tactic to cover up the point of the whole 
thing,' Williams told the website.

'It is what it is. I could really care less. All 
it is (is) allegations and text messages and what not, whatever 
information blown out of proportion. I mean, it’s completely out of 
context.'

Yet in another message released by Buzbee, Williams was allegedly more explicit in his desire to give Marzouki the ring.

'She said she was going to 
keep the ring n told her fine. I put down using material things as 
leverage long ago. She is free to be n do as she wants,' Williams wrote.

In his lawsuit Williams claims that Marzouki ended the couple's engagement after a year because she 'never intended to marry and used the relationship as a means 
to get money and acquire gifts,' according to the court documents.

In response to the charges Marzouki 
has filed a counter suit to what she calls her ex-fiance Mario Williams'
'silly' accusations and doesn't intend to give back the ring because it
was given to her as an unconditional gift.

She
says Williams was the one who broke off the engagement because part of 
him 'wanted to be married and start a family, while another part wanted 
to continue to live the life of a wealthy bachelor who could do whatever
he wanted, with whomever he wanted, whenever he wanted.'

Williams' lawyers have asked the court to obtain the ring from Ms. Marzouki until the legal action is resolved.

Counter punch: Marzouki maintains Williams broke up with her repeatedly. Williams' suit claims Marzouki was only seeking his money.

Williams was the first selection in the 2006 NFL draft by the Texans and played in Houston through the 2011 season.

Although by regular standards the ring is a fortune, it is pocket change to Williams who last year signed one of the most lucrative contracts for a defensive player in NFL history: a six-year, $100 million with the Buffalo Bills with $50 million in cash guaranteed.
