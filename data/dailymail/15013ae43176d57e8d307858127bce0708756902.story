A group of fifth grade boys pretended to be a team of synchronized swimmers for their school's talent competition and not only stole the show but gained worldwide recognition.

The eight-boy three-minute routine went viral after being posted on Youtube and has over 10,000 views.

The video clip shows the fifth grade students at W.A. Porter Elementary School in Hurst, Texas comically dressed in swimming caps, goggles, and swim trunks doing their best impression of a synchronized swim team.

The fifth grade talent show performers began their skit by lining up on stage in goggles and swim caps like a group of synchronized swimmers

The boys then lined up behind a 'water wall' draped with blue tarp to make it seem as though they were in a swimming pool

The comical fifth graders raised their hands in the air as they mimicked the dance routine of synchronized swimmers

The boys begin the skit by making their way behind a wall draped with a blue tarp meant to represent water.

The young performers choreographed a dance in which they pretend to swim, line-up in the water, and even dive across the 'pool' all while maintaining the poise of a synchronized swimmer.

One of the boys mom's saw a similar video on Youtube which gave her the idea for the skit which went swimmingly in the end despite some obstacles during the rehearsal period.

'There were a few practices I was ready to throw in the towel, but we persevered,' mom Nathalie Hembree, who choreographed the skit, told KDFW.

'One of the moms posted it on Facebook and another on YouTube and it’s taken off,' said the school’s principal, Greg Bicknell to ABC News.

The most surprising thing to the boys in the skit was not that they had a good performance but that they became over night internet celebrities.

'I think they were a little surprised by the reaction at the talent show but even more so afterwards,' Bicknell said.

'I think they’ve been really surprised by all the attention this has gathered.'

The boys pretended to do swirls in the pool as they elegantly outstretched their arms

The children continued to dance in perfect unison as they neared the end of their adorable routine

As the boys neared their grand finale, they kicked their legs up in the air for one last hurrah

The boys made a final swimmer's pose as the talent show audience erupts in applause
