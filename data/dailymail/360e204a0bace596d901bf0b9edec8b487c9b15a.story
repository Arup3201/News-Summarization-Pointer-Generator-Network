British adults are turning their backs on children and young people and see them as violent animals who are beyond help, according to children's charity Barnardos.

A recent survey of more than 2,000 people found almost half believe British youngsters are becoming 'feral' and 'behaving like animals' while a worrying ten per cent believe that badly behaved children over the age of 10 are 'beyond help'.

The charity has drawn comparisons between Britain and continental Europe where people are said to be far more supportive of youngsters and parents more willing to help each other out within their communities.

Grim outlook: A survey by children's charity Barnardo's has revealed a 
depressing state-of-affairs where huge numbers of British adults see 
youngsters as 'animals', 'feral' and 'beyond help'

In countries such as Spain, children are seen as everyone's responsibility while in Britain adults have become judgemental and less ready to step in if they notice a mother struggling to cope, they claim.

The charity points to figures which show that in continental Europe there are fewer child deaths and fewer numbers of children taken into child protection.

Barnardo’s chief executive Anne Marie Carrie said: 'It is depressing that so many people are ready to give up on children, writing them off as ‘animals’ and ‘feral’. 

'What hope is there for childhood in the UK today if this is how adults think?'

Tarred with the same brush: While only a tiny proportion of children took part in the recent riots across London and other urban areas, Anne Marie Carrie, the head of Barnardo's, believes all children are at risk of being stigmatised

Ms Carrie believes that children who behave well, working hard at school, volunteering for charity or joining groups like the Brownies or the Cubs are being stigmatised by a small minority who behave badly.

She points to the recent riots in London and other urban areas, where only a tiny proportion of children took part, as an example of how people's views can be distorted.

She added: 'We seem to have forgotten the fact that most children are well behaved and instead we are unquestionably accepting a stereotype of young people as criminal and revolting.

'We aren’t asking people to put up with yobbish behaviour, but we do need to change our attitudes towards troubled children.

The small minority of children who come across as angry and abusive have sadly often been scarred by their upbringing.

'But it’s never too late to believe in children and change their life story – it doesn’t have to end how it began.'

ICM Research reveals that the public holds a negative view of all children, despite the majority being well behaved, attending school, taking part in activities and a significant number contributing to their communities and volunteering.

Barnardos argues that the difficult behaviour of youngsters in contact with the youth justice system needs to be tackled more effectively pointing to the numbers who have experienced troubled upbringings or who have speech or language difficulties.

Evidence shows that the sort of whole family approaches Barnardo’s runs which challenge and support parents and their children to face up to their behaviour and accept responsibility for their actions have a major impact.

Life Story will premiere across the Channel 4 network, after 8.20pm, on Thursday, November 3 and will run until Friday, November 18.
