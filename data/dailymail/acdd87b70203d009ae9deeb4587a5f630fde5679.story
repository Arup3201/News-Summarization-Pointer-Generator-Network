A desperate search is underway after a four-day-old baby went missing in the early hours today from the room where his mother and father were sleeping.

The newborn's mother 
called 911 after waking at 4.30am on Thursday to find her son Kayden 
Powell missing from his bassinet in a room where she was sleeping at a
 home in the Town of Beloit, Wisconsin. 

The 18-year-old mother, Brianna 
Marshall, and the infant's 23-year-old father, Bruce Powell, were 
staying at the house, said town police chief Steven Kopp.

Missing: Kayden Powell, now five-days-old, disappeared from his bassinet in the early hours of yesterday

Reunited: Brianna Marshall and Bruce Powell, pictured shortly after Kayden's birth, are back with their son

Police reported on Thursday afternoon that a person of interest had been arrested in Iowa. That person is believed to be a relative, according to wqow.

Kristin Smith was arrested in West Branch on fraud charges after a warrant was put out for her arrest in Texas. She has not been charged in the baby's disappearance but is due to be questioned by the FBI.

Baby Kayden has still not been found but Smith was carrying baby clothing. She claims not to know what happened to the child.

Smith claims to be Brianna Marshall's half-sister, with the women sharing the same father. The women had reportedly discussed moving to Colorado, along with Bruce Powell, after the baby was born.

Chief Kopp confirmed that Smith left the home in the early hours of Thursday - before the mother reported the child missing.

West Branch, Iowa is 170miles from Beloit - roughly a two and a half hour drive away.

Fears: Brianna and Bruce had feared for their son's safety after waking to find he was missing

There were no signs of a break-in at the home and police said it was being processed as a crime scene.

No one in or around the home reported anything suspicious, according to police reports.

The
 mother, who just turned 18, and father were at the police station 
cooperating with police along with the mother's brother and a friend. 
They were all at the house on Wednesday night.

The
 homeowner of the property where the family were staying is listed as 
46-year-old Mark Bennett who has a history of arrests for battery and 
criminal misdemeanors.

The FBI and Wisconsin Department of Justice are helping local authorities in the search in Rock County.

Search: Forty officers from law enforcement agencies have now joined in the search for missing Kayden

The Rock County Sheriff's Office had 
provided 16 staff at the scene, including all members of its detective 
bureau and its special investigations unit.

Kopp says the incident is not 
believed to be a custody dispute. The chief says an Amber Alert was not 
issued because the disappearance doesn't meet the criteria.

An Amber Alert is only issued if the child is at risk of serious injury
 or death and there is sufficient descriptive information of child, 
captor or captor's vehicle.

The
 baby was born at Beloit Memorial Hospital. He is African-American, 20 
inches long, 6 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes, according to 
police.

Brianna Marshall, 18, called police after awaking around 4.30am and finding her newborn son missing from his bassinet

Scene: Baby Kayden was snatched from his crib at this Wisconsin home yesterday morning. Police say there were no signs of forced entry at the house, which is currently being processed as a crime scene
