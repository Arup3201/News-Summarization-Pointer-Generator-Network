A Georgia mother says it was a pair of 9 and 10-year-old neighborhood boys who ran to her rescue and instructed her how to perform CPR on her two-month-old son after hearing her desperate cries for help.

When Susanna Rohm’s son Isaiah abruptly stopped breathing on Monday afternoon she was sitting home alone and in her panic lost her cell phone, and as she immediately felt, any chance of calling 911.

'I was sitting in the living room with the baby and I noticed that he was off that day. He seemed kind of non-responsive to my smile. Something didn't feel right. At that point I put my finger under his nose and realized he was not breathing,' she told 11alive.

Heroes: Rocky Hurt, 9, and Ethan Wilson, 10, were playing football outside their Georgia home on Monday when they heard Susanna Rohm's desperate cries for help

Panic: Mrs Rohm, seen holding her two-month-old son, realized her baby had stopped breathing and in her panic lost her cell phone to call 911 herself

Not having a land line she carried her baby outside while screaming for anyone to call 911.

Across the street in Marietta was 9-year-old Rocky Hurt and 10-year-old Ethan Wilson tossing a football.

Though the woman’s cry initially scared the boys, they obeyed before going one more step further.

'I said even if it's a burglar we still need to help because it's the right thing to do,' recalled Rocky.

As Ethan called police and waited on the ambulance outside, Mrs Rohm said Rocky raced inside to her, a boy she had never met before, and realizing what was wrong directed her on what to do.

Instructors: The two boys say they not only called 911 for the woman but rushed over to instruct her on how to deliver CPR to the infant after seeing a how-to poster at school

'I told her to push on the baby's chest five to 10 times with only two fingers, tilt back the baby's head, plug the baby's nose and breathe into the baby's mouth,' said Rocky.

'He said it so confidently that I just listened to him right away,' the mother said.

Seconds later, the baby started streaming.

'He screamed but I told her that that's a good sign because the baby's breathing,' Rocky said.

An ambulance arrived moments later with Ethan guiding them in.

Recognition: After a few seconds the baby began breathing again, saving its life according to the mother but deserving no more than a thanks according to the boys

'If the little boy hadn't shown me how to do the compressions right here ... my baby would not be alive right now,' she told Fox News Atlanta. 'And I am incredibly grateful.'

The boys say they learned CPR after memorizing the steps seen on a poster hung in their elementary school's cafeteria.

'We just wanted to know if case it happened, but we never knew we'd have to do that,' said Ethan.

'We didn't care if we were on the news,' said Rocky. 'We just cared about saving the baby.'

Mrs Rohm says Isaiah later spent two nights in a hospital while diagnosed with sleep apnea.
