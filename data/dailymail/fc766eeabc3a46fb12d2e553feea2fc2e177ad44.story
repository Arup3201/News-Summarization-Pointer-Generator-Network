A powerful police chiefs’ ‘jobs for the boys’ empire is to be broken up following a damning report by ex-Army chief General Sir Nick Parker.

The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and its spin-off businesses run by serving and retired officers make millions of pounds a year from taxpayers and businesses.

Two ‘non-profit’ firms set up by ACPO to administer the National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme and run by former police officers built up a surplus of £1.9 million from 2008 and 2012.

Now four years after ACPO’s activities were exposed by The Mail on Sunday it has been told to sever links with commercial enterprises in General Parker’s report.

ACPO Vice President Chief Constable Sara Thornton said last night: ‘All chief officers will want to consider General Sir Nick Parker’s report carefully and we will work with Police and Crime Commissioners to take forward the recommendations.’
