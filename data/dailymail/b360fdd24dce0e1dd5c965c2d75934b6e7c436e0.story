Barack Obama's step-grandmother led celebrations in his ancestral Kenyan homeland today as he rolled to re-election and a second term in the White House.

Meanwhile children at his old school in Jakarta celebrated in their classrooms as the results were announced.

Sarah Onyango Obama was seen singing and dancing in Nyang'oma Kogelo village where she lives in western Kenya, some 400km north of the capital Nairobi - is also the place where the president's late father Barack Obama was raised.

Hundreds gathered clapping and cheering in front of a screen to find out the results of  east Africa's favourite adopted son.

Well-wishers, family members and armies of local and foreign journalists have descended on Kogelo, the tiny village in western Kenya where Obama's 91-year-old step-grandmother lives.

Obama is the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya and has five Kenyan half-brothers and a half-sister.

Since 2004, when Obama was running 
for the Senate in Illinois, the Harvard-trained lawyer and civil rights 
activist has enjoyed rock star status in Kenya.

points to a white shell and declared: 'Obama is very far ahead and is 
definitely going to win.'
