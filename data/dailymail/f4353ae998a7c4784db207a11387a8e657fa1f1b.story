An Ohio mother-of-two is suing an abortion clinic after it failed to terminate her pregnancy.

Ariel Knights, 22, and her fiance adore their 'miracle baby' daughter who was born in September. But doctors had originally warned the couple that a medical condition Knights suffers meant her life was at serious risk if they went ahead with the pregnancy.

She agonized over the decision, but, with a preschool-aged son and a fiance to think of, she called Akron Women's Medical Group and booked in the March 2012 abortion.

'It was a decision I made because my life was in danger,' she said. 'I was put in jeopardy.'

On the morning of her appointment, in March 2012, Knights said women were being herded into the clinic's waiting room like cattle.

'Every seat was full. People were standing,' Knights told the Beacon Journal. 'It was pretty much like a slaughterhouse; it was like OK, next, next.'

She described how, when her name was called, she walked into a cramped room, hopped onto a table and, as instructed, positioned her lower body over a trash bag. When the doctor was finished, and she was still woozy from the sedation, Knights was handed her belongings and shown the door.

'(The doctor) said, "All right, everything's good and clear, everything went well,"' she recalled, thinking that was it.

But days later, she said she became 
severely ill and in pain. She visited her family doctor then she went to
 ER where an obstetrician gave her an internal ultrasound.

'The
 look on (the doctor's) face when he found out, he was like, "Oh my 
goodness, honey, you're still pregnant,"' she told the Journal. 'My 
fiance and I, we both were kind of in shock.'

She called the Akron abortion clinic, who are denying the allegations against them, and she said she was told she could visit their Cleveland-area office but declined. Knights then contacted another clinic, which, according to the lawsuit, told her it would not treat her for 'somebody else's mistake.'

At that point, Knights and her fiance decided to go ahead with the pregnancy.

But because she suffered uterine didelphys, which results in a double uterus with individual cervices, it was dangerous and extremely stressful, she said.

She first learned she had the genetic condition while carrying her son. He, however, was carried in the left uterus which was healthy enough to hold a baby to near full-term but doctors said in a February 2012 exam that this fetus was located in the weaker right uterus.

The fear that the weakened uterus would fail never left her during her pregnancy, she told the Journal.

'I can't explain how I felt. It was 
just a sense of being overwhelmed, wondering what happened to the baby, 
wondering what's happening to me and what did (the clinic) think they 
did,' she said. 'It was just constant stress.'

Knights visited the ER multiple times during the pregnancy, was admitted to the hospital four times, with each visit lasting around five days, and had bi-weekly ultrasounds at a doctor specializing in high-risk pregnancies.

In September, she delivered her daughter who they call the 'miracle baby' and thankfully both mother and daughter were healthy.

Knights said she still doesn't know why the abortion clinic doctor believed the procedure was complete and what, if anything, was removed from her body. She said she had two ultrasounds before the procedure but wasn't sure if one was done afterward.

Knights said she's hoping the to get some answers as her malpractice lawsuit against the clinic, and two doctors, makes its way through Summit County Common Pleas Court.

In a court filing, the clinic and doctors deny any negligence and challenge the lawsuit for various reasons, including that they say at least some of the claims are barred by the statute of limitations. They want the case dismissed.

knights is seeking unspecified damages of at least $25,000 for the pain, suffering and emotional distress she says the failed pregnancy has caused her.

But neither Knights or her fiance regret having their beautiful little girl in their arms.

'That's a sore subject to think about,' she told the Journal. 'I mean, it's just hard, thinking she's here and thinking, if they would have done their job... It's just something I don't like to think about.'
