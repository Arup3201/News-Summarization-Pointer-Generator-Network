A deer found himself a little out of his depth after hopping over a seven-foot fence  to take a refreshing dip in a backyard pool.

The buck scampered across several properties in Enchino, Los Angeles, before jumping into the backyard and becoming tangled in a pool cover.

The homeowner, Eric Munn, and two neighbors were able to pull the cover off, but the injured animal struggled to climb out of the pool and took several attempts to clamber to freedom.

The buck, nicknamed King by neighbors, was freed from the pool cover but took several attempts to clamber out of the pool in the backyard in Enchino, Los Angeles

The deer stayed in the backyard for around an hour before it headed off to another yard in the area

'The antlers had punctured the plastic pool cover and it was in a lot of distress. It was trying to fight the plastic pool cover and it was kind of drowning,' Mr Munn told ABC7.

The deer, nicknamed King by neighbors, stayed in the backyard for around an hour before it left and made its way to another yard.

When wildlife officials arrived they tranquilized the buck and have said they plan to release him back into the wild after treating his leg injury.

'He was a really beautiful animal and he was scared. It was good to be able to help him,' Mr Munn added.
