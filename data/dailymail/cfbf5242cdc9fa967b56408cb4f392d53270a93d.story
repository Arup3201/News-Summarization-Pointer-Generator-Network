Little boy Jack Baird is one of 20 children whose hopes of finding a cure to a rare disease have been dashed after a hoax ‘donor’ pledged £1million to charity before disappearing.

The hoaxer led the Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases (MPS) to believe that he would make the donation enabling the charity to conduct a drugs trial.

Two-year-old Jack was being considered for the scheme and it was only when MPS stopped receiving correspondence from the ‘donor’ that the Buckinghamshire-based charity realised they had been duped.

Distraught: Gemma Nelson had hoped her son Jack would be selected for the drugs trial

There are 150 in the UK who suffer from the deadly Sanfilippo condition, which causes severe mental and physical deterioration. 

Jack’s mother Gemma Nelson, 29, has branded the stunt as 'sick' but remains determined to continue fundraising for her son. 

The mother, who also has an older son Lewis, 9, said: ‘We were so happy. 

‘They said he wanted to remain anonymous so I just assumed it was a celebrity.’

Families of children with the rare condition had raised £100,000 towards funding the £600,000 treatment which would prolong their lives.

They believed they had struck gold when, following television coverage, one of the mothers received an email and a Facebook friend request from an anonymous potential donor, claiming to be a ‘self-made man’.

He offered to put up the remaining £500,000 needed to fund the trial, saying: ‘I’ve got my own kids and it’s what I would want for them.’

The other 18 families were also told about the offer.

In a series of communications, the 'donor' increased his offer to £1million, claiming he was 'so moved by the cause' that he wanted to support more children suffering with these devastating diseases. 

He told MPS that lawyers had been appointed and his bank had been instructed to arrange the donation.

Then, after claiming a mix-up had led to a delay in payment, correspondence suddenly stopped.

Another mother Gemma, from Ryhope, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I would never have thought someone would be cruel enough to do something like this. 

‘This makes us more determined to raise the full amount.’

There is no treatment available for the disease and those afflicted by the condition are not expected to live beyond their teens.

Determined to raise the money: Ms Nelson, along with other parents, have pledged to raise the money needed for the drugs trial despite the cruel hoax

A Genistein drug treatment is offering some hope for families as it has been shown to halt the progression of the disease in preclinical studies but needs to be clinically trialled before it can be prescribed in the UK. 

A spokeswoman for Wicked Genes, the fundraising branch of MPS, said: ‘Funding for clinical studies in children with ultra-rare diseases appears to be of little interest to major research funding bodies, and so Wicked Genes have taken it in to their own hands to raise the £600,000 needed.

‘The hoaxer maintained his cruel charade for over two weeks, regularly making contact with the charity and promising the money so the clinical trial could start immediately to save these children’s lives. 

‘Whilst the MPS Society was cautious, it also found it difficult to believe a hoaxer could act so immorally and chose such a vulnerable group of children and their families as his victims. 

‘Hopes raised of the clinical trial starting before Christmas have been heartbreakingly dashed.’

The hoax was reported to Thames Valley Police but they said no crime had been committed and they could not take further action.

If you would like to donate for the Genistein clinical trial, text GENE33 £2/£5/£10 to 70070 to help these families reach their target or contact the charity through their website at www.wickedgenes.co.uk
