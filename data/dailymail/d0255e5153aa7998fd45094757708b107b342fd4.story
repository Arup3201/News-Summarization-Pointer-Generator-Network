As Barcelona prepare for their pre-season game against Nice this weekend, Dani Alves is still hitting the beach.

The Barcelona and Brazil full-back was spotted relaxing on the beach in Miami and will return to pre-season training late after his World Cup exploits.

There has been considerable speculation as to where the 31-year-old will play his football next season but Alves has made it clear he wants to stay with the Catalan club.

After initially saying he could leave the club, Alves told Marca: 'I want to see out the contract that I signed. I'm very happy at Barça. We've had some wonderful years - the last few not so much - but it's time for us to enjoy the good times again at this club.'

Barcelona travel to France later this week for their friendly against Nice and will also face Napoli, HJK and Leon before kicking off the season against Elche on August 15.

The Catalan club are currently on a six-day training camp in England. Luis Enrique's side arrived at St George's on Friday without many of the star players, including Alves, but new captain Andres Iniesta, record appearance holder Xavi ad new singing Ivan Rakitic were all present.
