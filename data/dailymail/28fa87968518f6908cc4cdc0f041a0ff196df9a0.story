So what did we learn from Zoe Jordan? For a start, that sports-luxe will yet again dominate next summer for what feels like the hundredth time running.

But also that Zoe Jordan really is something quite special. This, and it's easy to forget it, is only her fifth outing but she already has a grasp of tailoring and colour of the sort that would make more established names proud.

And she showed both off to the full in a collection that combined a pitch-perfect palette with sleek silhouettes and wearable separates.

Sport meets street: Structured sporty silhouettes were lifted with flashes of colour and graffiti print

Minimal: Clean white or blush flatforms added glamour without overwhelming the excellent collection on show

Like Stella McCartney, like Phoebe Philo, like Balenciaga head honcho Alexander Wang, Jordan has an innate grasp of what women want before they know themselves.

Like them, she understands that a carefully calibrated palette of shimmering grey, delicate blush pink and fiery crimson lifts excellent tailoring out of the office and into must-have territory.

And like them, she does it beautifully. A case in point were the lovely dove-grey chiffon trousersÂ  teamed with a rugged waffle knit in muted oatmeal and given a fashionable edge with the help of a perfectly-tailored thigh-length white coat.

The blazer, a recurring piece, appeared in scarlet, paired with a delicate multi-layered minidress in a soft ombre that transitioned from black to grey to white before ending with bright crimson.

Showstopper: A column dress in pale grey and tomato red

In the pink: Blush gave the sporty look a shot of femininity

Accomplished: Jordan showed off her grasp of tailoring

Wearable: Jordan's perfectly chosen palette and well-executed styling brightened a gloomy Saturday morning

Delicate blush and dove-grey ombre 
popped up again and again, most daringly on a beautifully tailored 
slouchy trousers and blazer combo.

Inevitably, Jordan's trademark graffiti print put in an appearance: scaled down and mixed with charming doodles on a grey silk shirt dress and loud and proud in bold black lines on a body suit worn with a delicate pair of silvery shorts.

A robust sportiness kept dresses from becoming too girly, with a striped column in tomato and pale grey benefiting from discreet sheer panels and flashes of print.

Most
of what appeared was thoroughly wearable but more than that, everything
was utterly wantable and deserving of more than a rainy Saturday 
morning slot.

Although sports-luxe has become something of a recurring S/S trend, Jordan showed that repeats don't always have to be boring.

Her graffiti splattered, soft-hued vision for summer was proof that sporty summer separates still have fashion mileage, while her wonderful all-red finale did an excellent job of brightening up a gloomy Saturday morning. Roll on next summer.
