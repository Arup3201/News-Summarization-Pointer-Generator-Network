A huge crack in a cliff is threatening a luxury mansion at the same Texas spot where another vacation house had to be burnt down last year because it was so unstable.

There are now concerns that this home in a gated community could also collapse and crumble into Lake Whitney about 60 miles south of Fort Worth.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told NBC says it is 'very concerned with public safety' in light of the new crack.

A huge crack in a cliff is threatening a luxury mansion at the same Texas spot where another vacation house had to be burnt down last year because it was so unstable

There are now concerns that the home in a gated community could also collapse and crumble into Lake Whitney about 60 miles south of Fort Worth

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told NBC says it is 'very concerned with public safety' in light of the new crack

Neighbor Steve Mellgren told WFAA: 'It's getting larger... it's getting wider... it's getting deeper.'

He said recent rains have seen the crack open even further. 

'If it does happen... if anybody's near this cliff... it's going to be a problem for them,' he said. 'Could be loss of life.' 

There are buoys floating near the cliff, meant to keep boaters away. 

The Corps of Engineers said Tuesday it will work to 'keep things as safe as possible in the area until the danger has subsided.' 

Last year charred debris from a luxury cliff-side home fell 75 feet into a lake below after fire crews set the $700,000 retreat ablaze rather than wait for it to crumble into the water as the land faltered around it.

The White Bluff home was built on a fault line and was gradually collapsing with the cliff side into the lake 

It took less than an hour for the fire to level the home above Lake Whitney.

Flames consumed exterior walls after crews spread bales of hay and fuel to ignite flames throughout the expansive home.

The ground around the home cracked and became unstable until a part of the land gave way beneath the 4,000-square-foot home, leaving pieces of the house dangling off the side of a cliff. 

Authorities condemned the home and the owners, Robert and Denise Webb, consented to the burn.

Authorities said destroying the house was better than waiting for it to topple into Lake Whitney. 

The cost of removing mounds of debris from the lake could prove prohibitive.

Spectators in dozens of boats witnessed the demolition from a safe distance. 

The home is right next door to the one which was burnt down in June 2014 because it was so unstable 

Live television coverage shared the view of the spiraling black smoke coming from the gated resort community.

The Webbs purchased the home in 2012, but a few weeks ago were forced to remove their personal items and relocate. 

They expressed shock and sadness at losing their lake house.

The Webbs, who also have a home along Florida's Miami Beach, told WTSP-TV that the deterioration of their property has been hard to watch.

'You know, that's my life there that we're watching fall off,' Robert Webb said the day before the demolition.

Geologists and inspectors had told them before they purchased the land that the property was perfectly stable, 'and so we bought it in good faith,' Webb said.

The house, built in 2007, was to have been left to his grandchildren, he said.

'It's really tough, that house was special and I don't even know why it was so special but it was special to me,' Denise Webb said.
