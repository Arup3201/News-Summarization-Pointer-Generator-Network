Around 33 homes are being bought for more than £1million every day in England and Wales.Land Registry statistics reveal that in January this year there were 1,011 houses sold in this  price bracket.

This equates to 33 a day and is nearly double the 628 £1million-plus properties sold in the same month in 2013.

The number of buyers paying this much for a property – whether a family home or a buy-to-let investment – has risen by 61 per cent over the last year.

Seventy per cent of the seven-figure properties sold were in London, further evidence of the frenetic state of the capital’s housing market. The average price of a house in London now stands at an incredible £414,490.

But in the exclusive Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the Land Registry figures are even higher – there the average property sells for £1.24million.

Over the last year, house prices have risen by over 20 per cent in the London boroughs of Islington, Lambeth, Southwark and Waltham Forest. Even properties in areas formerly considered undesirable because of high crime rates and poor schools are now selling for more than £1million.

Around 400,000 people in Britain are thought to be ‘property millionaires’, which means their home is worth £1million or more, even if they have a large mortgage. Outside London, the highest proportion of property millionaires is in the affluent Surrey town of Virginia Water, where a third of all houses are worth over £1million.

Other property millionaire hotspots include the Buckinghamshire towns of Beaconsfield and Chalfont St Giles, according to the property website Zoopla.co.uk.

The property market boom looks like it will be here for the long-term – a separate report has predicted that by 2034 the average price of a home in England will be more than £900,000.

The study by accountants KPMG and housing charity Shelter warned that more and more people will be unable to afford a home of their own unless more houses are built. If property prices continue to rise as they have over the last 17 years, the cost of an average home in England will be £446,000 in 2024, ballooning to £903,000 ten years later, the research predicts.

At present, the average home in England costs around £225,000.

The report also warned that rocketing prices would prevent children flying the nest, as by 2040 half of those aged 20-34 will still be living with their parents.

However, the house price boom is not good news for first-time buyers, who are finding it increasingly difficult to get on the housing ladder

Marianne Fallon, UK head of corporate affairs at KPMG, said England’s housing market is ‘a big and messy problem’.

She said: ‘For many people, particularly those in their twenties, the aspiration of owning their own “castle” is fast becoming a fairy tale.’

Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, warned: ‘Our chronic shortage of affordable homes means that a generation face a future of living in their childhood bedrooms into their thirties.’

Companies’ ability to ‘attract and retain talent’ is also affected, according to KPMG, as young people are put off living and working in London by the astronomical cost of buying a property.

A senior official at the Bank of England last night also voiced concerns about rising property prices. Chief economist Spencer Dale said: ‘We know we should be nervous about what’s going on in the housing market.’
