A British aid worker was found beheaded and riddled with bullets on a roadside in Pakistan yesterday because his kidnappers have not been paid the ransom they demanded.

Khalil Dale, 60, was taken at gunpoint in January while he was working with the Red Cross in the south-west city of Quetta.

His head and body were discovered wrapped in a plastic bag with a note addressed to the chief of police, which read: 'This is the body of Khalil who we have slaughtered for not paying a ransom amount'.

Experienced: Dale had worked for the ICRC and the British Red Cross in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq before coming to Pakistan

Local police said the Pakistani Taliban had claimed responsibility.

David Cameron last night described 
the killing of Mr Dale, a Muslim convert who was also known as Ken, as a
‘shocking and merciless act’.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I was 
deeply saddened to hear today about the  brutal murder of Khalil Dale – a
man who was killed whilst providing humanitarian support to others.

‘This was a shocking and merciless 
act, carried out by people with no respect for human life and the rule 
of law. Khalil Dale has dedicated many years of his life to helping some
of the most vulnerable people in the world and my thoughts today are 
with his friends and family.’

The health programme manager from 
Dumfries, Scotland, was travelling home from a school in the troubled 
Baluchistan province in a clearly marked Red Cross vehicle when he was 
stopped and kidnapped.

He had been working in the country for a year after postings in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Friends said Mr Dale – who started 
his career as a nurse at Dumfries and Galloway Infirmary – had been 
planning to travel to Australia to marry his partner Anne, who he is 
believed to have met while working abroad.

He had previously returned to Scotland to look after his mother, Margaret, who died in 2007.  
Foreign Secretary William Hague said 
he learned of the death ‘with great sadness’, adding that ‘tireless 
efforts’ had been made to secure Mr Dale’s release.

Mr Hague said: ‘I utterly condemn the
kidnapping and killing of Mr Dale, and send my deepest condolences to 
his family and loved ones. This was a senseless and cruel act.’

Mr Dale’s brother Ian, who lives in 
New Zealand, travelled to Pakistan ten days after he was taken to try to
secure his release. At the time he said police had identified the group
involved.

Brutal: ¿A sharp knife was used to sever his head from the body,¿ said the doctor who first examined him

Speaking earlier this year to appeal 
for his release, Mr Dale’s step-niece, Justine Barber, 41, described him
as an honourable man doing an honest job.

She said: ‘He is a lovely man whose lifelong ambition has been to serve those less fortunate.’
Friends of Mr Dale last night described him as ‘an absolutely lovely guy’ who had devoted his life to caring for others.

Retired nurse Sheila Howat, a former 
colleague, said: ‘It’s dreadful what has happened to him, really awful. 
The world has lost someone who really cared for others.

‘I think the circumstances are absolutely barbaric and disgraceful. He did not deserve that end to his life.

‘I knew him as Ken, and he was an absolutely lovely person, devoted to caring for others less fortunate than himself.

‘He spent time in war-torn countries where help was needed and people were desperate, and that was Ken’s goal in life.’

She plans to contact other friends of
Mr Dale to arrange a memorial service in Dumfries where he was a member
of Friends of the Earth and the Coalition for Peace and Justice.

Mr Dale – who was born in York and was fluent in Arabic and Swahili – had been no stranger to danger.

On previous assignments with the Red Cross, he had been imprisoned and tortured and robbed at gunpoint.

In 1994, he was awarded an MBE for his humanitarian work in some of the world’s hot spots.

A Red Cross spokesman said it ‘condemns in the strongest possible terms this barbaric act’.

He added: ‘We are devastated. Khalil 
was a trusted and very experienced staff member who significantly 
contributed to the humanitarian cause.’

Police said Mr Dale’s body was found 
in an orchard near Quetta. Police chief Ahsan Mahboob verified details and wording of the note on 
his body.
