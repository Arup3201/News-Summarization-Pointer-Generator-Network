The combination of its size, natural origin, hue, and saturated colour makes it an extremely unusual stone. 

Another rare coloured diamond in the sale is the light pink square-cut diamond of 76.51 carats. Set as a necklace it's likely to fetch £4-6 million.

But if you're after a bargain, you could always try to nab a deal for just under a million with a necklace made from spinel, a type of gemstone made from magnesium.

The seven spinel beads date back to the 17th century to the time of Mughal emperors.

The gems were a symbol of the opulence and dignity of the empire, and were also treasured as protective talismans.

So if you have a birthday or anniversary coming up, or just feel you deserve a little treat, book your man on a plane to Geneva and you never know what treats he might find.
