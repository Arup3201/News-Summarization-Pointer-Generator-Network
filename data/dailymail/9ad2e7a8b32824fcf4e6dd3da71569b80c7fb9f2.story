Grilling: Chairman Lady Margaret Hodge said the evidence given by accountancy bosses was 'shocking' and 'laughable'

Britain's biggest accounting firms yesterday said they were ‘proud’ of making billions helping companies avoid UK tax.

In ‘shocking’ evidence to MPs, bosses told how they regularly advised wealthy corporate clients to use offshore havens and legal loopholes to minimise UK tax payments.

They admitted to having more than 200 offices in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands or Switzerland.

One even confessed to selling policies which had a high chance of later being declared unlawful in court.

Helping companies avoid tax earned them more than £2billion a year, said the four firms – KPMG, PWC, Ernst & Young and Deloitte.

The testimony was condemned as ‘shocking’ and ‘depressing’ by MPs on the public accounts committee.

Astonishingly, each of the executives in turn said they were ‘proud’ of their work.

Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PWC, said: ‘We are giving the best advice we can to clients on the options which they have.

‘I don’t see anything wrong with that.’

But committee chairman Margaret Hodge said Mr Nicholson’s company’s activity ‘stinks’.

She said the taxman had little hope of 
competing in a ‘David and Goliath’ battle against the accountancy giants
paid millions to help companies avoid tax.

Mr Nicholson yesterday admitted selling policies which had a 75 per cent chance of being later declared unlawful. Mrs Hodge replied: ‘I find that shocking.’

It also emerged that the companies all send senior tax partners to HMRC or the Treasury to help draft new legislation.

When they return to their firms, the companies use the new-found knowledge of loopholes to devise new ways for corporations to avoid paying full dues to the taxman.

Mrs Hodge said it was ‘depressing’ that such ‘clever’ people had chosen to work ‘in an area which reduces the available resources for us to build schools, hospitals and transport infrastructure’.

She told the companies they should be barred from receiving government contracts worth millions if they deliberately advised their wealthy firms and individuals to cut the tax they pay to the Treasury.

But the firms were unrepentant. Bill Dodwell, head of tax at Deloitte, said: ‘We help make the tax system work.’

Another boss, Jane McCormick of KPMG, insisted: ‘Our main purpose is to help our clients pay their tax’ – a statement Mrs Hodge described as ‘laughable’.

The four heads of tax were grilled for almost three hours in the House of Commons in the midst of huge public controversy over the low tax bills paid by multinationals such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks.

Dismissed: Jane McCormick from KPMG said her company's job was to 'help clients pay tax' - a claim Margaret Hodge described as 'laughable'

In his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Prime Minister David Cameron said there were ‘some forms of avoidance that have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical issues’.

He warned he would use Britain’s presidency of the G8 to press for action from the world’s most powerful governments.

But the firms denied their practices were ‘aggressive’ and were keen to distinguish between evasion – which is illegal and which they all said they would not engage in – and avoidance, which is taking advantage of incentives within the system.
