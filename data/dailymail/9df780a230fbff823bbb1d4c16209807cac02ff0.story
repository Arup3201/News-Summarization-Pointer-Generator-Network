Monday will be 'take your parent to work day' for radio presenter George Lamb as he will be joined by father Larry for a special broadcast.

The father and son are teaming up to help people love Mondays after research has revealed a quarter of adults get Monday morning blues.

The pair will present a one-off breakfast radio show that will be streamed live via www.quaker.co.uk from 7am on 9 December. But is it ever a good idea to work with family on a live show where tensions could be running high?

Early alarm call: Larry and George Lamb will be up with the larks to present a breakfast show on Monday morning

The pair insist there won't be any family fall outs despite the early start and fact George 
admits he 'can be grumpy in the morning'.

However the 33-year-old did confess he has been known to get 'petulant'
with his father in the past.

He told MailOnline: 'Luckily we do get on well. But once when
we were doing a TV show for ITV, I was grumpy and complaining and my 
dad kept saying 'come on, you're fine, this is what you have to do.'

'If a
colleague had been telling me what to do in those circumstances I would
have taken it on board. But as it was my dad I reverted to being like 
Harry Enfield's Kevin and became like a petulant teenager, shouting 'I 
don't want to!'

But he added that it's a privilege to be able to work alongside his theatrical father, 66.

Like father, life son: The pair said they get on well as they're 'both lairy'

George said: 'It 
happened by chance as I never intended to go into showbiz. But then I got some presenting work and dad was on EastEnders and 
Gavin and Stacey. Suddenly we were getting invited to all the same 
events and opportunities came up like this to work together.

'It is a 
rare and lovely thing to be able to share your profession with your 
parents and take them to work with you.'

Larry added that the father-son tables will be turned as it will be him learning the ropes from George as they broadcast from his home studio.

He said: 'My career has always been in TV 
and suddenly I'm going to be doing what my boy has been doing for years 
working on the radio.'

But the Lambs aren't the only father and son duo currently ruling the airwaves.

Comedian Jack Whitehall and his father, Michael, have been doing stand up comedy and their own TV show together.

Rise and shine: George and Larry will hope to brighten up Monday morning for the quarter of Brits who dread the start of a new week

Speaking of the pair, Larry said: 'I've seen their show and they have an interesting dynamic as they are a real contrast. Jack is so lively and out going and his dad is very low key.'

George chimes in that they contrast to them as 'we're both lairy'.

Explaining why they get on so well, George joked: 'We've always got on and have been like mates because when I was growing up my dad wasn't the disciplinarian. It was my mother who ruled the house with an iron fist!'

However the pair won't spend Christmas day together this year as both will be working - Larry on LBC Radio and George volunteering at Crisis at Christmas.

Larry admits he is something of a Scrooge so Christmas isn't preserved as special family time - especially as he has often had to work in the past over the festive season in pantomimes.

Hopeful: Larry said he would love a TV reunion with his on-screen son and wife, Mathew Horne and Alison Steadman, in Gavin and Stacey but it's in the hands of writers James Corden and Ruth Jones

George said: 'He's constantly ducking out of Christmas which isn't in keeping with his usual sunny disposition! So we won't spend Christmas day together but will have some family time at some point.'

Those living in hope of Larry one day returning to Christmas TV screens in a Gavin and Stacey special will be sadly disappointed though.

'There's more chance of getting kicked to death by a donkey on Southend Pier,' is how he put it. But the actor said he would be delighted if writers James Corden and Ruth Jones did decide to revive the much-loved sitcom - for a Christmas special, new series or even on the stage.

He said: 'Perhaps we might do a stage show in the future like Monty Python. I'm sure all the cast would jump at the chance for a TV reunion. I was talking to Alison Steadman (who played his wife on the show) the other day about how we would love to do it again, it was a wonderful part of all our lives.'

Meanwhile, Larry will content himself by trying to cheer up listeners on Monday with their radio show which will feature surprise celebrity guests, music and quirky themed segments.

George and Larry Lamb are working with Quaker Oats to kick start your week with Love Mondays FM. Quaker.co.uk/LoveMondays from 7am on Monday 9th December. A 45 minute 'best bits' podcast of all the show highlights will be available to download following the showon iTunes.co.uk
