She had every reason to be a blushing bride.

Elizabet Balogh was arrested on her ‘special day’ after accepting  a £400 payment to marry a  complete stranger.

But before Pakistani-born Asif Hussain could slip the ring on to her finger, immigration officials had  handcuffs on her wrist and she was led away in her one-shouldered white dress.

Blushing bride: Elizabeth Balogh being taken away by an official after being arrested at her sham wedding ceremony

Not so happy couple: Balogh was paid just £400 to marry Asif Hussain so that he could remain in Britain

Yesterday the 33-year-old was jailed, along with her intended husband and their matchmaker.

The scam was uncovered after the registrar became suspicious as Balogh and her 25-year-old fiancé exchanged little in the way of conversation ahead of their August wedding.

Prosecutor Hywel Hughes told Cardiff Crown Court: ‘It was  apparent that there was very little verbal communication between  the bride and groom'.

He said that it struck the registrar as ‘very odd’ that the  couple wanted to get married ‘as quickly as possible’ and had arranged the wedding in a  matter of weeks.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Balogh, who is originally from Hungary but has British citizenship, tried after her arrest to convince police that she really did want to marry Hussain, claiming: ‘It was love at first sight.’

Set-up: Elizabeth Balogh's cousin Valerie Farkas played the role of interpreter at the sham wedding

But the couple soon admitted that their relationship was fake,  and had been set up by Balogh’s cousin Valerie Farkas, 45, who played the role of interpreter.

The court heard that Hussain paid Balogh £400 to marry him after his student visa ran out.

He had hoped to stay in Cardiff to undertake a master’s degree  in business administration.

All three admitted conspiracy  to facilitate a breach of immigration law.

Judge Neil Bidder QC yesterday jailed Hussain, of Cardiff, for 12 months.

Balogh, a mother of one, and Farkas, a cleaner, both of  Manchester, were jailed for ten months and six months respectively.

The judge said: ‘The  registrar became suspicious that this was a fraud and a scam – although it didn’t require her to be very perceptive as Balogh and Hussain were unable to communicate with each other.

‘They didn’t share a common language and Farkas was needed to interpret. Not one of you realised how transparent a sham this was. ‘You all told police a pack of  lies – and Balogh telling them it was love at first sight was an  outrageous lie'.

He continued: ‘On the face of it, the person who would gain the most was Hussain, and he initiated this conspiracy. ‘But it is also clear that both women intended to gain financially through this'.

Chris Lovejoy, from the UK  Border Agency’s immigration crime team, said: ‘Asif Hussain saw this sham marriage as a shortcut to a life in the UK. ‘Instead, he has earned himself a significant spell behind bars.

‘This case shows how people are prepared to enter into a marriage with someone they barely know to help them cheat the immigration system in exchange for cash.

‘The UK Border Agency is cracking down on sham marriages and those who seek to cheat immigration laws face jail'.

The court heard that Balogh and Farkas had not told their families in Hungary that they had been arrested.

The judge told the women that the Home Secretary would decide whether they should be deported after their jail terms.
