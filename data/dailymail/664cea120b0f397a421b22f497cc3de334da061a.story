A nuclear power plant will be built in Britain for the first time in a generation after the EU finally signed off the project today – but will cost £8 billion more than expected.

The new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset will be funded by a levy on household electricity bills, amounting to around £8 a year, for 35 years.

Brussels had launched a probe into the project amid fears the £17.6billion government subsidy for French firm EDF to build the plant broke EU rules banning unfair ‘state aid’ for companies.

But the EU today revealed it had struck a deal with the Government to cut the subsidy by £1billion, giving the project the go ahead.

However, European commissioners revealed the costs of building the nuclear power station had rocketed by 50 per cent – before construction had even started.

Britain will get its first nuclear power station in a generation after the EU signed off on a deal with French firm EDF to build a reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset

The Government claimed the new power station would cost £16 billion to build. But the EU Commission, which has been examining the project since December, said the real cost would be £24.5billion.

The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power.

The nuclear power station is expected to begin operating in 2023.

The approval comes a year after headline terms of the subsidy contract were agreed by the UK government, guaranteeing EDF and its partners a price of £92.50 – twice the current market price of electricity - for each megawatt-hour of power that the reactors generate over a 35-year period.

Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: ‘After the Commission's intervention, the UK measures in favour of Hinkley Point nuclear power station have been significantly modified, limiting any distortions of competition in the Single Market.

‘These modifications will also achieve significant savings for UK taxpayers. On this basis and after a thorough investigation, the Commission can now conclude that the support is compatible with EU state aid rules.’

But Greenpeace slammed the agreement as a ‘world record sell out’.

David Cameron, at Hinkley Point B in Somerset last year,  claims the new nuclear power station  will create thousands of new jobs and cut energy bills

The environmental group's legal adviser Andrea Carta said: ‘There is absolutely no legal, moral or environmental justification in turning taxes into guaranteed profits for a nuclear power company whose only legacy will be a pile of radioactive waste. This is a bad plan for everyone except EDF.’

David Cameron has hailed the deal as 'a very big day for our country' and boasted that Hinkley Point C would be the first of many new nuclear power stations in Britain.

The Prime Minister added: 'The first time we’ve built a new nuclear power station for a very long time in our country. Other governments have promised it, they’ve failed to deliver it.

'This government has a long-term economic plan for Britain, and we’re delivering, including this vital nuclear power station which we hope will be the first of several other nuclear power stations, kickstarting again this industry, providing thousands of jobs and providing long-term safe and secure supplies of electricity far into the future.'

‘What this is an example of is government getting behind industries of the future that are a vital part of our long-term economic plan, that will provide secure and safe long-term supplies of electricity and energy for our country, and at the same time provide thousands of jobs.

'This is about long-term planning for our economy, for our energy security and for jobs. That’s what this is about.'

EDF will get a guaranteed price for the electricity it generates for decades, which will be added to household bills when the plant is up and running in ten years’ time.

Ministers argue that the plant will save consumers money compared with building offshore wind farms or importing gas from abroad.

The new power station, known as Hinkley C, will have two reactors. It is the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK since Sizewell B in Suffolk was completed in 1995.

The Government said building a new fleet of nuclear power stations could reduce bills by more than £75 a year in 2030.

At full capacity the two reactors could provide up to seven per cent of the country's energy needs.

Almost two-thirds of the nation's existing electricity generation is due to be turned off in the next 15 years, adding to the urgent need for new power plans, minister say.
