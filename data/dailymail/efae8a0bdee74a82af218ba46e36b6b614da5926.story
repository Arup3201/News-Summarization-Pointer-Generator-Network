'Firefighters are still working hard at the scene to try and bring the blaze under control. We now have water jets attacking  the fire from the four corners of the building.

'We evacuated 30 people from inside the museum and firefighters will be making efforts to salvage as many of the artefacts as possible.'

Major blaze: Flames and smoke billow out of the roof of the public library in Walworth, Southwark

The London Fire Brigade was called at 12.28pm and fire engines are expected to remain at the scene for at least the next few hours.

It’s not known at this stage how the blaze started.

A spokeswoman for Southwark Council told MailOnline: 'We do not have full access yet. The firefighters are still there doing their job and it may be a few days before we know the full extent of the damages to the museum.'
