New York’s long-awaited bike sharing service finally launched on Monday, but not without teething problems for users including difficulties getting the bikes in and out of their racks and complaints about the smartphone app not functioning correctly.

The Citi Bike share program was launched on Monday morning by Mayor Bloomberg.

By 7p.m. that night the bulky blue bikes had been rented out more than six thousand times and cyclists had pedaled a combined distance of almost 14,000 miles.

New York City's bike sharing system is finally off the ground but many users are unhappy about the service they've received so far

However the launch was not without its issues for some customers. One man told the New York Post he was worried he might be fined after he couldn't get a second bike out during the first day of the service.

‘When I put my card in to get another bike, it gave me red,’ fumed Yong Zhu, 40. ‘I tried another rack, and it gave me red. I can’t get any out. Now I’m afraid that it is going to give me a $1,000 fine!’

Others have complained that it is too difficult to manoeuvre the bikes in and out of their docking stations. ‘You literally have it ram it,’ said Eddie Bricker, 24.

DeNorval Parks, 52, had the opposite problem and without a key card or any excessive force was able to remove a bike from a docking system.

Once the bike scheme is fully operational there will be about 330 stations in Manhattan and Brooklyn and thousands of bicycles for rent

Most popular bike stations on Day 1:

‘You saw me! I didn’t use any excessive force; it just came right out!,’ he told The Post.

Another user, Cynthia Grayson, 30, said she was disappointed that the smartphone app wasn’t working properly.

‘The roll-out was poorly planned. The app wasn’t working correctly... They didn’t have people at the stations,’ she complained.

Some 16,000 people having signed up to become annual members for $95 a year, but many have complained that they still haven't received their key card.

Non-members will have to wait until 
June 2 to saddle up on one of the 6,000 bikes at the 330 stations that 
will be open by then.

‘We
now have an entirely new transportation network without spending any 
taxpayer money,’ Bloomberg gushed at the news conference.

The
first $825 bike was stolen in Manhattan on Sunday evening as the 
vehicles were being delivered to their docking stations - and the crook 
got away on two wheels.

Meanwhile,
genuine users are being forced to wait to try out the brand-new rental 
bikes, as hundreds of key cards for the scheme apparently went missing 
in the post.

Test run: Mayor Bloomberg tried out a Citi Bike for size at the launch of the program on Monday morning. But the first days of the scheme have suffered a number of hiccups

Ready to use: The New York City Citi Bike sharing scheme finally began on Monday, but the launch had its fair share of problems, including a theft while the bike were being delivered

Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Transportation Commissioner Janette 
Sadik-Khan christened the beginning of bike-sharing at a docking 
station near the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday morning.

But the first blue bike thief struck at around 6pm on Sunday. Workers were installing the vehicles in a station at Second Avenue and 25th Street when someone made off with with a shiny new bike.

The
crew only noticed the missing bike when a passer-by yelled at them and 
after initially trying to chase the crook on foot they alerted NYPD 
officers in the area.

'A 
cop car was passing by and the workers said, 'Stop, stop, we've just 
been robbed,'' Bolivar Arellano told the Post. The thief - and the 
missing bike - have yet to be tracked down.

A Citi Bike spokesman would not comment on the incident.

Difficult start: Officials hope to expand to 10,000 bikes and 600 docking stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens

Easy access? Hundreds of early adopters of the program are frustrated that their key cards for the scheme have not arrive. Citi Bike says they were lost in the post

Hundreds of other users have been left frustrated by their key cards for the scheme not arriving in time for the big launch.

A Citibike official told Gothamist 
that the problems were due to 'postal service delay' and 'incorrect or 
incomplete addresses.'

'Out of 11,000 (keys), a few hundred got lost,' Dani Simons, the program's director of marketing, told the Post.

The program is attempting to correct the
situation by allowing users to pick up keys at the Citi Bike 
headquarters in Brooklyn and at a tent on the south side of Union Square in Manhattan.

Scores of early adopters, who signed up before May 17, took to Twitter to voice their frustrations.

One user said on Monday: 'I signed up on 4/17, 
but still no key (mail already came today). So far been on hold on your 
customer service number for 20m!'

Another would-be cyclist added: 
'Still have not received my #CitiBike key despite numerous promises! 
Thanks @CitibikeNYC way to screw up the launch!'

Heist: A crook stole a brand new bike from a docking station on Sunday evening. The thief, and the bike, are still at large

The privately funded program will launch with 
6,000 bikes at 330 docking stations in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn.

Officials hope to expand to 10,000 bikes and 600 docking stations in 
Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.

On Friday, the blue bicycles started appearing in docking stations throughout the city.

More than 9,000 people who have signed up for the program are technically 
able to start riding on Monday. The bikes will be available to anyone 
starting June 2.

An annual membership costs $95 and a day pass will cost $9.95.
