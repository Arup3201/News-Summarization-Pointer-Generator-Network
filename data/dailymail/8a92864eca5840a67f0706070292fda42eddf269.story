The parents of two kindergarteners who 
allegedly wandered from their classroom and boarded a subway car for two
hours say it was a neighbour who first spotted and notified them and not their school.

It was a neighbour's frantic phone call that notified the parents of Ameen Smith, 5, and Zavier McIntyre, 6, after seeing the boys wandering the streets of Philadelphia alone.

'To say that my son's there even though you don't know if he's there or not,' Zavier's mother Marsheedah Thomas told NBC10 of the school's handling. 'I had to call you to make sure, to see that my son was there.'

Recovered: Ameen Smith, 5, and Zavier McIntyre, 6, both kindergarteners at M. Hall Stanton School were found on the streets of Philadelphia after wandering from their classroom

The boys' teacher at M. Hall Stanton School admitted to having seen the pair leave her classroom around 11.30 but said she didnâ€™t give chase so as to not leave her other students alone.

The teacher is said to have instead called the school's front desk to report the boys' exit whose front door was unmanned by a parent volunteer at the time.

'These kids walked right past the office out the front door and nobody seen it,' Zavier's grandmother Phylis Thomas told NBC10. 'Something needs to be done in that school.'

Both boys were recovered safely about a mile away after the parents say they rode the Broad Street Line subway.

The school argues that, however, stating that the boys walked to Broad Street and Allegheny Ave on their own, never getting on a train.

An hour after a frantic search for their sons, police reunited the boys with their mothers back at the school.

A school district spokesman told NBC10 that an investigation is underway with Ameen's mother Kishia Smith saying she will be following up to ensure it doesn't happen again.
