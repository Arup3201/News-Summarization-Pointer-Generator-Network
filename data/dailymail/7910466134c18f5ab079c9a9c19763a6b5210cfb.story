A mother-of-two was shamed into losing more than 18 stone after getting stuck on a theme park ride.Becky Edwards was left a laughing stock when she became wedged in a carriage ride while enjoying a day out with her family three years ago.

The 30-year-old from Cannock, Staffordshire, was so humiliated by her mishap that it forced her to change her unhealthy lifestyle - and lose more than half her body weight.

She said: 'It was the most embarrassing day of my life. Everyone was staring at me. People were laughing and pointing at me.

'In a way, I'm glad it happened. I don't think I would have done anything about my weight otherwise.'

'It was the most embarrassing day of my life': Becky will never forget the moment she became stuck in a theme park ride

Healthy: Supermarket worker Becky once used her discount card to buy pork pies and sweets - now she eats low fat foods and grills instead of fries

Becky, who is a full-time mother, ballooned to a dress size 32 and a whopping 33 stone after years of gorging on junk food.

She said: 'It started when I was in my late teens and I moved out of home into my own flat. I stopped eating proper meals.

'I got a job in Safeway and used my discount card to buy crisps, chocolates and cream cakes every day. I would stuff myself.

'I was working shifts and on my way home from work, I'd stop off at the chip shop.'

On an average day, Becky would eat three bags of crisps, two chocolate bars, sandwiches, a pizza, sausage rolls, pork pies and Cornish pasties.

Her weight spiralled out of control after she met husband Gary, 34, a factory worker, and gave birth to their daughter Lilly, now six.

Becky said: 'When Lilly was a toddler, I started dieting. I tried different things - Weight Watchers, Slimfast - but nothing worked for me.

'I was always hungry and would fill up on anything I could grab. I was probably eating the same amount.

'I just got it into my head that I would never lose weight. I just thought ‘that's me' and hid myself in baggy clothes.

'I didn't own a full length mirror. I didn't want to see myself.'

It wasn't until the day out at Drayton Manor Theme Park in Staffordshire that Becky got the wake-up call she needed.

She said: 'Lilly was only three at the time and she wanted to go on every ride. I always avoided them.'I used to come up with excuses but she begged me to go on the cars with her. I didn't like seeing her upset so I gave in.

Super mum: Thirty-three stone Becky Edwards was humiliated into losing more than half her body weight after getting stuck on a roller coaster at Drayton Manor theme park.

'As we went round, the wheel was cutting into my stomach. It was very uncomfortable.

'When the ride finished, I tried to stand up but I realised I was stuck.

'Lilly sat there waiting for me to get off. She shouted: ‘come on Mum, hurry up.' She wanted to go on the other rides. She was young and didn't understand what was happening.

'It was so embarrassing. My biggest fear was that they would have to call the fire brigade to cut me out.'

After several minutes, Becky finally managed to free herself.

She said: 'It felt like I was stuck forever.

'I grabbed Lilly's hand and walked towards Gary. There was a crowd of people looking at me.'I was hot and my face was bright red.

'Gary had seen everything but he knew it was best not to mention anything. We never talked about my weight. I think he was worried about upsetting me.

'After that, I refused to go on any more rides.'

Liberating: Now Becky says she can go on any children's rides she likes

On the journey home, Becky tried to make a joke out of her misfortune.

She said: 'I laughed it off. I said it was a kid's ride and adults shouldn't go on it but I was struggling to hold back the tears.

'As soon we got home though, I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. It really upset me.

'I hated my body and was ashamed at how fat I'd let myself get.'

She also realised that her bad relationship with food could have fatal health implications.

'I was always breathless and at risk of having a heart attack.

'I'd cook a healthy meal for Lilly and Gary but I wouldn't eat it myself. I was setting a bad example.

'I decided I needed to do something if I wanted to see her grow up. I didn't want to leave her without a mum.'

Becky joined her local Slimming World group and within a month she had lost a stone and a half.She said: 'You can eat what you want but you change how you cook things. I don't use oil and I grill everything.

'Anne my Slimming World leader has been brilliant. When I'm struggling she will always helps me. The group is like one big family. We all look after each other.

'When I fell pregnant with my son Harry, I had a break from Slimming World and put on two stone but as soon as he was born, I was back again.'

In total, dropped nine dress sizes and has slimmed down to a healthier 14 stone. She hopes to lose a further two stone to reach her target.

Becky says she still has flashbacks to that day but it hasn't stopped her going to the theme park.

She said: 'We went to Drayton Manor a couple of weeks ago and I went on everything.

'Lilly said to me the other day: ‘You used to be fat, Mummy, but now you're not.'

'It made me feel so proud.'
