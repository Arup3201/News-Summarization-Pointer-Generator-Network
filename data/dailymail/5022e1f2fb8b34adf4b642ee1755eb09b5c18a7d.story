Police look for the bodies of Pete Luciano, 41, and son Jordan, 13. Both drowned in the Wissahickon Creek in Pennsylvania on Friday afternoon

The inn used a landline to contact dispatches, since cell phone service is  spotty in the area. By the time police arrived, it was too late. Both bodies were pulled from the water around 4pm in an area of the creek known as 'Devil's Pool,' NBC Philadelphia reports. Michelle Luciano, a mother of 8 from the Hunting Park neighborhood in Philadelphia, was separated from her husband, but only had kind words for him in the wake of tragedy. 'I will always have the deepest love for him [and] respect to know that he risked his life to save our child,' she told WPVI.

She added that it was her son Justin who attempted to save his family members' lives. 'I know he's hurting but Justin has this tough interior,' Luciano said.

Though often ignored, warnings signs are posted near the area due to shallow waters instantly dropping. It is illegal to swim in the area of the Wissahickon Creek where both Lucianos were found, NBC Philadelphia says. “The depth of this particular waterway varies and changes very suddenly and you cannot really anticipate that,” said Sullivan to CBS Philadelphia. Jordan's older brother plans to petition the city seal dangerous creeks and rivers off to prevent future deaths. Funeral arrangements have yet to be made for father and son.
