A female victim of the horrific Bourbon Street shooting spree last weekend has become the first person to die as a result of her wounds, authorities said.

Brittany Thomas, 21, from Hammond, Louisiana, passed away Wednesday, according to her family. A total of 11 people were shot during the early Sunday morning shooting on the iconic New Orleans street, according to police.

Her death came on the same day the New Orleans Police Department announced it was looking to speak to 20-year-old Justin Odom, WGNO reported. He later turned himself in and was booked on unrelated charges.

Thomas and three other victims - an 18-year-old man, a 19-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man - were the only ones still hospitalized after the terrifying ordeal, according to WDSU.

Odom is often seen with another male by the name of Josh or Joe, who cops have also called a 'person of interest,' according to WGNO.

Investigators have not any luck tracking the other man down and are asking for the public's help locating them.

A 21-year-old woman from Australia who was shot in the face during the fracas told a Perth television station she is lucky to be alive after coming within centimetres of death.

Amy Matthews and a friend were celebrating their graduation from the University of WA when they were caught in the crossfire of a gunfight between two men on Sunday at 2.45am.

The pair had been walking on New Orleans' main tourist strip, Bourbon Street, when Ms Matthews was one of nearly a dozen innocent bystanders injured.

The bullet entered Ms Matthews' right cheek and shattered most of her teeth and bottom jaw, before ripping her tongue open and coming out the top of her lip.

'Four centimetres higher or lower and I definitely wouldn't be talking to you today,' she told Nine News.

'I'm definitely counting my lucky stars for sure.

'I mean the surgeons came in and said it's not every day we get to see someone sitting up and talking to us just after they have been shot in the face.'

Two US Marines stayed with the pair on the street until an ambulance arrived.

'I was trying not to freak out too much and the marines were trained in that so they were keeping my mind off those thoughts,' Ms Matthews told the West Australian.

'They were making jokes and telling me how I was handling it better than most of their marine friends would have. They definitely helped.'

She was taken to Interim LSU Hospital where it took 30 stitches to sew her tongue back together and she had a metal support fixed to the roof of her mouth.

Ms Matthews is expected to face multiple surgeries, including bone grafts, as part of her recovery.

She and her friend had flown to the US in March for a gap-year holiday after completing her bachelor of arts and majoring in political science and economics.

The pair had already visited New York and Nashville, before they hired a car to drive to New Orleans.

Police are still searching for the two men who exchanged gunfire and it remains unclear what sparked the shooting, WWL-TV, New Orleans reports.

'This is a heinous crime. This is two young men, both armed with firearms, who chose to settle a dispute between themselves without a moment's care for anyone else,' New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Ronal Serpas said.
