A woman who made more than 250 time-wasting 999 calls, swearing at phone operators and even making a threat to kill, has narrowly avoided being given an anti-social behaviour order (Asbo).

June Chadwick, 53, would ring the police when drunk and report crimes she had read about in the paper or seen on the television, a court heard.

She was given a six-month community order with supervision, and ordered to pay £35 costs.

In court: June Chadwick made more than 250 time-wasting 999 calls, swearing at phone operators and even making a threat to kill

Chadwick's calls to the emergency services each lasted between one and 18 minutes, Oldham Magistrates' Court was told.

But a district judge turned down a request for her to be given an Asbo, which would have meant she faced jail if she made another time-wasting call.

Threatening: June Chadwick was warned that she would be given an Asbo if she made another time-wasting call to the emergency services

Chadwick, of Falkirk Street, Greenacres, Oldham, admitted using the public communication network to cause annoyance, inconvenience and anxiety.

She made the calls between August 2010 
and October 2011. One of them, which was played to the court, included 
swearing and a threat to kill.

The court heard that Chadwick suffered from mild mental health issues and had delusional ideas.

Chris Fallows, defending, said: 'Most of the calls were made because my client had a real concern that people in the UK were suffering and being killed by acts of violence.

'She had seen them on television and seen them in the paper and called the police.

'Her intention was to assist the police.'

District Judge James Prowse said Chadwick’s condition would make it difficult for her to distinguish between a hoax and genuine call for help.

But he warned that any further nuisance phone calls would see her almost certainly facing an Asbo.

He told her: 'If it doesn’t stop, you’ll be back.

'If you carry on with these phone calls,
even if there is not a criminal prosecution, the court would certainly 
make it (the order).'

Chadwick's case was heard less than three weeks after another nuisance 999 caller avoided a jail sentence.

Yasmin Adams, 21, who made more than 100 threatening 999 calls in only six days, told police she did it because she was 'bored'

She repeatedly warned call operators that she was going to 'smash up' police cars and attack officers with pepper spray.

Officers arrested Adams after they traced the calls to her home in Fenton, Staffordshire.

She appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates' Court earlier this month and admitted persistently making use of a public communication network to cause annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety.

She was given a 24-month community order with a supervision requirement, and ordered to pay £85 costs.

In July, Humberside Police officers spent hours dealing with a hoax call after couple from Hull claimed their three-year-old daughter had gone missing after a day at the beach in Hornsea, East Yorkshire.

It later transpired that the couple were childless, had been out drinking, and called emergency services because they wanted a lift home.

Police were alerted after the couple approached a man in Hornsea and asked to be driven back to Hull.

They told the man that their three-year-old daughter had gone missing had been advised by police to return home.

But instead of driving them to the city, the man took them to his house and contacted police, sparking a huge search for the little girl.
