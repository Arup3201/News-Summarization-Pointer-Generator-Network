This is a glimpse inside Rosie O'Donnell's five-bedroom mansion in Nokomis, Florida, that has hit the market for $5.75 million.

With a heated pool, four-car garage, 100 feet of beachfront and a dock for a boat, the abode is described in a listing as 'consummate luxury'.

It is the latest in a series of major life changes for the talk show presenter, who last week resigned from The View to focus on her five children after divorcing her wife of two years Michelle Rounds.

In December, O'Donnell sold her New York City apartment for $9 million, and was looking for buyers for four properties in upstate New York.

Changes: O'Donnell last week resigned from The View to focus on her five children after divorcing her wife of two years Michelle Rounds. The talk show host has sold her New York apartment and is looking for other properties north of the city 

Now, it's the gated Gulf-front family home that is getting let go.

O'Donnell and Rounds bought the property in Nokomis, Florida, in 2013.

Palm trees surround the outdoor area which has numerous patios and balconies, and a landscaped garden.

Inside, French oak lines the heated floors.

The kitchen has a breakfast bar and a walk-in pantry, and one of the five full bathrooms features a hot tub.

For those wearied by trekking around the 5,000-square-foot property, an elevator is installed to ride between the three floors.

There is access to the marina and the waterfront, where would-be buyers can moor their boats.

O'Donnell has listed the house on Realtor.com for $5.75 million, having reportedly bought it for $5 million. 

The sale is being represented by real estate agents Jill Friedman and Kevin Vale.

Her publicist, Cindi Berger, announced last week that the outspoken co-host of the ABC daytime chat show is exiting next week to focus on her five children after the breakup of her marriage.

Berger says O'Donnell and Michelle Rounds, her wife of three years, split in November. 

The 52-year-old O'Donnell had returned to The View only last summer. Her initial yearlong stay ended stormily in 2007.

Now in its 18th season, the program recently was the target of rumors that a fellow panelist, Rosie Perez, had left for good to appear in a new Broadway play. But she returned this week.

Moderator Whoopi Goldberg and Nicolle Wallace remain with Perez on the show, which was created by Barbara Walters in 1997. 

Easy access: The kitchen opens out into a living area which has glass doors leading out to the seafront 

Comfort: One of the bedrooms has a balcony with a seaview and a widescreen television mounted on the wall
