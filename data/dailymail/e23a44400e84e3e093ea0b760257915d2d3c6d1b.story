Four synchronised swimmers have been picked for the new England team after being trained by their mothers - who all represented the nation in the same sport in the 1980s.

Isabelle Thorpe, Corrie Leach, and sisters Kate and Chloe Shortman impressed selectors and will be competing for England around the world this year.

Their mothers all trained and competed together three decades ago and now coach from the poolside at Bristol South Swimming Pool.

L-R, Chloe Shortman, 14, Corrie Leech, 17, Izzy Thorpe, 12, and Kate Shortman, 12, have just qualified for the England Synchronised swimming team after being coached by their mothers

Corrie's mother Georgina, 47, was in the England team in the 1980s - aged 14 to 22 - and won medals in European competitions with her elegant routines.

Her daughter Corrie, who started the sport at aged 10, reckons her mother gives pretty good advice.

The 17-year-old said: 'When I found out I was so proud of myself and really excited thinking about the future in the team.

'It is quite good having your mum as a coach. She can be funny on the side of the pool and I'm like "oh mum". She is a strict coach, you could say.'

Georgina, a bookmaker, added: 'I think the main strength I can bring is that I have been there and I know what to expect.

'But I always tell Corrie to just make the most of the experience and take it all in.'

Karen Thorpe, 40, said coaching daughter Isabelle, 12, is tough because she knows how much work is needed - but still wants her daughter to have a normal life.

Karen, a syncro talent development officer, started swimming as a teenager and became GB captain at the end of a ten year career.

She said: 'It was amazing. I travelled the world - all over Europe, America, Canada, New Zealand.

'It is a complete nightmare coaching Isabelle. I can see the potential in her but I feel like I want to be her mother, not her teacher, and not just talking about synchro all the time.

The four swimmers impressed selectors and will be representing England this year in competitions around the world and will all be competing at the Croatian Open in June

'But it is a balance, because I know to succeed you need to be so driven and focused 100 per cent.'

Karen performed a duet in Team GB with fellow coach Maria Shortman, whose daughters Chloe and Kate have now qualified to represent their nation.

Maria, 42, who is a full-time synchro coach, swam for around eight years for England until she was 21.

Chloe, 14, said: 'It's good swimming with my sister.' Kate, 12, added: 'Well, sometimes we have arguments in the middle of a routine, but it is normally ok.'

Corrie is in the juniors section of the England team, while Chloe, Isabelle and Kate are in the under-15s.

Chloe is off to the French Open in two weeks time, and they will all be competing at the Croatian Open in June.
