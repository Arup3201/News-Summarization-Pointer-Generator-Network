She shot to instant fame after posting a series of racy selfies online, attracting praise from some for making politics sexy while other criticised her for cheapening it. 

But now Karen Danczuk, the wife of MP Simon Danczuk, 47, has decided to sell signed pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay.

The 31-year-old mother of two and Rochdale councillor said she decided to bow to public demand and sell the  pictures of herself for £10, which she insists is simply good business sense and a way of interacting with people. 

Mrs Danczuk has promised each photo will be signed, scented and personally sent and is already having to order more copies after she sold 400 in less than 24 hours and attracted more than 4,000 views to the listing.

Karen Danczuk, a councillor in Rochdale and the wife of MP Simon Danczuk, is selling this selfie, showing her cleavage, on eBay for £10 which she says will be signed, scented and personally sent by her

The selfie is on sale for £10 on eBay and will be personally signed and scented by the Rochdale councillor

According to the eBay listing each photo, which features the councillor in a bikini top and sunglasses, is sprayed with her favourite Chanel perfume.

'I decided to do it because I was getting a lot of messages online asking me for signed picture,' Mrs Danczuk told MailOnline. 

'I'm just naturally business minded and decided it would make sense.' 

Mrs Danczuk had started offering a picture free to buyers of her old clothes, which she had found when she cleared out her wardrobe after losing half a stone. 

But she said 'demand' meant she had decided to sell just the photos on their own.

She added: 'I chose it because I think it's just a nice natural photo. It's makeup-free and it's not overtly provocative or sexual. I thought if people want it why not do it. 

'I've had a lot of interest and didn't actually think it would be this popular. I've suddenly realised it's less than two weeks to Christmas and I'm going to be spending my time signing and sending out selfies.' 

Mrs Danczuk said her husband didn't mind her selling the photo and was used to her taking a business-like attitude. 

Mrs Danczuk has become known for posting a number of selfies, particularly charting her exercise regime 

But she said she feared she may need to order more pictures as she has already sold more than double the 200 she had printed.

She also said she had decided to spray the photos with her favourite Chanel scent, likening the idea to the scented love letters people used to post.  

The councillor has become known as 'Mrs Selfie' for the number of snaps of herself she regularly posts online, particularly tracking her exercise regime. She has posted dozens of selfies in recent months and more than 60 since July.

Her selfies have seen her rise to fame, gaining more than 20,000 followers in just a few months.

Mrs Danczuk has posted a number of cleavage baring selfies on her Twitter account but said the pictures she has been sharing were 'not meant to be sexy' after the councillor was accused of cheapening politics 

But the publicity has also come with its downsides. In August former Conservative MP Louise Mensch described her as 'Westminster's most embarrassing wife' and claimed she was cheapening politics for constantly posting pictures of her cleavage. 

Her husband however defended his wife at the time, posting on Twitter: 'Proud of my wife — brains and beauty!'

And Mrs Danczuk, who owns a deli with a husband, said the pictures were 'not meant to be sexy.'

She added: 'I've never done a full bikini shot and a lot of my pictures are make-up free. This is something I just do in my own time. 

The mother of two has posted more than 60 selfies in the last six months to her more than 25,000 followers 

Mrs Danczuk married Labour MP Simon Danczuk  in 2012 and the couple, of Rochdale, have two young sons

The councillor said she had bowed to demand to sell the selfie, after first offering it free with old clothes

'I'm very expressive as a person and I think these pictures just help to build up a picture of me. It's where we are as a society. 

'It's a way of taking the blankness out of life when people are often too standoffish. At the end of the day it is just a postcard.

'A lady even said to me the other day it was "so nice for Rochdale to be associated with glamour."'  

Mrs Danczuk married Mr Danczuk in 2012 and the pair have two sons, Milton, six, and Maurice, four.
