Celebrating: Talhat Rehman gives the V for victory sign at Southwark Crown Court after he was spared jail today

A butcher Tasered by police outside Buckingham Palace as he held a carving knife to his own throat while demanding to deliver a letter to the Queen has been spared jail today.

Talhat Rehman, 55, sparked terror among tourists after holding the eight-inch blade to his throat during the Changing of the Guard ceremony screaming 'I want to die'.

Rehman then pressed a second knife to his chest while threatening to kill himself and this afternoon was given a year of mental health treatment instead of a prison sentence.

He was heard to say ‘stay back, I will do it, I will do it’ before being Tasered with 50,000 volts and being disarmed by police on February 3 this year.

Rehman, a father-of-five and grandfather of 18 was considering threatening the Queen and killing his own family in despair at an ongoing legal dispute, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The former owner of Kassam Halal Meat in Kingsbury, north west London, wanted to appeal to Her Majesty directly over claims a solicitor stole £168,000 from him.

But the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were at their Sandringham Estate in Norfolk at the time.

Rehman admitted two counts of knife possession and was ordered to undergo mental health treatment.

Judge Alistair McCreath said: ‘This is a man whose mental health has been shattered by life’s events.

‘I am perfectly satisfied that whatever impression he may have given through his movements and actions, he had no intention to harm anyone except himself.’

He continued: ‘You were genuinely convinced you have been denied justice by legal manipulation on the part of a person you believed defrauded you.

‘This belief has become almost obsessional with you to the point where it has driven you mad.’

Smartly dressed in a black suit, white shirt and red tie, Rehman bowed his head after sentence and simply said: "Yes" when asked if he agreed to a 12-month mental health treatment and supervision order.

The judge added: ‘Just don’t ever do this again, it’s stupid so far as you’re concerned and it’s not great for the public having to see people doing what you were doing.’

Rehman had crossed into a ‘sterile area’ cordoned off by police to members of the public before being Tasered, the court heard.

‘He placed a kitchen knife to his throat with his right hand, and had another kitchen knife in his left hand, which he had held to chest,’ said prosecutor Peter Zinner.

‘Mr Rehman was then heard to repeatedly shout that he was going to kill himself.

‘Officers were alarmed by the incident as were members of the public.

‘Officers were told by him “stay back, stay back or I will do it.”

‘At that stage, other police officers were alerted and observe the defendant repeatedly thrust the knives towards his throat and chest.

‘Police genuinely believed he wanted to kill himself.

‘He was shouting “I want to die.”

‘Police armed themselves with Tasers and tried to get the defendant to calm down and thrown down the knives.

‘He continued to make threats and one stage appeared to lunge towards one of the officers, slashing the knives in a slashing movement.

‘At that stage police had no choice but to deploy Taser.’

Rehman dropped to the ground before he was formally arrested and restrained.

He admitted he had taken the enormous carving knives from a butcher’s shop owned by his son.

Rehman has a history of mental illness and a background of ‘psychotic episodes’.

After the incident, it emerged Rehman, who has a history of psychotic episodes, wanted to appeal directly to the Queen for help after he lost £170,000 in a botched business deal

The court heard how Rehman fell to the floor after being shocked and officers were able to retrieve the knives

Mr Zinner said: ‘He was admitted to hospital for treatment last year.

‘Discharge notes suggest he had been having difficulties in relation to a previous business arrangement he had with a solicitor who he blames for current or ongoing financial difficulties.

‘When he was discharged from Park Royal Hospital he was also having thoughts about killing his family, making threats to the Queen and taking his own life.

‘Delusions or not, beyond that the crown is gravely concerned for the protection of the public and for himself.’

Gillian Frost, defending, said Rehman genuinely believed he had been ripped off.

His family claim he lost his savings and business after being defrauded in a property deal by a lawyer who is no longer believed to be practicing.

Rehman was told by police to fight a civil case due to insufficient evidence to prosecute the solicitor.

‘It is clear this has placed a great deal of pressure on him,’ said Ms Frost.

Rehman, of Kenton, north west London, admitted two counts of having an article with a blade or point.

A further charge of affray was dropped after prosecutors offered no evidence.

He was sentenced to a 12-month community order, including treatment at Central Middlesex Hospital by mental health professionals and supervision by the probation service during the same period.
