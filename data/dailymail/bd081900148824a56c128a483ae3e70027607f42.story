Murdered: Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, was killed during a car-jacking in September 2011

A successful businessman bled to death in a quiet residential street after he was stabbed by a car thief trying to steal his beloved Mercedes.

Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, was sat in his parked car in Ilford, Essex, with a female friend when he was attacked in September, 2011.

Mr Bhurji, known as Raj, was stabbed in the heart after he refused to hand over the keys to his Mercedes SLK, a court heard today.

Two young men, aged 23 and 21, appeared in court today charged with his murder.

The assailant approached the car shortly after midnight on September 13, 2011 and after dragging Mr Bhurji’s female friend out of the passenger seat, demanded the keys to the Mercedes, the Old Bailey was told.

Mr Bhurji, from Ilford, who ran his own garage, told the carjacker he did not have the keys and threw them behind the driver’s seat, the court heard.

In response, the knifeman stabbed Mr Bhurji in the heart, but before he collapsed, he was able to reach for the keys and hand them over to the thief.

The Mercedes was driven off ‘at speed’ leaving Mr Bhurji dying by the road, the court heard.

He and his female friend both had their phones in the car, and by the time a resident had called an ambulance, it was too late and Mr Bhurji was declared dead at the scene.

The car was fitted with a tracking device and was found later parked neatly near Epping Forest, the court was told. Mr Bhurji’s iPhone was gone.

Prosecutor Sally O’Neill QC said: ‘Mr Bhurji made the mistake of protesting against his car being taken.’

Brutal: Mr Bhurji, a successful garage owner, was parked on this quiet residential road in Ilford, Essex when he was killed as two men allegedly tried to steal his car

Pride: Mr Bhurji refused to hand over the keys to his Mercedes SKL, and was stabbed in the heart and bled to death in the 2011 attack

Denying: Andre Campbell, 23, is accused of selling Mr Bhurji's iPhone for £100

She said the knifeman was defendant Rory Gordon, 23, of east London, working in a ‘joint enterprise’ with his friend Jae’Don Fearon, 21, from Chingford, Essex.

‘It matters not that Fearon was not the one who stabbed Mr Bhurji and was not at the scene - they were in it together and are both guilty of murder.’

CCTV footage and mobile phone data put the pair at the scene of the murder, she said.

Gordon
 drove there in a black Corsa and left in the Mercedes. Fearon then 
picked him up in the Corsa after the stolen car was left to see if it 
would be found by police, the court heard.

The
 prosecutor said Gordon and Fearon decided to carry out the carjacking 
together with ‘the use of a knife and if necessary the actual use of the
 knife to do so’.

She told the jury: ‘If you are sure they were in it together, they will both be guilty of murder.’

Gordon’s friend Andre Campbell, 23, later sold Mr Bhurji’s iPhone for £100, the prosecutor said.

The phone was later recovered by officers investigating the murder.

Gordon and Fearon deny murder.

Campbell of Chingford, Essex, denies a charge of handling stolen goods.

The trial continues.
