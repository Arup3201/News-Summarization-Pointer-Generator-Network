Jonjo Shelvey has been recalled by England despite the fact manager Roy Hodgson knew he had become ‘reticent’ to play for the Under 21 team.

At 22, Shelvey is still eligible for Gareth Southgate’s U21s even though he has not been selected for more than a year, since pulling out of a squad for games against Finland and Moldova in September 2013, a year after winning his only senior cap to date.

‘I believe Gareth spoke to him and he was reticent, maybe, to play in a game or two,’ said Hodgson. ‘As a result Gareth chose other people, as he’s quite entitled to do. If he did turn him down he wouldn’t be the first. I’ve had people turn down first-team national places, which I’ll keep to myself.

Roy Hodgson says Jonjo Shelvey was 'reticent' to play for the Under 21s

‘It may well be that Jonjo, having already played for the first team, might have felt that being asked to play for the Under 21s was stepping back down after, in his eyes, stepping up.’

Hodgson worked with Shelvey at Liverpool and gave the midfielder his full England debut in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October 2012.

He was an unused substitute four days later in Poland, a game which was delayed by a day due to rain in Warsaw. He was then named in a squad for a friendly in Sweden in November 2012, only to withdraw with a thigh injury, and was not named in the senior squad again until Thursday.

In between, Shelvey dropped back into the Under 21 squad, winning his 13th U21 cap in a friendly against Scotland last year when Hodgson was in charge during the void between Stuart Pearce and Southgate.

He played very well against the Scots and it seems was not entirely happy to find he had not been promoted back to the seniors a month later, and left staff with the impression that he felt more experience at U21 level was not going to help his development.

Shelvey insists he never refused to play for England. He has played through the ranks for the U16, U17 and U19 and, on Thursday, spoke of his delight at being back in the senior squad.

‘It’s fantastic to be called up by England at any level, but to be called up to the senior side is a very proud moment for me,’ said Shelvey.

‘A lot of it is down to Garry Monk and the coaching staff here at Swansea with the way they have got us playing. We’ve earned a lot of praise for that. During the last international break there was only about eight of us here training, so it’s a credit to everyone at Swansea for earning international recognition.’

When he initially left Shelvey out last November Southgate, rather unconvincingly, said: ‘I had a feeling he might be with the seniors anyway, so I didn’t want to necessarily pick a player that I didn’t think would be with us for long.’

Gareth Southgate turned to other options after Jonjo Shelvey was selected for the senior squad

After Shelvey’s withdrawal from his squad last year, Southgate quickly turned to other options in midfield and his side won their qualification group in style. 

They will secure a place at next summer’s European U21 Championship in the Czech Republic if they can beat Croatia in a two-legged play-off.

Shelvey has started the new campaign in terrific form for Swansea and was disappointed not to be part of Hodgson’s first squad of the season, when midfielders Fabian Delph and Jack Colback were picked, but Hodgson does not have such a wealth of available players that he can afford to take a stance on a point of principle.

Shelvey was called up for the games against San Marino and Estonia — along with Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne — and Hodgson added: ‘I know his qualities as a player as I worked with him and now it’s a good moment to come into the squad and show me, “This is where I belong”.’

Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw will return to the U21 squad after recently winning their first senior England caps.

Hodgson said: ‘We have made it clear to the players that just because you have been asked into the senior national squad that doesn’t mean you will never play for anyone else. Calum Chambers could play for the U20s.

‘Our players must have the humility to understand they play where we think it is best. We will also take great consideration of their feelings because we don’t intend to ride roughshod over anyone.’
