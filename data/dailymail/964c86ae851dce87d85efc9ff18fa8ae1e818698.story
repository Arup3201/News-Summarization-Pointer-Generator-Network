Debatable: Paul Keating has launched a new tirade on the Monarchy

Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating - dubbed 'the Lizard of Oz' after he once put his arm around the Queen's waist - has sparked new controversy in a new attack on the Monarchy.

He said Australia should get on with the move to a republic and not wait 'till the old lady dies or leaves.'

If Australia hesitated until after the Queen's death, he suggested, 'the next day King Charles and Queen Camilla will be there. And of course they (Australians) will say 'Let's give the new bloke a go.'

His comments have sparked outrage among Monarchists living in Australia, one fan of the Queen describing him as 'a bitter, bitter old man living in the past. His enormous ego and hatred still lives on.'

Mr Keating, who was Prime Minister between 1991 and 1996 - during which he caused outrage when he put hand on the Queen's waist in 1992- hit out at Australia's failure to start the process of becoming a republic during a tv interview.

While acknowledging what he said was the great affection Australians had for the Queen, 'the fact is that Australia can only be a great country when it claims its head of state as one of its own.

'It will for ever have that derivativeness about it while ever our head of state is the Queen of Great Britain and we share her with 16 other countries.

'And by the way, we get around with the British flag in the corner of our flag. Great states to not do these things.'

Mr Keating pointed out that British-born Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd, John Howard and Bob Hawke all believed Australia should not become a republic until the Queen was no longer the Queen.

That said a lot about Australians, he said - fundamentally, what a weak nation they were.

'I mean, we are not going to take our republic, we are going to wait till the old lady dies or leaves.'

He said the royal family would have been quite happy to kiss Australia goodbye.

The Queen, he said, could then visit Australia and receive an even bigger reception as the head of state of Great Britain, not Australia.

'I think the House of Windsor understands that well. It's only the sort of anarchists and dropkicks here who don't get it.'

As for the current Labour government under Miss Gillard, he told Sky that they were 'half-baked republicans.

'They don't have the imagination about this. They don't see the importance to the country.

'The republic will say much more to us about ourselves'

Writers to a newspaper comment page savaged Mr Keating, one pointing out that even the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, is British born and adding 'the only old lady I wish would die is Paul'.

'Here we go again - another Labour has been shooting off his big mouth,' said another writer.

Another said of Mr Keating: 'Absolutely classless. Then again, do we expect anything less?'
