Tory Cabinet ministers warned Liberal Democrat colleagues yesterday that gay marriage and Lords reform cannot be priorities, amid growing signs that senior Coalition partners are flexing their muscles in the wake of poor local election results.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond - increasingly tipped as a future Chancellor - became the most senior member of the Government to suggest plans to allow gay couples to marry should be shelved.

And he echoed David Cameron’s warning last week that the Coalition must not become ‘bogged down’ on House of Lords reform, saying it should only proceed if legislation can go through Parliament relatively easily.

Bigger priorities: Both Philip Hammond and Baroness Warsi have called on the Government to 'prioritise'

Conservative Party chairman Baroness Warsi also said Lords reform was not a priority, saying not one voter had raised the issue on the doorstep with her in the last six months.

Mr Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme that proposals to legalise gay marriage should be delayed to ensure ministers focus on ‘the things that matter’.

He said: ‘Clearly it’s not the number one priority. If you stop people in the street and ask them what their concerns are, they’ll talk to you about jobs and economic growth, they’ll talk to you about the level of the wages they’re earning, wanting to see real growth in wages again.

‘The government has got to show over the next couple of years that it is focused on the things that matter to the people in this country - not just the short-term things but the long-term things as well: the reform of our education system, changing the welfare system - which is like turning around a super-tanker - changing the welfare system so that work always pays and people have an incentive to work.’

Opposed: Tim Loughton, the children's minister, wrote to a constituent to say he was opposed to gay marriage

Mr Hammond’s comments came after Tim 
Loughton, the children’s minister, wrote to a constituent to say he was 
opposed to gay marriage.

‘Marriage as a religious institution cannot be anything other than between a man and a woman.

'I do not see why we need to change the law, especially at this time when there are so many other important matters for the government to be addressing,’ Mr Loughton wrote.

A poll yesterday showed strong support for gay marriage among women, with 53 per cent supporting it and 30 per cent opposed.

The gap is narrower among men, though they still back the idea by 48 per cent to 39 per cent.

The issue divides the generations, however, with over 60s more likely to be opposed.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday gave his backing to gay marriage, urging colleagues not to get themselves ‘hot under the collar’.

‘We’re still out to consultation. It was never intended that we would legislate this year,’ Mr Pickles told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme.

‘It just seems to me to be a question of good manners and if you’ve got something like civil partnership, which are for all practical purposes a marriage, let’s drop the hypocrisy and go all the way.’

Mr Cameron recently said: ‘I ask myself the question, ‘why is it that we deny gay couples the ability to get married?’ And, I don’t think that’s right.

‘Obviously this is a controversial issue. I feel the time for change has come. If you ask, particularly young people, they say this feels like a very natural change to make. We are not changing what happens in church.’

Voters have until next month  to submit their views on the gay marriage proposals, championed by Lib Dem equalities minister Lynne Featherstone and backed by Mr Cameron.
