Sleeping pills: Last week Kerry Kennedy blamed a July 11 car accident on a seizure but now blood tests show she was on the sleeping pill, Ambien

Speaking outside court last week Kerry Kennedy said tests showed she was on no drugs when she smashed her Lexus into a truck and blamed the crash on a ‘partial seizure.’

However, blood tests released today show that RFK's daughter was under the influence of the sleeping drug Ambien on the day of the accident, contradicting her own doctor’s findings.

Prosecutors submitted the report as evidence against 52-year-old Kennedy who pleaded not guilty on July 17 to driving under the influence of drugs.

The blood test, filed in North Castle Town Court, showed that a toxicologist detected 14 nanograms per milliliter of zolpidem, the sleep aid found in Ambien, in a sample taken on July 11, the day Kennedy's Lexus swerved across Interstate 684 and swiped a tractor-trailer.

Responding officers found her slumped over the wheel  of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350

After the crash, she told the officers that she had possibly mixed up two prescription drugs before getting behind the wheel and taken the sleeping pill Ambien instead of a daily prescription that she takes for a thyroid problem.

She then said outside court on the 17th that she was ‘confused and erratic’ while talking to police.

The amount of zolpidem found in her system is low, typical of someone who would have just taken a pill or taken one several hours before, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the sleep disorder center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.

A urine sample was negative for alcohol, the toxicologist wrote.

Speaking outside court last week Kennedy said: 'The accident was not caused by a sleeping aid but by a complex partial seizure. My doctor says this is the first seizure I have ever had.'

In a statement issued late Wednesday Kennedy, the ex-wife of Governor Andrew Cuomo said: 'It now appears that my first instinct was correct.' She said she had sought other explanations for the accident when the first drug tests came back negative.

Family affair: Kerry Kennedy, centre, is flanked by her sister Rory, left and brother Chris right, as she arrived at court on July 17. The Kennedy family have been accused of behaving like an 'organised crime' clan following her arrest

Outraged: The accident and ensuing criticism has led Caroline Kennedy, Kerry's cousin and the daughter of John F.Kennedy, to decry that the family are at their 'lowest point ever,' according to insiders

Police said Kennedy failed several sobriety tests and was swaying and slurring her speech.

After
the crash, the Kennedy family ordered their own ‘battery’ of tests to 
prove that Kerry was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.

The move led a law enforcement source to slam the family as behaving like ‘some organized-crime family’ reported Radar.  'They come out playing hardball with bare knuckles,' the source fumed.

The
accident and ensuing criticism has led Caroline Kennedy, Kerry’s cousin
and the daughter of John F.Kennedy, to decry that the family are at 
their ‘lowest point ever,' according to insiders.

An
insider told the National Enquirer that 54-year-old Caroline Kennedy is
furious with her family and is desperate to save their name for future 
generations.

‘She read Kerry the riot act and is calling the family together to lecture them on cleaning up their act,’ the insider said.

Caroline is reportedly ‘hopping mad’ at her family being likened to a crime family, the insider said.

Kerry Kennedy pleaded not guilty July 17 
to a charge of driving while drug-impaired. She was released but was 
ordered to undergo evaluation by a substance abuse agency. She is due 
back in court Aug. 14, where her lawyers may argue the 'Ambien defense.'

The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively 
new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had 
taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while
intoxicated.

Doctors 
have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and 
even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the 
popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory
of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not 
criminally liable for their actions.

However,
most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where 
the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when 
they were discovered wearing pajamas.

Ambien: Ms Kennedy said she was 'confused and erratic' when she told officers she may have taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'. But on Wednesday she said her 'first instinct' appears to be right after tests showed it WAS in her system the day of the crash

Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York

The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy 
crashed into on July 13 spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's 
daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the 
Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered 
off the interstate.

He told 
the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really 
drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody.'

He
told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop 
down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off 
again, all while veering in and out of lanes.

'When she hit me, my left tire tore up 
her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.'

One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said.

Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really 
drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled 
out of bed.

Political marriage: Ms Kennedy is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left

Family: Kerry with her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and his (now deceased) wife Mary at a gala event in 2006

Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy.

Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign.

She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010.

The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage.

Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

Earlier Wednesday, in Surrogate's Court in White Plains, a dispute over who would handle Mary Kennedy's estate was settled at least temporarily when Conor Kennedy, her son with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., applied for the job.
