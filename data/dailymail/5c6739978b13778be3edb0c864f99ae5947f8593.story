Charles Saatchi booked a suite in the Savoy under a pseudonym and even smuggled a kitten into another hotel as he tried to impress Nigella Lawson while her first husband was dying, it was claimed today.

Mr Saatchi even ordered his chauffeur to buy cat litter during their stay at the Berkeley Hotel so the television cook could look after the kitten while they were together, according to the claims.

The pair would then go on chauffeur-driven shopping trips together to Harvey Nichols and Selfridges.

Team Nigella has fiercely denied claims that she started dating the advertising tycoon before John Diamond died in March 2001.

First husband: Nigella Lawson with John Diamond who died from throat cancer in 2001. Two years later she married Charles Saatchi

However, sources close to Miss Lawson, 53, said that journalist Mr Diamond was well aware that the cook and Mr Saatchi were spending time together. He gave his blessing because he wanted his children to have a father figure.

Former chauffeur John Payne, 67, told The Sun that he booked a hotel for his boss Mr Saatchi and the TV cook under a pseudonym around six months before her husband died.

During the three-night stay, Mr Saatchi took the TV cook to lunch at San Lorenzo restaurant in Knightsbridge, central London, where Princess Diana used to dine.

A typical stay at the Savoy Hotel, The Strand, London, costs just under Â£500 a night with breakfast.

Mr Payne told Wendy Leigh at the newspaper: 'I booked the Savoy Hotel suite where Nigella and Charles spent three days while seeing her in the autumn of 2000, while John Diamond was still alive.

'Charles told me "I'm falling in love with her", and asked me to book the Savoy Hotel suite under one of his pseudonyms, Nightingale or Green.'

When the couple stayed at the Berkeley Hotel the chauffeur was sent to buy Pearls Cat Litter so that Nigella could smuggle in her kitten.

Second husband: Miss Lawson married Charles Saatchi in May 2003. Team Nigella have denied claims from Mr Saatchi that they started dating around six months before her first husband John Diamond died

He later took them on shopping trips in central London to Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.

After the trips, he would drop her off at her home in Shepherds Bush, before driving Mr Saatchi home.

Miss Lawson married Mr Saatchi in his west London home in May 2003 two years after Mr Diamond died.

The couple had their trusted aides Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo acting as witnesses as they tied the knot - a decade before they would accuse them of fraud.

Mr Payne said that he first drove Miss Lawson in 1999 two years before her husband died from cancer.

He picked her up in Mr Saatchi's white Chevrolet Caprice and drove her around while she shopped - before later dropping her off at the home she shared with Mr Diamond in Shepherds Bush, west London.

When she gave evidence in court last month, Miss Lawson said she only 'became involved' with Mr Saatchi after her first husband passed away.

'It would be fair to say that not very long after my first husband died I began to become involved with Mr Saatchi,' she told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court.

However, the 70-year-old millionaire told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'Nigella and I began our relationship 
during the last six months of her husband John Diamond's life, rather 
than after his death as she [Nigella] stated in court.

'Looking back at that time, I very deeply regret that this 
betrayal of John occurred.'

The timing of this 'confession' infuriated Nigella's friends, who described it as a 'wicked attempt to 
smear her'.

Miss Lawson and Mr Diamond had married in Venice in 1992 and they later had two children together before he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997.

Mr Payne said that Mr Diamond came out of the house to have a look at the car.

He added: 'When we got there, Nigella called John and said "Come and look at this car, come and look at it!"

'So he did, we had a chat, and he was very nice, But Charles never asked me to chauffeur him anywhere.'

Mr Saatchi
 and John Diamond had met over gambling games of Scrabble above a restaurant 
in Knightsbridge and eventually the journalist brought Saatchi home to 
meet his wife.

At the time Saatchi was still married to his second wife Kay, mother of his only child Phoebe, 19.

Mr Payne, a grandfather-of-three, said that he was later told to run errands for Miss Lawson - and was often asked to drop gifts for her off at his home.
