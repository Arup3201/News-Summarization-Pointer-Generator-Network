Dozens of primary school children are suspended every year for being drunk or high on drugs, shocking figures reveal.

Once a week during term time an exclusion order is imposed on under-11s for offences including smoking, alcohol abuse or drug dealing.

At secondary school the situation is even worse, with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that parents and teachers are 'losing the battle' against substance abuse.

In 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 was suspended every week during term-time

Figures released in parliament this week show that in 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs.

The Department for Education said it included alcohol abuse, drug dealing, inappropriate use of prescribed drugs, possession of illegal drugs, smoking and substance abuse.

There are 39 weeks in the average school term, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 is suspended every week.

Tory MP Andrew Griffiths, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline: 'The striking thing is that 40 primary school children have been excluded because they turned up drunk or high.

'It is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence. 

'We do have to ask what is happening to the parents of these children and are they being prosecuted. Clearly they are getting the drugs and alcohol from somewhere.'

At secondary schools, 6,500 pupils were temporarily excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that parents and teachers are 'losing the battle' against substance abuse

The figures show that there were 6,590 drink and drug related fixed period suspensions in secondary schools in 2012-13, the latest year for which figures are available.

Another 360 exclusions were imposed, where students were removed from the school permanently, accounting for one in 10 of all expulsions.

The number of secondary school suspensions has fallen from 8,470 in 2009-10, but the number of expulsions has risen since 2010 from 290 to 360. 

Mr Griffths added: 'While it is encouraging that exclusions are down, we continue to fail to prevent young children from taking from the dangers of drugs and alcohol.

'We clearly need to do something urgently to bring those numbers down dramatically.

Mr Griffiths, a patron of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit, added: 'We are continuing to lose the battle.' 

Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT said: 'All too often the issues facing primary schools with regard to pupil behaviour and exclusion are underestimated.

'These figures exemplify the challenges primary teachers are facing.

'The problems for schools are now being exacerbated by the cuts to local authority funding which have resulted in specialist provision on which schools have relied being reduced or removed.

'Early intervention is essential to prevent these children being lost to the education service.'

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Prohibited items including alcohol and drugs have no place whatsoever in the classroom. We have introduced a range of powers for teachers to ensure discipline, behaviour and safety are maintained.

'Our guidance on behaviour, clarifies what headteachers can do to properly discipline disruptive pupils and frees up teachers' time and energy, allowing them to focus on what they do best – teaching and inspiring our next generation.

'Teachers now have stronger powers to search pupils, when they suspect they may be in possession of a prohibited item. Changes to the system mean a school's decision to exclude a pupil can no longer be overruled. Teachers can use reasonable force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom when necessary.'
