The team behind the world's solar powered plane that can fly by night are planning their most ambitious adventure yet - to circumnavigate the globe in 20 days and nights without a drop of fuel.

The Solar Impulse currently holds the record for the longest flight by a manned solar-powered plane, staying in the skies 30,000 ft above Switzerland for more than 26 hours.

Created by Swiss adventurers Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, it flies using four propeller engines powered by 12,000 solar cells attached to vast wings.

Record breaker: The Solar Impulse currently holds the record for the longest flight by a manned solar-powered plane, staying in the skies 30,000 ft above Switzerland for more than 26 hours

It is not the first plane to be powered solely by the light of the sun, but it is the first to be able to continue its flight even after night has fallen - all the way until the dawn.

It collects so much energy from the sun during the day that it can store electricity to power it through the night.

Earlier this year it completed a 1,550-mile voyage across Europe to North Africa in three steps, but its creators believe its radical design could allow it to fly forever.

High tech: Made from lightweight materials, the Solar Impulse has a wingspan to match a jumbo yet weighs only as much as a small car

For the solar cells which power the the engines of Solar Impulse are not just attached to its wings - they are its wings. Mr Piccard told CBS News how the solar cell wings convert light directly to electricity.

'And then this electricity goes simultaneously to the engines and to the batteries and then we will reach the next sunrise and capture the sun again,' he said. 'And we can continue theoretically forever.'

Constructed from lightweight materials, the Solar Impulse has a wingspan to match a jumbo jet yet weighs only as much as a small car.

The plane's wings are covered with solar panels housing thousands of cells designed to collect the energy of the sun's rays and power four electric motors driving wing-mounted propellers.

Mr Piccard could be said to have adventure in the blood. His grandfather Auguste set an altitude record, and is perhaps the first person to have seen the curvature of the Earth.

His father Jacques went the other way, plunging in a bathyscape to the bottom of Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the deepest location of the Earth's crust.

'That was really impressive for me as a kid because I was reading in the history books all the stories about the Earth being flat, being round or whatever,' he told CBS.

'And my grandfather came back and said, "I saw the curvature of the Earth with my eyes." So once you live this as a kid, of course, you want to continue into that field of exploration.'

And Piccard clan's latest adventurer has not been slow off the mark, already winning the first trans-Atlantic balloon race and becoming the first person to complete a nonstop balloon flight around the globe.

It was after nearly running out of fuel and crash landing in the Egyptian desert on that latter escapade Mr Piccard dreamed up the idea of circling the globe in an aircraft that needed no fuel.

'It was almost a failure due to the dependency on fuel and on that day I made a promise,' he said. 'I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world it would be with no fuel at all.'

Although the goal is to show that emissions-free air travel is possible, the team has said it does not see solar technology replacing conventional jet-powered planes any time soon.

Instead, the project is designed to test and promote new energy-efficient technologies.

Mr Piccard and Mr Borschberg hope to test the latest design of their aircraft with a flight from California to Virginia next year, before embarking on their epic round the world trip in 2015.
