A 71-year-old farmer has been charged with murdering his churchwarden wife after she was found strangled at home in a remote country village.

Peter Thurgarland is accused of killing his wife Julia, 70, at their farmhouse home in the village of Maplebeck, Nottinghamshire, on December 28.

Mr Thurgarland, who was also found at the country home with 'life-threatening injuries' is due to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today.

He was arrested in hospital on Saturday but police have not revealed the nature of his injuries or how they were incurred.

Discovered: Mrs Thurgaland was found dead at her home, in Maplebeck, on Friday

Residents have spoken of how the 
murder had shaken their community to its core. Mrs Thurgarland was a churchwarden at
nearby St Radegunds Church in the village which has a population of just 96.

Neighbours said she and her husband, who had been married for 46 years, had farmed in the village for decades before retiring.

Retired vicar Eddie Neale said: 
‘There is an enormous sense of shock, obviously, in the whole village 
and in the wider community that such a thing could happen here.

‘They were much-loved people. He had 
been one of the local farmers here and looked after quite a large area. 
She had been involved in all sorts of organisations around the place.’

The couple's three adult children, David, 41, Ann, 39, and Jane, 37, were being supported by police while prayers were said at the local church.

Prayers were yesterday being said at a
service at the local church. The Reverend Richard Seymour-Whiteley 
said: ‘Our prayers are with them all [the family], along with all those 
who knew Julia well.’

One villager, who did not want to be 
named, said: ‘We are a very  small and tight-knit community. Mrs 
Thurgarland was well known and very popular.’

Cordon: Police have today continued investigations at the house where Mrs Thurgaland and the injured man were found

Inquiries: Police carrying out the investigation are continuing to appeal for information into the incident

Pillar of the community: Mrs Thurgaland was a churchwarden at St Radegunds Church, in Maplebeck

Another villager added: 
‘The whole village is in shock, it’s just tragic. It’s such a small 
community, everyone knows everyone.’

Maplebeck is situated in the  
mid-Nottinghamshire countryside, near the ancient minster town of 
Southwell. A post-mortem examination found that Mrs Thurgarland had been
strangled.

Commenting on the inquiry, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The inquiries undertaken throughout yesterday make me quite certain this is an isolated incident and we will interview the suspect as soon as possible to determine the circumstances leading up to Mrs Thurgarland’s death.'

Speaking on Sunday, the Rev Richard Seymour-Whiteley, the priest-in-charge of a cluster of churches which includes St Radegund, said: 'There has been a tragic incident in Maplebeck in which our churchwarden at Maplebeck, Mrs Julia Thurgarland, has died and her husband is in hospital.

'We wish to respect the family’s privacy at this time and our prayers are with them all, along with all those who knew Julia well.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
