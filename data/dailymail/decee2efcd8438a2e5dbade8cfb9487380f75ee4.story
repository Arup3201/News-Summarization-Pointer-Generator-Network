Mexico were dramatically knocked out of the World Cup having led Holland until the 88th minute through Giovani dos Santos's 48th-minute strike.

But Wesley Sneijder's timely finish and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's perfectly put away penalty in injury time saw Louis van Gaal's side through to the quarter finals.

Victorious: Holland substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (left) celebrates scoring the winner from the spot

SAMI MOKBEL rates the individual players' performances:

HOLLAND

Jasper Cillessen - 6

Some nervy moments, not the most commanding presence for the Dutch.

Ron Vlaar - 5

Had major problems dealing with Mexico's midfield runners all afternoon.

Stefan de Vrij - 6

Struggled in the sweltering conditions. Looks decent with his feet, though. 

Body behind the ball: Holland keeper Jasper Cillessen makes a save against Mexico

Daley Blind - 6.5

Showed his versatility by starting at centre-back before moving to midfield.

Paul Verhaegh - 5

Couldn't contain Layun down Mexico's left. Replaced early in second half.

Dirk Kuyt - 6

Playing in an unorthodox left wing-back position. As always a willing worker.

For the team: Dirk Kuyt (right) played out of position ad battled through the heat for Louis van Gaal

Nigel De Jong - 5

Only last nine minutes before coming off injured. His departure unsettled Holland.

Wesley Sneijder - 6.5

Largely anonymous all game and then bang. Game-saving goal.

Georgino Wijnaldium - 6

Kept things ticking over in midfield but struggled to contain Mexico.

Under-firing: Manchester United striker Robin van Persie was substituted in the second half

Arjen Robben - 6.5

Mexico kept him quiet, but a moment of brilliance won the decisive penalty.

Robin van Persie - 5.5

Was starved of service, having little impact before his substitution.

Right time and place: Wesley Sneijder (right) made no mistake when he smashed home the equaliser

SUBS

Martins Indi (for De Jong, 46) - 5.5

Slotted into at centre-back after his early introduction.

Depay (for Verhaegh, 56) - 5.5

Couldn't galvanise his side the way he'd have liked.

Huntelaar (for Van Persie, 76) - 6

Showed guts with his penalty.

Subs not used: Vorm, Janmaat, de Guzman, Veltman, Kongolo, Clasie, Lens, Fer, Krul.

COACH

Louis van Gaal - 7

Call him lucky but his side found the answers again.

Mexico

Guillermo Ochoa - 8

What a display, a performance of a lifetime - but still a loser.

Francisco Rodgriguez - 7.5

Colossal at the heart of his side's defence. Strong in the air.

Rafa Marquez - 6

Looked good all afternoon before his late moment of madness.

Man of the match: Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa (left) tops our player ratings in a losing side

Hector Moreno - 6.5

Helped keep Van Persie and Robben at bay before being replaced.

Paul Aguilar - 7

Huge energy down Mexico's right. Caused Kuyt some problems.

Miguel Layun - 6.5

A thorn in Holland's side down the left. Final ball could have been better, though.

Big loss: Hector Moreno limped off in pain in the first half

Carlos Salcido - 6.5

The former Fulham man looked comfortable in a holding midfield role.

Andres Guardado - 7

A very tidy display from the midfielder. Kept things ticking over nicely.

Hector Herrera - 7

An absolute menace. Was given license to roam in Mexico's attacking quarter.

Trouble: Mexico midfielder Hector Herrera (right) gets around Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder

Giovani Dos Santos - 7

The former Spurs man drifted in and out of the game but scored a great goal.

Oribe Peralta - 6.5

His movement caused Holland problems. Didn't give defenders a second's peace.

SUBS

Diego Reyes (for Moreno, 46) - 6

Kept Holland at bay before disaster struck.

Javier Aquino (for Dos Santos, 61) - 6

Brought on to help combat late Dutch onslaught.

Javier Hernandez (Peralta for, 75) - 6

Came on to hurry Dutch defenders. 

Belter: Giovani dos Santos scored the opener from long range for Mexico

Subs not used: Corona, Fabian, Jimenez, Pulido, Ponce, Brizuela, Pena, Talavera.

COACH: Miguel Herrera - 7.5

His side were a credit to him. Will be heartbroken after Mexico's late collapse.

REFEREE: Pedro Proenca - 6.5
