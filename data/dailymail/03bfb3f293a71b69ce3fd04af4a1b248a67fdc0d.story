Former Disney pop princess Miley Cyrus caused an uproar when she took to the stage at this year's Video Music Awards wearing a flesh-coloured latex bikini and performing a seriously overtly sexual dance routine.

The 20-year-old's bottom shaking and grinding may not have won her many accolades in the music community, but a few savvy fitness fanatics realised that ‘twerking’ is a great way to tone up and burn calories.

The ‘twerking’ dance, which has even been honored with an official entry in the Oxford Dictionaries Online, essentially involves adopting a traditional gym squat position and maintaining it while vigorously shaking the derriere.

Miley's risque VMA performance shocked many and made her the subject of much discussion last weekend

Whatever your thoughts on Miley's raunchy VMAs performance, there can be no doubt that her body is toned and lean

This dynamic combination of toning positions and cardio combined with Miley's enviable physique led to women becoming eager to try the ‘twerk’ for themselves.

Les Mills, creator of fitness programmes including Bodypump, says it received a number of requests for a class featuring twerking moves following Miss Cyrus's controversial VMA performance.

They adapted their existing Bodyjam class to incorporate a number of energetic twerking moves - to great effect.

They have seen a surge of interest in the dance class and are considering changing the class's name to the Twerkout.

Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes

To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward

To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone

The new version developed by Les Mills incorporates the signature twerking steps including the 'shake', 'wobble' and 'jiggle'.

While Robin Thicke won't be available for fitness fanatics to twerk against, the dance routines are choreographed to the latest chart hits… and instructors are fully trained to dodge amorous advances.

In addition to burning 530 calories per 55 minute session, research by Les Mills also reveals twerkers could see on average an eight per cent increase in pelvic bone density with regular participation.

Bone density is essential to avoiding osteoporosis in later life, meaning that twerking could help you avoid fractures or hip replacements in later life.

Gandalf Archer, Les Mills International Programme Developer comments on the craze and development of the Bodyjam programme, saying:

'We can't wait to get more people twerking their way to a better body.'

Bodyjam Twerkout in action: The bootyshake is a key exercise for any aspiring twerker

Dave Kyle, Head Trainer for Les Mills, offers his top five tips to get your rear in gear Bodyjam style:

1. Warm up with hip rolls, rotating your hips up, down, left and right, so your joints are suitably loosened for you to get your twerk on

2. Squats and pulses (a 'bounce' mid repetition) are ideal to get your back end looking great.

3. The bootyshake is a key exercise for any aspiring twerker. Integral to the Bodyjam workout the aim is to shake your rear whilst keeping the rest of your body still – really working those glutes

4. A signature move for Bodyjam, the 'tick tock' is an essential heel-toe grind to work up quads to rival Rihanna

5. DON'T stick your tongue out. It didn't work for Miley and it won't work for you!

Instead stick your bottom out at everyone opportunity, this pose will build your core to guarantee a whittled waist to set off your behind.
