Louis Van Gaal said this week it could take £60million man Angel di Maria a year to adapt to life at Old Trafford - but it took the United boss 59 minutes to decide he had seen enough at St James' Park.

Another unconvincing display was brought prematurely to an end moments after Di Maria flopped a hopeless right-wing cross into a visitors' box bereft of team-mates.

But it could have been a different story if Di Maria - hauled off at half-time in Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland - had made his mark inside the opening minute.

The Argentinian was sent clean through after a mistake by home defender Mehdi Abeid - but he inexplicably hesitated with the goal at his mercy and the chance was lost.

It was destined to be Di Maria's best chance of making an impression. He was afforded plenty of space on the right flank but worked in fits and starts and was well marshalled by home pair Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi.

When he was too easily robbed in his own half one minute before the interval it sparked a charge upfield from Moussa Sissoko which ended in a clear-cut chance for Emmanuel Riviere in the visitors' box.

Di Maria did offer the occasional hint of quality in the second period, not least in the 54th minute when he provided the cross from which Marouane Fellaini then Ashley Young brought fine saves out of Tim Krul.

But all too often the fickers were extinguished by those lackadaisical losses of possession of inexplicable passes into empty space.

And shortly after one wasted opportunity too many, Di Maria was substituted again with the home fans' chants of 'what a waste of money' ringing in his ears.
