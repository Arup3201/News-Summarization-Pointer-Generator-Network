Fashion designer Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss has split from her husband of ten years, music label executive Joshua Gruss. 

The 39-year-old New Yorker and her soon-to-be ex-husband confirmed the news to Page Six earlier today, adding that the separation is 'amicable and sad' and revealing that they will continue to raise their three children together. 

Ms Lonstein, who founded her eponymous fashion label in 1998, married Joshua, 39, in a lavish ceremony at the Metropolitan Club on May 10, 2003.

The couple welcomed their first daughter Sienna in 2005 and twins Angelica and Joseph in 2012. 

Ms Lonstein, who has collaborated with a number of big name fashion, including Club Monaco and QVC since launching her own clothing line, first rose to fame after enjoying a four-year relationship with TV star Jerry Seinfeld.

Mr Seinfeld, who is 21 years older than Ms Lonstein, first met his then-girlfriend while she was still a student at the prestigious Nightingale-Bamford School for Girls in Manhattan. 

Eager to be closer to the sitcom star, who was, at the time, still filming his hit series in Los Angeles, Ms Lonstein transferred to UCLA, where she completed a double bachelors degree in history and art history.

The four-year relationship came to and end in 1997, with the budding designer blaming the split on the constant press attention focused on the pair, coupled with her desire to return to New York in order to start her fashion line.

Since her return to New York 17 years ago, Ms Lonstein has continued to attract the attention of the media, not least because of her blunt attitude towards the fashion industry and its intolerance of more curvaceous women.

'My whole life, starting as a young teen, I was a hard fit for clothes,” she told the New York Observer earlier this year. 

'I was incredibly voluptuous, and it was frustrating as a young woman to not find things that fit well and made me feel celebratory of my body. I’m fortunate that I had a mom who helped me find those things or altered them, especially my swimsuits. 

'I was a size 2, but then I had a very busty top, and it could be very damaging for young girls to not feel like they can find things that work for them.'

Happy families: Mr Seinfeld went on to marry former Tommy Hilfiger PR Jessica in December 1999. The couple are pictured together at the opening night of Broadway's The River yesterday evening

Following her marriage to Joshua, who is the son of financier Martin Gruss and CEO of Round Hill Music,she has continued to see her business thrive and last year was named as the first ever Style Director of high-end brand Elizabeth Arden.

Mr Seinfeld, now 60, married his wife Jessica, a former PR for fashion label Tommy Hilfiger, in 1999, after first meeting her in August 1998 at the Reebok Sports Club in New York. 

The couple have three children together - one daughter, Sascha, 14, and two sons, Julian, 11, and Shepherd, 9.
