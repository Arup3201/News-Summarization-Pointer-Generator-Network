When it comes to holiday making, us Britons like nothing more good old-fashioned reliability. And cruise holidays are the most hassle-free form of break, according to a study.

Climbing aboard a cruise ship pipped both city breaks and beach holidays to the post, when it came to the most popular type of holiday, with Britons saying they had the friendliest staff, there are fewer delays and the facilities are much cleaner than on other holidays.

Stress-free: Almost a third of Britons polled said they were planning a cruise for their next holiday

The study asked participants the type of holiday they had been on in the past three years that they found to be the most reliable in terms of all-round planning and enjoyment, involving the least hassle.

Cruise holidays were seen as having the cleanest facilities, less delays, friendlier and more engaging staff, better entertainment and no cancellations.

And of those polled, almost a third, (31 per cent) stated that they had either already booked a cruise, or were planning one for their next holiday, in order to cut out the unnecessary stress and planning of alternative trips.

When asked what they perceived to be the most reliable types of holiday, 52 per cent of participants said cruise holidays, 23 per cent said city breaks, 11 per cent said beach holidays and 8 per cent said skiing holidays.

The research polled a total of 1,438 adults aged 18 and over, who had all been on both a cruise holiday as well as other types of holidays within the past three years.

The research was conducted by an independent online cruising agency bonvoyage.co.uk.
