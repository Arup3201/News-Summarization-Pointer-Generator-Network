A family was left distraught after their five-month-old Labrador ate their £400 holiday money the day before they set off.

Murphy has a habit of eating everything he can find from socks to skirting boards.

So when mother-of-two Donnah Dear left cash for a four-day holiday to Torremolinos on the kitchen counter, he couldn't resist.

Shock: Donnah Dear, 37, and her sons Oliver, three, and Toby, six, with Murphy who ate £400 of their cash

It wasn't until she and partner Ben Lawson, 36, came home to pack that they discovered what had happened.

Ms Dear, 37, said: 'It just disappeared. There wasn't a trace of it, not a corner of a note or anything.

'We spent ages looking before we realised Murphy must have eaten it.'

Determined to go on the holiday with their sons Toby, six, and Oliver, three, they left the puppy at home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, with Mr Lawson's mother Jill.

Incredibly, by the time they returned £375 of the cash had emerged intact - and Barclays agreed to put the chewed-up cash back in their account.

Despite emergency surgery since, to recover an eaten sock, the remaining £25 has not been found.

The family had been planning to spend the money they saved during a four-day trip to Torremolinos

Ms Dear added: 'We thought 'oh no we are going on holiday with no money, that's really bad' - but it was okay, it didn't ruin our trip.

'We managed to get enough money together so it was alright.

'As we queued to get on the plane we heard that Jill had got about £300 back, by the time we returned it was £375.

'The last £25 has disappeared.

'We took the money to Barclays and although the notes had been chewed up and stuck back together they put the money in our account, which was really good of them.'

Despite recovering the money, Ms Dear, who runs an estate agents with Mr Lawson, said: 'Murphy will be our first and last dog.

'He honestly eats everything and we aren't actually sure what to do about it.'
