A Chicago man has caught on video what could be the worst effect yet of the polar vortex: A burst pipe raining a storm of human waste through the ceiling of his advertising agency office.

Kasey Moore, an advertising art director for Arc Worldwide, posted the stomach churning scene from the 15th floor of the Leo Burnett skyscraper Tuesday afternoon and the content is not suited for the faint of heart.

It shows a sea of brown water filling up the office floor as more continues to gush down in a torrent onto the sprawling room’s desks and cubicles as horrified workers scramble to get out of the way.

It's raining, it's pouring: As if the polar vortex couldn't get any worse, a burst pipe in a Chicago skyscraper caused a sewage storm to rain down on the Arc Worldwide ad agency

‘So, this is happening on my floor at work,’ writes Moore on Instagram. ‘Poo eruption.’

It remained unclear from the video how widespread the leak was, but at over a million square feet, the 50-story tower can undoubtedly contain enough sewage to rain on a lot of employees’ parades.

A spokesperson for the building officially denied that the brown liquid described by some as 'smelly' actually contained feces.

'While we appreciate the creativity, rest assured that it's only dust and water,' the spokesperson told Business Insider via e-mail.

Moore’s appears to be the most vivid post yet of the ‘poo eruption,’ but some of his office mates have taken to social media to document the destruction as well.

Instagram user bobbi12781 posted a 
photo of a distraught man fleeing a cascade of human waste, but gave an 
understated description of the putrid scene.

‘It's water from a busted pipe,’ she wrote. ‘Smelly water.’

Adrift in it: Kasey Moore of ad agency Arc Worldwide posted a video that makes all too clear the extent of the sewage leak on the 15th floor of the 50-story Leo Burnett building

‘What better way to start off the new year,’ complained jenibreni beside her own photo of the leak.

While the exact cause of the leak remained unclear Tuesday evening, hospitals in Boston, Washington, DC, and Cleveland have all reported pipe bursts caused by the freezing Polar Vortex temperatures.

These unfortunate Chicagoans have not only experienced a sewage storm this week, but they’ve also had to endure some of the worst winter chills the historic polar vortex has to offer.

Temperatures in the Windy City hit -15 degrees Monday evening and hovered around 10 degrees at their highest on Tuesday.

While the situation appears dire for the ad men and women of Arc Worldwide, commenter blipsman suggests on Moore’s video post that there could be a silver lining in all that sewage:

‘Viral campaign for Bounty?’
