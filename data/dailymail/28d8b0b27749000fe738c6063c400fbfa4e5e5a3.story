'Brilliant': Captain Stephen Healey was praised for his leadership and bravery

An Army officer commended for his bravery after twice cheating death while fighting in Afghanistan has been killed by a Taliban roadside bomb.

Captain Stephen Healey, 29, of the 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, was on patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj region of Helmand Province on Saturday when his armoured vehicle was blown up by an improvised explosive device.

The former Swansea City footballer – described by commanders as a ‘brilliant officer and a truly outstanding individual’ – had received a Mention in Despatches for valour during his first tour of duty in the warzone in 2009-10.

He was honoured for ‘outstanding leadership’ after selflessly drawing insurgents’ gunfire three times to save his comrades during an ambush.

It meant men in his unit pinned down by the Taliban could return accurate fire.

Captain Healey, of Cardiff, also escaped unharmed after his vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in 2009.

Last night his father John, mother Kerry, brother Simon and girlfriend Thea paid tribute in a statement.

They said: ‘Stephen was all you could wish for in a son, brother, uncle and friend. He will be sadly missed by us all. He managed to do more in his 30 years than most people do in a lifetime.’

The former centre-back was a Swansea City apprentice for two years before signing a two-year contract.

But after a succession of injuries he quit the game in 2001, going on to Swansea University, where he did a sports science degree, and then the Army.

Captain Healey was commanding a reconnaissance platoon when his vehicle was struck.

He was given first aid before being flown to the military hospital at Camp Bastion, the British HQ in Helmand, where his death was confirmed.

The number of British service personnel killed in Afghanistan is now 415.

Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Webb, the commanding officer of 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, said Captain Healey would be remembered ‘as one of the most charismatic and professional leaders any of us will have had the privilege of serving with’.
