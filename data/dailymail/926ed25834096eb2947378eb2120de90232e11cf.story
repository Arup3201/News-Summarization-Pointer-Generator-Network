Argentina could mount a protest about the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands at the Olympics, the government fears.

Intelligence has been received by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) that suggests Argentina could attempt to use the event to attract worldwide attention.

There are concerns that the 140 Argentine athletes taking part in the London 2012 games this summer may use the Las Malvinas flag on their kit - the Argentine name for the islands.

Jesse Owens made his Black Power protest in Berlin on the track.

Tommie Smith and John Carlos made theirs on the podium, with civil rights badges on their tracksuits, one black-gloved fist raised in salute, heads bowed, barefooted.

The two Americans did it after Smith set a world record for the 200m, ahead of Australian Peter Norman and Carlos.

The fists symbolised black unity and the bare feet black poverty, they explained.

The International Olympic Committee threatened to suspend the entire US team unless the USOC expelled the two from the Games Village, which they did

If they were to stage a poltical protest it would mirror one staged by African-American athletes at the men’s 200m medal ceremony at the 1968 Games in Mexico City.

There have also been claims hooligans plan to travel to London to demonstrate at one of the Games venues with a national flag bearing an image of the Falklands.

Diplomatic relations between the two countries are already strained.

Last week when David Cameron was involved in an 
extraordinary stand-up row with Argentina’s president Cristina Fernandez
 de Kirchner yesterday over the future of the Falkand Islands.

Tension: Ms Kirchner attempted to hand Mr Cameron a package last June marked 'UN - Malvinas' but the Prime Minister refused to accept it

The South American leader appeared to
 attempt to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country’s 
claim to the British territory into Mr Cameron’s hands at the G20 summit
 in Mexico.

To her fury, the Prime Minister 
refused to accept it – and insisted that she respect the views of the 
islanders, who want to remain British.

A
 senior FCO source told the Sunday Times: 'We are concerned that 
Argentina will use the Olympics as an opportunity for protests about the
 Falklands and have been looking into what we can do.

'They seem determined to push their case at every opportunity.'

Argentina’s national Olympic committee has insisted it does not see the Games as a 'platform for politics' and assured the IOC its team would not cause trouble.

The FCO source said to the newspaper: 'The athletes will not be able to wear Malvinas T-shirts, but we can’t stop everything, particularly what goes on outside the stadium.'

Earlier this year Argentine president Cristina Kirchner was left red-faced after it emerged the star of her controversial Falklands ad is set to miss the Olympics.

Opening scene: Argentina sparked outrage with its Falklands video

Hockey player Fernando Zylberberg flew to the islands and worked out on a British war memorial ahead of the London games with the boast : 'To compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil.'

The Argentine government ignored international criticism to screen the ad repeatedly and use it to launch vitriolic attacks on Britain.

But their outspoken president was put on the back foot after it emerged Zylberberg has been left out of a pre-Olympics hockey tournament and will almost certainly be passed over for London.
