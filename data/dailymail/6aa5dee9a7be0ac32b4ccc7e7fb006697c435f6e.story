Glum rocker: Daz Bishop, 52, was booted from a Slade homecoming gig for 'dancing like a ****'

A Slade superfan who paid £61 to see the glam rockers was thrown out of their Christmas gig - for his dancing.

The 70s legends were two songs into their homecoming set at Birmingham Town Hall when a staff member told Daz Bishop, 52, to 'stop dancing like a ****'.

The building firm manager was thrown out after a heated dispute and is now considering legal action against the venue.

Chiefs refused Mr Bishop's requests for a refund, saying he had blocked fans' view and caused a safety risk.

They also accused him of getting aggressive when he was challenged over his moves and claimed he left of his own accord.

Mr Bishop, from Penkridge, Staffordshire, said: 'I've followed them all around the world and it's the first time I've been kicked out of a concert for dancing.

'It's not as if I was the only one.

'I wasn't drunk, I had two pints.

'I wasn't causing trouble, I wasn't aggressive and there were loads of people dancing and taking pictures.

'Nothing was said to them.

'I'm furious. I've told them I'll contact my MP and go legal.'

Slade, most famous for their song 
Merry Xmas Everybody, starred at the town hall last week alongside
 spandex-clad 70s rockers Sweet.

A statement from the Town Hall said Mr Bishop blocked other customers by 'waving his arms' and he left of his own accord after a lengthy discussion with bosses.

A letter to him read: 'In the course of this discussion I understand our security officer made contact in restraining you from re-entering the auditorium.

'I apologise if you took offence to 
this but can assure you the officer is an SIA accredited door supervisor
 and has been trained to take specific action in certain circumstances.

'It
 is the view of the duty manager you and a member of the party were both
 aggressive and abusive to both herself and other members of her team.'

Moves: Daz Bishop re-enacts his dancing. He insisted he was not the only one and has threatened legal action

Mr Bishop denied the claims, saying he started dancing at the back of the hall before moving towards the stage to take pictures.

He added: 'I asked to speak to a manager, someone told me we couldn't dance due to health and safety.

'I have never heard anything so stupid. We've been to loads of Sweet and Slade gigs and that's what you do - dance.

'You go to these gigs to have fun, enjoy yourself and dance.

'I've followed Slade for 40 years and never been treated this badly.'

It is not known whether Slade frontman Noddy Holder (left in 1975) would have approved of Daz Bishop's moves

Town Hall chief executive Andrew 
Jowatt said: 'I am aware of the complaint and have complete confidence 
staff on the night dealt with this manner in the most appropriate way.

'We have a duty of care to ensure everyone who attends concerts at Town Hall and Symphony Hall enjoy themselves.

'It
 was felt on this occasion Mr Bishop's presence at the front of the 
stage, blocking the view of other audience members, was inappropriate, 
thus leading to our request for him to move back to his seat.'
