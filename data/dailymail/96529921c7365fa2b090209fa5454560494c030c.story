A cat that suffered serious burns and 'acute stress' when her twisted owner microwaved her in retaliation for scratching him has been re-homed.

When RSPCA inspectors found the black and white cat, named Nancy, she felt hot to the touch, her head was hanging low and she was breathing heavily.

She was rushed to the Stubbington Ark rescue centre, near Fareham, Hampshire, after being placed in the cooker for five seconds.

Cruel: Pet cat Nancy suffered serious burns and 'acute stress' when her former owner microwaved her in retaliation for scratching him

However, Nancy has now been nursed back to health by new owners Taff Jones, 64, and his wife Pam, 41, from Southsea.

The couple adopted Nancy after Mrs Jones said she wanted a cat for her 40th birthday.

Mrs
 Jones originally picked a three-legged cat because she wanted to give a
 home to a cat she thought had no other chance of adoption.

However, by the time her husband visited the Ark, the three-legged cat had been adopted - and he then spotted Nancy.

He
 said: 'I was looking a the cubicles and this little face was looking 
out at me. She adopted me, rather than the other way around.

'I
 thought she was beautiful and I knew I had to adopt her. When I put a 
reserve on her in the reception, the whole place fell quiet.

'They told me her story and I had to sit down as I felt physically ill. To think someone could do that.

'They said "Do you still want her?", and I said "Of course!".'

Mr Jones now made Nancy the star of a children's book, named Tales Of Nancy Jones and featuring three stories about Nancy's life.

'They are tales of friendship and kindness, which is how Nancy lives her life,' said Mr Jones.

'Children reading these tales will grow up to be good people.'

The couple will donate a percentage of their profits from the sale of the book to the Ark, as a way of saying thank you for saving Nancy.

It will go towards the centre's Paws4Help appeal, which hopes to raise 250,000 pounds for a new cattery.

Mr Jones added: 'The Ark saved her life. She was with them for nine months while the vets got her right.

'They are still not sure if there is any lasting damage, but she's very affectionate and she is part of our family.'

Mr Jones hopes to print volume two of Tales Of Nancy Jones soon, and is already working on the plot for volume three.

The book also features photographs and drawings of Nancy. It is being sold on Amazon for Â£7.95, and is also available from the Ark.

The previous owner was banned from keeping animals for life and given a 16 week suspended prison sentence for causing unnecessary suffering.

He denied the charge but was convicted at trial in 2011.

The sentencing magistrate said at the time: 'It was a deliberate act to seriously injure the animal, causing a high level of stress and unnecessary suffering against a defenceless animal.'
