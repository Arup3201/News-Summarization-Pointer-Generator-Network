Lisa Faulkner is a sensitive soul. When the sun's shining she's happy as a dog with two tails, but when it's raining... well, let's just say, the world is not her favourite place. 'I suppose my life is dictated by my moods,' she says.

'When it's raining and it's a Sunday and it's horrible, there's that feeling of, "Oh God". I'm not good at pulling myself out of it. I have to wallow in it so I hide in my kitchen and cook. If I feel something, I feel it 100 per cent. If I feel sad, I feel really sad. If I'm happy I bounce about.'

Thankfully, actress-turned-cookery expert Lisa, 41, is in a bouncy mood when we meet. I guess her 'really new, really lovely' relationship with BBC1's MasterChef judge John Torode has something to do with it. They've been seeing one another since last October, two-and-a-half years after Lisa won the 2010 series of Celebrity Master-Chef and began working in John's posh London restaurant Smiths of Smithfield (which he's since sold).

Happier now: Lisa has come through IVF and a failed relationship

'When I met John he was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down. All I could think was, “That sauce hasn't worked.” I didn't see anything but food for three months. After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.'

Quite rightly too, for they were both married with young children. John, 48, separated from Jessica, his wife of four years and the mother of his eight-year-old son and six-year-old daughter, at the end of 2011. Lisa's marriage to actor Chris Coghill, with whom she has an adopted daughter Billie, seven, ended in April last year. Which leads me to the tricky bit...

Look Lisa, you're a lovely girl (she is) and a joy to meet (ditto), but we know how steamed up kitchens can be. Are you honestly saying this really-new-really-lovely relationship wasn't simmering away before your respective marriages ended? 'Absolutely not,' she says. 'It never crossed my mind. John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...'

Until? 'I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different.' Slightly? 'I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.' Including her daughter Billie? She nods.

'John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...'

Billie was 15 months old when she was adopted after Lisa had endured three failed IVF attempts.

'The other day Billie was bouncing on the trampoline with a friend and I heard the friend say something about, “When you were born was your mummy really big?” Billie said, “My Tummy Mummy had me. My mummy adopted me so she's my Forever Mummy. I didn't grow in her tummy. I grew in her heart.”' Lisa has tears in her eyes as she tells me this. 'Both Chris and I really wanted to be parents. Going for adoption is very, very tough, but I didn't want to get to 40-something thinking, “I've spent everything on IVF. I can't do anything else and I'm past the time I can adopt.” I thought, “I want to be a mother and, whatever it takes, I will be a mother.”

'Chris was completely on the same page from day one. There are a lot of reasons you separate. It's rarely just one thing. I suppose the IVF was a huge strain. You go crazy. There are so many drugs flying around your body and you're on this mission to get pregnant. You spend so much money. It's fraught. You're injecting yourself in the loos and you've got bruises all over you. Mentally there's all those highs and then loss. It's heartbreaking. Most people have a child at the end of it, so think, “I've got this, which makes it worth it.” For a long time I didn't have anything to make it better. Nothing.'

She sighs. 'After adopting I was at home for a year. It was very strange going back into that world of telly.'

Lisa began acting at 19 in the film The Lover after leaving school at 16 to model. Roles in Brookside, Holby City and Spooks followed. 'For a year you're defined by talking about babies then you go back into the real world and think, “Who am I? I don't know who I am.”

'We worked very hard to make our marriage work and it didn't. But we have a friendship that works with Billie and that's everything to us. It's not her fault we couldn't make it work. My daughter is my number one priority.'

New romance: Lisa Faulkner with John Torode

We're here because Lisa has written her second recipe book, The Way I Cook…, which features Billie throughout. 'Cooking anchors me and calms me,' she says. 'Whenever life throws its curve balls I gravitate towards the kitchen, but I never knew I was any good at cooking. When I won MasterChef, I found I was good at something I loved. Cooking for me is about moods. I find I want to cook different things at different times.'

The Way I Cook… includes recipes for 'when the sun is shining', 'on a rainy day', 'for family and friends' and features a recipe for John Torode's Thai Green Curry. 'The food thing is a massive connection with John. To be able to talk about food, to love it, to be able to go out and eat and ask questions is amazing.'

Her love of food comes from her mother Julie, who died of throat cancer when Lisa was just 16. She was a talented amateur cook who inspired Lisa's first best-selling cookbook Recipes From My Mother For My Daughter, published last year.

 'Last year was difficult. Things were not happy and I had this thing about being 40'

'Mummy was ill for nearly two years and for a long time I was very angry about it. I was 15, 16. Suddenly I'd discovered boys. I was at a girl's school. I just wanted to go and have fun like all teenagers do. Now I think, “Why was I so awful?” But of course you don't think somebody's going to die when you're a teenager.

'I'm very like my mother in that she was an open book. You'd know the minute she came in and the door slammed she was in a bad mood. When she was fine, she'd close the door gently, say “Hi guys” and it was like the sun had come out. When she died it left me with a lot of guilt. I thought I was the worst daughter in the land.'

Actress turned property expert: Lisa was crowned Celebrity MasterChef 2010

It's the first time she's talked about her mother with such honesty. I suspect her happy relationship with John has a lot to do with it. He lost his mum when he was four. 'I was talking to somebody the other day and they said, “Once you can cope with losing your mum you can cope with anything.” I'll never, ever go through a day like the day she died again. It was the worst day ever.

'I remember saying goodbye to her to go to school. She was asleep and she squeezed my hand, but I didn't go to school. I bunked off. I was with my boyfriend and my poor father was driving around trying to find me. When I went home my grandparents were there and my grandad told me. I went upstairs to see her.' Lisa is in tears. 'It's funny how something will always, always affect you.

'Last year was difficult. Things were not happy and I had this thing about being 40. Mum died when she was 44 so in my head I was thinking, “When did it first start happening? Could this be my last happy year? Maybe I've got three happy years left.” Now I want to get past 44. For a long time I didn't see myself doing that. My dad said, “You're crazy.” I'd say, “But I can't see past it.” But now I can.

'I do live by my moods, but the sun does come out eventually. For now I'm having a really happy time and it's lovely not to be dreading autumn for the first time in years - really lovely.'

Lisa's second book, The Way I Cook..., is out Thursday (Simon & Schuster, £20).
