Death row: Kelly Renee Gissendaner (above), 46,  is now scheduled to be put to death on Monday

A mother-of-three who will become the first woman to be executed in Georgia in 70 years has been granted a few more days of life - thanks to the weather, despite her clemency being denied.

Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, had been scheduled to receive the lethal injection at 7pm on Wednesday at the state prison in Jackson, but the execution has now been reset for Monday, according to a Department of Corrections statement.

The department did not provide a reason, but a winter storm is forecast to hit parts of Georgia on Wednesday afternoon, closing schools and offices and prompting warnings about roads. 

Gissendaner, the only woman on death row in the state, was sentenced to death for plotting to have her husband Douglas murdered by her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, in suburban Atlanta in 1997.

On Tuesday, she had appealed to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles for clemency. The board listened to a full day of testimony, including from 21 people who asked for her life to be spared.

But on Wednesday morning, it announced her clemency plea had been denied and that she would be put to death as planned - making her the first woman to be executed in the state since 1945.

Gissendaner's lawyers had argued that she should be spared because she has found God and 'accepts full responsibility' for her role in the killing. She has reconciled with two of her three children, CBS46 reported.

In the clemency application, her daughter Kayla wrote: 'The impact of losing my mother would be devastating. I can't fathom losing another parent', 11Alive reported.

Gissendaner herself added in the application: 'There are no excuses for what I did. I will never understand how I let myself fall into such evil.'  

Arrest: Gissendaner, who is Georgia's only female death row inmate, was arrested in 1997 for plotting to kill her husband with her then-boyfriend, Gregory Owen (right), who ultimately testified against her

Victim: Douglas Gissendaner was stabbed multiple times in the neck by his wife's lover in 1997. Kelly Gissendaner wanted to divorce him but thought he would not leave her alone so plotted his death

Family: The couple had three children together; two of the children have now reconciled with their mother

But her husband's family continued to favor the death penalty, 11Alive reported. 

She is being put to death even though she was not the one to murder her husband. Owen, who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner repeatedly in the neck, is serving life behind bars after testifying against Gissendaner.

Still, authorities say she is responsible for the death.

'If it hadn't been for Kelly Gissendaner, Doug Gissendaner might still be alive,' Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter told WBS. 'He might have raised his children. He might have gone on. There are a lot of possibilities that were snuffed out in 1997 that she's responsible for.'   

Authorities said she had wanted to kill her husband - whom she had previously divorced and then re-married - because she wanted to split from him again but thought he would not leave her alone.

Gissendaner and Owen plotted the murder for months and Owen followed her orders to kill Douglas while she was out at a nightclub with friends on February 7, 1997,CNN reported.

Owen waited at the couple's home until Douglas arrived before kidnapping him and driving him to a remote area. He stole his watch and wallet to make the murder look like a robbery.  

He then beat Douglas across the head with a nightstick and stabbed him in the neck and back between eight and 10 times.

Kelly Gissendaner arrived as the murder took place but remained in her car. She later got out to make sure that her husband was dead before the pair took Douglas' vehicle and burned it using kerosene. The duo then left the scene.

Detective Doug Davis, who was working on the case, told CBS46: 'He must have been deeply in love with this woman is all I can say.' 

Douglas' burned-out car was found the following morning, and more than a week later the body was found a mile away. Animals had eaten away at the skin on Douglas' neck, making it hard for authorities to deduce which stab wound had killed him, CNN reported.

In the days before he was found, Kelly Gissendaner had appeared on local TV to appeal for help finding her husband - but she later admitted to police that she had been having an affair with Owen. 

Authorities interviewed him and on February 24, Owen confessed to the murder and implicated her.

While in jail, she plotted to pay someone $10,000 to falsely claim that they had driven her to the murder scene at gunpoint, but her cellmate alerted authorities to the plan.

Owen is serving life in prison in Washington state for his role in the murder. He avoided the death penalty after testifying against his former lover. 

She was sentenced to death in November 1998 after she was found guilty of her part in the death.

Gissendaner, who is incarcerated at Arrendale State Prison, is the only woman among 84 inmates facing the death penalty in Georgia, according to a report by the state's Department of Corrections.

She is set to be only the 14th woman executed in Georgia since 1735.

The last time a woman was executed was in 1945. Lena Baker was electrocuted in March of that year after she was convicted of murder for shooting her boss.

In 2005, the state pardoned her after agreeing with her family that she acted in self defense.

Gissendaner has requested a last meal of cornbread with a side of buttermilk; two Burger King Whoppers with cheese; two large orders of fries; cherry vanilla ice cream; popcorn; a salad with boiled eggs, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing; and lemonade, according to CBS46.

A rough estimate shows that the food contains more than 4,200 calories. 

Under Georgia law, only three offenses are punishable by death - murder, rape and kidnapping.

Pardoned: Lena Baker was pardoned in 2005

Lena Baker was an African-American maid who was sentenced to death by electric chair in 1945 for murdering her boss, Ernest Knight, in 1944.

In her trial, she explained that during an argument with Knight, he held her against her will and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave. She took his gun and fatally shot him before calling police and saying she had killed in self-defense.

But she was found guilty of capital murder by the all-white jury and sentenced to death. She was put to death using several electric shocks on March 5, 1945.

Her final words were: 'What I done, I did in self-defense, or I would have been killed myself. Where I was I could not overcome it. God has forgiven me. I have nothing against anyone. I picked cotton for Mr. Pritchett, and he has been good to me. I am ready to go. I am one in the number. I am ready to meet my God. I have a very strong conscience.'

But in August 2005, Baker received a posthumous pardon from the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, which said that the 1945 decision to deny Lena Baker clemency was 'a grievous error'. It ruled that she should have instead been charged with voluntary manslaughter, which would hav allowed her to avoid the death sentence.

In 2008, a movie, 'The Lena Baker Story', was released about her life.
