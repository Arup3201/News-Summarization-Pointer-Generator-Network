The military on Wednesday identified 17 of the 52 people onboard a C-124 Globemaster that crashed into a mountain outside Anchorage, Alaska, on Nov. 22, 1952.

The crash site was rediscovered two years ago, and testing has confirmed the identities of about a third onboard.

The military says the bodies of the other 35 crewmembers have not yet been recovered.

Identified: Air Force Col. Eugene Smith is one of 17 bodies from the 1952 wreck that have been positively identified

Air Force Col. Noel Hoblit's remains also have been identified as one of the 52 people killed in the wreck

Lt. Col. Lawrence S. Singleton is one of three Army men who died in the crash to be identified

The Douglas C-124C Globemaster II was the largest transport aircraft when it was introduced into service in 1950

The Department of Defense has released names and ranks for the service members, but not hometowns. Identified by military branch were:

From the U.S. Army, the DOD has identified the bodies of Lt. Col. Lawrence S. Singleton, Pvt. James Green Jr., and Pvt. Leonard A. Kittle.

Marine Corps Major Earl J. Stearns and Navy Commander Earl J. Stearns also have been identified.

Wreckage: The wreckage was discovered Colony Glacier, about 50 miles east of Anchorage

Slow process: Recovery teams want the grinding glacier, as it moves over time, to reveal more relics over what is expected to be a years-long project

The 12 remaining servicemen were from the Air Force and have been identified as Col. Noel E. Hoblit, Col. Eugene Smith, Capt. Robert W. Turnbull, 1st Lt. Donald Sheda, 1st Lt. William L. Turner, Tech. Sgt. Engolf W. Hagen, Staff Sgt. James H. Ray, Airman 1st Class Marion E. Hooton, Airman 2nd Class Carroll R. Dyer, Airman 2nd Class Thomas S. Lyons, Airman 2nd Class Thomas C. Thigpen, and Airman 3rd Class Howard E. Martin.

Relics from the plane first emerged last summer on Colony Glacier, about 50 miles east of Anchorage.

That discovery, by Alaska National Guard crews flying training missions out of Anchorage, put into motion a sophisticated recovery program carried out by the Hawaii-based Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command.

After last year's initial work - when nearly everything that rose to the glacier's surface was picked up - the JPAC team came back this summer to collect additional relics pushed out of the ice since then.

'As the glacier melts and the glacier moves, more material comes up to the surface,' Dr. Gregory Berg, the forensic anthropologist who leads the team of specialists examining the crevasse-ridden ice field, told reporters at a news briefing at the time.

Among the personal items collected from the crash site: A tiny fishing kit, a compass, a survival kit, a survival suit, a hockey puck, and a mini-box of Camel cigarettes.

Those and other items are being saved for a future memorial, said Doug Beckstead, a historian at Anchorage's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Berg and his team must tread carefully, skirting deadly crevasses and deep water-filled holes while trying to collect as many items and remains as possible.

They want the grinding glacier, as it moves over time, to reveal more relics over what is expected to be a years-long project, but they do not want it to carry the items all the way into the terminus lake, where they would likely be lost forever.

So far, only the lightest pieces have been pushed to the glacier's surface, and only a small portion of the 154-foot aircraft has emerged.

'We don't have all 52 guys lined up neatly, ready to be located,' Berg said.

The wrecked cargo plane, a C-124 Globemaster II, slammed into Mount Gannett in midwinter, an accident blamed on bad weather.

Although officials knew the site of the crash, remoteness and winter weather made recovery impossible at the time. The wreckage was soon buried under snow and gone from sight.

When finally spotted last year, the debris was 12 miles from the crash site, having been shifted by the glacier. The ice has flowed another 275 meters (902 feet) downslope since 2012, Berg said.

For Alaska-based military members supporting the JPAC effort, there is another mission: removing the crash debris that is not useful to the investigation.

All of the 52 military men onboard presumably were killed in the wreck

Over time, snow and ice accumulated over the wreckage, hiding it from anyone flying over the crash site

After the glacier covering the wreckage began to melt, recovery teams were able to locate the plane in 2012
