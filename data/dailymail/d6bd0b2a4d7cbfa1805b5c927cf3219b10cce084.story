She's as well-known for her stunning figure as she is for her chart-topping hits so it's perhaps no surprise that American songstress Taylor Swift is reported to be insuring her legs for a cool £26.5million.

Grammy-winning Taylor, 25, attributes a huge slice of her global success to her energetic stage performances and her team have apparently looked into how much it would cost to insure her legs against potential career-threatening accidents. 

The Pennsylvania-raised star is embarking upon a global tour in May and the move is said to be a precaution against such a physically-demanding schedule.

Diamonds in those heels: Taylor Swift's super-slim legs have reportedly been insured for a whopping £26.5million ahead of her gruelling world tour which begins in May 

Prized assets: Taylor's pins, on display (left) at the Saturday Night Live anniversary special last month, are considered a key part of her high-energy stage performances. Showing them off at a pre-Grammy Gala in LA in February (right)

The Blank Space singer is reported to have said she was 'embarrassed' at how much her slender limbs are said to be worth.

Celebrity insurers Lloyd's, which has specialised in offering body-part policies since the 1930s, said they were not surprised by the vast sums attributed to Taylor's pins. Underwriter Jonathan Thomas told FEMAIL: 'Taylor Swift’s income-generating capacity is hugely dependent upon her stage presence and thus her exceptional legs are indeed very likely worth millions of dollars of insurance.'

She's certainly not the first celebrity to insure herself, however, with a whole host of other stars on record for ensuring their prize assets, which they often consider the key to their success, are protected by policy.

Long before Kim Kardashian's derriere arrived on the scene, Jennifer Lopez famously insured her perfectly-round bottom for millions of dollars. Australian singer Kylie Minogue, whose rear grabbed the headlines in gold hotpants in the video for hit single Spinning Around back in 2000 was said to have insured her behind shortly after to the tune of £3million.

Dolly Parton is as well-known for her 40DD chest as she is for her back-catalogue of country music hits and is alleged to have once insured them for £3.8million - or £1.9million each. Bruce Springsteen's relentless live dates contribute hugely to his overall fortune so he needs more than the price of honey and lemon to keep his voice safe - the vocal chords of 'the Boss' are covered for up to £3million. 

For obvious reasons, sports stars can also have high premiums attached to certain parts of their anatomies. Although it's common practice for football clubs to insure against injury, a career-threatening tackle on a higher-profile star could potentially lose the club millions in sponsorship deals.

In 2006, it was revealed that David Beckham had insured his cross-whipping legs against injury for around £100million while playing for Paris Saint-Germain. While in 2013, Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo's club Real Madrid renewed their insurance for his lightning-quick legs at a cost estimated to be around £74million.

Legs eleven: When David Beckham was competing at a professional level, his goal-scoring limbs had a whopping £100million price tag on them. The Boss, aka Bruce Springsteen, is so protective of his lucrative voice that he's insured it for £3million

No need for a stuntman: 007 star Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own action scenes in the 2008 Bond film Quantam of Solace...at a cost of £5million in insurance

In 2008, Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own stunts for Bond film Quantam of Solace. 

'He does a lot more than Pierce used to do,' said the film's chief stunt coordinator Gary Powell at the time, '...and he's allowed to because he's capable of doing it. He thinks, "You're paying to see me, and that's me doing it." He wants the audience to know.' 

It might have given the film's makers a headache though, for such daredevilry came at an eye-watering insurance price, said to be £5million.

A head for business: The Only Way is Essex star Joey said last year that he would insure his perfectly coiffured hair for £1million...shortly after launching his D:Reem range of hair products for Tesco

Good golly, Miss Dolly: Country star Ms Parton has protected her surgically-enhanced bosom for £3.8million while trailing in her wake is reality tv star Holly Madison, who has a similar chest-protecting policy for £66,000

Million-dollar smile, literally. Film actress Julia Roberts was the subject of an insurance policy that saw her pearly whites covered for just shy of £20million

Becoming savvy about protecting career-boosting parts of the body isn't a new phenomenon. As early as the 1930s celebrities became aware of how much certain bits of them can influence their success. 

Specialist insurers Lloyd’s say the entertainment industry developing in California in the early 20th century quickly appreciated just how much a film could gross if its central star's appearance was just right. 

Early film stars such as Cyd Charisse’s (legs) and Jimmy Durante (nose) chose the company to provide them with policies. Present-day clients include  burlesque star Holly Madison’s breasts and NFL player Troy Polamalu’s hair.
