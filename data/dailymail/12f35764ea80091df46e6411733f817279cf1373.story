Attack: Gary Hindley, 56, leaves Thames Magistrates' Court today after being given a 12-week suspended sentence

The parents of a six-year-old girl who lost her ear when she was savaged by a dog reacted with fury yesterday after its owner was spared jail.

Gary Hindley, 56, walked free from court after being handed a 12-week suspended sentence and ordered to pay just £350 compensation for the ‘sustained and horrific attack’ in which his Staffordshire bull terrier bit off most of her right ear.

Yesterday the victim’s parents described the sentence as an insult.

The little girl was testing her Christmas presents – a telescope and binoculars – on a family day out to Epping Forest, Essex, with her parents and younger brother when the attack happened on January 21.

Yesterday, in a statement read to Thames Magistrates’ Court, the mother said: ‘The dog was on my little girl, standing on her, with his head buried into her.

‘My daughter was screaming, “Get it off, get it off”. I came round the back and tried to grab it but I couldn’t get it off. I threw myself over her body trying to do everything in my power to protect her. My daughter was screaming and I was trying to grab the dog around the middle but it was pure muscle and I could not move it.’

The dog only let go when her  husband punched it. As the dog  was pulled back, it sank its teeth  into his wife’s scalp and ripped her hair out.

After the two-minute attack the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to hospital suffering head and neck injuries.

Escaped jail: Hindley leaves the court today with his face covered after he avoided a prison sentence. He was ordered to pay the girl £450 compensation as part of his punishment

She has since undergone cosmetic surgery and faces further operations to reconstruct her ear.

District Judge Robert Roscoe 
admonished Hindley, who lived near the scene of the attack, for 
vanishing after giving the girl’s father a false address.

Hindley, 
unemployed, who had only had the 16-month-old pet for four months, 
handed himself into the police the following morning.

Yesterday he was given a 12-week jail 
sentence suspended for two years. He was banned from owning any animal 
for ten years after admitting allowing his dog to be dangerously out of 
control in a public place and causing injury.

He was ordered to pay £350 in 
compensation and £100 court costs. He must carry out 200 hours of unpaid
work and wear an electronic tag.

The judge also ordered that the dog, named Buddy, be destroyed.

Judge Roscoe told Hindley: ‘You were 
not doing your duty to protect other people in the park and it resulted 
in a sustained and horrific attack on a child.’

But outside court, the girl’s father 
said: ‘Where is the deterrent? Where is the justice? How is this going 
to stop it happening again, it’s an absolute insult.

‘My six-year-old daughter screams in pain for an hour every day while we’re changing her dressing.

‘If he had a knife in his hands and 
used it on my daughter, he would have been locked away for a long time. 
What is the difference to what he did with his dog?’
