The New York City subway is cramped with people, but a new study shows that the underground system may be much more crowded than we realized.

Scientists from Weill Cornell Medical College have unveiled their findings after 18 months swabbing turnstiles, ticket kiosks, railings and benches for DNA on the world's largest transport system.

They found 15,152 different types of microorganisms that share the train with its 5.5 million riders, including bubonic plague, dysentery and meningitis.

Principal Investigator Dr Chris Mason and his team released findings from their 'PathoMap' study on Thursday, a map of all the microorganisms and DNA present on surfaces in the New York City subway.  

The study, which used a super computer to study more than 10 billion biomedical fragments, was apparently inspired by Dr Mason seeing his daughter, then in preschool, sticking toys in her mouth in 2010.

Scientists and volunteers started the project in 2013 and found 637 known bacterial, viral, fungal and animal species when swabbing the spaces between commuters and street musicians and logging the data in real time with a mobile app.

Most of the bacteria the group found were harmless, though nearly half (48 per cent) of the DNA found matched no known organisms, according to the published study at Cell.com.

The red areas show the areas with the most bacteria, according to their findings, while the cooler colours reveal less bacteria

Pictured are some of the most popular stations in New York, along with a common type of bacteria found in the area. Many are associated  with different diseases such as food poisoning and infections

The New York subway system is famous for being grimy - but commuters may not have realised just how much until now. Traces of anthrax and the Bubonic plague have been found in central areas (pictured)

Bacteria linked to diseases including bubonic plague and staph infections (left) are found at a number of stations around the city, along with dysentery and meningitis

The mysterious finding 'underscores the vast wealth of unknown species that are ubiquitous in urban areas,' project leader Ebrahim Afshinnekoo said. 

Researchers also saw 67 different bacteria species associated with diseases on the subway's surfaces in about 12 per cent of their samples, though bacteria in general made up nearly 47 per cent.

Some bacteria associated with ailments such as food poisoning are found at nearly half of the 466 open stations shared by germs, riders and rats.

Thankfully, more serious bacteria are less common. 

The most diverse station was the G train's Myrtle-Willoughby stop in Brooklyn, with 95 different bacteria

The microbes associated with dysentery was only found at three stations, as was the bacteria that causes bubonic plague.

Scientists, who include researchers from six New York medical centers and other institutions around the world, said that the plague microbes were shown not to be alive.

The New York City Department of Health disputed the finding of plague on the subway,  according to the Wall Street Journal.

The most diverse station was the G train's Myrtle-Willoughby stop in Brooklyn, with 95 different bacteria groups.

South Ferry station, which was submerged and temporarily closed after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, showed unique sets of bacteria normally found in marine environments.

Dr Chris Mason said that someone who licks a subway pole (held above by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg) would 'probably be fine'

Scientists said that most of the harmful bacteria are found in low quantities and good or neutral bacteria may be out-competing them. 

Bubonic plague  found at 3 stations  

Dysentery 3 stations

E. Coli 56 stations

Food poisoning 215 stations

Meningitis 9 stations

Strep infections 66 stations 

Tetanus 9 stations 

City dwellers' immune systems are also equipped to handle all the microbes thrown at them during the typical day. 

'You wouldn't want to lick all the poles, even though you'd probably be fine,' Dr Mason said. 

The principal investigator advocated exposing young children to germs when speaking at the American Museum of Natural History, according to Gothamist.

'The best thing to do with newborns is roll them like sushi on the subway ground,' he said.

Researchers also mapped  microorganisms that were not bacteria, including those that likely came from popular New York foodstuffs such as Italian mozzarella and kimchi.

215 stations in New York had traces of bacteria associated with food poisoning such as salmonella (pictured)

The most common DNA besides bacteria came from insects, plant matter and humans, who represented 0.2 per cent of the material collected. 

The PathoMap study hopes to eventually create a 'weather map' or microscopic organisms to be able to warn people about potential disease outbreaks.  

Scientists believe studying how microbes move around urban environments will help them keep track of long-term health trends.

Other researchers in 14 states are undertaking similar projects to map the microbes in transit systems. 

Subway studies are also underway in Shanghai, Tokyo, Paris and Sao Paulo.
