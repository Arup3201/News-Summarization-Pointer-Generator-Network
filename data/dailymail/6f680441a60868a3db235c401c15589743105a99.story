Prince Andrew was under growing pressure last night to testify on oath about his contacts with alleged underage ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts.

She lodged fresh documents at a Florida court saying her lawyers had served an extraordinary letter on the Duke last week requesting he answer questions – but he ‘refused’ to accept it.

Miss Roberts also issued a stinging attack on ‘false and hurtful’ denials of her claims made by Andrew in the tumultuous past three weeks.

She claimed his police bodyguards left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was involved in an orgy with the prince and eight other young girls.

Miss Roberts’ lawyers sent Buckingham Palace a letter (above) requesting his ‘voluntary cooperation in answering question about his sexual interactions’ with her

Buckingham Palace has strenuously rejected claims the Duke had any ‘sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts.

Last week, Miss Roberts’ lawyers sent by FedEx couriers an unprecedented letter addressed to ‘His Royal Highness The Duke of York’ at Buckingham Palace requesting his ‘voluntary cooperation in answering question about his sexual interactions’ with her.

It is not known whether Prince Andrew is covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law.

However, the prince may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a Whitehall-sanctioned business envoy. Diplomatic immunity protects foreign diplomats from legal action in the country where they work.

Extradition lawyer Karen Todner said the prince could be formally asked to give evidence ‘only in criminal proceedings’. If he refused to co-operate, he could in theory be banned from entering America.

The letter offered to interview the prince under oath ‘at a time and place of your choosing’. But her lawyers stated: ‘Federal Express has informed us that the letter has been refused by the recipient.’

The latest documents filed at Palm Beach court house in Florida make plain Miss Roberts’s determination to pursue the Prince – who she said ‘I just called “Andy”.’

She alleges she was a sex slave loaned out by paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein to his friend Andrew when she was aged 17 in 2001, claiming: ‘Whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got.’

The latest bombshell came as a shock to Buckingham Palace officials last night as they arrived in Switzerland with Andrew to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The Prince, who is today due to give a much-anticipated speech to business leaders, was sitting down with his advisers when details of the papers began to drop last night.

In her latest court salvo, Miss Roberts states: ‘I have seen Buckingham Palace’s recent “emphatic” denial that Prince Andrew had sexual contact with me. That denial is false and hurtful to me. I did have sexual contact with him as I have described…under oath.

In new documents, Miss Roberts (left) launched a stinging attack on the Duke's (right) denials of her allegations. She claims they had sex when she was 17

‘Given what he knows and has seen, I was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything. I hope my attorneys can interview Prince Andrew under oath about the contacts and that he will tell the truth.’

She said she had directed her lawyers ‘to pursue all reasonable and legitimate means to bring criminal charges against these powerful people for the crimes they have committed against me and other girls.’

She added: ‘If a judge wants me to present my information in more detail, including more specific descriptions of the sexual activities with the men Epstein sent me to, I could do so.’

She also denies having sex with former US President Bill Clinton.

The letter served on Andrew was written by lawyer Jack Scarola, dated January 14, and included the now-notorious photo of the Prince posing next to Miss Roberts.

He told the Prince: ‘This letter is a formal request…to interview you, under oath, regarding interactions that you had with Jane Doe No. 3 [the name used by Miss Roberts in legal proceedings] beginning in approximately early 2001. Jane Doe No. 3 was then 17 years old. Among other things, I would like to discuss events that occurred at the time that the photograph below was taken — and shortly thereafter.

‘I would also like to discuss Jane Doe 3’s claims of your subsequent interactions with her in New York City, New York later that year.

‘Details of those claims have been widely reported in the British press (with varying degrees of accuracy) as have your denials of the claims , so I assume that it is unnecessary for me to be any more specific about the proposed areas of our inquiry.

‘The interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing, and with your cooperation,’

The letter tops a damaging three weeks for Andrew since he was sensationally accused in U.S. court papers of abusing Miss Roberts when she 17.

She alleged that under the orders of billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, she was ‘forced’ to have sex with him three times in 2001 - in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island.

Andrew, 54, fiercely denies ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts and has consulted top criminal QC William Clegg.

Last night Miss Roberts spelt out for the first time in court papers the detail of her allegations against the Prince, Epstein and their mutual friend Ghislaine Maxwell – daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell.

Miss Roberts stated: ‘Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times. I had sex with him three times, including one orgy. I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just called him “Andy.”’

She said the first instance of sexual contact happened in London at Miss Maxwell’s townhouse. ‘I got news from Maxwell that I would be meeting a prince. Later that day, Epstein told me I was meeting a “major prince.”

‘Epstein told me “to exceed” everything I had been taught. He emphasised that whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got.’

‘Eventually Prince Andrew arrived, along with his security guards. The guards then went out of the house and stayed out front in their car. It was just Epstein, Maxwell, and me inside alone with Andy. I was introduced to the Prince, and we kissed formally, cheek to cheek. Maxwell said “guess how old she is.” Prince Andrew guessed 17.’

Smiling coyly for the camera in a simple white blouse, this is Virginia Roberts around the time she has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her.

The photograph was taken by paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the man she says turned her into a ‘sex slave’ and procured her for the Queen’s son.

The snapshot is one of five photos included in Miss Roberts’s new legal submission to show how young she looked. ‘I was approximately 17 at the time,’ she said.

She adds: ‘I visited and travelled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of 2002.

‘I had sex with him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex with.’ She said she included the photos to ‘illustrate my connection to these places’.

Andrew took her to Tramp club before they returned to the townhouse where she and the Prince allegedly ‘went to the bathroom and bedroom…We engaged in sexual activities there. Afterwards, Andy left quickly with his security.’

The legal documents filed yesterday say that although Buckingham Palace has ‘recently denied that Prince Andrew had sexual contact’ with Miss Roberts, ‘it has not attempted to explain what led to the Prince having his picture taken with his arm around a 17 year old American girl at night in London in an intimate setting in a private residence’.

The Duke of York - who strongly denies the claims 0 has enlisted the help of QC William Clegg (pictured), nicknamed the 'grandfather of the bar' 

‘Nor has the Palace explained what Ghislaine Maxwell is doing there and who took that picture – while Jane Doe 3 (Miss Roberts) has provided a sworn affidavit that the photographer was Prince Andrew’s close friend (as well as sex trafficker and now registered sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein.’

In her statement, Miss Roberts said that in 2011, while living in Australia, she was interviewed by two FBI agents about her allegations.

Last night a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We have nothing to say in addition to our earlier comments on the issue.’

Previously, the Palace has said ‘any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue’, adding: ‘The Duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case’

Epstein, 61, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for paedophile offences. But he only served 13 months behind bars. This was due to a controversial plea bargain agreement between his ‘army of legal superstars’ and the U.S Government.

A spokesperson for Miss Maxwell, 53, daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, has strongly denied the allegations.

Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz - who is also named in the court papers - said the claims against him were part of a pattern of “made-up stories” by Miss Roberts (chck) and her lawyers against prominent people.
