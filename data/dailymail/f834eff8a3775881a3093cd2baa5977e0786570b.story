The words Louis Vuitton and Karl Lagerfeld used in one sentence should have warned you of a high price tag, however this collaboration packs a particularly pricey punch.

The German designer has collaborated with the French fashion house in order to produce a range of luxury boxing equipment.

The collection includes a set of gloves, a gym bag and the cream of the crop, a custom-made leather trunk with a punch bag tucked inside.

The custom-made punch bag is housed with a monogrammed luggage case for fashionable fighters on the go

The bag takes between six and 12 months to build and was designed by Karl Lagerfeld.

It boasts an aged cowhide leather trim with golden-brass hardware and includes four inside compartments and two zipped pockets. 

With the bag removed and attached to its stand, the trunk can be used as a travel closet.

As well as the case and the bag, the set also includes a monogrammed mat and a pair of boxing gloves.

The set also includes a pair of leather boxing gloves worth almost £5000

The four-part set is part of a series of six collaborations that Louis Vuitton has undertaken with artists and designers including Cindy Sherman, Frank Gehry and Rei Kawakubo, with Karl being the latest to join the ranks. 

The bag housed within the leather trunk will set you back no less than £69,000 ($175,000) but if you are prepared to simply punch a pillow you can purchase yourself a pair of gloves at the reduced price of £3,700.

Karl Lagerfeld has previously included sporting accessories in his Chanel shows, this surfboard was featured during the SS03 catwalk

As part of the Fuoripista collection these cutting-edge skis, released last year, were stamped with a oversized Chanel logo and retailed at £2,480

This is not the first time that Karl has dabbled in luxury sportswear, having previously created surfboards, skis and dumbbells for Chanel.

Those of you keen to invest in the knock-out accessory had better hurry, as there are currently only 25 in production.

This latest workout accessory has already provoked outrage in the sporting world  with boxer Ricky Hatton posting his disapproval of the over priced product on twitter.

The former world champion posted a picture of an advert for the kit on Twitter, along with the message: 'The world's gone f***ing mad.'
