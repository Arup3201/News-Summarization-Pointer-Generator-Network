Nearly 100 people have been  arrested in China for spreading doomsday rumours.

They include members of a banned anti-communist cult called Almighty God who handed out leaflets forecasting that the sun will stop shining and electricity will not work from December 21, the Chinese state media said.

Almighty God has also called for a ‘decisive battle’ to slay the ‘Red Dragon’ Communist Party.

Doomsday: Some fear the Mayans believe the world will end on or around December 21 as that is when their calendar ends

State media also reported that a knifeman who injured 23 children in a school in Henan province claimed he was ‘psychologically affected’ by the predictions of an apocalypse on December 21.

The 93 arrests in seven provinces highlight the authorities’ struggle to smother internet rumours, which they believe threaten communist rule.

The state media said the 93 people were arrested for 'handing out leaflets about the apocalypse and spreading rumours'.

'These cult members recently latched on to the Mayan doomsday scenario to predict the sun will not shine and electricity will not work for three days beginning on December 21,' Xinhua said, citing the public security bureau of Xining, capital of the southwestern province of Qinghai.

China has launched a crackdown on the 'Almighty God' group, which has also called for a decisive battle” to slay the 'Red Dragon' Communist Party.

China’s Communist Party brooks no challenge to its rule and is very keen to maintain social stability. But it has struggled to clamp down on rumours, which often spread quickly on the Internet.
