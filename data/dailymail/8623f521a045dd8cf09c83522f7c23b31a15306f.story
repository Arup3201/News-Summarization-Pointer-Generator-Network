Booze prices in the Commons have been frozen again - even though MPs' food and drink is subsidised by millions of pounds a year.

Taxpayers are forced to stump up £7million a year to keep restaurant and bar bills down in Parliament.

This allows pints of beer to cost as little as £2.90 in the Commons and Lords' exclusive riverside bars. 

The public subsidy for MPs' food and drink runs into the millions every year, House of Commons figures reveal

Senior MPs on the Finance and Services Committee have revealed that charges will be kept on hold until at least next May.

Once inflation is taken into account, the booze prize freeze is actually a cut.

The freeze also means prices will have been only been raised three times in the five years of the current Parliament.

By the time the price freeze ends, MPs will have landed a ten per cent pay hike, with salaries due to rise to £74,000.

Taxpayers' Alliance chief Jonathan Isaby said: 'What planet are these MPs living on? Food and drink prices have not been frozen for the rest of us, so why should it be any different for our elected representatives?

'No wonder politicians seem out of touch. It's time for a sobering reality check - taxpayers shouldn't be subsidising cheap alcohol.'

But a Commons spokeswoman said: 'Benchmark prices have not moved significantly and current targets to drive sales and control costs are being met.'

Last year it was revealed that the bars, restaurants and cafes in the House of Commons cost taxpayers £4.9million in 2012/13 - a subsidy of £7,500 per MP.

The eight venues selling food and drink in the Lords needed a further £2.3million of public cash, according to freedom of information. This meant the total subsidy for both houses was £7.2million.

The revelation comes after MPs signed off on plans to spend more than £200,000 doing up Parliament's most exclusive restaurant.

The plush Strangers’ Dining Room will be almost entirely refurbished, House of Commons authorities have confirmed.

A ten-week touch up will take place during the MPs’ summer holiday this year - with the carpets, curtains and fireplaces set to be given an overhaul.

A Commons spokesman claimed the refurbishment would pay for itself - because it is can be hired out when MPs are away from Parliament on recess.

It is not only MPs who benefit from cheap food and drink prices in Parliament. Taxpayers are being stung for more than £1million a year to subsidise restaurants, bars and cafes for members of the House of Lords as well.

The peers’ fine dining discount comes on top of the £300 per day they get for attending the Lords, which is supposed to cover their food as well as accommodation.

We paid £757,696 in 2011-12 to subsidise Westminster’s Peers’ Dining Room, where lords, bishops and baronesses can enjoy a starter of marinated king scallops with baby fennel, blood orange, puffed pork rind and crisp shallots for just £7.

The self-service River Restaurant offers more everyday dishes at bargain prices – thanks to a handout of £501,646 from the taxpayer.

Another £246,307 of our money went to the plush Barry Room restaurant, where only £6 will buy a hungry peer a starter of quail with pancetta popcorn, sweetcorn and red onions.

But a spokesman for the Lords said: 'The Lord catering subsidy has been reduced by 27 per cent since 2007 and the House continues to focus on seeking further savings.

'Our catering services meet the needs of working House of Parliament and due to the unpredictable nature of sittings of the House, and periods where the House doesn’t sit and so revenue is not generated, a subsidy is unavoidable.

'As a London Living Wage employer catering costs for the Lords are higher than many commercial operations where staff are paid at below that rate.'
