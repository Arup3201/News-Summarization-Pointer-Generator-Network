Offensive? Brittany Molina posted what she was wearing when handed the 'fashion advice' from a male student at Brigham Young University, Utah

Being Valentine's Day, it might have been hoped that an impromptu letter would be filled with admiring comments and sweet remarks.

Unfortunately for one young woman she was passed a note by a fellow student.. offering some stern words about her sense of style.

Brittany Molina, 21, who studies accountancy at Brigham Young University, Utah, was walking through campus when a young man approached her with a sheet of paper - and then dashed away.Â 

On Valentine's Day, Miss Molina posted on Twitter: 'So this boy came up to me... I thought he was giving me a love note. Turns out...'

The
 'helpful', handwritten advice reads: 'You may want to consider that what you're 
wearing has a negative effect on men (and women) around you.

'Many
 people come to this university because they feel safe, morally as well 
as physically, here.

'They expect others to abide by the Honor Code that 
we all agreed on.

'Please consider your commitment to the Honor Code (which you agreed to) when dressing each day. Thank you.'

Miss Molina then wrote on Twitter: 'I'll remember to dress in jeans, a sweatshirt and tennis shoes tomorrow. That way I don't make people feel uncomfortable.'

Dozens of the student's followers have commented on the derisory 'Valentine'.

Although most comments were supportive of Miss Molina there were words of support for the unknown letter writer.

One student tweeted to Miss Molina: 'Sweetie, I think it's cuz your cleavage is showing.  Lookt @ all ur 
flickr pics & u show 2 much sometimes. Wear a tanktop under.'

Brigham Young University was founded and continues to be supported by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Happy Valentine's Day: The note was handed to 21-year-old student at BYU which is heavily influenced by Mormonism

The college is heavily influenced by Mormonism and offers students the opportunity to not only study but to focus on their faith.

Students must follow on honor code which along with abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, coffee and swearing, asks that they follow a dress code.

BYU requires that female students don't dress in revealing or form-fitting clothing and that skirts are knee-length or longer. Excessive piercings and 'extreme' hairstyles are also banned.
