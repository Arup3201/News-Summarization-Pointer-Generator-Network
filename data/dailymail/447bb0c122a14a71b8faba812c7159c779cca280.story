Good Morning America viewers got a fruity surprise to go along with their cereal today when Nicki Minaj suffered a rather disastrous wardrobe malfunction on air.

The 28-year-old Moment 4 Life singer fell out of her tight crop top during a live performance for the  GMA Concert Series.

The Super Bass singer's double-sided tape failed her in a time of need and she popped out of the tiny green tank she wore on stage in Central Park.

The embarrassing moment aired live on the East Coast of the U.S. but was edited out for other time zones.

Over-exposed: The singer was obliviously to her costume disaster

Unfortunately for Nicki, she was so immersed in warbling Where Them Girls At that she didn't seem to notice the slip.

But viewers certainly did - and immediately took to Twitter to comment on the over-exposure.

Caught on camera: The moment aired live on the East Coast, but was edited out of broadcasts in other time zones

'Two special guests on Good Morning America today, Nicki Minaj AND her nipple,' tweeted one user.

And the Parents Television Council was quick to blast the TV show, noting that it it could have been avoided if a five-second delay was implemented.

'For the umpteenth time in recent 
memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for 
children and families,' PTC president Tim Winter told TMZ.

'Instead of asking for forgiveness, 
they need to stop apologizing and implement the five second delay that 
so many Americans have been calling for.'

A
spokesperson for the network insists there is a delay in place, but 
producers didn't notice the slip-up until it was too late.

Spilling out: The singer's flimsy outfit failed to contain her cleavage

The representative said: 'Although we had a five-second delay in place for the Nicki Minaj concert on GMA , the live East Coast feed of the concert regrettably included certain fleeting images of the performer that were taken out of later feeds of the broadcast in other time zones.'

'We are sorry that this occurred.'

Nicki was wearing a typically outrageous outfit for the performance, which also included a clear, pink-trimmed plastic skirt, leopard print Wellies and newsprint leggings. 

Her huge yellow hoop earrings were almost as big as her head, as were the multi-coloured bangles she wore.

Loving the attention: Nicki re-tweeted this complimentary message from a fan after her performance

Hot pink lipstick, a keyboard ring and a massive head of frizzed-out blonde wig completed her zany look.

She used a turkey leg as a prop for no apparent reason and took a gigantic, satisfying bite before discarding it.

She jumped up and down while rapping into her pink, jewel-encrusted microphone while dancers in tutus swirled around her.

What just happened? The Super Bass singer looks a little shell-shocked. Was it because of her wardrobe malfunction?

Nicki then thanked the crowd for pushing her aptly-titled album Pink Friday to platinum status since its release.

'I grew up in New York City. I never
imagined myself playing in Central Park with a bunch of beautiful 
people like this. I am New York to the fullest,' she told the audience.

The new MAC Viva Glam spokesperson is currently the opening act for Britney Spears' Femme Fatale tour.
