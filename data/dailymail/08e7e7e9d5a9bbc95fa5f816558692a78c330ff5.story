Scheme: Nicky Morgan has unveiled a multi-million pound initiative urging schools to give character-building the same weight as academic subjects

Schools are being urged to give character-building the same weight as academic subjects under a multi-million pound initiative unveiled by Nicky Morgan.

The Education Secretary insisted that instilling resilience and ‘grit’ in pupils was just as important as helping them achieve good grades.

She announced details of a £5million fund aimed at helping schools offer classes and activities which foster traits such as self-control, commitment, endeavour and humour.

The Department for Education said the scheme was intended ‘to place character education on a par with academic learning for pupils across the country’.

The move marks a shift in focus following major reforms to the school curriculum which came into force earlier this year.

It follows warnings from business leaders and Ofsted that school-leavers are ill-equipped for the workplace and lack professional attitudes to time-keeping, team-working and communication.

Mrs Morgan has already announced £5million to be spent on projects which aim to harness the military values of respect, leadership and discipline to improve behaviour and achievement.

However the new emphasis on character-building being encouraged in schools has prompted concerns in some quarters that core academic subjects could be squeezed.

Mrs Morgan insisted that developing traits such as perseverance in the face of setbacks, confident debating skills and community spirit were ‘equally important’ to pupils as securing good grades.

The scheme was a ‘milestone in preparing young people more than ever before for life in modern Britain’.

‘It will provide a boost to those already doing great work, while also helping excellent projects get off the ground,’ she said.

‘Excellent teachers already produce well-rounded pupils and today’s news will give more schools the support, inspiration and resources to go even further.’

The initiative would turn England into a ‘global leader in teaching character and resilience’, she said.

Under the scheme, schools and community groups will bid for a share of a £3.5million pot to run character-building initiatives. Projects can be based either inside or outside school but must provide evidence they will boost results, behaviour or job prospects.

A further £500,000 will be used to fund prizes for schools which excel in character-building in an attempt to encourage heads across the country to offer a broader education within existing budgets.

An additional £1million will be invested in research into the most effective ways of teaching character.

Ministers are also holding up a series of examples of successful projects already underway in a bid to inspire more schools to embrace the idea.

These include King Solomon Academy, in north west London, which has introduced ‘character-based rewards’ for good behaviour and effort. It has also introduced productions of unabridged Shakespeare plays for pupils aged 11 upwards.

Meanwhile School 21, a free school in Stratford, east London has developed a rich well-being curriculum that stresses the importance of self-control, humour and charity. The school day includes time for students to ‘master’ personal goals, such as grammar, an instrument or a language.

It has identified 21 qualities as attributes of a successful student and provides leadership and debating classes to enhance pupil’s assertiveness and public speaking skills.

And at Outwood Academy Portland, in Worksop, Notts, more than 100 after-school classes are offered ranging from extra English and maths to an orchestra, choir and debating club.

In a dramatic turnaround, the school has won an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted rating having been among the worst in the country just over two years ago. Principal Dr Phillip Smith says the introduction of a broad range of extra-curricular activities has been instrumental in the school’s success.
