Sheldon Silver, the under fire Speaker of the New York State Assembly, has agreed to temporarily relinquish his powers as he battles federal corruption charges.

The Democrat, who has served as the highest-ranking state assemblyman since 1994, will become a virtual figurehead today but will not permanently quit his post.

Silver's decision comes days after he was taken into custody by the FBI on federal conspiracy and bribery charges that could carry a term of up to 100 years in prison.

His lawyers said they were 'disappointed' with the 'meritless criminal charges'. They also said the politician expects to be fully exonerated.

The 70-year-old will temporarily delegate his duties as speaker to a group of senior Assembly members, according to the New York Times. 

He has reportedly faced increasing pressure from Democrats in the assembly who were concerned that the criminal charges could impact his ability to carry out duties. 

Silver's spokesperson Michael Whyland said Silver is appointing senior members to take on responsibilities including budget negotiations to ensure a timely spending plan for the state, reported the New York Post.

Whyland said this will give Silver the flexibility he needs so that he can defend himself against charges - with Silver confident that he will be found innocent.

The delegation of duties will go to a five-person group which includes Herman 'Denny' Farrell of Harlem and Joe Morelle of Rochester, Joseph Lentol of Brooklyn, Cathy Nolan of Queens And Carl Heastie of The Bronx under the plan developed Sunday, sources told the Post.

As one of the most powerful politicians in the state, Silver was taken into custody last Thursday and was later charged at Manhattan federal court with taking $4million in bribes disguised as legal fees. He was released on $200,000 bail.

He is also accused of earning $700,000 from a real estate law firm which got work from developers he favored.

Last week, New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, came to Silver's defense, describing him as a 'man of integrity', and said he did not think he should step down citing his 'due process rights'. 

Silver is set to face the Assembly's Democratic caucus today for the first time following his arrest.

Along with the Senate majority leader and the governor, Silver plays a major role in creating state budgets, laws and policies in a system long criticized in Albany as 'three men in a room.' 

He controls, for example, which lawmakers sit on which committees and decides whether a bill gets a vote. 

Silver would lose his seat if convicted of any of five felony counts and faces a maximum of 20 years of prison on each count.

At least 30 New York politicians have faced legal or ethics charges since 2000.

Silver's longtime Senate counterpart, Joseph Bruno, was acquitted in May at a retrial on bribery charges.

One of his predecessors as speaker, Mel Miller, was convicted of corruption in the early 1990s, but the conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court.

Two former state Senate Democratic leaders, John Sampson and Malcolm Smith, are facing criminal charges.
