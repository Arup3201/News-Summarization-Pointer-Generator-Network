Argentinian model Fiorella Castillo claims to have defeated 800 men on Ipanema beach at freestyling, but isn't done putting her opposite sex to shame just yet.

The 24-year-old has set her sights on arguably the best player on the planet - Lionel Messi - and wants to show the Argentina and Barcelona maestro her silky skills.

You wouldn't put it past Castillo, either, given her latest video that shows her juggling the ball and doing tricks on the sand in Brazil.
