Three Japanese-born scientists have won the Nobel Prize in physics for inventing blue-light emitting diodes (LEDs) that have revolutionised the lighting industry. 

Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and U.S. scientist Shuji Nakamura won the award for their 1990s invention, which has led to the use of environmentally-friendly light sources worldwide.

But when Nakamura invented the technology in 1993, the company he worked for at the time awarded him the equivalent of just £125 ($200) - despite the idea being worth a potential £50 billion ($80 billion) by 2020 according to estimates.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the invention is just 20 years old, 'but it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all.' In this image Shuji Nakamura demonstrates different LED lights during a presentation in Santa Barbara

Shuji Nakamura invented the blue light-emitting-diode while working for the Nichia Corporation in Tokushima, Japan in 1993.

Estimates suggest the technology, used in everything from homes to billboards today, will be worth £50 billion ($80 billion) in 2020 according to Quartz.

But when he first came up with Nichia rewarded him with just 20,000 yen (£125 or $200), as Japanese firms favoured the mentality that work for an employer was not a means for personal glory.

However Nakamura quit and moved to the US in 2000, before counter-suing in 2001 after Nichia attempted to sue him for infringing trade secrets.

107 Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded between 1901-2013.

47 Physics Prizes have been given to one Laureate only.

2 women have been awarded the Physics Prize so far.

1 person, John Bardeen, has been awarded the Physics Prize twice.

25 years was the age of the youngest Physics Laureate ever, Lawrence Bragg, when he was awarded the 1915 Physics Prize together with his father.

55 is the average age of the Physics Laureates the year they were awarded the prize.

He was ultimately awarded £5.04 million ($8.1 million) for the idea, reported as the largest payout ever made to an employee for an invention.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that while the technology is just 20 years old, 'it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all.'

Akasaki, 85, is a professor at Meijo University and distinguished professor at Nagoya University.

Amano, 54, is also a professor at Nagoya University, while the 60-year-old Nakamura is a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The laureates triggered a transformation of lighting technology when they produced bright blue light from semiconductors, something scientist had struggled with for decades, the Nobel committee said.

Using the blue light, LED lamps emitting white light could be created in a new way.

'As about one fourth of world electricity consumption is used for lighting purposes, the LEDs contribute to saving the Earth's resources,' the committee said. 

LED bulbs (pictured) last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs.They also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs.

'They succeeded where everyone else had failed,' the Nobel committee added. 

'Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th century; the 21st century will be lit by LED lamps.

They also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs. 

Professor Akasaki said in a nationally-televised news conference that he had often been told that his research wouldn't bear fruit within the 20th century.

'But I never felt that way,' he said. 'I was just doing what I wanted to do.' 

The benefits of increased efficiency could go far beyond home lighting, and the researchers are now looking at applications that extend from biomedicine to power electronics.

The University of Manchester, for instance, is planning to build tiny LED devices that can be implanted by keyhole surgery in cancer patients being treated with radiotherapy.

'If a patient moves while an X-ray or proton beam is directed at their tumour, then they risk healthy tissue being damaged,' explained Sir Colin Humphreys from the University of Cambridge.

'An LED attached to a sensor would detect movement at the site of the tumour in order to redirect the beam.' 

Last year's physics award went to Britain's Peter Higgs and Belgian colleague Francois Englert for helping to explain how matter formed after the Big Bang. 

Up to three Nobel laureates and two different works can be selected for the Nobel Prize in Physics.

Edinburgh-based Peter Higgs (pictured) and Belgian Francois Englebert won the prize last year

1903

Pierre and Marie Curie, French and Polish-French respectively, receive the prize along with Frenchman Antoine Henri Becquerel for their discovery and subsequent research of radioactivity.

1921

German-born Albert Einstein wins the award for his services to theoretical physics and his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect – which revealed metals emit electrons when light shines on them.

1932

German Werner Heisenberg receives the prize for discovering the principles of quantum mechanics, which we now know to govern the behaviour of subatomic particles.

1978

Americans Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson jointly receive the prize for discovering cosmic microwave background radiation – the thermal radiation left over in the universe from the Big Bang.

2013

Briton Peter Higgs and Belgian Francois Englebert scoop the prize for successfully predicting the existence of the Higgs boson particle – the 'God particle' found by Cern in 2012 that could explain why matter has mass.

Compared with other Nobel Prizes, some believe the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is much longer and far more rigorous.

Nobel Prize season began yesterday with the announcement of the 102nd Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine.

The prize is awarded for 'the most important discovery', rather than for a lifetime's portfolio of work by a researchers, doctor or scientist.

Yesterday's prize was given to John O'Keefe at University College London, and the Norwegian husband-and-wife team, Edvard and May-Britt Moser.

The team discovered cells in the brain that act as the body's internal global positioning system.

The Nobel Prizes will be handed out on December 10, which is also the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's (left) death in 1896. On the right is a list of the top ten most popular Nobel Laureates in Physics

Since these cells are among the first to be hit in Alzheimer's, understanding how they are degraded should shed important light on the disease process.

Four Nobel Laureates have been forced by authorities to decline the Nobel Prize.

Adolf Hitler told three German Nobel Laureates, Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt and Gerhard Domagk, that they could not accept their award. 

They all later received the Nobel Prize Diploma and Medal, but not the prize amount.

Boris Pasternak, the 1958 Nobel Laureate in Literature, initially accepted the Nobel Prize but was later coerced by the authorities of the Soviet Union to decline.

Winners must be alive, but they are not contacted until very shortly before the official announcement.

This rule proved problematic in 2011, when it was discovered that Canadian Ralph Steinman, had died of cancer four days before being told about his Nobel Prize.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be announced tomorrow, and the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.

This will be followed by the award of the Nobel peace prize on Friday and the Nobel Prize in economics will be announced on Monday.

Winners in all categories receive 8.0 million Swedish kronor this year – just over £690,000 or $1.1 million.

The Nobel Prizes will be handed out on December 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.

From 1901 to 2013, 876 have received Nobel Prizes including the likes of Marie Curie, Nelson Mandela and Ernest Hemingway.
