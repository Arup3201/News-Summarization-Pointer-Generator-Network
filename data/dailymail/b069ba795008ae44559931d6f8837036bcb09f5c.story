Both the Mormon doctor's mistress and 
his daughter who was only 6-years-old at the time of her mother's death 
have revealed more stunning details in Michele MacNeill's murder trial.

On
Tuesday, the court watched a 2008 videotaped police interview with the 
family's youngest daughter, Ada MacNeill, who found her mother in the 
bathtub after returning from school with her father.

She said her strongest memory was finding the bath water had turned brown.

'We found her in the tub,' Ada MacNeill told the investigator about 18 months after the death. 'She was still in clothes.'

On trial: Martin MacNeill remained stone-faced throughout the testimony on Tuesday (pictured) which included questions from his former mistress, her mother, his wife's sister and a taped interview of his daughter

Several times on the tape, she said she didn't want to talk about the day her mother died. She later expanded on her memories after investigators asked one of her sisters to question her.

The judge, however, ruled those accounts were tainted and defense lawyers declined to call the now-12-year-old girl into the courtroom for cross-examination.

'She doesn't have a credible memory to question,' Randy Spencer, one of Martin MacNeill's defense lawyers, later told reporters outside court. 'It's pointless to try.'

One woman who has spoken to the court at length is Gypsy Willis, the woman who MacNeill was having a sexual relationship with for more than a year before his wife's death.

On the stand: Gypsy Willis, who had an affair with a doctor accused of killing his wife, testifies on Tuesday, explaining that she moved into the couple's home just nine days after his wife's death

Counter intuitive: Willis said that her relationship with the doctor was 'casual' but then went on to say that she moved in with him and his family just eight days after his wife died

Willis conceded that a photo of her bare buttocks that she sent Martin MacNeill on April 12, 2007 - the day after his wife Michelle died - was a 'little bit suggestive'.

Then just eight days after the image was sent, Willis moved into the couple's home and three months later, she received a marriage proposal and a $7,000 diamond ring from MacNeill, she testified.

MacNeill is accused of hounding his wife to get a face-lift, then administering a lethal combination of drugs for her recovery and helping her into a tub of water in 2007.

Shortly after the death, in late June, MacNeill and Willis were looking for wedding rings online, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

Then during a trip to Wyoming in July, MacNeill proposed to Willis at a restaurant with a four-and-a-half carat diamond ring - but Willis claimed she could not remember the details of the proposal.

'It's been so long. This relationship has been over a very long time,' she said.

A mother's point of view: Vicki Willis, Gypsy's mom, told the court that MacNeill told her 'he never loved his wife' and went on to say he 'loved her like a sister... not like how I love Gypsy'

The judge allowed prosecutors to aggressively question Willis as a hostile witness after they argued she was trying to protect MacNeill with less than truthful answers.

'Are you telling us you don't know anything more about Michele's death?' prosecutor Sam Pead asked.

'That is correct,' Willis replied.

Willis' mother testified that the doctor tried to win over her family on visits to their home.

At a lavish engagement party in early July 2007 at a Cheyenne restaurant, MacNeill 'made a public show of dropping to a knee and asking her to marry him,' Vicki Willis said.

She recalled how he pulled her aside and said some disparaging things about his recently deceased wife.

'He said to me he never loved Michele... he amended that to say 'Well, I did, I loved her like a sister but never like I love Gypsy,'' she told the court on Tuesday.

In previous testimony, Willis said she made the married father-of-eight online in November 2005 and their affair became sexual the following January and continued for the 15 months before the death.

Willis, who called the relationship casual, said the doctor set her up in a duplex, gave her a debit card for 
expenses, and helped pay for her schooling as a nursing student.

On the day his wife died, she traded text messages with the doctor 30 times that day and later attended his wife's funeral - again, keeping in contact with him over texts.

She was previously asked about a family interview arranged by the doctor, who was looking for someone to care for his four youngest daughters.

'Was there any question you were going to be hired as a nanny?' prosecutor Chad Grunander asked.

Family: MacNeill, a former Mormon Sunday school teacher, and his wife Michelle had eight children

Accused: Prosecutors said he wanted to kill his wife so that he could continue his affair with Willis

Willis smiled before saying she understood that she needed the approval of MacNeill's grown children. Two have testified that they suspected she was a mistress and didn't want her in the house but were overruled by their father.

A drug expert testified last week that Michele MacNeill had four nervous system depressants in her blood that would have had a powerful knockout effect. A cause of death was never established.

Defense lawyers argue she had a heart attack and fell into the tub.

Willis was testifying under a deal with prosecutors that kept her out of jail on identity-theft charges. She was accused of taking the identity of one of MacNeill's adopted daughters to escape a debt-heavy credit history
