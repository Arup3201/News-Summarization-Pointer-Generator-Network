Swimmers at a beach in Massachusetts were forced to evacuate the water on Monday afternoon after a great white shark was spotted in the ocean 115 yards from the shore.

Massachusetts State Police announced on their Facebook page that a 12-14 foot shark was spotted in the waters of Duxbury Beach.

No injuries were reported during the evacuation but the Boston Globe reports that around 1,000 people were swimming in the water.

The Duxbury Fire Department reports that a police helicopter saw the shark in the water near the area of powder point Bride at around 2 p.m.

Police were able to track the shark as it swam to deeper water.

The Boston Globe writes that Duxbury Fire Chief Kevin Nord said two local harbormaster boats also surrounded the shark in an effort to force it out of the area.

CBS reports that one beachgoer tried to make light of the situation by writing 'you’re gonna need a bigger boat' from the movie Jaws in the sand.

The beach was closed for two hours on Monday afternoon.

Duxbury Beach is an unusual location for a shark sighting and Nord said that it was swimming 'too close for comfort.'

Nord said that the shark spotted on Monday was the largest shark he's seen all year.
