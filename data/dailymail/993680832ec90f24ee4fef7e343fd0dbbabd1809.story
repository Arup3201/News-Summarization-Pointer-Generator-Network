An armed robber has been jailed after ramming into a police car, before fleeing and setting fire to a stolen truck.

John Davis, 33, was caught on CCTV repeatedly crashing into the police vehicle after being blocked in at a street in Birmingham. 

He then set fire to the stolen Ford Ranger - escaping in another vehicle as the truck went up in flames.

Terrifying: John Davis, 33, is caught on CCTV repeatedly crashing into the police car in a street in Birmingham

Violent: He rams into the police vehicle nine days after committing an armed robbery in Solihull, West Midlands

Escape: Davis then flees the scene in a stolen Ford Ranger - leaving the police car in a damaged state

Fire: The robber later sets fire to the stolen truck - escaping in silver car as the vehicle goes up in flames

Now, he has been jailed for 17 years after also being convicted of an armed robbery that took place just nine days later. 

Davis, from Sparkhill, was one of three robbers who smashed their way into a home in Solihull, West Midlands on May 12, before demanding jewellery from the family. 

The trio hurled a brick through the rear
window of the house and then attacked a 50-year-old man - stabbing him in the arm and stomach and spraying him with pepper spray.

Jailed: Davis, from Sparkhill, has been sentenced to 17 years in jail at Birmingham Crown Court

They then hit him over the head with a brick, before demanding to be taken 'to the gold'.

However, a well-drilled ‘emergency plan’
− previously rehearsed by the family − saw Davis, Steven Moore and Andrew Quinn trapped in the kitchen by a locked door.

Meanwhile, a daughter, who hid
upstairs, triggered a panic alarm and dialled 999.

The robbers eventually managed to force the door open, before pocketing a handful of jewellery and making a dash to a waiting getaway car.

Police, who arrived at 
the house minutes after the alarm was raised, arrested Moore as he ran from the scene.

Davis and Quinn were 
picked up four days later following detailed mobile phone analysis.

Their getaway vehicle - a Renault Megane, which had been stolen during a previous burglary - was later discovered behind a timber yard in Tyseley.

Moore, 28, who had only just been released from an eight-year prison term, was jailed for 15 years - with a minimum of 11 years behind bars - after admitting robbery.

Quinn, also 28, denied being involved in the incident, but was found guilty at the end of a
five-day trial at Birmingham Crown Court last month.

Today, he was jailed for 17 years at the same court - with a minimum term of 15 years in prison. 

Crime: Davis, pictured after setting the Ford Ranger on fire, was one of three robbers who smashed their way into a home in Solihull, before demanding jewellery from the family

Horrific: The trio hurled a brick through the rear window of the house, before attacking a 50-year-old man

Attack: Davis and his accomplices Steven Moore and Andrew Quinn stabbed the man in the arm and stomach

Davis, who was jailed for the same period, was also found guilty of dangerous driving after ramming into the police car and setting fire to the stolen truck on May 3.

Solihull Police Detective Constable Dave Bailey, who led the investigation, said: 'These are dangerous men - individuals who had no qualms about putting a family, including two daughters aged 15 and 17, through a frightening ordeal.

'However, they picked on the wrong home because the switched-on family − who have owned jewellery shops for many years − had a pre-arranged emergency plan in place should their home ever be targeted by thieves.

Guilty: Moore, left, has been jailed for 15 years, while Quinn, right, has been sentenced to 17 years in prison

Case: The trio were all convicted of armed robbery at Birmingham Crown Court, pictured. Davis was also found guilty of dangerous driving after ramming into the police car and setting fire to the stolen truck on May 3

'It saw an early call to police, which meant the robbers fled largely empty-handed and meant we could get officers to the scene quickly - with one offender caught red-handed.

'The judge has rightly handed down lengthy sentences to these men and the region’s streets are now safer with them behind bars.'

He added: 'All three arrived at the house knowing they were going to use violence in order to steal.

'They are therefore all equally culpable for the victim’s stab injuries, from which he thankfully made a full recovery.'
