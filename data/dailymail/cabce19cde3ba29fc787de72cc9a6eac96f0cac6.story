Caught: Jerry Pocklington, 29, planned to hide with his stepdaughter until they could marry

A 29-year-old registered sex offender has been arrested after running away with his 14-year-old stepdaughter, with whom he started a sexual relationship a year ago.

Jerry Pocklington, who is still married to the girl's mother, allegedly told police that he had planned to run away with her to New York and keep her there for four years until she was old enough to legally wed.

But rather than heading north from their home in Litchfield, Illinois, they fled east on May 14 and hitchhiked to St Louis, Missouri before traveling to nearby Maryland Heights.

'While they were walking, they arrived at the rear of an 
area business, they found an unlocked van, they spent the night in the 
van Thursday evening,' Maryland Heights Detective Sgt. Rich 
White told KPLR.

'It was during that time that he committed the 
statutory rape against her.'

When they emerged the next morning, they were seen by employees who alerted police after thinking they looked suspicious.

When
 Maryland Heights police arrived, Pocklington tried to escape them but he was 
caught. His mug shot shows bruises to his face.

Pocklington is a registered sex offender in Arizona after committing a sex crime as a juvenile, records show.

Investigators interviewed him and his
 stepdaughter and established that they began a sexual relationship in 
July 2013, KPLR reported.

'I think she knew that it was wrong, but again,
 she's a 14 year-old child, so she was scared and confused,' White said.

'I'm not sure if he's delusional, I believe in his own mind that's who he's attracted to and he thinks he's in love with her, I guess.'

MailOnline
 is not identifying the girl, as she is a juvenile and the alleged 
victim of a sexual assault. She was reported missing when she failed to 
turn up for school, relatives wrote on Facebook.

She
 is now in the custody of a family member, although her mother wrote on 
her Facebook page that they had not yet been reunited.

Pocklington was charged in Missouri with two counts of 
statutory sodomy and one count of statutory rape, and was jailed in lieu 
of $150,000 cash-only bond.

If he is convicted, he could get at least 25 years in prison - but he could also face additional charges and prison time in Illinois.

Litchfield police told KPLR that they are investigating allegations that he raped her in the state and expect extra charges to be given this week.

He is set to appear in St Louise County Court on June 2.
