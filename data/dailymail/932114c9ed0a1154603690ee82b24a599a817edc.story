Dozens of babies have died after contracting meningitis while the Government has been haggling over the cost of a vaccine to prevent the disease.

British scientists recommended in March that the vaccine should be given routinely to all infants to protect them against meningitis B, which affects more than 600 people a year, but mostly those under the age of five.

But eight months on, despite the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending Bexsero, the Department of Health has not been able to agree a price with makers Novartis – with negotiations only beginning in August.

Last week David Cameron said he wanted to find a ‘cost-effective way’ of making the UK the first country in the world with a national meningococcal B vaccine.

But top doctors said the ‘unacceptable’ delay is costing lives – and that the death toll will accelerate over the winter.

According to the charity Meningitis Now, around 20 babies have died of meningitis B since March. The bacterial infection can cause septicaemia, which can be deadly and lead to limb loss. It can also cause brain damage.

Young children are most susceptible because their immune systems are not fully developed, although anyone can die from it. Around 400 people have been infected since the spring.

Dr Nelly Ninis, a paediatrician and clinical adviser to the Meningitis Research Foundation, feared Ministers were letting the ‘historic’ opportunity to all but eradicate the last major type of bacterial meningitis from Britain pass.

She said: ‘We have come to this historic moment, where we have a vaccine to protect against meningitis B, which now accounts for the lion’s share of cases. But now we are fudging it.’

Harmonie-Rose's family - including her parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen, pictured - said it was heartbreaking to know the young girl's suffering could have been spared through the licensed vaccine

Among the most recent victims of the disease is Harmonie-Rose Allen from Bath, who turns one this week.

In September her parents Freya Hall, 20, and Ross Allen, 22, celebrated her first steps.

But weeks later they were left devastated after being told by doctors at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children that she had contracted meningitis. It caused such extensive septicaemia that she had to have both her arms and legs amputated.

Harmonie-Rose’s aunt Hannah Hall, 31, said it was heartbreaking that a licensed vaccine existed which could have spared her such suffering.

Harmonie-Rose's case was mentioned in the House of Lords this week in a plea to David Cameron

She said: ‘The family feel like Harmonie-Rose’s whole life has been robbed. Had this vaccine been made publicly available there is a strong likelihood she would not be in this position.’

Conservative MP for The Cotswolds, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, brought up Harmonie-Rose’s case as he made his plea to Mr Cameron in the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday.

‘Thirty babies die of this [disease] a year. Much more worryingly, 300 babies are severely maimed,’ Mr Clifton-Brown said. ‘There is a licensed and safe vaccine available. The issue is cost.’

Mr Cameron replied: ‘I’m certainly keen to help if I can. But as [Mr Clifton-Brown] says, there are issues, which is why... we’re having discussions with the producer of this vaccine to see if we can find a cost-effective way of doing this.’

Bexsero was licensed in the UK 22 months ago. Studies show it is 95 per cent effective, after the recommended three doses.

At its NHS ‘list price’ of £75 a jab, it would cost £225 to give each child three doses, meaning the programme would cost £150 million annually. The JCVI said it should only be introduced if a cost-effective price is achieved.

However, it is understood Novartis has been willing to offer a substantial discount.

No one from Novartis was willing to comment last night.

However a Department of Health spokesman said that the ‘proper procurement rules’ had to be followed, and officials had been working through the process ‘as quickly as we can’.

He added: ‘We are continuing our negotiations to agree a cost-effective price.’
