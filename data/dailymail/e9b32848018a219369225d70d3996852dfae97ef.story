Even Stuart Lancaster’s tracksuit carried the marks of battle on Saturday evening. England’s head coach wound up with blood on his back. It belonged to Brad Barritt, whose selfless commitment embodied the gutsy nature of this vital victory.

In saving face, the home players were left with damage there too. Orders to use their heads clearly had been taken quite literally but the winners at Twickenham had also understood the message from their coaches to play smarter. The upshot was that a QBE series of stalled progress at least ended with a positive result against one of the mighty SANZAR teams.

All the cuts, bruises and assorted wounds spoke of fervent, gallant endeavour but relief was still visible on battered English features. Relief and perspective.

They knew this was a triumph for the here and now, to ease the pressure and dilute the torrent of recent criticism, without providing solutions to long-term conundrums.

At the heart of this resilient performance based on forward force was the captain, Chris Robshaw. On several occasions, the Harlequins flanker made the sort of breakdown interventions which have often been considered beyond his scope, to dig his side out of deep holes. His work over the ball against the Wallabies was magnificent.

Yet, for all his satisfaction about personal and collective deeds, the skipper was realistic in his post-match reflections. ‘Over the last two weeks we’ve probably simplified things a bit and it showed with the way we played,’ he said. ‘It still wasn’t as smooth as we’d like but it was smooth enough today.

‘We’re extremely pleased with our forward play. You look back at the history of English rugby and they have always had a good pack to go back to. But it’s about having more than that.

England head coach Lancaster looks on during the international at Twickenham on Saturday

93.9% - England won 93.9 per cent of their line-outs.

18 - England only made 18 off-loads in their four Tests. In their match against England alone, New Zealand made 15 off-loads.

64 - Tackles made by Chris Robshaw this autumn, the most for an England player.

91.3% - England’s average tackle success rate. Their lowest figure was 86 per cent against Australia.

225 - Metres run by Mike Brown, the most by any England player.

2 - England only lost two of 27 scrums on their own feed.

‘We know we’ve stuttered throughout the series. We know it’s not all smelling of roses and there are improvements to be made, but there’s a huge amount of relief to finish like that. We feel like we’ve got back to where we need to be but it is about going up another gear.’

A recurring question in the aftermath of this game was whether England have taken a step in the right direction this autumn. While coaches and players were keen to hint at marginal gains, the truth is that the team have not advanced - they are more or less where they were, with a wider base.

The positive news is that they have identified yet more players who can stay afloat in the choppy waters of Test rugby. George Ford has been the principal ‘find’ - in confirming his ability to run the show at No 10 - but others in that category are Anthony Watson and George Kruis.

Lancaster will take comfort from the expansion of the talent pool but sheer weight of numbers will not suffice. The urgent priorities now are to achieve selection stability, especially behind the scrum, and rediscover the attacking spark which characterised England’s play during the last Six Nations.

31 - Metres gained by No 8 Ben Morgan against Australia.

Only Mike Brown (58) and Anthony Watson (36) gained more ground for England.

It is quite understandable for the head coach to urge his players to come to his aid by performing well game after game at international and club level. That is the hallmark of the leading All Blacks, for instance, and a feat of consistency which English squad members continue to find elusive.

The likes of Owen Farrell, Danny Care and Billy Vunipola have dropped back in November and the coaches crave a spirited response.

What is in no doubt is the towering scale of England’s clout up front. As showcased in the scrum-led demolition of the Wallaby pack, Graham Rowntree has assembled and honed a formidable group of imposing forwards. Ben Morgan’s two tries were just reward for his fine carrying, while Courtney Lawes was a colossal influence, particularly in defence and Joe Marler had his best game of the autumn.

Rowntree conceded that he is facing a ‘good headache’ in the weeks ahead. Several casualties will be pushing for a recall, notably props Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole, locks Joe Launchbury and Geoff Parling, plus Tom Croft and the fit-but-misfiring Vunipola in the back row. They all have a mammoth task to gatecrash a dominant unit. England could just about field two packs to compete with the best in the world.

But the back line continues to frustrate and puzzle the coaches and outside observers alike. The selection wheel keeps turning, with midfield the perennial focal point. Ben Youngs and Ford should continue their half-back alliance in Cardiff - providing they stay fit - but Manu Tuilagi will surely storm back into the centre equation and Luther Burrell should be in the mix too.

A case could be made for those two being unleashed together, with Burrell at 12 and Tuilagi outside him. Billy Twelvetrees was told he could take a short-term grip on the inside centre position if he shone against Australia but he was unable to seize his chance. With Kyle Eastmond also tried and discarded, Sam Burgess will come into the reckoning, based on his ‘barn-storming’ potential to break tackles and off-load.

England’s wide attacking was made to look hesitant and wooden in comparison with the far more fluent Wallabies, who will come back to Twickenham on World Cup business next year armed with a multitude of threats.

However, the ghosts of their scrum nightmares have been resurrected and that could be a major benefit to Lancaster 10 months from now.

That is a deadly weapon but they need to develop more. Quickly.
