When coffee chain Starbucks opened the doors of its new shop in Aberystwyth, it must have thought its signs, translated into Welsh, would endear the company to visitors. Instead, it left them baffled.

One slogan painted on the wall in white script read: 'Nourishing the human spirit . . . one person, one cup and.' 

Elsewhere, the company said of its products: 'Light of body and taste our coffee to most easy to drink.'

One customer, Sharon Hughes, said: 'It's a nice gesture, but they have got it really wrong. Some of the translations are gobbledegook.'

Starbucks has apologised for the spelling mistakes and nonsense grammar, but Welsh language campaign groups have saluted the coffee chain.

Their view is that they would rather see 'slack Welsh than slick English' — even if that means swallowing a load of spelling mistakes along with your cappuccino.

The outlet in Upper Great Darkgate Street – the 21st to open in Wales – is the first to adopt Welsh as its first language, with menus, blackboards and even its walls seeing Welsh take precedence over English.

Last month, Simon Redfern, director communications, Starbucks Europe, told Wales Online: 'Despite checks on our Welsh language signage, a couple of typos have been spotted, we're going to correct these as soon as possible.'

He added: 'We try to create a warm welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy and this works best when we reflect the local culture and language in our store designs. We are really proud of our first dual-language menu board in Welsh and English in our Aberystwyth store.'

A spokeswoman added that there are employees in the Aberystwyth Starbucks team who speak Welsh.
