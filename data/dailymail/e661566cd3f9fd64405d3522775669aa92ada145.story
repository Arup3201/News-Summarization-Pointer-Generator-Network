As the saying goes, ‘nobody remembers who came second’, yet the past week of athletics at Hampden Park has shown this is clearly nonsense.

Two 20-year-old former world junior champions from England, Adam Gemili and Jodie Williams, brushed aside the might of the Caribbean to win silver in the sprints and immediately spoke of their first senior honours as ‘stepping stones’ to success. We will remember these names, all right.

In the first five days of athletics at the Commonwealth Games, England won 16 medals, including three golds. But best of all, 11 of those who stepped onto the podium at Hampden are 23 or under.

Delight: Kelly Holmes reckons the British success in Glasgow will get them going for gold in Rio

Many of these silver- and bronze-medal performances were significant breakthroughs for young athletes who seized their chances at a major competition. Others, such as British 200m champion Danny Talbot and Asha Philip in the 100m — both 23 — reached high-calibre finals, gaining valuable experience against some of the fastest athletes in the world and performing well on the biggest stage of their careers.

For long jump silver medallist Jazmin Sawyers, 21, Laura Samuel, 23, in the triple jump and wheelchair racer Jade Jones, 18, Commonwealth success has been an exciting surprise. Yet they too are not content to dwell on their achievements but recognise they can be a springboard to more.

Gemili said: ‘People have said that this Commonwealth Games is a great place to establish yourself, get that great championships experience and learn how to win medals at championships. Taking that forwards, I know we’ve got the Europeans in a couple of weeks’ time, and then the World Championships next year and eventually the Rio Olympics in 2016.

‘So it’s been great to learn how to win a medal and how to deal with the stress and the pressures of it and go out and win a medal on the day. It’s a great stepping stone.’

Better luck next time: Adam Gemili picked up the silver and will hope for even better in Rio in two years

Fighting against the best: Gemili came up against some of the best sprinters around at Hampden Park

Dame Kelly Holmes remembers sharing a room with Sally Gunnell, already a 400m hurdles world and Olympic champion, at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. Holmes was 24 and still a ‘soldier who ran a bit’ and marvelled at Gunnell taking cold showers after her races to aid her recovery. Yet Holmes won 800m gold there and went on to complete a remarkable middle-distance double at the Olympics in Athens 10 years later.

‘Without the Commonwealth Games there’s no chance I would have ever become a double Olympic champion,’ Holmes told the Evening Standard. ‘The Commonwealths have been an unbelievable springboard for me and many others.

‘It may still be two years to go until Rio de Janeiro but it’s effectively just around the corner for all these athletes. New star names are emerging here in Glasgow who will go on to become household names.’

Double trouble: Bianca and Jodie Williams celebrate their bronze and silver medals in the 200m final

England’s young team at Hampden could have been even stronger had it not been for injuries, the early selection deadline of June 1 or the clash with the World Junior Championships. The fastest female in Britain this year, Dina Asher-Smith, won world junior gold in Oregon, while heptathlete Morgan Lake, 17, achieved a heptathlon and high jump double after withdrawing from these Games.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who missed the Commonwealths with a foot injury, is still only 21 but leads the British rankings for heptathlon, high jump and long jump. Matthew Hudson-Smith, 19, is the quickest over 400m. Chijindu ‘CJ’ Ujah, the only man to break the 10-second barrier for 100m this season, has not been selected in the individual event at either the Commonwealths or European Championships.

Getting close: Danny Talbot came close against the Jamaicans in the 200m final and is looking promising

Greg Rutherford, who won long jump silver in Delhi aged 23 before going on to clinch the Olympic and Commonwealth titles, said: ‘That’s where I see the Commonwealth Games being of major importance, for younger guys or guys who grab that opportunity to break through and give it a go. It would have been great to see CJ here and, looking at the field, I think he really would have stepped up and had a good time. He is a different level of athlete.

‘Competing in front of a crowd like that really is something special and sadly it will be a little while before we get another British crowd at a major — the World Championships in London 2017, I guess — so hopefully he’ll be there. It will be a handy relay team as well, actually.’

Crucially, British athletes also now face significant competition from within.

Admin: Holmes is now President of Commonwealth Games England and has been working in Glasgow

Our women won 4x100m bronze at the World Championships last year, but the battle is now even more fierce for those four relay places, with the nation’s young guns now believing they can take on the Americans and Jamaicans.

Bianca Williams, 21, who won Commonwealth 200m bronze and came sixth in the 100m final, agreed: ‘Definitely — there are loads of us coming up and we’re all upping our game because we all know next year at the World Championships we’re all going to be on the podium.

‘We’ll all be in the final chasing those Americans and Jamaicans down. We know we can do it.’

Williams said those words just minutes after winning her first senior medal. The Commonwealth Games are not over yet but we are already looking forward to the successes they could spark for this exciting, hungry young group of athletes.

Close but no cigar...what about in Rio? Asha Philip is another showing potential - in the women's 100m
