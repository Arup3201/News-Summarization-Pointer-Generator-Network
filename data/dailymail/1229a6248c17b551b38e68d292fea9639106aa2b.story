None of the 157 Tamil asylum seekers who've been detained at sea for four weeks will ever call Australia home, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said.

This is part of a new asylum-seeker deal where about two-thirds of the 157 passengers could be sent back to India.

Mr Morrison vowed the passengers who do not return to their country of origin would be sent to Nauru or Manus Island, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Scott Morrison has confirmed that a border protection vessel holding 157 asylum seekers will be brought to Australia

The Australian vessel carrying the asylum seekers is on its way to Australian shores, making it the first asylum seeker vessel to land in Australia since the government introduced its hardline Stop The Boats campaign.

Mr Morrison confirmed on Friday that the vessel would be brought to Australia so that the identify and origin of passengers could be determined.

He said the decision to allow the vessel to land did not reflect any change in the government's policy and that there had been 'no broken promise'.

'It is the policy of the government and of Operation Sovereign Border not to resettle people in Australia.

'There is no change to our policy in anyway, there is no change to our resolve.'

He said that bringing the asylum seekers to Australia was simply the 'most effective, safest, and most convenient method' of dealing with those on board the vessel.

When asked whether this decision marked a failure of the government's 'stop the boats' promise before the September 2013 election, he stated that he had never promised that the boats would stop entirely, but that they would reduce the number of boats arriving to the levels experienced during the Howard government.

It is believed the boat left Pondicherry in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu on June 11 and was intercepted by Australian border patrol on 29 June.

It is believed the asylum seekers will be taken to Curtin Detention Centre in Western Australia

Those on board the vessel include 37 children, it is not clear what condition they have been kept in while detained, though Guardian Australia has reported they have been locked for 21 hours a day in windowless rooms, sleeping in bunks stacked four high.

A High Court case is trying to establish whether the detention of the asylum seekers on board the vessel, is legal under the Maritime Powers Act.

Mr Morrison said that once the asylum seekers arrive in Australia, Indian officials will be granted consular access, and the Indian government has agreed to accept Indian citizens and some Sri Lankan nationals back into the country.

The minister would not confirm what would happen to any asylum seekers on board the vessel who were not found to be Indian or Sri Lankan nationals, but stated categorically that 'they will not be resettled [in Australia].'

Mr Morrison would not confirm the destination of the border protection vessel, but Guardian Australia reported it is currently on its way to the Australian territory of the Cocos Islands, off the north-west coast of Australia.

Government sources interviewed by the Guardian said that asylum seekers will land on the Cocos Islands on Saturday before being taken to Curtin detention centre in Western Australia.
