This is Gold Base, the secret desert HQ of the Scientology Church and the controversial Sea Org group, reportedly central to Katie Holmes’s marital split from Tom Cruise.

Ominously for those inside, the razor-sharp fences surrounding the 700-acre compound of Gold Base have spikes pointing in both directions.

With motion sensors along the perimeter and a camouflaged sniper bunker hidden in the hillside above, it is unclear whether the prison-style security is to keep people out or to keep them in — or both. The base, surrounded by hills near the town of Hemet in southern California, was for decades a secret even to most Scientologists.

But now it has been thrust into the spotlight amid claims that Holmes ended her six-year-marriage to the Mission Impossible star over fears that he wanted to send their daughter Suri to join Sea Org.

Although Suri is only six and Sea 
Org  usually recruits young people over 16, Cruise — yesterday named the
 highest-paid Hollywood star after earning £47 million last year — holds
 enormous sway in the church and would have no problem pulling strings.

But Sea Org’s dire reputation is 
enough to give any mother palpitations. Its members wear naval uniforms,
 use military ranks and are expected to salute to senior church members 
like Cruise and call them ‘sir’.

Outraged former members say that 
conditions are anything but fraternal and have painted Sea Org — which 
stands for Sea Organisation, a reference to the church’s early days 
sailing the globe on ships — as slavery by another name.

Some 800 of the 6,000 Sea Org members are at Gold Base at any given time, but all of them can expect 
to spend some of their toughest years in the church there.

Formerly a resort popular with the 
Hollywood industry and known by the unfortunate title of Massacre 
Canyon after an old Indian tribal battle, Gold Base was bought by the 
church in 1978. It has since spent at least £30 million redeveloping it.

The site boasts comfortable villas 
where the group’s authoritarian leader David Miscavige and other senior 
Scientologists live and work, a castle-style film studio that  produces 
propaganda, a huge church, a ship-themed swimming pool, a golf course 
and the mansion of the late Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard.

The latter, the grand house at the 
top of the compound called Bonnie View, is now a museum but is 
reportedly kept fully staffed and furnished. Scientologists believe in 
reincarnation, and hope Hubbard may some day return.

Ex-Sea Org members claim  they were continually forced to work 20-hour days for just room, board and a weekly allowance of £15.

Physical relationships, marriage and 
especially childbirth are said to be discouraged as they are seen as a 
distraction from Sea Org’s arduous work running the Scientology 
organisation.

Recruits sign billion-year contracts 
because — as Scientologists believe in reincarnation — they are expected
 to return to Sea Org in future lives.

When they have tried to leave, some 
Sea Orgers — as members are called — have said the church has given them
 a bill for tens of thousands of dollars for the teaching and training 
they received while serving in Sea Org.

Church leaders at Gold Base are 
allegedly encouraged to instil  aggressive, even violent discipline on 
the compound both with Sea Org foot soldiers and other visiting church 
members.

Those who fail to submit are 
reportedly punished in ‘the Hole’, a pair of extra-wide mobile homes on 
Gold Base used as a prison block for Scientologists who have in some way
 offended their leaders.

Although the church denies the 
existence of such a place and some believe the buildings have been 
removed, a string of former Scientologists have come forward to detail 
the abuse they allege went on there.

Mark ‘Marty’ Rathbun, once the  
second most powerful figure in the church — but who later fell out with 
the organisation and fled from the base — told a court that between 80 
and 100 Scientologists were  sentenced to the Hole at a time and were 
required to do group confessions all day and all night.

He claimed that, one night,  
Miscavige visited the Hole and organised a brutal game of musical 
chairs. Putting the Queen song Bohemian Rhapsody on the sound system, he
 announced that only the winner would be allowed to remain a member of 
the church, prompting a desperate fight as Scientologists came to blows 
over the chairs.

The church has denied all allegations, saying that Rathbun was ‘delusional’.

Earlier this year, another high- 
profile Scientologist defector,  Debbie Cook, tearfully told a court how
 in 2007 she and fellow ‘Holees’ at Gold Base — including church 
management from as far afield as France and Australia — were forced to 
share a single conference room with cubicles and office spaces around 
it.

There were bars on the windows and the only exit was guarded 24 hours a day by church security men, she said.

Meals were a ‘slop’ of reheated  
leftovers, such as beans and rice, barely providing enough energy for 
the days’ main activity — hurling abuse at each other in often violent 
confessionals designed to get them to admit ill-feeling towards 
Miscavige.

She described her own 12-hour ordeal 
as she was forced to stand in a large rubbish bin while the 100 other 
inmates poured water over her and screamed in her face that she was a 
lesbian.

‘You ate there, you slept there on 
the floor and you never left with the exception of a brief period to go 
take a shower,’ she said, adding that the place was infested with ants.

At one point, Miscavige is said to 
have piled on the discomfort by turning off the electricity — and 
therefore the air-conditioning — for two weeks, making the temperature 
inside the Hole soar to 106F (41C).

Rank-and-file Sea Org members  toiling away at Gold Base are similarly vulnerable to abuse, some of them claim.

Marc Headley, who spent 15 years in 
Sea Org, recounted how under- performers at Gold Base were  frequently 
sent to work-camps, where they would be humiliated.

He recounted how he and many  others 
once had to spend several days in the blistering desert heat chipping 
out several feet of solidified waste from a dried-out sewage lake.

They were allowed only hand tools and given neither masks nor eye protection.
