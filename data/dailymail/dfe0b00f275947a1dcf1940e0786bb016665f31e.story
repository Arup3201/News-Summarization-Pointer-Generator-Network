Offering tests to men in their late forties could reduce prostate cancer deaths by half, say experts.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening is used to detect prostate cancer, but remains controversial, because it became widespread long before there was substantial evidence to prove its value.

It can also be unreliable, giving false positive results which can cause anxiety and result in unnecessary treatment.

Prostate cancer can be a source of anxiety for middle aged and older men

Until now, the most recent study found that prostate cancer screening  reduced deaths by 20 per cent.

But, with this came a high rates of unnecessary treatment. Statistics showed that to save one life, nearly 50 cases needed to be treated.

In 2010, when the UK National Screening Committee in England last 
reviewed medical data, it decided that a national screening programme should not be introduced.

But now Swedish research, published in the BMJ, has found that if screening was offered to men aged between 45 and 49, it would predict nearly half of all cases.

Researchers reviewed a study carried out between 1974 and 1984 involving 21,277 Swedish men aged between 27 and 52.

All the men had donated blood samples at the start of the study. The researchers used these stored samples to run PSA tests.

They then checked to see if the PSA reading predicted whether or not they developed prostate cancer.

The researchers then used these results to work out the best age at which men should be screened.

They found that screening under the age of 45 detected too few deadly cancers.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK

More than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year.

Symptoms include a difficulty passing urine, a desire to frequently pass urine or needing to rush to the toilet.

PSA is a protein produced by both normal and cancerous prostate cells

But a high level of PSA can be a sign of cancer

A PSA reading higher than four, but less than 10 is usually due to a benign enlarged prostate

A reading higher than 10 may also just be a a symptoms of benign prostate disease

The higher the level of PSA, the more likely it is to be cancer

And delaying screening until after age 50 missed too many.

Screening between the ages of 45 and 49 spotted 44 per cent of the cancers that became deadly.

In the study, 1,369 of the men had prostate cancer, 241 had advanced disease and 162 died from it.

The study stated that all men should be offered a PSA test in their mid-to-late 40s.

They advised that those with a high PSA reading should return for surveillance, checks and treatment if necessary.

Those with normal results could wait another five to ten years for their next PSA test.

The study said: ‘At least half of all men can be identified as being at low risk and probably need no more than three PSA tests in a lifetime.'

'This is likely to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis while still enabling early cancer detection among those most likely to gain from early diagnosis,' they say.

Public Health England review evidence for screening every three years to ensure that the programmes offered by the NHS are based on the most up-to-date information available.

Prostate Cancer UK said more research efforts should be channelled into finding a better screening test for the disease.
