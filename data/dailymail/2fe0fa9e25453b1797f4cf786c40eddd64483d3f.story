A convicted cop killer could be released from jail after 19 years because of 'deeply flawed forensic evidence' leading to a substantial miscarriage of justice at his trial, an inquiry has found.

David Eastman was convicted in 1995 for the murder of federal police assistant commissioner Colin Winchester, who was shot twice at close range as he moved to get out of his Ford car on his neighbour’s driveway in Canberra, in 1989.

The man in charge of the six-month inquiry, former Northern Territory chief justice Brian Martin, says Mr Eastman did not receive a fair trial and was denied a fair chance of acquittal.

A retrial, almost two decades after Mr Eastman was jailed, is no longer possible because so many of the original witnesses have died since the crime was committed.

And so, in an extraordinary twist, it has been recommended that Mr Eastman be freed.

'The verdict was reached in circumstances where significant material was not disclosed by the prosecution, critical evidence was seriously flawed, evidence of a threat to kill was not properly tested,' Justice Martin says in a 477-page report released on Friday.

The Australian Federal Police tried to stop the report being released on Friday but failed.

Overturned: His conviction was quashed because there was a substantial miscarriage of justice at his trial

'For these reasons I recommend that the conviction of the applicant on November 3, 1995, for the murder of the deceased be quashed,' Justice Martin concluded.

Despite finding many problems with the trial, Justice Martin believes Mr Eastman, an angry sacked public servant, committed the crime.

'I am fairly certain that the applicant is guilty of the murder of the deceased, but a nagging doubt remains,' he says.

However, the substantial miscarriage of justice should not be allowed to stand uncorrected, he says.

Mr Winchester was shot dead on a summer's evening by his Canberra home in January 1989, a hit initially blamed on Italian organised crime figures he had been investigating.

But it was a former treasury official, David Eastman, who had threatened Mr Winchester weeks before the murder, who faced trial.

He was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The trial was marked by constant disruptions as Mr Eastman, a colourful and erratic character, sacked and rehired lawyers, sought adjournments and abused the judge and his own legal team.

The prosecution case was circumstantial.

Crucial evidence related to tiny particles of gunshot residue from the boot of Mr Eastman's car, which Victoria Police forensic scientist Robert Barnes testified was consistent with those found at the murder scene.

Justice Martin found Mr Barnes' gunshot evidence lacked proper scientific basis.

The funeral: Mr Winchester is the highest ranking police officer ever to be shot in Australia

'Unknown to the defence, Mr Barnes, who gave critical evidence connecting the applicant's car to the scene of the murder, was far from independent and objective. He regarded himself as a police witness and was biased accordingly,' his report says.

Mr Eastman's guilt was determined on the basis of deeply flawed forensic evidence, Justice Martin said.

It's now up to the ACT Supreme Court to decide whether or not to order Mr Eastman's freedom, 19 years after he was locked up.

Mr Winchester remains the highest ranking police officer ever to be shot in Australia.
