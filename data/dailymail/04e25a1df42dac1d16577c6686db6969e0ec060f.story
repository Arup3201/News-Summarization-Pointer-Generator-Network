Liverpool legend and darts fan Jan Molby came out on top in shootout against five-time World Champion Eric Bristow.

The 51-year-old former Denmark midfielder, who made over 200 appearances in a 12-year career at Anfield, went on the oche for a charity match at the Echo Arena in Liverpool.

The best-of-three leg match was televised live by TV3, the Danish broadcaster under the Viasat banner who screen PDC tournaments, with a £5,000 donation on offer to the winner's charity.

Despite being a rookie on the big darts stage, Molby won the game's opening leg with a double four before Bristow hit back to level by landing double top.

The deciding leg saw Bristow unable to finish 134, and Molby stepped in with a 95 checkout by hitting treble 19, a double three - when aiming for double 19 - and double 16. 

Molby claimed a £5,000 donation for Radio City's Cash For Kids charity.
