It’s an impressive list of items - an original Harry Potter wand, breast implants, a bucket of live crabs, a pet python, a £10,000 Tiffany engagement ring and a set of four Power Rangers costumes.

And all of them were left behind in Travelodge hotels last year, along with a winning EuroMillions ticket, a £50,000 Rolex watch, an 8ft pop-up spray tanning booth - and even a pantomime horse.

More than 20,000 books were left behind in the budget chain’s 38,000 rooms - a third of which were Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James - and 200 Queen Elizabeth masks were found at a Windsor hotel.

The most common items left behind in Travelodge’s 527 hotels included phone or laptop chargers, clothes, teddy bears, toiletry bags, books, laptops or tablets, satnavs, mobile phones and suitcases.

In the past year the hotel’s staff have reunited 76,500 forgotten cuddly bears with their owners, while other people left behind Bugatti keys, a stamp album worth £250,000 and London 2012 tickets.

Also left behind were a trunk of Cadbury chocolate, a diamond-encrusted wedding ring, a Persian Chinchilla kitten, a suitcase of vinyl records, a pilot’s training manual and Joseph’s Dreamcoat.

Other items were a pilot’s training manual, food processors, a spare car wheel, a box of old Liverpool FC match programmes, a script for a well-known TV soap and even a Wonder Woman outfit.

‘Our lost and found departments provide plenty of revelations,’ a Travelodge spokesman said. ‘Our customers’ left-behinds demonstrate what a cross section of people stay in our 527 hotels.

‘What is becoming evident after speaking to customers is that the pace of life has become so fast and we are so eager to get from A to B that priceless processions are easily being forgotten.’

The next most popular books left behind after Fifty Shades Of Grey were The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, along with the same author’s hit The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets’ Nest.

Fifty Shades Freed by Ms James was in fourth, ahead of Fifty Shades Darker in seventh. Fifth and sixth were The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and Mr Larsson’s The Girl Who Played With Fire.

Some of the stories behind the lost items have been retold by staff - such as the Chinese tourist who left behind the trunk of chocolate in a Birmingham hotel after a trip to Cadbury World.

The live crabs were left in a Brighton hotel by a guest staying over the night before a fish festival, and the python was left in Bristol by an owner who had given it the apt name of Monty.

The pantomime horse was left in Leeds by a Cinderella actor, and a diamond-incrusted iPhone 5 was left in London by a customer who had bought the phone on the day it launched. On finding the device, she had 228 missed calls.

The breast implants were left in a Newcastle hotel by a guest who was en-route to London for a cosmetic operation, and she had purchased them from the U.S.

The Harry Potter wand, used in the films, had been left in a Scunthorpe hotel and was worth in excess of £2,000. It was locked away in a drawer until the owner could come back to collect it.

The value of the EuroMillions ticket was not revealed. It was left in Watford by an owner who knew he had won - but left it under his mattress.

Since January 2012 all items left behind at Travelodge hotels that have not been claimed within three months have been donated to Cancer Research UK charity shops across the UK.
