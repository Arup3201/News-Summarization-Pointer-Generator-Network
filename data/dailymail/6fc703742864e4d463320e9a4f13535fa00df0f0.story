A baby boy had his life saved hundreds of times by hospital staff during the first 13 weeks of his life.

Born 14 weeks early, Dominic Willis had a severe form of apnoea of prematurity which caused him to stop breathing as often as six times every day.

His parents Roy Willis, 32, and Rachel Thompson, 26, from Billingham, County Durham, had to watch nurses desperately try to restart his breathing every time.

Dominic Willis was born 14 weeks early and developed a severe form of apnoea of prematurity which caused him to stop breathing up to six times every day. But now the nine-month-old is a happy, healthy baby and doctors have confirmed that he has grown out of the condition

Now, Dominic is nine-months-old and is a happy, healthy baby and doctors have confirmed that he has grown out of the condition. 

Support worker Mr Willis said: ‘To me, as soon as it happened I was preparing for doctors to tell me he wasn’t going to wake up the next time.

‘Every day I woke up thinking: “This could be the day”, it felt like a time bomb ready to go off and destroy my world.

‘I could feel it in the pit of my stomach and I never really allowed myself to believe that he would survive.

Apnoea of prematurity occurs when the central nervous system is not yet mature enough to allow non-stop breathing. Baby Dominic had to wear a special breathing device to make sure he had a constant supply of oxygen
This causes large bursts of breath followed by periods of shallow breathing or no breathing.
Dominic¿s condition was particularly severe and the apnoeas were more common and longer than in other cases.

Apnoea of prematurity is when automatic breathing suddenly stops.

It tends to occur in premature babies and occurs because the baby’s central nervous system is not fully developed when they are born.

Most babies can be roused from an apnoea episode simply by tapping or rubbing them to make them more alert, and most grow out of the condition as their body grows and develops.

Although apnoea usually resolves itself by the time most premature babies go home, a few will continue to have episodes.

In these cases, the baby will be discharged from the intensive care with an apnoea monitor.

The child may also need to take caffeine medication for a short time.

‘He had an apnoea at least twice a day, and up to six times a day, for 13 weeks. There wasn’t a day that went by that he didn’t stop breathing.

‘The staff stopped our son from dying over and over again. Nothing we can do will ever be enough to say thank you.’

Ms Thompson went into labour with Dominic 14 weeks before her due date. He was born at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital.

Nail technician Ms Thompson said: 
‘The first few weeks were a blur, we tried remain positive and did not 
speak of what could happen to Dominic.

‘We went to the hospital every day but I was only allowed to hold him once or twice a week.

‘We sat by the incubator, tortured that we could see him but not hold him.

Dominic's mother, Rachel Thompson (pictured with partner Roy Willis), said: ¿The first few weeks were a blur, we tried remain positive and did not speak of what could happen to Dominic. We went to the hospital every day but I was only allowed to hold him once or twice a week'

Mother Rachel (pictured) added: 'To me it was like he hadn¿t been born yet. Instead of being in my womb, he was in the incubator and that would look after him until he was ready to be born properly¿

‘At first the apnoeas were very scary, but we did start to get used to them.

‘To me it was like he hadn’t been born yet. Instead of being in my womb, he was in the incubator and that would look after him until he was ready to be born properly.’

Dominic’s worst apnoea occurred during one of the parents’ visits to the hospital.

Mr Willis said: ‘He was in Rachel’s arms when he stopped breathing and the monitors went mad.

‘I watched him go more and more blue.

‘The first step is to shake him a bit and rub him gently to see if that gets him going. Then they tilted his head back.

‘After that they tried that they had to put him on oxygen. It goes through a mask over his face.

‘We
had to stand and watch as they worked on our baby. They were trying 
everything. I was thinking my baby boy was leaving us right then.

‘I don’t know how they managed to pull him through but they did.’

It was 13 weeks before the couple were allowed to take Dominic home.

They are now fundraising for a new incubator for the hospital that cared for Dominic.
