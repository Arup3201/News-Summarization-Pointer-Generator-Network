From the terrifying Bird Dung Spider to a delicate Mirror Spider whose abdomen glitters like a disco ball, a photographer has got up close and personal with arachnids living on Singapore’s 64 islands to capture them in all their Technicolor glory.

Nicky Bay used macro photography to make sure every tiny detail of the mini beasts were documented from the astoundingly long horns of the Long Horned Orb Weaver to the menacing jaws of the Ant Mimic Jumping Spider and mesmerising almost human-like eyes of the Net-Casting Ogre Spider that weaves a web between its front legs to throw at unsuspecting prey.

While some people might be afraid by these arachnids, Mr Bay's photos show the incredible tactics used by spiders to hide and hunt as well as stand out and mimic less-tasty insects.

The Mirror Spider is a member of theTheridiidae family and has shiny, reflective patches  on its abdomen that might be composed of guanine crystals, which have been found to be a source of colour on some  spiders' bodies

The Mirror Spider lives in Singapore and the silvery tiles on its abdomen expand to make its body appear completely silver when it is at rest (pictured) and apparently shrink when it is on the move or scared, according to the photographer

Singapore is known for being an urban jungle, but its tropical climate is also home to a host of species of spiders and insects that thrive in the warm and moist environment.

Writing on his blog, Mr Bay said: 'Every year, I make a few trips to the 
tropical rainforests in the region as they certainly have a different 
diversity of critters compared to the local ones.'

He started photographing spiders in the summer of 2008 after getting his first high-end camera - a Nikon D80 and a macro lens, the Tamron 90mm.

While he subsequently upgraded to a better lens he mixes up his set-up but has now reverted to using his first lens around 99 per cent of the time.

The Bird Dung Spider looks like a bird dropping by day but by night, it constructs a large silk structure, lined with sticky droplets, to catch prey

It has an armoured abdomen and under UV light glows a brilliant blue

Mr Bay almost always uses a handheld set-up to get close to the spiders, but switches to using a tripod for specific subjects.

He said: 'Shooting handheld allows me to keep more than 3
 times as many shots as I would normally have if I shot on a tripod...as there is no perfect macro setup, I change my 
flash setup every now and then.'

He has studied the movement and markings of the Mirror Spider, a member of the Theridiidae family, which has shiny, reflective patches on its abdomen, which might be composed of guanine crystals, that have been found to be a source of colour on some spiders' bodies, Colossal reported.

As its name suggests he Ladybird Mimic deliberately looks like the spotty insect in a bid to make predators believe that it also tastes foul

The Ant Mimic Jumping Spider looks like a red weaver ant and has a slimmer abdomen than most spiders. It also has a fake 'waist' so that it looks like it has three parts (tagmata) of its body like a real ant and waves its front pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant's antennae

They are commonly known in Singapore 
as 'sequined' spiders and Mr Bay has noted that the sliver tiles on the 
spider's abdomen appear to shrink when it is scared or angry to show its
 'real' body.

The reflective tiles expand to make its body appear completely silver when it 
is at rest and apparently shrink when it is on the move, he said.

Mr Bay has photographed a number of spiders that mimic other insects and features of their local habitat.

The Bird
 Dung Spider looks like a bird dropping by day but by night, the arachnid
constructs a large silk structure lined with sticky droplets, to catch 
prey.

It has an armoured abdomen and under UV light glows a brilliant blue.

The Eight-Spotted Crab Spider looks a little crab-like and is bright yellow to deter predators

The terrifying Tree Stump Orb Weaver is well camouflaged by appearing as an extension of a tree stump. The creature apparently draws its legs up beneath it and covers its face to look more stump-like when it is frightened

As its name suggests, the Ladybird Mimic
 deliberately looks like the spotty insect in a bid to make predators 
believe it also tastes foul.

The Ant Mimic Jumping spider looks like a Red Weaver ant and has a slimmer abdomen than most spiders.

It
 also has a fake 'waist' so that it looks like it has three parts 
(tagmata) of its body like a real ant.

The spider even waves its front 
pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant's antennae, which has 
the added bonus of making it look like it has six legs.

The
 spiders have evolved patches of colour around one of their pairs of 
eyes, which makes them look like they have two compound eyes, rather than 
eight simple eyes like most other spiders.

Their bodies are covered with tiny reflective hairs so they look like the shiny bodies of ants.

The Long Horned Orb Weaver has strikingly long horns, although its is not known why they have evolved this way

The Net-Casting Ogre-Face Spider has front-facing, almost human-esque eyes, but while she might look relatively friendly, the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs and throws it at prey

Ant-mimicking
 spiders can behave more like ants than spiders too by moving in a 
zig-zag pattern and contrary to their name, Ant Mimic Jumping spiders 
actually avoid jumping so not to blow their cover.

Biologists
 believe they go to such lengths in a bid to avoid being eaten by 
predators who hunt by sight, including birds, lizards and larger 
spiders.

However, the spiders themselves prey on real ants and aphids.

The
 Eight-Spotted Crab spider looks a little crab-like but is a bright yellow colour to deter predators.

By contrast, the terrifying Tree Stump Orb Weaver is well camouflaged by appearing as an extension of a tree stump.

The creature apparently draws its legs up beneath it and covers its face to look more stump-like when it is frightened.

The Long Horned Orb Weaver has strikingly long horns, although its is not known why they have evolved this way.

Mr Bay almost always uses a handheld set-up with his camera equipped with a macro lens and home-made lighting to get close to the spiders and other insects (pictured), but switches to using a tripod for specific subjects

His detailed photographic method can capture tiny creatures such as these Wide-Jawed Viciria Spiderlings that have neon yellow bodies

The Net-Casting Ogre-Face Spider has front-facing, almost human-esque eyes.

While it might seem at first-glance that the spider only has two eyes, its four smaller ones are positioned very close by.

But while she might look relatively friendly, the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs.

Once the trap is set, she waits for prey and then hurls the net, and herself at it in a terrifying attack.

The spider belongs to the Deinopidae family, which stretches their webs and releases them to trap prey- but most of the family does not actively move the web once they are in place.
