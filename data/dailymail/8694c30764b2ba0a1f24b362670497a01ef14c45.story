The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met military supporters at Kensington Palace today to mark London Poppy Day, before a surprise trip down to High Street Kensington to greet volunteer flower vendors.

The royal couple hopped on a red 1960s Routemaster for the short trip from the palace to the tube station, where they chatted to some of the servicemen and women who are selling poppies today across the capital.

As ever, Kate dressed appropriately for the occasion, wearing a long, fitted claret coat with black tights and court shoes to match the colours of the Remembrance Day poppies. All she lacked was a flash of green to echo the flower's stalk.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled from Kensington palace to High Street Kensington this morning

Kate wore an outfit which matched the colours of the Remebrance Day poppies: her claret coat is from LK Bennett's autumn/winter 2011 collection

Kate's elegant calf-length coat, which she's worn on
 many previous occasions, is from LK Bennett's autumn winter 2011 
collection. The 'Ami' features a high collar, epaulets, and a 
waist-clinching belt - all the better to show off that already-svelte 
middle.

One surprised commuter says: 'Smiling
 and laughing, Kate and William looked completely at ease as they made 
their way into High Street Kensington Station as shocked bystanders - 
including me! - started snapping away on their iphones.'

'The energy was great! Everyone was 
so excited to see the couple in the flesh. Kate was even more glossy in 
real life - her hair looked super shiny and her style as polished as 
ever in a form-fitting red coat with a waist belt showing off her 
figure.â€™

The royal couple were meeting staff and 
volunteers taking part in the Royal British Legion appeal, who called in
 at the palace grounds as part of a tour across the capital on a 1960s 
Routemaster Bus.

Some 2,000
 uniformed personnel, veterans and their supporters are hitting the city's 
streets today for the eighth annual event ahead of Remembrance Day to 
commemorate the end of the First World War in 1918.

The Duchess of Cambridge met members of the Poppy Girls, daughters of military personnel who are releasing a charity song in aid of the British Royal Legion, today at Kensington Palace

The Duchess meets The Poppy Girls; Megan Adams, 10, Florence Ransom, 10, Alice Milburn, 13, Bethany Davey, 15, and Charlotte Mellor, 17, who beat 1,000 hopefuls to make it into the group.
