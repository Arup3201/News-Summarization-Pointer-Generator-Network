David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in the first three Star Wars films, said his dementia would now let him down and would probably forget his lines

Former Darth Vader actor David Prowse has said he would loved to have been involved in the new Star Wars movie, but fears his dementia would let him down. 

An 88-second sneak preview for the new film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, was released online yesterday and has already been viewed more than 15million times. 

But Mr Prowse, who played Lord Vader from 1977 to 1983, said he was disappointed he will not be able to play any part in the latest movie. 

The 79-year-old, who lives in Croydon, South London, told the Daily Mirror: 'It wouldn't have mattered what it was, I would have loved to have done something in it - even if it was just a cameo.'

Diagnosed with dementia this summer, he began taking medication in recent weeks.

'Sometimes I can't remember things I did yesterday. That worries me more than not remembering something 20 years ago.'

Mr Prowse, who appeared in Star Wars, the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, added: 'Now I would probably forget my lines.' 

In the films, his voice was over-dubbed by actor James Earl James and the fight scenes were done by British Olympic swordsman Bob Anderson.

Despite his Star Wars setback, Mr Prowse has come out of retirement to play safety superhero the Green Cross Code Man .

In the role, he will reinforce the mantra he drummed through the 1970s and 1980s: 'Stop, look, listen, think.' 

Mr Prowse, a married father of three who is also celebrated for his role as Darth Vader in Star Wars, was made an MBE by the Queen in 2000 for his contribution to road safety. Deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign, sponsored by the Department of Transport, which began in 1971.

Now it is hoped the online 21st century version, sponsored by MORE TH>N insurance, will have similar benefits for grown-ups.

The actor revealed he still owns his trusty Droid, a small robot that helped him underline the original road safety message. 

Elsewhere he has made a comeback as the Green Cross Man after 40 years for a new safety campaign

The Force Awakens is the seventh film in the Star Wars franchise and the first of a new trilogy of sequels.

The film, which reunites original stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is scheduled to be released in cinemas on 18 December 2015.  

The new film is set 30 years after the end of Episode VI, Return of the Jedi. 

It brings back original Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia, which is sure to please some life-long fans of the films
