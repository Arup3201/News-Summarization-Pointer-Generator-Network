Pictures have emerged of a smiling police commissioner posing with the two condemned Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, on their plane before take off on the two hour flight to the executions on Indonesia's 'death island'.

Djoko Hariutomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar placed his hand on Andrew Chan's shoulder and smiled for the camera, and then appeared in a second photograph with his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer.

The Bali Nine duo were then taken on a two hour flight to the port town of Cilacap and transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms.

The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five  drug smugglers.

Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight to 'death island'

Last place on earth: This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells

 

This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time  on Sunday, January 18

It is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java

Final journey: The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday following their final plane flight, from Bali to Cilacap in southern Java

And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth.

Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons.

At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.

At around 12.40am on January 18 this year, five drug traffickers were reportedly shot by firing squads in or around this place. 

Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island

Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali

This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad

Indonesia executed a total of six drug traffickers on January 18, but Vienamese woman Tran Thi Bich Hanh met her fate on the mainland of central java at a place called Boyolali.

The five executed at Nirbaya on Nuskambangan were Brazilian Marco Archer Moreiea, 53, who smuggled 13kg of coaine in hangliding equipment to Bali in 2004, Dutch national Ang Kiem Soei, who ran an Ecstasy factory, Namaona Denis, 48, Indonesian woman, Rani Andriani, 38, and Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, 38, a Muslim who elected to be buried on the island.

The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out. 

They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'.

Channel One Indonesia took a camera to Nirbaya (above) on Nusakambangan pirson island  prior to the first round of executions which took place in January and completed death sentences for one Indonesian woman and four men from Brazil, Nigeria, Malawi and the Netherlands 

Port of no return: Sodong port (above) on Nusakambangan Island was the dropping off point on Wednesday for the Australian Bali Nine duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation 

Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled  for each prisoner.

In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner.

When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution.

A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place.

Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.
