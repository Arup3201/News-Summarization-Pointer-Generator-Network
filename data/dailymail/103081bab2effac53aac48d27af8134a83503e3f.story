Working up an appetite: Prince Harry took a break from watching sport to play in a charity polo match at Cirencester Park on Sunday.

Whether watching the Olympics to cheer on Team GB or saddling up for a charity polo match himself, all this sport seems to have left Prince Harry with a hearty appetite.

And the third in line to the British throne had no hesitation about popping to the local shops for a bite to eat when he was spotted at Marks & Spencers in Kensington High Street, West London, earlier today.

Just like anyone else, the Queen’s grandson joined hundreds of people during the lunchtime rush to peruse the sandwich section, before moving on to the fruit and veg.

With a dark blue baseball cap pulled 
down to hide his face, checked shirt, jeans and favoured brown loafers, 
the 27-year-old could have been mistaken for a regular shopper - albeit 
with an equally casually-dressed minder in tow.

It’s not the first time Prince Harry has been spotted doing his own shopping.

Last year the young Royal stunned a 
crowd of onlookers when he loaded a trolley with frozen pizzas, beer and
for a healthier snack, bananas, at a Walmart supermarket in California, while on a visit to the United States for military training.

And not to show preference for any 
one particular supermarket, High Street Harry was spotted again doing 
the weekly shop at Tesco near his airbase in Copdock, Ipswich.

Royal lunch: Prince Harry was spotted perusing the sandwich aisle at this branch of Marks & Spencer in High Street Kensington.

Away from the food stores, Prince Harry has been leading a busy schedule. 

Yesterday, he joined older brother Prince William in a charity polo match at Cirencester Park in the Cotswolds.

Battling it out on opposing sides, the young royals saddled up to help raise money for Centrepoint, which works with the young homeless; Wellchild, a national charity for sick children and Dolen Cymru, which supports impoverished children in the African kingdom of Lesotho.

The Royal Team GB Ambassadors then drove off to the Olympic Park to watch Usain Bolt race to victory in the much-anticipated men’s 100 metres race.

Princes at play: William and Harry were on opposing sides at the charity match.

Bolt-ing back to the Games: Prince Harry wore Jamaican colours as he accompanied his brother and sister-in-law to watch the men's 100m finals.
