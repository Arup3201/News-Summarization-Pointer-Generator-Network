Coldplay serenaded hundreds of fans in a small inner-western suburb of Sydney on Tuesday, while filming their latest music video.

The fans had spent most of the day waiting in Newtown for the chance to appear as extras in the band’s video for the single A Sky Full Of Stars.

Frontman Chris Martin stood on a podium, dressed in a singlet and carrying a one-man-band kit, flanked by his bandmates who also doned similar colourful outfits.

Coldplay serenaded thousands of fans on the set of their new music video shoot for the song for A Sky Full Of Stars in Sydney's Newtown on Tuesday

Donning their jazzed-up instruments, the band marched through the streets while they performed, stopping in front of the Martin Luther King 'I Have A Dream' mural

The video involved the band members - Chris Martin, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland and Will Champion - walking from Kelly's Bar on King Street, carrying their one-man-band kits as they marched through the streets, followed by the extras like modern-day Pied Pipers.

They stopped in front of the Martin Luther King 'I Have A Dream' mural, before ending up in a park beside the Black Star pastry cafe.

The extras had responded to the tweet sent out by the band's manager, Phil Harvey, on Monday night asking for fans to turn up at the Courthouse Hotel in Newtown.

Thousands of people turned up to watch the band. Three shots of the song were taken according to an onlooker

That's different! The four band members had components of a massive drum set strapped to their backs to add a quirky twist for the video clip

Celebration: Since the song is called A Sky Full Of Stars, an array of confetti was used to enhance the atmosphere on set

A bartender from the Courthouse, Poe Darby, 23, told the Mail Online that the band kept all the details quiet right up until the last minute.

'We got a call last week and it was kind of anonymous call and it almost sounded like prank. They said it was a kind of known band and it might be up to 100 people and they wanted to check our availability,' Mr Darby said.

'Only the night before filming their clip, they actually came in and said it was Coldplay and it was going to be a bit of a bigger crowd than originally expected.'

Bulking up: The Coldplay frontman reportedly pays £110 (AU$200) an hour to build definition in his arms

Poe Darby, a barman from the Courthouse who saw the band perform, said 'The atmosphere was amazing... even the people who didn't know what was going on just joined straight in'

'We did three takes down there, they played it in full then we did it in a wider shot and the second one with the glitter cannons and everything,' Mr Darby said

Mr Darby said the Courthouse is expecting the band to return sometime on Tuesday night for a possible low-key performance

He also took part in the band’s street performance during the day however, which he described as 'awesome'.

'The atmosphere was amazing. It was like a general Newtown vibe but a lot more people – and the people who didn’t know what was going on just joined straight in,' Mr Darby said.

'We did three takes down there, they played it in full then we did it in a wider shot and the second one with the glitter cannons and everything.

'Then they  played a couple of songs afterwards, just for the crowd.'

Raving crowd: Coldplay's manager Phil Harvey invited fans to turn up at the Courthouse Hotel in Newtown the next morning and needless to say, hundreds made an appearance

The hundreds of fans waited to hear Martin speak to them from the podium. The frontman, looking tanned and happy, thanked the fans and the paparazzi "for being nice".

'This is going to be on YouTube in three hours,' Martin said as everyone held their phones aloft.

'This is the strangest recording session we've ever done. We actually are recording this song,' he said.

He loves a crowd: The blonde musician enjoyed the enthusiastic fans who turned up for the music video shoot

Calling the shots: The charismatic musician wasn't afraid to give his input during the production and also happily greeted fans

Say cheese: Chris happily stopped for a fan photo as he clutched onto the guitar embellished with red tulips

After they had been serenaded, the crowd cheered. Most of them admitted they turned up for the shoot because they hadn't been able to get tickets to see the band's promotional gig in the Enmore Theatre on Thursday.

The gig at Sydney’s iconic venue sold out in just three minutes.

In the initial tweet, Harvey said the first 250 people who turned up before 11.30am would appear in the video.

By 11am, they had reached that number with many fans queuing up since 6am.

In between takes: A crew member checked over the instruments to make sure all was in check

Lining up: After the band's manager asked fans to come down and see them shoot the video, the queue of eager fans began to grow

Strumming a tune: Guitarist Jonny Buckland walked along the street and did his thing 

'When I sent out the tweet last night I thought maybe 20 or 30 people would turn up,' Harvey told the crowded beer garden of the Sydney pub.

'I'm relieved we got the 250 we need,' Harvey said.

'The only thing that worries me is that I just hope not too many other people turn up because I don't want them to be disappointed'.

Feeling the love: Chris sported a white badge clipped to his singlet that had the word 'love' written across it

Just casually walking down the steeet: Chris was more covered up earlier on before shooting began as he was swarmed by crew members

Rockstar mode: Chris kept a low profile in a black cap and matching dark shades before he eventually stripped down to a singlet for the shoot

Harvey said it was an easy decision to film the band's video in Sydney.

'We love Sydney, we love Australia. I used to live in Melbourne,' he said.

'When we knew that Sydney was on our little routes in our promo tour we said that's the spot where we want to do our shoot,' he said.

'It's kind of based on a one man band because the track itself is quite dancey and electronic,' he said of the shoot, with members of the band each wearing a one man band's kit.

'We wanted to bring it back to the human element of it'

All clear: While a red scratch was spotted on the musician's nose on Monday, there was not a mark in sight on Tuesday

Taking a step back: At one stage lead vocalist Chris followed guitarist Jonny's lead as they made their way to the set 

In uniform? Guy Berryman and Jonny Buckland from the band looked almost matching in navy jackets and charcoal trousers

The shoot finished up at 3.30pm and every extra who turned up will be able to see their name in the video's credits.

The band's visit, from June 16 to 21, will also include making an appearance on The Voice Australia, which will air on June 23.

And the musicians are said to have already recorded a generic television special, which will air on Channel 7.

Shades of blue: It seems that Jonny kept the navy sweater underneath his jacket on when he later filmed the video clip with his guitar on hand
