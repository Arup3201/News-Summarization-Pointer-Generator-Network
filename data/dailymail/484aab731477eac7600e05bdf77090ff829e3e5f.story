The suspended 'dirty' dentist at the centre of an infection-control investigation raked in more than £1,000 a day seeing huge numbers of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle.

Desmond D'Mello's alleged flouting of NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed as he treated up to 40 patients in one morning.

NHS bosses have urged any former patients who were treated by the 60-year-old at Daybrook Dental Surgery to come forward for blood tests for HIV and hepatitis.

A whistleblower claimed he re-used dirty equipment and failed to change his gloves between patients.

And it emerged the latest CQC report by health inspectors who examined the surgery in July found medical equipment was stored in a staff toilet, posing 'a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated'. 

Dentist Desmond D'Mello is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection-control measures at his Nottinghamshire practice over a 32-year period. So far more than 2,000 of his former patients have sought help and advice 

It has emerged Mr D'Mello raked in around £1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle. He sold his Georgian mansion on the outskirts of Nottingham for £1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury Nottingham flat, pictured

Six months earlier inspectors had given Mr D'Mello a clean bill of health. 

Detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23-year-old patient Amy Duffield is linked to dental treatments she received.

More than 1,300 people have so far contacted a helpline set up to advise former patients, and another 600 have visited a dedicated clinic to seek blood tests.

It comes as the true scale of Mr D'Mello's vast income has emerged, fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle.

The 60-year-old lived in a lavishly furnished Georgian mansion and drove a range of sports cars, including a Mercedes, a Porsche and a Ferrari, with personalised number plates. 

The impressive Georgian mansion stands in seven-acres of grounds.

It features seven bedrooms, three reception rooms and a study, garages for three cars, a tennis court, pond, wood, meadow and secret garden.

It is built on land formerly owned by the Seely family, renowned landowners in Nottinghamshire.

He sold the £1.5million grade two listed property, Ramsdale Farm, on the outskirts of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of Nottingham. 

Dentists are paid per patient, earning a minimum of £18.50 for a basic check-up and polish on the NHS.

Health bossees revealed Mr D'Mello saw 166 patients in a three-day period when he was filmed by a whistleblower in June.

At an average of 55 patients a day, Mr D'Mello would have earned a minimum of £1,017 a day and around £3,071 if all patients were paying the minimum fee.

If 55 patients a day was an average for Mr D'Mello, it means the 60-year-old would have earned in excess of £371,000 a year, before tax.

It is not known how many of Mr D'Mello's patients had their treatment fully funded by the NHS.

But it is unlikely that over the course of the three-day period in June Mr D'Mello only treated those patients charged the minimum fee.

Dentists charge NHS patients according to three bands - a band two appointment costs £50.50 and a band three, for the most complex procedures including dentures and bridges, costs £219. 

It is therefore likely that Mr D'Mello's earnings were in excess of £,3,071 across the three days, and £371,000 a year.

Nottinghamshire Police are making enquiries into the death of Amy Duffield, 23, a patient of Mr D'Mello who died unexpectedly last year

Dr Doug Black, a medical director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'He saw 166 patients in a three-day period.

'That is a lot of patients. The footage showed us there were serious lapses.'  

Mr D'Mello, who studied at the University of Manchester and qualified in 1977, was suspended for just 18 months in August by the General Dental Council, pending the start of the investigation.

NHS dentists are paid according to three bands.

Band 1: £18.50 covers an examination, diagnosis and advice. If necessary it will also cover X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment

Band 2: £50.50 covers all treatment covered by band one, plus additional treatment including fillings, root canal and removing teeth.

Band 3: £219 covers all treatments covered in bands one and two, plus complex procedures including crowns, dentures and bridges

Miss Duffield, 23, visited her GP on August 18, 2013, suffering from palpitations, and was taken to Queen's Medical Centre before being transferred to Nottingham City Hospital, where she died on August 22 of viral acute myocarditis.  

Now Nottinghamshire Coroner Mairin Casey, who was not made aware that she had visited Mr D'Mello's surgery prior to her death, has asked police to investigate.

Miss Duffield's death was attributed to natural causes and because she died in hospital no inquest was held. 

The coroner has to power to order an inquest if she feels there are any questions over her death. 

NHS England has set aside £500,000 for a massive operation to recall the 22,000 patients he treated in a career spanning three decades.

Patients say their dentist's fall from grace has sent shockwaves through their community. 

He was as a well-liked and popular man before he left his role at the surgery earlier this year.

One former patient of Mr D'Mello, Chris Dalkin, told MailOnline he had only ever been impressed by his dentist of more than 20 years.

He said: 'He is a brilliant dentist. Professional, courteous and the same goes for the staff.

'A very popular dentist as the large numbers involved prove.

'The whole thing stinks. I hate to think what Mr D'Mello is going through.' 

Rumours of his suspension had spread through the community before this week's report was released by the General Dental Council, criticising his hygiene practices.

Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission visited Daybrook Dental Surgery on July 17.

Their inspection came a month after a whistleblower raised concerns with health bosses over alleged infection-control breaches.

In August, a report into their findings, found the practice failing in three of the five areas assessed - cleanliness and infection control, safety, availability and suitability of equipment and assessing and monitoring the quality of service provision.

The report highlighted a range of hygiene concerns.

Inspectors noted: 'We observed the staff toilet and the room next to the toilet were being used as store rooms for equipment. 

'This posed a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated. 

'This risk had not been identified by staff at the dental surgery and no action had been taken to minimise it.

'We saw that mops and buckets for cleaning the practice were stored directly next to the staff toilet, in the same room, which again posed a risk of this cleaning equipment coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated.' 

The report noted the practice had an infection-control programme in place, and that it had been reviewed in February 2013.

Inspectors had visited the clinic just six months before, in November last year, and gave it a clean bill of health.

Martin Clamp, 24, a construction worker from Daybrook said: 'When my partner told me about it, I was speechless. I came straight down to the centre and registered to be tested. 

'I had three teeth out earlier this year and there were no problems but it makes you think.

'It all makes me feel uneasy, worried and a little bit scared. I've been going there all my life and if I've got something in my blood and passed it on to my partner, she could have given it to my son when she was pregnant.' 

Emma Hopewell, 27, from Arnold, said she was worried about the situation because she is eight months pregnant.

She said: 'I'm having to get my children to go and have blood tests because of this, and I'm pregnant I shouldn't be having to worry about it.

'I think it's disgusting. It's a small dentist so I know they kept files in the toilets, so it wouldn't surprise me if he kept equipment in there as well.' 

She said they had been given packs with advice in and now had to wait 14 days until they find out the results.

Her mother, Iris Brace, 54, also of Arnold, said: 'It's absolutely disgusting. To think that our whole family has been going to see him for so long and now we're all having to get tested over this.' 

NHS England said 1,333 patients had so far called the helpline, and more than 600 people had gone to a clinic set up to deal with queries and perform precautionary blood tests.

A spokeswoman said 452 patients had so far been tested at the clinic in Arnold, Nottingham. 

A dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support.

Anyone who is concerned can call the advice line on 03330 142479 from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.  

NHS England has also set up a temporary Community Clinic for patients, to provide further advice, counselling, and where necessary blood testing. 

Patients can visit the clinic from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, at the Arnold Health Centre, located at Highcroft Medical Centre on High Street in Arnold, Nottingham. 

Anyone who lives outside the area, or is housebound should contact the advice line for information about how to access screening.
