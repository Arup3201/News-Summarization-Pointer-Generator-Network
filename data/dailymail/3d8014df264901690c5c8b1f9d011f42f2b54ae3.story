A Spanish tourist resort is trying out the idea of using dogs as lifeguards - and the idea is working so well it could catch on elsewhere.

The experiment in the coastal town of San Pedro del Pinatar, in the southern province of Murcia, began when a human lifeguard started taking his pet Newfoundland out to sea with him, and found he was not only an incredibly strong swimmer, he was also able to pull a very large weight.

Since then 'Bruno' has been employed full time as a lifeguard, assisting his owner David Alvarez on rescues and convincing the local coastguard to recruit more dogs to help patrol the area.

On patrol: Bruno's webbed feet and ultra-buoyant coat make him a natural swimmer. He also boasts an ability to swim up to three miles without tiring and can drag a load of up to one and a half tonnes

When Mr Alvarez first purchased Bruno as a two-month-old puppy weighing only 15lbs, he didn't expect him to be anything more than a much-loved pet.

But after taking him to the beach one day and allowing him to swim in the water, the lifeguard realised that his rapidly-growing canine friend might just have the potential to become a colleague.

'I just wanted a dog as a pet and had not
 really thought about working with him in my job as a lifeguard, but 
after I had him two weeks I took him with me to the sea and realised 
what a fantastic swimmer he was,' Mr Alvarez said.

Bruno's thick double layer of fur and webbed feet make him a natural swimmer, adding to his buoyancy and allowing him to cut through the water with ease.

And in the searing heat of the Spanish summer, there is nothing black-furred Bruno loves more than to cool off with a dip in the sea.

Although
 Bruno is making front-page news in Spain, he is actually following a 
long tradition of Newfoundland dogs being used for water rescue work.

In
 1995 a 10-month-old Newfoundland named Boo saved a hearing-impaired man
 from drowning in the Yuba River in Northern California.

Boo
 noticed the struggling man while he and his owner were walking by the 
river.

He instinctively jumped into the water, dragging the drowning man
 to shore by holding on to his arm.

According to Janice Anderson, the Newfoundland's breeder, Boo had received no formal training in water rescue and simply showed a natural ability for both swimming and saving lives.

It's not just his talent for swimming that makes Bruno an ideal lifeguard. His incredible strength and stamina means he can easily swim three miles before getting tired and needing a rest.

Mr Alvarez has also given Bruno a few strength tests and was shocked to discover he could quite happily drag water-filled plastic containers weighing up to one and half tonnes back to shore.

With him showing all the assets of a natural lifeguard, it wasn't long before Bruno started accompanying Mr Alvarez on rescues - testing whether he could do in a life-or-death situation what he was easily capable of while fooling around with his owner.

The results were unsurprisingly positive, with Bruno easily capable of dragging a drowning - and often panicking - person back to the shore with the minimum of fuss.

'If I 
rush out to rescue someone and there is a second person with them, then 
Bruno can carry one of them and pull them to shore. Or if I get tired, 
he can pull us both or we take turns at pulling the other person,' Mr 
Alvarez said.

'I
 wasn't sure if my employers go for it but after trials they really love
 the idea, and now I think they are planning to get other lifeguard 
dogs,' he added.

Bruno 
may be the first lifeguard rescue dog ever to be used in San Pedro del Pinatar, but it now looks as if he is unlikely to be the last.
