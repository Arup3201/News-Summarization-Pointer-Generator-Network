His heroics more than a hundred years ago during a deadly battle close to the Afghanistan border mirrored the bravery of Britain's Taliban-fighting soldiers.

Now a Victoria Cross won by an army officer who only stopped fighting when he fainted - having been shot three times - has emerged for sale for £180,000.

Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Watson had already been hit in the thigh trying to clear a village in British India of murderous warriors when he insisted on going back.

Lr Col Watson led a 'few' men on a charge to remove tribesmen from the village of Bilot (pictured) in what was then British India

He was shot again in the arm, had his hand smashed by a bullet and he had to be carried from the battlefieldby his men after passing out due to blood loss.

It was noted that the officer had 'in all probability saved the whole force from being wiped out' by the Pashtun enemy in what is now northern Pakistan in 1897.

Despite the gravity of his condition Lt Col Watson later modestly described his injuries as nothing more than a flesh wound when he wrote home to his wife so as not to panic her.

Lt Col Watson's actions received praise by a young Winston Churchill who was part of the relief force that arrived the following day.

Churchill later wrote of Lt Col Watson's heroics: '...the man will go on, unshaken and unflinching after he has received a severe and painful wound.'

Lt Col Watson was awarded the VC for his bravery. He went on to serve in World War One but died from illness in 1917.

The medal, the highest military decoration for valour in the face of an enemy, has been passed down through the Watson family who are now selling it at auction.

David Erskine-Hill, of London auctioneers Dix Noonan and Webb, said: 'The North West Frontier was so oft the scene of savage fighting and heavy casualties in days of the Empire.

'And the story behind Thomas Watson's VC epitomises the very nature of that fighting - a small hillside village, surrounded by overwhelming numbers of hostile tribesmen, and a remarkable band of British and Indian troops who held on against all the odds, until relieved.

'Watson led two hair-raising charges at the cost of multiple wounds, including a shattered hand and ruptured artery.

'No wonder Winston Churchill, who arrived with the relief force the following morning, was later moved to describe Watson's courage as 'sublime'.

'But in common with many fellow VCs, Watson remained extremely modest about his accomplishments, his charming letter to his wife, written in haste soon after those momentous events, merely referring to one or two 'grazes.'

Lt Col Watson, from Louth, Lincolnshire, was commissioned in to the Royal Engineers in 1888.

He married his wife Edith Welchman, who herself had previously been awarded the Royal Red Cross for her efforts in the nursing of British soldiers in India.

In July 1897 an army of 10,000 Pashtun tribesmen lay siege to the British garrison in Malakand.

Months later, on the night of September 16 at the village of Bilot that was being held by the enemy, Lt Col Watson rounded up 'a few' men of the East Kent Regiment and of the Bengal Sappers.

He led them in a charge to remove the tribesmen who retaliated with heavy fire.

In his 1898 book, the Story of the Malakand Field Force, Churchill wrote of how the burning village was a 'shambles' when the relief party arrived the next day.

The future Prime Minister wrote: 'All round lay corpses of men and mules. The bodies of five or six native soldiers were being buried in a hurriedly dug grave.

'Eighteen wounded men lay side by side in a roofless hut, their faces drawn by pain and anxiety looked ghastly in the pale light of the early morning.'

Churchill's account of the action the night before stated: 'The village was too large for so small a party to clear.

'The tribesmen killed and wounded several of the soldiers and a bullet smashed Lieutenant Watson's hand. He however continued his efforts and did not cease until again shot, this time so severely as to be unable to stand.

Lt Col Watson's actions received praise by a young Winston Churchill who was part of the relief force that arrived the following day. The officers 'record of services' is shown above

'His men carried him from the village.'

Four days later, while recovering from his wounds, Lt Col Watson wrote the letter to 'my own darling' wife.

He wrote his getting injured: 'I got touched on the right leg, only a graze...I went back to get some Sappers...I hurried back and was pointing out where the devils were sneaking up when I got a slight flesh wound in the inside of the right arm - nothing of consequence but unfortunately almost immediately afterwards I got hit badly on the left hand.'

The brave officer went on to fight in the First World War and was the commanding engineer of the 12th Inidian Division in Mesopotamia (Iraq) against the Ottoman Empire.

He contracted an illness from which he died in London in June 1917 aged 50.

Lt Col Watson's Victoria Cross has recently been bequeathed to three grown up children who have decided it is best to sell it now as it cannot be divided between them. The VC along with other medals and letters home is being sold on December 10.
