A 21-year-old mother from Long Island mysteriously disappeared on Friday night after she went to work and then out with friends.

Sarah Patricia Goode, 21, is thought to have gone missing under 'suspicious circumstances,' after police found Goode's 1999 BMW parked a mile away from her house on Fire Avenue near new London Avenue in Medford.

Police say the car showed obvious signs of a struggle and a witness said that there appeared to be blood in the vehicle.

Found? Police have found a body in woodland they believe might be Long Island medical technician, Sarah Goode. Her car was found, empty and near the woods, shortly after her family reported her missing last week

Police are thoroughly searching the woods near where Goode's car was found but they have found nothing as of yet

Goode who works as a medical technician and who is the mother of a four-year-old lives in Suffolk with her mother and her daughter.

NBC reports that a woman who lived a mile away  on the street where the car was found noticed that the license plate was bent and that the numbers were obscured. Thinking the car might have been stolen, she reported it to police.

Officers are searching the woods where the car was spotted but have found nothing as of yet.

'This is a 21-year-old lady. She has a 4-year-old daughter, a very close family — and the circumstances, as I’ve explained, are suspicious to us,' said Suffolk County police Detective Sgt. Michael Fitzharris.

'Your baby girl can’t wait to give you that great big hug when you come home. We just want you to come home safely,' Goode's sister Elizabeth DeMuria said tearfully.

'Please, if anybody knows anything, please let somebody know,' she added.

Neighbors fear for Goode's safety as well as for their own and hope that she is out of harm's way.

'We’re horrified – I mean, we’re praying that she, you know, maybe just didn’t tell her parents where she was going,' one neighbor told CBS.

Goode recently broke up with her boyfriend but police don't have any suspects nor have they chosen a person of interest.

Goode's friends and family say she has no drug or alcohol problems and they describe her as 'gracious, outgoing, and caring.'

She is described as being 5 feet, 3 inches tall, weighing 100 pounds and having long, brown hair with blond highlights, brown eyes and a flower tattoo on her foot.

Anyone with information regarding Goode's disappearance is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at (800) 220-TIPS.
