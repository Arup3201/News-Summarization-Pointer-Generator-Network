Southampton have opened a new state-of-the-art training centre in honour of their former owner Markus Liebherr.

The south coast club officially opened the Markus Liebherr Pavillion on Wednesday, which is the focal point of the Staplewood Football Development Centre.

It's hoped the top class training facility will help the club continue its proud record of producing top level talent from their academy.

Southampton's new training facility has been named after former owner Markus Liebherr who 'saved' the club from financial ruin

Markus Liebherr, who died in 2010, stepped in and bought the club back in 2009 when the club had suffered several years of decline, following relegation from the Premier League in 2005.

The new training facility will house the club's sports science, scouting and recruitment, football administration and medical departments, as well as training, changing and dining facilities.

Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger commented: 'We are delighted to officially open our new training facility and, in doing so, we are proud to pay tribute to the memory of Markus Liebherr.

'The role Markus played in saving Southampton Football Club and enabling it to be transformed into the progressive and sustainable company it is today will never be forgotten.

'In naming this outstanding new facility in his honour, Markus's vision and legacy will live on in every player and member of staff who passes through these doors.'

Chief Executive Officer Gareth Rogers added: 'Markus bought the club in 2009 and his vision was to create a sustainable football club and one that plays great football.

'Integral to that was the building of the training ground. This has required a huge investment, but it is something that we see as incredibly important in terms of the future of our club. The club is about sustainability.

'Most of the cost has come from [Markus's daughter and current owner] Katharina's wealth, so it is right that there is a lasting memory of Markus at the club.'

The Saints, currently sitting second in the Premier League after an astonishing start to the season, have a track record of producing fine academy players.

The likes of Real Madrid galactico Gareth Bale, Arsenal trio Theo Walcott, Calum Chambers and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, along with Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are just a selection of recent academy graduates.

Southampton appear to be a club that never rests on their laurels and have already applied for permission to enhance the facilities on offer in the Markus Liebherr Pavilion.

Construction of an inflatable dome over Staplewood's 3G pitch is already under way as the club hopes to integrate their academy players with the senior squad on a more permanent basis.

'This is only phase one of a big project. At the moment, we have what we call the Academy Village, which is a portacabin village at the other end of the training ground. It reflects the quality of the people we have that we've been able to produce a world-class academy in what are essentially temporary facilities,' added Executive Director of Football Les Reed.

'We're always looking forward, and the fact that we've done it in phases has meant that we've learned things as we've gone along, and everyone will benefit from that - from the academy through to the first team.'
