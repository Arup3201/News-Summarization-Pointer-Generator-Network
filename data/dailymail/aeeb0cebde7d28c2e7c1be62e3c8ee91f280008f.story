France has rejected imposing a ban on super-skinny fashion models - beause a law would risk discriminating against 'thin people' in the workplace.

Left-wing MPs had demanded six-month prison terms or fines of £60,000 for fashion bosses who 'glorify anorexia' by hiring underweight girls.

They had called for models to carry medical certificates showing their body mass index - calculated by dividing one's weight in kilogrammes by the square of one's height in metres.

Unhealthy: France has rejected imposing a ban on super-skinny fashion models. The ban was called for by a Socialist politician who said prison sentences to be handed out to fashion bosses who employ them

Socialist politician Olivier Veran told French daily Le Parisien: 'It's intolerable to promote malnutrition and to commercially exploit people who are endangering their own health.

'A level of acceptable body mass index should be set and enforced. Websites encouraging young girls to lose weight should also be banned.'

But the nation's parliament yesterday rejected the socialist MPs amendment to France's new health bill on the grounds that it would 'discriminate against jobseekers on the grounds of their weight'.

Mr Veran and fellow MPs said they would now re-write their amendment in the hope of incorporating it into the bill, which will be debated again later this year.

Thin:  Olivier Veran had demanded that all models be forced to present a certificate of good health before being allowed on the catwalk. France said such rules would risk discriminating against 'thin people'

There are now 40,000 people in France suffering from anorexia, around 90 per cent of whom are adolescents, according to the latest health ministry figures.

In Norway, MPs have proposed that images of airbrushed fashion models should come with a 'cigarette-packet' style health warning in a bid to tackle eating disorders.

One suggested text for the Norwegian warning would read: 'This advertisement has been altered and presents an inaccurate image of how this model really looks.'

Spain has already barred models below a certain body mass index from the Madrid fashion shows. Italy has insisted on health certificates for fashion show participants.

And Brazil is considering demands to ban underage, underweight models from its catwalks.

Medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models, and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner, which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six.

Fashion guru Giorgio Armani said two years ago that the fashion industry had a duty to 'work together against anorexia'.

He added at the time: 'The industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women.'
