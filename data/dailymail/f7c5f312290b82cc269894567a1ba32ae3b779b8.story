Two weeks after Creed frontman Scott Stapp was placed on psych hold for 72 hours after telling cops he hears voices that say his son will be killed by ISIS, his estranged wife Jaclyn is trying to get him committed again - for 60 days.

Jaclyn claims Scott is trying to detox with no help, and that he is 'deep into drugs, including amphetamines, steroids, weed, coke, PCP, Ketamine and others. 

She believes that he will harm himself or others if not treated according to TMZ.

'I went two days without eating and I ended up in an emergency room': Creed frontman Scott Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video posted Wednesday

Cryptic: He also posted a message to Facebook on Friday saying it was his 'last statement' 

The revelation comes two days after it emerged that Jaclyn, his wife of eight years, former Miss New York, filed for divorce last month, claiming the former millionaire threatened to kill her and their two children - and that he has guns to do so.

In fresh legal documents she also alleges that Stapp called their child's school warning of an ISIS attack on November 10. 

She said he was driven to believe biological weapons and Satan were coming to Florida. 

Stapp wrote rather cryptically on Facebook Friday, 'I'm going to step back and let God control everything from here on. I should have continued to do that before I allowed my hurt, frustration, and emotions take control and post those videos. All I can say is that the truth will set you (me) free, and I'm holding on to Jeremiah 29:11 and Isaiah 44:8.' 

'This is a test of faith, and I will NEVER give up or lose my faith. No matter what. This will be my last statement until after justice is served. Love to you all my friends.'

Stapp, who was once worth $10 million, recorded a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video last Friday insisting he is 'as sober as can be'. In the recording he revealed he is now broke, homeless, and living in a Holiday Inn.

According to Mrs Stapp, the father-of-three sent a text message that read: 'Florida is not safe. Biological weapons on the way. U have to leave with kids and meet me in Atlanta.'

Another said: 'I'm coming to get you Satan and children. No mercy. You know how this ends. God created you and now God is ending you.'

Stapp denies allegations of drug abuse, insisting he's as 'sober as can be'. 

On Wednesday he took to Facebook lambasting the claims, revealed in the Miami Herald.

He said 'all hell broke loose' after an audit of his record company and personal accounts found 'people have stolen money from me'.  

Admitted to followers that he is now homeless, he explained: 'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of God, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck.

'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.'

The Grammy winner sold an estimated 53 million records worldwide with his neo-grunge band in their nineties heyday.

'I want you to know your dad is sober - no drugs no alcohol!' In the video, the Dying to Live crooner pleads his sobriety to his children - Jagger, 16, Milan, 7, and Daniel, 4 (pictured in August)

But 15 years after the release of hit single With Arms Wide Open, Stapp is 'completely penniless'. 

'During the course of that audit a lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me or royalties not paid,' he said. 

'There's people who have taken advantage and stolen money from me, and they're trying to discredit me, slander me, and I've even been threatened that if I went public like I'm doing right now, that any impropriety I've done in the past, that these individuals can get their hands to humiliate and embarrass me and try to ruin my credibility.' 

He added: 'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless.

'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, "Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months." I don't understand how that's fair America.' 

The comment was an apparent response to his estranged wife Jaclyn Nesheiwat, who claimed he was using amphetamines, crystal meth, and steroids in her divorce paperwork. 

It comes seven years after the Dying To Live singer openly apologizing to Jaclyn for assaulting her with an Orangina bottle following his arrest in 2007. She dropped the charges.

In his home video, Stapp pleads his sobriety to his children - Jagger, 16, Milán, 7, and Daniel, 4.

'They've been through a lot over the years, especially my son Jagger,' Stapp said.

'These rumors going around right now are hurting him very bad...I want you to know Jagger, your dad is sober - no drugs no alcohol. This is a vicious attack because people we know, and at the record company, and outside that have stolen a lot of money.'

He announced he was looking for 'an honest, good attorney that's ready to fight and take it all the way to the top.'
