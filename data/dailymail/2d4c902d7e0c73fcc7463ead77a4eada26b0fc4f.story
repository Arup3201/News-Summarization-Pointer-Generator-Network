Louis van Gaal is interested in appointing Roy Keane as his assistant manager if he is given the job of replacing David Moyes as Manchester United manager.

The Dutchman is among the favourites to take charge at Old Trafford this summer, with owners the Glazer family keen to get the club back on track after Moyes' disastrous 10 months at the helm.

Club chiefs are interested in retaining at least one former player to help manage the first team next season, opening up the possibility of Keane returning after more than eight years away.

New man? Holland boss Louis van Gaal is tipped to replace David Moyes as Manchester United manager

The 42-year-old is currently assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland's senior team, working under boss Martin O'Neill.

‘I
 don’t know anything about it, I really don’t,’ said O’Neill on a flying
 visit to Dublin on Wednesday to open a football pitch in Rathfarnham.

Keane's experience as a manager, most notably with Sunderland, is attractive to both United and Van Gaal as they plan for the future.

The 62-year-old is understood to remember Keane's impressive performance against his country in 2001, a game which stopped Holland qualifying for the following year's World Cup.

Keane is precisely the type of iron-willed personality needed to ‘sort out’ Manchester United’s problems, according to Hull City and Ireland midfielder David Meyler.

The 24-year-old Republic of Ireland international, plucked from the Airtricity League by Keane six years ago, has no doubts about the ability of the Ireland assistant manager to revive United’s fortunes, if asked.

‘Do I think he’s good enough to do the [United] job? Yes, of course. He’d sort out a lot of stuff out there fairly lively,’ said Meyler.

‘For me, he’s probably the best Irish footballer ever. To try and learn so much off him would be great,’ he added.

Ryan Giggs has been installed as the interim manager while senior club staff begin the process of searching for and naming a new manager following the departure of Moyes just 10 months into a six-year contract.

The role for Giggs is purely temporary, with officials at the club not confident they can impress the midfielder upon any new manager's backroom staff.

Nevertheless, Giggs has the full support of his mentor Sir Alex Ferguson and  see him as a United boss in the long-term.
