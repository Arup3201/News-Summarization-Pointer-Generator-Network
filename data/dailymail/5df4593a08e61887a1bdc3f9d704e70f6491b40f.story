A 26-year-old man who had been on the run for five days after allegedly shooting dead five people including his wife and her 16-year-old daughter has been arrested, police have said.

Thomas Lee reportedly gunned down his wife, Christie Lee, 33, her daughter, Bailey Burtron, and his parents-in-law, Sheila and William Burtron,  68 and 69, at their Georgia home on Wednesday.

He then fatally shot 18-year-old Iiaonna Green, who was living with the family at the suburban LaGrange property at the time, before fleeing the scene and going on the run, it is alleged.

However, five days later, Lee has been arrested by police following a massive manhunt. He was located in the Mississippi city of Tupelo, around 270 miles from his home.

Arrest: Thomas Lee, who had been on the run for five days after allegedly shooting dead five people including his wife, Christie Lee (pictured with Lee) and her 16-year-old daughter, has been arrested, police have said

Victims: Lee reportedly gunned down his 33-year-old wife, her daughter, Bailey Burtron (left), her parents Sheila and William Burtron, aged 68 and 69 , and family friend Iiaonna Green (right), 18, at their Georgia home

Killed: Sheila (right) and William (left) Burton were among the victims apparently shot dead by their son-in-law

According to CBS, the suspect was tracked down to a bus station at 4.30pm on Monday following a tip. He is being held at the Lee County Adult Detention Center on five charges of malice murder. 

Police were first alerted to the mass murder on Saturday night after Mr Burtron's co-workers became concerned that he had missed a couple of days work without contacting them, it is reported.

When sheriff's deputies arrived at the property, they saw the families' cars parked outside and rang the doorbell multiple times. After no-one answered, they forced their way into the house.

Inside, the deputies discovered the five victims' bodies. Mr Burton's corpse was sprawled across the kitchen floor, while the other four victims had been slain in three separate bedrooms.

Investigators later determined Mrs Lee, Miss Burtron and her grandparents and Miss Green had been dead for around three days. They had each been shot, but no weapon was recovered.

Police immediately began searching for Lee, who was not present at the scene. By Monday, they had obtained arrest warrants charging the suspect with five counts of malice murder.

Crime scene: Lee was located in the Mississippi city of Tupelo, around 270 miles (a four-hour drive) away from his home. Above, an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation walks towards Lee's home on Monday

During the wide-scale search for Lee, Troup County Sheriff James Woodruff told the media that he believed the suspect may be driving an olive green Mazda Tribute SUV with Georgia license plates.

'If this happened Wednesday night and he left immediately, he's got five days that he could be anywhere,' Sheriff Woodruff said in a phone interview on Monday before Lee was found. 

'We canvassed the entire neighborhood and talked to next door neighbors and people down the street, and nobody saw or heard a thing.'

He added that the U.S. Marshals Service had been called in to assist, and that investigators were following up on tips from people who may have seen the suspect in Tennessee, Florida and Ohio.

Distance: Lee traveled from his LaGrange, Georgia, home to the Mississippi city of Tupelo, 267 miles away

Charged: Lee (pictured, left, and right, with his wife) was tracked down to a bus station at 4.30pm on Monday following a tip. He is being held at the Lee County Adult Detention Center on five charges of malice murder

Autopsies were being conducted on Monday. Sheriff Woodruff cautioned that although the victims appear to have been shot, officials cannot be certain until the autopsies have been performed.

At the time of their deaths, the Burtrons, the Lees and Miss Green were living in a quiet suburb outside LaGrange, about 80 miles southwest of Atlanta and just east of the Alabama state line.

No prior domestic problems had been reported at the property, Mr Woodruff said.
