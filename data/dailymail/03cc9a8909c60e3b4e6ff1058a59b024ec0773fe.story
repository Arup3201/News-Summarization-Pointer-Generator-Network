A 10-year-old boy has died after suffering a severe head injury when the modified golf cart he was riding in tipped over and rolled over on top of him at an exclusive gated community north of Beverly Hills.

Mark Martinez died on Sunday evening at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, about two hours after the crash.

The incident occurred in Beverly Park, which is  home to a large number of Hollywood A-listers including Eddie Murphy, Mark Wahlberg, Denzel Washington, Charlie Sheen, Sylvester Stallone and Samuel L. Jackson.

A 10-year-old boy was pronounced dead on Sunday evening after he crashed a modified golf cart at the exclusive Beverly Park community in L.A.

Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey says the cart was carrying two men and three boys when it overturned.

The 10-year-old boy was rushed to the hospital in grave condition. The other occupants were not injured. L.A. Police are investigating the wreck but could provide no further details. 

It is common for residents to travel 
throughout the gated community by moped, bikes and modified golf carts 
which travel faster than a typical golf cart.

Beverly Park, located along Mulholland Drive, is a wealthy neighborhood of homes that typically list between $15 million and $50 million.

Two of the cast members of The Real 
Housewives of Beverly Hills – Lisa Vanderpump and Adrienne Maloof – are 
former residents of the exclusive enclave.

In 2011, Maloof's husband Dr. Paul Nassif made the 911 call that saved neighbor Charlie Sheen’s life after he called him complaining of 'severe abdominal pains.'
