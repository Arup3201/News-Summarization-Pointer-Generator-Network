One of Britain's most picturesque railway lines, which cost £35 million to repair when it was nearly destroyed by winter storms in February, is in peril again after 'huge' cracks appeared in it.

Gaping holes appeared in the sea wall which protects the main railway line through Dawlish, Devon after it was battered by storms on Tuesday.

In early February the track was swept away with part of the sea wall cutting off the service linking Cornwall and much of Devon with the rest of the UK.

A 300-strong Network Rail team rebuilt the track at a cost of £35 million.

In total, £15 million was spent repairing the area outside Dawlish station where track had been left dangling.

It cost an additional £20 million to repair tracks either side of the town.

Now a 20-foot long stretch of the sea wall has been damaged again leaving gaping holes and precariously exposed coping stones.

Dawlish residents took to social media to express their concerns over yesterday's damage.

Rob Coleman said: 'I fear for the future of the route. I have said all along that there is an agenda out there to get it changed - things like today, although exaggerated, does not help the town one bit.

'The business fraternity west of us will not want a train line down again for any length of time.'

Elliot Watson said: 'The sea will always win...simple.'

Rebecca Marett added: 'Ultimately the same destructive thing will happen at some point in the future, it's the sea.'

And Tony Russell said: 'Much bigger storms to come yet.'

A Network Rail spokesman said: 'The sea wall at Dawlish regularly suffers minor damage after a storm due to its close proximity to the sea. 

'This is why a team is permanently tasked with checking the wall daily and carrying out minor repairs. 

'The minor damage that occurred during last night's storm was not to the new section of the wall and will be repaired shortly.'

Julian Burnell from Network Rail added: 'I'm not too worried about this. It is pretty much business as usual at Dawlish.

'We had a thumping storm and that is why we have a team of men that have for many years gone up and down that wall all the time checking for damage and fixing it.

'In this case the coping stones at the top of the wall have been hit enough to loosen them so we closed the walkway to assess the damage.

'But we will fix the stones back in position - this is the kind of thing we deal with at Dawlish every day.

'Everybody is very sensitive after the catastrophe in February - this is nothing to worry about on that scale.'

Oliver Colvile MP said the disruption demonstrated that the South West needs a more resilient railway line.

He said: 'The idea that we are going to have this railway line that is going to break on a regular basis just isn't good enough.

'I want to make sure that we have a railway line that is a resilient one and also an alternative in case anything happens like last February and today.'
