Britain has up to eight million adults who are functionally illiterate, a report out today revealed.

The World Literacy Foundation said one in five of the UK population are so poor at reading and writing they struggle to read a medicine label or use a chequebook.

According to research, this rate of illiteracy is costing the UK economy £81billion a year in lost earnings and increased welfare spending.

That is the highest cost in Europe - twice that of Germany's and three times the drain on France's purse.

Overall the UK was ranked third worst for reading and writing behind Italy and Ireland with six to eight million people illiterate.

Report author and the foundation's 
chief executive Andrew Kay said: 'We need to treat illiteracy as a disease that we are aiming to eradicate.

'We need to understand that early intervention can avert a lifetime of hardship, poverty and pain for a child, young person or adult who is struggling to read or write.

'The key message of the report is the eradication of illiteracy should be considered an investment rather than a cost.

'The fact that over six million people in the UK are illiterate and many more people struggle to read and write is shocking in 2012.

A separate study has also revealed UK pupils have slipped from the world's seventh best in reading to 25th

'Even worse is the fact that globally, almost 800 million people are illiterate and 100 children don’t attend school each day.

'No matter whether you live in the developed or developing world, poor illiteracy is ruining lives and is linked with an array of poor life outcomes, such as poverty, unemployment, social exclusion, crime and long term illness.'

Next week, a collection of 300 of the world's top literacy experts will meet in Oxford for the inaugural World Literacy Summit to develop an action plan to design to help wipe out illiteracy.

UK pupils have slipped from the world's seventh best in reading to 25th, according to a separate study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

A spokesman for the Department for Education insisted: 'We are unashamedly determined to drive up literacy standards.'

Meanwhile, another study suggested pre-schoolers whose parents provide a stimulating home life are still reaping the benefits at the age of 14.

A study by the Institute of Education found the quality of learning during a child's early years has a strong impact on achievement in secondary school.

It reveals that children whose parents focused on their learning at a young age are generally one national curriculum level ahead in English and science, and 1.3 levels ahead in maths.

The findings come from the Effective Pre-school, Primary and Secondary Education Project, which has been following the development of around 3,000 children since 1997.

The study also shows that looking at students' background, the mother's level of qualifications was the strongest indicator of achievement.

Students with parents who were educated to degree level were more likely to be 1.4 national curriculum levels ahead in English, 1.7 levels ahead in maths and 1.5 in science. This is compared to youngsters whose parents had no qualifications.
