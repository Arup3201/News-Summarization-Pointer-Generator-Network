Red lips, professionally tousled locks, a sparkly dress ... When it comes to the red carpet, Adele certainly knows all the ingredients to looking like a star.

But when Adele went shopping in London recently she looked more like, well, one of us.

Dressed casually in tight black leggings, black and white Nike trainers and an oversized patchwork cape, the 25-year-old was barely recognisable as she browsed furniture shops at the Chelsea Harbour Design Centre.

Rushed off her feet: Adele with her baby son Angelo on a recent shopping trip to the Chelsea Harbour Design Centre

Her hair was piled on her head in a messy top knot, with loose strands blowing in the wind.

She didn’t appear to be wearing any make-up and her only item of jewellery was a thin gold chain that she wears around her neck.

In
her arms she clutched her one-year-old son, Angelo, whose face was 
covered by a hooded sweater. And she stared at the ground as she tried 
to go unnoticed.

The Someone Like You singer was looking 
at furniture at the upmarket Chelsea Harbour Design Centre, where the 
Duchess of Cambridge has also been known to shop, houses showrooms for 
some of the leading interiors brands.

Located in Chelsea, it is round the corner from the Bluebird Café, where Adele can often be found lunching with her partner Simon Konecki.

On Tuesday, however, it was just her and Angelo.

A Design Centre employee said: ‘I barely recognised her to begin 
with, we get so many celebrities come through here and they all dress 
down and look really normal so they don’t get bothered.

'She came in looking for furniture and 
went into a couple of different showrooms but she didn’t stay long, I 
don’t think she bought anything.'

Adele
has remained incredibly private and secretive about her son - who she 
has affectionately dubbed ‘little peanut’.

In
January this year rumours the singer had named her child Angelo were triggered when the singer spotted wearing the name on a gold 
necklace.

A spokesperson for the star was unavailable for comment and has still been unable to confirm the name.
