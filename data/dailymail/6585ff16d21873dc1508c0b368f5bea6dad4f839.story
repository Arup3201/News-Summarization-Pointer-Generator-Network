An old piano warehouse in Indiana that was engulfed in an inferno this weekend yielded a sight as stunning as it was unexpected: a huge rainbow that showed up as firefighters tried to douse the flames with water.

The rare sight happened while the Muncie Fire Department tried to quench the flames that broke out about 6:43am on Saturday, The Star Press reported.

Stunning: Firefighters in Indiana accidentally created this gorgeous rainbow while battling a raging blaze inside an old piano factory

Built in 1895, the three-story brick building's wood-framed structure had already caught on fire several times before.

This time, the blaze engulfed the entire building in just an hour  — roaring from one end of the huge warehouse to the other, sounding like a series of explosions at times — and kept fire crews busy for nearly the whole weekend.

Even on Monday morning, firefighters were still dumping water on the structure from an aerial truck as flare-ups continued to show up here and then.

They also kept trees nearby wet so the flames wouldn't spread.

Authorities say the 119-year-old structure's wooden frames and beams caused the fire to engulf the building as quickly as it did

The warehouse had already caught on fire several times before, but never with such intensity

Batallion Chief Terry Moore told the Star Press that his crews are yet to enter the building for fear it might collapse.

The building was deemed unsafe to be occupied as far back as 2011, when the place was covered in trash and windows were broken out, according to The Star Press.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

No injuries were reported.

Firefighters spend nearly the entire weekend trying to bring the fire down, and were still at the warehouse on Monday morning to make sure the blaze wouldn't reignite
