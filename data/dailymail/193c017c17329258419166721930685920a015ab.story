Fifty per cent more men than women fill up with the wrong type of fuel, a mistake that costs around £200 to put right – or £40million across the country each year.

An RAC report revealed today that 61 per cent of the culprits were men, while just 39 per cent were women.

It also reveals that 23 per cent of motorists admit to having run out of fuel at least once, with 12 per cent having done so on a motorway.

Research by RAC has found that men are the worst culprits for making the mistake of filling up with wrong fuel

Men were the main offenders again, with 22 per cent more male drivers than women owning up to being caught out by an empty fuel tank.

In 2013, RAC patrols were called out by more than 22,000 motorists stranded after their fuel ran out.

The RAC says men are also more likely to be repeat offenders – 6 per cent compared with 4 per cent. 

But 76 per cent of drivers claim never to have been caught out.
