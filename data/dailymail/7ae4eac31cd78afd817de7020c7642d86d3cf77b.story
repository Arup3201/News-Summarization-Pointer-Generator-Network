Google has launched its music streaming service in Britain to do battle with the likes of Spotify.

The internet giant brought Google Play Music All Access to the UK after introducing the monthly subscription service in the U.S. in May.

It is the latest company to enter the crowded music streaming market and will offer its service for £9.99 a month, like many of its competitors.

However, in a bid to undercut rivals, it will charge £7.99 if customers sign up before 15 September and has offered the service free for the first month.

Google Play Music All Access has launched in the UK. Users can store 20,000 songs for free online and listen to them on any Android device or online at play.google.com

Google Play Music All Access allows users to create an interactive radio station without advertisements.

A 'Listen Now' tab suggests artists and radio stations and the service enables customers to merge tracks in Google’s catalogue with their own music collection.

Another key function allows customers to 'pin' specific albums and playlists so they are available offline.

Paul Joyce, product manager for Google Play Music, said: 'With today’s launch, Google Play moves one step closer to your ultimate digital entertainment destination, where you can find, enjoy and share your favourite apps, games, books, movies, magazines, TV shows and music on your Android phone or tablet.'

The subscription-based service launches as a standalone product in the UK, but Google is in talks with U.S. telecoms giant Verizon about bundling the service in with mobile tariffs, that could persuade music lovers to choose a smartphone using Google's Android operating system, The Guardian reported.

All eyes will now be on Apple to see if it will compete with Google and offer a subscription-based music service of its own.

Apple is reportedly preparing to roll out iTunes Radio in the U.S. this autumn, which also focuses on personalised radio, but there is currently no news as to when the service might become available in the UK.

Music All Access also launched in Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain today, while Australia and New Zealand got the service last month.
