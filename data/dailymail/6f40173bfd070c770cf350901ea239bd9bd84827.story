A beautician died aged 21 just as she appeared to be winning her battle to lead a normal life after undergoing a heart transplant.

Amy Wild had suffered repeated complications from the 2002 operation when she was just ten which left her in a wheelchair.

Her body twice rejected the new heart in 2004 and 2007 and at one point she was given just a 20 per cent chance of survival.

Heart transplant: Amy Wild, 21, who battled back after suffering a heart attack as a 10-year-old in 2002. She died in August after her condition suddenly declined

Yet the young woman, from Heaton Morris, Greater Manchester, defied doctors predictions and had started walking and wearing high heels. She also had plans to open her own beauty treatment business.

But after complaining of chest pains and difficulties with her breathing, Amy was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester on Sunday August 11, where she was prescribed medication to combat an unusually fast heart rate. She died two days later.

Following an inquest into her death yesterday, Amy's family said they had lodged an official complaint with the hospital questioning the care she received.

Fightback: Amy Wild was described as 'healthy' before her death and had dreams of opening a beauty treatment business. She underwent a heart transplant in 2002 and her body twice rejected the organ. However, she had battled back and was leading a normal life

Beauty business dream: Amy Wild was planning to start her own company and was described as 'fit and well' when her condition suddenly deteriorated

Amy, from Heaton Norris, near 
Stockport, had always been a healthy child but problems began in 2002 
when she complained of feeling tired and suffering from a pain in her 
back.

Just days before the 
family was due to fly out to Tenerife on holiday, the youngster was 
rushed into hospital and her heart stopped five times.

She later underwent a three-hour life saving heart transplant at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London.

At the time her mother Lynne told a local newspaper: 'Doctors did not think she'd survive, but two days after the operation she was up on her feet, three weeks later she was back at home and after eight weeks she was back at school.

'She had to be flown down to London as it was a race against time to save her. The doctors can't believe that she's recovered so quick, they say they've never seen anything like it.'

Although Amy's body twice rejected the heart, she battled back.

She lost the use of a leg after spending three months on a life-support machine and underwent a hip operation in 2011 which left her able to leave her wheelchair.

She initially started walking again 
with the aid of crutches then would leave them propped up during nights 
out with friends so she could be seen standing on her own.

Deterioration: Amy went to bed early in August and was taken to hospital the next day after complaining of chest pains

2002 - Amy Wild complained of feeling tired and suffering pain in her back. She was rushed to hospital before a family holiday and her heart stopped five times.

She later underwent a heart transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.

2004 - Her body rejects the replacement heart.

2007 - Her body again rejects the replacement heart.

2011 - Amy lost the use of a leg after spending three months on a life-support machine and underwent a hip operation in 2011 which left her able to leave her wheelchair.

2013 - She learns to walk again with the aid of crutches and plans to open her own beauty company

August 10, 2013 - She goes to bed early as she is very tired and pale

August 11, 2013 - Amy complains of chest pains when she gets up at 7am and she is taken to hospital by her mother Lynne, 50.

Her condition is initially described as stable, but she deteriorates and dies two days later.

In the time leading up to her death, she was described by her family as being ‘fit and well.'

But
at an inquest in Manchester her sister Sophie Wild, 23, said: 'On 
August 10 she was tired and very pale in colour and she went to bed 
early.

'Before she went to 
bed she was complaining of a bad back she had been suffering from for a 
few weeks beforehand. She got up at about 7am and went to wake mum up to
say she had chest pains. She hadn't complained of them before that 
morning.

'She said it felt 
like her heart was coming out of her chest. She was really out of breath
and she couldn't catch her breath so we took her to hospital in the car
at 9am.'

Amy was seen by the on-call cardiovascular team who prescribed beta blockers to slow her heart-rate down - but there was uncertainty over what exactly was causing the abnormal heart rate.

Treatment began for a lung clot and the possibility the body was rejecting the heart once more.

Her condition was initially described as stable, but she was prescribed medication to combat a rejection of the heart as a precautionary measure.

Heart transplant operations save lives - but there are often complications after surgery.

A common complication after surgery is rejection. The immune system – the body’s defence against infection – mistakes the transplanted heart as a foreign body and begins to attack it. This can often occur even if the patient is being treated with medication to suppress the immune system. There are two types of rejection - acute, which occurs just after surgery, and chronic, which happens months or years later.

One of the most serious complications that can occur after a heart transplant is that the donated heart fails to work and does not start beating, or stops beating soon after the surgery is completed.

This is known as primary graft dysfunction. It is the leading cause of death in the first 30 days after surgery and occurs in around 1 in 32 cases.

Infection is also common in the weeks after surgery when the immune system is weakened. In the years after surgery, many patients also suffer a narrowing of the arteries connected to the new heart.

Ahead of a planned biopsy, Amy went into sudden cardiac arrest and could not be revived.

Dr
Paul Bishop, a consultant histopathologist at Wythenshawe Hospital said
that as well as suffering from coronary artery disease, there was also 
evidence of significant rejection of the heart.

He
added: 'I was not surprised to find coronary artery disease ten years 
after a transplant and it's very difficult to do anything about this.'

Recording
a narrative verdict, coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'Despite the care and 
treatment which was afforded to her and given properly , the reason for 
her death was because of heart problems and known complications after a 
transplant.

'This was a 
tragic case of a young woman. She was just starting up her own business 
and until these problems in August it seemed as though things were going
well for her. But then suddenly you were faced with this terrible 
tragedy.

'When one hears a 
story such as this it really does bring mortality home to us. There are 
little words I can offer in way of sympathy for what you have gone 
through. None of this was expected. You had a fit young daughter who 
complained of these chest pains and in a couple of days she was taken 
from you.'

In a statement her mother Lynne, 50, said: 'Amy was just a girl who everybody loved. No one who met her would ever guess she was ill or what she'd been through because she was so full of energy and never took life too seriously.

'She was determined to live a normal life and there were times when I knew she was in a lot of pain but she'd never let me see it.'

Sophie added: 'We thought there would be more care for her on the day she passed - considering her heart condition and how poorly she had been. We are extremely unhappy with how she was dealt with on that day.'
