'Cruel': Lauren Bush, 17, allegedly taunted an autistic boy and filmed it on her cell phone

An autistic boy who allegedly endured months of abuse at the hands of two girls he called his friends said he wants the charges against them dropped.

Lauren Bush, 17, and another girl, 15, allegedly kicked the 16-year-old boy - a fellow classmate at Chopticon High School in Morganza, Maryland - in the groin, held a knife to his throat and tried to get him to have sex with his family's dog, all while they recorded him on their cell phones.

They also forced the boy to walk on a frozen lake, causing him to fall into freezing water several times while they did nothing to help, and on another occasion, they shaved off his eyebrows, according to records.

Still, the boy - who has only been identified by his middle name, Michael - considers Bush and the 15-year-old girl, who was his girlfriend, to be his friends.

'It really makes me upset that my parents want to see them in jail,' he told the Washington Post. 'Because I really like them.'

He said the girls never intended to kill him - even when they held a knife to his neck and led him to a frozen lake and persuaded him to fetch a basketball on the ice.

Minutes later, he fell through the ice and screamed, but the girls did nothing to help, he said. Afterwards, they wouldn't allow him to ride with them and he returned home wet.

'They put me in the trunk,' he said. 'They didn't want to get the interior wet.'

His parents, however, said they want Bush to be tried as an adult.

'My son is a staunch defender of his 
tormentors; itâ€™s embarrassing,' his father told the Post.

'He may be more disabled than I 
convinced myself that he was and maybe more lost than I realized. That's
 something I am going to have to deal with on a later day. Right now, I 
am trying to get justice for him and others like him.'

He added: 'Many of the attacks occurred 
at our home. If they hadn't been caught, I think they would have killed 
him or all of us.'

Michael told the Post he started going 
out with the younger girl last year after wooing her with notes, and 
that both of the girls knew he was autistic.

He tried to cover up the treatment, but his parents knew something was wrong when money started vanishing from his account, and it turned out he was taking the girls out every weekend.

The concerned parents called the school when their son returned home without any eyebrows - but officials said students weren't bullying him for the look - and eventually banned the boy from going out with the girls when his bank balance continued to dwindle.

Then on March 10, 
sheriff's deputies confiscated the younger girl's phone and both were arrested.

Their cruel treatment was uncovered after a fellow student heard about the videos and told school authorities.

Bush, 17, was charged as an adult with first-degree assault, false 
imprisonment and child-pornography solicitation, and faces up to 80 
years in prison if convicted.

She has been on house arrest, but on Monday she reported to state juvenile detention center for several 
weeks of psychological evaluation, the Post reported.

The
 Bushes hope the tests prove she should be tried as a juvenile, not an adult.

Donna and Larry Bush claim the boy is far smarter than the girls and that they never intended to seriously harm him. They insist their daughter is remorseful.

The 15-year-old was charged as a juvenile and earlier this month, she pleaded 
guilty to second-degree assault and displaying an 
obscene photograph. She remains in a juvenile detention center.

Sheriff Tim Cameron told ABC7 that the allegations leveled against the girls are among the most disturbing he has dealt with in his career.

Police say the girls have admitted to videotaping the incidents, but officials are still trying to figure out why.

'Who
 could harbor this ill will to do something so completely heinous?' said
 Cameron. 'I don't know. It's hard to fathom, really.'
