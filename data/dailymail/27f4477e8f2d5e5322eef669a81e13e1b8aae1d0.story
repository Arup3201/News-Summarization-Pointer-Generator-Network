Arsene Wenger has launched a scathing attack on fifth officials, insisting he does not know what they are paid for.

Arsenal manager Wenger queried their role after replays  indicated Anthony Vanden Borre's first goal for Anderlecht was offside in the Champions League clash at the Emirates.

Wenger admits UEFA have explained the use of the fifth official to him, but he believes he's not alone in struggling to see the benefit of having them.

'Every time we go to Geneva, (Pierluigi) Collina (UEFA's chief refereeing officer) explains to us that the fifth referee is a fantastic finding.

'But when you see the pictures of the first goal, it is unbelievable. A guy stands behind the line in front of the offside guy and does not stay a word.

'I do not know what the guys behind the line are paid for. That is a general feeling shared by everyone who watches football. They should buy a seat for them, and give them a good book!'
