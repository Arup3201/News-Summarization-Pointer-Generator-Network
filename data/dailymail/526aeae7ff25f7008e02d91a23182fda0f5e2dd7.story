Ian Poulter has slammed Sir Nick Faldo for calling Sergio Garcia ‘useless’ during the Ryder Cup and claimed he has lost the respect of Europe’s top golfers.

Poulter revealed the home locker room was fuming about the remark and said Faldo had gone from being his hero to zero. He accused him of sour grapes and being embittered because he is the only losing European Ryder Cup captain this century.

The colourful Englishman made his strong remarks in his autobiography ‘No Limits,’ released this week.

The demand for a fleeting moment of television fame is partly responsible for the deterioration in crowd behaviour at Ryder Cups, claims Ian Poulter.

'Guys are trying to get themselves heard on TV – that’s what it is. It’s somebody thinking, I am going to go to a golf tournament today and I’m going to shout ‘Me nan wears pants’. It’s really not very clever.'

Poulter is highly critical of American crowds after Europe’s Ryder Cup victory at Medinah. He says: 'I’m all for atmosphere in golf and the crowd getting involved, but there’s a line to be tread and occasionally things are said too early.'

He describes someone yelling 'Get in the hole' on a 500-yard par five as 'very stupid'. He suggests: 'Hit the fairway' would be more helpful but the bray 'Baba booey' has no relevance. The most mystifying unrelated golf shout is 'mashed potato'.

Poulter warns: 'If you are concentrating on a shot and someone screams on your backswing, it is off-putting. It has the potential to affect the outcome of a match or tournament.'

Faldo, in his capacity as an American television commentator, was asked during the first day of the Ryder Cup about Garcia and referred back to his own time as captain in 2008, saying the Spaniard had had a ‘bad attitude’ and had been ‘useless’.

Faldo claimed later the remark was in ‘semi-jest’ before conceding that ‘useless’ had been a poor choice of word. ‘“Lousy” would have been better,’ he added.

Garcia was ill at Valhalla in 2008 and also love-sick after splitting from his long-term girlfriend, Greg Norman’s daughter Morgan-Leigh. In his book, Poulter takes up the story at Gleneagles from the players’ perspective. They are buzzing after a brilliant fightback in the afternoon foursomes to take a 5-3 first day lead.

‘There is only one negative,’ writes Poulter. ‘At the press conference, it emerges Nick Faldo has been heavily critical of Sergio Garcia. He has said Sergio had a bad attitude when he played under Nick in the 2008 Ryder Cup and that he was “useless” there.

‘Sergio puts a brave face on it but the rest of the guys are fuming. I’m shocked that he has said it. It’s highly disrespectful. It’s a cheap shot and it’s the worst possible timing.

‘It makes me laugh. Faldo is talking about someone being useless at the 2008 Ryder Cup. That’s the Ryder Cup where he was captain. That’s the Ryder Cup where the Europe team suffered a heavy defeat.

‘And he was captain. So who’s useless? Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror. I have always got on great with Faldo in the past and I have a great deal of respect for everything he has achieved but this feels like sour grapes. It feels like a guy who is still bitter that he lost in 2008.

‘Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said. There were plenty of things a lot of the players were unhappy with at Valhalla but none of us criticised him. He may find that begins to change now.’

Faldo is not the only captain who comes under fire. Some of American skipper Tom Watson’s strange decisions come under scrutiny.

‘By the end of the second day we have a 10-6 lead,’ says Poulter. ‘Ecstatic as we are, quite a few of us are surprised by Watson’s decision-making during Saturday’s play. Most of all I’m astonished he does not play Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley.

‘He leaves them out of both sessions. It completely baffles me. It gives us a double boost because it tells us there are problems in the US team room.

‘Watson’s choices mean seven of his players play 36 holes on Saturday. I find it hard to see the sense in that. Some of them look shattered and Paul McGinley’s strategy starts to pay off. We’re fresh. We keep coming at them. Wave after wave after wave.’

Poulter talks about partnering home hero Stephen Gallacher against Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed on the opening morning and admits he was not cut out for the role of big brother. ‘I find it hard taking on the responsibility of helping a rookie,’ he says. ‘I’m nervous, too. I want to win for him as much as myself and the team but we get humped 5&4.’

Poulter played the following morning alongside Rory McIlroy. At the 15th hole, the Ryder Cup finally gets its first taste of that old Poulter magic as he chips in for a birdie to win the hole and help secure a half against Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler.

He admits he was disappointed not to partner his old mate Justin Rose in the afternoon foursomes.

‘Paul has decided to go with Martin (Kaymer) and tells me if I had made that chip shot 15 minutes earlier I’d have been playing,’ he says.
