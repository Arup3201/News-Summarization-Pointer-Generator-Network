A man who was the sole survivor of a massacre at his family's home had actually plotted the murders with a family friend - before killing him and fingering him as the killer, prosecutors have said.

Ryan Champion, 36, was indicted in Trigg County, Kentucky on Wednesday for the murder of Vito Riservato, 22, and on three counts of complicity to commit murder for the deaths of his parents and sister.

The bodies of his parents, Lindsey Champion, 62, and Joy Champion, 60, and his 31-year-old veterinarian sister Emily Champion were found last month at the family's rural home in Cadiz.

Riservato's body was also found in the home, and all four died of gunshot wounds.

After Ryan Champion was released from hospital following the killings, he told WSMV-TV that Riservato entered the home and started shooting but that he 'was able to turn the tables' on him.

'He got close enough to me that I could turn the tables, and that was it,' he claimed. 'Every minute the entire thing was going on, that's all I was waiting for. I was waiting for an opportunity.'

But prosecutors said on Wednesday that was not what happened - and Champion had actually enlisted Riservato's help and then killed him.

Commonwealth's Attorney G.L. Ovey, the top prosecutor in Trigg County, said it started out as a murder-for-hire scheme, but 'it didn't end up that way'.

'In a murder for hire, he would've got paid, but... he was murdered,' Ovey said.

Ovey, who said he will seek the death penalty for Champion, would not speculate on what Ryan Champion's motives were in the deaths of his parents.

He worked as a contractor in town and had recently been evicted from his apartment. 

Hours after the four bodies were found spread across the Champions' horse farm on October 26, police named Riservato as the suspect.    

But his friends and family said that the young father could never have been responsible for the horrific crimes.

'Anyone who knew Vito knows he's not a killer,' his ex-girlfriend Bekah Kuser said on Facebook. 'He was a loving father and a good friend.

'I don't want his name to be tarnished just because someone can't own up to what they have done, its so sad how someone has to pin it on someone who is no longer with us.'

In his TV interview, Ryan Champion claimed he was spared because the killer did not see him as a threat. He declined to elaborate further on the killings, citing the ongoing police investigation. 

He also told media outlets that he had only met Riservato once before the killings, and posted updates on Facebook after the slayings, saying he had survived and was recuperating.

Champion later posted that he was in need of money and looking for odd jobs to pay for bills and gas after the tragedy.

Emily Champion was in Cadiz for a short visit, and a kidnapping charge against Ryan Champion pertains to her. Ovey said she was restrained by duct tape during the attack.

She was a veterinarian at Baronne Veterinary Clinic in Sunset, Louisiana. She had been visiting her parents in Kentucky during time off after getting a new job.

She graduated from Auburn University's college of veterinary medicine in 2008 and practiced at Delta Downs racetrack in Vinton, Louisiana.

Joy Champion was a retired teacher who taught for 30 years at schools in Trigg County.  

Champion is due back in court for an arraignment on December 10. He is being held in the Christian County Jail on a $5 million bond.
