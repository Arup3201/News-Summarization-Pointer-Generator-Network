Thousands of screaming fans mobbed Chelsea star Didier Drogba as he carried the Olympic flame through Swindon this afternoon.

The footballer waved at supporters as he jogged through the town centre with the torch and many of those who turned out to see him were wearing Chelsea shirts.

Drogba emerged from the pedestrianised Market Street where fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of the star.

The footballer, who was the 84th torchbearer of the day, ran down Commercial Road in Swindon's bustling shopping district.

Mobbed: Many turned out to see the footballer who, yesterday, announced he would be leaving Chelsea

Running man: The footballer, who was the 84th torchbearer of the day, ran down Commercial Road in Swindon's bustling shopping district

The road was turned into a sea of blue, red and white from the hundreds of Union flags, balloons and football shirts.

Drogba was flanked by police and security as he handed over the flame to Stephen Ratcliffe, chairman of Newlands Park, a community multi-sport venue owned by Cheltenham Rugby Club.

As the two torches touched, spectators ran towards Drogba to get a photo of the footballer. He was then quickly whisked through the crowd into a silver car and driven away.

While the footballer was whisked away, there was drama shortly after he had passed the torch on when a 16-year-old youth attempted to grab the flame as it passed.

The teenager was rugby-tackled by a security guard after getting within 2ft of the torch as it made its way down Great Western Way in the town.

The youth was then bundled into the crowd before he was chased down the street and detained by officers at the scene.

A spokesman for the force revealed he was not arrested - but taken home to his parents and given a word of advice.

Eyewitness Shauni Iles, 20, who wasÂ  watching the relay with sister Maddie, six, looked on in horror as the Olympic flame was almost seized by the rampaging yob.

The sociology student, from Swindon, said: 'The guy came from the left of me and ran out into the road - he got about two-feet from the torch.

'But a security guard tackled him and threw him back into the crowd - narrowly missing my sister. He landed on top of a four-year-old child.

'He then tried to run off but was eventually caught by police and arrested. It was a really shocking thing to witness - the torch was under attack.'

Drogba, who plays for the Ivory Coast striker, scored the equaliser and then the winning penalty in Saturday's dramatic Champions League final win over Bayern Munich, announced yesterday he was quitting Chelsea to pursue his career elsewhere.

He departs Stamford Bridge with his reputation as one of the club's greatest players firmly intact, but he knows it could have been so much different.

Ever since the 34-year-old joined the club from Marseille in 2004 they have been chasing the European Cup and, after so many near misses, Drogba's final kick for them earned them the prize they coveted.

Had he not have scored and had Bayern gone on to win, he admits he may have been tempted to stay but, with all his loose ends tied up, he is moving on to a new chapter.

Long way to go: After arriving it he UK last Friday, the Olympic Flame is now on day five of its 70-day relay

Speaking to Radio 5 Live, he said: 'I think winning the game was the key. Not me scoring the penalty.

'Winning the game was the turning point, that's why I have decided to say goodbye.

'We made the story together and I want people to remember that. This is the best time to move on.

'Yes, there's a chance that if the result was different, maybe I would be here.

'We were talking for many weeks, but the turning point was based on the fact I won everything I could and scored in most of the finals we have played, trying to make a difference.

'I hope everyone will understand. Everything I did was for the fans and I hope they understand.'

Earlier today, the Olympic torch took a wrong turn in Bristol, delaying the relay by 10 minutes.

However, once the convoy got back on track it sparked a spectacular fireworks display as the torchbearer passed over the city's iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge.

The torch left the foggy streets of Bristol for North Somerset at 5.50am before travelling by convoy to visit Nailsea, Backwell and Flax Bourton.

But as it returned to Bristol via Nailsea the convoy took a wrong turn in Failand.

Proud procession: Margaret Glastonbury with the torch. Tens of thousands of people had lined the streets of Bristol to catch a glimpse of the flame

Tens of thousands of people had lined the streets of Bristol to catch a glimpse of the flame.

Clifton Suspension Bridge was left suspiciously empty but all became clear when Rebecca Pantaney stepped on to the Grade I-listed structure and the loud bang of fireworks was heard.

Ms Pantaney won badminton gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games as part of the women's team.Gasps could be heard from the crowd as people cheered and waved Union Flags.

The display followed the torchbearer as she ran across the bridge to loud applause from spectators.

The flame was handed over on the middle of the bridge, which was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, to Thomas Baker.

A Locog (London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) spokesman said that when the mistake was made no torchbearers were running and the relay was in 'convoy mode'.

They added: 'They missed a turning this morning between Nailsea and Failand. They realised straight away and rectified it.

'They were running 10 minutes late. It did not impact on any of the torchbearers.

'It was in convoy travelling from Nailsea to Failand.'
