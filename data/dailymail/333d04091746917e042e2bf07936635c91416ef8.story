A Tacoma, Washington mother who sent sexually explicit texts to a 14-year-old boy in an attempt to lure him into bed has been jailed for nine months.

But the sentence was not enough for the victim's mum who said the 37 year old, Shakira Anderson, got off lightly and showed no remorse.

'I don't think she's mentally stable and I don't think it will change the way she behaves', said the boy's mother.

Sharia Anderson, 37, will only be serving nine months behind bars for texting her daughter's 15 ex-boyfriend

Her husband added that he was glad they found out about Anderson's inappropriate behavior before their son had sex with her.

Speaking after seeing Anderson jailed, the father said: 'It's anger, it's frustration.Â  There's even a little relief that we actually caught it before anything bad happened.'

He said Anderson still poses a threat to other underage boys.

'I don't think there's going to be any change with her. I think in the future she's going to be at risk when she's back out.'

The father declined to be named to avoid his son's identity being revealed.

A court in Tacoma, Washington, heard that Anderson began texting the teen after he broke up with her daughter.

She repeatedly sent him sexually explicit text messages while trying to convince him to have sex with her.

The boy's parents found the text messages on his cell phone and alerted police.

The boy's mother, who did not want to show her face or reveal her identity, said that she didn't think the woman was given a long enough sentence

Anderson pleaded guilty to communicating with a minor for immoral purposes in January.

At the sentencing Pierce County Superior Court Judge Frank Cuthbertson lectured Anderson telling her the investigation into her behavior showed she didn't take the charges seriously and didn't consider herself a sex offender.

'Kids are not to be played with,' said Cuthbertson.

'They are not toys, they are human beings.'

Anderson asked to be allowed to serve half of her nine-month jail sentence on electronic home monitoring.

Judge Cuthbertson denied her request and ordered her to undergo a psychosexual evaluation while she is in jail.
