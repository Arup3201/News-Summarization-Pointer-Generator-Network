Torrential rains from a tropical storm flooded large swathes of the Philippine capital and outlying provinces today, leaving three dead and displacing tens of thousands.

Schools and government offices were shut in Manila as the Fung-Wong storm raged and authorities said thousands were evacuated from severely inundated communities, where rapidly flowing waters swirled neck-high in places.

Radio stations reported residents taking shelter in the second floor of homes where the water had reached the ceiling of the ground floor.

Flooded streets caused traffic gridlock across the city of 12 million, with many motorists and other commuters unaware of the extent of the flooding due to a lack of reports from local authorities.

Manila airport authorities said the rains and radar problems caused delays and the cancellation of at least 28 domestic flights to and from northern and central Philippines. At least three international flights heading to Manila were diverted to Clark International Airport in northern Pampanga province.

Thousands of ferry passengers were stranded after services were cancelled and the coastguard also stopped fishing boats from going to sea. 

Presidential spokeswoman Abigal Valte said that work in government offices in the capital and 15 other provinces has been suspended.

The Philippine Stock Exchange suspended trading and some banks sent their employees home by noon.

Weather forecaster Dioni Sarmiento said more than ten inches of rain fell over a part of Metro Manila used as a rainfall gauge over a 24-hour period ending early today. That was more than half of the amount of rain that caused massive flooding across the sprawling metropolis of 12 million people in 2009.

Just last week, Typhoon Kalmaegi ravaged the same area, leaving eight people dead and displacing more than 366,000.

Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said some parts of the capital were flooded overnight and residents in a number of slum communities were evacuated to safety.

But he added that floodwaters were receding because major drainage pipes had been cleared of thrash before the rainy season. He did not say how many have been evacuated in the city.

'Our anti-flood infrastructure has been neglected for a long time,' Estrada said. 'You go abroad and you see big houses of the rich along clean rivers. But here, the riverbanks teem with squatter colonies, which don't have septic tanks and treat the river like a garbage can.' 

Zharina Biong, a staffer of the disaster management unit of Marikina City, part of Metro Manila, said more than 27,000 people, most of them living near the swollen Marikina river, have been evacuated since dawn today.

'We are now on sweeping operations for those trapped by the floods. The rains were so heavy, so fast, some were not able to evacuate,' De Guzman said in an interview with GMA TV, adding the government was sending amphibious vehicles and boats to help get people out.

Disaster agency officials said two other Manila districts were flooded and they were monitoring a dam, which was nearly full.

The storm, which packed gusts of wind up to 62 miles per hour made landfall in northern Cagayan province around noon today. It was expected to leave Philippine territory by Sunday and make a sharp turn northward toward Taiwan and southern Japan.
