Tracked down: Police caught Shawn Custis after releasing an old mug shot of the suspected home invader

The suspected robber caught on a nanny cam as he pushed a mother to the floor and beat her in front of her child has been arrested.

Convicted robber Shawn Custis was arrested in Manhattan hours after police released an old mug shot of him to the public.

The 42-year-old now faces charges of attempted murder, robber, burglarly and child endangerment, and is being held on $750,000 bail.

Custis, who was released from prison 
in December, where he was serving a sentence for burglaries in New 
Jersey, is believed to be the man behind the vicious assault on the 
woman in her Milburn, New Jersey home.

Camera
 footage shows the sickening attack, which took place as the woman's 
terrified three-year-old daughter cowered on the sofa and her baby boy 
slept upstairs.

Police say they identified the convicted robber from the nanny cam images, according to the Daily News.

The
 woman and her daughter were watching morning cartoons on the couch when
 bolted front door was kicked in and the helpless mother was savagely 
attacked.

The woman said she was afraid to cry out in case it made her daughter scream, which would anger her attacker, NBC4 said.
