Spain's Interior Ministry has come under fire for a crime prevention campaign in which all the burglars are black... but attempted to defend itself by saying it was inspired by the Three Wise Men.

The safety warning was criticised by anti-racism campaigners and opposition politicians after a series of posters warning against burglars only featured figures with black faces.

In one of the posters three of the figures can be seen riding on a camel, while another shows what appears to be a woman with a black face, arms and legs carrying a bag of  money.

The Spanish Interior Ministry has defended itself against allegations of racism by saying a poster campaign in which all the burglars are black was inspired in part by the Three Wise Men

The ministry has attempted to dismiss the allegations by saying the characters are wearing balaclavas - but their argument failed to impress critics who pointed out the characters also had black hands and legs

The ministry has attempted to dismiss the allegations by saying the characters had been wearing balaclavas.

Their argument failed to impress critics however who pointed out the characters also had black hands and legs.

Asked why in one poster the characters were riding on a camel, the ministry claimed in a written statement that the picture was a play on the image of the Three Kings who in this case were not bringing gifts, but were coming to rob the house.

The ministry said: 'The image is not actually of the Three Kings with black skin but three criminals in balaclavas.

The posters, which have been put up across the country, have also come under fire from Spain's main opposition party, the socialist PSOE

One of the posters shows a character in a grey suit, which was said by critics to be a burkha-wearing burglar

'We want to warn people that crooks could try to pass themselves off as something legitimate to try and rob people's homes.'

Ruyan Torres Veliz, from the Spanish Youth Against Racism, said: 'As well as not explaining why these people had black hands and feet, including the woman in a dress, it should be pointed out to the Interior Ministry that it isn't Christmas which is usually the time the Three Kings are out in force.'

The posters, that have been put up across the country, have also come under fire from Spain's main opposition party, the socialist PSOE.

A party spokesman said: 'The association is clear, if you are burglar, you are black.'
