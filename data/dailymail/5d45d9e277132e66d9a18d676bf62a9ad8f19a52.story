NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and his officers were sprayed with  fake blood while walking among demonstrators protesting against the grand jury decision in the Ferguson shooting.

The commissioner was left with the red liquid splattered across his face, after a protester threw a bag of the fake blood at him and his entourage in Times Square, New York.

Another officer was hit by the red liquid, which was seen covering his face and shirt as the surrounding crowd scattered.

Diego Ibanez, 26, is expected to appear in court on Tuesday after he was arrested for allegedly throwing the blood.

Mr Ibanez, who is originally from Bolivia, is a onetime Occupy Wall Street protester, according to the Daily News.

Several thousand people had marched from Union Square to Times Square to protest a grand jury's decision not to indict the white police officer who shot dead 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

Police told CBS2 they were aware of the incident involving Commissioner Bratton, but could not immediately confirm any information. There were several arrests and an unspecified number of police officers had suffered minor injuries.

A few hours before the grand jury decision on Monday night, another group of protesters had gathered outside NYU Law School where Bratton was speaking. 

The New Yorkers Against Bratton are calling for the commissioner's resignation, after an NYPD officer shot and killed a man in a public housing stairwell in Brooklyn last week.

Akai Gurley, 28, was shot and killed in a darkened stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York on Thursday night by officer Peter Liang as he conducted a floor-by-floor sweep of the building.

Bratton called the shooting a tragic accident and said Gurley was a 'total innocent'. He said Mr Gurley had lost his life because of a 'coincidence'. 

There is also fury over the case of Staten Island man Eric Garner, 43, who died in July after cops put him in a chokehold while he yelled 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe'.

The incident, in which he was surrounded by five officers who claimed to have seen him selling untaxed cigarettes on the street, was all caught on a cellphone video camera.

The grand jury is still hearing evidence on his case.

'The lives of people of color, young black men of color, young women of color, poor people - they are not respected and valued by the NYPD,' Josmar Truillo from New Yorkers Against Bratton told the Huffington Post.

'Connecting the dots between Brooklyn, Staten island and Ferguson is exactly what the mayor of this city does not want us to do and that's something we must make sure happens,' he added, noting that Mayor Bill de Blasio  said that Gurley's death should not be compared to other instances of alleged police brutality.

Protesters demonstrating the grand jury decision in New York held up signs reading 'Black lives matter' and 'Jail killer cops,' and chanted 'Hands up, don't shoot' and 'No justice, no peace' as they walked to Times Square.

Traffic on New York City bridges was  shut down as demonstrators marched in traffic lanes over the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Triboro bridges.

Activists had been planning to protest even before the night-time announcement that Officer Darren Wilson will not be charged in the shooting death of Michael Brown. 

The racially charged case in Ferguson has inflamed tensions and reignited debates over police-community relations even in cities hundreds of miles from the predominantly black St. Louis suburb.

Police departments in several major cities said they were bracing for large demonstrations with the potential for the kind of violence that marred nightly protests in Ferguson after Brown's killing. 

Demonstrators there vandalized police cars, hugged barricades and taunted officers with expletives Monday night while police fired smoke canisters and pepper spray. Gunshots were heard on the streets.

But police elsewhere reported that gatherings were mostly peaceful immediately following Monday's announcement.  

Other signs included pictures of both Michael Brown and Eric Garner, the local Staten Island man who died in July after being put in a choke hold by police during an arrest.

Protesters were penned in an area at the northern end of the square, behind a ring of police officers. They pushed the metal police barriers aside and yelled, 'No justice, no peace, no racist police.'
