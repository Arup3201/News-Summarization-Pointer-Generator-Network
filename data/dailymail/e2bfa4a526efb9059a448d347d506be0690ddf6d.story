The obligatory ballgown and bikini round for the Miss Universe 2013 competition took place at Crocus Hall in Moscow, Russia, yesterday.

And judging by the way she worked it on the catwalk, Miss Great Britain, 21-year-old Amy Willerton, has to be a frontrunner for the crown. She showed off her incredibly toned body in a spangly red string bikini, before sashaying on stage in a strapless lilac evening gown with a sweeping fishtail.

The Bristolian is one of 85 contestants 
competing for the coveted Miss Universe crown.

During the first part of the show, the swimsuit section, the women showed off killer bodies - they've obviously been putting in the hours at the gym pre-pageant. They all wore exactly the same towering nude platform heels with their bikinis, presumably at the organisers' request.

Next, spangles and sequins - plus big hair and even bigger smiles - were the order of the day for the ballgown round.

USA's Erin Brady - whose unusual Optimus Prime outfit in the national costumes round was much discussed earlier in the week - played it safe but sexy in a vampish strapless red number with plunging neckline, sequins and embroidery.

Contestants appeared in the 
National Costumes Show earlier in the week, the first in a series of events leading up to 
the final of the Miss Universe pageant which concludes on November 9 in Krasnogorsk, Russia. 

Last year's winner, the USA's Olivia Culpo, will be on hand to pass on her crown while the judging panel includes American former model Carol Alt, South African fashion designer Marc Bouwer and Aerosmith frontman, Steve Tyler.

As Miss Universe, Culpo won an undisclosed salary, a wardrobe fit for
 a queen, a limitless supply of beauty products, and a luxury apartment 
in New York City.

To compete, contestants must be at least 18 and under
 27 years old to compete in the Miss Universe or Miss USA competitions. 
They may not be married or pregnant.
