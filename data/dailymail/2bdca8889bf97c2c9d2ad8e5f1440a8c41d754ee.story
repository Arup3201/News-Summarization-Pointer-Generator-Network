Thanks to a judge in Southern California who today overruled a request to shutdown the factory that produces Srirarcha, you can continue your masochistic relationship with the hot sauce - for now.

The City of Irwindale filed a lawsuit on Monday against Huy Fong Foods, citing several residents in the area claiming that the odor from the facility was burning their eyes, irritating their throats, and causing headaches. They say it's so strong that some have had to leave their houses to escape the 'smell'. 

But the judge rejected the city's request for a temporary retraining order to halt production at the factory and instead set a hearing for November 22 to discuss whether the factory should shut down to address the odor complaints.

Turned down: A judge in Southern California refused the City of Irwindale's request to temporarily shut down the Sriracha factory in order to address complaints about the odor

Complaints: Residents of the City of Irwindale who live around the factory have been complaining about the smell - saying that the odor burns their eyes, makes their throats itch and causes headaches

'It's rather edgy,' Judge Robert H. O'Brien said. 'You're asking for a very radical order on a 24-hour notice. You probably should have come in earlier.'

Judge O'Brien's ruling was a big win for the hot sauce company. It's currently peak chili harvesting season, and they do most of their work between September and December.

Huy Fong initially cooperated with the city, but talks broke down last week after company representatives denied there was an odor problem, saying their employees worked in similar olfactory settings without complaint, Mr Galante said.

Going forward: But the company isn't out of the clear yet. The judge set up a hearing for November 22 to discuss further whether to shut down the factory while the odor issue is addressed

The city, which is about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, is seeking closure of the factory until Huy Fong submits a plan to minimize the smell.

'If they fix it and the odor problems stop, we don't need this order; but so far the odor complaints continue,' Mr Galante said.

The company's lawyer, John R Tate, said that they had installed odor air-quality regulators to address the issue and that shutting down the factory would prevent the analysis from being completed.

Air quality experts have been brought in and their initial reports found that there was no detectable aroma 209 feet from the exhaust system. They only places where they noticed an odor was in the lobby (rated 1 on a scale of 10) and near the exhaust hood over where the chilies are ground (rated 3).

Huy Fong Foods' owner David Tran pointed out that the smell is part of what makes his product so popular, and that shutting the factory impacts the consumer more than the producer.

'If it doesn't smell, we can't sell,' he told the Los Angeles Times . 'If the city shuts us down, the price of Sriracha will jump a lot.'

Huy Fong's green-capped chili bottles are hugely popular and are a fixture in restaurants and pantries around the world.

The first Sriracha Festival held in downtown Los Angeles over the weekend drew hundreds of fans.

Tran was there sporting a T-shirt that said 'I put Sriracha on my Sriracha.'

The company had operated out of two buildings in nearby Rosemead since the late 1980s until it opened large factory in Irwindale this year.
