Four inmates – including one jailed for his part in a killing and another who committed robbery with a chainsaw – have gone on the run from one of Britain's least secure prisons.

The men absconded from the category D Sudbury open prison over the weekend.

Three inmates walked out on Saturday though staff only noticed they were missing when they carried out a roll call that evening. The fourth left on Sunday.

One of the men, a 33-year-old burglar, was recaptured by police in the West Midlands on Sunday.

Killer Brett Frewin, left, who escaped from Sudbury, was among a gang of four who left father of three Tushar Makwana (right) for dead after he tried to stop them stealing a car.

But burglar Warren Bamford, robber 
Christopher Price and Brett Frewin, who killed a father of three in a 
bungled burglary, were still at large last night.

Despite being classified as fit to be held at an open prison, police have warned the public they should not approach the men.

HMP Sudbury open prison has endured a string of problems in recent years.

Last February a prison inmate turned an empty office into a major drugs factory - while out on day release from the jail on 'work experience.'

In 2008 it was alleged prostitutes were being smuggled into Sudbury to spend the night with inmates.

In September 2007, convicted murderer Raymond Kennedy escaped from the prison, becoming the 48th to go on the run that year.

And last month burglars cut their way through a perimeter fence at HMP Sudbury Prison in Derbyshire before wrenching open the door of a workshop and making off with £1,000 of tools.

Detectives say all the men have 
connections to the West Midlands and officers are investigating if they 
colluded over their escape.

Police are appealing for information about their whereabouts, but say people should not approach them.

Frewin was one of four teenagers jailed for killing award-winning DJ Tushar Makwana.

The 37-year-old Heart FM presenter 
suffered fatal head injuries when he tried to stop the quartet escaping 
in a stolen car after he disturbed three of them breaking into his home.

Leicester Crown Court heard the vehicle, a Citroen C5, was used 'like a weapon' to brush Mr Makwana off after the burglary at his house in Castle Bromwich, in February, 2004.

Three of the gang kicked down his front door, with the aim of stealing keys to his BMW parked outside.

But Mr Makwana, who was barefoot and wearing only a dressing gown, chased the trio to their getaway car, where the driver was waiting.

He tried to get inside the Citroen but the vehicle sped off and Mr Makwana fell, suffering a fractured skull and brain swelling. He died in hospital three days later.

Frewin, now 24, was jailed for 10 years for manslaughter and burglary in 2004.

He is white, 5ft 9in and slim with short brown hair, brown eyes and a Birmingham accent. His last known address was in Castle Vale, Birmingham.

Price, now 26, was part of a four-strong Birmingham gang who raided a shop armed with a chainsaw and a knife.

A grandmother was working alone behind the counter when the masked gang stormed in and shoved her out of the way.

She managed to push a panic button but the gang took £100 from a till before fleeing in a stolen car. Price admitted robbery and was jailed for five years and six months in 2009.

He is white, 5ft 10in and of medium build with short brown hair, blue eyes. His last known address was in Yardley, Birmingham.

Bamford, 34, was jailed for six years in 2009 for burglary. He is white, 6ft 3in with receding ginger hair and blue eyes. His last known address was in Bromsgrove.

Sudbury, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, holds 580 inmates, but it has been plagued by prisoner break-outs.

Fifty inmates absconded from the jail between October 2007 to March 2009.

That figure was less than half the number who went on the run in the previous 18-month period, when 106 prisoners gave guards the slip.
