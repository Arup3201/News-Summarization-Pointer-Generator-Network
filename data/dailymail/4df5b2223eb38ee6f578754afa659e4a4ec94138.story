After Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris and the abuse of young, vulnerable women in Bradford, you’d be forgiven for thinking there has been a sea change. That any man who transgresses against a woman will be stopped; that women will finally be believed; that we can trust the judicial system. My experience over the past two very difficult and distressing years proves the opposite is true.

When I bought my house in October 2012 in the breathtakingly beautiful Yorkshire Dales, with a cottage on site for my assistant/ animal behaviourist, Nic, who has worked for me for seven years, I thought we would be able to live in peace.

The caretaker had warned me as he left the property about the farmer next door, saying he and the farmer had been at it ‘hammer and tongs’ for years.

The farmer, Jamie Close, who lives alone, is 43, and deaf and partially dumb. Being profoundly deaf myself, I immediately empathised.

As two single women in a remote area, Nic and I keep our counsel. We don’t really socialise, as neither of us have time.

As single women, even going to the pub can be misconstrued.

But living just 500 yards from Jamie’s farm, we tried to be polite good, helpful neighbours, and at first we all got on OK.

I rented one of his fields for my horses, at a cost of £3,000 a year. Nic quickly learned sign language and would help Jamie out by phoning people on his behalf. When Jamie’s dog was run over, Nic took it to the vet, and phoned them daily for updates.

But it being a small rural area, where locals know everything about each other, we soon learned that Jamie had been cautioned not long before we moved in for stalking his ex-girlfriend, who had moved out of the area to avoid him, so we made sure to lock our doors. We had moved unwittingly into an already volatile situation.

And then, in the summer of 2013, the abuse of Nic started. It was harmless, if creepy, at first.

Jamie began to spy on her; we would catch him looking out of his window – we are the only two properties on our dead-end lane – just standing, staring.

And then the stalking took on a sexual nature. He started to bombard Nic with bizarrely worded, obscene text messages such as ‘I want you, together love cuddle’, ‘ready hard play sex’ and ‘Want love sex, b*** job’.

The sexual stuff was never aimed at me; he often made the sign for ‘old woman’ at me, by dragging two fingers down his face from his eyes, indicating bags and lines.

If a male friend posted anything on Nic’s Facebook page, Jamie would shout: ‘Die! Die! Die!’ He said if Nic married him, she could have money; if she refused, she must ‘f*** off!’, and I must leave.

‘You!’ he said to me. ‘Go south!’

He even erected a For Sale sign in my garden.

One weekend, he placed a sex toy on Nic’s doorstep. He painted the word ‘Witch’ on the side of my barn. He placed a dead rabbit on her doorstep. He would pin notes to our doors, accusing Nic of liking young boys, and to me he scrawled just two words: ‘Finished you.’ Every time a note appeared, I got chest pains.

He would get back to his farm late at night, having been drinking, and bang on Nic’s front door. He would appear in my hallway uninvited. He made our lives in this seemingly idyllic, tranquil location, a living hell.

Nic understandably became depressed, and was put on medication. She was too scared to leave her cottage, which was tricky, as her job is to look after animals. She threatened to kill herself.

Finally, she went to see Jamie’s sister, who lives four miles away. Nic didn’t want to involve the police, as Jamie obviously needed help.

The sister said she was afraid the situation would escalate, and that her brother would never change, but she would talk to him.

Meanwhile his mother said she was scared of him, as he once went for his ex-girlfriend with a pitchfork in front of her. But nonetheless his mother, when I asked for her help, also told me I should sell my house, as ‘we were here first’.

Nothing changed. Nic went to the family again. This time, the sister called the police. After many hours of taking statements, the police, who to their credit were endlessly sympathetic and helpful, gave Jamie a harassment notice.

They told us to get walkie-talkies (there is scant mobile signal in our area), but what use I’d be to Nic against a man who is 22st and over 6ft, I’ve no idea.

And of course he persisted with the stalking and the harassment, and so finally, last month, he was arrested and released on bail. A date for a court hearing was set.

We discovered Jamie had in fact been cautioned before for a very similar offence, and so it seemed likely he would receive a custodial sentence, or be made to relocate. When Nic and I were told this, we said to each other: How will six months in prison help him? He will just be released and do it again.

In court last Monday, Jamie pleaded guilty. And the sentence? He was ordered to pay £100 and given a restraining order.

One hundred pounds. That is less than I was fined for speeding. In court, his defence lawyer stated that ‘there’s a certain economy of words in the deaf community that outsiders can find brutally frank’. I think those texts were very, very clear.

Liz said Jamie Close appeared in court last Monday for stalking and harassment and received a £100 fine

To top it all, I’ve just received a letter from the family’s solicitor, saying I am not to talk to Jamie because ‘he is a vulnerable adult handicapped by his inability to hear, he is easily harmed and the harm can be reflected in his behaviour’.

To me, this clearly implies that his two latest victims are in fact responsible! There has been no apology, and our horses now face eviction from his field.

If Nic was to do what Jamie’s ex did, and move away, she’d lose her job. We thought about renting her a cottage in a nearby village, but she feels he would only find her again.

I have only ever waved hello to him, given him a cheery thumbs-up for slowing his tractor when I am walking my dogs, and ordered him pizza after a hard day’s sheep shearing.

Making excuses for and underestimating his behaviour is unhelpful to all involved; and as a vulnerable adult, surely he shouldn’t be living with barely any human contact?

And what about my employee? She is a vulnerable adult: she is depressed and often here alone, as I have to travel to work.

Liz said that Jamie Close's family said that she could sell her house was they 'were here first'

Giving Jamie a restraining order is a joke. He ignored the last one. Even last week he has been ducking behind his Land Rover, spying on Nic. In our rare lighter moments, Nic will joke, as she heads outside in a floor-length coat and hat, wellies, no make-up, hair scragged back, ‘Could I be any less attractive?’ Even a burka is no defence against male fantasy.

Men who abuse women are often victims, too. Jamie has no boundaries: he even asked Nic what type of tampon she uses, and her method of contraception. He was set up, alone, in a remote farm 20 years ago, which to me seems the worst possible solution for a man already isolated by his disability.

We of course don’t want the disabled in care homes or hospitals or institutions, but to leave them on their own, to prey on an unsuspecting neighbour? What ever happened to the maiden aunt or bachelor uncle living with their family? Care in the community is clearly a joke.

We have a stereotypical view of the abuser: a showbiz type who likes a bit of slap and tickle, an evil rapist. But often an abuser is just very sad. No man would want to behave in this way, surely?

All Jamie wants is a wife, and to be looked after.

I believe he is a nice person, generous and good with children. He has even been helpful, fetching a trailer when my thoroughbred had to be rushed to hospital. But he can’t control, on his own, his obsession.

It is the right of my assistant and friend to live in peace, for her to do her job, and be without fear.

It is the right of the stalker and abuser to get help.

Liz said she feels sorry for Jamie Close, suggesting that he should also receive the help he deserves
