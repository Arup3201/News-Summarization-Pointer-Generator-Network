Sony announced on Friday that it will miss its stock market deadline for publishing its third-quarter earnings as a result of the Sony hack.

The company will still brief analysts on February 4, as previously scheduled, but will only be able to provide estimated information from its movie division Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the financial and electronics division will be finalized numbers but because of the scandal affecting the movie division it will not be able to provide those same amounts.

'The third-quarter figures for Sony as a whole won’t be final, because the movie segment can’t report them by the original deadline,' a Sony spokesman said.

The movie company said that it would need to submit all final company earnings on March 31 when the original final deadline was February 16.

Bloomberg reports that when the FBI told Sony that North Korea was behind the attack, they took their entire network offline including accounting and finances. 

The hack: North Korea is thought to have been behind the Sony Hack in response to the movie The Interview 

The hack was in response to Sony's comedy about North Korea called, 'The Interview' starring Seth Rogan and James Franco.

As a result of that hack, financial and accounting applications at Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. are not expected to be functional until early next month.

The cost related to the hack may cost as much as $169 million Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore, said.

Anvarzadeh recommends buying shares of Sony.

Sony Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai  said that financial damage to Sony from the hacking campaign would likely be limited.

In a statement on Friday he said the impact would be 'light.'
