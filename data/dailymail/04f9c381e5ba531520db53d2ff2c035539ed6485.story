Tax evaders in Argentina are being spotted using a military-style spy in the sky.

Drones have identified around 200 mansions and 100 swimming pools in the area around Buenos Aires that have not been declared by their owners, tax agency officials said.

The unmanned aircraft flew over an exclusive neighbourhood near the capital city and took pictures of luxury houses on sites registered as being empty.

The unregistered mansions and pools were found in an area about 10 miles south of the city and, according to the tax agency, they appeared to be large and constructed with 'premium materials'. 

Owners of the properties have been told to get their papers in order and get ready to pay hefty fines.

The tax evaded has been estimated at a total of £1.2million.

Each drone costs about £6,000 and the technology is also often used by Argentine security forces.

Argentina faces soaring inflation and a slumping currency, although figures this week showed that the economy pulled out of recession in the second quarter of this year.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS), also known as drones, are aircraft either controlled by 'pilots' from the ground or increasingly, following a pre-programmed mission.

Use of drones has been expanding rapidly in Argentina and the rest of South America.

They have been deployed for purposes as diverse as locating drug smuggling routes, monitoring farm crops, and looking for archaeological sites.

The majority of the drone technology being sold to South American governments and companies - £306million between 2005 and 2012 - comes from Israel, according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs.

But drones are also being produced cheaply in Mexico.

The increasing has raised concerns among human rights activists.
