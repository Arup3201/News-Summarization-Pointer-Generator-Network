Transgender model Lea T is making history has the new face of American haircare giant Redken.

The 32-year-old Brazilian model, who was born a boy named Leandro Medeiros Cerezo, shared a picture of her new campaign on Instagram, amassing more than 1,000 'likes'.

In the black-and-white image, the leggy brunette struts her stuff in a black playsuit and stilettos, her wavy locks shining in the light.

As the new face of Redken, Lea will 'showcase her lust-worthy haircolor for an exciting new innovation from Chromatics haircolor,' according to the brand's Instagram page.

Fans have taken to Twitter to congratulate Lea, whose father is well-known former football player Toninho Cerezo.

'So happy to see the beautiful @leatobiofficial making history as the newest face of @Redken5thAve,' wrote one person.

'Lea T is gorgeous. Holy crap!' gushed another, while a third said: 'I LOVE Lea T. Knocking down barriers.'

Since then, she has been the muse for Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, as well as appearing in editorials for magazines including Vogue Paris, Hercules Magazine and Interview Magazine.

She began identifying as transgender early in life and reportedly underwent sex reassignment surgery in Thailand in March 2012.

With her shiny brown mane and stunning looks, it's clear to see why Redken chose her to represent the brand - and it's a role she is taking seriously.

'We're all people with our own personalities, our own beauty, our own lives,' Lea said in a statement.

'I love working with Redken because they appreciate all kinds of beauty. They believe in the individuality of the person, and I think that's really important.'

In 2011, Lea opened up to Oprah about the struggles of growing up knowing she wasn't born with the right body.

'I was hoping I was gay, because, for my family, it would be less painful. And then I could... have a normal life,' she said.

'I wish I could accept my body like men. It would be much easier for me if I could be a straight guy and have a girlfriend, family and daughters, married, all this normal life. But it's something in your brain - born in the wrong body.'

The Chromatics hair color campaign will debut in January 2015 in print and social campaigns.
