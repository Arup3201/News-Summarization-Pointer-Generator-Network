Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer believes their opening game against Portugal is ‘almost like a final’.

The Germans have been handed a tricky start in a group which also includes Ghana and the USA, and Neuer said: ‘After that match, we will really know where we stand. In a way, it’s almost like a final.’

The two sides played each other in the first game of Euro 2012, when a Mario Gomez header gave Germany a 1-0 win.

Fiorentina striker Gomez was left out of the squad for this tournament by manager Joachim Low, who has named just one recognised striker in Miroslav Klose.

Klose, with 14 World Cup goals, is one goal off the record held by former Brazil striker Ronaldo.

Klose may not play today and Low has made no secret of his game plan — to play high-tempo football from the start and to wear down the Portuguese in the midday heat and humidity of Salvador.

‘We are a team that will be difficult to beat,’ said Low, despite the fact that his defence has been hit by injuries that could lead to some significant reshuffles.

Usually a right back, captain Philipp Lahm, who missed most of the training camp with an ankle problem, is likely to move into a defensive midfield role alongside Sami Khedira, who lacks match practice after six months out with a knee injury.

Manchester United target Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has also been nursing a knee injury, is set to start on the bench.

Meanwhile, Franz Beckenbauer has promised to co-operate with FIFA’s ethics investigation into World Cup bidding and has asked for the provisional ban against him to be lifted.

The German legend was handed a 90-day ban for refusing to co-operate with US attorney Michael Garcia’s probe into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, won by Russia and Qatar.

He was forced to call off his visit to the World Cup.
