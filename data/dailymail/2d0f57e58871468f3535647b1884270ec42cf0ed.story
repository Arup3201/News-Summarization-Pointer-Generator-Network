Mrs White, originally from Paignton in Devon, was found just yards from a farmhouse owned by friends where she spent the evening having dinner.

Mrs White and her husband David were said to have moved to France seven years ago and also owned a home nearby, according to police.

Her sister Linda Johnson said today: 'My mother spoke to her just a couple of weeks ago and she seemed absolutely fine.

'This has obviously shocked us all. We are just trying to keep things together.

'If there is anyone who might have information on what happened to Susan then please come forward. That's all we can ask at this moment in time.'

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy said they were aware of the death and doing what they can to help the family.

A Brittany gendarmerie spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the body of a British national has been found.

'We have arrested her partner, but we do not yet know what caused the blow to the head that killed her or why her body was by the roadside.

French detectives say that the woman's body was found by a passing motorist on Monday night

The family of Susan White, whose body was found by a roadside in rural Brittany, France, has appealed for any information that could help explain how she died

'A full investigation is now underway to establish how and why she died.'

A post mortem examination concluded that she died from a fractured skull.

But pathologists say that they were unable to identify the cause with local press speculating that detectives are considering whether a stone or a passing vehicle may have caused her fatal injuries.

Brittany is a region in the north west of France that is home to thousands of British ex-pats.
