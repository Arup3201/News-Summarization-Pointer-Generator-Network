Staff at a cash-strapped council have spent more than £5million on takeaway pizzas, cosmetics, nightclubs and lingerie using company credit cards, it has emerged.

Bosses at Essex County Council allowed 757 employees the use of council purchase cards, resulting in costly shopping sprees at the taxpayer's expense.

The receipts include £644.45 on cosmetics; £3,600 ordering from Domino’s Pizza; £87,023.20 on costly hotel stays; £52,868.60 on theatre tickets and £3,827.21 spent in local bars and nightclubs.

Council staff have also enjoyed living the high life with a £1,400 stay at five-star London hotel The Dorchester.

They have also made three trips to Five Lakes Golf Country Club in Maldon, Essex, at a total cost of £2,200 to the taxpayer.

Over a 27-month period between December 2009 and April 2012 officers racked up a whopping £5,136,145 in spending.

Robert Oxley, from the Taxpayers’ 
Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be left gobsmacked that their money has 
been spent on the council living it up at nightclubs plus stays at 
five-star hotels, shoe-shining and even hat cleaning.

'Residents
will be left wondering why they are picking up bills totalling tens of 
thousands of pounds at country clubs, florists, bakeries and record 
shops.

'The receipts suggest officers at Essex County Council have been enjoying the high life at taxpayers’ expense.'

The spending figures - released following a Freedom of Information request - come just two months after a damning report from the Audit Commission slamming Essex County Council for 'a lack of control over corporate credit cards' dating back to 2009.

Last year, the council cut 450 jobs after slashing its annual budget by £98million as part of sweeping cutbacks.

Purchase cards were first brought in as a 'cost-effective method for low-value purchases' with staff warned they were not for personal use.

But since 2009, the number of purchase cards in use at the council has more than doubled from 295 to 757.

Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said: 'People at Essex County Council need to realise that it isn’t Essex’s money, it isn’t the Government’s money, it is the public’s money and the public have a right to know how it is being spent.

'I’m sure Essex will now look carefully at the number of people holding these cards because it strikes me as excessive.

'If they do that, you are not likely to get money spent on cosmetics and McDonald’s.'

Essex County Council today defended its spending, claiming much of the money was used to cover expenditure for children in their care.

A spokesperson said: 'Essex County Council has a robust policy relating to spend on P-cards and all P-card holders must be given authorisation by a senior manager to carry out such transactions.

'The P-cards are used by officers working across all the council’s services, including schools, children’s homes and our country parks.

'Our Looked After Children teams take on the role of a parent for these children and are responsible for their daily care needs while they are under the care of the county council’s children’s social services.

'Approximately 750 of the 41,000 officers employed by Essex County Council have a card and expenditure on them only relates to a small proportion of our overall budget.'

When asked to explain £17.50 spent at lingerie store La Senza, the council argued it was used to buy clothes for a child in care.

Other shopping trips included £1,000 spent in luxury London department store Harrods during a care trip for children with disabilities.

Selina Huang, 23, who works at a Chinese restaurant in Chelmsford, said: 'What the staff at County Hall are doing with the money is so bad.

'I work very hard every day, and I am so tired, and then they take my tax money and go to a nightclub.'
