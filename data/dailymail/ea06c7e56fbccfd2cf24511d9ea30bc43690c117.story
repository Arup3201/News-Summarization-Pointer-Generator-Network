Whether they are trying to prove their manliness, their style credentials, or it is just sheer laziness, there appears to be a resurgence of facial hair amongst men and actor Hugh Jackman is leading the way.

The Les Miserables star has topped a poll to find the celebrity with the sexiest facial hair - while onetime heartthrob Brad Pitt is deemed to have the worst.

Jackman - nominated for Best Actor at Sunday's Academy Awards for the musical movie  - pipped Silver Linings Playbook star Bradley Cooper to the top spot.

Best beard: Hugh Jackman was voted as having the sexiest beard while Brad Pitt, who usually tops the best looking charts, came bottom

David Beckham came third and George Clooney was fourth.

The survey also looked at the celebrities with the unsexiest facial hair.

Brad Pitt topped this poll with Joaquin Phoenix in second and Duran Duran star Simon Le Bon - pictured recently with a weird handlebar moustache - in third place.

The survey also found that 62 per cent of men reckon they look sexier with some kind of facial hair - either a beard, moustache or designer stubble.

But the same poll found that only 35 per cent of women like men with fuzzy faces - with designer stubble (48 per cent of women like it) far more popular with women than beards (just 18 per cent like them) or moustaches (15 per cent).

Facial hair faux pas: Bradley Cooper just missed out on the top spot while Joaquin Phoenix was at the bottom end of the list

Surgeon Asim Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic who carried out the research said: 'Hugh Jackman looks great whatever kind of facial hair he has - stubble, a moustache or a beard.'

Dr Shahmalak, hair loss expert on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies who has treated Callum Best, said that beards have never been more fashionable and one of the main reasons is because they make men feel more manly.

He said: 'For many men, growing a beard or designer stubble defines their masculinity. It is not surprising that more than six out of ten believe they look sexier with some form of facial hair.

'But they might want to pay attention to what the women in their life are saying - they clearly don't like that manly look quite as much as their partners.'

Boom: People are desperate to get sideburns like Olympian Bradley Wiggins and even John Lewis have roped in a bearded man for their latest campaign

Crown Clinic saw a surge in bookings last year from men who wanted to get their sideburns bolstered with hair transplants so that they could look like Olympic hero Bradley Wiggins.

Wayne Rooney has also sparked a boom in hair transplants for under-30s - with a 25 per cent increase in booklngs since the Manchester United striker had his op.

Dr Shahmalak added: 'Men want to look like their heroes. Sadly they can't always naturally grow a perfect full beard like Hugh Jackman or have bushy sideburns like Bradley Wiggins.

'They will have often patches in their facial hair.

'That is where a transplant clinic like ours can help - we can fill in their gaps and help men to get the look they desire.'
