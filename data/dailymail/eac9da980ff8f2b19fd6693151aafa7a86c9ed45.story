Mathieu Flamini believes Arsenal are finally getting to grips with the perils of life on the road in the Barclays Premier League after the Gunners rallied to hold Everton to a 2-2 draw at Goodison.

The Londoners were humbled 3-0 on this ground late last season and looked to be heading for further embarrassment on Merseyside after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith gave Everton a two-goal lead going into the break.

But, after Aaron Ramsey cut the deficit after 83 minutes, substitute Olivier Giroud headed a late equaliser from Nacho Monreal's cross.

On the road: Mathieu Flamini claims that Arsenal have learned how to play difficult away games

One downbeat note for the Gunners was the half-time substitution of Chilean Alexis Sanchez, their £35million summer signing, who manager Arsene Wenger felt 'struggled with the physicality' and which saw the lively Giroud brought on.

But French midfielder Flamini said: 'We've learned a lot from last year about playing these kind of teams away and we came back today and tried to be stronger. 

'We didn't give up until the last second so it was a game to remember for us. It was a great performance from the team because being 2-0 down was not easy for us. Even though we were losing in the first half we had a few occasions to score so it was a bit unfair for us.'

Hope: Aaron Ramsey collects the ball after scoring late to bring the score to 2-1 at Goodison

Game changer: Olivier Giroud came off the bench to score the equaliser before a late ankle injury

Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger praised Giroud for changing the game after coming on as a second-half substitute.

'We looked much more dangerous (after Giroud came on),' the Arsenal manager said.

'I knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front. That presence was very important.

'He had a very good second half.'

Unfortunately for Wenger, Giroud suffered an ankle injury in the dying minutes and could now miss the second leg of Arsenal's Champions League play-off against Besiktas.

'It is a big game and I hope we have not lost him,' said Wenger of Giroud, who left Goodison Park with a protective boot on his left foot.

'In the final minute he stretched his ankle. At the moment it doesn't look too good. '

Not fit enough! Alexis Sanchez was withdrawn at half-time after an ineffectual performance

Sanchez is likely to lead the line against the Turks, who gained a 0-0 draw against the Gunners in Istanbul on Wednesday.

Wenger said he had no option but to withdraw the £35million signing at half-time on Saturday.

'At the moment he is not completely ready physically,' Wenger said.

'He knows he is not at his best physically but when he is his confidence will come back.'
