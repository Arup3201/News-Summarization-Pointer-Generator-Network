Even the most photogenic souls look awful when having a sneezing fit... unless it's a Persian kitten.

This cutie lets ten sneezes rip in quick succession, and while it makes the viewer feel sorry for the kitty, it's impossible not to go 'aww' as he goes 'ah-choo!'

The owner, and camera operator, lets out a sympathetic 'Oh buddy' when the gorgeous ball of fluff sneezes uncontrollably.

Poor little guy: A Persian kitten sneezes ten times in quick succession 

The fluffy furball has impeccable manners as attempts to cover his mouth mid-sneeze. 

But this young fellow was on a hiding to nothing from the outset.

As it turns out, Persians are more prone to sneezing than most breeds of cat.

Manners: The kitty even looks like he's trying to cover his mouth with his paw 

Their squished-up nose and the smaller than average nasal passages mean their sinuses don't clear out easily and tend to trap dust and other particles.

Still, he can rest safe in the knowledge that his miscomfort - which we've all experienced at some stage - is completely adorable.
