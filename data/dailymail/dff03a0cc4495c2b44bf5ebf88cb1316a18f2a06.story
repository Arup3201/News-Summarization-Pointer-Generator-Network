Liverpool's opponents Ludogorets enjoyed a charmed passage to the group stage after the most unlikely of wins over Romanian champions Steaua Bucharest in the play-off.

Defender Cosmin Moti went in goal after keeper Vladislav Stoyanov was sent off and saved two shoot-out penalties to send his club into the group stage for the first time.

The 29-year-old even scored the first spot-kick himself, while still wearing his gloves, before going in goal to provide more heroics.

Ludogorets had been trailing Steaua 1-0 from the first leg but forced extra-time thanks to a stunning last-minute volley from substitute Wanderson. 

Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre said the the club were thrilled at the draw - and can cope without Luis Suarez following his move to Barcelona.

Ayre, speaking after the draw in Monaco, said: 'You would never not want Luis - Luis is a fantastic player and made a fantastic contribution to Liverpool but so did a lot of other people.

'A lot of the goals that Daniel Sturridge scored were amazingly important for us last season and he will still be there banging them in and we are seeing goals from all over the park last season.

'So I think we are in great shape and will keep developing and improving.'

Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo - named as the European player of the 2013/14 season - told the draw ceremony in Monaco that he believes the club can become the first to successfully defend the Champions League trophy.

He said: 'Why not - everything is possible. I had the opportunity to do it when I was at Manchester United and now for Real Madrid - the biggest clubs in the world so I am looking forward to getting a second chance.'
