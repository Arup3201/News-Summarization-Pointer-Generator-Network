He's got the best moves in Hollywood,  laid back charm that is fast becoming box office gold and chiselled abs that have got us all talking, now with the release of a teaser trailer for Magic Mike XXL, it's clear Channing Tatum is becoming the world's favourite hunk.

The film clip of the stripper drama sequel is  only a minute and a half long but has been viewed more than two million times and women have taken to the web in their thousands to share their admiration for the 34-year-old.

Now, to celebrate the return of our favourite Florida dancer we've taken a look back at Channing's finest moments from posing on the red carpet, playing a tough guy on screen, cuddling his wife Jenna Dewan and appearing in THAT Oscar selfie... to quote the end of the Magic Mike XXL trailer, 'You're welcome.'

He's back: The trailer for  Magic Mike XXL, starring Channing Tatum (second right) and Joe Manganiello (third left) is here

Flashdance: In Magic Mike XXL Channing plays  the stripper who makes bespoke furniture, and in the trailer he's shown in the workshop

In the opening moments of the trailer for the stripper sequel, Channing is shown using power tools in a workshop wearing just a tank top, which offers him a chance to show off his sculpted arms.

The music kicks in and Channing, who plays Mike Lane, starts to gyrate his hips, strip off his welding mask, wipe away the sweat and begin to pop and lock before leaping around the workroom and break dancing on a wooden table.

With such athletic moves, it's hard to believe that the actor - who made his film breakthrough as surly street dancer Tyler Gage in 2006's Step Up - turns 35 in April.

Yet the films are loosely based on his own experiences of being an 18-year-old stripper in Tampa, Florida, which explains his expert performance - and X-rated execution of pelvic-thrusting move 'The Worm'.

Fans have long been anticipating the sequel to the popular 2012 film, Magic Mike, and they have been promised even more 'raunchy latex and leather' by the movie's costume designer. 

On Tuesday, Channing released a picture of the first poster for the movie; a very risqué photo showing the dancer revealing his impressive six pack abs, as he points to his crotch.

In the June issue of GQ, Channing, who has a one-year-old daughter Everly, revealed that the plot would centre around the guys - played by muscled hunks including Joe Manganiello - going away to a stripper convention.

He added that back when he worked as a stripper, he went to these conventions himself.

Those were the days: When the music starts Channing is taken back to his dancing days and starts to pop, lock and gyrate his hips

'The women would come from miles and miles around,' he said. 'Then you lock the doors and you say all bets are off. It gets zany and crazy, and it's a wild ride.' 

She said that the ladies will be sweating more than the men despite their energetic dance moves and they sheer range of thongs and posing pouches worn by the actors will not disappoint.

Back in the day: Rare snaps from 2007 with Garrett Hedlund (l) and with Jenna (r) at the Cove Atlantis Beach Club, Bahamas

Alabama-born Channing is also the star of the hit movie remakes of 21 Jump Street and its sequel 22 Jump Street about cops undercover in high school and then college with Jonah Hill.

He also appeared with Jamie Foxx in action drama White House Down in 2013 and in GI Joe: Retaliation but it's his roles in weepie rom coms such as The Vow with Rachel McAdam, that have earned him his army of female fans.

Channing kicked off his career in 2000 as a dancer in Ricky Martin's She Bangs music video, earning just $400 for the job before becoming a model for Armani and Abercrombie & Fitch. 

Today the actor may be the hottest property in Hollywood, and a heartthrob to thousands, but for him there's only one woman - his partner of nine years, Jenna, who he calls 'a very sexy individual' and the couple make it a priority to be together as much as possible.

He really is a model husband, father and actor.
