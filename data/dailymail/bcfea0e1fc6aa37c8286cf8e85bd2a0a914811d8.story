The closest you’d expect The Great British Bake Off to get to blood is strawberry jam.

But the return of the BBC2 show saw more gory accidents than an episode of Casualty.

It achieved a record audience on Tuesday night as five contestants were shown slicing and grating their thumbs and fingers.

However, instead of complaining, viewers who were treated to close-ups of mangled flesh and oozing blood simply posted a series of appreciative comments online.

Writing on Twitter, one said: ‘Great British Bake Off: God I’ve missed you. Already blood, tears and cake. Perfect.’

Another added: ‘In solidarity with the Bake Off-ers, I have just left a trail of blood across the house, and possibly half an index finger.’ 

A third asked: ‘Is the winner now the person who slices off the most body parts?’

The return of the BBC2 show saw more gory accidents than an episode of Casualty

The episode attracted an average audience of 5.6million, peaking at 6.2million. The figure was a record for a series opener, beating last year’s first episode ratings of 3.8million. 

Viewers hailed the latest episode as the most dramatic to date, beating the moment last year when contestant John Whaite sliced open his finger on an electric mixer.

As hopeful after hopeful sought treatment from the show’s medic, host Sue Perkins said: ‘The battle to impress in this year’s first signature bake is beginning to get a little bloody.’ 

As the accident count mounted, she joked: ‘It’s like a sort of hybrid reality show now.

It’s Bake Off versus Casualty.’ The first contestant to injure herself was 66-year-old Christine.

The camera lingered on images of her lacerated thumb as it was covered in a blue plaster. 

Before long, 38-year-old horticulturalist Lucy and 20-year-old student Ruby had also sought medical help.

After cutting himself on a knife, Howard, 51, was forced to take a break from baking and hold his hands raised in the air to keep the flow of blood to a minimum. But the biggest victim was the episode’s eventual loser, 30-year-old Toby.

After slicing open one thumb and injuring the other on a grater, the web programmer was left unable to ice his final cake, putting him bottom of the competition.

He ruefully admitted: ‘Part of being able to compete in this environment is not cutting yourself and impairing your ability to bake.’

In a recent interview, judge Mary Berry warned viewers to expect a bloody start to this year’s show.

She said: ‘The blue plasters were out. There was a wonderful medic who was so busy. The bakers were nervous and it was cold so I think that’s why they accidentally cut themselves.’
