The latest growth figures are only marginally lower than expected, says Treasurer Joe Hockey.

Gross domestic product expanded by just 0.3 per cent in the September quarter, taking growth in the 12 months to September to 2.7 per cent.

'While the September figures are weaker than market expectations, 0.3 per cent is only marginally lower than what we were expecting,' Mr Hockey said.

The Australian economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the September quarter. Treasurer Joe Hockey (pictured) says that a plunge in iron ore and coal prices was to blame

He said the figure for the last year of the Labor government was 1.9 per cent.

Mr Hockey said while export volumes in the resources industry had been strong and production had picked up strongly, prices for iron ore and thermal coal had fallen dramatically in recent times.

This reflected 'quite starkly' that the resources sector was switching from significant investment to significant production, he said.

Mr Hockey reiterated the government's determination to push ahead with its economic reform agenda.

'These national accounts confirm that when it comes to the future of Australian economy, complacency is our enemy,' he said.

'Doing nothing on economic reform is not an option for our country.'

Disposable income has dropped for two quarters in a row.

Asked whether parts of the economy now appeared to be in recession, Mr Hockey said: 'No.'

'Fundamentally we are endeavouring to stabilise the rise in unemployment,' he said.

'Importantly, we are seeing strong export growth.'

Mr Hockey said he was taking advice from Treasury on the benefits of the three free trade agreements signed with China, Japan and Korea.

'I have no doubt 2015 will be better and beyond will be better than that,' he said.

The dollar fell to a four-and-a-half year low of 83.92 US cents after the data was released.
