David Cameron, pictured today, has privately discussed plans to ensure a power-share agreement if he fails to win a majority in 2015, it has been claimed

David Cameron is plotting to make Tory MPs sign a new coalition with the Liberal Democrats, it was claimed last night.

The Prime Minister has privately discussed plans with cabinet ministers to ensure a power-share agreement if he fails to win a majority in 2015.

Under the plans, backbenchers will get to vote on a new arrangement in order to ‘dip their hands in blood’.

Many Tory rebels have refused to accept the compromises of coalition government because they had no previous say over the deal with the Lib Dems.

Nick Clegg’s MPs, however, have been generally less rebellious because they voted to join the coalition.

A Tory Cabinet Minister said: ‘They had meeting after meeting about the deal. Yes, it took a bit longer, but it meant that every one of them was actively signed up to the Coalition, and that’s meant they’ve been quite disciplined, all things considered.’

Referring to his Conservative colleagues, the minister said: ‘A lot of them don’t feel they had a say, so they aren’t under the same obligation to be supportive.

'We want to avoid that if we have to do it again.’

Ministers have long hinted that Mr Cameron should secure his party’s support before another coalition arrangement.

But the discovery that he is already planning for power sharing will anger many – particularly during a period when Labour’s poll lead is evaporating and the Tories are more confident of winning.

Mr Cameron privately believes that he can win a majority, but his aides believe they should prepare for all eventualities.

Giving MPs veto powers over the terms of a coalition might dissuade them from seeking to oust him if he falls short of outright victory in the polls again.
