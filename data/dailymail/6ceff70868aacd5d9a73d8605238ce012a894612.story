This dramatic picture shows the moment a reckless roller skater put his life and others at risk as he clung onto a speeding car as it reached speeds of 70mph in a Jackass-style stunt.

Dale Powles, 25, was wearing no crash helmet or protective equipment when he clung onto the window of the car as it hurtled along the A16 Peaks Parkway in Grimsby, Lincolnshire.

He was arrested after shocked police discovered a video of the dangerous stunt had been posted on Facebook.

Grimsby Magistrates’ Court heard how pictures and video footage found on Facebook showed Powles being pulled along one of the town’s busiest road, while he was next to the driver’s open window reaching through.

The driver was holding onto Powles and the stunt was filmed by a passenger as they drove at speeds of around 70 mph, last summer.

It was believed that Powles was on roller skates, although these could not be seen on the video.

Powles, of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, admitted aiding and abetting William Wraith to drive dangerously.

Rebecca Perrin, mitigating, said it was a ‘silly and foolish’ offence and Powles could not explain it.

He was not working at the time, ‘had a lot of time to himself’ and was ‘mixing with people he should not have been’.

The car reached speeds of around 70mph as Powles clung onto the vehicle in what has been described in court as a 'silly and pathetic' offence

‘It is not something he is proud of,’ said Miss Perrin.

‘But he was a very different person back then from what he is now.’

The route is governed by a split speed limit of 30mph at the town end, increasing to 50mph after the Weelsby Road junction, and then to 60mph. A consultation is currently underway to increase the 30mph stretch to 40mph.

A charge of dangerous driving against Mr Wraith, 19, of Hainton Avenue, Grimsby, was discontinued by the prosecution at an earlier hearing because of a lack of evidence. It had been listed for trial.

Powles, 25, pictured leaving Grimbsy Magistrates' Court, was given a 20-week suspended prison sentence, a two-year supervision order and was banned from driving for a year

District judge Daniel Curtis told Powles that he put himself at ‘considerable personal risk’ and, if he had become detached from the car, it could have resulted in an accident.

‘That’s probably one of the busiest roads in and out of Grimsby,’ he said. ‘It’s always a road with traffic on it.’

If Powles had fallen, the car might have swerved or caused an accident in which ‘other people going about their business innocently could have been very seriously injured’.

‘It wasn’t a foolish prank, it was utter stupidity,’ said Mr Curtis.

Powles also admitted separate offences of assaulting Jade Dobbs-Chestnut and damaging her door on July 9 as well as assaulting Jolene Stafford on October 7.

He headbutted Miss Dobbs-Chestnut, causing her nose to bleed, after an incident at her home when he was ‘messing about’ with her dog.

The dog attacked him and he threatened to kill it.

During the other assault, he grabbed Miss Stafford by the throat and punched her so forcefully on the nose that she rocked backwards.

The incident followed a confrontation with his ex-girlfriend, Leah Dixey, who was a friend of Miss Stafford.

Powles, who is now working and lives with friends, was given a 20-week suspended prison sentence, a two-year supervision order and was banned from driving for a year.

He must also pay £300 compensation for the assaults, £85 court costs and a Government-imposed £80 victims’ surcharge.
