A married father-of-three has been convicted of stalking a 22-year-old woman on her daily commute after appearing in a Melbourne court today. 

Software engineer Aamer Rana from Dandenong pleaded guilty to the charge for following and harassing Natalie Tyrer on her train ride to work, blaming cultural differences for his behaviour.

In a statement read in the Dandenong Magistrates court on Friday, Ms Tyrer told how Mr Rana would glare at her and follow her if she moved seats on the train.

'He would look for me and then sit or stand near me and stare at me the whole time,'  she said, adding that one one occasion Mr Rana slid forward and touched her knees.

Aamer Rana, a married father-of-three, has been convicted of stalking a young woman on her daily Melbourne train commute since January

On another, he followed her after she moved to a different carriage.

Accompanied by his wife in court, Mr Rana heard how Ms Tyrer would wake in the night, crying with fear because of his stalking, which began in January.

'Actually sometimes you make a mistake and it give you a lesson,' Mr Rana told Nine News outside the court today.  'I will learn it more (sic) I'm in Australian culture, I need to learn it more how people are dealing with each other.' 

Mr Rana blamed cultural differences for his behaviour, saying 'sometimes you make a mistake and it gives you a lesson'. He told media his wife was 'not happy'.

'He would look for me and then sit or stand near me and stare at me the whole time,' said the 22-year-old victim, who told the court she kept waking in the night, crying in fear

Magistrate Doug Bolster ordered Mr Rana to undergo psychological testing and complete 200 hours of community service. He said it was 'fortunate' Mr Rana had no prior convictions.

'It's certainly had a significant impact on her,' Magistrate Bolster said. 

Mr Rana told the Nine reporter his wife was 'not happy' and that he hopes she understands.
