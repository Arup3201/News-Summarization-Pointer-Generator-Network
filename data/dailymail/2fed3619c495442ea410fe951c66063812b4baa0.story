While beards have never been more fashionable, a new survey reveals that almost half of men cannot even grow a proper one.

As many as 45 per cent of men complain that they have bald patches in their beard or sideburns and as a result, men are increasingly getting their beards and sideburns bolstered with hair transplants.

These men are splashing out £4,000 on beard and sideburn transplants to copy the more hirsute look favoured by stars like Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and David Beckham.

According to the International Society of Hair Restoration, more than 4,500 facial hair transplants were carried out in the UK last year - that's more than three times as popular as nose jobs.

But how does it work?

Hair is taken from the back of the scalp in a strip and transplanted into the bald patches of the beard or the sideburn.

Dr Shahmalak, a surgeon at Crown Clinic in Manchester, said he has seen a 25 per cent increase in the number of procedures over the last three years as beards have become more fashionable.

'A proper, full-grown beard has been the ultimate definition of masculinity for centuries. But the sad truth is that many men in Britain struggle to grow beards, sideburns and moustaches.

'They have significant gaps in their facial hair and the end result can look patchy and unconvincing.

'Their problems can be easily remedied with a transplant. We can fill out the areas on their face where there are gaps and they can adopt whatever look they like: a bushy moustache, big sideburns like Bradley Wiggins or the sexy designer stubble or beards often sported by David Beckham or Hugh Jackman.

Facial hair transplants work in the 
same way as hair transplants performed to the patient’s head, using a 
technique called Follicular Unit Extraction (or FUE).

This is a 
minimally invasive transplant technique, which is carried out under 
local anaesthetic.

The procedure involves taking individual hairs from 
an area on the head where the hair is plentiful, and transplanting these
 hairs into the areas on the face that the patient would like to 
target. 

A standard FUE 
facial hair transplant procedure can last many hours, depending on the 
number of hairs which require transplanting & is performed under a 
local anaesthetic.

The number of hairs required will be assessed by a 
hair transplant surgeon and this will depend on the density the patient 
is looking for.

'Men see people David Beckham and want to
 copy his look. He does all kinds of interesting things with his facial 
hair. He'll wear a full beard one month, designer stubble the next and 
we've also seen him with a moustache and clean-shaven.

'He cleverly uses his facial hair to completely change his image - it is part of what makes him such an enduring style icon.'

Dr Shahmalak, who has carried out two hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies star Christian Jessen, explained that patchy facial hair was a genetic problem. 'If the father had trouble growing a beard then there is a good chance the son will also have patchy facial hair.

'It is why men in Mediterranean countries often have strong beards - it simply runs through one generation to the next.'

Dr Raghu Reddy, Hair Transplant Surgeon at The Private Clinic, added: 'Facial hair transplants are continuing to grow in popularity, particularly as we see beards coming back into fashion.

'Men who choose to undergo facial hair transplants are often cash rich, time poor, working men who want to look their best and are looking for effective, long lasting results.

'A facial hair transplant is a good option for men who do have facial hair but would like it to be thicker or fuller or to achieve a desirable shape of beard.

'We expect the demand to grow as it is a walk in walk out procedure with minimal downtime.'

The poll also revealed that 59 per cent of men said that a beard made them feel more macho.

While a beard can boost a man's self-esteem, it does very little for his sex appeal, according to women.

Two-thirds of women said they preferred the clean-shaven look to a beard.
