Solitary: Steve Fuller has worked as the winter caretaker of Yellowstone National Park since 1973

Steve Fuller has lived in New York, San Francisco and London, but the place he decided to settle down is about the opposite of any booming metropolis.

For the past 42 years, Fuller has worked as the caretaker of Yellowstone National Park, protecting the park's buildings during the long and brutal winter months.

He lives in a small cabin alone during the winter, with enough food stored up since his closest neighbors are a two-hour snowmobile ride away. 

It sounds like the premise of Stephen King's thriller The Shining, but Fuller claims he's never felt lonely or the least bit antsy cooped up alone in his cabin. 

'Never had cabin fever. Never been bored,' the 70-something outdoorsman told CBS.

That's because there's plenty of work to keep Fuller busy. Winter preparation starts in November, when he works with a crew to board up his share of the parks about 100 buildings.

Then, once everyone is gone, he waits for the snow to come - and it never disappoints. 

Yellowstone averages about 150 inches of snowfall a year and Fuller has to stop it from accumulating on the roofs of the park's buildings, which can collapse under the weight of the snow.

Over the years, Fuller has developed a system which takes some of the hassle out of shoveling the roofs. Instead, he uses a saw to cut the snow into blocks which he then pushes off the roof with the help of gravity.

Fuller has been doing the job since 1973, when he was the only applicant and the pay was just $13.24 a day.

Over the years, Fuller's responsibilities have grown and now he is one of the only Yellowstone staffers who work at the park year round.

Tough work: During the day, Fuller works to keep about 100 buildings free from snow, since they can collapse under the several feet that accumulate every year. He has developed a method of sawing the snow into blocks and pushing them off the roof, which makes the job a little easier 

The cold months: The winter care-taking job starts at the beginning of November and ends whenever plows can reach the park. Above a group of bison seen in a snow-covered Yellowstone field 

Winter home: This small 100-year-old cabin is where Fuller calls home. he packs it with just enough food to last the winter 

While most caretakers only last a few years in the job, Fuller continues because he's comfortable with the solitude and has the right interests to make the job fun. 

Amazingly, Fuller has no TV in his small cabin, which he estimates is about 100 years old. 

Instead, he gets his news by tuning into Wyoming Public Radio and entertains himself with his vast library of books. He also spends a lot of time outside cross-country skiing and taking pictures of the winter landscape.

Many of his pictures of the frozen-over park have been featured in National Geographic. 

'I've seen many wonderful things here,' he said. 'Occasionally get a picture of them. But a lot of the great pictures are in my head, you know, that you couldn't quite pull it off with a camera.'

In 1978, he illustrated his own story for the magazine about raising his two daughters at the park.

Avid reader: Fuller has no TV. Instead, he reads for entertainment and has a vast library 

Technology: Fuller is able to connect to the outside world with a computer. He gets his news from listening to the radio 

Far from civilization: Fuller's closest neighbors are about a two-hour snowmobile ride away

During the winter, he and ex-wife Angela home-schooled the two girls, which they were suited to with his bachelor's degree in history and her master's in education.

His daughters are grown now and Fuller has since broken up with his wife, but they made plenty of memories during their winters together in Yellowstone. 

In 1973, a female grizzly bear broke a window into their kitchen while Angela was cooking a pot of stew for dinner. 

The sow reached in and grabbed the pot and luckily took off with the meal instead of sticking around. 

'The next morning I found the pot behind the house, licked shiny clean,' Fuller said in his National Geographic piece. 

Beautiful scenery: Fuller is also a gifted photographer, and many of his pictures of the snowy Yellowstone landscape have been featured in National Geographic

He had iron bars installed on the windows to protect from any future run-ins with the local wildlife. 

Fuller says there's no set schedule in place for when the care-taking season ends. It's over when the plows can reach him.  

'This job has never been by the calendar or by the clock,' Fuller said. 'You work with the winter. You work with Mother Nature.' 

In the warmer months, Fuller gets some much-needed sun and travels to Africa where he spends every April on safari. 

Before be became caretaker at Yellowstone, Fuller spent three years living in Uganda and Kenya teaching and it was during that time that he first became interested in the quieter life.

'It changed my life,' he said of his time in the African bush, 'and that's what brought me here.' 

With his older age, Fuller says he's considered retirement, but doesn't seem to have taken the prospect too seriously.

'I think of it. They say a lot of people die when they retire, you know?' he said. 

However, he does think his way of life may be coming to an end, as transportation in and out the park during the winter months gets easier.
