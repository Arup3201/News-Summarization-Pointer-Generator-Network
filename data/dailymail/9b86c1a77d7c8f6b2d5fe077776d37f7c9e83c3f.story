The mother of a Down Syndrome child who she was accused of abandoning by the father of the baby has reconciled with her estranged husband.

Samuel Forrest, from New Zealand, made international headlines in February after he started fundraising to help raise baby Leo. 

Mr Forrest's Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan filed for divorce a week after Leo was born in her home country - where a disability like Down Syndrome is considered shameful - on January 21.

New Zealand's Samuel Forrest and his Armenia wife, Ruzan Badalyan, have reportedly reconciled

The story of Mr Forrest, Ms Badalyan and their son, Leo, has made international headlines after it emerged she filed for divorce a week after the birth of the baby who has Down Syndrome

So far, the Bring Leo Home campaign has raised more than $600,000 after celebrities such as U.S. actor Ashton Kutcher lent his fame to the single dad's cause.

In a new twist in the story, it has now emerged Ms Badalyan is applying for permanent residency in New Zealand to give her relationship with Mr Forrest another shot, stuff.co.nz reported.

The couple - who are not officially divorced under Armenian law - have their sights sets on moving to Auckland with Leo.

'They want to raise him in New Zealand but it all depends on whether New Zealand Immigration will find it legitimate,' a person close to the couple told the New Zealand news website.

'Despite all the negative media and emotional struggle, she wanted to go against the cultural norm and embrace the son. But there is a lot of money involved now.'

Since the story of baby Leo emerged, Ms Badalyan has faced harsh criticisms from the public who have slammed her for abandoning her Down Syndrome child. 

Mr Forrest took up fundraising to try and get his son to New Zealand, and so far the campaign has raised more than $600,000

In the weeks following the intense media scrutiny, Mr Forrest has come to her defence, saying she is one of the 'victims of the social norms in Armenia'.

The couple had been married for 18 months

At the time, Mr Forrest said his wife refused to look at or even touch Leo because in her culture a child with a condition like Leo's brings shame on the entire family.

Neither Mr Forrest nor New Zealand's Department of Immigration were unable to confirm to stuff.co.nz that Ms Badalyan was seeking residency.

When the NZ news outlet spoke to Mr Forrest, he did not want to talk about he and his wife reunited.

He said he was 'focussing my efforts on giving my son Leo the best chance possible at life'.

Mr Forrest requested privacy and did not wish to comment further on the matter.

Earlier this month, it was also revealed Mr Forrest was part of religious group, the Exclusive Brethren, while he was married to his first wife, Kylie Forrest.

He claimed he was then ex-communicated from the church and banned from seeing his four children with Ms Forrest.

Reports claimed one of these children had Down Syndrome as well. 

But Ms Forrest has since come out and denied these allegations, saying their youngest child had suffered complications due to a premature birth, the New Zealand Herald reported.

A former neighbour said Mr Forrest, who is still in Armenia, had also been fined $530 for assaulting his first father-in-law.

It has also emerged Ms Badalyan's husband also has four other children from his first marriage
