Tesco is at the centre of cruelty allegations over its stores in China, where turtles are being butchered or suffocated in front of customers.

In some instances the reptiles are plucked from tanks and triple-wrapped in plastic bags, where they suffocate over a period of an hour.

Soft-shelled turtles – a popular delicacy priced at £5 – have their heads chopped off.

Cruelty: The reptiles and plucked from tanks and triple-wrapped in plastic bags, which slowly suffocates them

The scenes were witnessed by the Daily Mail in Beijing yesterday and continue despite repeated promises from Tesco dating back to 2007 to protect and promote animal welfare.

The UK-Based One World Wildlife is demanding Tesco reassess its business ethics and stops selling live creatures in their supermarkets.

The group is behind a petition calling on the chain’s chief executive, Philip Clarke, to stop the turtle sales, which has been signed by some 45,000 people.

It says the supermarket giant should take responsibility for all stages of these creatures ‘tortured existence’ from being farmed in terrible conditions to being sold alive or butchered in store.

Spokesman for the group, Dominic Neate, said: ‘We may think of turtles as pets like kittens and puppies, but Tesco will butcher them in front of your eyes, or wrap them live in plastic, unable to breathe, advising you that it’s best to eat them within the hour.

‘It is incredible for a company that claims to have high standards of animal welfare. Just because it’s in China, doesn’t make it right. This must stop now.’

China is proving to be a tough market to crack for Tesco, which is struggling to make money in the country.

Last month it announced a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise (CRE), and the UK firm will combine its Tesco China business, which includes 134 stores, with the 2,986 stores held by CRE.

Suffering: The Daily Mail witnessed a store attendant try repeatedly to behead a turtle

The Daily Mail went to the same Tesco stores in Beijing that were visited by David Cameron during a UK trade mission in 2010.

In one, members of staff in white uniforms were standing around the meat and fish counters where tanks held live turtles, fish, bull frogs and terrapins.

One caught a turtle in a pair of 10-inch metal tongs and wrapped it in three thin plastic bags. The turtle desperately fought to get out of the bag until it was returned to the customer service desk.

At the Fengtai East branch, a member of staff hacked at a soft shell turtle for seven minutes, trying to chop its head off.

The middle-aged staff member turned with an impatient expression, and said:  ‘Look, I’ll let you know when it’s done. The head won’t come out.’

Five minutes later the grisly job was done and the butcher, with dark blood speckles on his apron, asked if we also wanted the head, too.

Animal activists say a turtle remains aware and able to move its eyes for up to an hour after decapitation unless their skulls are crushed with a hammer.

An assistant explained: ‘First you chop the head off and then you lift the turtle up so as to let the blood drain.

‘When you get home, put it in boiled water to sterilise it. After a few minutes later, take a knife and cut the shell off the turtle, remove the innards and rinse it.

‘Then chop into pieces and it’s done.’

The fresh water turtles are shipped from farms in Dalian, a Northeast China coastal city. The meat sells for £6-£10 a kilo.

Tesco customer Wang Shen, a 30-year-old from Beijing, said:  ‘It’s no big deal selling live turtles and bull frogs in the supermarket.

‘Each country has its own tradition. The British people are against killing turtles or bull frogs because they don’t have a tradition of eating them.

‘What do the British people think about eating cows and sheep?’

Tesco insisted it operates to higher welfare standards than any other retailer in China and that its policies are driving up standards in the country’s food supply industry.

Last night, a Tesco spokesman said: 'We have listened to the concerns raised by our customers and as a result we have made several significant improvements, to ensure that the welfare of turtles sold in our China stores is of the highest possible standard.

'We hope that these actions will help to drive up standards further throughout the supply chain.'
