A cab driver who refused to pick up a
 blind couple and their guide dogs has been fined in one of the first 
cases of its kind in the UK.

Martin Roberts and Clare Burman had booked a taxi to collect them from their home in Ipswich, Suffolk.

But when driver Metin Akin heard they had dogs he turned down the job, saying he did not want the animals on his car's leather seats.

Mr Roberts, who has been blind since birth, called the Ipswich Cabs 289 company to ask where his taxi was after it failed to turn up 15 minutes after the time he had booked.

The operator told him that a driver had refused to take the fare because he was worried about the couple's two labrador guide dogs damaging the black leather seats in his silver VW Passat.

Mr Roberts, 35, and 32-year-old Miss Burman, who has been registered blind since the age of 13, then had to wait a further 20 minutes for another taxi driver to pick them up and take them home, on July 8 last year.

The
 couple reached their destination with dogs Malone and Vikki but then 
complained to Ipswich Borough Council who brought charges against Akin 
under the 2010 Equality Act.

Akin later claimed that the real reason was that he was allergic to dogs and was scared of them as he had been attacked by dogs when he was a child in Antalya, Turkey.

The driver, who has been in the UK for four years, also claimed that he did not think his car was big enough for the two dogs.

He was prosecuted by the council and 
admitted a charge of breaking his licence conditions by refusing to pick
 up a disabled person and his assistance dog.

Akin, 32, was fined £165 and ordered to pay £1,233.50 costs after he admitted refusing to transport the couple.

The
 case before South East Suffolk magistrates on Thursday is one of a 
handful of similar ones heard in the UK since the introduction of the 
act.

Mr Roberts who works in computer sales said had been left 'embarrassed and humiliated' by Akin's refusal to take the dogs.

He and Miss Burman, a computer skills teacher for Ipswich Blind Society, were at her father's house when they booked cab to drive them three miles home.

Mr Roberts said the taxi company were aware that he was with his three-year-old dog Vikki and Miss Burman had her eight-year-old dog Malone.

He said after the case: 'I had used the taxi company lots of times in the past without any problem.

The act requires equal treatment for everyone in access to employment as well as to private and public services - such as taxi cabs.

This must be given regardless of the 'protected characteristics' of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation of the people concerned.

In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people.

Certain forms of employment have been given exemptions under the Act, including priests and actors. 

'When the cab failed to turn up about 15 minutes after it was expected, I called back to ask what had happened.

'The operator told me that they were sending another car because the nearest driver was refusing to pick us up as he had leather seats and was concerned about our dogs.

'Apparently the operator told him that it was the law that he had to pick us up, but he still refused.

'It was a ridiculous reason because guide dogs are trained not to climb on furniture or sit on seats.

'are always well behaved and sit in the footwells of cars or go in the boot of hatchbacks if the parcel shelf is out.

'Clare usually sits at the front of cabs with the seat pushed back and Malone at her feet and Vikki goes in the back in the rear footwell next to me.

'All taxi drivers are required to carry guide dogs unless they have a certificate giving them exemption for medical reasons.

'We felt embarrassed and humiliated. Imagine if you were denied a cab ride because of the sex or the colour of your skin? It is discrimination.

'I decided to make a stand by complaining to the council and they were very sympathetic. I am glad that they pursued the case in court.

'I want this to send a message out to other taxi drivers that they have to abide by the law. I want to speak out because there might be other blind people who don't feel confident enough to do so.'

Mr Roberts said the cab company was not to blame for the driver's behaviour.

He added: 'I want to make it clear that they have always been excellent and have assisted us in every way possible. We are still using them regularly.

'We are also glad that the driver is still working there. I don't think it is right that he should lose his job over it.'

Ipswich council solicitor Christopher Bing told magistrates that Atkin was the closest driver in the area and had initially accepted the fare.

But then he turned down the fare when he realised he would have to transport the dogs, telling his controller that he was worried about his seats, said Mr Bing.

The court heard how Akin applied for an exemption certificate last August to give him the right to refuse to carry guide dogs on the grounds that he was allergic to dogs.

But his application was refused after he had pin-prick tests which showed he was not allergic to them.

Akin claimed yesterday that he had not refused to pick up the dogs because of his leather seats.

He said: 'I think I am allergic to dogs. They make my throat sore and I don't like them.

'I have taken one dog at a time in my cab without any problem. It was because there were two dogs. I didn't think it was safe and I thought a bigger car was needed.

'Also I was frightened because I was attacked by two dogs when I was young. Psychologically, I didn't want to pick them up.'

Sandy Martin, the Fairer Ipswich portfolio holder for Ipswich Borough Council, said: 'We will not tolerate any discriminatory behaviour by taxi drivers whether it is on the grounds of disability, sex, religion or ethnic origin.'
