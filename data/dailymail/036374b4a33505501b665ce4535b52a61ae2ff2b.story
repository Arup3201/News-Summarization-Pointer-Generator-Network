Riot police fought running battles 
with hooded youths in Athens today as protests continued for a second day today as thousands took to the streets to fight against tough austerity measures.

Parts of the Greek capital were 
ablaze and dozens were injured as youths hurled rocks, bricks and petrol
 bombs at police, who responded with baton charges and tear gas.

Protesters, taking part in a two-day national strike, remained on the streets through the night as clashes continued this morning.

Hundreds of terrified tourists ran 
for safety from cafes and restaurants as youths, many wearing gas masks 
and scarves covering their faces, rampaged in front of luxury hotels in 
Syntagma Square.

Five thousand police patrolled the streets, but shops, banks, trucks and bins were set on fire.

The rioting came as the Greek parliament debated a £25billion austerity package demanded by the European Union.

Parliament is due to vote today and 
tomorrow on spending cuts, tax increases and privatisations agreed as 
part of a massive bailout – the second granted to Greece – aimed at 
averting the eurozone’s first debt default.

EU economics commissioner Olli Rehn warned that if Greece did not vote for more austerity, there would be no more bailout money.

‘I trust that Greek political 
leaders  are fully aware of the responsibility that lies on their 
shoulders to avoid default: the only way to avoid immediate default is 
for parliament to endorse the revised economic programme,’ he said.

Crunch time: Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou faces a crucial vote on tough austerity measures today

The reforms are expected to scrape through parliament.

Without a new plan in place, the EU 
and International Monetary Fund say they will withhold around £10billion
 in euro loans that Greece needs to repay debts in mid-July.

However, polls suggest up to 80 per 
cent of Greeks oppose the measures, which Prime Minister George  
Papandreou says are the only way to put the country ‘back on its feet’.

The government’s opponents say  the 
measures will place taxes on  minimum-wage earners and other struggling 
Greeks, already hit by an  earlier austerity package and facing 
unemployment levels of more than 16 per cent.

‘The situation the workers are going 
through is tragic and we are near poverty levels,’ said Spyros 
Linardopoulos, a protester with the PAME union blockading the port of 
Piraeus.

‘The government has declared war and to this we will answer back with war.’

Everyone from doctors and ambulance drivers to casino workers and even actors at a state-funded theatre stopped work yesterday to join the strikers or held stoppages for several hours.

The general strike halted public services, closed banks, devastated train, bus and ferry networks, shut airports and blocked ports. At the same time, an ongoing strike by electricity workers has resulted in rolling blackouts.
