Juan Mata believes Manchester United will qualify for next season's Champions League despite facing stiff competition from the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal for a top four spot.

The Spanish playmaker, in an exclusive Facebook fan Q&A session, has warned his team-mates that 'Manchester United must always play in the Champions League'.

United, who missed out on playing in this season's Champions League after finishing seventh last season, are currently fourth in the Barclays Premier League but are just two points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool.

Louis van Gaal's side face a tense finish to the season but Mata has backed his side to have a positive end to the campaign.

'Manchester United must always play in the Champions League and we believe we’ll make it.'

Mata is hoping his side can get back to winning ways against Tottenham on Sunday following United's FA Cup exit at the hands of Arsenal.

He is also keen to reclaim a spot in Van Gaal's first team plans after being named on the substitutes' bench for United's last seven fixtures.

'Hopefully it is going to be a good result for us,' added Mata. 'I enjoy playing against Tottenham because I have had some good experiences against them!

'I'm working in the same way I have always done, with the same attitude and the same passion! That’s all I can do, I'm always optimistic and ready to contribute to the team at any time!'

Louis van Gaal will be hoping his side can bounce back from Monday's FA Cup defeat by Arsenal
