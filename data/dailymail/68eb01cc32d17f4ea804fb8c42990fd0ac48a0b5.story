Gabriel Agbonlahor will miss Aston Villa's Barclays Premier League home game with Sunderland on Sunday through suspension.

Agbonlahor was cleared to play at Swansea on Boxing Day after being sent off against Manchester United but, having had the first red card of his career rescinded, the striker then picked up a fifth booking of the season in Villa's 1-0 defeat at the Liberty Stadium.
