France’s state-run railway looks poised to take control of Britain’s flagship East Coast mainline after shares in the two rival British bidders plummeted amid market speculation of a Gallic take-over.

The value of First Group fell by £150 million, while Stagecoach, which has submitted a joint bid with Virgin, saw £33 million wiped off its shares.

Big money in the City was betting strongly that a bid by Channel Tunnel rail operator Eurostar International and sister company Keolis – both controlled by Socialist France’s state-owned rail firm SNCF – is set to win the contract for the route from London to Edinburgh.

If confirmed later this week, the decision is set to provoke outrage among UK rail bosses and unions. Critics fear it is yet another example of the UK ‘selling off the family silver’ to foreign investors.

Rail unions say the sell-off is in any case ‘a national disgrace’ and that French, German and Dutch state-owned railways have already made huge inroads into the UK’s privatised franchises.

The RMT union said this ‘proves once again that the Government are happy to have state control of our main inter-city routes as long as it’s not the British state.’

The RMT recently published research showing that 20 of the UK’s 27 private rail franchises, the equivalent of 74 per cent, are now owned by foreign state-owned or state-backed railways ‘with the vast majority being from France, Germany and the Netherlands’.

Shares in two major British transport firms which mounted rival bids against the French both fell sharply yesterday.

First Group bore the brunt of the hit, seeing its share price plummet 10 per cent or 11.6p to 108.2p, wiping nearly £150million off its value.

Stagecoach shares were down 1.5per cent to 362.4p, knocking around £33million off the share price.

A spokesman for First Group, which runs existing UK franchises including Great Western, ScotRail and Transpennine said it does not comment on ‘market rumours and speculation.’

Virgin Rail also declined to comment ahead of an official announcement.

But defeat would mark another bitter disappointment for First, which was passed over to continue running ScotRail franchise in favour of Dutch-owed Abellio, lost out for the Thameslink Great Northern service as well as the Essex Thameside operations.

Ironically, the East Coast line is currently owned by the taxpayer and controlled by the Government via a specially established company called Directly Operated Railways (DOR) in Whitehall. Profits go back to the taxpayer rather than to shareholders.

The state-run East Coast mainline has generated a bumper £1billion windfall for taxpayers over five years since 2009 - prompting unions to brand its sell off back to the private sector as ‘a national disgrace.’

East Coast paid a record £235m back to the Government in its final full year as a ‘nationalised’ company – up 12 per cent on the previous year.

RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: ‘We are rapidly heading towards a situation where almost the entire train operation in Britain is in the hands of overseas companies sucking out profits to benefit their own domestic transport services.’

Germany’s state-owned Deutsche Bahn is already a big player.

Mr Cash added: ‘It seems you can have state operation of railways in Britain as long as it isn’t by the British state for the benefit of the British people. There must be a full parliamentary inquiry into this appalling racket.’

The East Coast main line has been under the control of the Department for Transport since the previous private-sector operator National Express pulled out in 2009.

Before that, in 2007, another private company GNER also ceased its East Coast operation after its parent company Sea Containers ran into financial difficulties.

The Government hands over operation of the line in March next year.

The Department for Transport says it has considered value for money, long-term benefits for communities across the route and improved services for passengers and local businesses ‘and not just the return to the taxpayer.’
