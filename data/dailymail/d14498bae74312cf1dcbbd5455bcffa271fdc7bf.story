If you're looking for your better half on Match.com, odds are you've seen Yuliana Avalos.

The part-time model and mother has never joined the dating site, but says that her pictures have been used in hundreds of fake profiles without her consent. 

'Not a day goes by when someone doesn't tell me that they saw my pictures posted on Match.com or another web site,' Ms Avalos said. 

Now she is suing the website for 
$1.5billion along with 'thousands' of others including famous actors, 
military personnel and Facebook users who say their pictures were used 
without their consent.

The face of a hundred catfish: Model Yuliana 
Avalos is suing Match.com for $1.5billion because hundreds of users have
used her pictures in their profiles without her consent. Above, a

Growing problem: Thousands have joined the class-action lawsuit against the dating site, including famous actors, military personnel and Facebook users

Ms Avalos and the group claim that Match.com broke copyright laws and committed common law fraud by approving the fake profiles when they easily could have weeded them out with facial recognition software.

Not me: Using facial recognition software, Avalos found over 200 profiles using her pictures

'When I saw how this free software worked, it can billions of images simultaneously,' said Ms Avalos' attorney Evan Spencer. 'They can screen and make sure that the photo never appears again.'

Through the facial recognition software, Mr Spencer was able to figure out that Ms Avalos' picture was used in over 200 profiles.

Mr Spencer says that the company has chosen not to use this technology in order to maintain its rank as  one of the largest dating sites on the web. 

Match.com - which uses the 
catchphrase 'more dates, more relationships, more marriages' - currently
ranks as the second largest dating site with 96million registered 
users, but only around 1.4million are active profiles.

The
lawsuit even claims that the website is creating fake profiles on 
purpose, but doesn't go into detail about how that's done. The suit says
that it's in the website's best interest to have a large pool of 
members.

For the negligent and unjust enrichment charges, the group is seeking $500million in damages and $1billion in punitive damages.

Match.com was launched in 1995 and is owned by IAC, a media and internet company based in New York.
