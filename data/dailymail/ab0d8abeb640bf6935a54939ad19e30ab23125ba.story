It was barely off the starting blocks when a CarQuest Top Dragster exploded into a ball of flames at a Texas Superchargers event on Saturday.

The car shuffled to a halt as the flames, somewhat reduced after the initial explosion, continued to burn.

With the race temporarily suspended, the video shows a tense moment where it is unclear whether the car will go up again or the worst of the flames is over.

Bystanders can be seen coughing as the flaming car flies by with a cloud of smoke in its wake.

As the explosion occurred, pieces of the car went flying, narrowly missing spectators at a track in Holland, Bell County, Texas. Despite the dramatic scene,  nobody was injured.

The driver  emerged from the battered vehicle largely unscathed by what could have been a catastrophic incident.

With disaster narrowly missed when the incident occurred at around 11pm on Saturday night, races resumed around 2am for the second round of qualifying.
