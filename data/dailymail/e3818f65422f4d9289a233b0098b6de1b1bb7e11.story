South African prosecutors have won their bid to appeal the culpable homicide verdict handed down to Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius for killing his girlfriend and will now seek a murder conviction.

'I cannot say the prospect of success at the Supreme Court is remote,' said Pretoria High Court Judge Thokozile Masipa in granting the appeal.

Prosecution lawyers applied for leave to appeal after Judge Thokozile Masipa in October sentenced the Paralympic gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest.

The state lost an application to challenge that sentence - although it could still petition that decision.

Judge Masipa has ruled that prosecution lawyers can appeal against the decision not to convict Oscar Pistorius of murder after he admitted shooting Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day last year

Pistorius admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013, insisting he thought she was an intruder.

After a seven-month trial, Judge Masipa found him guilty of culpable homicide, equivalent to the UK crime of manslaughter, after throwing out a more serious charge of murdering Miss Steenkamp.

State prosecutor Gerrie Nel said in his application to appeal on Tuesday that the judgement was 'shockingly inappropriate' and requested permission to seek a murder conviction, which would carry a minimum 15 year jail term.

Nel argued that even if Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was behind the door when he fired, the athlete showed intent to kill whoever was in the small toilet cubicle.

Pistorius's jail term will not be extended unless the state convinces the Supreme Court of Appeal to overturn the original culpable homicide verdict.

Tiaan Labuschagne, of South African law firm Greyvensteins, said an appeal court will decide whether or not Judge Masipa made a mistake in her interpretation of the law when she handed found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide.

If the panel decides Judge Masipa did err, they will look back at the facts presented in the original trial and could then convict Pistorius of murder if they decide the facts of the case support that, Mr Labuschagne said. 

Nathi Mncube, the prosecution spokesman, said he hopes the appeal will be 'expedited' but acknowledged that the process can take a long time.

In arguing for an appeal, the prosecution said the judge incorrectly interpreted a legal principle. Under that principle, a person should be found guilty of murder if he foresaw the possibility of a person dying because of his actions and went ahead anyway.

'We're happy,' Mr Mncube said after the hearing.

Pistorius now faces the prospect of a murder conviction. Once prosecutors appeal the conviction, the appeals court will review the case to determine if the verdict was appropriate.

Pistorius could be out of jail and serving out the rest of his five-year sentence on house arrest by the time prosecutors can appeal his conviction, an expert said today. 

Terry Price, a top South African criminal advocate, said the appeal wasn't likely to be heard until summer 2015. 

Pistorius was sentenced to five years in jail on October 21, but according to South African law he can be eligible for release to house arrest after serving just one-sixth of that sentence, equivalent to 10 months. 

That means that if the Commission of Prisons agrees he's no longer a risk to the public Pistorius could be out by August 21.  

Mr Price said the appeal was likely to be heard by South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein.

'There's a big question mark over the meaning of dolus eventualis,' he said, referring to the legal principle the interpretation of which lies at the heart of the appeal.

'Whether she (Judge Thokozile Masipa) applied it correctly or not is the issue.

'The Supreme Court of Appeal will want it because they want to clear up exactly what it means.' 

Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria courtroom where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel yesterday said she had made a mistake in her interpretation of the law.

He told her: 'There is a very good prospect that we may convince an appeal court that the shortest possible incarceration in a case like this, my lady, is shockingly inappropriate.'  

Ahead of the application, Miss Steenkamp's mother, June, said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter's death.

She told Alex Crawford from Sky News: 'I wanted the truth (at the trial), but it seems some of the puzzle is missing.

'There's only two people who know what happened. One of them's my daughter and she's not here anymore.'  

She said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family. 

Mrs Steenkamp added: 'What difference is it going to make to me? I wanted to see him go down the steps [to the court cells].

'So it doesn't really matter how long - he's going to know that he can't go around hurting people.' 

Mrs Steenkamp and her husband Barry previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder. 

In a bizarre twist, Mannie Witz, one of South Africa's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials, said Pistorius could apply for bail even though it 'would cause a public outcry'.

He told MailOnline: 'They could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence.

'The prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down.'

Another lawyer said the decision to throw out the Shrien Dewani murder trial in Cape Town yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair.  

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel argued in appeal papers filed last month that Judge Masipa misinterpreted the law when she ruled Pistorius did not intentionally shoot Miss Steenkamp, describing the sentence as 'shockingly light' and 'inappropriate'. 

Pistorius, a South African athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able-bodied runners in the Olympics, can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars, which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls.

Should Judge Masipa grant the appeal, the case will be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital.

Reeva Steenkamp's parents Barry Steenkamp and June Steenkamp, previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder, bit found guilty of manslaughter

Hood said that with the decision of a Cape Town court yesterday to throw out the Shrien Dewani case - another high-profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - South Africa's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair.

'From a perception point of view, both public and internationally, we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system.'

Pistorius, who celebrated his 28th birthday last month, has been serving his sentence in a Pretoria prison.

'He's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners. There are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed,' said his older brother Carl, in an interview with You magazine, a South African tabloid.

Pistorius has been accused of receiving special treatment in South Africa's notoriously corrupt prisons, where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars.

Yet Carl dismissed claims his brother is living the good life, saying Pistorius relies on weekly 45-minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks, including baked beans and canned pilchards.

'He now lives moment by moment,' said Carl. 'There's no fairytale.'
