The BBC should increase the licence fee in line with inflation and raise more money through commercial ventures, it has been proposed.

The broadcaster revealed the suggestion after a newspaper alleged that a secret review into the organisation's funding suggested replacing the licence fee with a subscription service from 2020.

The article claimed that the majority of a 12-strong centenary review set up by James Purnell, the former Labour minister turned BBC director of strategy and digital, supported the change.

The Sunday Times also reported that the review recommended freezing the licence fee until 2020.

But a BBC spokesman said: ‘The report recommends that the BBC pursue an inflationary licence fee increase with greater commercial revenue. No subscription model is recommended.'

The future funding of the BBC is in the spotlight, with its charter up for renewal in 2017.

On Friday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling mooted the idea of making the non-payment of the licence fee a civil rather than criminal matter to ease the pressure on courts.

Cases of people accused of evading the £145.50 annual fee accounted for in excess of one in 10 of all criminal prosecutions last year - with 155,000 convicted and fined.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the proposal, backed by more than 100 MPs, was an ‘interesting’ idea which could form part of negotiations over the renewal of the BBC charter.

‘It is socially unjust that so many are fined and indeed go to prison for not paying the licence fee,’ Mr Elstein said, reported The Sunday Times.

‘And it makes more sense too for the BBC to move to subscription from 2020, which is about the date when set-boxes go, and standard definition is phased out to high definition.’

BBC Director General Lord Hall last week confirmed that digital TV channel BBC3 is set to be axed as part of the latest bout of cost-cutting at the corporation.

The channel will move online to save £50million a year, and Lord Hall refused to rule out further cuts, including axing BBC Four.

The idea of replacing the subscription service has been raised before. Last month former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross said that the current charter should be the last and it should be replaced with a subscription system.

Addressing a seminar discussion for the think tank Civitas, he said: ‘The licence fee has just reached the end of its natural lifespan. It's already 88 years old and she will be well into her 90s by the time of charter renewal.’

At the time the BBC said a subscription model would lead to ‘more expensive fees paid for by fewer people’.
