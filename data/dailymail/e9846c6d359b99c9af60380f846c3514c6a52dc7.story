The morning after the night before, and Captain Fantastic had turned into Captain Recall. No hazy memories for Paul McGinley about what went on following Europe’s marvellous Ryder Cup victory on Sunday.

‘My wife gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever had in my life after sinking the winning putt in 2002,’ said the Dubliner. ‘Don’t drink too much or you’ll forget about it. Have a few drinks, of course, but remember these moments, they’re special. And last night was special.’

And so he told us about the moment Sir Alex Ferguson came into the room and thanked the whole team for making him feel young again. ‘He said it had been like being back in the boiler room again and he thanked us for the pleasure,’ said McGinley, beaming.

He told of the conversation he was having with Sergio Garcia and the fateful moment when, for the only time all night, he looked at the screen of his permanently buzzing smartphone. It was a text from Luke Donald, friend of Sergio and the man McGinley had reluctantly left on the sidelines.

‘I don’t want to break too many confidences but it was just very respectful to me, very respectful to the team and very regretful that he wasn’t part of it,’ he said. ‘It was just nice. It was a big, long text, and it meant a lot.’

Europe has been blessed with some wonderful captains over the years but McGinley might just have been the best since Tony Jacklin. The respect his players had for him can be summed up by a lovely anecdote concerning Ian Poulter.

Imagine what it must have been like for him when he was left out of the Saturday afternoon foursomes matches, having just chipped in at the 15th during the morning, meaning he would play only three times?

‘It was a really tough call, but I just decided at the 11th hour to play Martin Kaymer and break up that dynamic of Poulter and Justin Rose in the foursomes,’ said McGinley. ‘The way Ian accepted that decision... I mean he came out on the golf course in the afternoon, he put his arm around my shoulder and said: ‘‘You’re the captain, you make the calls and I’ll be ready tomorrow’’. That told me more about Ian Poulter than the banging on the heart or what he did at Medinah.’

The party began with just the team, caddies, Sir Alex and other friends and wives. ‘It wasn’t too packed and it was just nice with no one looking for selfies or autographs,’ said McGinley. ‘A lot of the players then joined the Americans in their team room where we got our asses truly whipped at table tennis. I’m certainly glad the Ryder Cup is not a table tennis championship! Then we went out into the bar and public areas. So we moved around, but we started out initially just being together, which was great. A little moment to savour.’

McGinley’s attention to detail didn’t just extend to having the two European team room areas redecorated in blue and gold. He even had a fish tank put in, complete with blue and gold fish.

‘I just wanted everything in the team room to be the European colours and symbolise our coming together, and everyone bought into it,’ he said. ‘That’s what we do. We come from such diverse cultures and backgrounds but we stand together as one, from the bottom of Italy to the top of Sweden, from the West Coast of Ireland right across to Turkey. And as for the fish, yeah, that was my idea. They’re still swimming away happily although they might have hangovers as some of the wine might have been spilled over them.’

Whoever takes over from McGinley is going to have enormous shoes to fill but he confirmed he would not be standing again in any capacity, either as captain or vice-captain.

‘I feel like I made the natural progression from player to vice-captain to captain — and that will be it for me,’ he said.

McGinley will, however, be part of the new selection process that will decide on his successor, who will be announced early in the new year. The new five-man committee comprises the last three captains, George O’Grady, chief executive of the European Tour, plus an as yet undetermined member of the Tournament Players’ Committee.

The choice is likely to come down between Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez.

As for the future of the Ryder Cup, McGinley has no fears people will lose interest with Europe winning so often. ‘Everything is going in an upwards direction, from the viewing figures around the world to commercial revenue to general media interest,’ he said. ‘Then you’ve got American pride. They will galvanise themselves. And then you’ve got the fans. Weren’t they amazing?

‘I feel such pride about this Ryder Cup, not on the inside but being able to look around and see people bursting with joy, the spectators high- fiving each other in the stands and everyone with a smile on their face. Everyone is so wrapped up in it and loves it so much, I can’t see a single valid reason why it would decline.’

As for his own future, McGinley is looking forward to playing free of distractions after two years when he has put his heart and soul into the captaincy. He might even play in the Dunhill Links at St Andrews this week. ‘Goodness knows what my swing would be like,’ he said.

But his Ryder Cup race is now run, and what a journey it was. Three times a player, twice a vice-captain and finally a captain, with six victories to show from those six Ryder Cups.

McGinley leaned forward and placed his hand against Sam Ryder’s precious trophy.

‘Wow. I’ve been a lucky man,’ he said.
