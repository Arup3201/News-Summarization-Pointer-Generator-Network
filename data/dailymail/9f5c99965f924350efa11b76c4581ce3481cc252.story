Paul Lambert would be well advised to dip into the transfer market for a striker, because if Aston Villa carry on at this rate they will earn the dubious title of becoming the worst attacking team in Premier League history.

It’s no secret that Villa have struggled for goals this season, netting just 11 times in 23 games, but their inadequacies are laid bare when compared with previous problem strikeforces.

The infamous Derby County side of 2007-08 – relegated after failing to compete all season, winning just once – managed more goals per game than Lambert’s side are currently trundling along at.

Their drought now stands at 10 hours and 12 minutes. It’s led to growing calls for Lambert to be shown the door by Randy Lerner, but the Scot appears to be safe for now.

Incidentally, Derby scored 20 times that fateful season under Billy Davies and Paul Jewell.  

Villa need nine more to draw level with 15 games remaining. They wouldn’t even manage that if nothing changed.

The teams currently have an identical record after 23 games which, given the Rams’ terrible run of form, makes very grim reading indeed. 

The two teams have the joint-worst record at this stage. 

Lambert has wanted to land a striker this month but it remains to be seen whether he can get a body in to truly compete with Christian Benteke.

One of the major problems for Villa, of course, has been the failure to get the Belgian firing after he recovered from injury. 

They need to get someone in, otherwise the responsibility to score more goals befalls Andreas Weimann and Gabriel Agbonlahor; nobody wants that. 

The pair are Lambert's top scorers in the league. 

Three each after playing more than 40 games combined.

It is a shambolic return and one which doesn't appear ready to change any time soon, with Chelsea to come next weekend.
