Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced an official memorial for the Australian victims of MH17  

Nearly 300 people, including 37 Australian citizens and permanent residents, died when a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine two weeks ago.

The service was being held in Melbourne because 16 of the victims came from Victoria, Mr Abbott said.

On the day of the service, flags on all Australian government buildings, here and overseas, will be flown at half-mast.

Arrangements have been made for an outside broadcast in anticipation of large crowds.

Among the large Victorian death toll was Shaliza Dewal, 45, and her Dutch husband Hans Van Den Hende.

The Malaysian-Dutch couple were travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with their three children, Piers, 15, Marnix, 12, and daughter Margaux, 8 but never made it home.

The news comes after a five-nation team, led by the Dutch and including Australian Federal Police, was blocked from entering the crash site in the Donetsk region for a fourth time.

Australian and Dutch police investigators were forced to abandon the search for remains again on Wednesday because of fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist fighters.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said claims investigators are being deterred from the MH17 crash site by land mines are 'utterly despicable'.

Ms Bishop said she is aware of reports that Ukrainian rebels have been laying land mines on roads through to the crash site of the downed flight in eastern Ukraine.

The claims were reportedly by made a Ukrainian military spokesman.

'I don't know if those reports are confirmed,' she told ABC radio on Thursday.

'If that is true, it is utterly despicable.'

Ms Bishop said new information suggesting remains of up to 80 bodies were still on the site has made the joint team even more resolute and desperate to gain access.

'It's heartbreaking, it's so distressing.

'We have the team in place, we have the experts ready to work, and we can't get to the site.'

The foreign minister is concerned that Russia could be actively undermining the access process.

The Ukrainian government had been offering strong support for a humanitarian corridor and ceasefire.

'We sent out a team in advance and they get halfway down the road ... sometimes three quarters of the way ... and then the shelling starts.

'Whilst I can't point the finger at who starts the shelling, we get absolute assurances from the Ukraine government that it's not them.'

The joint team is also determined to retrieve a large pile of victims' belongings from a morgue in the rebel-stronghold of Donestk, where it's believed some of the bodies had been at one point.

The belongings will be sent to the Netherlands, where body identification is taking place.
