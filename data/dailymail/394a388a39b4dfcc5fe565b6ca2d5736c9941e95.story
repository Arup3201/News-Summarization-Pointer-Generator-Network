Phil Neville has claimed that Wayne Rooney can become a Manchester United legend, and even achieve 'statue status' at the club.

The former United defender spoke in glowing terms about the club's new captain, and claimed the former Evertonian could be on a par with the club's greatest ever players if he wants.

'If you break Bobby Charlton's record at Manchester United you're talking statue status,' Neville told The Mirror. 

'Because he's an all-time great. People like Wayne Rooney, that's what gets his juices flowing. When I say statue material I mean becoming a great.

Success: Wayne Rooney has won five Premier League titles since joining Manchester United

'There have been brilliant players who have played for Man United but you're talking about all-time United greats - Law, Best, Charlton, Ferguson. And Giggs is in that category also.'

Denis Law, George Best, Bobby Charlton and Alex Ferguson all have statues already and Neville believes Rooney can join that elite group if he works hard enough. 

'Rooney will be aiming to break records to put him up there with the greatest,' said Neville. 'That's got to be his challenge over the next five years.' 

Rooney has enjoyed considerable success since joining the club as a teenager from Everton back in 2004. The 28-year-old has won five Premier League titles, two League Cups, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup.
