Former President George H.W. Bush is back on the town as he was spotted dining in a Houston restaurant two weeks after being released from the hospital.

The Republican President was treated in the local Methodist Hospital for two months because of a bronchitis-related cough and other health issues.

The health troubles appeared to be well out of sight over the weekend, however, as happy diners spotted the former President and took a picture alongside him.

The 88-year-old looks a bit startled but happy in the photo, which was then posted onto local news anchor Janet Shamlian's Instagram and Twitter accounts.

Mr Bush, who is the oldest-living President, initially went into the hospital on November 23, and was upgraded to intensive care one month later because his condition worsened.

Physicians said that they were having difficulty controlling a fever that developed after the cough improved.

His office said on December 29 that he 
had been moved back to a regular hospital room. Since then, his 
condition has continued to improve and he has been undergoing physical 
therapy to rebuild his strength.

He suffers from a form of Parkinson's 
disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter 
or wheelchair to get around.

Because of his condition, it was the first time that the senior President Bush missed an inauguration since 1997, as both he and his son former President George W. Bush were no-shows at President Obama's second inaugural on January 21.

Mr Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston during the winter and spend their summers at a home in Kennebunkport, Maine.

On January 6, they celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary. They are the longest-married presidential couple.
