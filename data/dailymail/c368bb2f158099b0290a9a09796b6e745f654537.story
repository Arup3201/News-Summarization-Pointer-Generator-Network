A bigamist married his second wife on the same beach in Mexico where he honeymooned with the first - who only found out about his latest wedding when she went on Facebook.

Adrian Linham, 43, secretly dated Hayley Totterdell for three years while his loyal wife of seven years Liz, 37, thought their marriage was running smoothly.

He spent a lot of time away from the couple's marital home near Bristol saying he was working in Bangor, north Wales for his job as a scuba diving instructor.

But was actually splitting his time and living just 16 miles away with Hayley - who he then married in Riviera Maya, the same place he had honeymooned with his first wife.

Hayley's family and friends were all blissfully unaware he was already married.

Liz knew nothing about the ceremony until she received a letter from her mother-in-law saying she was sorry to see they had divorced and Adrian had remarried.

Adrian Linham married wife Liz in Weston-Super-Mare in 2007 before the couple honeymooned in Mexico

But after several years of marriage, Linham met Hayley Totterdell, who he then married at the same resort he had visited with his previous wife six years earlier

Liz then went online and found dozens of pictures of her grinning husband embracing his new bride - on the same beach where they went on honeymoon.

Scuba diving instructor Linham even had the same best man at both weddings.

Linham has now been jailed for 18 weeks for bigamy - but new wife Hayley is sticking by her husband.

Linham has two children from a previous partner and one with Liz, while Hayley has two children from a previous husband.

Mother-of-one Liz said: 'I didn't think stuff like this happened in real life and I certainly didn't think it would ever happen to me.

'I genuinely didn't know what was going on. I never thought for a moment that he'd gone and married someone else.

Liz has spoken of the extent of Linham's lies after he was jailed for bigamy this week

'It has completely altered the way I look at everyone. I look at people now, who I have known and trusted for years, and think 'can I really trust you'?.'

Liz and Adrian met at his brother's wedding in 2000 and became an item in July 2006 after he divorced his first wife.

They got engaged in 2007 and married just months later at Rookery Manor in Somerset before jetting off to Riviera Maya in Mexico for their honeymoon.

But throughout their relationship, Linham would stay at their marital home near Bristol less and less - sometimes coming home as little as once or twice a month.

In spite of this Liz thought their marriage was still going strong and she gave up work to look after their daughter, now aged four.

'He would tell me he loved me every day and he'd say how he couldn't be without me,' she said.

But she was shocked to discover that he had been leading a double life and had been seeing Hayley Totterdell for more than three years.

Liz was aware of Hayley's existence but had been told she was merely the wife of Linham's psychiatrist.

Hayley was blissfully unaware that Adrian was already married and only found out about his previous marriage when he was arrested.

They are believed to have got engaged in August 2012 after he proposed on the same beach where he honeymooned with Liz.

Then, in May 2014, Linham told Liz he was going away for a longer stretch in Bangor to oversee exams - but actually flew back to Mexico for his wedding to Hayley.

None of Hayley's family knew he was already married and he is believed to have told best man Mark Stapleton that he had already divorced Liz.

After the wedding Adrian returned to the UK and carried on living his double life as if nothing had changed.

Liz only found out about the wedding three months later when she received a letter from Adrian's mum, who she had not spoken to for a while.

'I got a letter from his mum on 21 August 2014,' she said. 'It said that she was sorry to hear Adrian and I had gotten divorced and that she hoped I was dealing with it ok.'

She then went on to say that she had been on Facebook and seen Linham's wedding pictures to Hayley and hoped that his new marriage hadn't affected me too much.' 

Linham is believed to have got engaged to Hayley in 2014, when he proposed on the same beach he and Liz had visited shortly after they were married in 2007

Neither his not Hayley's family were aware of his secret wife at the ceremony at the same resort later that year

She added: 'It was such a huge shock to me, I went on to Facebook and found the pictures pretty much straight away.

'I didn't read the whole letter - I tore it up into tiny pieces and threw it away, I had just picked out certain parts of the letter.

'Those parts of the letter are still whirling around in my head, especially the bit about 'Mrs Hayley Linham' - she took his name.' 

Liz added: 'I called him to confront him but he yet again denied it - I just went into meltdown.

'He totally denied it and told me not to be so silly. But that was it - I haven't spoken to him since.

'It's just been like a total nightmare. I actually remember saying this is the kind of thing you'd read about in the newspapers and magazines.'

Liz has since discovered the catalogue of lies which Adrian told her in order to conduct his secret double life.

She recalled how she waited at home all day one Christmas Day for Adrian to return home only for him to arrive late in the evening.

Linham told his wife he was away for work but was secreting living at his bride-to-be Hayley's house (pictured) - which is on the other side of Bristol from his marital home with Liz

It later transpired he had spent the day with Hayley before telling her his mum had died in order to duck out and return to his wife.

He then returned home to Hayley, describing his mother's funeral in full detail - despite the fact she is still alive.

In December 2013 Liz suffered a miscarriage at 7pm one evening but Adrian left her by 7am the next morning to go and see Hayley.

The love rat also tricked Liz into redecorating Hayley's second home in Swanage, Dorset - asking her to paint the bedroom, and her children's bedrooms, convincing her it was his boss' home.

Liz said: 'I'd always known about Hayley but the way he'd speak of her was just "oh she's loaded, her and her husband have got more money than sense so I do as many jobs as possible at their house to rinse them".

'He even took me to Hayley's second home in Swanage on two separate occasions, the first time I actually helped him set up for a party he was throwing for her and the second time I helped him redecorate.

'I painted her bedroom and both of her children's bedrooms as he told me it was his bosses house and we could stay there if we painted.'

Liz had no idea her husband was seeing another woman and believed their marriage was still going strong

Linham had the same best man, Mark Stapleton, at both weddings, but Mr Stapleton is believed to have been completely unaware he had not divorced Liz

Liz was so furious she reported his actions to the police and he pleaded guilty to one count of bigamy at North Somerset Courthouse in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, yesterday.

Chair of the bench, Peter Searle, sentenced Linham to 17 weeks in prison and ordered him to pay £1,000 compensation and put into place a restraining order.

He told Linham, who has two children from a previous relationship: 'The length of deception is nothing short of incredible. You have shown no remorse and have humiliated your wife.'

Sue Baker, defending, told the court he admitted bigamy when he was arrested and intended to get divorced from his first wife when he returned from the wedding 'but he was putting the cart before the horse'.

Linham has now begun divorce proceedings, the court heard.
