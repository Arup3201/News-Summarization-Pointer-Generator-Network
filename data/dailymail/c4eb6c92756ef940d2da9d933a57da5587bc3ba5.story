The NSA is listening in on every cell phone call made within or to the Bahamas, according to revelations contained with the documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

As part of a program codenamed SOMALGET, the National Security Agency is recording millions of communications in the nation of 370,000 and they're even able to replay a given conversation for a month after it happens.

Bahamian leaders did not authorize the surveillance, the extent of which goes far beyond the metadata spying that's known to have been down in the U.S. and a slew of other countries.

Revealed: Documents have now revealed that the NSA has been monitoring and recording every cell phone call made in the nation of the Bahamas, population 370,000

According to The Intercept, the documents specify that the United States is monitoring the Caribbean country in order to locate 'international narcotics traffickers and special-interest alien smugglers.'

The SOMALGET program is part of a broader program codenamed MYSTIC.

The expansive parent program monitors communication metadata for several other nations including Mexico, Kenya and the Philippines.

In addition to the 'full-take audio' monitoring of the Bahamas, SOMALGET also records calls in a second nation which The Intercept declined to name due to 'credible concerns that doing so could lead to increased violence.'

The MYSTIC monitoring covers countries whose combined populations are around 250 million.

The report even notes that the NSA is in search of funding to export the surveillance program to even more countries.

Widespread: The revelation came Monday from papers leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The initiative is codenamed SOMALGET and part of a broader program called MYSTIC that's also monitoring metadata of telecom in the nations of Mexico, Kenya and the Philippines
