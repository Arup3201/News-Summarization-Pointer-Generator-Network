A dad-of-six says he was 48 hours away from death after medics repeatedly mistook his life-threatening bowel condition for stomach ache.

Stuart Pashley, 47, from Clay Cross in Derbyshire was sent away with painkillers twice by doctorsÂ  when he complained of chronic abdominal pain.

He also claims that he was told by one GP not to go to hospital because 'sickness bugs can close hospital wards and kill people'.

Family man: Stuart Pashley is pictured with his wife Lisa and his two-year-old son William enjoying each day after he nearly died because his bowel burst and doctors mistook his symptoms for a stomach bug

But six days after his symptoms started, a third doctor sent him to hospital where he was diagnosed with a life-threatening bowel condition and had surgery to remove part of his colon.

He also had to have a colostomy bag fitted.

Mr Pashley said: 'I was in a coma for two days to recover from the operation.

'But when I came round the consultant surgeon told me that if I hadn't come in it would have been less than 48 hours and I would be dead.

'It didn't really sink in until later when I thought I have a wife and young children and that could have all been gone.'

The doting father has six children, William, two, Amber, six, Eboni, nine, Laura, 22, Zoey, 24, and Vikki, 26.

Treatment: Six days after his symptoms started, a third doctor sent him to hospital where he was diagnosed with a life-threatening bowel condition and had surgery to remove part of his colon

Coma: The 47-year-old, from Clay Cross, Derbyshire was put into a medically induced coma for two days to recover after surgery

He was diagnosed with suffering from severe diverticulitis, which causes pockets to form in the colon that collect waste and can eventually burst.

He added: 'I knew from the moment the pain started it was more than a stomach ache.

'Since the operation I have been on forums and I have seen people say the pain is worse than childbirth. I was bent over, crying with the pain.'

Mr Pashley initially phoned the NHS 111 helpline on March 7, after waking with abdominal pain, sickness and diarrhoea.

He was told to keep up with fluids and take painkillers by the adviser and see a doctor if he was still in pain the following Monday.

Three days later, and still in pain, he was visited by a doctor from Clay Cross Medical Centre who echoed the words of the 111 adviser and warned him 'not to go to hospital as sickness bugs can close wards and kill people'.

The next day, Mr Pashley awoke with severe pains in his abdomen and his wife Lisa, 33, who works in local government, called for an ambulance.

Mr Pashley said: 'My wife rang 999 and was told by the operator, because my condition was not life threatening, an ambulance could not be sent and if we wanted to go to A&E we would have to make our own way there.'

Moments later, his wife phoned the non-emergency line 111 and was told an ambulance would be sent out.

Advice: Mr Pashley launched a complaint against Clay Cross Medical Centre and says he has received a letter of apology, but wants to urge people to trust their instincts when it comes to their health

The paramedic rang Mr Pashley's GP and said that he would need stronger painkillers, so he booked in for another appointment the following day.

When he arrived the next afternoon, he was 'doubled over with abdominal pain' but was still told to avoid A&E and was given high-strength painkiller, Tramadol.

Later that afternoon - and now in the 'worst pain' he had ever experienced - another doctor visited his home and, at last, decided to call for an ambulance.

He said: 'The next day I had a laparotomy and Hartmann's procedure for severe diverticulitis.

'I was told by the consultant surgeon that if I hadn't been admitted I would have been dead within 48 hours.'

Following the intense surgery to remove part of his colon, Mr Pashley was put into a medically induced coma for two days to recover.

He has launched a complaint against Clay Cross Medical Centre and says he has received a letter of apology, but wants to urge people to trust their instincts when it comes to their health.

He said: 'Listen to your GP, do what they say. But you know your own body so if you think you need it, get another opinion.'

A spokesperson for NHS England, said: 'We take extremely seriously incidents where patients suffer distress or harm whilst in the receipt of NHS care.

'We will be asking the practice to provide us with a copy of their formal response to the patient and, if appropriate, any performance concerns will be addressed.'
