Battle: The trial over the fortune of Huguette Clark, pictured, could now go ahead on Thursday

A trial to decide who will inherit the
$300 million estate of reclusive copper mining heiress Huguette Clark 
has been put on hold for two days in a last-ditch effort to reach a 
settlement.

Attorneys said that jury selection - which was supposed 
to begin on Tuesday - has now been delayed until Thursday to allow more 
time for negotiations.

The office of the New York attorney general, 
Eric Schneiderman, is trying to broker a settlement, attorneys told NBC 
News.

His office's Charities Bureau has made previous attempts, but 
Clark's relatives, who were left with nothing in the will, have
not been able to reach an agreement with the beneficiaries.

The case, which involves more than 60 lawyers, concerns the last will of Clark, who owned lavish properties from New York's Fifth Avenue to the California coast but opted to spend her last 20 years in a Manhattan hospital. She died in 2011, at age 104.

The dispute pits nearly two dozen of Clark's distant relatives against a goddaughter, the hospital, a nurse, doctors, a lawyer, an accountant, and other professionals and aides who benefited from her April 2005 will, which left nothing to her family.

Gifts to Clark's chief nurse included 
multiple Manhattan apartments and a $1.2 million Stradivarius violin. 
Her primary doctor received cash Christmas presents totaling $500,000, 
among other gifts.

The hospital got hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a $3.5 million painting by French pre-Impressionist Edouard Manet.

'The persons and institution named herein as beneficiaries of my estate are the true objects of my bounty,' the will said, noting that the childless, briefly married Clark had had only 'minimal contacts' with her relatives over the years.

But it was signed just six weeks after another version of her will, which left almost all her money to the family members. They're descendants of her half-siblings.

The relatives say a coterie of hospital executives, medical professionals and Clark's lawyer and accountant took advantage of their access to the secluded, aged heiress to manipulate their way into her millions of dollars.

The beneficiaries say Clark was simply a generous woman who wanted to help those who helped her.

Clark's father, U.S. Sen. William A. Clark, was one of the richest Americans of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

He served as a senator from Montana, where he initially made his fortune from copper mines.

His business empire later grew to include building a Western rail line and establishing a Nevada railroad town called Las Vegas. The surrounding Clark County is named for him.

The trial will decide only whether Huguette Clark's April 2005 will is valid. But testimony might also peer into pricey presents her caregivers and advisers received while she was alive.

'There may be some connection between gift-giving and undue influence in the will,' Manhattan Surrogate's Court Judge Nora Anderson said at a pretrial hearing Friday.

Ahead of the trial, a new biography about Clark was released and offered tantalizing 
details about the French-born heiress who was fixated on 
life-like dolls and building miniature castles - often splashing out 
thousands of dollars to make them.

The book, Empty Mansions: The 
Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American 
Fortune by Bill Dedman and one of Clark's relatives Paul Clark Newell 
Jr., lifts the lid on the fascinating family known for staying out of 
the limelight.

According to the Post,
one of the few people who visited Clark at her apartments in the 1950s 
said that a long gallery was lined with dolls, each seated on its own 
sumptuous armchair.

One of Ms Clark's few outings was to attend Christian Dior fashion shows in order to find clothes to dress her dolls.

The heiress was also obsessed with building miniature models.

A
lover of Japanese culture, although she never traveled, Clark paid for 
someone to travel to Japan to photograph and note the specifications of 
the castles she wanted to build from the confines of her mansion.Â 

While she stayed at the hospital, her
three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a 
$24million country house in Connecticut and a $100million co-op, the 
largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park.

She
inherited her wealth from her father, Montana Senator William Clark, 
and his copper mines but regarded her great wealth as 'a menace to 
happiness'.

When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees.
