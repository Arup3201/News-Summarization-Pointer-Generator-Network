Whitgift proved hospitable and formidable opponents in toppling Sedbergh in the first big weekend of Daily Mail Schools Trophy action this season.

This eagerly-awaited south-north battle produced a memorable contest with victory going to Croydon-based Whitgift, 24-22, following a late penalty from centre Alex Hogg.

The Cumbrian visitors were treated to a chicken dinner on arrival in south London, but Whitgift’s hospitality stopped on pitch the next day where a last-gasp effort brought a first win over Sedbergh.

Sedbergh, who were runners up to Woodhouse Grove last season, had looked set to maintain dominance over Whitgift when establishing a 22-13 lead following tries by captain Freddie Renwick, full-back Jonny McPhillips and lock Max Davies.

But Whitgift struck back through tries by wings George Pearson and Ben Donohue backed up by the goal-kicking of Hogg who contributed 14 points.

‘We never gave up and our ‘scramble’ defence was very good,’ admitted Chris Wilkins, Whitgift’s director of rugby. ‘Sedbergh always treat us very well when we go up to their place so we reciprocated with dinner for the two teams and staff the night before. ‘The two schools have the same ethos about the game and always get on well,’ Wilkins added.

Sedbergh’s Simon Mulholland felt his team had missed too many chances, especially in the first half. ‘We could have won but they finished the stronger.’ Victory for Whitgift gives them the launch pad to challenge for honours in the second season of the Trophy which is organised on a merit table basis by schoolsrugby.co.uk for the leading rugby-playing schools over the autumn term.

Whitgift are now building up to face another fancied team in Wellington later this month. Last season’s fourth-placed team avenged defeat by RGS High Wycombe last September thanks to a late try from England under-16 centre Matt Williams. His fine effort earned a 22-19 win, wing Tom Parton contributing two tries.

Champions Woodhouse Grove may be rebuilding after the success of last season, but they continued their winning ways by beating Ashville College, 40-3. They expect a tougher test at Yorkshire rivals, St Peter’s, on Saturday.

Newcastle RGS and Durham stage the first competitive match on the new artificial pitch at Kingston Park on Friday, kick off 7pm.

These north-east rivals have had contrasting starts to the season. While RGS toppled George Watson’s College, one of Scotland’s top teams, 10-0, in Edinburgh, Durham lost to neighbours Barnard Castle, 23-0.

Barnard Castle followed up by beating Yarm, 33-27. Wing Jack Hedley, who scored two tries against Durham, added a third of the season so far.
