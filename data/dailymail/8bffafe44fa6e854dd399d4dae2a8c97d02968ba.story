Thirty-three North Koreans face 
execution after being charged with attempting to overthrow the repressive regime of Kim Jong-un. The
 Koreans have landed themselves in hot water after it emerged they had 
worked with South Korean Baptist missionary Kim Jung-wook and received 
money to set up 500 underground churches. It is understood they will be 
put to death in a cell at the State Security Department.

Experts believe the North Koreans are 
being punished more harshly than usual as North Korean leader Kim 
Jong-un combats a wave of dissatisfaction at the regime's isolationist 
"juche" doctrine.

Sorry: Kim Jung Wook, a South Korean Baptist missionary, says he is sorry for his 'anti-state crimes'

Interrogated: The missionary speaks under the portrait of late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il during a news conference in Pyongyang

Missionary
 Kim Jung-wook was arrested and jailed last year for allegedly trying to
 establish underground churches. Last week he held a press conference 
at which he apologized for committing "anti-state" crimes and appealed 
for his release from North Korean custody.

He
 told reporters that he was arrested in early October after entering the
 North from China and trying to make his way to Pyongyang with Bibles, 
Christian instructional materials and movies.

Kim Jung-wook said he had received assistance from South Korea's intelligence agency.

"I
 was thinking of turning North Korea into a religious country, and 
destroying its present government and political system," he said at the 
time.

"I received money from the intelligence services and followed 
instructions from them, and arranged North Koreans to act as their 
spies. And I also set up an underground church in China, in Dandong, and
 got the members to talk and write, for me to collect details about the 
reality of life in North Korea, and I provided this to the intelligence 
services."

A South Korean 
intelligence source in China took issue with Kim's account, saying that 
the missionary did not enter North Korea voluntarily, but was kidnapped 
by agents of the Pyongyang government in China.

During Kim Jung-wook's press conference,
 North Korean officials also showed video of North Koreans who confessed
 to coming into contact with the missionary.

The North Korean newspaper
 Chosun Ilbo reported that they said that Kim told them to build a 
church on the site where a massive statue of North Korea's founder, Kim 
Il-Sung, stands in Pyongyang whenever the regime falls.

North
 Korea continues to hold Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae, who was
 detained while leading a group on a tour of North Korea in 2012 and 
later sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Bae
 was moved to a hospital last summer in poor health, but said at the 
news conference that he was being transferred back to prison.

Treachery: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Choe Ryong Hae pictured in July last year, before rumours of a disappearance surfaced

Kim Jong Un is fast gaining a reputation for brutality and destroying those closest to him.

Yesterday
 there were reports that North Korea's number two leader Choe Ryong 
Hae's had disappeared and there are fears that he is the lastest to be 
purged.

Choe is said 
to have displeased the leader by taking management of several 
state-owned industries. It is understood that Choe is in jail and being 
interrogated.

Choe held several top 
positions in the North Korean leadership after Kim ordered the 
high-profile execution of Jang Song Thaek, the previous incumbent and 
Kim's uncle and mentor.

Kim's uncle Jang, 67, was executed in December, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime.

Jang was married to Kim Kyong Hui, Kim's aunt and former leader Kim Jong-Il's sister and was killed by firing squad.

It has since been claimed that members
 of his uncle's family were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest
 and subsequent death in December.

Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren were condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea.

As
 well as his uncle, other high-ranking members of the military have been
 purged by Kim Jong-Un, including three defence ministers and three 
chiefs of the army's general staff.

Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him.

In
 August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra -
 which included the dictator's ex-girlfriend - were reportedly publicly 
machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming 
themselves naked.

There are said to have been between 40 to 80 public mass executions in North Korea in 2013.
