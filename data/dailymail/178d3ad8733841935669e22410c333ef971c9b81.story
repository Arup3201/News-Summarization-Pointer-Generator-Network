Marvel Comics has announced the new Captain America will be African-American for the first time in the comic franchise's history.

Sam Wilson, also known as The Falcon, a crime-fighting partner of the original 'Cap' Steve Rogers, will be taking over the reins in the 'All-New Captain America' which is due to be released in November.

Wilson is stepping in for Rogers after the original superhero lost his special powers and youth last month.

The news comes in the same week comic book fans were rocked by an unexpected move by Marvel, when it revealed that Thor is now a woman.

Marvel executive editor Tom Brevoort said Wilson's move to become Captain America 'shouldn't be seen as revolutionary.'

'It's about time. In 2014, this should be a thing that we shrug off, it shouldn't be seen as revolutionary, but it still feels exciting,' the New York Daily News quoted him as saying.

The move was revealed by Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada on The Colbert Report last night.

The change however will only be made on the page at the moment, with actor Chris Evans due to continue portraying the superhero on the big screen.

Writer Rick Remander told Marvel.com: 'I think that it’s important with these stories to do things that are natural and make sense and have an inherent logic to the universe, but are also constantly shifting and exciting, keeping the drama high.

'In order to do that it really comes down to creating new dynamics.'

On Tuesday it was reported that Marvel was experimenting with bringing in a new audience after revealing hammer-wielding superhero Thor is now a woman.

Reaction to the proposed change was mixed, with fans taking to Marvel's Facebook page to rail against changes to their childhood heroes.

Many questioned how the plot line will allow for this mysterious woman to take over the hammer of Thor, speculating on whether she is a long-lost relative.

But Marvel has said simply that the new character using the power of Mjölnir - the hammer - is Thor.

'This new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!' Marvel editor Wil Moss said.

'The inscription on Thor's hammer reads "Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor." Well it's time to update that inscription.'

In a statement Marvel said the new look Thor will be the eighth lead female protagonist, as the publisher tries to open up comics to more women.
