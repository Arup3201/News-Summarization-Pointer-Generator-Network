The Commonwealth Games have been hit by yet another drugs scandal after former world champion Amantle Montsho tested positive for a banned stimulant following the women’s 400 metres final on Tuesday.

The 31-year-old Botswanan, who lost her world title in Moscow last year to Britain’s Christine Ohuruogu by four thousandths of a second, is the second athlete to fail a doping test in Glasgow.

Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha, 16, has already been stripped of her gold medal in the 53kg category after her A and B samples showed traces of a banned diuretic and masking agent.

Montsho’s A sample was found to contain methylhexaneamine, a banned stimulant that gives the body an energy boost by increasing its metabolic rate.

The 2010 400m Commonwealth champion, who has been provisionally suspended after finishing fourth on Tuesday night, has asked for her B sample to be tested in London on Monday.

Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake, Usain Bolt’s training partner, missed the 2009 World Championships in Berlin and served a three-month ban after testing positive for methylhexaneamine, which can be found in some dietary supplements and is commonly used as a nasal decongestant, in June that year.

Nigerian sprinter Damola Osayemi was also stripped of the 2010 Commonwealth 100m title after traces of the stimulant were found in her system.

A spokesman for the Botswana team said: ‘There is nothing clear for now.

‘We’re hoping that in a few days we will see where it came from and what’s going to happen. It’s not that she’s been banned, just that she’s suspended prior to the investigation.’

Making sure: The 31-year-old will have her B sample tested on Monday
