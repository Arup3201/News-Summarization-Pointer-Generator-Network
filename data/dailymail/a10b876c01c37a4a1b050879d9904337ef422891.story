Women who carry HPV (pictured) are at greater risk of heart disease a study shows and the HPV vaccine is being cited as a preventative measure

Women who carry the  human papillomavirus (HPV) are more than twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those who test negative, a study shows.

Researchers at the University of Texas discovered those who test positive for HPV - one of the most common sexually transmitted infections - are also at greater risk from heart disease.

Although long-term studies are needed to confirm the link, scientists are already citing the HPV vaccine as a preventative measure.

The HPV vaccine protects against two types of human papilloma virus that are responsible for 70 per cent of cervical cancer.

Data from around 2,500 women 
between the ages of 20 and 59 was gathered from a
2003 - 2006 U.S. National Health Survey and Nutrition Examination Survey.

In total 44.6 per cent carried some form of HPV while 23.2 per cent had the cancer-causing strains of the virus.

After assessing medical history and lifestyle patterns the team discovered the two well known 'cancer-causing' strains of HPV were 'strongly associated' with heart disease.

Women who tested positive for any of 
the 37 strains of the virus were 2.3 times 
more likely to have had either a heart attack or stroke while women who tested positive for 
cancer-causing strains had 2.86 times
the risk of heart disease.

Lead author Dr Ken Fujise said: 'I thought there would be a weak link 
between HPV and cardiovascular disease, but I didn't expect [the risk] 
to be 2.3 times as high.'

The study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, was aimed at discovering why almost 20 per cent of those who develop 
heart disease do not present traditional risk factors, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure.

Dr Fujise
said that the new research indicates that HPV could be the nontraditional factor responsible.

He added: 'This is very first study to link HPV with [heart disease].

'However, our data suggests those 
patients should be followed more closely by their doctors â€” if [they] 
have chest pain, take it very seriously.

'The HPV vaccine may also help prevent heart disease.'

Dr Nieca Goldberg, medical director at New York University told USA Today: 'It is great that researchers are thinking out of the box to assess cardiovascular risk in women.

'If more studies confirm these new research findings linking HPV to cardiovascular disease, this would be an additional tool for doctors to assess a women's cardiovascular risk.

'It would also get younger women to take their hearts seriously.'

Currently in the UK the HPV vaccine called Cervarix is offered to children aged 12 to 13 at school.
