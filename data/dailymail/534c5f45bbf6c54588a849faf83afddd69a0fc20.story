Alan Crickmore will be sentenced today for plundering the estates of dead trustees in a bid to relieve his own debt

One of Britain’s longest serving coroners has been jailed for plundering £2million from the estates of dead people.

Alan Crickmore, 57, received an eight-year sentence from a judge today following an 'absolutely chronic' string of deceitful crimes.

The coroner from Gloucestershire admitted theft and fraud by abuse of position after a two-year police investigation last month.

Southwark Crown Court heard today how the man continued to receive a £60,000 coroner salary for two years despite having his law firm closed down by the Solicitors 
Regulation Authority in 2010.

Crickmore was arrested in January 2011 following a two-year police probe into alleged irregularities at the firm, Alan C. Crickmore.

But the man only resigned from his role as coroner last month, after pleading guilty to 24 charges of dishonesty in a Gloucestershire court.

Crickmore started as deputy coroner for Gloucester in 1999 before becoming the city's coroner in 2002.

In 2005 he also took on the role of the coroner for the Cotswolds and combined the two jobs to become the first coroner to cover the whole of Gloucestershire.

Today, Prosecuting Mark Fenhalls told the court: ‘Mr Crickmore is a 57-year-old man who qualified as a solicitor in the 1980s and has been in practice in Gloucester since 1992.

‘He stole in various different ways about £2m from clients.

‘All of the money was stolen from clients either from their estates if they died or clients who were unable to understand.’

'He chose to target the weak, vulnerable and those who could not look after their own interests.'

Mr Fenhalls also described how the man used an 'entirely fraudulent' bookkeeping process to conceal his crimes.

Upon sentencing, Judge Anthony Leonard QC told Crickmore: 'The offences are so serious only a custodial sentence would be justified,' adding he had never before come across a case where a solicitor had been so dishonest.

'I am driven to conclude that you preferred to continue a life of dishonesty rather than lose your position in the community ... including your role as coroner.'

The court heard how Crickmore also took advantage of living clients, like 88-year-old dementia sufferer Clare Wilson who, in 2003, gave him power of attorney over her considerable assets.

The family of one of the people 
targeted by the conman said they are in discussions with solicitors to 
determine compensation for their ordeal.

Speaking outside court, Ian Goodwin said: 'I think justice has been served with Alan Crickmore.'

'But I'm very relieved the outcome has ended like this.'

Jane Mitchell, specialist fraud lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'For a period of 13 years between 1998 and 2011, Alan Crickmore abused his position to systematically steal from and defraud his clients in order to fund an extravagant lifestyle he plainly could not legitimately afford.

'It is no coincidence that his largest money transfers took place directly before the cruises he went on with his wife.'

In
 Crickmore's defence, Edward Henry told the court he had been 'in a trap
 of his own making for years, resulting in a significant effect on his 
mental and physical health. 

'He became a fraud to himself before he became a conman, I regret to submit, to his clients. 

'He embarked on a frenzied attempt to balance the books and this was absolutely chronic over a period of over a decade.

‘He has a significant history of depression and is completely broken by this.

‘He
 was made bankrupt in 2011 and discharged from bankruptcy in 2012 only 
because all of his assets were restrained for the purposes of 
confiscation.

'He is relieved he can now live with the truth, where he had to live with his deceit for so long.'

The defendant denied the prosecution's claims he enjoyed a 'lavish lifestyle that he couldn't afford', instead telling the court he stole as the result of his law firm's 'focus' on pro bono, coronal and charity work.

A compensation hearing has been scheduled for victims of Crickmore's crimes for next year.

At the time of his arrest, Crickmore was a director of the trust which runs the £13,000 St Edward's independent school in Charlton Kings, Cheltenham.

He was born in St Helen’s, Merseyside, in 1956 and qualified as a solicitor  when he was 24-years-old.

Assets worth £800,000 have since been frozen by officers, which include two properties in the names of his sons.

A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is due to take place on January 12, when it is hoped they will be seized and sold to recoup some of the clients’ lost money. They say Crickmore showed no remorse whatsoever.
