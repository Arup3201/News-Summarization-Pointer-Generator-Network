After a long winter and a spring that has barely sprung, many Britons will jet off to Europe today in search of a better bank holiday.

But according to forecasters they would be better off staying at home as Britain will bask in some of the warmest weather of the year so far – making it hotter and drier than parts of the Mediterranean this weekend.

The south is predicted to see temperatures of around 22C (72F) and could even exceed expectations and reach 23C (73F), making it the hottest day of the year so far.

Parts of northern England, Scotland, 
and Northern Ireland, however, may be hit by showers and the mercury 
will struggle to get above the mid-teens.

Tom Tobler, MeteoGroup forecaster, 
said: ‘The southern half of the country will get the best of the 
weather, especially as we get into Sunday and Monday, when it will be 
mostly fine and incredibly warm – on a par with parts of Majorca and 
other destinations in Europe.

‘Further north, in Scotland and Northern Ireland, there will be quite a lot of cloud and some showers.’

Forecasters said the bank holiday will
see the nicest weather of 2013 so far. The weekend will get gradually 
warmer, with much of the country reaching above 20C (68F) on Monday, 
compared to 16C (61F) on Majorca and 18C (64F) in the south of France, 
according to the Met Office.

Yesterday, supermarkets reported a 
surge in sales of outdoor grills and a nasal spray claiming to treat hay 
fever twice as fast as other drugs was launched as pollen levels 
hit a springtime peak.

Dymista, combining a corticosteroid 
and an antihistamine, will be available from GPs from today. The Met 
Office rated the pollen count ‘high’ for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

But with 7million people expected to 
take to the roads for the three-day getaway, there are warnings of 
travel chaos.

Police made the most of the weather today as they hit the streets wearing bright pink flip-flops.

Constabulary Sergeant Richard Holland and PCSO Rebecca Williams teamed 
the bizarre footwear with their usual uniforms as temperatures soared to
19C in Winchester, Hampshire.

Officers were showing support for 
Winchester Street Pastors, known informally as the ‘flip-flop and 
lollipop brigade’, who offer help to drunken revellers on nights out.

They give the flat footwear to girls 
struggling to get home in high heels - and lollipops are said to reduce 
the noise made by crowds leaving clubs, as they are too busy consuming 
them to shout.

The warm 
forecast - at least for the South - is good news for those planning to 
make trips. Drivers will be able to take advantage in the latest round 
of supermarket petrol and diesel reductions.

Meanwhile,
a survey of 2,000 parents by insurance company Elephant.co.uk found 
that children who become ill travelling in cars are likely to feel sick 
just 22 minutes into a journey.

The poll found that two in five families with children who get car sick avoid long journeys altogether.

In another survey, Autoglass revealed
that figures gathered from 14 police forces in England and Scotland 
showed 968 recorded incidents of motorists being attacked by missiles 
last year.

The figures, from a Freedom of Information Act request, also showed that arrests were made in 75 per cent of the incidents, which included bricks thrown from bridges. The 2012 statistics compared with a survey for 2011 which revealed 395 missile incidents following information from 10 forces.

Last year’s figures included 212 incidents recorded by Leicestershire Police, 190 by Nottinghamshire Police and 119 by Thames Valley Police. Avon and Somerset Constabulary recorded just six incidents.

Autoglass managing director Matthew Mycock said: ‘It is alarming to discover that the number of motorists attacked with bridge and roadside missiles is on the increase.’

Channel Tunnel high-speed train company Eurostar said it was set for its busiest weekend of the year, with more than 100,000 passengers expected to travel over the bank holiday weekend. The firm starts a new weekly direct service to Lyon and Provence in southern France on Saturday.

Not this year: Those who introduced the ban in 2012 affected the usage habits of 20million people

Water users are unlikely to face hosepipe bans this year, authorities said today.

A year ago, rate payers in some pockets of the UK were in the puzzling situation of having to endure water restrictions at a time of widespread heavy rainfall which contributed to 2012 being the second wettest year on record.

Those who introduced the ban last year affected the usage habits of 20million people.

But what may have seen like months of almost relentless rainfall have helped replenish stocks at reservoirs across the country, minimising the prospect of restrictions or droughts being declared this summer.

Victoria Williams, drought advisor at the Environment Agency, said: ‘Our latest water situation report details a positive outlook for water resources in the coming months.

‘(Last year) was the second wettest year on record, and despite a relatively dry start to 2013, river levels are normal or above normal at the majority of our monitoring sites.

‘The results show a positive picture even if rainfall is below average and point to the risk of drought this summer being no greater than average.

‘However it is still as important as ever to use water wisely. If the weather does turn hot and dry there could be localised impacts on rivers and the environment.’

Seven water companies - Thames, Southern Water, South East Water, Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia South East - introduced hosepipe bans in the spring of 2012.

It came after the unusually dry winters left some groundwater supplies and rivers as low as in the drought year of 1976.

But the restrictions introduced early in April were followed by record rainfall across the UK for that month and June, with more rain between them in May.

Most of the bans were lifted by early summer, while floods featured throughout November and December across some parts of the country.
