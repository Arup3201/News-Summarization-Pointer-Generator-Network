The wife of Minnesota State University football player Isaac Kolstad who was savagely beaten last month has given birth to their second child.

Molly Kolstad, a registered nurse, welcomed into the world on Wednesday a baby girl at the Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato where her husband remains in critical condition.

The 24-year-old linebacker suffered a fractured skull and traumatic brain injury in a May 11 fight in downtown Mankato that involved former Minnesota Gophers quarterback Philip Nelson.

The Kolstads also have a 3-year-old daughter together.

Hospital spokesman Kevin Burns told KTOE radio Thursday that both Molly Kolstad and her newborn daughter are doing well.

Besides the new addition to their family, Molly and Isaac received some good news this week from the injured football player's doctors.

In an online journal entry on the site CaringBridge.org, a family friend who has been giving updates on Kolstad's condition revealed Tuesday that Isaac was able to lift his left thumb on command.

Later in the day, however, Kolstad's loved ones asked for prayers, saying that the player has been diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis, raising concern that he might develop a pulmonary embolism – a potentially fatal condition where a blood clot becomes lodged in the heart or lungs.

Rutgers University quarterback Philip 
Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of 
third-degree assault.

Trevor Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts.

Mankato police used surveillance video to determine the identity of a man seen in a red shirt who allegedly punched Kolstad, the Mankato Department of Public Safety said last month. 

'Mr. Shelley was the individual we were looking for in the red shirt,' Todd Martin, Mankato’s public safety director, told the Star Tribune. 'We contacted him and then went to his residence and made the arrest.'

Shelley has multiple convictions, including driving on a suspended license and underage drinking and driving, the paper says.

Former Minnesota quarterback Philip Nelson leaves the Blue Earth County jail with a towel on his head

Nelson posted $20,00 bail in his assault case stemming from a fight outside a bar that left another former football player in critical condition with head injuries, in Mankato, Minnesota

According to a criminal complaint cited by NJ.com, 20-year-old Nelson was angry because a bouncer at a bar had hit on his girlfriend and he is extremely protective of the young woman.

Nelson's girlfriend told police that as they left the bar, they saw Mr Kolstad outside, the complaint says. The bouncer and Mr Kolstad are different people.

Nelson and Mr Kolstad got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer who had seen surveillance tapes, the complaint says.

Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that
 a man came 'out of nowhere' and punched Mr Kolstad in 
the head after he had left a bar in the early hours of Sunday.

'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.'

She added that the sound of Mr Kolstad hitting the concrete was so loud because he didn't catch himself.

Kolstad has bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint. Kolstad's skull fracture was on the left side of his head where he was kicked.

Mr Kolstad graduated in December 2013 with a degree in business management and works in sales at Fastenal, an industrial distribution company.

His father, Blaine, told WCCO that his son had been out with friends on the night of May 11 celebrating his graduation when he was attacked in a busy downtown area.

He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance.

Witnesses
 said that Mr Kolstad, who was described by a friend as 'a quiet, young 
man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in 
the South Street Saloon in the downtown area just before closing time. 
Mr Kolstad was found by police half a block from the bar.
