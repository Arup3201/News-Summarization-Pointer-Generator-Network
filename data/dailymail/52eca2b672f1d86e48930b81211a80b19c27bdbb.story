German side Union Berlin have allowed their supporters to bring sofas to their stadium so that they can watch the World Cup.

The club, who play in the second tier of German football, have transformed their Stadion An der Alten FÃ¶rsterei into a giant living room for the World Cup with around 850 couches dragged onto the pitch.

And if that didn't seem good enough already, they've also installed a 700-inch screen to watch every minute of the action from Brazil.

Comfy: A group of people relax and enjoy the World Cup on their sofa at the stadium

Dry: And yellow covers are provided to keep the couches dry in case it starts to rain

Around 12,000 fans attended the first game of the World Cup between the host nation and Croatia, with around 3,000 of them watching on sofas.

And there are even more expected for Germany's first game of the tournament against Portugal on Monday.

And they will round off the group stage with matches against Ghana and the USA.
