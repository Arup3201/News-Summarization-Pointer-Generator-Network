Jailed: Richen Turner. 45, spent seven years on the run before finally facing justice in the U.S.

A British woman has been jailed after spending seven years on the run from U.S. justice over a hit-and-run accident which killed a 39-year-old father.

Richen Turner, 45, was three times over the limit when she ran a red light and ploughed into Peter Cambra's vehicle in October 2005.

Mr Cambra died aged 39 when Turner, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire went through the traffic top at Atlantic Boulevard and Federal Highway in Pompano Beach, Florida, fatally colliding with his Cadillac.

Turner was driving a 1996 Ford Explorer without a licence and rolled several times before coming to a halt 200ft from the collision and suffered only minor injuries.

She fled back to the UK but was tracked down only after the Cambra family hired a private investigator and was finally extradited to the US in October 2012 to face charges after losing a lengthy legal battle.

Turner had claimed she was mentally ill and threatened to commit suicide if she was made to go back, but a judge ruled she must face charges relating to bodybuilder Mr Cambra's death.

Appearing in a Florida court on Thursday, Turner wept and apologised to the family of the victim before being jailed for six years.

During the hearing, Peter's son, Peter Cambra Jnr - who was just 16 when his father died - told Turner: ‘You took away someone who was not only a father, but just everything. He was a wonderful man.

‘I don't believe that any family or anyone should be wondering for a decade where you are or what you're doing, or why you didn’t just come forward.’

Tragedy: Father Peter Cambra was just 39 years old when he died in Florida in 2005 after Richen Turner crashed into his Cadillac when driving drunk

Life lost: Turner was driving her 1996 Ford Explorer and blew through a red light and crashed into Mr Cambra's Cadillac, throwing him from his vehicle

Peter's son, Peter Cambra Jnr told Turner in court that she 'took away someone who was not only a father, but just everything'

Shamed Turner told him: ‘I can't imagine what I've done to your family.’

Speaking
 after the hearing from his home in Rhode Island, Peter's brother Joey, 
48, said: ‘We were a very close family, but this destroyed us. Everyone 
just disconnected.

‘I'm not angry, but I'm hurt we lost my brother. She should never have left the country.’

Peter's
 sister Anne Marie Bernier said: ‘My heart shatters to say that my 
brother has lost his life to a drunk driver. The impact this tragedy has
 had on my family is beyond any words I can say.’

At
 the hearing in Broward County, southern Florida Turner was given a 
six-year jail term followed by nine years' probation, to be served in 
the US.

Peter's relatives returned to the scene of the crash on Thursday to light candles.
