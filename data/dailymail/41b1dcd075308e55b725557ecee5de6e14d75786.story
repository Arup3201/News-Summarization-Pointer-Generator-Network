A station worker was injured when the body of a man who jumped into the path of an oncoming train flew back off the track and hit him.

The guard suffered leg injuries after Shanthan Sritharan, 27, from Walthamstow, east London, died at Surbiton station in Surrey.

Mr Sritharan was pronounced dead at the scene after being hit by the Portsmouth Harbour to London Waterloo train.

A London Ambulance Service spokesman told the Kingston Guardian that paramedics also treated a second patient for minor leg injuries and took him to Kingston Hospital.

A witness from the scene, who did not wish to be named, said: 'There were young children that have seen it.

'To be quite honest with you when people first came out there were a number of them visibly upset.

'There were a lot of people crying.'

The guard was one of nearly 2,000 South West Train staff who are specially trained to identify and approach people contemplating suicide, reported the Daily Star Sunday.

The workers receive training in dealing with suicides as part of an initiative between the Samaritans and Network Rail.

The incident happened at a crowded platform at about 3.30pm on March 19.

Last year the number of suicides on Britain's rail network rose by 13.5 percent to 236 deaths, up from 204.

A South West Trains spokesperson said: 'We are committed to trying to reduce the number of suicides across our network and have launched a five-year partnership with the Samaritans which aims to reduce the number of suicides on the railways by 20 percent by 2015.

'We recognise the impact that any fatality can have on our drivers and front-line staff and we will continue to provide any support we can for them.'
