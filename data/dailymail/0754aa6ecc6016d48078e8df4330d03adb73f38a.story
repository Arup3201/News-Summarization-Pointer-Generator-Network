Treasure chests, battle ships and transformers. You might be fooled into thinking that this is the contents of a toy box - but these are, in fact, the cake creations of Mike McCarey.

Mike McCarey from Redmond, Washington, spends hours in the kitchen sculpting his amazing creations - including the world-famous Macy's store - made entirely from edible ingredients.

The father-of-one set up his own bakery, Mike's Amazing Cakes, in 1993 and has been sculpting his stunning cakes there ever since.

Attention to detail: Mike creates incredible cake creations with purely edible ingredients

For the inventive baker no design is too big, with the majority of his creations being directed by customer's often bizarre requests.

'Designs come from a variety of places, but are mostly guided by the individual client's desires,' says the baker.

'The concept being presented should be as accurate and true to life or as animated as possible and should have as unique a perspective as can be conjured up.'

Mike's attention to detail is astonishing: his ship cake features minature cannons meticulously created from icing, while his sugar hummingbirds appear to hover beside their flowers.

Mike says that his work is heavily influenced by architecture, pictured here is an edible version of New York's famous department store - Macy's

Mike's creations are influenced by artists and illustrators such as Alphonse Mucha, Norman Rockwell and James Christensen

The baker says that his eye for detail and accurate depictions have come from a fascination with building design and intricate drawings.

'My work is constantly influenced by the structural principals of architecture.

'I like to draw inspiration from a wide range of illustrators such as Alphonse Mucha, Norman Rockwell and James Christensen.'

Mike makes his work look effortless but the cake designer says that he has come across some near impossible challenges.

Mike says that his clients often have a a very clear idea of what they want and their requests are very specific

The most difficult cake he attempted was a replica of the Grand California Hotel in Disney Land that he made for the Disney company.

'The thing that made this cake so difficult was the arches and the angles of the arches.

'It
 was definitely a feat to have accomplished such great architecture on 
the cake and capture it in the form of all edible ingredients.'

Mike's efforts have clearly paid off with his client base stretching from the corporate such as Microsoft and Starbucks to Hollywood A-listers including Dustin Hoffman.

He says that his reputation has lead him out of the kitchen and onto exciting new experiences across America.

'I've travelled across the US and around the world to share my experiences and to teach classes or judge cake competitions.'

For Mike, despite his many accolades, the job is most rewarding when he has a happy customer.

'Reactions can vary but the best reaction is when someone can't stop smiling.'
