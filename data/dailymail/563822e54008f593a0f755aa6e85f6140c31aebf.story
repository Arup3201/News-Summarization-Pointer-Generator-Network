The fake island will take two years to build, with the entire project set to finish in 2016.

‘This project will continue to build on the emirate's reputation as a leader in the global entertainment and retail landscape.’

The first phase of construction will include the island itself, the Dubai Eye and entertainment and retail zones, with low-rise residential buildings set to be added by 2016.
