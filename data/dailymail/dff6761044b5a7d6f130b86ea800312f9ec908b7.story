The family of a Tennessee nursing student missing since 2011 has offered yet another reward in the case: $250,000 to anyone with information that leads to the arrest of their daughter's abductors.

The mother of Holly Bobo, who was last seen two Aprils ago being led into the woods by a man wearing hunter's camouflage, made a public plea last week for help finally bring her beloved daughter home.

'My name is Karen Bobo and I need your help to find my daughter,' read the plea.

Stolen beauty: Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo was abducted from her home in Darden in April 2011 and has not been seen since

Another reward: Bobo's family released this new reward poster, timed with the holiday season, with pictures of their beloved daughter trimmed in her namesake festive plant, holly

Holly Bobo was last seen April 13, 2011, when her brother said he saw a man leading the then 20-year-old away from the family home outside Parsons, about 125 miles northeast of Memphis.

Holly was on her way to school in Parsons when she disappeared.

Her brother Clint Bobo said he initially thought she was being taken into the woods by her boyfriend, but became alarmed when he saw the man's arm holding onto his sister and called 911.

Still hopeful: 'During this holiday season as families gather to enjoy being together,' writes Karen Bobo (left), 'our family struggles trying to get word out about Holly and bring awareness to her abduction'

John Mehr, spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said in 2011 that officials believe Bobo followed her abductor into the woods without showing resistance because she was 'in fear of her life.'

According to the Tennessean, there had been a standing government reward in the case of $85,000 as well as a private reward.

According to the poster released by the family, all other rewards have been cancelled as of December 11.

Tragic loss: Holly, whose 23rd birthday came and went in October, was last seen in April 2011 being led away from her home by a man in hunting camouflage. Her brother, who saw the abduction, believed at the time she was with her boyfriend

30 months: Holly was led into the woods near her family home in Darden, Tennessee just as she was headed to class in Parsons. She has not been seen since

Karen Bobo continued:

'During this holiday season as families gather to enjoy being together, our family struggles trying to get word out about Holly and bring awareness to her abduction.

'The greatest gift we could ever receive would be that one clue that brings her home…'

'Each and every day is a struggle but we will keep working and doing all we can to bring her home,' writes Karen Bobo. 'Will you help us?'

Holly's family and the government have previously offered rewards, but to no avail
