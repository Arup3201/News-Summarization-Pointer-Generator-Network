Legendary Chicago Cubs player Ernie Banks may not have his ashes scattered at the team's Wrigley Field playing ground after a legal challenge by his estranged wife.

Banks, who died in January aged 83, had famously said he wanted to be cremated and have his remains thrown to the wind at the baseball field where he made his legacy.

But his wife, Elizabeth Banks, has now taken the executor of his will to court in a bid to stop his body being cremated.

Claims: Regina Rice, right with Banks in 2012, has been stopped from cremating him by the court wrangle

Service: Banks died in January and had a funeral service and public visitation, above, in Chicago at the end of the month

Regina Rice, Banks's close friend and caretaker, was trying to secure the cremation, attorneys for Banks said.

Rice has produced a signed will from last October in support of her claim, along with documents claiming Banks was trying to divorce his wife.

The document makes no mention of plans for what to do with his remains, though Banks had mentioned the Wrigley Fields plan in previous interviews.

However, if Elizabeth Banks's challenge is successful and the body is not cremated, there would be no prospect of wish being fulfilled.

Her lawyers said: '[Elizabeth Banks] is without recourse and shall suffer irreparable damage should Regina's desires to cremate the remains of the decedent be granted.'

It is not clear where Banks's remains have been since his funeral on January 31.

Describing his plans for after death in a local newspaper interview years ago, Banks said he wanted 'my ashes spread out over Wrigley Field — with the wind blowing out.'

The dispute over his body is part of a larger legal battle over his estate, currently being played out in the courts. 

Included in a of documents from Rice are claims Banks was attempting to end his marriage to Elizabeth Banks, his fourth wife.

The documents include a petition for divorce, signed by Banks, seeking to end his marriage because 'irreconcilable differences have caused irretrievable breakdown of the marriage'.

It adds that Elizabeth Banks 'committed extreme and repeated acts of mental cruelty upon petitioner [Banks].'

A document titled 'Last Will and Testament' and signed by Banks on Oct. 17 of last year says he was 'in the process of finalizing  divorce' from his wife and that he had appointed Rice as the executor of his will.

Lawyers for Banks have called the validity of the will into question, saying it was 'allegedly signed' by Banks. 

The Cubs declined to comment on the dispute. Rice did not answer her phone and her attorney did not return calls for comment.
