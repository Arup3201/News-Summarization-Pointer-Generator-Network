Shamed: Rolf Harris, pictured arriving for his sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court, was reportedly fast-tracked to a softer prison instead being held at Wandsworth

Disgraced Rolf Harris was reportedly fast-tracked to a 'soft' prison in Oxfordshire, and did not spend a single night in tougher Wandsworth amid suggestions he was given preferential treatment.

It had been expected that the shamed entertainer would go to tough Wandsworth Prison in south west London after he was sentenced to five years and nine months behind bars for a string of sex attacks.

However, the 84-year-old was taken straight to the softer HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults - prompting speculation he had been given special treatment.

Harris's prison sentence has already raised eyebrows. He could be out in less than three years, and  following complaints from the public, the new Attorney General Jeremy Wright will 
investigate whether it is too lenient.

At the time of his sentencing, it was believed that Harris was taken to a healthcare unit in London’s Wandsworth 
prison – where fellow convicted paedophile Max Clifford also had a cell 
after he was jailed for eight years in May for indecent assault.

He had been expected to spend several weeks at Wandsworth for assessment, before potentially being moved elsewhere.

However, it has now been claimed that Harris did not spend a single night in the category B prison and was instead taken to Bullingdon, a category B/C prison near Bicester, which is known for its work with older prisoners.

A source told The People newspaper that Harris starting his jail stretch at Bullingdon was unusual, as prisoners were usually moved their later on in their sentences as a reward for good behaviour.

'If you're convicted of a serious crime at Southwark Crown Court, you'd always get sent to Wandsworth, no questions asked,' the source said.

'There
 should be no special treatment on grounds of age and there is a 
hospital at Wandsworth so even prisoners in poor health can be treated 
there.'

Currently around 
1,000 prisoners are held at Bullingdon, which opened in 1995, compared 
with the 1,900 at Wandsworth, which was built during the Victorian era 
and once held inmates including Charles Bronson, Great Train Robber 
Ronnie Biggs, and Ronnie Kray.

It
 is also where former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne started his sentence 
for perverting the course of justice, having been sent there from 
Soutwark Crown Court, before he was moved to HMP Leyhill in 
Gloucestershire.

The 
source suggested Harris was sent to the smaller institution to make it 
easier for guards to observe him, and potentially prevent attacks from 
other inmates.

Another source told The Sunday Mirror that Harris is sharing a cell at Bullingdon with another pensioner inmate, and has been very withdrawn.

'He 
is doing all right but spends hours drawing. It takes his mind off 
things,' the source said.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline that the department does not comment on the whereabouts of individual prisoners, and could not comment on where prisoners are usually sent after they have been sentenced at Southwark Crown Court.

Harris was sentenced earlier this month, after travelling part of the way to Southwark from his home in Bray, Berkshire by boat  - where he was seen kissing and joking with friends.

He showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney said the 
shamed star was a committed sex offender who had taken advantage of his 
celebrity status to assault four women aged between eight and 19 in 
plain sight between 1969 and 1986.

Through victim impact statements, the court was told that his
 daughter Bindi’s best friend – abused by him from the age of 13 – said 
he made her feel ‘dirty, grubby and disgusting’, while another
 woman said Harris stole her innocence at the age of eight.

'You took advantage of the trust placed in you because of your celebrity status to commit the offences,' the judge told Harris.

'You clearly got a thrill from committing the offences whilst others were present or nearby.

‘You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all.

'Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame  but yourself.’

It alleged that Harris had not revealed a collection of child 
pornography on his home computer showing children under the age of 13 
naked from the waist down posing suggestively beside teddy bears.

He
 was charged with making indecent images but prosecutors 
dropped the charges for fear of being seen as ‘oppressive’ to the sexual
 predator who was said to be living on borrowed time.

Harris was 
convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault after an eight-week
 trial that heard how he hid the dark side of his Jekyll and Hyde 
personality.

He carefully concealed the ‘demon lurking beneath his charming exterior’ as he used his fame to beguile innocent young fans.

Since his conviction, a number of other women have come forward in Australia and New Zealand and claimed he molested them.

Singer Linda Nolan, 55, and television presenter Vanessa Feltz, 52, have also claimed they were assaulted by the disgraced star.

Feltz said Harris put his hands up her dress during a live broadcast of The Big Breakfast in 1996, while Nolan alleged Harris attacked her when she was a 15-year-old during a tour of South Africa.
