New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was ambushed by angry constituents during a visit to one storm  storm-ravaged neighborhood of the city on Saturday.

'When are we going to get some f****** help?' one woman demanded of the billionaire mayor.

After six days without power, some New Yorkers are losing their patience with the response from the city.

Furious: Residents of the storm-ravaged Rockaways in Queens, New York, confronted Mayor Michael Bloomberg

The mayor's surprise visit to the Rockaway, Queens, which was flooded out by the storm and then decimated by horrific fires, was greeted by angry residents who said they were only now beginning to receive aid.

'There’s old ladies in my building that don’t got nothing,' one furious man told Bloomberg.

The exchange, which left the mayor at a loss for explanations, was captured by a NY 1 TV crew who happened to be in the neighborhood at the same time.

'Mr Bloomberg, this is the first drop off site,' the man said. 'Over the bridge we can't get a bottle of water, a hot chocolate, a coffee, nothing.'

'You know, we're trying to do it as fast as we can,' Bloomberg replied.

Bloomberg, meanwhile, told a local TV interviewer that he had fought to keep the marathon going but the controversy had become ‘so divisive’ and too much of a distraction.

‘I still think that we had the resources to do both, and that we want people to be able to take a break and that sort of thing. ... It's a big part of our economy,’ Bloomberg told WCBS-TV on Saturday during a visit to the borough of Queens.

When asked what he would say to all the runners who had flown in for the event, he said: 'I’m sorry. I fought the battle, and sometimes things don’t work out.'

Should the New York marathon go ahead, despite thousands still suffering black-outs?

As he spoke, he was met by catcalls from residents angry about the city's response to the storm.

Friday afternoon’s last minute decision to cancel the New York marathon was taken amid growing concerns for runner safety and fears they would face abuse from angry New Yorkers.

Speaking at a press conference in the wake of Friday’s decision, Mary Wittenberg, the CEO of the New York Road Runners, said she had sensed a growing ‘animosity toward the runners’ in the days leading up to the proposed event.

‘We became concerned that... no runner - the best in the world or somebody hoping to finish - was going to receive the welcome that we thought they'd receive,’ Wittenberg said.

Many runners have been understanding about the decision to call off the marathon and have sought to get involved in the relief effort. Newark Mayor Cory Booker tweeted Saturday afternoon that he had received a call from 40 runners from Amsterdam who wanted to volunteer.

Sunday's marathon was canceled late Friday afternoon after mounting criticism over Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s decision to go forward with the race.

In the morning Bloomberg had reiterated that the race would go ahead, he called the marathon an ‘integral part of New York City's life for 40 years.’

However by late afternoon he was facing growing criticism that the timing of the race was inappropriate and resources could be better focused on helping the victims of Superstorm Sandy, the decision was taken to cancel the marathon.

‘He is clueless without a paddle to the reality of what everyone else is dealing with,’ fumed Joan Wacks, whose waterfront condo in Staten Island was under four feet of water. ‘He's supposed to be the mayor of all the city, but he's really the mayor of Manhattan.’

Melanie Bright, who went three days without electricity and hot water, said the mayor didn't get it. ‘He feels like we should carry on with our lives, even though people have lost everything,’ she said.

More than 30,000 people signed an online petition saying that they didn’t want the race going ahead.

Ultimately, Bloomberg canceled the event.

‘We cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event - even one as meaningful as this - to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm.’

The decision quickly drew praise from some of the same officials who had slammed the marathon schedule hours earlier. The mayor made a ‘sensitive and prudent decision that will allow the attention of this city to remain focused on its recovery,’ said Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.

But for Eddie Kleydman, motioning toward huge piles of ruined furniture in his Staten Island street, the mayor's last-minute change of heart wasn't enough.

‘He's worried about the marathon. I'm worried about getting power,’ Kleydman said. ‘So he called it off. He has to come here and help us clean.’
