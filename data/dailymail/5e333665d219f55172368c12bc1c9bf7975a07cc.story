A New Jersey teen admitted on Wednesday to luring a high school boy into a relationship with a non-existent girl he created on social networking websites and trying to cash in on the ransom money after he reported to federal authorities that the non-existent girl had been kidnapped.

Andriy Mykhaylivskyy - who also goes by the name Andriy Haddad - pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal authorities when he reported that the girl he created online had been kidnapped overseas. 

Mykhaylivskyy, 19, was arrested in August by officers from the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service and admitted to creating the online identity of Kate Brianna Fulton on social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter, and using the online persona to carry on a year-long, virtual relationship with an 18-year-old, male classmate.

These types of fraudulent, virtual relationships are often refereed to as 'Catfishing' after documentary filmmaker Nev Schulman documented his own online relationship with a woman who, it turned out, had lied to him about her looks and age.

In July of last year, Mykhaylivskyy was visiting the Ukraine when he called the U.S. Embassy in Moldova and - using an alias - reported that his girlfriend, Kate Fulton, was kidnapped in Bulgaria, where she had gone on vacation.

Mykhaylivskyy also told authorities that his bogus girlfriend's mother had received a ransom demand for $50,000.

In addition to lying to federal authorities, Mykhaylivskyy - posing as Fulton - sent electronic messages to his Catfished classmate saying that Fulton had been kidnapped.

In one message Mykhaylivskyy sent the classmate via-Fulton's Twitter account, he said 'someone help me.'

Worried about his online girlfriend, the classmate called the U.S. Embassy in Bulgaria to report that he'd received a message from Fulton, whom he believed to have been kidnapped. 

In pleading guilty, Mykhaylivskyy admitted that he knew Fulton didn't exist and she had not been kidnapped, according to NorthJersey.com.

Additionally, the website reports, Mykhaylivskyy admitted to contacting the classmate while he was in jail and arranging a meeting, which authorities say was obstruction of justice.

Mykhaylivskyy is scheduled to be sentenced on June 25 by U.S. District Judge Claire C. Cecchi. He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
