Chitty Chitty Bang Bang has captured many a child's imagination, but a new all-terrain vehicle that can fly is definitely a toy for grown-ups.

A British engineering firm has unveiled an flying 'car' that is a quick as a Porsche but can also take to the air.

The SkyRunner is being billed as 'part buggy, part aircraft' and claims to be the 'ultimate recreational vehicle'.

A British engineering firm has unveiled the 'SkyRunner' that is a quick as a Porsche but can also take to the air. It is described as 'part buggy, part aircraft' and claims to be the 'ultimate recreational vehicle'

Maximum Road Speed: 115mph

0-60mph: 4.3 secs

Maximum Air Speed: 55mph

Takeoff Speed: 37mph

Cruise Speed: 35mph

Maximum Altitude: 15,000ft

Restricted Altitude: 10,000ft

Range: 200miles

Weight: 420kg

It is powered by a one litre Ford EcoBoost engine that provides 123 brake horsepower and 147lb/ft of torque, which gives the unusual vehicle a 0-60mph time of just 4.3 seconds - the same as a mid-range Porsche 911.

However, the buggy would lag behind in a drag race against the more traditional German sports car, as its top speed of 115mph is considerably slower than the Porsche.

When in the air, the 'car' uses paraglide technology to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft, although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres, which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds

However, the vehicle can take off and fly at 55mph in the air.The SkyRunner goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields, grass strips and secluded beaches.

When in the air, it uses paraglide technology (a large parachute-like wing) to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft, although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres, which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds.

The cockpit of the SkyRunner (pictured) has a sleek computer interface to control the vehicle instead of 'distracting dials, switches and fiddly buttons,' the company said

The car is built from light-weight materials including carbon fibre and weighs 420 kilos.

It uses a propeller to get off the ground and power the craft in the air.

The EcoBoost engine achieves take-off at just 37mph.

Lift is provided by the large relex paraglider wing, which works in the same way as a conventional paragliding chute.

Once in the air, the paraglider wing absorbs turbulence to keep the 'car' stable to 'provide a safe and comfortable flight'.

In the unlikely event of an engine failure, the SkyRunner floats to the ground using its paraglider, or can also rely on a ballistic reserve chute if there is a problem with the wing.

Engineers claim the SkyRunner is capable 
of 53 miles-per-gallon on land which gives it a 500 mile range but this 
is slashed to 200 nautical miles in the air.

The vehicle was designed by a company based in Semley in Dorset called Gilo Industries and can be flown by anyone with a driving license after they complete 12 hours of flight with a certified flight instructor.

Stewart Hamel, SkyRunner's founder and CEO, said: 'This vehicle will change the way people experience their world and provide pure enjoyment of flight.

'Imagine driving an all-terrain vehicle that can convert from road to air mode in three minutes - with SkyRunner, that dream has become a reality.'

The new machine will make its global debut at this week's Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show in Florida, USA.

It is expected to cost around £75,000 with deliveries beginning next year.
