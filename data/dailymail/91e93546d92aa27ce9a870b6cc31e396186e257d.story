Jeffrey Daday, 35, has been sentenced to six months in jail for stealing more than $90,000 from parking meters while on the job

A New York parking inspector who stole more than $90,000 from meters has been sentenced to  six months in jail and five years probation.

Jeffrey Daday, 36, formerly the officer for Mount Kisco, looted the money over a five-year period between January 2009 and May 2014.

He was caught in a sting operation emptying parking machines around town before depositing some of the coins into his own account at a local bank.

Suspicious workers at the branch alerted police to Daday's ongoing payments.

He was confronted on May 6 2014 after cashing in a hoard of change and subsequently arrested.

Parking meters in the Westchester County area take quarters (25 cent coins), dimes (10 cent coins) and nickels (5 cent coins). 

To amass a total of $90,893.72, Daday would have had to have taken more than 360,000 quarters or 900,000 dimes or 1.81 million nickels.

The amount he stole was roughly enough to pay for eight months parking on the streets.

In September Daday pleaded guilty  in Westchester County Court in White Plains to second-degree grand larceny and first-degree offering of a false instrument for filing.

The Brewster resident did face a 15-year jail term for the offense but this was reduced after he paid back the stolen money.

Daday reportedly had no prior criminal record.
