A grieving father who shot himself twice at the graveside of his dead son has died of his injuries.

Allen Hinchliffe, 52, turned the shotgun on himself three weeks ago while visiting the grave of 20-year-old son Ben, who died in a car crash last year.

Mr Hinchliffe, of Scholes in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, shot and killed Ben’s beloved Springer Spaniel before blasting himself under the armpit and in the stomach.

He suffered internal injuries and kidney 
damage and was in the critical care unit at the Northern General 
Hospital in Sheffield for two weeks.

Mr Hinchliffe had regained consciousness and was recovering, with his family saying he was looking forward to going home.

However, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he died on Monday night with wife of nine months Pamela by his side.

Mother-of-three
 Mrs Hinchliffe, 44, said her husband had not come to terms with the 
loss of Ben, who was killed when his Suzuki 4x4 smashed into a wall in 
New Mill last October.

Grief: Allen Hinchliffe, pictured with wife Pamela, has died in hospital three weeks after he shot himself while visiting the grave of his son Ben

Mr Hinchliffe had visited Ben’s grave in Hade Edge Cemetery just days after an inquest heard his son may have fallen asleep at the wheel.

Mrs Hinchliffe said that although Ben didn’t live with his father they saw each other virtually every day.

'They
 were inseparable,' she said. 'They would do everything together and 
would go out fishing and hunting with the dog they shared, Jake.

'Allen loved his son dearly and never got over the loss of Ben.

'He went up to Ben’s grave with Ben’s shotgun and shot the dog before turning the gun on himself.

'Allen loved his son dearly and never got over the loss of Ben. No one should have to bury a child'

'No-one should have to bury a child. He just wanted all three of them to be together.'

Mrs
 Hinchliffe said she had met her husband, a former roofer and keen 
cricketer, at the Shoulder of Mutton pub in Holmfirth where she worked.

'We had both been married before and weren’t looking to get married again but we just clicked,' she said.

'He proposed and we married a year after meeting. He was a wonderful man and we loved each other to bits.'

The couple married at the Durker Roods Hotel in Meltham last August and Ben was best man.

Mrs Hinchliffe, who has three children of her own - Stephen, 16, Sophie, 14, and Shannon, 11, said her husband suffered internal injuries and needed surgery to remove part of his bowel and intestines.

He also needed dialysis and had a catheter because of kidney damage.

She said: 'He was in a coma and the first time he opened his eyes I cried.

'When he realised he had survived he just wanted to escape the hospital and come home with me.

'He was getting better and was moved on to a ward but then suffered a relapse and had a bleed.

'He had got over that but then went to the renal unit for dialysis and his condition deteriorated.

'I was with him at the end and Shannon, who Allen hoped to adopt, wanted to see him.

'He told me he loved me and knew he was dying.'

Loss: The roadside in New Mill where Ben Hinchliffe's Suzuki 4x4 crashed last October

Mr Hinchliffe, a fast bowler who was hoping to play for Holmfirth this season, also had another son and two daughters from a previous relationship.

Mrs Hinchliffe said she had questions over her husband’s death and had asked for a post-mortem examination. She also said she was waiting to hear whether an inquest would be held.

The inquest into the death of trainee butcher Ben, who lived in Meltham, heard how he was not wearing a seat-belt when his 4x4 left the road.

Coroner Mary Burke stressed the importance of wearing seat-belts during the hearing in April.
