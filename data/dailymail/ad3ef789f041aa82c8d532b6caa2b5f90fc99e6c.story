We're a nation that runs on tea drinking, but what would you sacrifice for a cuppa?

New research has revealed how our love of tea is so great that one fifth (19 per cent) of women would rather go without sex than give up tea.

Over a third (35 per cent) of those polled would go without Facebook, and a quarter would forego alcohol (28 per cent) or chocolate (25 per cent) - all in favour of a good brew.

Tea lovers: Miranda Kerr is a notorious tea lover and even designed her own range of china but would she, like one fifth of women, rather go without sex than give up tea?

We're also a fussy bunch when it comes to making it: 48 per cent of Brits prefer to make a cup of tea themselves, rather than trust someone else to make it because, they say, it just doesn’t taste the same.

Results were even higher amongst the 55-plus age group, with the majority (52 per cent) of respondents saying they prefer to make their own brew.

If you are going to accept an offer of a cuppa, think twice before taking one from a man, as 14 per cent admit to giving someone a brew in a dirty mug.

Men’s slapdash approach might be due to less practice, as the average woman makes five cups of tea a day, versus the four made by the average man. That’s 1,825 cups of tea made by the average woman each year, compared to 1,460 made by men.

We really do love tea! A fifth of women would sacrifice sex for a cup of tea, over a third would go without Facebook, and a quarter would forego alcohol

While we'll use almost any excuse to have a cup of tea, there are rules that every tea-maker must abide by.

Nearly half (48 per cent) of Brits think that leaving used tea bags on the kitchen worktop is the biggest tea-making no-no, although 14 per cent  of people admit to doing so.

Leaving the tea bag in the cup goes against tea making etiquette for almost half (44 per cent) of Brits, and serving tea with the remnants of washing up liquid is, quite rightly, frowned upon by 37 per cent of UK residents. One in ten (10 per cent) cite leaving tea stains from a wet spoon in the sugar bowl as one to avoid. 

Fussy: The survey found that 48 per cent of Brits prefer to make a cup of tea themselves, rather than trust someone else to make it because, they say, it just doesn't taste the same

A spokesperson for Whitworths Sugar, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s really interesting the things that people will give up for a cup of tea - and how picky we are about how it’s made. 

'According to our research, to create the perfect cup of tea you should use freshly boiled water, allowing the loose tea leaves to brew for about three minutes and add your preferred milk after water, with the sugar stirred in last.'
