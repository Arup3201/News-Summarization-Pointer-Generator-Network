On leave: Steubenville High School Superintenent Michael McVey was placed on leave after new charges in relations to the rape of a girl, 16

The superintendent and two other employees at Steubenville High School have been placed on leave after they were charged in relation to the rape of a 16-year-old girl by two high school football players, school officials said.

The Steubenville school board did not address the allegations against the employees and referred all questions to the state attorney general, who is leading the investigation.

The employees were placed on leave at an emergency board meeting on Monday in Ohio and a former superintendent is set to run the district temporarily, the board said in a statement.

In March, promising high school football stars Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found guilty of raping the teenage girl in a series of back to back house parties in 2012.

Mays was sentenced to a minimum of one year in juvenile detention for the two counts on which he was convicted: raped and possession and distribution of pornographic material involving a minor.

Richmond was charged only on the count of rape and sentenced to a minimum of one year. Both face a maximum of detention until the age of 21 and have to register as sex offenders thereafter – a punishment against which Richmond has since appealed.

The school board said yesterday: 'Our primary focus is on making sure the School District is able to conduct the business of educating our students.'

A grand jury on Monday charged superintendent Mike McVey with felony for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice and three others with lying or failing to report possible child abuse after an investigation prompted by the rape of the West Virginia girl following an alcohol-fuelled party in August 2012.

Football team strength coach Seth Fluharty, volunteer football coach Matthew Belardine and elementary school principal Lynnett Gorman were also charged on Monday.

Belardine was charged with allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business and making a false statement while Fluharty and Gorman were charged with failure to report child abuse.

Trial by social media: The messages over 
Twitter, Instagram and text that were exchanged on the night of the rape
and the following day were central to the case - and to the outrage it 
has caused 
nationwide

All four are due in court on December 6. McVey, Fluharty and Gorman were placed on leave. Belardine is not a school employee.

The
investigation included crimes committed in connection with the case 
against two members of the celebrated Steubenville High School football 
team as well as a separate alleged rape that happened in April 2012, 
four months before the assault that drew nationwide attention over 
demands that prosecutors should have charged more players.

McVey's
charges include felony counts of obstructing justice and tampering with
evidence and a misdemeanor charge alleging he made a false statement in
April 2012. Efforts to contact him on Monday and Tuesday have not been 
answered.

Belardine, 
whose house authorities said was the scene of the underage drinking 
party that preceded the rape last summer, faces several misdemeanor 
charges, including making a false statement and contributing to underage
alcohol consumption.

Charges: Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announces indictments against four additional people in relation to the 2012 rape of a high school student

Defense
attorneys Brian Duncan and Adam Nemann, who previously represented one 
of the football players, said in a statement that the charges against 
Belardine were unsubstantiated and said he will plead not guilty.

Fluharty
was charged with failing to report possible child abuse in August 2012.
Columbus attorney Tom Tyack said he had been contacted to represent 
Fluharty but could not comment.

Gorman
is charged with failing to report possible child abuse in April 2012. 
Her attorney, Stephen LaMatrice, said she will plead not guilty. The 
charge is not connected to the football players' case, LaMatrice said, 
but declined to elaborate.

State
law in Ohio requires a lengthy list of public and private workers - 
including school administrators, teachers and employees - to immediately
report suspected cases of abuse or neglect.

‘If
you're covered, you have to know what the law says and do what it 
says,’ said Hollie Reedy, chief legal counsel for the Ohio School Boards
Association.

Cover-up: Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine answers questions at a news conference where he announced indictments against four additional people in relation to the 2012 rape of a high school student in Steubenville

Ohio Attorney
General Mike DeWine announced the grand jury's creation March 17, the 
day a judge convicted Ma'Lik Richmond and Trent Mays of digitally 
penetrating the girl.

Last 
month, the grand jury also issued indictments against William Rhinaman, 
the Steubenville schools' technology director, who is accused of 
tampering with evidence and obstructing justice, and his daughter, who 
was indicted for theft unrelated to the rape case.

Ohio
Attorney General Mike DeWine had made clear his intention to root out 
all guilty parties in the ongoing investigation into the case that 
shocked America when it came to trial in March. Then promising high 
school football stars Trent Mays, 17 and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found
guilty of raping a 16-year-old in a series of back to back house 
parties.

Images of the girl, catastrophically drunk, naked, abused and humiliated were posted online.Friends
of the rapist, and their victim, tweeted vile comments and exchanged 
pictures of the girl, strung up between her attackers by her wrists and 
ankles.

Mays was sentenced 
to a minimum of one year in juvenile detention for the two counts on 
which he was convicted: raped and possession and distribution of 
pornographic material involving a minor.

Richmond
was charged only on the count of rape and sentenced to a minimum of one
year. Both face a maximum of detention until the age of 21 and have to 
register as sex offenders thereafter – a punishment against which 
Richmond has since appealed.

The crime continues to divide the blue-collar town on the Virginia River.

With
the victim too drunk to remember the crime texts and pictures taken on 
the night saw the attackers convict themselves with their own words.
