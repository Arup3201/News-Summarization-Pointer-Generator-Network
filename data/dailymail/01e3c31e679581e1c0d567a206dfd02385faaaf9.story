An investigation has revealed that BBC staff are being given up to £90,000 to relocate to the broadcaster's new HQ in Salford.

A Freedom of Information request found that 850 staff have been given a total of £11 million to cover the costs of moving, as well as one-off payouts worth 10 per cent of their salary, to encourage them to move north from London.

Another 1,000 people will move to the £1billion HQ in the future, sending costs spiralling even further, according to the Daily Telegraph.

BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid and Bill Turnbull are among those taking the incentives.

Angie Bray, a Conservative member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: 'I can’t help feeling that Salford is an expensive box- ticking exercise.

'I absolutely understand that the BBC feels the need to demonstrate that they are not entirely London-centric but the fact is the programming from Salford is not as good and it is costing an awful lot of money.'

So far 170 staff have taken advantage
of the 'assisted relocation' package and a further 174 staff have taken
advantage of a 'remote location allowance', where they are allowed to keep their London home and are helped out with rent and travel expenses.

The BBC is also offering to sell staff member's houses at a guaranteed price and licence fee payers then cover moving costs.

Twenty-five members of staff have opted for the scheme, at a cost of £621,000. A further £1.1million has been spent on rent for 188 staff members.

A BBC spokesman said: 'BBC North absolutely represents value for money for License Fee Payers, delivered on time and significantly under budget and being one of the BBC’s most efficient and cost effective centres.

'Since becoming operational in May 2011 BBC North has also begun to make a positive contribution to the regional economy - creating a world-class talent pool and strengthening and supporting the region’s creative industries resulting in programmes made across the North for national audiences.'
