Catty comments: Stella McCartney is struggling to sell her home in Notting Hill, west London

As a renowned fashion designer, Stella McCartney is used to being praised for her sense of style.

When it comes to her judgment in home interiors, however, opinion is rather  more divided.

Photographs of the 41-year-old’s £2.5million townhouse in West London, put on the internet to try to tempt buyers, have met with some catty comments.

The minimalist white decor and simple wooden floors came under fire, with one critic calling it ‘one of the blandest fashion designer-owned pads I’ve ever seen. She couldn’t even throw a staged red couch in there or something to give it some life?’

Another sneered that Miss McCartney’s style was ‘blah and bland’.

But others sprang to her defence, writing: ‘How can you judge her on an empty house?’

The property’s online profile does display one indication of offbeat design sense that should appease the critics, though: one image shows Miss McCartney has placed a bath tub in what looks more like a living area than a bathroom.

The house is on the market for £2.5 million after Stella McCartney lowered her asking price by £400,000

Miss McCartney has been struggling for 
some time to sell the Regency property, and has been forced to lower her
asking price by £400,000 from £2.9million to £2.5million.

But the daughter of Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney may yet have the last laugh on her critics, as the house is under offer.

The drop in value is unlikely to 
trouble the designer, whose company – acclaimed for its work on Team 
GB’s Olympic kit – has just announced record profits of £3.34million.

Notting Hill was made famous in the film of the same name. The main character, played by Hugh Grant, worked in the Travel Bookshop (pictured)

And she will still make an impressive 
return on the three-bedroom house which she bought in 1998 at the age of
26, for a mere £695,000.

The designer has since moved to a 
300-acre estate in Worcestershire where she lives with her husband, the 
publisher Alasdhair Willis, their sons Miller, seven, and Beckett, four,
and daughters Bailey, five, and Reiley, almost two.

A spokesman for estate agent Bective Leslie Marsh refused to comment on the prospective sale.
