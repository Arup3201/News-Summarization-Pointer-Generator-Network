It was not just Ivan Lendl who would have loved this performance from Andy Murray; John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors would have heartily approved too.

Gloriously irascible, the 27 year-old Scot mentally and technically outmuscled Tomas Berdych in what became something of a grudge match to reach his fourth Australian Open final at the Rod Laver Arena on Thursday.

After a shaky start Murray played superbly – as well as he has done since winning Wimbledon – to advance 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 in three hours and 26 minutes.

There was little love lost in a contest which was transformed after Berdych said something at the changeover following the first set that clearly riled Murray. It had been boiling up before then, and even the normally demure Kim Sears became unusually animated, caught uttering the odd oath in the supporters' box.

Murray admitted afterwards that there was an unusual edge to it all, given that he was in opposition to his ex-coach Dani Vallverdu for the first time. He drew on that, as was obvious when he broke back in the first set and directed his celebration towards his opponent's box. It might have been habit, but probably not.

'There was a little bit of extra tension, it was a big match,' said Murray. 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We have been friends since we were 15 years old. I thought it was a bit unfair to create a bit of extra tension out of it but it was there. Everyone calmed down after a bit.'

Berdych later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to annoy Murray.

'I really remember it well. I say to myself "well done Tomas". That’s it. I think I’m allowed to do that when I win a set. What, I have to be worried about every word I am going to say? I just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair. Maybe next time I should stay even more calm, and that’s it. It was a great battle a good match, unfortunately with a bad end for me.'

Murray, the 27 year-old Scot, also wanted to prove a point about his hiring of Amelie Mauresmo, saying: 'A lot of people criticised me working with her and I think so far this week we've shown that women can be very good coaches as well. 

'Madison Keys who reached the semis here and had her best tournament is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward like that in the future. 

'I'm very thankful for Amelie for doing it. It was a brave choice from her to do it and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.' 

Murray fought back in the second set - beating Berdych to love in a stunning half hour of tennis

The No 6 seed added: 'I was obviously disappointed to lose the first set. I had a couple of chances at the end and break points at 5-5. I felt like I started to play better as the set went on and tried to stick to my game and was then very aggressive at the start of the second set.

'I changed tactics a little bit but also I was getting more comfortable with the conditions and the heavy ball that Tomas hits. In the second set I made him do most of the running. I started dictating the points, getting the first strike in. After losing a tough set like the first it as important to get the momentum back.'

The reward is a fiendishly tough final, against either the world No 1 Novak Djokovic or defending champion Stan Wawrinka, who face off on Friday. Murray will have an extra day to recover, although historically that has never been a huge advantage here.

On whether he would be watching their semi-final, Murray said: 'I will definitely watch a little bit but judging by their matches in the last couple of years here I might be in bed before they're finished. So far both have been playing fantastic tennis so whoever has got tickets for that is very lucky.'

Less contentiously than the spats, there were also several technical aspects that underpinned one of the more memorable victories of Murray's career.

The Scot's first serve was excellent, particularly the slider he has perfected out to the deuce court. His movement was superb, and he frequently outmaneuvered the 6ft 5in Czech around the baseline.

A tendency of Berdych has been to serve in a predictable fashion, and when he tried to push Murray wide with the serve the British No 1 was more agile to respond, and he began to read it perfectly from the second set onwards. 

Berdych, the perennial nearly man, could not adjust his thinking as much as the master tactician Murray, who is now in his eighth grand slam final.
