The singer also posted a supportive message to embattled stars Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson

She recently caused a stir when she unveiled her new perfume ad, starring herself, naked, with only 'tiny men' crawling over her to protect her modesty.

But it appears Lady Gaga hasn't tired of baring flesh for her fans.

The 26-year-old tweeted a snap of herself apparently fully naked, sitting in an armchair, hugging her legs to her chest.

Baring all? Lady Gaga tweeted this extremely revealing picture of herself sitting in an armchair

Despite her penchant for stepping out in little more than underwear (embellished with a variety of eye-catching accessories, naturally), this is potentially the most skin Gaga has ever shown in public.

At the risk of looking too closely, Gaga appears to be wearing a deceptively flesh-coloured thong.

She seems to be wearing almost no make-up in the picture, wearing her long blonde hair loose.

The singer has also found time to show her support for embattled stars Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson.

Hardly a break from the norm: Gaga has made a habit of performing in little more than underwear

The couple have dominated headlines since news emerged that Kirsten cheated on her Twilight co-star with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders, 41.

Gaga tweeted: 'geez this kirstew rob stuff is brutal. makes me sad the way press acts. hope they're ok'.

Meanwhile Gaga is continuing on her quest for world domination by landing her silver screen debut role.

The Telephone singer has been cast in Machete Kills, the sequel to Robert Rodriquez film Machete.

In the first picture of her embodying the role of La Chamele√≥n, Gaga can be seen holding a pistol still steaming with smoke, as she seductively poses with a dead white wolf draped around her.

With a shadow cast across her face, the Grammy-winner strikes a pose while dripping with jewels and smouldering in suspenders and Marilyn Monroe-inspired hairstyling.

The excited 26-year-old tweeted: 'Yes its true, I will be making my debut as an actress ln the amazing MACHETE KILLS BY @RODRIGUEZ IM (sic) SO EXCITED!!! AH! Filming was insane.'

She delivered her message after the 44-year-old filmmaker broke the news: 'I just finished working with @LadyGaga on @MacheteKills , she kicked SO MUCH ASS! Holy Smokes. Blown away!'
