Demolition workers dismantling the Costa Concordia cruise liner have found the body of an Indian waiter who was the last missing victim of the shipwreck.

Russel Rebello, who was working on the ship when it hit rocks and sank off the Tuscan coast in January 2012, had been the only person missing after the disaster whose body had not been found.

Carabinieri commander Captain Massimo Pittaluga told the Associated Press the body was discovered by workers clearing debris from the ship in a passenger's cabin on the eighth deck.

Last victim: Russel Rebello was working on the Costa Concordia when it hit rocks and sank off Tuscany

He said the victim was wearing a shirt that contained an identification card for missing crew member Russel Rebello.

A Coast Guard spokesman in the northern port city of Genoa, where the 957ft-long (290m-long) hulk was towed for scrap in July, told Reuters a body found on the ship was 'assumed to be the last victim, Russel Rebello.'

In a Facebook message, Mr Rebello's brother Kevin Rebello confirmed the discovery of his brother's remains, thanking 'all those who prayed and believed that one day he would be found.'

He said a DNA test would be performed before putting his brother to rest 'with honour,' adding simply: 'India, we are coming.'

In August, authorities announced they had found remains on the ship and would test them to see if they belonged to Rebello.

Italian media later reported that those remains were determined to be lamb bones.

Disaster: The Concordia's captain is being tried for manslaughter, causing the shipwreck and abandoning ship

The Concordia, a floating hotel as long as three football pitches laid end-to-end, capsized after hitting rocks near a Tuscan island in January 2012, killing 32 people.

The sinking prompted a chaotic night-time evacuation and one of the largest maritime salvage operations in history.

The ship's captain is being tried for manslaughter, causing the shipwreck and abandoning the ship.
