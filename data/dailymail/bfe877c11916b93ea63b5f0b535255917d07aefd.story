She was seen leading the cortege at his funeral earlier this year, and now the former fiancée of tycoon Scot Young appears to have returned to the public eye.

Noelle Reno, 31, was spotted out and about for the first time since her tragic ex-partner was laid to rest in January, and appeared to be ready to rebuild her life.

The reality TV star and fashion designed attended the UK premiere party for E!'s new show The Royals in London, with a smile on her face once more.

Smiling again: Noelle Reno, 31, was spotted out and about for the first time since her ex Scot Young's funeral

The 31-year-old American looked stunning in metallic shorts and a white vest as she beamed at photographers at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park on Tuesday evening.

Miss Reno, star of Bravo's Ladies of London, suffered a shocking loss when her ex-fiance was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Marylebone, central London, in the early evening of December 8 last year.

Mr Young, a one-time fixer to the super rich, had been one of Britain's wealthiest men, with a series of multi-million pound properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, and a collection of supercars and a private jet.

But he then became embroiled in one of the most high profile and nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with ex-wife Michelle accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters.

Mr Young claimed he had lost all his money in a mysterious Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth 'a few billion'. 

Mr Young, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to give her a settlement of £20million and £6million in legal costs.

He was also sent to prison for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth during the case.

After his release, Mr Young became engaged to US fashion designer and TV presenter Miss Reno. But apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, he spiralled out of control and she split up with him a few months ago. However it is understood he went to Miss Reno's apartment in Marylebone.

When she arrived later that day, she found him inside apparently 'manic, crazy and probably high' and she demanded he leave, friends said.

She allegedly walked out eventually and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her to threaten he was going to jump out of the window.

By the time police arrived, he was dead, impaled on the metal railings outside. Miss Reno said she was 'distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend' and wanted to 'grieve in peace'.

Mr Young had previously spoken of his battle with bipolar disorder, for which he was taking prescription medication.
