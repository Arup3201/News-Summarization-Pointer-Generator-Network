The U.S. government shut down nearly all services this morning after Congress failed to strike a deal to fund public spending before the deadline expired at midnight.

Barack Obama has been locked in battle with the Republicans, who insisted that they would not pass a bill to fund the government unless Democrats agreed to delay the President's signature healthcare reforms by a year.

The White House ordered non-essential services to stop operating shortly before midnight local time (5am BST), the first shutdown for more than 17 years.

Empty: The federal government will be forced to furlough between 800,000 and a million workers, leaving the halls of Washington much emptier in the coming days (including the Capitol Rotunda, pictured)

Prime Minister David Cameron said the situation should serve as a warning to Britain.

'It is a reminder to all of us that we need to have properly planned public expenditure systems, properly planned tax, properly planned arrangements for getting our deficit down,” Mr Cameron said at the Conservative conference in Manchester.

'It is a risk to the world economy if the U.S. can’t properly sort out its spending plans.'

The U.S. Senate, which is controlled by 
Democrats, refused to negotiate with the Republican-dominated House of 
Representatives over 'Obamacare', which requires every American to buy 
health insurance or pay a fine.

This
lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers will go 
on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement.

Critical
functions such as air traffic control and military operations will 
continue, while the elderly will still receive Social Security pension 
payments.

Too late: The funding for the federal government ended at midnight on Monday when the 2013 fiscal year came to a close

On guard: Like all other departments of the federal government, the White House will be operating with a smaller staff than usual during the shutdown

What will happen during the shutdown?All non-essential government services will close and their staff put on unpaid leave. More than 80 per cent of staff at bodies such as Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency will be 'furloughed', but courts, the military and veterans' affairs will remain functioning almost as normal. National parks and government-funded museums such as the Smithsonian will be closed. Social Security pension payments and the 'Obamacare' health reforms will not be affected, because they are funded separately.

What happens next?Democrats and Republicans will return to the negotiating table - but since neither side has been willing to compromise so far, it is hard to predict when they will reach an agreement. The White House insists it will not accept any delay to the implementation of Obamacare, the President's main legislative achievement, which tea party Republicans virulently oppose. The last shutdown, in 1996, lasted 21 days - this one could be much shorter, or it could be even longer.

What is the economic effect?The shutdown is predicted to cost the American economy more than $1billion a day, according to Goldman Sachs, thanks to the drop in output caused by federal workers staying at home, and the loss of tourism.

Why should people outside the U.S. care?Visa applications are expected to be delayed because consulate staff will not be paid, while officials currently involved in international trade negotiations will have to break off from talks. Stock markets around the world fell on news of the shutdown. Even more worryingly, the deadlock in Washington makes it less likely that politicians will be able to strike a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling later this month - if the world's biggest economy is forced to default on its debts, the world could be plunged into the worst economic crisis since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

However, 
national parks will be closed to visitors, most federal offices will 
shut, and even the White House will be reduced to a skeleton staff.

The
federal government has shut down a number of times before, most 
recently under Bill Clinton in 1996, but this incident is considered 
more serious because of the hyper-partisan atmosphere of Washington 
today, as well as the forthcoming fight over raising the debt ceiling to
allow the U.S. to borrow more money.

Democrats
claim that the shutdown is entirely the fault of the Republicans for 
refusing to accept the validity of Obamacare despite the President's 
re-election last year, but Republicans say the Democrats failed to 
negotiate with them.

Stock markets fell yesterday on fears that the two sides would fail to reach agreement, and further losses are expected today.

Mr
Obama this morning told members of the military in a video message that
he would work to get Congress to re-open the government as soon as 
possible.

The President
said troops in uniform would remain on duty as usual. He said he had 
signed a law ensuring troops get paid on time.

He
said ongoing operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere would continue and
the U.S. would ensure those in harm's way would have what they need.

As
Congress reached deadlock, Mr Obama said a 'shutdown will have a very 
real economic impact on real people, right away,' with hundreds of 
thousands of federal workers facing enforced absences and veterans' 
centres, national parks, most of Nasa and other government operations 
shuttered.

He laid the 
blame at the feet of House Republicans, whom he accused of seeking to 
tie government funding to ideological demands, 'all to save face after 
making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their 
party'.

House Speaker 
John Boehner responded a short while later on the House floor. 'The 
American people don't want a shutdown and neither do I,' he said. Yet, 
he added, the new health care law 'is having a devastating impact... 
Something has to be done'.

The
stock market dropped on fears that political gridlock between the White
House and a Republican Party influenced by hardcore conservative tea 
party lawmakers would prevail, though analysts suggested significant 
damage to the national economy was unlikely unless a shutdown lasted 
more than a few days.

Faced with a government shutdown whose political implications are far from certain, Obama recorded a video message for U.S. military personnel in which he avoided blaming the GOP, saying only that 'Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility'

The 1995-1996 federal government shutdown lasted a total of 28 days but left few economic scars as GDP growth skyrocketed after the government reopened. Republicans are hoping the public remembers that the result wasn't as apocalyptic as some had feared

A
few minutes before midnight, White House Budget Director Sylvia Burwell
issued a directive to federal agencies to 'execute plans for an orderly
shutdown'.

The State 
Department will continue processing foreign applications for visas, and 
embassies and consulates overseas will continue to provide services to 
American citizens.

Any 
interruption in federal funding would send divided government into 
territory unexplored in nearly two decades. Then, Republicans suffered 
grievous political damage and President Bill Clinton benefited from twin
shutdowns in 1995 and 1996. Now, some Republicans said they feared a 
similar outcome.

If 
nothing else, some Republicans also conceded it was impossible to use 
funding legislation to squeeze concessions from the White House on 
health care. 'We can't win,' said Senator John McCain, the 2008 
Republican presidential candidate.

Tourists in the U.S., whether they are American or not, are likely to be seriously affected by the government shutdown.

National parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite will be closed for as long as the shutdown continues, with anyone staying in campsites or on-site hotels forced to leave within two days.

World-famous attractions such as the Statue of Liberty, Philadelphia's Independence Hall and the Smithsonian Institute will also be closed to visitors until funding is restored.

Even American military cemeteries outside the U.S. will be closed, as their operation is funded by the federal government.

Airports are expected to run as normal, as immigration, security and air traffic control are all considered to be essential services which continue to run no matter what.

Passport offices are supposed to stay open, but some are located within federal buildings which are otherwise closed.

Visa applications could also be affected, but the State Department claims that as consular services are self-funding they will be able to continue.

Spin room: Senator Ted Cruz is one of the top Republicans pushing for Obamacare to be gutted and pressing to make it a condition of funding the government

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said 'Americans don't want a government shutdown and they don't want Obamacare'

On
a long day and night in the Capitol, the Senate torpedoed one 
Republican attempt to tie government financing to changes in the health 
care law, referred to as Obamacare. House Republicans countered with a 
second despite unmistakable signs their unity was fraying - and Senate 
Democrats promptly rejected it, as well.

Defiant
still, House Republicans decided to re-pass their earlier measure and 
simultaneously request negotiations with the Senate on a compromise. 
Some aides conceded the move was largely designed to make sure that the 
formal paperwork was on the Senate's doorstep as the day ended.

Whatever
its intent, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected it. 'That closes
government. They want to close government,' he said of House 
Republicans.

As 
lawmakers squabbled, Mr Obama spoke bluntly about House Republicans. 
'You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job, for doing what 
you're supposed to be doing anyway, or just because there's a law there 
that you don't like,' he said.

Speaking
of the health care law that undergoes a major expansion on Tuesday, he 
said emphatically: 'That funding is already in place. You can't shut it 
down.'

Shares around the world fell today following the U.S. government shutdown, amidst fears that Congress might fail to raise the nation's borrowing limit later this month.

In Britain, the FTSE 100 was down 22 points at 6,440, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 1.5 per cent and the dollar fell to its lowest level since February.

Yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 129 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 15,129.67. The S&P 500 slid or 0.6 percent, to 1,681.55 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 10 points, to 3,771.48.

While investors are clearly worried about the shutdown, which will depress the national economy by keeping government workers away from their desks, the damage is relatively small compared to the chaos which will follow if the debt ceiling is not lifted by mid-October.
