An 'outstanding' inner-city academy is to be investigated over claims non-Muslim staff are being treated unfairly and staff are attempting to introduce Islamic studies to the curriculum.

Non faith-based Park View Academy in the Alum Rock area of Birmingham was the first academy in Britain to be rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted.

It will now be investigated by Department of Education (DfE) officials following a complaint by an employee.

The complaint is believed to include 
claims non-Muslim staff are being treated unfairly at the state school -
 which also manages two other schools in the city.

Park View Academy will be investigated following claims non-Muslim teachers are being treated unfairly and that the school is attempting to teach Islamic studies. It was Britain's first 'outstanding' rated Academy

The unnamed employee also claims the school has been attempting to introduce Islamic studies on to the curriculum, it is believed.

This is not the first time the DfE has received a complaint about the school. In 2013 Ofsted was informed the school ruled female students were not to be taught tennis by male teachers.

Today, the department said they were aware of the concerns surrounding the school and they will take firm action is any breaches of statutory public sector equality duty are found.

The case will no doubt draw comparisons to controversies surrounding Britain's first Muslim free school - the Al-Madinah school in Derby, which will now stop teaching in summer.

The Government was forced to step in after an Ofsted report warned the academy in Derby was in chaos.

The schools inspectorate report 
detailed concerns over quality of teaching and the curriculum at the 
academy, amid claims it was imposing strict Islamic practices such as 
forcing women to wear headscarves.

Schools
 minister Lord Nash said at the time: ‘It would simply not be in the 
interests of parents or pupils at the secondary school to continue to 
fund provision which has failed them in the manner now apparent.’

A source in Whitehall told The Sunday Times the DfE did not want the school to 'become another Al-Madinah'. They added the department were keen to make sure the school was still viewed as one of the best in the country.

Lindsey Clark, Park View's executive head, said faith classes were being organised - but for after school lessons. She said it was a 'safeguarding issue' for children being hit in local madrasahs.

She said a large number of Muslims worked among a mixed workforce at the school.

She did however admit the school's governors ruled female pupils must only be taught my female teachers.

A statement on the school's website read: 'Our intake is multicultural, with the vast majority of our pupils being of the Islamic faith background. Over many years the academy has worked hard to respect and serve its pupils, its parents and the local community with a relentless focus on improving educational standards.

'Staff at Park View share in the passion for excellence and are committed to the success of all the children and families we serve. This commitment includes striving to ensure that all our policies and practices meet all required legislation and statutory guidance at all levels.

Britain's first Muslim free school - the Al-Madinah school in Derby. It will stop teaching this summer to concerns over teaching and the curriculum as well as claims women were being made to wear head scarves

'The misleading and inaccurate representations in the media are an unhelpful distraction from our core purpose which is to enable the pursuit of excellence, recognition of abilities and talent, and the realisation of ambitions for all of our learners.

'In so doing, we aspire to break the link between demographics, deprivation and destiny. In addition we would like to make the following clarifications with respect to the allegations in the media.

'In common with the majority of secondary schools, P.E. at Park View School is taught in single-gender groups and by same-gender teachers. The job role of a teacher of P.E. is often advertised as gender-specific and is exempt under schedule 9 part 1 of the Equality Act 2010. All other subjects are taught by male & female teachers without regard to gender.

'Park View follows the Birmingham Agreed R.E Syllabus in years 7 & 8 and then from year 9, pupils are prepared for the Edexcel GCSE in Religious Education.

'Park View strictly complies with its recruitment policy which is fully compliant with legal requirements and is observant of fairness and meritocracy in process and practice.'

The DfE said: 'We are aware of concerns around this school and are looking into the issues raised. All state schools must comply with the statutory public sector equality duty.

'We will not hesitate to take firm action if breaches of these requirements occur. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'
