No windows and enough room for one person and a few possessions

They are barely large enough for a single person to squeeze into at all, let alone swing a cat.

But incredibly these tiny 'coffin' apartments in central Tokyo still command rents of up to £400 a month.

The Japanese capital is one of the most crowded cities in the world, and to cash in on the chronic housing problem, landlords have developed what are known as 'geki-sema' or share houses.

Pokey: People are paying up to £400-a-month to live in the tiny 'coffin' apartments

Party time: The news team somehow manage to all squeeze inside the miniscule apartment

They are little more than cupboards, tiny cubicles stacked on 
top of each other with just enough room for one person and a few of their possessions.

Definitely not for the claustrophobic, many don't even have windows and the doors and anyone over 6ft tall would have trouble stretching their legs.

Most are used by 
young professionals who spend most of their time at work and outdoors, 
using these tiny accommodations just for sleeping.

Entertaining friends: The apartments tend to be used by young professionals who spend most of their time at work and outdoors

No space like home: Many of the 'geki-sema' share houses don't even have windows
