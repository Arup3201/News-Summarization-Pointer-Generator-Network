A protester was bundled out of the House of Commons today after throwing a bag full of marbles at MPs from the public gallery.

The man stood up, shouted and hurled the objects while David Cameron was responding to questions during Prime Minister's Questions.

The marbles hit a £600,000 glass screen which was installed in 2004 to protect MPs from an anthrax attack.

Today's incident occurred as Mr Cameron was on his feet answering questions from MPs.

Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry tweeted: 'There's a fracas in public gallery #pmqs. Tried to lip read man as he's dragged out. Believe he's shouting 'Answer the b***** questions'.'

Tory MP Mark Pritchard added: 'Man taken hurriedly out of Commons public gallery... Public and Members appear all ok.'

After the incident the  man responsible said : 'That was not a protest. Last week I heard them say it was us and them, the elite and us.'

Jim Murphy, Labour's Shadow International Development Secretary, said there should be a 'thorough inquiry' into how it was allowed to happen.

A House of Commons spokesman said there was 'a disturbance in the public gallery during Prime Minister's Questions today'.

The spokesman said: 'A man was escorted from the gallery by doorkeepers and is currently in Metropolitan Police custody.

'The incident did not disrupt the business of the House and there were no injuries sustained.'

The Metropolitan Police said later that a man had been arrested on suspicion of being equipped to cause criminal damage and of committing an offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act.

In 2004 Tony Blair was struck on the back by a condom filled with purple flour thrown by a Fathers for Justice protester

In 2004, condoms full of purple flour were thrown at Tony Blair as he faced MPs in the House of Commons.

Mr Blair was speaking during Prime Minister's Questions when one of the projectiles hit his back, prompting an evacuation by MPs.

Campaign group Fathers 4 Justice claimed responsibility.

Protester Guy Harrison managed to get into the Commons chamber after getting tickets at a charity auction.

The millionaire businessman had no previous history of militancy or direct action - but claimed his experiences with the family law courts drove him to protest.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'At approximately 12:30hrs on Wednesday, 22 October, police responded to a disturbance in the public gallery of the House of Commons.

'A man was arrested on suspicion of going equipped to cause criminal damage and Section 5 of the Public Order Act.

'Established security procedures worked effectively and parliamentary business continued unaffected. The man is currently in custody at a central London police station.'

But he said nothing should be done which 'jeopardises the public's ability, to come along, to be in the public gallery but importantly meet their members of Parliament in central lobby'.

'I had constituents with me today... touring around in a relatively free way in the Palace of Westminster is a big part and a good part of our democracy.'

One witness, James Smith, 17, said that the gallery fell 'dead silent' after a man in a green coat threw a large bag of marbles over the protective screen.

He told the Telegraph: 'It was over the NHS thing, Cameron said something and this man was obviously not very happy, so he got up and threw the marbles at the window and proceeded to swear and use foul language - very foul language.

'It was dead silent, everyone was in shock - a bit shocked that this man had got up and thrown some marbles. It was immediately obvious it was marbles, a big bag of them and they went everywhere.

'The guys grabbed him and he wouldn't go. He was saying 'I'm an English gentleman, I have the right to say my bit' and then he got carted off. We were just 'wow' - and then carried on watching.'

He added: 'I don't know how he got in because he had a big green coat on so he has obviously hidden it in there. How has he got in with a bag of marbles? I had a full body search, the guy in front of me did, the guy behind me did.'

Members of the public were detained in the public gallery while the man was detained by police officers.

The glass screen was installed in 2004 after the then-Leader of the Commons Peter Hain warned there was a threat to throw anthrax at MPs from the gallery.

Six weeks later the Commons was suspended for 70 minutes after a protester threw an object at Tony Blair from a side gallery, showering the backs of the then Prime Minister with purple powder. The Fathers4Justice group subsequently claimed responsibility.
