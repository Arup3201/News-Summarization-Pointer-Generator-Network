They bossed England at Wembley and finished just four points behind Argentina in qualifying, yet still Chile rank as World Cup outsiders ahead of their opener with Australia.

It is, no doubt, their Group B residence alongside champions Spain and 2010 runners-up Holland – not to mention a probable second-round meeting with Brazil – which sees the South Americans installed as 40/1 shots.

But Chile could yet prove the brightest of all the dark horses at the tournament and a convincing victory against a weak Australia could well see those odds slashed.

Centre of attention: Alexis Sanchez is the star man for Chile... and he has a superb supporting cast

It was back in November that Jorge Sampaoli’s side were 2-0 victors over England as they put on a performance which married style, strength and, admirably, a cunning cynicism.

They have since held Spain to a 2-2 draw and won plaudits following a 1-0 defeat to Germany and the feeling is they boast all of the ingredients to emerge as the sexy second team of World Cup followers.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through the five Chileans who could star over the next four weeks…

Alexis Sanchez (25 years old, 67 caps/22 goals)

He was a 21-year-old wonderkid in South Africa who dazzled with his quick feet and even quicker turn of toe. Four years on he has matured into a goalscoring talisman, evidenced by his 19 La Liga strikes for Barcelona last season and his brace in that win at Wembley. Now deployed in a central role rather than out wide, the pressure will be on Sanchez to add to his 22 international goals over the course of the next fortnight – we’re confident he can shoulder such burden.

Two good: Sanchez scored both goals when Chile beat England at Wembley last November

Arturo Vidal (27 years old, 54 caps/8 goals)

The Juventus schemer is one of the most respected midfielders in European football at present, a player whose game knows no weakness and one who can score goals as well as defend them. Vidal has the potential to emerge as one of the stars of the tournament and will no doubt be the subject of renewed interest from the Premier League and La Liga. He could, however, miss the opener against Australia because of a knee injury.

Eduardo Vargas (24 years old, 30 caps/14 goals)

His European club career is yet to truly ignite following an £11.5million move to Napoli in 2012 – he spent the second half of last season on loan at Valencia – but on the international stage Vargas is right at home. His return of 14 goals from 30 outings speaks for itself and the pacey, skilful frontman could capitalise if opposition defences become preoccupied by comrade Sanchez.

Charles Aranguiz (25 years old, 21 caps/2 goals)

The midfielder is likely to raid the penalty area in search of goals but is equally adept at laying them on for team-mates. Sampaoli knows him well from the Chilean youth ranks and the Udinese man is one of the coach’s most trusted lieutenants.

Felipe Gutierrez (23 years old, 18 caps/1 goal)

The injury to Vidal should see the FC Twente midfielder handed his chance to shine. He is slight of build but laden with skill and has the experience of two years in the Eredivisie. Gutierrez was praised by team-mate Marcelo Diaz this week and there is a feeling he could be the wildcard in Chile’s pack.
