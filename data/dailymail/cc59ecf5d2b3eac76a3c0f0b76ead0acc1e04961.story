The rise of transgender teen Jazz Jennings continues, with the 14-year-old becoming the new face of Clean & Clear in the same week that she landed her own reality TV show.

On Friday it was announced the Florida ninth grader - who was born male and diagnosed with body dysmorphia at age five - is the star of a progressive campaign for the skincare giant called 'See The Real Me'.

The campaign video shows Jennings speakings of the struggles of growing up as 'a girl trapped in a boys body' and how she internalized it, before breaking free and being herself.

'But this year I decided to make a change and  put myself out there and make new friends,' she says in the campaign.

'The real me is happy and proud to be who I am. I'm just happy being one of the girls.'

Jennings explain to Popsugar: 'The brand approached me and told me about the campaign. The See The Real Me campaign is so great at helping girls find the courage to open up to their peers and be themselves, and I could really relate to that. 

'I knew doing this campaign would help a lot of teens who are struggling like I did,' she said.

Every year in the United States, 41 percent of transgender people commit suicide.

Jennings has already written a children's book, I Am Jazz, about a transgender child, and launched a charity, The TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation.

On Thursday TLC confirmed they had signed Jennings for an 11-episode reality series. 

Friends: Jennings says she is 'happy being one of the girls'. She is seen here with her friends

 'Jazz may be known as an author and activist, but she's first and foremost a teenage girl with a big, brave heart, living a remarkable life,' Nancy Daniels, the general manager of TLC, told People.

Marjorie Kaplan, group president of TLC & Animal Planet, added: 'Only TLC can tell this family's story in way that celebrates and demystifies difference in an effort to help create a world without prejudice.'

TLC have not released an air date for the show, which is believed to have already started filming. 

The show will mostly focus on her family. 

Jennings was last year named one of TIME magazines 25 most-influential teenagers, alongside Taliban victim and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Malala Yousafzai.

In a recent interview, Jazz discussed some of the perils of being in high school and being transgender, revealing that some people cruelly refer to her as 'it'.

Jazz said: 'I like some boys in my class at school but no one likes me back.

'It upsets me, I worry it's because I'm not pretty. But my friends tell me I'm attractive.

'My friends started chatting about boys they fancied but Mum warned me not to join in, in case I was teased.
