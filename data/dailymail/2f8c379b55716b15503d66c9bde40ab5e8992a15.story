A former Marine who stole a fire truck while naked and used it to kill a pedestrian has been found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Kalvin Hunt, 28, from South Carolina, was told of the verdict at Beaufort County Courthouse on Thursday before being remanded to a secure state mental health facility.

Three qualified psychiatric forensic psychiatrists had analyzed his behavior linked to the 2012 incident, and ruled at that time he was 'not capable of controlling himself.'

Hunt will now remain in care until he regains his sanity.

If he is ever recommended for release there will have to be a new hearing.

On February 24 2012 Hunt fled naked from a Naval Hospital in Beaufort where he was undergoing a mental evaluation and stole a Port Royal fire truck that was responding to a medical call at a nearby apartment complex.

He then struck and killed 28-year-old Justin Nicholas Miller before crashing into woods.

Along with murder, he was charged with six counts of hit and run with injuries, two counts of resisting, grand larceny and assault and battery in the first degree. 

Following his arrest, he was dishonorably discharged from the Marines.

Prosecutors said Hunt's mother was concerned about his mental state at the time and was trying to get him help from the Veterans Administration. 

Flashback: Hunt joined the Marine in 2003 - Over the years he served at six different military bases and spent about seven months in Iraq earning various good conduct medals

Hunt joined the Marine in 2003. Over the years he served at six different military bases and spent about seven months in Iraq earning various good conduct medals.

However, according to military officials, he was dismissed from the services in April 2011 after a court-martial in which he was found guilty of assault, communicating a threat, resisting arrest, and other charges. 

It was from this point that his behavior appeared to spiral out of control. 

Defense attorney Cory Fleming called it one of the saddest cases he has ever seen. 

'We felt like this is where we were going from the beginning,' Fleming said of the insanity plea. 

'It's heartbreaking, and I hope now Kalvin can get the treatment he needs.'
