Details of thousands of British prisoners of war from the First and Second World Wars are being published online for the first time today.

Family history website Ancestry.co.uk said the records from 1914 to 1945 include camp locations and dates of capture and release.

Thousands of newly-digitised records include names and personal details of famous Spitfire pilots who were captured, such as Sir Douglas Bader, who was imprisoned in the notorious Colditz Castle.

Incredible: Fighter pilot Douglas Bader lost both his legs in a flying accident in 1931 but overcame his disability, rejoined the RAF in 1939, and commanded the RAF Canadian Fighter Squadron during the Battle of Britain

Miriam Silverman of Ancestry.co.uk 
said: 'This collection will allow thousands of people to find out more 
about the war heroes in their own family.

'They serve to highlight some truly amazing tales of escape and cunning from POWs captured across both world wars.'

Sir
Douglas has been credited with 20 aerial victories during the Second 
World War dspite having lost both his legs in a flying accident in 1931.

In 1941, he was shot down and captured in France.

Extreme bravery: A scene from the 1956 film Reach For The Sky which depicts the moment Sir Douglas was shot down over Le Touquet, France, before being captured by German forces in 1941

Fortress: Sir Douglas was sent to the Colditz Castle, a high-security POW camp in Germany where he remained until the end of Second World War. More than 300 soldiers made escape attempts and 30 succeeded in getting back to their home countries

Opening up the past: Thousands of newly-digitised records will also include names and personal details of other famous Spitfire pilots who were captured

German forces treated Bader with 
great respect. He lost his prosthetic leg when he bailed out and the 
Nazis allowed a new one to be dropped in by the British.

From then came his series of escapes. He tried so many the Germans threatened to take away his legs.

Bader escaped from a hospital by tying together a number of sheets but was betrayed by a hospital worker.

In 1942, he escaped with three others
from Stalag Luft III only to be found a few days later.

Tthe Germans 
were so concerned by his attempts they produced a poster describing him 
and how he walked so the public could spot him if he fled again.

Finally, he was sent to Colditz staying there until the end of the war - but he had tried his best to get out before then.

Around 300 escape attempts were made 
from the high-security castle, of which only around 30 successfully made
it back to their home countries.

Ancestry.co.uk says it is giving free access to millions of war records on Remembrance Day.
