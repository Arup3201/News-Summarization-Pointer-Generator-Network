Think of LA and the mind conjures up images of sunshine, sand and palm trees... perhaps the Hollywood sign or Rodeo Drive?

But when the sun goes down the city comes to life in the most beguiling manner.

As the sunlight fades, the lights of a different kind emerge in the gritty streets of the City of Angels.

The bright, vibrant colors of neon signs provide an alluring welcome to even the dingiest of neighborhoods.

From motels to liquor stores, often in the most insalubrious of areas, you can find a slice of Americana.

Enticing: The glow of neon and bright lights of an LA liquor store call Angelenos to park up and step inside

Streets that are normally teeming 
with cars appear deserted with just the glow of traffic lights and the 
electric sign of a nearby store to light the way.

The pictures depict a calmness of LA that is rarely experienced.

One can almost hear the buzzing of 
the neon lights and the flickering of a strobe as they as they provide a
 beacon for some Angeleno to grab a bottle of beer, stay the night or do their laundry.

And even though many of the stores are closed, the luminous, energetic colors remind us all that here is a city bursting full of life.

Glowing: At this liquor store, you're spoilt for lighting... If not for choice!

The photographer Vicky Moon calls her series 'Expired L.A.: an ongoing series of exploration of Los Angeles at night'

Ms. Moon says she looks for run down buildings that hold a forgotten beauty and photographs them with expired, 35-year-old film.

'Every building is unique and captivating, as well as the individual color shifts each building creates with every exposure.'

'I am fascinated by the drama that is 
created by the night sky and seek the beautiful in the over looked; I 
find the mundane to be extravagant and I find the beauty in the expired;
 This is my Los Angeles,' she says.Â 

Lost in translation: At this LA laundry, even Chinese script does not escape the clutches of the neon press...

A touch of class: Impress your friends with a stay at the 'Harvard House' where color TV with questionable entertainment is still a feature!

Ruski red: Life can be lived at this Russian liquor store with lottery, money orders, groceries and beer amongst the items that can be picked up

Now showing: Bold and bright, drinkers would not have a hard time finding a pick-me-up near this store

Open all hours: No signs of life outside this sinister looking 'theater'

In the neighborhood: Renters would find themselves stumbling to and from this charming and conveniently located cocktail bar in the early hours

Signing off: It looks like the only thing that wasn't delivered was the 'Q' in this sign

Lights off: Maintenance standards at the Palace reached such depths, they rebranded to 'Lace'!

Vacancy: A cosy night with so few guests, you'd know them all by dinner

An LA original?  It seems the connecting orbits motif has been around longer than anyone realised

Lighting up: There is a warming constancy to the shop level lightning

Get the message: How many open signs does one shop need?
