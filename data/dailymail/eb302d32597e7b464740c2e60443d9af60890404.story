Out of pocket: Jon Williams, , a nutritionist with the Wales rugby team, ended up paying twice for a villa in order to safeguard his break

The holiday plans of thousands of Britons are in limbo after an upmarket villa firm went bust.

Customers
 of Villa Parade, which managed more than 1,000 properties across the 
Mediterranean and in America, have been scrabbling to get their cash 
back after it went under last month.

It
 is claimed the holiday watchdog, the Association of British Travel 
Agents (Abta), was warned that the company was struggling, but allowed 
them to continue taking bookings until a few weeks ago.

The villa firm is the biggest in the travel industry to go under since 2008.

It
 is understood the firm, run by a husband and wife team, had run up 
debts of more than £6.5million - £3.3million of which was owed to 
holidaymakers.

Brian 
McLaughlin, the retired boss of music and film chain HMV, said he paid a
 £2,500 deposit on a villa in Majorca that he booked for three weeks in 
August.

Although he 
contacted Abta in April after hearing about the firm’s difficulties, he 
claims he was reassured that Villa Parade was trading normally.

‘Abta
 told me that as far as they were concerned Villa Parade was financially
 sound and met their stringent conditions of membership,’ said Mr 
McLaughlin, 64, said.

‘But 
Villa Parade stopped answering the telephone and the final time I went 
on their website the message said they had gone into liquidation. So 
much for Abta and their assurances.’

Jon
 Williams, a nutritionist with the Wales rugby team, ended up paying 
twice for a villa, also on the Spanish island, in order to safeguard his
 break last month.

He 
handed over £2,500 to Villa Parade and the same amount to another travel
 company that took over the defunct company’s bookings.

Mr
 Williams and his family were keen to hire the property, which they had 
visited previously, because they knew it catered for the needs of his 
ten-year-old daughter, who suffers from cerebral palsy.

Mr Williams, 42, from Tredegar, South Wales, said: ‘We had been to the villa three times.

‘It
 has an outdoor jacuzzi which is great for our little girl. I didn’t 
want to risk going to Majorca and finding I was barred from the villa.

‘Once
 I was out there, it was clear Villa Parade was no longer operating and 
its office had closed down. Abta was reluctant to get involved. They 
were absolutely useless. Abta is there to protect its members, not the 
public.’

Travelopo, a rival
 villa rental firm, also said it approached Abta in April to warn them 
that Villa Parade was allegedly not paying the private owners of villas 
and owed them money.

Roger 
Fenton, Travelopo’s managing director, said: ‘Abta knew of the problem 
for at least eight weeks. The Spanish owners came to us in desperation 
because they hadn’t been paid for a year and were owed 2.5 million 
Euros.

‘Not only that, they 
had distressed holidaymakers turning up for accommodation they had 
booked through Villa Parade whose contract had been cancelled.

‘We
 alerted Abta as soon as we realised the scale of the problem - which 
had clearly been brewing for well over a year. Abta should have acted 
faster.’

Travelopo claims to have evidence that some villas had been triple and quadruple booked by Villa Parade before it went bust.

Villa
 Parade claimed that negative postings on travel websites such as 
TripAdvisor wrecked consumer confidence in the company and led to its 
rapid demise.

A spokesman for Abta said it launched an investigation as soon as Travelopo raised concerns on April 9.

‘We
 will be working with the liquidator and other stakeholders to 
investigate the full circumstances of this failure, its causes and in 
relation to the recovery of all assets and losses,’ he said.

He insisted all customers would be reimbursed, either through their credit card companies or through Abta.

Chris
 Brooksbank, the company’s liquidator, admitted it was a ‘messy’ state 
of affairs, but added: ‘In defence of the directors they have been fully
 cooperative.’

Nightmare holiday: Lorraine and Mike Beasant were evicted from their villa during a family break to Mallorca

A
 terminally ill woman was evicted by police from a holiday villa, after 
Villa Parade failed to inform her it had cancelled her booking, writes CAROL DRIVER.

Lorraine
 Beasant was on a family trip to Mallorca – her last before her latest 
round of treatment for cancer – when she was forced to leave the 
five-bedroom property on the first night.

The
 57-year-old, who was on holiday with her husband, Mike, her three 
grown-up children and friends, booked the £1,450-a-week break through 
Villa Parade in 2013.

However,
 the company failed to tell Mrs Beasant she was no longer able to stay 
in the property, only sending her an email the day before her April 12, 
2014, booking, which she did not read.

The
 10 adults arrived at Villa Moncho - chosen because it had a downstairs 
bedroom so Mrs Beasant would not have to carry her medical equipment up 
stairs - gaining entry at about 2pm by using a code given to them by 
Villa Parade.

However, neighbours alerted the Spanish owner, who called the police, who arrived later that evening.

Mrs
 Beasant told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were having a barbecue when the 
owner and the local police turned up at about 9pm. My son came in and 
said “I’m sorry to do this mum, but we’ve got to move out”.

‘It was a shock. It really upset me to be evicted hours after arriving.'

The
 property owner – who did not want to be named - claims he cancelled his
 contract with Villa Parade in November 2013. He said he had no 
knowledge of Mrs Beasant's booking and called the police to help with 
translation.

Villa Parade moved Mrs Beasant and her family to another property, but without a downstairs bedroom.

She
 said: ‘I was ill during that week because I had to deal with the stairs
 all day, and when you’re on oxygen… that was upsetting.'
