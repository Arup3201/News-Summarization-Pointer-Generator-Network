Tottenham are keen to sign West Ham defender Winston Reid – but will not bid for him in this transfer window.

Spurs are understood to be willing to meet Reid’s wage demands of £60,000-a-week wages.

Reid is set to leave West Ham in the summer on a free transfer and has been linked with a number of top Premier League clubs.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been linked with a move for Reid in this transfer window.

And Chelsea have also been sounded out, as have Everton but Reid is believed to have his heart set on a move to a top six club.

The 26-year-old joined West Ham in 2010 from Danish club Midtjylland and has made over 100 appearances for The Hammers.
