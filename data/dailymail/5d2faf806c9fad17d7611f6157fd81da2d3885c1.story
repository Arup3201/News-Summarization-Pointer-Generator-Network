Hilary Alexander OBE, Editor-at-Large at HELLO! Fashion Monthly, who commissioned the poll, comments:

'It's great to see such a high percentage of British women represented within HELLO! Fashion Monthly's new list of the most stylish stars. 

'As a nation, we are really dominating the industry at present, with top designers such as Vivienne Westwood, Burberry, Matthew Williamson, Stella McCartney, Victoria Beckham, Alice Temperley, Jenny Packham, Christopher Kane and Mary Katrantzou excelling on the global stage, so it is fantastic that our style ambassadors are also following suit.

It is also interesting to note that there is a great range of ages represented within the list – emphasising that style doesn't come with an age limit.'
