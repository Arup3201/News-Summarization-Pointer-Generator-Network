A Columbia University student accused of raping a classmate - who has been carrying around her mattress in protest ever since - has insisted he is a feminist.

Speaking to the New York Times in his first ever interview, Paul Nungesser called the rallies against him 'bullying' - and slammed the university for failing to prevent them.

He was accused by fellow senior Emma Sulkowicz of violently raping her in her dorm room more than two years ago, but the university cleared him in the case and in two others.

After learning about the decision, Sulkowicz started lugging around her 50-pound mattress to symbolize the burden she was carrying - and vowed to continue until he left the school.

The protest is also the subject of her senior thesis for the visual arts department - entitled 'Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)' - and has encouraged other students to rally with her.

Nungesser, who insisted the sex was consensual, told the Times he has finally decided to speak out because graduation is just months away. He insisted that he was innocent.

'My mother raised me as a feminist,' he said. 'And I'm someone who would like to think of myself as being supportive of equal rights for women.'

But when Sulkowicz accused him earlier this year of hitting her, pinning her down and raping her in August 2012, two other female students also made complaints against him.

One student claimed he'd groped her during a party while another who said he forced her into non-consensual sex during their relationship. He was also cleared in these cases. 

The campus newspaper, the Columbia Spectator, chose to name Nungesser, saying that his name was available to the public in police reports.

Afterwards, he saw his name plastered across campus bathrooms and in online news articles, he told the New York Times. His friends started avoiding him, he said.

He said some people suggested there had been a misunderstanding between him and Sulkowicz.

'But the matter of the fact is it's not a misunderstanding,' he said. 'What was alleged was the most violent rape, and that did not happen.'

Protest: Sulkowicz's accuser claimed in a New York Times article that he is a feminist

After Sulkowicz's allegations, students have held rallies on campus and in October, students at more than 100 colleges were inspired to carry mattresses to highlight campus sexual assault.

At Columbia, some students hauled their mattresses to one of Nungesser's classes and took photos of him as he entered the room.

Nungesser called the protests bullying and said the university has not prevented them, even though he has been cleared of wrongdoing.

'There is a member of the faculty that is supervising this,' he said, referring to Sulkowicz's thesis. 'This is part of her graduation requirement.' 

Columbia said in a statement that academic freedom allows students to express themselves on issues of public debate.

He said he was only accused by the three women after they heard similar stories from each other.

In the first case, he was given 'disciplinary probation' but he appealed - and by then, the accuser had graduated and did not participate in the process and the decision was thrown out.

The university also dropped the second case after she stopped answering emails about it over the summer vacation, saying she was exhausted by the questioning.

In Sulkowicz's case, the university found there was not enough evidence and when she asked for an appeal, it was denied.

She previously explained that she went to police a year and a half after the incident happened because she was afraid and ashamed of what had happened.

'When it first happened, I didn't want to talk to anyone,' she explained. 'I didn't even tell my parents. ... I didn't even want to talk to my best friend.' 

Sulkowicz stands by her story and as the New York Times published its article on Monday, she shared the piece on her Facebook page, writing: 'My rapist calls himself a feminist.'

Following the case, the university changed the way it handles sexual assault allegations. Both sides are now allowed to bring a lawyer and if they do not have one, Columbia will provide one for them.

Nungesser said he is looking forward to leaving the school. He will graduate the same day as Sulkowicz - who said she might bring her mattress on stage. 

Nungesser said he has spoken to a lawyer but is not pursuing any legal action.
