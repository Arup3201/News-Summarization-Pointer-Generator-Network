When animal welfare workers found two six-month-old pit-bull-cross pups roaming the streets of Philadelphia they quickly realized there was no splitting the two up.

Jermaine acts as a guidedog for his blind brother Jeffrey, patiently leading him and making sure to maintain physical contact with his blind brother.

Their carers were able to snap this sweet picture of the two dogs cuddled up together fast asleep that shows the bond between the litter-mates.

Love is blind: These two brothers have formed a close bond, with Jermaine leading his blind brother Jeffrey and making sure he's always close by

Now eight months old, the dogs are in the care of Operation Ava, a no-kill animal shelter that seeks to find forever homes for abandoned animals.

Believed to be labrador-pit bull mixes, the two are seeking a home, and their carers are keen for them to stay together.

'They're always pretty much touching each other,' Ray Little, director of lifesaving at Operation Ava, told NBC Philadelphia.

'Jeffrey really does try to maintain contact with Jermaine, especially when he's in an unfamiliar environment. As soon as he gets familiar with a new place, then he becomes a little bit more independent. But it's amazing how they try to maintain contact with each other.'

Since the Chester County SPCA posted the picture of the sleeping brothers embracing, it's been shared more than 67,000 times.

The response has been overwhelming, but Little says people who have serious intentions of adopting the dogs need to physically go to the shelter.

'It's always best for potential adopters to meet the dogs. We have only received two applications and we're still waiting to hear from references,' he told NBC Philadelphia.

The pups are described being social and good with children. They're currently about 35lbs but Operation Ava staff estimate they'll eventually grow to about 50lbs each.

Apart from his eye condition, which vets believe to be congenital, Jeffrey and his devoted guide brother Jermaine are completely healthy.

A generous benefactor has paid for Jeffrey's adoption fee, to help ensure the brothers stay together.Â 

Anyone interested in taking in the brothers is encouraged to go to Operation Ava headquarters to meet them and bring along three references.
