Value supermarkets Morrisons and Aldi are taking on high-end stores Waitrose and Marks & Spencer with their luxurious lobster offerings this Christmas.

Traditionally the fanciest of festive foods, lobster is now being sold for the price of a standard turkey joint at stores up and down the UK.

While M&S and Waitrose are charging up to £24 for a fresh dressed lobster Morrisons has introduced a £10 ready-to-eat dressed lobster and Aldi is offering lobster tails for £4.99, while Asda is stocking £5 frozen versions for real buffet-loving bargain hunters.

Morrisons today announce news of their £10 dressed crustacean, which comes topped with prawn mousse

Tesco provide some tasty competition with their Finest dressed tails (300g) at just £10 and Sainsbury's are also selling lobster tails, but their 280g Taste the Difference offering costs £15.

The Morrisons £10 dressed lobster dish comes topped with prawn mousse and the supermarket predicts a 100 per cent rise in year on year sales.

A Morrisons spokesperson said: 'The
 Morrisons Signature Dressed Lobster is not only fantastic in taste, but
 also a quality product at a great price,'

'It's perfect for serving as starter on the Big Day or displaying as a centre piece in the Boxing Day spread.'
