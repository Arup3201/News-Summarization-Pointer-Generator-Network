Looking after a six-year-old can be exhausting, even for those in the prime of their life.

So spare a thought 76-year-old for Omkari Singh - the world's oldest mother - and her schoolboy son Akashvani.

In 2008, Mrs Singh, from Uttar Pradesh, northern India, made headlines around the world after giving birth to twins Akashvani and Barsaat at the age of 70.

The world's oldest mother Omkari Singh, 76, says she finds it hard to keep up with her six-year-old son at times, but that she could not be more happy

Mrs Singh and her husband Charan, 89, made headlines in 2008 after their twins Akashvani and Barsaat - who has sadly died - were born

Elderly Mrs Singh says she is often mistaken for being her son's grandmother because of the 70-year age gap

The female twin Barsaat tragically died at the age of four, but her son is perfectly healthy.

Despite receiving a barrage of criticism both online and from her local community for having children so late in life, Mrs Singh, who is married to Charan, 89, says she could not be more happy. 

She said: 'Many people ask me, "Is he your grandson?" I tell them "No. He is my son".

'I am very happy that I am a mother of a six-year-old son. It is an unexplainable feeling.'

Like any six-year-old, Akashvani is playful and full of life, with his elderly mother occasionally struggling to keep up - especially when it comes to getting her son ready for school.

She said: 'I am not able to bath him properly. I have problems getting him dressed. It is hard to run around and feed him. Old age is like this.' 

Six-year-old Akashvani is a handful like any other young, energetic boy, with Mrs Singh struggling to keep up at times

Mrs Singh came under fire for having a child at such a late age but says she wanted to make sure she had a son to take over her house after she dies

The mother (centre) hopes to be alive when her son gets married, but says she is not worried about death as her daughter Kamla, 50, will care for Akashvani if she dies

Veermati, another mother who lives in her village, said: 'It is good Omkari gave birth to a child at this age.

'According to me they took a correct decision. They have love among each other so it is good.'

Already parents to two daughters and grandparents to five, the couple were desperate to have a boy - eventually succeeding when their eldest daughter Kamla was 50 years old.

To pay for the IVF treatment vital to producing a male heir to the family's smallholdings, the Panwars sold their buffalos, mortgaged their land, spent their life savings and took out a credit card loan.

Mrs Singh said: 'I thought if I will give birth to a boy, I will become like other mothers. Without a son, there was no life for me. Because, who would own this house if I had no sons?'

While she adores her son, the 76-year-old knows that age is not on her side - but hopes to live long enough to see Amritwani getting married.

She said: 'I am not worried. After my death my daughter will take care of my son.

'I wish my son gets married very quickly and we both can be present at his wedding.'

Until that time comes, the Singhs plan to make the most of their time with their son.
