A Sunwing flight from Canada to Mexico had to make an unexpected pit stop in Montana after extreme turbulence injured one person.

Turbulence encountered by the Edmonton, Canada to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico flight around 7.00am caused injury to a stewardess. The flight diverted to Helena for check-ups on both her and the jet.

An ambulance was waiting on the tarmac when the plane landed, a Helena Regional Airport spokesperson told KXLH, but the stewardess was cleared to resume flying.

The plane was not so lucky, it was grounded – a replacement plane was expected to arrive at about 4.00pm local time, according to the Helena Independent Record.

Even worse, the passengers were forced to wait several hours inside the Boeing 737 until a customs agent was able to arrive and clear them to deplane, the paper noted.

Flights are not normally rerouted to Helena’s airport, according to the paper, the last one occurred ‘several months ago.’
