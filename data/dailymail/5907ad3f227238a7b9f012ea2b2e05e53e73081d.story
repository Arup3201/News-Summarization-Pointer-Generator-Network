Eidur Gudjohnsen has signed for Bolton on a short-term deal.

The Iceland striker, 36, has been training with the club, who he left in 2000 for Chelsea, and played for the Under 21s against Middlesbrough on Monday.

Gudjohnsen has been a free agent since leaving Belgian outfit Club Brugge in the summer.

He has also played for the likes of Chelsea, Barcelona, Tottenham, Monaco and PSV Eindhoven in his illustrious career.

Bolton manager Neil Lennon said: 'I'm delighted to have Eidur on board. I think he will be a big game player and he is relishing getting back out on the field.

'It may take him a little time to adjust to the Championship and the style of play that is required of him, but that said however, he has come in with a completely open mind – he's motivated, he's done everything that has been asked of him on the physical side of things and he can only get better.

'In terms of his footballing ability, we all know what he is capable of and that is an exciting prospect.

'He is a quality player, and he knows exactly what we expect of him going forward – he is definitely looking forward to the challenge ahead of him.' 

Gudjohnsen was at Bolton from 1998 to 2000 before making his big-money move to Stamford Bridge.

Bolton are looking at getting international clearance so the forward can play at Reading on Saturday. 

Wanderers manager Neil Lennon is looking to sign another 36-year-old, his former Leicester team-mate Emile Heskey.

Lennon said earlier in the week: 'Emile is a free agent, I know him very well from my time at Leicester and he's another player we tried to sign in our time at Celtic.

'He may be coming to the end of his career but he still has very good attributes. It's no-gamble stuff for us, we're just bringing him in and going to have a look over the next 10 days, two weeks - see if he's got something to offer.

'If he has we'll look at it, if he hasn't we'll say, 'Thanks for coming in but we're not going to pursue this'.'
