One to watch

Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani top-scored for Algeria in qualifying with five and has an impressive 10 goals in just 19 games. A powerful front man and will be Algeria’s major attacking threat.

Familiar face

Take your pick from the Belgian line-up — 12 of their squad are owned by Premier League clubs, but there’s no doubt who the star man is. Eden Hazard had a sensational season for Chelsea. Can he keep it up on the world stage?

History lesson

Don’t expect goals from Algeria. They haven’t scored at the World Cup since 1986 and Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois saved 87.1 per cent of shots in qualifying.
