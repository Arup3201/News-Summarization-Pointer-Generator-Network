Police withdrew their Tasers and ordered him to lie on the ground, and when he refused they were unable to use the electroshock weapon due to his 'bulky clothing' stopping contact

During the 52-second footage Brown shoved the two cops and hit one in the face, knocking him over. 

According to the police report: 'The officers asked for his complaince but the subject refused.'

Police withdrew their Tasers and ordered him to lie on the ground, and when he refused they were unable to use the electroshock weapon due to his 'bulky clothing' stopping contact. 

'F--- the police,' can be heard in the audio, presumably being yelled by the man filming the fight.

The footage was posted to Photography Is Not a Crime on Tuesday and to LiveLeak, KTLA reports.

Upon the arrival of a third officer who as able to effectively use his Taser, Brown was taken into custody.

He was allegedly held on suspicion of felony obstructing/resisting an officer and assault against a police officer.

He is being held on $100,000 bond. 

Brown was convicted of forcibly resisting an officer in 2009.

In October he was convicted for lewd acts upon a child 13 or 15 years old, but reports are unclear as to whether he served time for the conviction.
