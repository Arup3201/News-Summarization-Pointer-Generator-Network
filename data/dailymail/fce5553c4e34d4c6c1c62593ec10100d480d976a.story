A few young fisherman in Florida hauled in more than they bargained for when they went shark fishing last week off beaches of Broward County - they expected a few small sharks. What they got was a 700-pound, 14-foot hammerhead.

Florida Atlantic University student Viktor Hluben and his friends knew they had something big after battling with the fish for more than 90 minutes.

However, they didn't realize how big the animal was until they got it out of the water.

Catch and release: After hauling the giant shark into shore, the group released it back into the ocean

'We knew we had a giant fish on, we battled it for about an hour and 
thirty minutes, and when we saw the massive dorsal fin, we knew we 
hooked a giant shark,' Hluben told WPTV.

Their intention was never to keep the shark - Hluben and his friends just wanted a few pictures to remember it by.

'The only thing I was thinking in my head was pictures, video, quick and get it back in the water,' Hluben said.

After posing for a few photos with the giant shark, the group pushed it back into the ocean and it swam off.

A shark that size near the coast of Florida might seem hard to believe, but experts say even larger hammerheads are actually quite common in Florida.

Mark Perry of the Florida Oceanographic Society tells WPTV that the Florida coastline is full of hammerheads that big - and some even bigger.

According to Perry, hammerheads along the coast grow up to about 19 feet and actually are fairly common.

He says, however, that hammerheads aren'ts as aggressive as tiger or bull sharks, which are responsible for many of the shark attacks in the area.

Hluben is part of a group of young fisherman who call their group 'Landshark Fishing.' The group, Hluben says, fishes at night for large sharks.

Hluben and his group of shark hunters have no intention of hurting the large sharks they haul in at the beach - they let the sharks go after bringing them in, and use 'circle hooks to ensure maximum health of the fish.

Hluben says the monster they brought in last week has only inspired him to go bigger.

'Now I want to go out and catch a bigger shark, maybe a 1,000 pounder next time,' Hluben told the station.
