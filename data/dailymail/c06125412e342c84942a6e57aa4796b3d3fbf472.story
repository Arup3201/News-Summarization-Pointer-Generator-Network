An explosive text message sent by the treasurer of the federal Liberal Party referred to Tony Abbott's chief of staff as a 'horsewoman of the Apocalypse' as he urged for her to be dumped.

The string of text messages from party treasurer Philip Higginson were sent to a senior Liberal figure last year about staffer Peta Credlin and leaked to the ABC's Four Corners.

Mr Higginson, who urged his Liberal colleague to 'negotiate the removal' of the PM's chief of staff, sent the messages during a dispute over annual accounts with Ms Credlin's husband and Liberal Party federal director, Brian Loughnane.

The string of text messages from party treasurer Philip Higginson were sent to a senior Liberal figure last year about staffer Peta Credlin and leaked to the ABC's Four Corners

'I'm refusing to sign the 2013/14 accounts... it has brought... the Horsewoman of the Apocalypse out of her den as you can image (sic). Black robes flowing. Stay tuned for the hatchet job on me... it's hurting me just mainly watching the party suicide,' Mr Higginson wrote.

'I do hope you can negotiate the removal of Credlin. That would be a huge win in itself.' 

Liberal sources believe the dispute was involved in the Prime Minister's leadership crisis this year.

Mr Higginson signed the party accounts in February, but wrote emails to the Liberal Party executive in which he described Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane's relationship as a 'conflict of interest'.

Mr Higginson was considered a good friend of Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he sent the text messages late last year urging for the chief of staff to be dumped

Mr Higginson urged his Liberal colleague to 'negotiate the removal' of the PM's chief of staff Peta Credlin and referred to her as the 'Horsewoman of the Apocalypse'

He wrote that 'how this party ever let a husband and wife team into those roles' was beyond him, and that their relationship was causing dysfunction and 'wooden and unreliable communication'.

Mr Abbott downplayed the emails at the time saying the leak was a 'storm in a teacup'. He restated his confidence in the power couple. 

He pointed out that Mr Loughnane has been the federal director for 12 years and Ms Credlin has occupied a series of senior positions for various ministers and party leaders.

'So if this is a problem, it's been a problem for 10 years. In fact it is no problem,' Mr Abbott told told Macquarie Radio.

But Four Corners has revealed the issue led to Mr Abbott and Mr Higginson having a heated meeting before Christmas.

The Prime Minister wouldn't comment on the meeting, according to the program.

Ms Credlin has been credited by disgruntled coalition backbenchers, 39 of whom voted for a spill in February, as one of the problems with Mr Abbott's leadership.

Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop says the latest internal party leaks are damaging and should stop.

'It's always unfortunate if there are leaks to the media that are damaging in any political party,' she said.

'Anything of that nature is obviously most unfortunate and shouldn't be said.'
