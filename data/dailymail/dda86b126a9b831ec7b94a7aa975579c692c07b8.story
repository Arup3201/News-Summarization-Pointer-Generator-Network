Prince Charles spoke out last night for Christians targeted by fanatics in the Middle East.

He said bridges between Christianity and Islam were being ‘deliberately destroyed’ by people with vested interests.

‘For 20 years I have tried to build bridges between Islam and Christianity to dispel ignorance and misunderstanding,’ he told a reception for Middle East Christians at Clarence House in London.

The Prince told a reception for Middle East Christians that bridges between Christianity and Islam were being 'deliberately destroyed'

‘The point though surely is that we have now reached a crisis where bridges are rapidly being deliberately destroyed by those with a vested interest in doing so.

‘This is achieved through intimidation, false accusation and organised persecution including to the Christian communities in the Middle East.’

He said this affected Arab Christians in Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt as well as those from other Arab countries.

‘I have for some time now been deeply troubled by the growing difficulties faced by Christian communities in various parts of the Middle East,’ he said.

‘It seems to me that we cannot ignore the fact that Christians in the Middle East are increasingly being deliberately targeted by fundamentalist Islamist militants.

People with a 'vested interest' are harming relations between the two religions, the Prince said

Prince Charles said the issues affected Arab Christians in Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt

‘Christianity was literally born in the Middle East and we must not forget our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters in Christ.’

Charles said Christians now accounted for 4 per cent of the population in the Middle East and North Africa - the lowest concentration in the world.

It is clear that the Christian population of the Middle East has dropped dramatically over the last century and is falling still further,’ he added.

He said the decline of the ‘irreplaceably precious’ Christian tradition in the Middle East represented a ‘major blow’ to peace in the region as Christians were part of the ‘fabric of society’ often acting as bridge builders with other communities.

Charles’s remarks were made after he met Christians from the Middle East at the reception.

Earlier he toured the Coptic Orthodox Church centre in Stevenage and met Syrian Orthodox Christians in West London.
