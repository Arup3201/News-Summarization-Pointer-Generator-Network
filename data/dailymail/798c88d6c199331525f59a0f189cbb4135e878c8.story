Prince Charles jokingly admitted that he is impatient

Prince Charles, the longest-waiting heir to the throne in British history, has spoken of his 'impatience' to get things done. 

Joking about the vigour with which he pursues his pet projects, he declared: 'Impatient? Me? What a thing to suggest! Yes, of course I am.'

He added: 'I'll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffed it if I'm not careful.'

Charles was speaking a few days before his 64th birthday during a visit to Dumfries House, a stately home in East Ayrshire he has helped save for the nation.

The comments, which were recorded for a film on the Clarence House website, were in the context of his involvement with Dumfries House.

But they will fuel speculation that the Prince is more eager than ever to take the throne.

In 2008, he became the longest-waiting heir in British history, overtaking his great-great grandfather Edward VII.

Courtiers insist Charles is fulfilled by his present role as one of the hardest-working members of the royal family, undertaking hundreds of charitable engagements a year.

But many royal commentators have suggested he feels frustrated his reign has not yet begun. With a history of longevity in his family – the Queen is 86 and in good health while the Queen Mother lived to 101 – Charles may have some time to wait until he succeeds his mother.

He has nothing but praise for the way the Queen has led her country  for 60 years.

But he has previously hinted at his impatience with the long wait for succession. In 1992, when his then-brother-in-law Charles Spencer became Earl Spencer on the death of his father, Charles told him: 'You are fortunate enough to have succeeded to the title when still young.'

In 2004, after a Guards officer  congratulated him on his 56th birthday, the Prince is reported to have said: 'I'm now at the age at which my grandfather died.'

Professor Robert Hazell, director of University College London's constitution unit, said Charles had to fit a unique job description.

'He is an age when most people are starting to contemplate retirement, yet he's not actually started the job he has spent  his adult life preparing for. That is burdensome.'

Royal biographer Penny Junor said: 'He is impatient, but when he becomes king, his activities and all the projects he most enjoys where he can make a difference will be seriously curtailed.'
