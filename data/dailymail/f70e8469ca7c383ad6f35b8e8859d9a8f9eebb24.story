Danny Welbeck’s impressive start to his Arsenal career can largely be attributed to the players and backroom staff assembled at the Emirates, according to Calum Chambers.

Chambers, who also arrived at the Gunners this summer following a £12million move from Southampton, has praised the welcoming nature of the squad and staff at the north London club.

‘He has settled in really well,’ said Chambers of his team-mate, after the former Manchester United striker scored a hat-trick in Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Galatasaray at the Emirates on Wednesday night.

Chambers added: ‘When I first came, I said the bunch of lads here and the staff are so welcoming to a new person that it is hard not to settle in quickly to be honest.'

Welbeck's treble takes him to four goals in five appearances for the Gunners and also marked the first professional hat-trick of his career.  

‘He is an athlete with pace and power on the ball and he is willing to work hard,' said Chambers. 'He is a goalscorer, so he is everything you could ask for. He is a great influence for the team.’

Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal’s £30million arrival from Barcelona, has also impressed since signing from the Nou Camp.

Sanchez scored Arsenal’s third goal on the night with a well-taken finish shortly before the interval.

But the Chile international was later substituted and was seen nursing a knock to his ankle with an ice pack ahead of Sunday’s London derby against Chelsea.

Ahead of the clash at Stamford Bridge, Chambers said: 'We will go into it with high hopes and we are on a good run. 

'We had a good result tonight and we will give it our best shot. It will be a tough game, but we will go into it 100 per cent focused and look for a result.'
