A gym instructor who paid £4,000 for a boob job was horrified when surgeons first made her breats too big - and then the implants exploded inside her.

Kim Brockhurst, 51, went under the knife hoping to increase her 32AA breasts by two cup sizes.

But she was shocked when she came round after the surgery to find she had a pair of huge DD breasts.

Ms Brockhurst learned to live with her oversized chest until she discovered she had been given faulty PIP implants which had burst, leaking industrial grade silicone into her body.

To make matters worse, she only learned of the problem when her new breasts became lumpy and misshapen.

She said: ‘I was really flat chested and I wanted a bit more bounce.

‘So I saved up for the surgery hoping it would give me a nice confidence boost.

‘But I ended up with these big heavy breasts - much bigger than I’d asked for.

‘But it got worse when my breasts slowly went out of shape - it was a terrible time.

After surgery Ms Brockhurst noticed her breasts becoming lumpy and misshapen. She then discovered she had been given faulty PIP implants which had to be removed. She is pictured after reconstructive surgery

Ms Brockhurst (pictured with her partner, George-Edward King) is now worried because she knows silicone from the implants leaked into her body and she doesn't know the long-term consequences

‘Soon I had a big dent in my right breast and the implant on the left just exploded - leaking the implant’s industrial strength silicone into my breast tissue.’

Almost 50,000 women in the UK, and some 400,000 worldwide, were affected by the scandal which came to light after doctors found unexpectedly high numbers of women were suffering from ruptured implants.

It  emerged that the French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses.

Ms Brockhurst had just gone through a painful divorce when she had surgery in 2004.

She asked doctors to boost her chest to a modest 32B.

However, in June 2013, doctors confirmed her surgeon used the medically unauthorised PIP implants which were leaking and she says the implants were much bigger than she requested.

She was then told they could be removed on the NHS, but not replaced.

Ms Brockhurst, from Ebbw Vale, South Wales, said: ‘The NHS would take out the implants but wanted £3,800 to restructure my breasts.

Ms Brockhurst (pictured right after having reconstructive surgery following the removal of her PIP implants) says she is now happy having smaller breasts, which are better for her job as a yoga and Pilates instructor

‘It was awful knowing I couldn’t afford that surgery but all the while I had silicone leaking into my body. I still don’t know where it’s gone and that’s a real worry.’

Ms Brockhurst finally had her breasts taken down to a more manageable 34D in an operation paid for and recorded by Channel 5 reality TV show Botched Up Bodies in July 2013.

She says her new streamlined shape is ideal for her job teaching yoga and Pilates.

She said: ‘Everyone says it’s taken years off me.

‘I can go out running again and dance and move without having to strap myself down.

‘Sometimes it’s nice not to have a big cleavage.’
