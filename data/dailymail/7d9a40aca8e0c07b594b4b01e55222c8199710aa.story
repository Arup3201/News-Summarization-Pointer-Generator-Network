Six men have been arrested over the rape of a woman on a coach in northern India in an attack which has disturbing echoes of the gang-rape and murder of a student on a New Delhi bus just weeks ago.

The victim was travelling to her in-laws' home in Punjab on Friday when she was allegedly snatched and driven to a district bordering Amritsar, the Sikh holy city.

Five men joined the driver and conductor, who had taken her by motorbike to an unknown address, and took turns to rape the 29-year-old.

They dumped her near her in-laws' village the next morning where she told relatives of her ordeal, police said.

'Six
men have been arrested on allegations of having raped a 29-year-old 
woman... after forcibly taking her to an unknown location on the night 
of January 11,' local police officer Raj Jeet Singh said.

A seventh suspect is still on the run from the police, he added.

'The lady, after being kidnapped, was raped brutally throughout the night by the seven accused,' he said.

'After
raping the victim throughout the night, one of the accused dropped her 
near her in-laws' house the next morning where she narrated the whole 
incident to her two sisters-in-law.'

Asked why she had not resisted when she was being taken by motorcycle to the secluded spot where she was attacked, Superintendent Singh said she was 'a bit mentally weak', the Indian Express reported.

The extent of the victims injuries had yet to be established, but an initial examination confirmed she had been raped, the Deccan Chronicle reported.

Local news services are reporting that the suspects have confessed during preliminary interrogations.

The attack is disturbingly similar to the December 16 gang-rape and murder of a 21-year-old studentÂ  in Delhi, where five men are on trial in a case that has fuelled anger across India over the treatment of women.

Partap Singh Bajwa, a local Congress Party politician, blamed the police for not enforcing stringent checks on buses operating in the state.

'It all happened due to laxity of police as they never bother to check out the buses moving on national highways during night time,' Bajwa told AFP.

Protesters across India have called for the police to be more vigilant and sensitive to the growing incidence of sexual assault against women, after details emerged of the New Delhi attack.

Police and prosecutors have outlined how the alleged rapists picked up the woman and her male companion in a school bus which they had taken for a joyride after drinking heavily.

The bus would have had to cross numerous police checkpoints at that time of night but at no stage was the vehicle pulled over by officers.

After getting into an argument with the woman's male companion, the group allegedly beat him up and raped the victim in the back of the bus while driving around Delhi for some 45 minutes.

They also sexually assaulted her with a rusted metal bar, leaving her with severe internal injuries, before hurling her from the vehicle.

She died in a Singapore hospital 13 days after the attack.
