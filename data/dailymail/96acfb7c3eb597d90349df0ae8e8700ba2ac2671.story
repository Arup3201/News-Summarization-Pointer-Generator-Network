Social housing repair workers at a cash-strapped council have received a staggering £3.7million in bonuses in less than two years, it has been revealed. 

An investigation has been launched after Homes for Haringey staff at Haringey Council in north London were found to have pocketed the astonishing amount, despite huge budget cuts.

One employee in the Labour-run authority's social housing arm's repairs department received a bonus of £54,292 for work carried out between April 2012 and March this year.

This was on top of a basic salary of between £25,970 and £28,068 a year, according to figures obtained by local newspaper the Ham & High.

During the last financial year, repairs staff took home £2,626,534 - a year in which Haringey repairs service (HRS) smashed its budget by an incredible £1.53million.

Several staff have now been suspended as the inquiry into the 'level of earnings for some operatives' is carried out, a council source said.

Concerned: Lib Dem Councillor Richard Wilson has demanded an investigation to expose the truth

One worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'What they have had to do [to counteract the overspend] is change the way working is done and innocent people have lost their jobs for it.'

The bonus system was introduced by Homes for Haringey 
in October 2011 to 'improve productivity, quality and residents' 
satisfaction with repairs'.

It is not known how much the repairs service - set up in April 2006 - thought it would pay out when it introduced the scheme in one of the most deprived areas of England.

A Homes for Haringey spokesman said the massive budget-busting sum spent in 2012/13 would 'not impact on the repairs service Homes for Haringey offers tenants and leaseholders'.

He said: 'During 2012/13, we carried out more than 53,000 repairs on behalf of our tenants and this did lead to an overspend on the repairs budget in 2012/13.

'We have now launched an improvement project - overseen by the Homes for Haringey board and a recently appointed a new senior manager for repairs - that is helping us to drive down costs while continuing to improve customer satisfaction.'

But Councillor Richard Wilson, housing spokesman for Haringey's Liberal Democrat opposition, demanded an investigation to expose the truth.

Cllr Wilson said: 'I am very concerned 
that bonuses paid to repairs staff have soared to more than £2million - 
whilst at the same time many local council tenants and leaseholders are 
tightening their belts and struggling to make ends meet.

'I have received many complaints from residents about housing repairs not being done promptly or correctly so I am very surprised that such high bonuses have been paid.

'This is public money that should have gone on housing services for local people.'

Homes for Haringey manages about 20,000 houses for the council.
