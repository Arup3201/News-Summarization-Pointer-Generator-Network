Ronald Koeman admits Southampton's injury pile-up may force him into the transfer market next month as he attempts to extend a wonderful start to the campaign.

Koeman lost Jack Cork and Toby Alderweireld during the 1-0 defeat at Arsenal on Wednesday and does not expect key midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin to be fit for Monday's game at home to Manchester United.

Saints are third in the Barclays Premier League after 14 games but have not won in three outings and the manager fears the demanding festive fixture list will take its toll on clubs like his, with smaller squads.

Koeman said: 'We like to be competitive until the end of the season. There's the Asia Cup in January for Maya Yoshida and Africa Cup of Nations for Sadio Mane.

'We have spoken already about this situation. We are looking and with these kinds of injuries, maybe with these kind of injuries you have to do something.

'With Morgan we have to wait. I don't think he will be fit for Monday but may the weekend after. Jack has hurt the same ankle as last season. With Toby we have to wait but a hamstring is always minimum two weeks and usually longer.

'Dusan Tadic was also a little bit injured and tired. We play a lot. You see injuries in all teams. That's the risk in football. That's the number of games they have to play.

'Southampton don't have the number of players Arsenal have, when you look in the stand and on the bench.

'We don't have that, and that is the problem for the lower teams with  this schedule in games in December.'

Dusan Tadic also picked up a knock against Arsenal as the injuries continue to pile up for Southampton
