A self-proclaimed, pro-surfer and model who allegedly tried to kill an elderly woman with her car has been re-arrested.  

Jill Hansen, 30, was handcuffed by police on Saturday afternoon after she reportedly violated a protective order at the Women's Community Correctional Center in Kailua, Hawaii. She is due in court on September 5 over the violation.  

Hansen pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder of a 73-year-old woman in a Wakiki parking garage in May along with vehicle break-in and car theft.

Jill Hansen, 30,  is charged with attempted murder for trying to run over an elderly woman with her car. She was arrested again on Saturday (pictured) for violating a protective order

Hansen allegedly smashed into an elderly woman with her car in May putting the 73-year-old in hospital 

Police said Hansen ran into Elizabeth Conklin with her car and backed up to hit her again. 

The elderly woman was taken to hospital in a serious condition with a head injury, cuts and bruises.

Hansen was arraigned in Circuit Court in May via closed circuit video link with Oahu Community Correctional Center. She is being held on $1 million bail.

Authorities initially believed the attack stemmed from an earlier road rage run-in, however Ms Conklin said there was no such encounter, instead assuming Hansen was trying to steal her car.

'I parked in my normal parking place, and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance,' Conklin told ABC News.

The 73-year-old thanked Chris Khory, the worker who stopped Hansen, for saving her life.

Khory told Khon2 that after knocking Conklin down, Hansen got out of her sedan, looked at the victim lying on the ground, got back in the car and reversed, preparing to hit her again.

Hansen, a self-proclaimed pro-surfer, was arrested on suspicion of intentionally striking a 73-year-old woman in a Wai­kiki parking garage with her car in May 

Khory, who works at a nearby apartment complex, said he quickly grabbed a nearby crowbar and ran over and smashed Hansen's back window. Stunned, Hansen got out and fled, leaving behind her car.

Police used it to track her down, arresting Hansen six hours later in the Manoa area, and later charged with attempted murder.

However, before she was arrested, Hansen posted a picture of a BMW 328 wagon - believed to be the same car as Conklin's - along with a message about how she had turned professional as a surfer.

'I am becoming a professional! I have worked SOOOO hard to get to today. I am so greatful [sic] for all the support of the surfers and the ASP (association of surfing professionals),' Hansen posted on May 14, along with the picture of the car. 

It is yet another run-in with police for Hansen. She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation.

There is also an active restraining order filed by her father. According to the court documents, her father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family.

Lucky to be alive: Elizabeth Conklin, 73, who was thrown 20 feet across the parking garage of her Waikiki apartment complex said her attacker was after her car

She has multiple rants on the social media site. She claims to be a professional surfer and model and lashes out at critics.  

According to court records, Hansen has been cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time in May. In that incident she was allegedly driving 72mph in a 35mph zone in Wahiawa.  

In addition, in 2011 she received fines for disregarding a stop sign, driving without a license and driving without insurance. In 2013 she was fined for driving without headlights.

She has two convictions, one for speeding and the other for driving without a license in 2010, according to the state Criminal Justice Data Center.

On May 21, Hansen attempted to slip out of jail in Honolulu by falling in line behind someone who was walking out the exit, police say. Jail guards immediately recognized the ruse and detained her again.

'She tried to slip out behind someone who was walking through the door,' jail spokesman Toni Schwartz told KHNL-TV. 

'Thanks to the quick actions of our staff, they immediately grabbed her and stopped her from getting any further.' 

She is due back in court on September 25 to determine whether she is fit to stand trial fpr attempted murder.

In an effort to get Hansen's attention and stop her from hitting the woman again, a bystander used a crowbar to break one of the car's windows
