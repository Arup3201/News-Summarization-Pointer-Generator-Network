Marijuana is much stronger than it was three decades ago, experts have warned.

Scientists found cannabis smoked today has tripled in strength since the 1980s.

Marijuana now contains increasingly high concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound which gives the 'high'.

But concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), a lesser known compound that is being investigated for its medical proponents, but does not create a 'high', has gone down.

Samples also contained contaminants including bacteria, fungi, butane and heavy metals, scientists found.

Super strong: Marijuana sold on the market today has tripled in strength since the 1980s, scientists  warn

The research was carried out by Dr Andy LaFrate, the president and director of research of Charas Scientific, a lab in Colorado, US, which carries out potency testing on marijuana samples on the market today.

Presenting his preliminary findings at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), he found that marijuana has tripled in strength in the last 30 years.

He said: 'We've seen a big increase in marijuana potency compared to where it was 20 or 30 years ago.

'I would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of three.'

The average potencies of the samples he analysed was 20 per cent THC, but he saw  values close to 30 per cent, which he described as'huge'.

He explained that 30 years ago, THC levels in marijuana were well below 10 per cent.

The THC content of cannabis has tripled in some strains because producers have been cross-breeding them over the years as users demand stronger drugs, he said.

He added that an unexpected consequence of the breeding was that many of the samples his lab tested contained little to no CBD.

Researchers are currently investigating CBD as a treatment for schizophrenia, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as anxiety and depression.

But unlike THC, CBD doesn't get provide the same 'high', which is why it could be considered in treatments for children.

Dr LaFrate said he was shocked by the levels of contaminants in samples of marijuana producers had voluntarily sent to the lab for testing.

He said: 'One thing that's been surprising is the level of microbial contamination in marijuana.'

'Many of the samples were covered in fungi or bacterial contaminants.

'Others had Butane, which are used to create marijuana extracts, and others had heavy metals.'

This isn't necessarily a cause for alarm, but it could spark discussions on what are safe levels of contaminants.

Dr LaFrate said: 'It's a natural product. There's going to be microbial growth on it no matter what you do.

'So the questions become: What's a safe threshold? And which contaminants do we need to be concerned about?'
