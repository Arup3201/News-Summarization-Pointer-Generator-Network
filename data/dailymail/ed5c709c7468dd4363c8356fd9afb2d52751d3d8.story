A New Jersey man who sparked controversy among his neighbors for flying a flag that is now associated with the jihadist group Islamic State says the whole thing has been a big misunderstanding.

Mark Dunaway, of Garwood, says he's been flying the flag most Fridays and during the holy month of Ramadan for 10 years, since long before ISIS militants adopted the symbol as their own.

For Dunaway, the flag — which says in Arabic, 'There is only one god, Allah, and the prophet Muhammad is his messenger' — is just a symbol of his faith.

'Every Muslim uses that black flag,' Dunway, 44, told NJ.com. 'You'll find it in any mosque in world.

'I am an American citizen and I love my country,  but I am also a Muslim and I use that flag to say I’m a Muslim.'

Mr Dunaway has been flying this flag outside his Garwood, New Jersey, home for years. His neighbors recently noticed it and thought Dunaway was supporting ISIS jihadists

Kashmiri demonstrators hold up a flag of the Islamic State during a demonstration against Israeli military operations in Gaza. Although the group adopted the flag, it has long been a symbol of Islam and is was not historically associated with terrorist groups

The controversy began on Tuesday when investment manager Marc Leibowitz tweeted a photo of the flag and commented: 'Scary!'

'Jihadists are now in Garwood,' wrote one commenter on the photo.

'I think it's not right at this time to be flying that type of flag,' local resident James McHugh told News 12. 'Especially with what's going on at this time.'

Neighbor Diana Figueiredo says Dunaway and his flag are harmless — but she does worry about the people making a stink out of the situation.

'He goes to work every day, he never bothers anyone, he keeps to 
himself,' she told NJ.com.

'I'm more
 concerned about the crazy people saying they're going to retaliate and 
set his house on fire,' she added. 'They're the extremists.'

Dunaway has since voluntarily removed his flag.

'If people are that offended by it, it is censorship," he told News 12. 'But I might not have to fly it for a while. Maybe one day I'll be able to fly it again.'
