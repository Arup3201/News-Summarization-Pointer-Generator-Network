A university student tore her windpipe and put her life at risk when she drank so much that she spent 24 hours being sick.

Megan Thomason, 21, spent six days in hospital with serious complications from the injury after taking advantage of cheap drinks promotions in bars.

Doctors feared she could suffocate or develop blood poisoning, Miss Thomason said, adding that she ‘nearly died’.

Her neck and face swelled up and her bulging cheeks made her ‘look like a hamster’.

Miss Thomason, who is studying business and management at Hull University, has said she will give up alcohol and warned of the dangers of binge drinking.

She accepted responsibility for making herself seriously ill, but added that cheap drinks deals offered by bars and clubs pose a big health risk to young people.

She said: ‘We automatically think if it’s cheaper we can afford to drink more and that’s not good.

‘People can have ten or 20 drinks a night.

'You don’t realise what one night out could do. It was the worst experience of my whole life. People say they get hung over but I nearly died.’

Miss Thomason went on a night out 
with friends in York in June and downed three triple vodka and cokes 
that cost only £2.89 each, thanks to a special offer.

The student from Barlby, North Yorkshire, said: ‘Being drunk is classed as normal and I gave in to peer pressure.

‘I’d had three drinks but because they were triples it was actually the equivalent of nine drinks and you don’t think of that at the time.’

The group went to two more bars, where Miss Thomason had more vodka-based drinks before going to a friend’s house.

Her stepfather picked her up early the next morning and she started a 24-hour period of vomiting and retching, which caused damage to her throat.

She was prescribed anti-nausea medication, but when it did not improve her condition she was taken to hospital.

Doctors
 noticed her facial swelling and discovered her windpipe was torn. The 
injury resulted in a condition known as subcutaneous emphysema, in which
 air becomes trapped in a layer of skin.

Megan Thomason takes responsibility for her ordeal but thinks cheap drinks promotions are partly to blame for luring skint students in

‘They realised my face had blown up. My cheeks looked a bit like a hamster with all the food in them,’ she said.

‘Basically it felt like bubble wrap inside my cheeks and my mouth and chest.’

'She
 spent the next six days in hospital, not eating or drinking, as her 
throat healed. She added: ‘It is only now I realise just how serious it 
was.

‘If I had eaten I could have got blood poisoning from the food or I could have choked if it had gone into my lungs.

‘It was just one night out for a few drinks and it left me in hospital for a week – I could have died.’

Miss Thomason has now been told that her body lacks the enzymes needed to break down alcohol properly.

Her mother Justine Bean, 45, an administrator, and site supervisor stepfather Gary Bean, 48, have urged her not to drink again.

Professor Paul Wallace, the chief medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: ‘The main danger of drinking alcoholic drinks is the alcohol itself and its effect on your brain and your body.

‘It doesn’t much matter whether you drink it in wine, beer, spirits or anything else – the alcohol is what causes the effect on your brain and your body.

'And the more you have, the more dangerous it becomes.’
