A Los Angeles soccer team is being 'ethnically cleansed' as part of a strategy by the billionaire owner to Mexicanize it, a former employee has claimed.

In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, former Chivas USA human resources director Cynthia Craig has alleged that a culture of harassment and discrimination caused her departure.

The African-American claims she was forced out of her job in July by the team's owner Jorge Vergara and president, Jose David, because she was not Mexican and could not speak Spanish.

The former youth academy coaches, Daniel Calichman and Teddy Chronopoulos, have also alleged that they were victims of the team's purging of non-Mexican players and coaches, according to Fox News.

The men, who are both white, filed their complaint in May.

Since assuming majority ownership of 
Chivas USA in August last year, Mr Vergara made it clear he wanted to 
replicate the team of the same name in Guadalajara, Mexico, in order to attract the large Mexican population in Los Angeles.

According to the 2012 census, more than four million Mexicans live in the area.

The original Mexican Chivas pro-team has only hired Mexican players since 1908, according to CNN.

In the lawsuit brought by Mr Chronopoulos and Mr Calichman, attorney Greg Helmer said: 'Mr Vergara undertook
a systemic effort to reverse what he perceived as the "Americanization" of Chivas USA and to implement a discriminatory employment policy 
similar to the ethnocentric "Mexican only" policy that exists at Chivas 
de Guadalajara.'

Mr Helmer told Fox News: 'In the U.S. and in California, sports franchises have to abide by the same rules and laws that all employers are required to follow, including the laws prohibiting employment discrimination.'

It is claimed that in a staff meeting in November, Mr Vergara asked, in Spanish, for those who could speak the language to raise their hands.

After identifying employees who did not speak Spanish, he allegedly told them they were fired.

In her lawsuit, Ms Craig said it felt like 'ethnic cleansing'.

Mr Chronopoulos has alleged that after the meeting, newly appointed team president Mr David asked him to research the ethnicity of current youth academy players and coaches. 

The request and recent changes led to Mr Chronopoulos and Mr Calichman filing a harassment and discrimination complaint with the team's human resources department.

Three days later however, the men were asked to leave.

Since Mr Vergara took over about seven non-Latino academy employees, including the two coaches, have had their contracts terminated, the lawsuit said.

'In contrast, no Latino employees have been terminated,' the suit states, according to CNN.

Many non-Spanish speaking players have joined the youth program for LA Galaxy, which Chivas shares a stadium with.

SB Nation pointed out however, that while many players may have a Latino background, most of the team is American.

A spokesman for Chivas USA declined to comment on the legal matter.

Major League Soccer has not made any public statements about the alleged discrimination.

'We are well aware of the allegations made by ex-players and employees of Chivas USA,' MLA's executive vice president, communications, Dan Courtemanche said.

'it would not be appropriate for us to say anything more when the litigation is ongoing,' he told Fox News, but added that Chivas USA has players from 15 countries.
