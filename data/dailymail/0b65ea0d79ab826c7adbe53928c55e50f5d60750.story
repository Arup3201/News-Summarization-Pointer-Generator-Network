The details of hundreds of child abuse victims may have been leaked after officials failed to post sensitive documents securely, a former senior investigator fears.

The year-long inquiry into historic claims that children were molested in care homes in Jersey is currently under way. 

Police have taken 1,776 statements in connection with 532 offences - with the 191 victims all entitled to anonymity. 

But former Jersey police chief, Lenny Harper, fears their details may have been accidentally leaked after a confidential document posted to him by inquiry officials arrived in an opened envelope.

Mr Harper, who looked into reports of child abuse on the island in 2007 and 2008, said the Jersey Care Inquiry sent him the 200-page document to sign, but failed to send it by recorded delivery.

He said the post office in the UK had resealed the package in a plastic bag because it had been damaged and inserted a letter of apology for the condition.   

Mr Harper has given evidence at the inquiry into reports of abuse in the island's children's homes and fostering services and said the document had contained 'the most sensitive information'.

Many victims were targeted in the Haut de la Garenne care home which closed in 1986. 

He said: 'There are details of alleged abusers, there are details of many victims and what victims were saying happened to them.

'There are details of allegations of corrupt behaviour by officials in Jersey and many other details of a sensitive nature.

'It could cause a lot of distress to a lot of people.

'My main concern obviously would be the victims who gave accounts of what had happened to them in confidence at that time.' 

The Jersey Care Inquiry said in response to Mr Harper's claims that it has 'deliberately chosen not to draw attention to post'. 

In a statement on their website, it says: 'The Inquiry is in contact with a wide range of witnesses, some of whom are on the island and some are not. 

'Much of our contact with witnesses is by telephone or electronic, but sometimes it is necessary to send documentation through the post, particularly to witnesses who are not on the island. 

'The Inquiry has deliberately chosen not to draw attention to post, which is sent in plain, non branded envelopes or plastic document bags in the normal post. 

'The Inquiry by necessity has to use the postal service on the island. 

'The Inquiry views with concern the reports from Mr Harper that his private mail has possibly been tampered with and has been in contact with Mr Harper.'
