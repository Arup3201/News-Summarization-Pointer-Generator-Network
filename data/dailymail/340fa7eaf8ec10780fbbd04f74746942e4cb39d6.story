Four climbers were killed today in an avalanche on one of Britain’s highest mountains.

They were part of a group of six which had defied warnings about the conditions to go climbing in the Glencoe area of the Scottish Highlands.

They were swept away by hundreds of tons of snow tumbling downhill.

A man in the party is thought to have 
escaped the fall and raised the alarm around 2pm, when search teams were
scrambled to the 3,772ft mountain, called Bidean Nam Bian.

Glencoe and Lochaber Mountain Rescue 
volunteers reached a woman – understood to have serious head injuries – 
who was taken to Belford Hospital in Fort William.

All six, three men and three women, had been located by early evening. Police confirmed that four were dead.

The group was climbing at the 
mountain’s Church Door Buttress when piles of snow slab hurtled down the
narrow channel’s rocky surface.

Mountaineer and former Glencoe Mountain Rescue team leader Hamish MacInnes described conditions as ‘hazardous’.

He said: ‘I was talking about the 
danger with a member of the mountain rescue committee just about an hour
before it happened because there was a heavy fall of snow.

‘It had been blowing a lot and forming a very fine powder. It was a fairly hazardous situation for avalanche.

‘I was speaking to some people who 
were up the mountain and the snow was drifting quite badly although a 
lot of it had gone, the temperature had risen. It was a hazardous wind, 
the conditions were quite bad.’

A statement issued by Northern 
Constabulary shortly before 6pm said: ‘Police can confirm that searchers
have now located all the members of a climbing party caught up in the 
avalanche at Glencoe.

‘The party of six had been climbing on
Bidean Nam Bian. One male member of the party raised the alarm and 
stayed  to assist the searchers at the scene.

‘One woman remains in a serious 
condition at Belford Hospital. Police are making efforts to trace the 
families of those involved.’

A member of staff at a hotel in 
Glencoe village, which is popular with hillwalkers, said the avalanche 
had ‘shocked’ the community.

She added: ‘All our guests who were 
out in the mountains have come back safely, which is a relief. There is 
an awful lot of snow about at the moment. It’s exceptionally wintry and 
conditions are not great.

‘Details are still a bit sketchy but 
we’ve heard the party came to grief coming down the mountain. It’s an 
area where you need to be careful. We’re shocked.’

Bidean Nam Bian, while stunning, is one of the most treacherous mountains in the Highlands.

Its terrain attracts climbers from all
over the world and is particularly steep, rocky and complex. There are 
sections of steep scree, where climbers have to scramble.

Two years ago, two people died in an 
avalanche in Glencoe, which an inquiry later said ‘no one could have 
foreseen’. Chris Walker, 29, from Keswick in Cumbria, and Robert 
Pritchard, 37, from New Malden in Surrey, were swept 1,500ft to their 
deaths.

The inquest heard how the walkers, ironically, changed their route to try to avoid avalanches.

Mark Diggins, co-ordinator of the 
Scottish Avalanche Information Service, said the weather conditions on 
the mountain yesterday had been fairly dry with little snow over the 
past four days.

He said yesterday’s avalanche risk had
been deemed ‘considerable’, the second lowest on a European four-point 
scale. The most serious is ‘very high’, extremely rare in Britain.

Mr Diggins added: ‘An avalanche can be
triggered by a single person. At the moment it doesn’t look like 
there’s much snow, it is very localised.’

Elsewhere, a woman was killed when 
several vehicles crashed on an icy road near Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 
Friday, and seven people were injured when a double-decker bus struck 
two cars in Coniston, near Hull.
