It is claimed that Anna Yearley, a senior aide to Ed Milliband, referred to Northerners as 'backward'

Labour last night threatened to sue one of its own MPs after he claimed a senior aide to Ed Miliband referred to Northerners as ‘backward’.

Austin Mitchell, 79, said Anna Yearley made the remark as they rowed about moves to get more young women from the North into Parliament.

Last night the party dismissed the claim as ‘completely ridiculous and completely untrue’.

And in an 
extraordinary move, Labour said it was considering bringing libel 
proceedings against Mr Mitchell, who has been an MP for nearly 40 years.

Mr
 Mitchell, who is standing down from his Great Grimsby seat at the next 
election, said the row erupted during meetings about his retirement with
 Miss Yearley, 35, Mr Miliband’s political secretary and ‘fixer’.

He
 alleges she told him that Labour activists in the North were ‘backward’
 for not nominating enough female MPs and had blocked moves to promote 
more women.

He
 said she was determined to make them toe the line – and claimed she 
talked to him like ‘an educationally subnormal pensioner’.

Mr
 Mitchell has claimed leading female Labour MPs ran ‘an orchestrated 
campaign of abuse’ against him after he attacked the party’s all-women 
shortlists, introduced to produce more female MPs.

Last
 night he said he had not been contacted by Labour about possible legal 
action, but had been told by  colleagues that Miss Yearley was ‘very 
upset’ about the claims.

After
 being told that his party was considering libel proceedings, Mr 
Mitchell said: ‘Are they? It seems impossible to me. They can’t be.’

However, the MP stood by his claims and said the conversations were witnessed by the party’s chief whip Rosie Winterton.

He
 said: ‘Of course it happened. Anna Yearley said Yorkshire and the North
 had been backward in selecting women, which struck me at the time as 
very odd as we’ve got a number of very able women such as Caroline Flint
 and Yvette Cooper, who are Yorkshire MPs.

‘I’m not saying she tore my eyes out and went for my genitals or anything like that. I wish she had. No, that was a joke.’

Austin Mitchell said Miss Yearley made the comment to him and also claimed she talked to him like 'an educationally subnormal pensioner'

Miss Yearley yesterday wrote on Twitter that the allegations were ‘totally untrue’.

She added: ‘I did not say the words attributed to me. I have denied it. I absolutely did not say that.’

Karen Buck, Mr Miliband’s Parliamentary Private Secretary, described the claims as a ‘deeply disturbing attack’.

And
 Jon Ashworth, deputy party chairman, added: ‘Labour wants to see more 
women in Commons. Shame Anna Yearley getting attacked again for that.’

Miss
 Yearley is one of the most powerful figures in the party leader’s 
office and acts as a link between Mr Miliband, MPs and the unions.

Earlier
 this year it was claimed she treated junior worker Gemma Tumelty 
poorly. Labour’s stakeholder relations manager, 33, quit with a pay-off 
after complaining about her treatment. Miss Yearley denied any 
wrongdoing.

She
 was also blamed after Mr Miliband posed with a copy of The Sun in 
Liverpool – where the paper is boycotted by some over its Hillsborough 
coverage.
