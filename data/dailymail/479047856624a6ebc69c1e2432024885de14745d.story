TV presenter Melanie Sykes is engaged to her toyboy lover Jack Cockings after a three month romance.

The divorced mother-of-two, 42, announced her engagement to the 26-year-old roofer on her Twitter page today.

The couple exchanged flirty messages on the micro-blogging site in April, before she finally agreed to an actual date in May.

Excitement: Melanie announced the news on her Twitter page

She wrote on her Twitter page today: 'To
my beautiful twitter friends just want to let you know that me 
& Jack @bespokespartan are engaged to be married and we are very 
giddy xxx.'

Half an hour later, she added: 'Your messages of congratulations have made me cry in a gorgeous lovely way. Thank you so much peeps. I love you xxxxx.'

Jack, who grew up in Dorset, owns his own roofing contracting company and has a five-year-old son from a previous relationship.

Her new romance hit the headlines after just a few weeks of dating when they exchanged saucy public messages on Twitter.

In one of the racy posts Melanie 
tweeted that she had 'the giddiest knickers of my life' and told Jack: 
'I've got the raging horn, please take me'.

In another, smitten Melanie wrote: 'Jack the rabbit I need some bunny love so hop to it!! Xxx boing boing!!! Loooooool xxxxxxx'.

He replied: 'Only if I can bounce into your face! Xxx', to which she asked: 'Will you fill mine? Xxx'.

Their messages caused an uproar, but Melanie recently insisted she didn't mind them to be public.

She
told the Daily Mail: 'I don’t even consider the people who follow me on
Twitter as fans. They’re friends, my community. It was just giddiness, 
banter; silly fun.

'Nothing
rude was actually happening, we were in different counties at the time.
And I didn’t mean to offend anyone because I’m not an offensive girl. 
I’m nice! If I did upset anyone, I’m really sorry. I just got a bit 
carried away.'

She also insisted she wasn't bothered by their 15 year age gap.

She told the Mail: 'I’m extremely happy, and vice versa.

'Some older men find my independence threatening. Younger men don’t. It’s a generational thing. It’s quite a big ask for a man to be with someone as insanely independent as me, and younger men have the confidence.

'My ex-husband was two years younger than me. I’ve always gone out with younger men. They’re more fun and love to have a laugh.’

In 2009, Sykes was granted a quickie divorce from actor husband Daniel Caltagirone due to his 'unreasonable behaviour'.

Sykes and Caltigirone split in 2008 after eight years of marriage and two sons Roman, 10, and Luca, eight.

In papers released to the public
after the divorce hearing, Sykes claimed she had been left 
'distressed' by her husband's failure to understand their financial 
troubles.

Prior to Jack, she also dated James Abram, an associate producer on The Paul O'Grady Show.

In 90s, she also dated Bros star Matt Goss and actor Max Beesley.
