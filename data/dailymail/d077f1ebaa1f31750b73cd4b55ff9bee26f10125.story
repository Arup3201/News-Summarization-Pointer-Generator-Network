Homeowners in Clinton, Massachusetts managed to capture the shocking moment a hot air balloon downed power lines in their neighbourhood.

The video begins with the balloon gliding dangerously close to the ground, looking as though it was aiming to land on a house roof.

Locals reported that people on board were waving and taking photos, before the balloon crashed straight into power lines.

The shocking video shows how panic descends among people on the street as sparks fly and two separate explosions occur.

‘They’re going to hit those lines,’ videographer Jose Papaleo's voice off-screen is heard saying as he films the ordeal from a car park across the street.

'They're going to land on top of this guy’s house right here,' Papaleo adds seconds later.

The cameraman immediately drops the camera as an explosion is heard and a flash of white light is seen.

Once he regains his composure, the footage shows the balloon seemingly on fire, emitting a thick, black smoke. 

Unfortunately, the balloon got caught and caused a massive explosion nearby to neighbourhood homes

‘What the f***?’ an off-screen observer yells.

A police car immediately races to the scene, but not before another explosion erupts from the balloon caught in the downed lines. 

Locals reported injuries at the scene with some passengers suffering from burns. Others reported a car which was also damaged in the blast.

The Federal Aviation Administration has since opened an investigation into the crash, which took place on a residential street.
