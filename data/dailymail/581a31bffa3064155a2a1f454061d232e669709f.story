An 87-year-old Denver man has been charged with cultivating more than 400 marijuana plants in his backyard, igniting a Facebook protest in his defence.

Edward Bogunovich initially denied the charges, telling ABC News, 'I didn't even have a pipe. I've got zero plants, and I have papers to prove it,' but later changed his tune to say he had sold the plants the day before police raided his home.

In that second, Monday afternoon interview, Bogunovich told ABC he had a notarized document proving the timely sale of the some 414 marijuana plants.

Meanwhile, Denver Police Det. Christopher 
Shotts said Bogunovich presented police with a 'questionable' state medical marijuana license after the Friday raid.

Those documents, Shotts wrote in an affidavit obtained by ABC News, provided for the legal growth of 231 marijuana plants between Bogunovich and two others cultivators, who 
also happened to be growing plants in his backyard.

Bogunovich was growing 183 more plants 
than he was allowed, Shotts said in the affidavit. Police seized the 
plants, which weighed a combined 461 pounds.

ABC News reported the Denver District Attorney’s Office said Bogunovich is charged with cultivating marijuana in excess of 30 plants, and possessing more than 12 ounces of marijuana with intent to distribute more than 100 pounds of marijuana.

 'I didn't even have a pipe. I've got zero plants, and I have papers to prove it.'

The arrest sparked a protest on ABC News's Facebook page after the organization prominently displayed its story on Bogunovich, there.

By Monday evening, nearly 700 people had 'liked' the story, with another 430 more posting comments, the vast majority defending Bogunvich and his actions.

'Leave grandpa alone,' wrote Lopez Borrero Minerva. 'He can't feed himself on a fixed income.

'Leave grandpa alone. He can't feed himself on a fixed income. Things keep going up in price but 
that SS check or VA check isn't going up.'

'Things keep going up in price but that SS check or VA check isn't going up. How is he suppose to eat and paid for his medications? Go get the murders, thieves, rapist, and child molesters that are out there.'

'Let that man keep his weed!' declared Tiffany Beatty, while another poster commented, 'Leave him alone! He's 87 years old, He probley needs it! Medical Marijuana right.'

Bogunovich was released from the Denver Detention Center in lieu of a $10,000 bond and is due back in court Thursday, ABC’s Denver affiliate KMGH reported.

Protest ignited: Close to a 1,000 people had 'liked' or commented on the ABC News' story on Bogunovich on Facebook by Monday evening
