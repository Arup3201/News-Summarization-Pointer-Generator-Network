The father of the 13-year-old girl attacked by a shark while going for a surf at a Central Coast beach this morning has joked he wishes his sons were as tough as his daughter. 

Teenager and sponsored Rip Curl surfer Kirra-Belle Olsson was bitten by the shark while going for a morning surf at Avoca Beach around 6:30am. 

Dad Jamie Olsson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘She thought it was one of her mates pulling her underwater and she started yelling out for help and it let her go.'

Kirra, from nearby Copacabana Beach, suffered injuries to her lower calf muscle, as well as puncture wounds to her foot.

Her mates and a professional photographer were on the beach when the attack occurred. Kirra was treated by bystanders and whisked to Gosford Hospital.

The proud dad explained that Kirra is in ‘good spirits’ and the shark missed any vital ligaments.

‘She’s got the Aussie titles coming up in November so will be back in the water by then,’ he said.

This photo shows the dramatic moment Kirra was carried off the beach by her father's friend Matt Stienweid and rushed to hospital 

Kirra posted a photo of herself being treated in hospital on Instagram, telling her friends 'I got attacked by a shark'

Kirra was wearing her Rip Curl wetsuit when she was bitten, which Mr Olsson thinks helped her.

‘She has been surfing since she was seven… she has won the state title two years in a row,’ he added.

‘It has not fazed her at all, she’s a nutcase... She only just got over a surfing injury on her leg. 

'I just wish my sons were as tough as her.. We've got two boys.' 

Surfing runs in the family for Kirra, who is the niece of pro surfer Matt Wilkinson.

‘She is pretty tough and she thought it was pretty funny, she popped up and said "I just got attacked by a shark",' Kirra's father said

Mr Olsson has been told Kirra could stay in hospital overnight because she has some ‘pretty decent gashes’.

Fisheries workers are trying to identify which shark launched the attack. 

Friends of the surfer posted messages on her Facebook wall wishing her well.

'Sending bundles of love you brave girl!' one wrote. 'Wishing you a speedy recovery.'

'Oh my god hope your okay Kirraa you beautiful thing!! Xxxxx' said another. 

The attacked occurred in the middle of the popular beach, near the channel. 

Gosford City Council beach superintendent Craig Healey told Daily Mail Australia a large school of fish had been seen off the beach and a seal had been seen gobbling them up.

'The fisheries guy and I believe it's definitely a shark that hit her (though), seal injuries are completely different.'  

Lifesavers are patrolling the beach on jetskis and are advising people to avoid entering the water. There has been no sign of the shark since the attack.

Avoca Beach and North Avoca Beach are closed for the day.

Mr Olsson said the attack has not put Kirra off going in the water.

‘She is pretty tough and she thought it was pretty funny, she popped up and said “I just got attacked by a shark”.

‘I don’t think she’s afraid of anything.’
