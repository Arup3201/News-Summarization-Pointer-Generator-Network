Britain could become a ‘second-class’ member of the European Union under plans floated in Brussels yesterday.

An influential group of European federalists, who want to see Brussels given even greater powers, is suggesting the UK is relegated to ‘associate member’ status.

The move would see Britain remain part of the single market but freed from much of the social legislation and bureaucracy associated with full EU membership.

However the UK would lose its veto on
 EU policy and would no longer have an EU commissioner or British 
representation in the European Parliament.

Downing Street was cool on the idea 
yesterday, saying that although David Cameron wanted a new relationship 
with the EU, based on membership of the single market, he was wary of 
adopting the same position as Norway – which although not a full EU 
member, as a major trading partner is obliged to adopt many of its 
regulations.

Critics condemn the position as being ‘ruled by fax’ from Brussels.

But some Eurosceptic Tories welcomed 
the suggestion, arguing that it was the first sign that federalist 
politicians were starting to take seriously the debate in the UK over 
the ever-increasing loss of sovereignty to Brussels.

Former Tory Cabinet minister John 
Redwood hailed the idea as ‘great news’, adding: ‘It shows that the UK 
can negotiate a new relationship with them.

'It shows that many on the Continent 
now recognise that the UK cannot join their euro union and needs a 
looser relationship with them based on trade.’

But fellow Tory Mark Pritchard said 
the proposal did not go far enough. ‘The UK should be free to trade with
 Europe but not shackled by the strictures and regulations of the single
 market,’ he said.

The Union of European Federalists is expected to set out its plan for Britain in a draft EU treaty in the spring.

British Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff, who 
heads the group, said the proposal would create a new category of 
membership to ensure Britain did not leave altogether.

‘If David Cameron proposes a 
catalogue of opt-outs, derogations, red lines and rebates for Britain to
 pick and choose, then he will strengthen the argument for the creation 
of a formal association for the UK,’ he said.

‘The priority on the Continent is to 
create a federal system which works, and Britain is seen at present as a
 continual impediment.’
