Neglect: Mahroof, pictured with the seven-month-old she abandoned daily, left her while on the school run, which the judge compared to the PM accidentally leaving his daughter Nancy in a pub a few months ago.

A neglectful mother has been spared jail after a judge compared her child-rearing abilities to those of David Cameron.

Aysiea Mahroof, 27, appeared in the dock after regularly leaving  her seven-month-old daughter home alone.

She wept in court as she admitted child neglect, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years.

However, Judge Vivian Manning-Davies gave her a community order instead.

In doing so, he referred to the recent revelation that Mr Cameron and his wife drove off without their eight-year-old daughter Nancy after a Sunday pub lunch.

Mahroof, who routinely left her youngest alone for an hour every day while she took her two older children to and from school, admitted a charge of neglect but claimed she did not know she had done anything illegal.

Judge Manning-Davies sympathised, telling her: ‘A parent makes mistakes in relation to children.

‘I include myself in that statement. Recently, by way of an example, the Prime Minister left his own daughter in a pub.’

Mahroof’s school run took 40 minutes in the morning, and 20 in the afternoon.

Her neighbours tipped off police after seeing her leave home every day without her baby.

When Mahroof was arrested, she pleaded with the officers: ‘If I  don’t do it again, can I go?’ She also told police she could not  manage to get the baby’s buggy down the steps outside her house in Swansea.

In addition, she claimed she received no childcare help from her family because they had shunned her after she refused an arranged marriage.

Abandoned: The child was left here for 40 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon because she couldn't get the buggy up and down the steps

Judge Manning-Davies gave Mahroof a 
community order with 12 months’ supervision, saying her only motive was 
to take her children to school. ‘What this case is not, like so many in 
court, is that you left children for only self-interest,’ he said.

‘In that situation, I would be  sentencing you to a term of imprisonment.

‘But this is not a case of you being an uncaring mother – quite the contrary.’

Mahroof said after the case that she had not realised leaving her baby alone was illegal.

‘When I took my two children to school my heart was pounding.

‘But I thought I was keeping  her 
safe,’ she explained. ‘No  mother wants their child harmed but I didn’t 
realise it was the law not to leave them. I will never ever do that 
again.

‘I want to thank the judge for understanding my feelings and what I am going through.’

Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him

Error: The Plough pub, where the Camerons accidentally left their daughter Nancy when they drove off in separate cars, which the judge compared to Mahroof acts of neglect

The details of the Camerons’  accident
emerged last month, weeks after the Prime Minister was widely ridiculed
after a biography claimed he liked to ‘chillax’ at Chequers on 
weekends.

After the Sunday lunch in question, 
the Prime Minister was  driven back to Chequers with his police 
protection officers in one car while his wife Samantha drove children 
Arthur, six, and Florence, one, home.

Nancy had popped in to the toilet 
without telling her parents as  they left and each of her parents 
thought she was in the other car.

A spokesman for Mr Cameron said he was
‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened, and confirmed that Mrs
Cameron  had returned to pick up Nancy as soon as they discovered she  
was missing.

She was found safe and well at the Plough Inn in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, and taken home.
