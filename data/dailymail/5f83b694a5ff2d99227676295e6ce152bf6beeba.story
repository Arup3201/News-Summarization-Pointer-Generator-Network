Blackburn forward Joshua King scored twice as Norway completed a comfortable 3-0 Euro 2016 Group H win away to Malta.

Norway had been beaten 2-0 at home by Italy in their opening qualifier, but were soon in control at the Ta'Qali national stadium.

After a positive opening when goalkeeper Andrew Hogg was called into action more than once, the visitors took the lead on 21 minutes when Cardiff teenager Mats Moller Daehli converted a low cross from King.

The Blackburn forward made it 2-0 soon after when he sprinted into the left side of the Malta penalty area before slotting home.

Malta, who lost 2-0 against Croatia in their first qualifier, tried to mount a fightback as Clayton Failla and Michael Mifsud both tested Norway goalkeeper Orjan Haskjold.

There was, though, to be no recovery as King headed in a third goal at the start of the second half from a deep cross by captain Per Ciljan Skjelbred.

Hogg denied King his hat-trick with a couple of good saves before the striker went off during the closing stages as Norway made a couple of changes - but left 15-year-old Stromsgodset winger Martin Odegaard on the bench as an unused substitute and still awaiting his competitive debut.
