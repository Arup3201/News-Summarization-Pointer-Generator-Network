The ex-boyfriend of a Maui woman who was five months pregnant when she disappeared in February has been indicted on charges of killing her and torching her SUV to cover up the crime.

Steven Capobianco of Maui is expected to be served with an arrest warrant on Monday at Maui Community Correctional Center, where he has been held since last month in an unrelated case.

A Maui grand jury on Friday indicted Capobianco on a second-degree murder charge in the death of 27-year-old Carly Scott, who has never been found.

Capobianco is the father of Scott's unborn child and has adamantly denied hurting her.

Family members last saw Scott in February at her sister's Haiku home. The Makawao woman's burned 1997 Toyota 4Runner was later found on the island's north shore.

Capobianco also was indicted on an arson charge.

Before the vehicle was located, police found Scott's dog in the nearby community of Nahiku. Police later began investigating her disappearance as a homicide.

Capobianco has told Hawaii News Now he saw Scott on the night that her family says she vanished, but had nothing to do with her disappearance.

He said Scott picked him up and drove him to his pickup truck, which had broken down in Keanae.

He said that after he fixed his truck, Scott was driving behind him, but he lost sight of her and figured she arrived safely at her destination.

When Capobianco was asked if Scott had any ememies, he replied: 'That's hard for me to say. I didn't hang 
out with her very often. But, I mean, she had kind of a mouth on her - I
 could see her pissing somebody off.'

Capobianco couldn't be reached for comment on Monday at the jail, where he's being held on $500,000 bail on charges including terroristic threatening and prohibited deadly weapons.

Prosecutors are expected to seek $2 million bail for the murder case.
