Masterchef Australia made international headlines for all the wrong reasons this week, causing outrage after it displayed the Indian flag upside down.

On Tuesday's episode of the cooking show, which is incredibly popular in India, contestants had to prepare dishes from different national cuisines.

But when the Indian flag was revealed from underneath a silver dish-cover the flag was upside down, with the saffron segment at the bottom and the green at the top.

Indian viewers complained about the gaffe on social media, with Hrishikesh Thite writing: '@masterchefau put the India flag upside down! Is that how it is down under?'

Lalit Tankala wrote: '#masterchefaustralia Has India flag upside down. Wow!! Didn't expect this from u guys!!'

'The India flag on @masterchefau was placed upside down. Homework not done!' wrote Sydney-based viewer Sathwick.

The flag, known as the tricolour, was officially adopted in the country in 1947 and features three horizontal bands, with the saffron band always at the top.

Masterchef Australia is one of the most popular shows on Indian television. Its success prompted the creation of a local version, Masterchef India, in 2010.

'Masterchef Australia is one of the top programmes being watched in India at the moment and as such you would have thought there would have been some research being done and some due diligence,' Dipen Rughani, chairman of the Australia India Business Council, told Daily Mail Australia.

'I imagine it probably wouldn't go down well with Indians,' he said.

'I don't think it was done deliberately. I don't think there should be a big uproar about it.

'But our government makes sure the Australian anthem is played correctly and the Australian flag is displayed instead of the New Zealand flag, I think we need to be a little bit more diligent.'

A SHINE Australia spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'an unintentional oversight during production. We unreservedly apologise for any offence caused.'

The incident followed a similar gaffe in June, when the official video of the Commonwealth Games posted to social media showed the Indian flag upside down.

The Indian flag was also shown upside down in an official video promoting the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, distributed in June
