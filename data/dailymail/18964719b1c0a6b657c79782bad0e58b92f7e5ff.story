Fernando Torres was in the stands at the Vicente Calderon as Antoine Griezmann scored twice for Atletico Madrid in a comfortable win against Levante.

The returning hero watched on as Diego Simeone's defending champions pulled to within a single point of league leaders Real Madrid on Saturday. 

Griezmann, who netted a hat-trick in his last outing before La Liga's winter break, opened the scoring in the 18th-minute, before nodding in again after half time.

Former Liverpool midfielder Nabil El Zhar pulled one back for Levante just beyond the hour mark, but Diego Godin secured the result for Atletico with a third eight minutes from time.

Attention before kick off was all on Torres, who could make his second debut for the club on Wednesday when Atletico host Real on Wednesday in the Copa del Rey, but as soon as the game started it was all about France forward Griezmann.

The 23-year-old was first to reach Guilherme Siqueira's cross  to turn it past goalkeeper Diego Marino in the first half, before nodding in a rebound after Marino had stretched to save Mario Mandzukic's initial effort in the 47th-minute.

El Zhar then netted for Levante, before Godin put the game beyond doubt, before enthusing about Torres' return to Atletico - who face Barcelona next weekend after Real in midweek.

'Fernando is a player from this house that creates a lot of excitement," said Godin. 'He has come to do his part and you can see he wants to do well.

'This (win) will help us face a hard week of important matches.'
