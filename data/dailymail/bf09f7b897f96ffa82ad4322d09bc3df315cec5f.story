Forest Boy: Ray, who wandered into Berlin after five years of 'living in the woods'

This is the first picture of 'Forest Boy' - the English speaking teenager who last September wandered into the city of Berlin saying he had been living for five years in the wilderness with his father.

Unable to identify the boy since he emerged in the German capital, Berlin police have issued his picture in a bid to jog people's memory and maybe throw up some leads.

Police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said: 'We've checked his DNA against all missing person reports, sent the data to Interpol so they could check it internationally, but unfortunately without any success.'

The boy said his father called him 'Ray' and that he was born June 20, 1994, but claims not to know his last name or where he is from.

He said his mother, Doreen, died in a car accident when he was 12 and after that he and his father, Ryan, took to the forest.

They wandered using maps and a compass, staying in tents or caves overnight, he added.

And he told authorities that after his father died in August 2011, he buried him in the forest and then walked five days north before ending up in Berlin, and showed up at city hall.

Investigators have been unable to confirm any details about a fatal car accident that matches up with Ray's story, however, and haven't been able to find the body of the father - raising 'serious doubts' about the story.

'There are many question marks,' Neuendorf added.

He
is now being taken care of by youth services, and is going to school. 
When he first appeared, Ray spoke English and a few words of German, but
has picked up more German fast, Neuendorf said.

He has also quickly adapted to city life and technology, using a laptop and his cell phone with no problems.

'Everything gives the impression that he was not far away from civilization for years,' Neuendorf said.

Neuendorf said that Ray does not speak 
English with a particular accent, leading investigators to believe that 
he is not a native speaker.

Possessions: Ray's rucksack, which was on him when he was found

There are no indications, however, of what his native tongue might be.Â  Ray is described as being somewhere between 16-20 years old and 180cm (about 5ft 11in) tall.

He has dark blonde hair and blue eyes, and three small scars on his forehead, three small scars on his chin and a small scar on his right arm.

He has a complete set of teeth and no obvious dental work, and his hands, fingernails and teeth appear 'well kept'.

Police in Berlin have asked anyone with information on him to contact them.
