Britain is set to enjoy a mini spring heatwave this week, but make the most of it as the mercury is set to drop by the weekend.

Met Office forecasters predict temperatures could climb to 13C by the middle of the week, higher than the average for this time of year.

But they warned the UK won't be basking in bright sunshine for long as the higher temperatures will bring more rain later in the week.

Fire and ice: A gamekeeper checks the flames as heather is kept young and tidy by controlled burning carried out between September and April every year, on the Invercauld Estate near Braemar, Aberdeenshire

On fire: The annual burning, or 'swiping' is usually carried out when the heather starts to dry but the peat is still wet - but the keeper had to contend with unusual weather conditions - there was still snow on the highlands

While much of the UK has begun to enjoy 
the spring-like weather, one moor keeper braved bleak temperatures, snow
and ice to tend to his heather.

Dramatic pictures show the keeper, on the Invercauld Estate, near Braemar, Aberdeenshire, burning the heather to keep it young and healthy.

The annual practice, known as swiping, is normally carried out when the weather starts to improve and the heather is dry while the peat is wet.

But with freezing temperatures of late, and snow and ice still on the ground in the highlands, the keeper was forced to mix fire and ice, burning his heather in difficult weather conditions.

Healthy: Heather burning is a traditional management tool which if carried out can regenerate healthier and benefit livestock and wildlife

The burning plays an important role in 
the rural economy, bringing birds together to feed on newly cropped 
areas and sustaining the grouse shooting season.

Elsewhere, though, temperatures crept up to just below 
13C in places yesterday with temperatures set to stick around at the 
level for much of the week.

But
despite warmer temperatures during the day, parts of the UK endured a 
freezing start yesterday morning, with temperatures dropping below zero and 
many places waking to a ground frost.

The gallops at Newbury Racecourse in Berkshire were cancelled yesterday as the ground was frozen this morning.

Despite a cold start, spring looked set to be on its way, with newborn lambs pictured in Durham yesterday.

A Met office forecaster said this week's warmer temperatures are not unusual for this time of year.

She said: 'It is certainly not unusual for this time of year, it will just be a welcome change after the last couple of weeks which have been below average.'

Today was expected to be slightly cooler than yesterday in the north of the UK, but temperatures will still reach 9C or 10C around London.

Tuesday will see temperatures rise again to 12C or 13C, with the rest of the week carrying on in a similar vein.

The Met Office spokesman added: 'It's possibly becoming a little bit cooler for the weekend. The other thing that you will notice is there is going to be a bit more rain appearing.

'Today, Monday and Tuesday, it is looking mostly dry across the majority of the country with varying amounts of cloud and sunshine depending where you are.

'From Wednesday, rain will start appearing, firstly from south-west Britain then moving across the rest of the country.

'By the end of Wednesday a lot of places will have some but it's not going to be particularly heavy, more cloudy and breezy with a bit of rain.

'Wednesday and Thursday look similar and beyond that it's looking like continued unsettled weather. There will be some rain at time in most places, generally fairly cloudy and quite breezy often.'
