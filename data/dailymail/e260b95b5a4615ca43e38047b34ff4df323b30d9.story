Two star: Elaine West, who joined the RAF aged 17, has been promoted to air vice-marshal

A woman who joined the RAF straight from school at 17 has made history by becoming the first female two-star officer in Britain’s Armed Forces.

Elaine West, 51, has been promoted to air vice-marshal – the highest military rank ever held by a woman in the UK.

She has been appointed a director at the Defence Infrastructure Organisation and will oversee multimillion-pound military infrastructure projects and schemes to improve defence capability, and manage the withdrawal of army units from Germany.

Air Vice-Marshal West, who is married with a teenage son, joined the RAF in the lowest rank of aircraftwoman in 1978.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said her promotion showed there were no ‘glass ceilings’ for female officers.

He said: 'We need the best and the brightest talent in senior positions as we transform defence over the next few years as we build Future Force 2020 and that means selecting people from across defence, irrespective of gender.

'I am pleased that we are demonstrating in defence that there are no "glass ceilings" for female officers who have the necessary abilities to rise to the senior ranks.'

Air Vice-Marshal West joined the RAF in late 1978 in the lowest rank as an aircraftwoman.

She has worked in more than 18 roles and served in bases across the world.

She said: 'It is with enormous pride that I take up my new appointment as Director of Projects and Programme Delivery within the Defence Infrastructure Organisation.

'I am privileged to have served in the RAF and to have enjoyed so many challenging roles over the years.

'To now be the first female military two-star is a truly unexpected bonus.

Inspiration: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said Elaine West's success proved there was 'no glass ceiling' for women in the Armed Forces

'I know so many inspirational women across all three services who continue to make a substantial contribution to operations and our armed forces more widely.

'This is a terrific opportunity and one that I’m looking forward to immensely.'

Before Air Vice-Marshal West’s promotion, the highest rank held by a regular serving female officer in the modern-day RAF was Air Commodore - a one-star post.

In predecessor organisations, the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and Women’s Royal Air Force (WRAF), there had been a two star rank of Air Chief Commandant.

The highest ranking female officer in the navy has been Commodore and the highest rank achieved by a woman in the army has been Brigadier, the MoD said.

Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford said: 'Elaine West’s promotion to the rank of Air Vice-Marshal is thoroughly well deserved and I wish her every success in her challenging role within the Defence Infrastructure Organisation.

'The Royal Air Force is proud of its record as an equal opportunities employer, we were recognised most recently by the Times as one of the UK’s top 50 female employers, and it is fantastic to see more female officers reaching top positions within the service.

'The vast majority of roles in the armed forces are open to women and I would encourage everyone, regardless of gender to take full advantage of the opportunities available to them within the military.'
