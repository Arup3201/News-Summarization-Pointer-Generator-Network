With less than a week to go until Prince George's first birthday, bookmakers have suspended betting on a royal pregnancy announcement this month after a flurry of bets were placed overnight.

The bets, which were placed with bookmakers Coral, were made online and in quick succession - enough, said a spokesman for the betting firm, to set alarm bells ringing.

Prior to the unusual activity, Coral had been offering odds of 10/1 on the Duchess of Cambridge announcing a second pregnancy in July but slashed the odds to even money before pulling the plug entirely.

'With Prince Georgeâ€™s first birthday 
just around the corner, the latest gamble strongly indicates that he 
could soon be joined by a little brother or sister,' commented Coral's Nicola McGeady.

'In fact, there could
 even be double celebrations in the Windsor household next Tuesday.'

Ladbrokes has also suspended betting on a July pregnancy announcement after slashing odds from 8/11 to 4/1 overnight.

Kensington Palace, which has not confirmed any of the rumours or speculation, refused to comment when approached by MailOnline.

The latest news comes in the wake of a blizzard of speculative reports in the foreign press, many of which claim to have proof that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting again.

Most prominent was a report in 
Australian magazine New Idea, which alleged that a friend of the Duchess 
has confirmed the pregnancy rumours.

Jessica Hay, who confirmed the Duchess 
of Cambridge's first pregnancy in November 2012, is said to have told 
the tabloid that the Duchess is expecting with an announcement to follow
 'within months'.

'Kate's inner circle are buzzing with the news that she is pregnant,' said Hay, according to the Australian magazine.

'I've heard it from several different friends of theirs now and they're saying that they think there's going to be an official announcement in weeks.'

Hay, who attended Marlborough College with the Duchess, added, 'Kate's face is fuller like it was when she was first expecting George and she's been changing her hair, which could be to disguise the fullness.

'She has rosy cheeks, she's letting her greys show again, and whenever she's out in public she goes to great lengths to hold something over her tummy.'

Bookmakers might have suspended betting on a possible pregnancy announcement this month but that hasn't stopped punters from placing bets on the name of Prince George's future brother or sister.

The current favourites, according to Ladbrokes, are Victoria and James on 6/1, with Alexandra and Elizabeth tied on second place with odds of 8/1.

Also popular are Thomas on 10/1, Mary and Diana on 12/1 and Alice on 16/1. Charles, Charlotte, Frances and Phillip are also heavily backed.

Least popular are Louis, Richard and Peter - currently lagging at the back of the royal baby name stakes on 25/1.
