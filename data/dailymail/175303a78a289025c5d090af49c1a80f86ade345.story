For men who do not yet want children but hate condoms, or for those that can’t face a vasectomy, there may soon be a new option when it comes to contraception.

Scientists are working on a substance called Vasalgel – an injectable ‘barrier’ that seals the small tube that carries sperm, called the vas deferens.

The gel works like a filter to stop the passage of sperm while allowing other fluids through, but unlike a vasectomy, it is easily reversible.

Scientists are working on a substance called Vasalgel – an injectable ‘barrier’ that seals the small tube that carries sperm, called the vas deferens, as a new alternative form of contraception

It is being developed at the Parsemus Foundation, based in San Francisco.

The long-acting, non-hormonal contraceptive would require a procedure similar to a non-scalpel vasectomy, where gel is inserted in the vas deferens, rather than cutting the vas, as done in a vasectomy.

‘If a man wishes to restore flow of sperm, whether after months or years, the polymer is flushed out of the vas with another injection,’ the company says.

It is intended as an alternative to a vasectomy, as opposed to a replacement for condoms, because it would not protect men against sexually transmitted infections.

While it is not yet ready for humans, animal trials in rabbits and baboons have proved that it’s effective, and that a second injection dissolved the barrier, enabling animals to regain their fertility.

Elaine Lissner, director of the Parsemus Foundation, told Yahoo that Vasalgel is similar to, and as effective as the female IUD - an intrauterine device better known as the 'coil' that's inserted into a woman's uterus - for preventing pregnancy. 

‘So far, it’s even a little better,’ she said.

Vasalgel would be injected into a man's vas deferens - the tiny tube that carries sperm.

This would require a procedure similar to a non-scalpel vasectomy.

Once installed, it would work like a filter to stop the passage of sperm, while allowing other fluids through.

If a man wants to become fertile again, another injection would be required to dissolve the polymer gel.

The gel is intended as an alternative to a vasectomy and could be used in place of a condom, although it would not protect a man from STIs.

The science behind the gel has been tested in India for 20 years in the form of a polymer contraceptive called Risug, which is in advanced clinical trials.

Currently, only local men near the study sites in the country have tested it and reversibility studies have not yet been tried on humans.

The foundation bought the rights to produce a gel-barrier make contraceptive that could be sold in the West and have changed the formulation.

‘The goal is to have it on the market as an alternative to vasectomy as soon as possible, with the first clinical trial expected to begin in 2014,’ it says

The gel could mean that vasectomy’s may no longer be needed which can have complications and side effects, such as pain, infection and bleeding.

Male fertility expert, Dr Jamin Brahmbhatt, Co-Director of The Pur Clinic, welcomes a new contraception option for men, but is cautious because the injection site is so tiny. He fears that scarring from the injection of the barrier, could stop a reversal.

‘Since there’s no long-term data on this, there’s no guarantee about the effectiveness of a reversal,’ he said.
