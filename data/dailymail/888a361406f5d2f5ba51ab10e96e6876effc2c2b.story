The eye of the storm: Astronaut Alexander Gerst has captured stunning images of Supertyphoon Neoguri from the International Space Station.

The storm has sustained winds of 108mph per hour and gusts up to 154mph, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

Neoguri, which means 'raccoon dog' in Korean, was moving northward at 25 kilometers an hour (15 miles an hour) packing sustained winds of 126 kilometers an hour (78 miles an hours) by midday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

The German spaceman took the pictures between 7-8 July.

Describing one close-up image, he said: 'Scary. The sunlight is far from reaching down the abyss of Neoguri's 65 km-wide eye.'

The storm is so big it could not even be captured in a single imageÂ  using the astronauts fisheye lens on the ISS.

'Supertyphoon Neoguri did not even fit into our fisheye lens view. I have never seen anything like this,' said Gerst.

The powerful storm slammed through the southwestern Japanese island of Okinawa, leaving at least 28 people injured and 63,000 homes without power before swerving toward the bigger island of Kyushu on Wednesday.

The Okinawan government raised the injury toll to 28 from 17 the day before, two of them seriously. Separately, a man has already been reported missing from a fishing boat in rough seas off Kyushu to the north.

Typhoon Neoguri, one of the biggest storms to hit during Japan's summer, appeared to be headed toward Kyushu, where it could land Thursday. Then it could travel across the main island of Honshu.

Astronaut Alexander Gerst captioned this picture taken 7 July: 'Scary. The sunlight is far from reaching down the abyss of Neoguri's 65 km-wide eye.'

Typhoon Neoguri was reported heading for the Japanese mainland on Wednesday (9 July).   With gusts of up to 110 miles an hour (180km/h) the typhoon was forecast to hit the southern main island of Kyushu early Thursday before moving east along the Japanese archipelago, according to the national weather agency.
