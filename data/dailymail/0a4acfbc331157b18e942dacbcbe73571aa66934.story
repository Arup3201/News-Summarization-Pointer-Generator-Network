A woman who found an unusual money box in her mother-in-law's attic has sold it for more than £160,000 at auction.

The unidentified owner had been cleaning out the loft in Peebles, Scotland, when she discovered the antique 'Coasting Bank'.

The curious contraption, believed to be the only one in existence, features a painted baby resting atop a gold-painted cast steel slide - while straddling a coin slot. 

Unique: The 'Coasting Bank', discovered in a Scottish attic, has sold for more than £160,000 at an auction

Discovery: The antique toy, believed to be the only one in existence, was found in a loft in Peebles, Scotland

Curious: It features a painted baby resting atop a gold-painted cast steel slide - while straddling a coin slot

The unknowing woman had previously taken it along to a filming of BBC1's Antiques Roadshow - where specialists immediately suspected it might be valuable.

It then went on to cause an even bigger stir at an annual banquet of collectors in America.

Now, the money box has sold for $266,500 (£165,500) to a US bidder at an auction in Philadelphia - nearly nine times its estimated worth of between $30,000 (£18,630) and $50,000 (£31,038).

Lynda Cain, head of Americana at Freeman’s auction house, said: 'We were thrilled with the price the "Coasting Bank" achieved.

Unveiling: The 'Coasting Bank' has only been revealed to the general public once before in an advertisement in Ehrich's Fashion Quarterly dated 1884, pictured, where it was priced at 95 cents

Surprise: It has sold for £165,500 - nearly nine times its estimated worth of between £18,630 and £31,038

'It came to us in very good condition, and it caused quite a stir among collectors.'

Company
president Paul Roberts added: 'Most importantly, the owner of the bank 
was delighted with the outcome and said the final price achieved had "exceeded expectations".'

The antique toy bank - measuring less than 10 inches long, three inches wide and five-and-a-half inches high - had been missing for more than 100 years before surfacing in the Scottish attic.

Valuable: The antique bank is likely to have been made by famous toy designer Charles A Bailey

It is likely to have been made by famous toy designer 
Charles A Bailey while he was working for leading mechanical bank 
manufacturers J & E Stevens of Connecticut from the 1880s to about 1915.

Mr Bailey, who also created the rare Bismark Pig Bank and the Germania Exchange Bank, was known for his use of lead or white 
metal - materials that are believed to have been used for the 'Coasting Bank'.

Its general action and 
design also suggest this may have been the predecessor to the more 
widely known and highly prized ‘Shoot the Chute’ bank designed by Bailey
for Stevens Co in 1906.

The 'Coasting Bank' is infinitely more entertaining than your average piggy bank - with its slide held up by two poles stemming from its red painted base.

As the sled descends, the coin is deposited in a triangular cast lead bank, which is painted green with gold floral scrollwork.

The unusual contraption has only been unveiled to the general public 
once before in an advertisement in Ehrich’s Fashion Quarterly dated 1884 - where it was priced at 95 cents.

Decorative cast iron mechanical banks started being made in America around the 1870s and remained popular into the 1930s with children and adults alike.

Today, they are highly sought after collector’s items.

The full story of the Coasting Bank is due to feature in a Christmas edition of the Antiques Roadshow.
