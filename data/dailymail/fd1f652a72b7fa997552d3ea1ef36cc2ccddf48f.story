A group of passengers who were stranded aboard a Carnival cruise liner for five days last year as sewage ran along the hallways are suing for $5,000 a month for the rest of their lives.

The lawsuit brought by 33 passengers of the ill-fated Carnival Triumph voyage says they suffered mental anguish following the February 2013 ordeal and require the sum to cover medical bills.

Many claimed they suffer from PTSD, anxiety and depression, while others have physical ailments from the ordeal, including leg pain, diarrhea, respiratory problems and aggravated hemorrhoids.

The suit filed in Miami is the first to go to trial after the liner, which launched from Galveston, Texas, broke down in the Gulf of Mexico following an engine fire last year.

Trouble
 at sea: The Carnival Triumph, pictured in February 2013, became 
stranded in the Gulf of Mexico after an engine fire. Now 33 passengers 
are hoping to get $5,000 a month for injuries they suffered

The Triumph was left without engine power, air conditioning or working toilets. Passengers described scenes of human waste seeping 
into hallways, sleeping under makeshift tarps and no cooked food.

A federal judge in South Florida 
last week finished hearing three weeks of testimony from passengers and 
is expected to issue a judgment in the next two months.

The
 lawsuit is the first from the Triumph incident to go 
to trial, with others in preparation, according maritime lawyers.

Battle: Debra Oubre, one of the plaintiffs, said she has since experienced panic and anxiety attacks

Most of the passengers are seeking $5,000 in damages a year for the rest of their lives, claiming they will need medical monitoring because of the incident.

They have said they want the money in lump sums based on government predictions estimating their life expectancies.

One
 plaintiff, Debra Oubre, 59, from Friendswood, Texas, said she suffered a
 urinary tract infection due to the cruise and has since experienced 
panic and anxiety attacks.

'It was chaotic,' she told Reuters. 'People were in dire need of help. We were standing in line for food for five hours.'

But
 in a statement Carnival Corp said that while it knows it was an 
uncomfortable experience, families returned safely and were given a full
 refund, a free future cruise and an additional $500 per person.

'This
 is an opportunistic lawsuit brought by plaintiff's counsel and 
plaintiffs who seek to make a money grab,' a company spokeswoman said.

Carnival
 attorneys have asked Senior U.S. District Judge Donald Graham, who is 
hearing the case without a jury, to reject all of
 the damage claims, saying passengers haven't proved their health issues
 are linked to the cruise. Others have failed to show any health 
problems at all, they say.

Plea: The passengers in the lawsuit claim they were left with mental anguish and physical ailments

Passengers aboard the stricken cruise liner detailed the horrifying conditions.

Debra Rightmire, passenger: 'Toilets are overflowing in the cabins, we are having to sleep in the hallways. Onion and cucumber sandwiches last night. Cabin carpets are wet with urine.'

Gary Keyes, whose wife was on board: 'No power, no water, having to use the bathroom in bags.'

Brent Nutt, whose wife was on board: 'People are fighting over food and stuff - that's a bunch of savages.'

Blogger Clinty76 reporting on his wife's experience: 'We have no power AT ALL, which means we can't use the toilets, wash our hands, or take a shower'

Donna Gutzman, passenger: 'There's no lights, no water, we can't flush.'

Graham
 has already ruled that the engine fire is negligence on the part of 
Carnival, a significant blow for the cruise line, according to Robert 
Peltz, a Miami maritime lawyer.

'It
 would seem rather obvious that ships shouldn't just catch fire and then
 have fire suppression systems that don't work,' Peltz said.

Carnival has since started a fleet-wide 'enhancement', including a major
 re-wiring of its engine rooms and improvements to fire safety and 
emergency power features, Reuters reported.

The cruise line also said it would 
repay the U.S. government for the costs of responding to the stricken ship and another vessel, the Splendor.

This latest case could change how cruise lines insulate themselves from legal actions, according to maritime legal experts.

A
 second pending lawsuit with even more plaintiffs has the potential to 
further undo the advantageous legal position cruise lines have long 
enjoyed.

Cruise
 lines have successfully inoculated themselves against 
passenger lawsuits by printing stringent terms on tickets that 
require passengers to waive their right to a class-action lawsuit.

Relief: Passengers finally arrive in Mobile, Alabama last year after being stranded at sea for five days

The great escape: Passenger Kendall Jenkins kisses the ground after stepping off the cruise liner in Mobile, Alabama last year. Numerous lawsuits have been brought against Carnival in the aftermath of the ordeal

Graham's
 ruling, which is expected to come in the next two months, could find 
the terms of conditions printed on the tickets, so-called 'contracts of 
adhesion,' to be overreaching.

The contracts have rankled some 
federal judges in southern Florida where several cruise lines are based,
 according to maritime lawyer, David Neblett.

The myriad 
cruise cases for relatively meager sums clogs their calendars, he said.

One
 term of the ticket contract is that passengers can only bring their 
cases to the Southern District of Florida and lawyers 
complain that people coming from other states to litigate is too costly 
for them.
