One is reported dead and 73 confirmed injured after an explosion at a Louisiana chemical plant started a massive blaze.

Louisiana State Police say there was an explosion at a plant in the town of Geismar and footage showed thick, black smoke pouring from a huge fire at the facility.

The fire broke out Thursday morning around 8:30am at the Williams Olefins plant about 20 miles from Louisiana capital Baton Rouge.

Explosion: A fire started by an explosion broke out at a Louisiana chemical plant Thursday morning and injured 64, some critically. One was reported dead

Louisiana's health department said 73 people were treated at hospitals for injuries ranging from minor to critical following the explosion.

The cause is not yet known, but witnesses told WVLA that a fireball rose 300 feet into the air and the ground shook at neighboring plants.

In a press conference, State police Capt. Doug Cain confirmed one victim was pulled from the facility dead.

Several burn victims were treated at the scene and at a triage unit set up at nearby Iberville High School.

The company said the blast happened at 8:37 a.m. at the plant in an industrial area of Geismar, a Mississippi River community about 20 miles southeast of Baton Rouge.

By 10:30am, police had blocked off area surface roads and highways.

Victims: Officials said at least injured at the petrochemical plant explosion at 8:30 Thursday morning. The fire was out by 11am

Cain said all of the plant's more than 300 workers had been accounted for by Thursday afternoon.

At a roadblock several miles away from 
the plant, where family members waited anxiously to hear about loved 
ones, flames were easily visible above the trees.

The fire is now fully contained, though fire can still be seen rising from the plant's tall smokestacks, which WVLA described as a 'slow burn' of remaining chemicals.

Remnants: Smoke poured from the Williams Olefins plant after the initial fire was contained in what was called a 'controlled burn.'

'The chemicals are burning off,' J.B. Slaton, Louisiana State Police, said. 'They’re not leaving a compound, they’re not going into the air, they’re burning off.'

Early tests did not indicate 
dangerous levels of any chemicals around the plant, according to DEQ 
spokesperson Jean Kelly, who called the blaze an 'ethylene fire.'

However, a hazmat team was reportedly
on the scene to decontaminate the area and nearby residents were told 
to remain indoors with doors and windows closed.

A contract worker, Daniel Cuthbertson, 34, described a scene of "mass hysteria" immediately after the explosion, with workers scrambling over gates to get out of the plant.

'God was with me today because I know when I looked back, I barely made it. I know somebody was hurt. There's no way everybody escaped that,' said Cuthbertson, who was interviewed at an emergency staging area about 2 miles from the plant.

State Sen. Troy Brown said the ground shook at his house, several miles from the plant.

'It felt like a three-second earthquake. It was a massive explosion,' Brown said.

He drove to a nearby gas station and saw flames 100 to 200 feet high.

'It was scary,' he said.

Workers at the nearby plants were told to shelter in place after the blast, an order that was later lifted.

The company's website says the plant puts out about 1.3 billion pounds of ethylene and 90 million pounds of polymer grade propylene a year.

The plant makes highly flammable gases that are basic building blocks in the petrochemical industry.
