An uninhabited Outer Hebridean island that was home to both Bonnie Prince Charlie and Hercules the bear has been sold for over Â£500,000.

Estate agents confirmed that an offer above the asking price has been accepted for Wiay, which lies off the coast of South Uist. The deal is expected to be concluded this week.

A number of overseas bidders were also interested, but it has been sold to an un-named Scot.

The 970-acre island of Wiay: It has been uninhabited for over a century

The
island boasts the cave in which Bonnie Prince Charlie, the leader of 
the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, concealed himself for several days while 
being sought by British government forces.

It was also a brief home for Hercules the bear who famously went missing on Benbecula in 1980 while filming a TV advert.

The
island has been uninhabited for over a century, although the current 
owners - the Chettle family from England, who bought it in 2003 - used 
it for holidays and summer camping. But the new owners will not have to 
make do with life underground or under canvas.

A
ruined croft, which was once home to ten islanders, was recently given 
planning permission for a new home that will provide spectacular views 
of the island's surroundings.

The hideout used by Bonnie Prince Charlie following the Battle of Culloden in 1745 was put up for sale earlier this month

Western
Isles Councillors approved the renovation into a two bedroom lodge 
despite the recommendation for refusal by planning officers.

Archie Melville of selling agents Bell Ingram, said: 'We had a lot of interest - including from overseas.

"It
total we had about half-a-dozen serious parties and an offer in excess 
of the asking price has been accepted. We expect the deal to be 
concluded this coming week - certainly before Christmas.

'The new owner is a Scot with roots in the area. He knows what owning an island in Scotland involves - and it is not a whim.

The island also has sporting rights, and in recent years the land has been used for woodcock and duck shooting. There is also red deer stalking and fishing

'An
area of land with as much history and beauty as the Island of Wiay does
not come up on the market very often.

'It has a fantastic back story, 
once being the hidey-hole for Bonnie Prince Charlie, which is paralleled
by the stunning views of the surrounding Benbecula and South Uist 
islands, making it the ideal location for those looking to totally 
escape the rat race.'

The 
970-acre island also has sporting rights, and in recent years the land 
has been used for woodcock and duck shooting. There is also red deer 
stalking and fishing.

Located
half a mile south-east of Benbecula, Wiay is accessed by private boat 
from Petersport to a sheltered bay close to the ruined cottage on the 
west side of the island.

Famous visitor: Hercules with owner Maggie Robin. The bear made the island its home briefly when it got lost on Benbecula filming an advert there

Wiay from the air. The island has been uninhabited for over a century, although the current owners - the Chettle family from England, who bought it in 2003 - used it for holidays and summer camping

Bonnie Prince Charlie eventually sought shelter in this cave on Wiay, now known as 'Prince Charlie's Rest', while his followers kept watch for the British navy

The prince eventually obtained passage to France and escaped, pledging to his remaining followers that he would return with an army

The
island is predominately heather clad, with a small number of freshwater
lochs, rising to 335ft at Beinn a'Tuath.

But it is best known for 
playing its part in the escape of the prince following the defeat of his
Jacobite forces at Culloden in 1746.

In
1745, Charles travelled to the Highlands to raise the Scottish clans in
rebellion against the current British monarch - King George II, of the 
house of Hanover.

His plan was to make his father James Stuart, the 'Old Pretender', king.

But
after Culloden, he fled west and was transported to the Outer Hebrides 
by boat in an eight-hour voyage in atrocious conditions.

He eventually 
sought shelter in a cave on Wiay, now known as "Prince Charlie's Rest", 
while his followers kept watch for the British navy. He was brought 
fresh clothing and it appears this was the first time the prince wore 
Highland dress.

Prince 
Charles spent the next few weeks in hiding, employing several disguises.
He lived like a commoner and ate drammach, a type of oatmeal mixed raw 
with seawater.

After two months on the run, he met Flora MacDonald on 
South Uist and a plan was hatched to return him to Skye and then to the 
mainland.

The Prince was disguised as Flora's "Irish Maid" - "Betty 
Burke" - and they made the famous journey by rowing boat to Skye, 
evading capture on the way.

Home sweet home: The island was sold for the price of a London semi

MacDonald
then aided the prince in his escape to Portree, where they parted 
company never to meet again. After several more weeks in hiding, the 
prince obtained passage to France and escaped, pledging to his remaining
followers that he would return with an army.

Wiay
since slipped back into obscurity. One former resident, William Buie, 
left the island in 1825 to become a banker in Canada.

Although the 
island was logged as having six inhabitants in 1861, it was deserted by 
the turn of the 20th century.
