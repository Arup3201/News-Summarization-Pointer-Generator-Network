Kurdish television has joined the fight against the Islamic State with a parody video which labels them as 'brainless' and says they milk goat 'even if it is male'.

The video begins with the performers saying they are 'bearded, filthy and dirty' and that they are 'brainless, with nothing in our heads'.

The performers then go on to say ISIS 'kill the dove in the sky and bring history to the present' before concluding: 'We are ISIS, we are ISIS, we milk the goat even if it is male.'

The song goes on to say that ISIS fighters 'milk the goat even if it is male'

The video follows a similar Looney Tunes-style cartoon which poked fun at the extremists that aired in the Middle East earlier this month.

The satirical animation mocked the jihadists' radical ideas and portrays the group as narcissistic, deluded and obsessed with a literal interpretation of Islam that forces them go to ridiculous lengths to ensure they do not use any item that wasn't available in the 7th Century.

ISIS fighters, who rebranded as the Islamic State earlier this year after declaring the establishment of a caliphate in the large swaths of the Middle East under their control, have themselves repeatedly created slick recruitment videos to spread their radical message.

In response to the Islamic State's campaign of terror in Syria and Iraq, television networks throughout the Middle East have embraced cartoons and comedy to ridicule the group's radical views.
