Forget the Top of the Rock or the Empire State.

The best view of New York City last weekend was from the air, as five Red Bull Air Force Wingsuit Flyers accomplished their dream of skydiving from above one of the world’s most recognizable skylines - Manhattan and managed to catch it all on tape via headcam.

The flight was in anticipation of the 2014 Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach in Long Island this Memorial Day Weekend.

As they come closer to the concrete and the Hudson River, the brave flyers pop their parachutes to prepare for landing

The elite aerial athletes of the Red Bull Air Force, who have performed at the locations in the world, started at the southern tip of the island, jumping from a plane at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

They were traveling at speeds of about 120 mph and headed uptown, passing the skyscrapers of the Financial District.

The flight lasted about two miles and took about two minutes.

It finished with the crew landing on a barge in the Hudson River.

The troop was made up of Wingsuit Flyers Jon Devore, Jeff Provenzano, Amy Chmelecki, Sean MacCormac and Andy Farrington are part of the Red Bull Air Force (RBAF).

'Being from New York, this is so special and I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a kid,' said Provenzano, who grew up just north of the city. 

'It’s been years of looking up at the big buildings and wondering if there is a day that I can fly over them.

'That day was today.'

The Red Bull Air Force will be performing multiple jumps for the large crowds expected at the Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach.

The fete will also feature Military aircraft flying information, an airshow and skydiving.

High five! The flyers get a thumbs up for an awesome flight and realistic vertigo inducing footage
