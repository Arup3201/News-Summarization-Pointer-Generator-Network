A soldier who lost both legs in a Taliban bomb blast has become the first person to travel from Land's End to John O'Groats in a straight line.

Captain Nick Beighton, 32, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, stepped on a hidden Taliban bomb while serving in Helmand province in 2009.

Despite losing both his legs above the knee in the blast, the hero has become the first person to travel the length of Britain in a straight line using just the power of his arms.

The hero, pictured front right, began his epic journey 28 days ago - starting the 1100km trek with a 34-hour sea kayak journey from John O'Groats to Pembrokeshire

Captain Beighton covered over 1100km in the Beeline Britain challenge - which was supported by Prince Harry.

He crossed the Irish Sea in a kayak, before crossing the Isle of Man and the Cairngorm mountain range in a specially adapted bike.

During the adventure, the hero spent 100 hours in a sea kayak - 
including one journey from Land's End to Pembrokeshire which lasted 34 hours.

He also used a specially 
adapted hand-powered bike and crutches to help him walk on his stumps to cover vast mountain ranges.

The captain crossed the finishing line at 12.30pm yesterday after 28 days.

The hero and his four-person team took on 
the challenge for the disabled veterans charity Blesma - the British 
Limbless Ex-Service Men's Association.

He said he wanted the Beeline Britain challenge to show you can still chase your dreams after suffering life changing injuries.

He said: 'My body has been blown up and bolted back together again and I know Beeline Britain would test it to its limits.

'For me I wanted to show how life changing injuries don't limit your ability to tackle epic challenges.'

Prince Harry phoned the team to congratulate them after they arrived at John O'Groats.

Prince Harry said: 'This was a seriously hard and arduous journey, in such a short space of time.

'You've started something that other people can really latch on to and we're going to make sure we do our best to support it.'

The team stop to remember the fallen on the 70th anniversary of D-Day. The challenge was supported by Prince Harry - who phoned the hero to congratulate him as he finished his challenge yesterday

The other members of the team included RAF helicopter crewman Ian O'Grady, outdoor instructor Adam Harmer and adventurer Tori James.

Challenge creator Ian O'Grady said he was hugely proud the team had crossed the finish line.

He said: 'Three years ago this was just a crazy idea I had to raise awareness of how inspirational our injured veterans are.'

The hero was a Captain in the Royal Engineers when he stepped on an IED in 2009.

Since the blast, he has gone on to represent Team GB in rowing at the London Paralympics.
