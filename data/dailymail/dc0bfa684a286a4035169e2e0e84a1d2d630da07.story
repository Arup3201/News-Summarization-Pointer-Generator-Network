A hero soldier who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War contemplated desertion after becoming sick of the hell and horror of the Western Front, a recently discovered letter reveals.

Lance Corporal John Thomas wrote a dispirited letter home to his brother and sister months after displaying incredible bravery that won him the highest military decoration for valour.

The 31-year-old snuck off with another soldier to spy on a German position ahead of an enemy counter-attack. 

Lance Corporal John Thomas, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valour in World War One, considered deserting the army after witnessing his comrades being 'blown to bits'

Despite his colleague being shot and killed, Lance Corporal Thomas carried on by himself and shot three snipers on the way.

He spent an hour observing the enemy preparations and returned to provide vital information that gave the British the upper hand.

But within months the inspiration that won him the VC had disappeared after witnessing dozens of comrades ‘blown to pieces’ by shelling.

The letter penned by Corporal Thomas in 1918 describes the heavy losses his battalion suffered. He was among just 35 out of 950 who survived the horror

The shattered soldier told his siblings they had no idea of the terrible things the men endured in the trenches.

Near to breaking point, he went on to write how he considered walking off towards the German lines to be taken prisoner just so the war would be over for him.

The remarkably frank letter has surfaced nearly 100 years later after it was put up for sale at auction.

Lance Corporal Thomas, of the North Staffordshire Regiment, penned the five page letter home in 1918 following a battle that decimated his 950 strong battalion to just 35 men.

He said: ‘You people at home don’t realise the terrible things we have to go through. What, with liquid fire, boiling oil, gas, rifle and machine guns and shells bursting around us and blowing poor men to pieces.

‘I have just come out of action, after some very hard fighting. There was only 35 left out of 950 men.

So I have been lucky to pull through.

‘It was terrible fighting. It’s as hard a fighting as I have seen. I am fighting for your safety and them children at home.

Corporal Thomas writes to his family back home about wanting to 'forget the troubles' of the war

‘I am not the same as some men out here who are fighting for their wives and family.

‘Can you tell me, why, I should be so loyal when I have no friends?

‘It’s just as easy for me to walk to the German lines and be taken prisoner and then, I should be sure of being out of the terrible ordeal of this warfare.’

Lance Corporal Thomas wrote about his hatred of the enemy, who he described as swine.

He said: ‘The Huns are making their final blow to smash the British Army from the French.

‘But they will never manage it, if they couldn’t do it in 1914 when we only had a handfull (sic) of men, I am dam (sic) sure they can’t do it now. I’ll stake my life that this war is over within 6 months.

‘Two more pushes and then the Huns are beat. We simply cut them up in thousands although we have to loose men to do it, but he looses a dam (sic) sight more than we do.

‘So dear Brother and Sister...think of a lonely soldier out here fighting for civilisation and humanity, we have enough to do to fight the dirty hun, the lowest of the low. They are worse than swine.’

The letter was acquired direct from the Thomas family by a well-known autograph hunter called Bill Dean. After he died his collection went to the unnamed man who is now selling it.

Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions, said: ‘Most letters I have read from soldiers fighting on the Western front convey a stiff-upper lip attitude.

‘But this letter is completely different in its tone. You sense that the author is near to the end of their tether having witnessed and endured such awful tragedies of war.

‘I guess that after three years of hard fighting he was entitled to feel that way.

‘Yet it was only a few months before that he showed such gallantry to risk his own life in order to give his side the upper hand in a battle.

‘It’s hard to believe that it is the same man in the letter.’Lance Corporal John Thomas survived the war and died in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 1954 aged 67.

The letter is being sold this Saturday at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow, London, with a pre-sale estimate of £600.
