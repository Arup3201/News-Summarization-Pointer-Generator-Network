Donatella Versace describes Versace's new Autumn/Winter 2013 campaign as 'stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and the models'.

She says there is 'no set, no distraction', and in the case of one of the models used in the stark, electric shoot, there are barely any clothes, either.

British supermodel Kate Moss, a long-time Versace favourite, appears in two images for the brand's new campaign - in one wearing just a fluffy yellow and black coat, and in another simply three colourful handbags, carefully positioned to cover her modesty.

With strikingly dark hair, the 
usually blonde mother-of-one, 39, stares open-mouthed at the camera, 
clutching three Demetra bags from the Vanitas line, in black, yellow and
red, valued at £1,505 each.

In
the second shot, Moss is enveloped in a fluffy yellow and black coat, 
with her newly-dyed brown hair tousled over her face, and wearing 
nothing beneath the coat.

Dutch artist and model Saskia de Brauw has worked with Givenchy, Versace, MaxMara, Chanel, Loewe, Fendi, Prada, Giorgio Armani and Lanvin

Saskia de Brauw was given far more clothes to wear than Moss, including this very unforgiving black dress, that only someone with a figure like de Brauw would be able to pull off

The other models in the campaign fare slightly better than Moss when it comes to being permitted to remain covered up.

Saskia de Brauw, a Dutch artist and model who has worked with Givenchy, Versace, MaxMara, Chanel, Loewe, Fendi, Prada, Giorgio Armani and Lanvin, was given two punk outfits to wear: a pair of black PVC trousers and a sleeveless patterned top, and a PVC skin-tight dress.

Travis Smith, Dominik Bauer and Matt Trethe are snapped much more fully-dressed - though Smith does get the chance to flash some chest wearing a patterned, open monochrome jacket, similarly-hued and chunky biker boots.

The campaign was shot by Mert Alas & Marcus Piggot, photography partners since 1995 and, with several Moss Vogue cover shots in their portfolio, old friends of the British model.

The art director was Giovanni Bianco, best known for his work with Madonna, and stylists were Melanie Ward and David Bradshaw.

Versace said: 'Versace campaign for Autumn/Winter 2013 is stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and models.

'There's no set, no distraction, just the provocation, glamour and attitude of our fashion. Mert & Marcus genius transformed Kate and Saskia into these strong Versace characters.'

Moss, centre, is a long-time Versace favourite, and has worked with the fashion house on many campaigns, including this shoot seven years ago, age 32
