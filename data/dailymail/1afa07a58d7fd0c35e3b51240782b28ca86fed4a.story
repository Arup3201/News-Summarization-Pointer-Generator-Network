After a four-year investigation into Toyota's disclosure of safety problems, the U.S. reached a $1.2 billion settlement with the Japanese automaker, according to a person close to the investigation.

According to the source, Attorney General Eric Holder, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, were announcing the settlement Wednesday morning.

The investigation focused on whether Toyota Motor Corp. was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration issues.

In this November 2010, a Toyota Camry is shown after it crashed on Utah highway. Police suspect problems with the Camry's accelerator or floor mat caused the crash that left two people dead and two others injured

In a statement early on Wednesday, Toyota 
said it has 'cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's office in this matter 
for more than four years' and had 'made fundamental changes to become a 
more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed 
to continued improvements.'

From 2010 to 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines of more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration issues.

In 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls in
 the U.S. totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various issues 
including faulty brakes, gas pedal and floor mats.

Last
 year, Toyota agreed to pay more than $1 billion to resolve hundreds of 
lawsuits claiming owners suffered economic losses due to the recalls.

But the settlement did not include wrongful death and injury lawsuits.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration never found defects in electronics or software in Toyota cars, which had been targeted as a possible cause.

The settlement continues a string of bad publicity for Toyota, which before the unintended acceleration cases had a bulletproof image of reliability.

Since the cases surfaced, the company's brand image has been damaged and it has lost U.S. market share as competition has intensified.
