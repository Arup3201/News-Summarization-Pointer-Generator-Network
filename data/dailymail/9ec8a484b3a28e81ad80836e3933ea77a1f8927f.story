Wayne Rooney responded in style to revelations that he had been knocked-out while boxing in his own kitchen, by leading Manchester United to victory, scoring a wonderful goal and producing a punch-drunk celebration.

A resounding 3-0 win against Tottenham kept United in the top four of the Barclays Premier League and lifted spirits at Old Trafford.

The goals came from Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Rooney, who had been in the spotlight on a day when The Sun broadcast video footage of him being floored by a punch from Stoke defender Phil Bardsley during an impromptu sparring session.

The two footballers, wearing boxing gloves, square up in Rooney's kitchen and spar for a few seconds before Bardsley lands a jab to put the England and United skipper flat on his back, seemingly unconscious.

Rooney voiced his disappointment that a private moment, filmed inside his home on February 22, had been made public, a view shared by Louis van Gaal, who was clearly irritated by the story and seemed unperturbed by the nature of his captain's pastime.

After scoring United's third against Spurs, Rooney let fly with a flurry of fake punches and fell on his back, much as he did in the video clip taken last month, although the Old Trafford turf seemed to provide a far softer landing than his kitchen tiles.

'That's the world we live in today,' said Rooney. 'It was a few mates in a private house which has somehow managed to get on the front page of a national newspaper. I have to accept that. It was me and a few friends joking around.

'It's my own home, I know it's got out but it's not public. It's what friends do. They mess around in the house and unfortunately it has made the front page of a national newspaper.

'I've just been focused on the game, it's more interesting for other people rather than for myself. You've seen that I've done a professional job, got on with the game and gladly helped my team win 3-0.'

Carrick admitted the players had been teasing Rooney about his sparring antics, while Fellaini revealed how the skipper had delivered a rousing speech to the squad in the team hotel on the eve of the game.

'I was aware of the speech but was not in the meeting because the captain has his own privilege,' said Van Gaal. 'The players knew this game was massive and the captain has to do something to help the players, the manager or the club. I was very pleased.

'I don't want to answer questions about what happened. What is this world, twisted? I don't have any comment. It is ridiculous that we have to talk about such things.'

The Dutchman was happier to discuss Rooney's performance. 'It's always how Wayne plays,' said Van Gaal. 'With a lot of commitment and that's nice to see.

'We have waited a long time for such a victory, with a very good performance against a very good team, so I am very pleased. It was nice after the defeat against Arsenal to do that in the next game against a competitor. We did everything. We were compact and scored beautiful goals.

'We were lucky that the first chance was a goal, and then you raise your confidence. We also played quicker than usual and that depends on the confidence of your players. Also the opponent. Tottenham are a team who wants to play, therefore you have more time and space to play the game.'

After a weekend when Chelsea and Manchester City dropped points, Van Gaal declared United in the race for second, but would not declare a late charge for the title. 'We go step by step, it's a rat race,' he said. 'We have made a big step but we have to go to Liverpool next, also a competitor of ours.'

Rooney added: 'The first half was probably the best 45 minutes we've played this season. In the second half we didn't want to lose advantage of the three goals we had. We defended really well and made sure we've seen the game out.

'We knew it was a big game. With Manchester City losing and Southampton drawing it was a big game for us. We've taken the points off Tottenham, so it's a great three points for us.'
