The family of a loving couple killed when their home was destroyed in a huge gas explosion have spoken of their 'insurmountable' grief.

Suhail Akhtar, 46, and Dorota Kolasisnska, 34, had been together for ten years when the devastating blast ripped through their home, destroyed two other houses and left their bodies buried in the rubble.

Friends and colleagues also remembered the generous, popular and hardworking couple, who loved to cycle and would raise money for charity in their spare time.

'Void': Friends and family spoke of their loss after Suhail Akhtar, left, and Dorota Kolasinska, right, died in a gas explosion on Monday

Mr Akhtar, an IT contracter, and Ms Kolasinska, a council traffic controller, will be 'sorely missed', their friends said, while Mr Akhtar's family, speaking for the first time since the tragedy, said the couple's 'passion for life' will be what they remember most.

They said: 'Suhail and Dorota’s loss has left an 
insurmountable void in our lives. Suhail’s passion for living life to 
the max and their exuberance touched all our lives. It will be our 
enduring memory of them both.'

Speaking earlier in the week, after the couple were first named, close friend Sheldon Hawkshaw, 
42, said he was 'in shock'.

Mr Hawkshaw, who also works in IT, said he spoke to Mr Akhtar 'every day'.

'We went skiing together, motorcycling every weekend - he was very active, always in the gym.

'He
was a go-to guy. He always had time for everyone, he was a great friend
to us. He always made us laugh and will be sorely missed.'

Colleagues of Ms Kolasinska, who had worked as a traffic controller at Hackney Council for nine months, described her as 'extremely popular and hard-working'.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Kim Wright, a service director at the east London council, said: 'This is a truly tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies are with Dorota's family, friends and colleagues.'

The explosion, which was reported at around 7.30am on Monday, destroyed three houses on the street in Hounslow and damaged two more.

Three people were also injured by the explosion, one of whom was still in hospital the day after.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force was still awaiting results from post-mortem examinations on Mr Akhtar and Ms Kolasinska.

The couple, who had been together for about 10 years, were keen cyclists who enjoyed taking part in charity events, friends said.

Earlier this year they took part in the 
London-to-Brighton charity cycle ride, and in 2012 raised money for 
Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research as part of the London Bikeathon event.

The London Fire Brigade and the National Grid have since launched an investigation into the blast.

The couple were among five people killed during the St Jude storm, which some estimates claim caused £1.8billion of damage across Europe.

Bethany Freeman, a grammar school student from Kent, was crushed after a tree fell on the roof of her caravan. Donal Drohan, 51, an operations manager for Harrow Council, was killed on his way to work when a 40ft tree crashed into his car early in the morning.

Dylan Alkins, a 14-year-old, is also feared to be dead after a huge wave swept him out to sea on Sunday night while he was watching the storm in Newhaven, East Sussex.

Amy Kattenhorn, his mother, said: 'My first-born son has been stolen from me and I am completely and utterly devastated.'
