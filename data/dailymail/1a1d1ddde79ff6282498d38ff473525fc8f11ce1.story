Greedy holidaymakers eat more than double their daily calorie allowance in the first 24 hours of an all-inclusive break, a new study has found.

British tourists gorge on an average of 5,756 calories on their first day away, making the most of the food and drinks included in their package holidays, researchers said.

The binge eating amounts to twice the recommended daily intake for both men and women and would provide enough fuel for a holidaymaker to run more than two marathons.

NHS guidelines dictate the average man needs around 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight, while the average women should consume 2,000 calories each day.

A study carried out by CheapHolidayLand.com quizzed a focus group about their eating and drinking habits while on holiday.

Respondents claimed their day of eating would start with a bowl of cereal followed by a full English breakfast downed with an orange juice and either a cup of tea or coffee – amounting to 1,117 calories in total.

After breakfast many said they would move on to their first alcoholic drink of the day, adding another 240 calories to their daily total.

Many holidaymakers confessed to often opting for a cooked lunch on their first afternoon.

Ttwo glasses of wine (246), a gin and tonic (143), a glass of sangria (150), a slice of cake (275), a fruit salad (146)

Two mojitos (120 calories), one glass of sangria (150), one bottle of beer (153), a packet of peanuts (100)  

Total: 5,756

The vast majority admitted that they almost instantly fell into the trap of thinking everything is free and gorged themselves on the first day.

Dinner proved to be no exception with many returning to the buffet table three or even four times.

Researchers calculated that more than 2,000 calories were consumed at dinner on average.

At 1,418 calories, alcohol accounted for a quarter of the total number of calories consumed on the first day.

One person who took part in the study said: ‘I make the same mistake every time I go on an all-inclusive holiday.

'I fool myself into thinking everything’s free when in fact I’ve already paid for it.

‘Because I think it’s all free I just gorge myself stupid on everything from tea and coffee to gin and tonic.’

Another added: ‘I’m always bemused why I come back a stone heavier from all inclusive holidays, then I tot up everything I’ve eaten and the penny drops.

‘I really don’t know how I can eat that much when I’m abroad, I never stuff myself with that much when I’m here.'

A spokesperson for CheapHolidayLand.com added: ‘It’s staggering to think how much we will feast on during an all-inclusive holiday.

‘Often people will binge on the first day and then rein themselves back in for the remainder of the holiday.’
