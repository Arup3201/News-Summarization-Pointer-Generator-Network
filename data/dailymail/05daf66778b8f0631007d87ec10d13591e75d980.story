Bravery: Norwegian spy Sven Somme fled to Britain after spending two months evading capture and execution following an epic escape from his German captors

The incredible bravery of a member of the Norwegian resistance who escaped his German captors by trekking 200 miles across snowy mountains has been revealed.

Sven Somme fled to Britain after spending two months evading capture and execution following an epic escape.

During his time in the resistance, the spy photographed strategic German military bases in his home country using a covert camera and sent tiny microfilms to the Allies hidden under stamps on letters.

Now, some 70 years later, an incredible archive of secret documents he gathered has been found.

Mr Somme was caught by the Germans in 1944 and arrested for spying, an offence punished by firing squad, but managed to break out of his handcuffs and tip-toe past his sleeping guard.

He was pursued by 900 enemy soldiers with sniffer dogs and trekked for 200 miles across snow-capped mountains, even swinging from pine trees so not to leave footprints behind.

He eventually reached neutral Sweden and safety.

Following the death of his widow, his daughter, Ellie Targett, who lives in Herefordshire, found the intelligence documents that very nearly got him killed during a clear out.

They included parts of envelopes containing tiny maps and intelligence reports hidden under the stamps in the top right corner.

Mrs Targett, 60, found secret instructions sent to Mr Somme from the resistance that had been written in invisible ink over a mundane, typed letter on a piece of A4 paper.

And she also uncovered the Nazi warrant, printed in both German and Norwegian, calling for Mr Somme's immediate arrest and a hand-drawn map on grease-proof paper he used during his escape.

Mrs Targett took the documents, along with the pair of Brogue leather shoes her late father wore during the early stages of his flight to freedom, to a recent Antiques Roadshow event.

Mr Somme managed to swap the brown leather shoes for a pair of mountain boots that were given to him by a family who had sheltered him.

Documents: His daughter has now found an incredible archive of secret documents he collected while working as a spy

Incredibly, they had kept the shoes and gave them to Mrs Targett when she retraced her father's escape in 2004.

Mrs Targett said: 'I knew my father was a spy for the resistance and that he was told he was going to be executed when he was caught because he wrote a manuscript in English as soon as he was safe.

'But I wasn't aware that he kept all these secret documents. My mother had them and when she died all of their stuff ended up in my garage.

'I went through it and found all sorts of documents. I knew what some of them were because he had said that he sent and received microfilms hidden under postage stamps.

Warrant: Mr Somme's daughter also found an arrest warrant issued by the Nazis for his capture

'I scanned one onto my computer and blew
 it up and it was instructions from the resistance movement to 
photograph the German U-boat bases that led to him being captured.'

Mr Somme was a fisheries officer when Norway was occupied by the Germans in 1940.

He
 and his brother Iacob joined the resistance movement and fed vital 
information about German military bases and size of units back to the 
Allies.

Iacob Somme was
 executed by the Gestapo for his part in the famous sabotaging of the 
hydro plant in Telemark the Germans were using to build the nuclear bomb
 in 1943.

Mr Somme, who
 was aged 43 at the time, was captured when German soldiers saw the sun 
reflect off his camera lens while he photographed a U-boat base on the 
island of Otteroy.

Mrs Targett, from Leominster, 
Herefordshire, said: 'His instructions were to photo German military 
torpedo batteries and submarine bases on the west coast.

'How many troops are in that area and where are they billeted, that sort of thing.

'He was spotted and he hid his camera under a stone because he could see the Germans running up to him and firing shots.

'He told them he was watching the birds and talked his way out of it.

'When he tried to get off the island there were two soldiers waiting for him on the jetty - they had found his camera.'

Mr Somme was taken to the mainland by
 boat and while the vessel was docked overnight heÂ  managed to escape 
after his guard fell asleep.

Mrs Targett said: 'He was told he was going to be executed.

'In
 the middle of the night he managed to get out and off the ship. He 
walked passed five armed guards because they thought he was a civilian 
and fled up the mountains.

'Within one hour they found he was gone and sent 900 troops and a pack of blood hounds after him.

'He
 went through ravines and streams before he bagan walking up the 
mountains in his shoes. The higher he got the worse the snow was.

'He
 was found by a friendly family who gave him a new pair of mountain 
boots. When he escaped he only had an old pair of office shoes which 
were no good and would have given him frostbite.'

Mr
 Somme hid out in a safe house for five weeks until false papers were 
made for him before he walked across the border into Sweden.

When he arrived in Britain he was given a private audience with the King of Norway who was in exile.

He later met and married his English wife, Primrose, and they had three children; Ellie, Bertie and Yule.

After he died of cancer aged 58 in 1961, the family moved from Norway to Dartmouth, Devon.

Revealed: The documents found by his daughter include detailed maps

Graham
 Lay, the specialist from the Antiques Roadshow, which is due to feature
 Mr Somme's archive this Sunday, said: 'The resistance was incredibly 
important to the Allies winning the war.

'Without
 these amazingly brave men and women, it's very likely that the outcome 
of the Second World War would have been completely different.

'What
 you have is a testament to an incredibly brave man. He knew - because 
of the fate of his brother - what would await him if he was captured.'
