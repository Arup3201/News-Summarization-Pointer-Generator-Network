Trainer Jamie Osborne has set his sights on a rematch with Bayern in the Dubai World Cup after Toast Of New York was beaten a nose by Bob Baffert’s colt in the $5million Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita.

Toast Of New York was one of Jamie Spencer’s final mounts before he retires.

Coral make the pair 5-1 joint favourites for the March race in Dubai.

Osborne said: ‘He nearly pulled off the impossible.’

Only Karakontie’s win in the Mile for France-based trainer Jonathan Pease prevented a whitewash on a disappointing night for the Europeans. 

Richard Hannon’s Mile favourite Toronado seemed to go too fast too early, fading to eighth. 

Main Sequence, second in the 2012 Derby, held off Andre Fabre’s Arc runner-up Flintshire to win the Turf for new US trainer Graham Motion.
