A driver has been unwittingly given a £60 fine for driving in a bus lane when the actual offender was the council’s own roadsweeper.

Jonathan Palgrave, 32, was stunned to receive the penalty notice from Sheffield City Council despite having never visited the city.

The fine was sent to Mr Palgrave’s house, almost 100 miles away in Spalding, Lincolnshire, along with a photograph of the offending vehicle.

Rego's wrong: Jonathan Palgrave was unwittingly fined £60 for driving in a bus lane in Sheffield - a city he had never visited before - after the council mixed up the 'E' in his number plate with 'B' in the offending vehicle's plates

Is it 'B' or 'E'? The council included this image of the offending vehicle, its number plate in clear view but it is not Mr Palgrave's Tiger kit car, rather it is a council roadsweeper in the bus lane

But the photo revealed a Sheffield City Council roadsweeper in the bus lane driven by a council worker wearing a fluorescent jacket on August 21.

On closer inspection Mr Palgrave, who drives a Tiger kit car – not a roadsweeper, noticed that his number plate was exactly the same as the roadsweeper’s bar one letter, the council mixing up a ‘B’ for an ‘E’.

But when Jonathan contacted the authority to point out their mistake, he was stunned to be told by council workers that he must still go through the authority’s official statutory complaints procedure before the fine could be overturned. 

He was also told the penalty could rise up to £90 if he failed to pay the fine within 28 days and threatened with possible legal action if it still wasn’t paid after that.

'Bureaucratic nightmare': Mr Palgrave contacted the council about the fine (right) after noticing that the offending roadsweeper (left) had a very similar number plate, but was told that he still had to go through the authority's official complaints procedure. The council have since cancelled the fine

Mr Palgrave said today: ‘It’s just been a bureaucratic nightmare and it makes you wonder if it has happened before.

‘It makes you want to know if it’s all automated or if someone looks at what they are actually sending out.

‘I think I might write back on the form “have a look on the back” so they look and see their own sweeper.

‘When
I first got it I just thought “oh my god, where have I been?” I thought
I was going to have to pay the fine. Then I realised I have never been 
to Sheffield in my life, let alone driven there.

‘When I turned over the form I just laughed, there was the picture of this huge sweeper just sweeping the curb.

‘They
must have just mistaken the E in my car’s registration for the B in the
sweepers, that’s the difference, other than them being completely 
different cars.

Should check their records: Mr Palgrave, who has owned the £17,000 Tiger kit car for three months, said he has felt angry but not can't help but laugh at the mix up

‘I’m almost tempted to wait and take this to court and see what they say when it all gets to court.

‘I’ve felt every emotion going - at first I was angry, then confused and now I can’t help but laugh about it. 

‘To send a picture of their own vehicle, which they will have records of is brilliant.

‘They should really check those records from time to time.’

Mr Palgrave has owned the £17,000 kit car for three months.

He said: ‘I’m happy with my kit car for now but perhaps I could avoid any potential parking and speeding tickets in future if I bought a council road sweeper.’

The letter from Sheffield City Council informed Mr Palgrave of his Bus Lane Penalty Charge Notice under the Transport Act 2000.

It read: ‘The alleged contravention has been detected and recorded by an Approved CCTV device. 

‘Sheffield City Council having reason therefore to believe that a penalty charge notice is payable, serves this PCN on you, as the person appearing to the Council to be the owner of the vehicle of the person liable to pay the penalty charge.’

Sheffield City Council today apologised for the embarrassing error and agreed to cancel the penalty notice.

A spokesperson said: 'The ticket has now been cancelled and we apologise for the confusion. This is the first time this kind of mistake has happened.'
