The dog spent several days in sub-zero temperatures maintaining its poignant vigil in the Savannah cemetery

The dog moved its dead puppy to a quiet part of the cemetery where it would not be disturbed 

Photographer Hunter Cone spotted the dog while visiting the cemetery. He told WTOC: 'At first I was like "jeez, that's pretty hard and that's pretty heavy". It made me feel really depressed and upset. That's something I didn't want to see, but I'm kind of glad I did.”

The graveyard is one of the most historic in Savannah.  

Mr Cone said: 'I mean, the dog braced through the cold, starvation and thirst to stay with its dead puppy. I don't want there to be another dead dog in the cemetery. As ironic as it sounds. It's still very sad.'

Mr Cone and his mother brought the dog some food to help it survive. 

He added: 'If this doesn't prove that dogs have feelings just like humans do, I don't think anything else will.'

It is understood that the dog buried its puppy in the cemetery and ran off.
