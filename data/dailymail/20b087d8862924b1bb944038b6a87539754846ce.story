The family of an unarmed Missouri 18-year-old who was shot dead by police this weekend have condemned a frightening riot that erupted in St Louis last night claiming the violence was not what the teen would have wanted.

In a statement to Fox News last night, a cousin of victim Mike Brown said the looting, which followed a peaceful vigil for the teen, was 'very upsetting' to their family.

'I just want everyone to know and understand that the stealing and breaking in stores is not what Mike will want, it is very upsetting to me and my family,' the statement read.

'Our 
family didn't ask for this but for Justice and Peace... Please let my 
family grieve in Peace in (sic) stop the violence in the street, we 
don't want this happening when we protest for justice for my cousin Mike Brown, please get this message out to the people that the Mike Brown's family do not want this.'

Speaking to Fox News off camera, Brown's mother, Leslie McSpadden, said she was 'furious' by what has unfolded.

She
 told the TV station that the violence was 'disrespecting the memory of 
her son' and was not helping her cause, which is to seek justice for her
 son and peace for her family.

The
 devastated mother, who is still in shock after losing her don, added 
that she was even scared to go home last night because of the chaos in 
the streets.

People
 smashed car windows and looted armloads of goods from stores after the 
vigil for the unarmed black teen who was shot and killed by a police 
officer on Saturday.Â

The
 candlelight gathering was held in Ferguson, St Louis for Brown, who 
police said was shot multiple times after a scuffle involving an 
officer, Brown and another person in the predominantly black suburb of 
the city.

After
 the vigil, which attracted thousands, some people looted a convenience 
store, while several other stores along a main road near the shooting 
scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a 
boutique and a small grocery store.

People
 were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper and TV footage showed 
streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of 
alcohol.

In some cases protesters were also standing on top police cars and taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear.

Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows.

Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.

'Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,' Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, told St. Louis KTVI-TV. 'Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this.'

As the investigation of Brown's death progresses, 'we understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out,' Knowles added. 'We're going to obviously try to urge calm.'

St Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage.

'Right now I'm just worried about people, not property,' he said.

At least 32 people had been arrested by the time the looting stopped, according to Fox News.

Earlier in
 the day, hundreds of protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police 
headquarters.

Trouble brewing: A QuikTrip station appeared to bear the brunt of the group's hostilities Sunday evening as trouble broke out around 8:30

'Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,' Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, told St. Louis KTVI-TV

'Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this,' Mayor Knowles said

At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police
 building, some chanting 'Don't shoot me' while holding their hands in 
the air.

Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force and the crowd eventually left.

County
 Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting of Brown occurred after an officer 
encountered two people on the street near an 
apartment complex in Ferguson.

Mr Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began.

He added at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still establishing what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times.

He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Mr Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged, although authorities aren't sure if that person was unarmed.

Photos of the chaos quickly turned up on social media, like these shots of a man smashing the glass of what appears to be a bus stop

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage. 'Right now I'm just worried about people, not property,' he said

Taking to the streets: The chaos broke out after what was largely a peaceful vigil in the name of the slain teen

Mr Jackson told KSDK-TV there's no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put in use.

He added blood samples have been taken from Brown and the officer who shot him, with those toxicology tests expected to take weeks to complete.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said her son had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college.

She
 said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue him with a 
club or Taser, and believes the officer involved should be fired and 
prosecuted.

'I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,' she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some 
civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting
 of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer
 who was acquitted of murder charges.

McSpadden
 has hired Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented family of slain 
Florida teen Trayvon Martin, to represent her family.

Crump was expected to hold a press conference on the matter Monday morning.

Meanwhile, civil rights campaigners have raised their concerns with Brown's death.

John Gaskin, who serves on both the St Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP said: 'We're outraged yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement.'

The Reverend Al Sharpton also called the shooting 'very disturbing' and said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family.

St.
 Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and 
county executive Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation.

The U.S. Justice 
Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had also instructed staff to 
monitor developments.
