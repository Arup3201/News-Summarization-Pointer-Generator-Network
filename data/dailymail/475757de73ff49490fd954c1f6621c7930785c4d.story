A heartbreaking tale could well have a happy ending.

A puppy, that was found by a group of workers at a construction site in Turkey with its ears cut off, is getting used to her new life at a local veterinary facility in the province of Bursa.

The young dog - named Can - was bleeding from the head when teams from the municipal veterinary institution arrived at the scene and they immediately took it in for surgery.

Before being put in with his new friends, the puppy is allowed to take in its new environment

Wearing a special collar for her own protection, the extent of the puppy's injuries is  evident from a large portion of scaring on her head.

In the video footage, she is allowed to approach some other dogs who are in a cage, prior to being fully introduced.

Just before the puppy is thrown in with new friends, she is given a friendly tickle to calm any nerves.

And all seems well in the new dog shelter, with the puppy affectionately nuzzling her  new housemate.

It is hoped the dog - named Can - will come on leaps and bounds despite the horrific savagery

'Her ears were cut from their base. But we have successfully conducted a plasticesthetic surgery. 

'Our puppy, which we have named 'Can,' will be able to regain her health soon' said veterinary surgeon Ayşe Yazıcı following the operation.

Animal rights activists have often complained about the lack of legal provisions regarding the torture of animals without owners. But the local veterinary department head, Mürsel Büyükçoban, stressed that the current law does contain measures against those who cut the ears or the tail of animals.

'Unfortunately, there are people still doing it despite all the warnings and sanctions. This is just inhumane,' Büyükçoban said.

There are still people in Turkey who continue to carry out 'inhumane' acts against dogs

Local in Turkey have long believed to show good care to their pets and even stray dogs and cats, but in recent months there has been a rise of violence against these animals reported.

A woman was captured on security cameras kicking to death stray kittens and was caught in August by police in Istanbul. Another man in Eskişehir was captured beating to death a stray dog.

This has led to animal rights activists urging the government to change the legislation that labels dogs as 'goods' rather than 'living'. 

This essentially means if something is found to have beaten, or even killed a dog, it would be classed as damaging 'property' and could see the assailant let off with a fine.
