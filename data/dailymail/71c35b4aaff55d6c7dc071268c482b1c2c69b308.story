'Our concern is that multiple overseas deaths have been attributed to the drug PMMA, in particular a pink/light red "Superman" symbol tablet, found to contain deadly amounts of PMMA,' he said.

'We believe there is a possibility this particular tablet form may be circulating in Australia, however this has not been confirmed at this point.'

PMMA can be a white powder, but can also appear pink, beige or yellowish on the street. 

In Queensland, it has been detected in other tablet and capsule forms.

The Dr Death pill has already killed a number of people overseas, including British couple Suzanne Van Hagen and John Worton

It also claimed the life of 15-year-old schoolgirl Martha Fernback from the United Kingdom

Det Supt Wacker said police were not just singling out one drug or suggesting one is more or less dangerous than any other.

'It is important to understand that any illicit drug is potentially lethal as you really have no idea what you’re actually buying, nor in most cases does the person selling it to you,' he said.

'We are however warning the public of the hazards of these drugs and the consequences.'

The Dr Death pill has already killed a number of people overseas, including British couple Suzanne Van Hagen and John Worton whose nine-year-old daughter found them dead in bed and 15-year-old schoolgirl Martha Fernback.
