This is the terrifying moment a fisherman was almost wrestled into the sea by a gigantic fish.

The mystery man was dangling his arm over the edge of a jetty, believed to be somewhere in Florida, as he tempted the fish with a morsel of bait.

Then, much to the horror of screaming onlookers, the monster leaps from the water and latches on to his arm, seemingly trying to drag him back to the water.

This is the terrifying moment a fisherman was almost wrestled into the sea by a gigantic fish as he tried to tempt it with a piece of bait

The man, who it is believed had been trying to catch the fish by hand, was almost pulled into the sea by the creature. As he tries to move back (right) the fish refuses to let go, instead latching on to his arm

Video taken by an onlooker shows the pair wrestling the length of the jetty with the fish refusing to let go of the man's arms as he desperately tries to free himself.

After a dramatic tussle - which sees the man knocked to the floor by the gigantic catch - he is helped free by two other men.

Eventually the fish - believed to be a tarpon - flips back into the water victorious, as the man walks away, visibly relieved, but also appearing to be dripping with blood.

It is believed the man had been trying to catch the fish without the use of a rod.

The pair are filmed wrestling the length of the jetty, with the fish - believed to be a tarpon - refusing to give up. Eventually the man is helped free by two others and, victorious, the fish flips back into the waters

Tarpon are known by fishermen as the 'silver king'.

It is an extremely strong fish with a huge mouth which has extremely small densely packed villiform - or teeth.

They can reach 2.5m (eight ft) in length and weigh 160kg (350lb) and while it is not eaten, the fish are mainly caught for sport.

It is not the first time tarpon have been known to attack. There have been many incidents at docks in Florida when people who have been trying to hand feed them have been knocked off their feet by the quick fish.
