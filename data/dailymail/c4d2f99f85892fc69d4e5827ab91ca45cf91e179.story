During their visit the Royals have visited the White House, watched basketball with Jay-Z and Beyonce, and rubbed shoulders with creme-de-la-creme of New York high society. 

The Royal couple also paid a solemn visit to the 9/11 memorial a short distance away, laying a wreath of white flowers.

After touring the adjoining museum, Kate said she had been left 'in awe' at the scale of the tragedy, adding that she had not anticipated how emotional the visit would be.

On Tuesday evening the couple swapped Lower Manhattan for an elegant black tie event to help raise money for their Alma Mater: St Andrews University, where they met and fell in love.

The pair were the guests of honour at the lavish $10,000-a-head 600th anniversary event at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the couple's final engagement of their three-day visit.

After a reception on the museum's Velez Blanco patio the couple were taken for dinner in the Temple of Dendur, a vast room decorated with statues of Egyptian gods that was built specifically to house an Egyptian temple built just before the birth of Christ. 

The sandstone temple was given to the U.S. in its entirety in 1965.

After a speech given by comedian Seth Myers, drafted in  last-minute after Tom Hanks pulled out for personal reasons, the Duke and Duchess were whisked straight to the airport for a flight home.
