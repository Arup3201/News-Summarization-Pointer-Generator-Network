Super-fit aerobics instructor Joe Houpapa has died two days after he hit his head while running with young son

A well-known New Zealand gym instructor has died two days after falling and hitting his head while jogging with his young sons.

On Sunday, Joe Houpapa was running when he collapsed and sustained a head injury. He later died early Tuesday morning.

The 40-year-old father-of-four was jogging with his young sons Luca and Le Bron, who are both at primary school, at about 4pm when he fell, reported The New Zealand Herald.

A personal trainer and instructor of 20 years at Les Mills gym in Victoria Park, Auckland, he was super-fit at the time of his death.

Teaching body pump and combat classes, these helped keep him in peak physical condition.

The gym general manager Jackie Marshall the circumstances around the death were still unclear.

'He suffered a massive head trauma through the fall but nobody knows what caused the fall,' she said.

'He was jogging behind his two boys, and when they turned around their dad was on the ground.'

It is yet to be determined if Mr Houpapa simply tripped or was suffering from an underlying medical condition but Ms Marshall said a post-mortem would shed more light on this.

The 40-year-old had been a personal trainer and instructor at an Auckland gym for 20 years

During his two-decade career with the gym, Mr Houpapa taught other Les Mills instructors internationally, Ms Marshall said.

'He's probably one of the most loved (trainers) around,' she said and added his two passions in life were his family and Les Mills.

The popular trainer leaves behind his partner Trish, teenage daughter Kiana and preschooler Eden, who along with his two sons, are all  struggling to come to terms with the death, Ms Marshall said.

A memorial service was held for the trainer yesterday.

The Les Mills Facebook page posted about the devastating loss on Tuesday.

'Today we sadly farewell Joe Houpapa. A dearly loved and respected member of the Les Mills tribe. Our hearts go out to his family and friends at this tragic time,' the post reads.

'Joe, you will be sorely missed but never forgotten.'

Peopled commented about their sadness at his death including Yvette Skogstad-Archer who wrote: 'RIP Joe. You were my favorite instructor. Love and thoughts to all of his Family, Les Mills family and friends.'Â 

A Givealittle fund has been set up by the gym to help support Mr Houpapa's family and as of Thursday night nearly $44,000 had been raised.

'His (Joe's) absence will be sorely felt by all his colleagues, clients, and members of Les Mills,' the fundraising page reads.

'We have set up this fund as many people have approached us asking how they can donate to support Joe's partner Trish and their children.

'All money raised will help Joe's partner, Trish, and their children as they go through this incredibly tough time in their lives.'
