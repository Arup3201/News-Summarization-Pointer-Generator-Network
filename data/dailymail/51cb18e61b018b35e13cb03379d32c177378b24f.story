Engineers are working on the Bloodhound- the supersonic car that's faster than a speeding bullet which is hoped to break the land speed record.

The British-made vehicle, which is powered by a Eurofighter jet engine and a rocket, is being built as the fastest car in the world to beat the 763mph (1228km/h) current record which was set by Thrust Supersonic car on 15 October 1997.

Bloodhound is being put together at its design centre in Avonmouth, Bristol as part of a private venture although it has substantial in-kind support from the UK government and is being used as a education resource with the hope that it will encourage more pupils to follow science and technology-related courses.

The project team consists of some of the world’s most revered engineering talent, led by project director Richard Noble and will be driven by Andy Green.

A mock up of what the completed supercar will finally look like goes on display in a British street to the amusement of passersby and a police officer

The car has a slender body of approximately 13.4m length with two front wheels within the body and two rear wheels mounted externally within wheel fairings

It weighs 7.5 tonnes and the engines produce more than 135,000 horsepower - more than 6 times the power of all the Formula 1 cars on a starting grid put together

Engineers work on the carbon-fibre body  of the Bloodhound vehicle, which is powered by a massive Eurofighter jet engine and a rocket

It is hoped that when finished, the Bloodhound car, which is powered by a Eurofighter jet engine and a rocket, will break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h

The huge EJ200 jet engine (pictured) is so powerful it would be able to suck all the air out of an average sized house in three seconds

The Car is a mix of car and aircraft technology, with the front half being a carbon fibre monocoque like a racing car and the back half being a metallic framework and panels like an aircraft

The Bloodhound will travel 150 metres in the blink of an eye and could cover the distance of four and a half football pitches in one second

Royal Airforce engineers work on a tail fin of the Bloodhound vehicle, which is powered by a Eurofighter jet engine and a rockets 

The vehicle's tail fin takes shape under the watchful eye of a team of Royal Airforce engineers who are hoping to create the world's fastest car

The Bloodhound is so powerful that if it was fired into the air, the rocket and engine would blast the car to an altitude of 25,000ft

During the record attempt, where the team will try to break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h, the rocket will reach a blistering 3,000 degrees- twice the temperature of inside a volcano

The incredible Bloodhound car, which is powered by a Eurofighter jet engine and a rocket, is being built to be the fastest car in the world.

Once complete, the car will be able to travel from 0m to 1000m in just 55 seconds and can travel faster than a bullet fired from a Magnum 357.

It will do 150 metres in the blink of an eye and could cover the distance of four and a half football pitches in one second.

Its huge EJ200 jet engine is so powerful it could suck all the air out of an average sized house in three seconds and would blast the car to an altitude of 25,000ft if it was fired straight into the air.

During the attempt, where the team will try to break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h, the rocket will reach a blistering 3,000 degrees- twice the temperature of inside a volcano.
