Mystery death: Rodick Andrew Reymond appeared to have been killed by a blow to the head. His hands and feet were tied and a catalogue of injuries - including what appeared to be cigarette burns - were found on his arms, head and face

A murder hunt has been launched in India after a British tourist's badly-beaten and decomposing body was found wrapped in a carpet, stuffed into a plastic bag and dumped by the side of a road.

Rodick Andrew Reymond, 40, appeared to have been tied up, tortured and beaten to death, police said, before his remains were covered in blue polythene bags and left outside a shop in south Delhi's Bhogal neighbourhood.

His remains were only found when locals raised the alarm yesterday, complaining of a foul smell emanating from a bag.

A police spokesman said: 'We originally thought that it was somebody possibly from Africa, because the body had been in the plastic bags for some days and the skin had turned black.

'But we then found a passport on the body which was also in a bad condition but it was possible to read that the man was a British national.'

When police opened the bag they found Mr Reymond's hands and feet were tied and a catalogue of injuries - including what appeared to be cigarette burns - to his arms, head and face.

A murder investigation has now been launched as detectives await the results of a post mortem examination.

Police said Reymond appeared to have died of head injuries. 'It appears that he was hit in the head with a heavy and blunt object,' a police source told The Indian Express.

'His body was then stuffed into the plastic bag. It also appears that he was stubbed by a cigarette or his skin burnt with a lighter. Nothing is, however, clear as the post-mortem report is not out. The exact cause and time of death will be clear once the report is out.'

He added that it appeared Mr Reymond was a tourist staying at one of the many guest houses in the area and had apparently visited Chennai, Mumbai and Goa before coming to Delhi.

'We are on the case and are trying to gather as many details about him. 
It appears to be a case of personal enmity, but it is too early to say 
anything. We are investigating the matter,' the officer added.

Dumped: His body was found in a plastic bag dumped by the side of a road in Delhi

A police source told The Hindu newspaper: 'Preliminary enquiries revealed that initially many of the locals 
thought the bag belonged to someone in the area who would come and 
collect it later, while others mistook it for a garbage bag.

'Later, the 
bag was opened after the shopkeeper, outside whose premises the bag was 
dumped, came to open the shop. By then the locals had also become 
suspicious as a foul smell had started emanating.'

Police said there were currently looking at CCTV cameras in the area to identify the person who dumped body, adding that they suspect the killer or killers could 
be familiar with the area, as they had dumped the body on the roadside 
only after local guards had clocked off for the day.

Police confirmed that they had been in touch with the British High Commission and Foreign Regional Registration Office to ascertain details about the victim.

A foreign office spokesperson said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in India on April 28. We are in touch with the Indian authorities and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
