When Andrew Britton fell ill on his honeymoon, he chalked it up to a wedding-based hangover.

But nine months, three hospitals and six cardiac arrests later, he is now awaiting a heart transplant after his body was ravaged by a virus.

Mr Britton, 33, collapsed hours after arriving in the Maldives with his wife Lauren, also 33, last November.

The keen triathlete and squash player
 initally blamed it on a hangover, or some dodgy plane food – but his 
condition swiftly deteriorated.

Within days, he had lost two stone and was transferred to a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was put on life-support.

‘I
 finally came round and was so confused,’ he said. ‘I pointed for a pen 
and paper and wrote: “Did I die?” I later learned I had five cardiac 
failures in the Maldives, and a sixth a few days later.’

When he first fell ill, Mr Britton’s wife called for the local doctor, and her husband was eventually put on a drip in his hut.

Island doctors told Andrew they had 24 hours to get him to a specialist heart hospital in Bangkok (pictured there during his recovery) or he would die. He was flown there on an emergency medical jet and remained on life support for two weeks and in the hospital for a total of six weeks.

The
 next day the couple took a boat to the nearest hospital, where Mr 
Britton was found to have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute. He was 
then sedated and given defibrillation shocks.

‘It all happened completely out of the blue and was absolutely terrifying,’ Mrs Britton recalled.

Myocarditis is a viral infection that leads to inflammation and damage to the heart.

The majority of cases clear up within a week, but sometimes the inflammation in the heart lasts longer. 

Symptoms include chest pain, fever, an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath.

There’s no reason why someone with an infection may develop myocarditis - it is often a case of bad luck.

Many
 people don’t realise it, but common bacterial and viral infections such
 as flu, ear and chest infections, and even the common cold can get into
 the bloodstream and affect the heart, explains consultant cardiologist 
Dr Nigel Durham of York Hospital.

‘It’s
 more widespread than we’d thought  - a quarter of patients we see aged 
30 to 35 have evidence of myocarditis, and it is the most common cause 
of sudden adult death.

Myocarditis
 can be mild and sometimes resolves itself - if the condition is spotted
 quickly, anti-inflammatory drugs can treat it.

But
 once the heart muscle becomes enlarged, causing it to stretch, there is
 little that can be done and it can lead to heart failure.

‘I was on the phone to family and friends back at home most of the time, who really kept me going.’

Mr Britton said: ‘At one point our medical insurance hadn’t kicked in and our credit cards were maxed-out.

‘Lauren
 had been given a security escort from the hotel, and he saw the 
situation was so serious that he gave the hospital the deeds to his 
house as security against my treatment.’

Doctors
 warned Mr Britton, a director of InterContinental Hotels, that he would
 die unless they got him to a specialist heart hospital in Bangkok 
within 24 hours.

Thankfully, he was flown there on an emergency medical 
jet, and was placed on life-support for two weeks.

His
 other organs began to fail as doctors worked out which drugs would 
combat the virus; when his kidneys stopped working, hospital staff 
drained 11 litres of fluid from his body.

However,
 after several weeks he became stable enough to fly home, and was taken 
to Harefield Hospital in north-west London. ‘I was told I had picked up a
 virus which attacked my heart and caused it to inflame, which is 
incredibly rare,’ he said.

Staff fitted him with a cardiac 
resynchronisation therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) to moderate the pace of 
his heart. ‘

I was 
eventually able to leave the hospital and was at home for seven weeks, 
but I collapsed at Tesco and was taken back,’ he said.

Mr
 Britton then had eight hours of open heart surgery, and was fitted with
 a left ventricular assist device, which sucks in blood and sends it 
through the heart. He is now stable, and in hospital awaiting a heart 
transplant.

Before being struck down by the viral infection, Andrew had always had a passion for fitness - playing squash from a young age. Shortly before his wedding he had even attended a triathlon training camp in the Algarve. He is pictured in the hospital garden while he waits for a transplant

When Andrew was stable enough to get another medical flight home, he was taken to Harefield Hospital in London. There they fitted a Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Defibrillator device (pictured in his X-ray) to help pace his heart and within 48 hours he felt much better

Andrew (pictured shortly after his operation to fit a defibrillator) is now waiting for a heart transplant. He will have to live in hospital until he receives a new heart. Lauren visits him every day after work and the couple have dinner together

His wife, a
 recruitment consultant, visits him every day after work with dinner, 
which they eat together. The couple are now urging people to register as
 organ donors to help people like them.

‘Despite
 all that has happened, I count myself lucky,’ Mr Britton said. ‘I have 
an amazing family, and met people who show the world is full of people 
that care for strangers.’

When
 he regains full health, he hopes to become squash champion at the World
 Transplant Games – the Olympics for transplant recipients.
