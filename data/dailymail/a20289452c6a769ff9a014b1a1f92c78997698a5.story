A 78-year-old woman died after her emergency pendant went unanswered for five hours.

Her frantic midnight calls from the panic button round her neck were missed by Bexley Emergency Link Line (Bell) because only one worker was on duty, and he had been logged out of the system.

It was not until five hours later, just before 6am on April 6 last year, that the council employee logged back in again. By this time Mrs Baker was dead.

A former telecoms engineer who used 
to install the systems for Bexley Council claims he warned bosses such 
an incident could happen back in 2007.

Her calls from Meadows Court 
sheltered housing complex, in Sidcup, went through to the 
lone operator at Bexley Civic Centre but he missed it, causing the 
computer system to log him out of 'call receiving mode' after three 
minutes.

A post-mortem concluded Mrs Baker died of natural causes but it was not attributed to the lack of response to her alarm and there was no inquest.

Telecoms engineer John Cousins, 54, said a single person should never have been left in charge of the system.

He
added CCTV staff who used to be on the same corridor as the Bell 
operators and would cover for them when needed were moved elsewhere in 
2010.

He said: 'Why gamble on having one operator? To me it's just reckless having one person working on a particular night.

'The
weakest link should always be the customer not wearing their pendant, 
not the council having just one member of staff on because they can't 
afford more.

'I was paranoid about the safety of the clients and I tried my best to update the system and bring it into the 21st Century.'

Mr Cousins, of Bexleyheath, says the operator was promising but was inexperienced and had not been trained to deal with the situation he was confronted with.

The operator was immediately sacked, though a police investigation found insufficient evidence to charge him with any crime.

Mr Cousins was himself fired in July last year over an unrelated case of 'gross misconduct', though he feels he was forced out by the council over the incident with Mrs Baker.

Bexley Council in south-east London, which operates the 24-hour response system, has apologised 'unreservedly' to the family of Barbara Baker.

However, it claims Mr Cousins did not alert the council about problems prior to Mrs Baker's death.

The council said: 'Following a post-mortem examination, it was concluded Mrs Baker died of natural causes.

'The lack of response by Bell was not an attributable factor in Mrs Baker's death, and the case did not progress to an inquest.

'The Bell staff and managers were very upset this incident happened and the council has apologised unreservedly to Mrs Baker's sister for the distress it caused.'

'Mr Cousins was not party to this incident and is speculating on a situation while not being in possession of the full facts.

'He did not alert managers, prior to the incident, that there could be a future issue.

'The operator on duty that night, an agency worker, has not been employed by the council since.

'The agency worker had been given full training on the Bell system and had even been given extra, specific training on what to do should the system ever lock out.

'Due to the low workload, the system was previously monitored overnight by one operator.

'Now, if there is ever a time when there cannot be two members of staff available, the calls for the entire shift are all set to go to a central monitoring service instead.'
