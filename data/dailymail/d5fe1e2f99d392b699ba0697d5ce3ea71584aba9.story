Gary Neville believes Manchester United are several players short of having a squad capable of winning the Barclays Premier League this season.

After a disastrous campaign in which United finished seventh under David Moyes, new manager Louis van Gaal has brought Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera to Old Trafford.

But Neville insists they still need a right back and another midfielder before they can claim to be legitimate challengers.

New additions: Manchester United have brought Luke Shaw (left) and Ander Herrera this summer

'Unless two or three players come in I don't think it's realistic that he [Van Gaal] can win the league this year,' he told Sky Sports.

'Although there is a potential with what Liverpool did in the fact they had free weeks of Saturday to Saturday, continual perfect preparation. That's a big advantage for United if they get onto some momentum.

'In Chicharito, [Wayne] Rooney, [Robin] Van Persie and [Danny] Welbeck, they have still got, I think, probably the best strikers in the league as a pool.

'If they can get the back right and find a solution in midfield – [Michael] Carrick's out for two or three months so they need to sign another top midfield player – and stay injury-free then they do have a chance.'

United begin their Premier League campaign at home to Swansea on Saturday.
