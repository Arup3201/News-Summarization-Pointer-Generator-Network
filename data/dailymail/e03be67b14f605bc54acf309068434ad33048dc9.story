He may only be small, but this one-eyed dachshund has a huge amount of love to give to the woman who saved him from certain death.

Captain Morgan was reunited with Eva Armstrong, a director at Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue, a couple of months after she rescued him from a dog pound with a high-kill rate in Alabama.

The touching moment Captain Morgan snuggled into the shoulder of the woman who saved him at a reunion block party on May 5, has melted hearts across the world.

'The look on his face says it all,' one reader commented on BuzzFeed's post.

The New York rescue centre has rehomed more than 800 dogs from the South, where animals in rural pounds have a 90 per cent chance of being put down.

'Whenever any of us run into dogs 
that we have fostered or rescued, they always recognise us and are so 
excited to see us. Dogs remember the person who saved their life and 
helped them on their way to a forever home,' Sara Cross, founder of Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue, told the Huffington Post.

Captain Morgan, who has been renamed Cappy by his new owner, was rescued by Ms Armstrong and a group of volunteers at Badass on their last trip to Alabama.

Usually the rescue centre arranges to have saved dogs driven to foster homes in and around New York City, but Ms Armstrong was so taken with the tiny dog that she brought him back herself.

'We don't travel very often to the South,' Ms Cross said. 'But 
we did a trip to visit the local volunteers at two of the shelters we 
rescue from. When we were down there we met and of course fell in love 
with Cappy and brought him back in our van'

He was named Captain Morgan because of 
his one good eye and the dog, who was initially rescued by Shannon Lynch,
spent his first night of freedom snuggled up on Ms Armstrong's hotel 
bed.

Cappy stayed with Ms Armstrong at her farmhouse in Pennsylvania until he was ready to be rehomed in Brooklyn.

At the Alabama pound Cappy was saved from, 97 per cent of the dogs that find themselves there are killed.

Some
of the dog pounds that Badass volunteers search, in the hope of giving 
the healthy dogs a second chance, use methods such as gas chambers to 
put the animals down.

Ms Cross said: 'Cappy would not be alive were it not for a small group of dedicated volunteers in Selma, Alabama.'

She added: 'We would not even know these dogs exist, let alone be able to rescue them, if it were not for amazing volunteers.'

The dedicated volunteers devote their time and energy to photographing dogs in the county pounds, posting the pictures to Facebook, testing the temperament of the dogs and dealing with government officials and shelter directors to have the animals released.

Being freed from the pound is the just the first step in a long journey for the dogs.

The volunteers who rescue them foster them in the South until they are physically and emotionally ready to move to New York to be rehomed.

Unlike some rescue shelters, Badass does not have a rehoming centre. Instead, a network of volunteers are relied on to foster dogs and prepare them for living in a home environment, before suitable owners are found.

As well as relying on a community of dedicated volunteers who vow to never give up on a dog in their care,Â Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue survives on donations.

The group is always looking for volunteers and potential new owners. It posts updates on the dogs and their progress on its Facebook page at Badass Brooklyn Foster Dog.
