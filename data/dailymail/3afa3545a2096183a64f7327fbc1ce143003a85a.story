There are worse places to be on a Monday morning. 

I'm watching grazing deer while dipping a solider into a freshly laid boiled egg.  Soon, I'm going to pull on my wellies have a totter around the vegetable garden and pet some pigs.

If it sounds as though I'm living an episode of The Good Life, it's because I am.

I'm at The Pig Near Bath, a relatively new hotel in the rolling Mendip Hills in Somerset.

The Pig near Bath: Georgian Grade II manor is owned by Robin Hutson (previously of the Hotel du Vin chain)

Otherwise known as Hunstrete House, it is one of the latest period properties to come under The Pig namesake, known for freshly picked kitchen garden cooking and a  locally sourced menu. 

Owner Robin Hutson (previously of the Hotel du Vin chain) bought, renovated and reopened the hotel in March as the third in a litter of four similar venues.

Billed as a 'restaurant with rooms' the Pig near Bath's emphasis is on home grown  food

Even if you aren't a foodie you may have heard of it. The hotel made headlines last June when a group of celebrities retired here after Glastonbury. 

They were a starry lot. Bryan Ferry, Kelis, Daisy Lowe, Alexa Chung, Sadie Frost, Sam Smith and Caroline Flack all made the 30-mile trip from the festival to play croquet, sleep, eat and party some more.

But it's not just a rehab for party goers. Billed as a 'restaurant with rooms', the Pig near Bath's emphasis is firmly on food.

Local produce: 80 per cent of what is on the menu comes from from within a 25-mile radius

According to Tom Ross, the hotel’s director, 80 per cent of what’s on the plate - if it hasn’t come from less than 25 metres away in the walled garden - is sourced from within a 25-mile radius.

‘The garden is the heartbeat of the hotel,’ he says   showing me around a walled garden with vegetable patches, fruit cages,  greenhouses and nearby poly tunnels.

While the concept is not ground-breakingly new or unique, they do it well here. 

As we walk he picks white strawberries for me to taste (they taste like red ones but less sickly sweet), three varieties of spinach are produced with a magician's flourish and twelve types of chili pointed out. Twelve!

We pass bushes of kale the size of a baby elephant, patches of chard, spinach, pickles, beetroot, cucumber plants, cranberries, loganberries and apple trees. The gardeners even cultivated watermelons this summer.

There are  pigs for petting at the bottom of the garden, and some reared for eating nearby. ‘We don’t name them,’ Tom says rather ominously.

He introduces me to chickens (for eggs), quails (likewise) and a sprawling 20 acres of woodland and deer park that surrounds the property for  100  deer.

The Georgian Grade II manor house is rustically charming yet smart and offbeat with giant mounted boar’s heads and velvet sofas. Rows of colourful Hunter wellies for guests to use line the front door and log fires permanently rage.

Vegetables by the bucket load: The walled garden has fruit cages, greenhouses and nearby poly tunnels too

Rooms start at £139 and rise to £250 a night. There are 29 in all and ours was vast with two large armchairs, a roll top freestanding bath and a four-poster bed. 

At £199, the cost was stomachable, especially compared with overpriced Bath (where smaller rooms can cost £1,000), and the small things are done well.

Interiors have been ‘piggified’ by Robin’s wife Judy, which means an oxymoron of smart shabbiness. Like the food, the decorations are homely and hearty. Our ‘Big Comfy Luxe’ room had framed pressings of ferns, organic Bamford products (also stocked at Liberty) and books on how to make pigeon casserole.

Everything revolves around food: The menu  changes daily depending on what's been picked from the garden

For dinner I ate honey roast carrot and beetroot salad, pan fried breast of guinea fowl with  sprouting broccoli and  cabbage. Most of it had been in the ground barely hours earlier.

The kitchen is overseen by chef Kamil Oseka and the food that comes out is seriously good and devoid of  pretension. They smoke all their own venison, salt, butter, ham, pancetta and salmon.

Downstairs is a library stocked with Penguin Classics, a beautiful bar, billiards room and various spaces for, as they put it, ‘gathering and quaffing’. On the subject, a popular sharpener is the house chili or raspberry infused vodka, which was spot on. 

For the slovenly, there are two Potting Shed spa rooms.  Tucked at the bottom of the walled garden, they are simple and efficient - if built as a bit of an after thought.

The Potting Shed: Rather than a traditional spa the hotel has two modest sheds for treatments

Lying on a heated bed I was rubbed with rosemary oil and kneaded like bread. Surrounded by pots of growing beetroot, scented candles and hanging pitchforks it was not the usual sanitised spa-experience but all the better for it.

So what of the future? Tom says there are plans for another Pig hotel possibly in Kent, Sussex or the Cotswolds, but it depends on finding the right property. ‘Hopefully we’ll get some bees for honey soon and I’m set on introducing a pet pig, like a dog, to the house’ 

That depends on owner Robin Hutson. At the moment Robin presides over three other 'The Pig' hotels; one in The New Forest, another in Southampton and the last little piggy which opened last May, The Pig on the Beach in Dorset.

The Pig near Bath is fully booked every weekend from now until June so if you want a go at the trough, you’ll have to try Sunday nights, midweek or a trip for lunch or dinner.
