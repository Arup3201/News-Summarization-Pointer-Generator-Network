A group pushing for Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2016 has started selling merchandise to the masses.

The political action campaign Ready For Hillary was started by supporters and has not been formally connected or endorsed by the former Secretary of State.

That hasn't stopped them from advertising three pages of products on sale at their website ranging for every kind of supporter.

Those who take fashion cues from the former First Lady can use lapel pins to show their support.

Pricey product: The most expensive item is the Ready For Hillary tool kit tote bag, on sale for $60

Meme aficionados will recognize the iPhone case with the picture of her that was used on 'Texts From Hillary' on the back.

Keeping mum: The former Secretary of State has not yet made a formal announcement about whether or not she will run for president in 2016

Newborn? No problem. They've got a onesie for that.

Tool kit tote bags, silver medals, champagne glasses and cocktail napkins are all  for sale on the PAC's website, with prices that range from $4 for buttons to $60 for the large tote bag.

Making sure not to miss a chance to drive the message home, items like t-shirts and water bottles are symbolically priced at $20.16.

The group has stuck to at least one traditional publicity tactic by offering free bumper stickers to people who subscribe to their email notifications.

The merchandise is just their latest fundraising step, but they have been been accepting donations since January 2013 when she stepped down from her post as Secretary of State.

The Center for Responsive Politics reports that they have raised a total of $4.1million already.

Some of her close advisors at first thought that the PAC could be damaging if they were off their official message, but it seems that others have begun to embrace the group- monetarily.

Former U.S. Ambassador Elizabeth Bagley, who was appointed to her post in Portugal by Hillary’s husband Bill Clinton in 1994, donated $5,000 to the group.

The biggest donations came from Scott Bessent, the CIO of George Soros’ investment firm, who pledged $25,000 to the cause. That 70s Show creator Bonnie Turner followed suit with $10,000 of her own. 

Political heavyweights have even begun putting their money towards the cause, with American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten donating $1,000.

Harold Ickes, a Democratic strategist and head of progressive Priorities USA PAC, donated $2,500 even though his group will likely end up backing Clinton as well.

The money will come in handy if Clinton formally announces her (widely presumed) candidacy as the latest polls have her as the clear leader of the Democratic field.

The latest RealClearPolitics poll average for the Iowa Democratic caucus has Clinton 55 points ahead of the field, which includes Vice President Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Governor Andrew Cuomo.
