Michigan hip-hop group Insane Clown Posse are suing the Justice Department and the FBI, claiming their fans were classified by the government as gang members and then unlawfully harassed by police, leading to 'significant harm.'

The suit, filed Wednesday in Federal District Court in Detroit, accuses the government of making the 'unwarranted and unlawful decision' to issue a National Gang Threat dubbing the fans a 'loosely organized hybrid gang.' It is being jointly filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan.

Singers Joseph Utsler and Joseph Bruce, who go by the names Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J, paint their faces to look like clowns and are known for their 'controversial, rebellious and provocative' music that often uses harsh themes and language, according to the lawsuit.

Angry: The rap metal group sued the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday over a 2011 FBI report that describes the duo's devoted fans, the Juggalos, as a dangerous gang, saying the designation has tarnished their fans' reputations and hurt business

Many of the duo's estimated 1 million fans, known as Juggalos, also paint their faces to look like clowns and display a logo of a hatchet man on their clothes and jewelry.

'Branding hundreds of thousands of music fans as gang members based on the acts of a few individuals defies logic and violates our most cherished of constitutional rights,' Michael Steinberg, ACLU's legal director in Michigan, said in a statement.

The gang designation has caused the Juggalos 'significant harm, including repeated police harassment and denial of employment,' according to the complaint.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of four Juggalos and Utsler and Bruce.

FBI report: The FBI report from 2011 shows a picture of a Juggalo holding a gun and describes fans as 'a loosely-organized hybrid gang'

It accuses the Justice Department and
 FBI of violating the fan's First Amendment rights and collecting 
information on the group without suspicion of criminal activity.

The suit refers to the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment, in which the Justice Department said Juggalos were a loosely organized hybrid gang.

The government's assessment showed a photo of what appears to be a female Juggalo, with a painted clown face, aiming a pistol. The report said most crimes committed by Juggalos were sporadic and involved assault, drugs, theft and vandalism.

A small number of Juggalos were forming more organized subsets and engaging in more gang-like criminal activity, such as felony assaults, thefts, robberies and drug sales, the assessment said.

Fan: Brandon Bradley, 20, of Sacramento, California, wears a necklace with a man carrying a hatchet, an Insane Clown Posse symbol, as he described being unfairly harassed by police

ACLU: Michael J. Steinberg, legal director for ACLU of Michigan, center, announced the ACLU-filed lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department  Wednesday

One self-identified Juggalo, Brandon Bradley, 20, 'has on numerous occasions been stopped and detained by law enforcement officers in California,' the ACLU said in a statement.

'Each time, the officer has wrongly accused Brandon of being in a gang and has interrogated him about being a Juggalo and his affiliated tattoos and clothing. Another client, Scott Gandy, was told he would not be accepted in the Army because his ICP tattoo was a gang symbol.'

The Insane Clown Posse, whose website shows photos of Utsler and Bruce in black-and-white-painted clown faces and sporting tattoos on their hands and forearms, said in a statement posted on their website that its legal counsel and the ACLU 'think that the discrimination, profiling and harassment that Juggalos have been facing over the last few years in (sic) flat out WRONG and un-American.'

The Justice Department in Detroit was not immediately available for comment.
