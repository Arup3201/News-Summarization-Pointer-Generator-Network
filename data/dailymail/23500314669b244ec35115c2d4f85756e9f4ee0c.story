According to detectives, a 2001 Nissan driven by a 17-year-old Tristan Reichle was traveling westbound when the vehicle crossed into the eastbound lanes and struck a GMC Suburban operated by a 53-year-old man.

There were five people inside, two of whom were ejected. Four victims died immediately after the accident, while the fifth died at the hospital the next day.

Prosecutors allege that Gloe stopped at a red light in the lane next to Reichle, challenging him to a race several times. When the traffic signal turned green, the two cars crossed Route 110 and were racing each other westbound on Conklin Street when Reichle lost control.

Reichle was killed in the crash along with 18-year-old Jesse Romero, 14-year-old Carly Lonborg and 15-year-old Noah Francis. Cody Talanian, 17, was pronounced dead at 10 p.m. the following evening at Nassau University Medical Center.

High schoolers: All five teens who were riding in this 2001 Nissan were from Farmingdale High School

Disbelief: The families of the teens awoke to the awful news on Mother's Day 2014

All five victims attended Farmingdale High School, though one was a former student.

'Today's indictment is the result of an event that brought heartbreak to these families, the innocent victims who were injured, and the Farmingdale community since last May,' Acting District Attorney Madeline Singas said.

 'Unfortunately nothing will alleviate the pain or bring back the lives lost in this senseless crash. 

We owe it to our kids and everyone on our roads to remember that speed and racing kill. 

As parents, grandparents and teachers we cannot emphasize enough to our kids that when you are old enough to drive a car, you are also old enough to be held responsible for your decisions behind the wheel.' 

Gloe's attorney Stephen LaMagna insists his client will be acquitted, calling the incident 'unbelievably tragic,' and noted Gloe's vehicle was not involved in the actual crash.

'My client did not cause this accident in anyway and in any form,' LaMagna said.

'My client, his family, have been heartbroken as well as the rest of the community over what happened 9 months ago.

Unfortunately many times in tragedies such as these, invariably the district attorney's office has a need to blame somebody , anybody whether or not that person was truly responsible for this tragedy.'
