One two year old boy and a 9-month-old rescue dog share something in common. They both have a rare brain condition and now they're both best friends.

Dylan, 2, and Frank the dog both have something called hydrocephalus, a condition that causes excessive fluid in the brain to accumulate and causes the skull to expand.

The Huffington Post reports that young Dylan has already had to undergo 15 brain surgeries.

After meeting for the first time, the dog and the boy became fast friends

Dylan's mother, India Lipton, would frequently take her son to the Children's Hospital of Richmand at Virginia Commonwealth University for his medical treatments.

Coincidentally, Frank's owner Stacy Metz is an administrative assistant at the hospital's Department of Neurology.

Due to Frank's brain condition, Frank suffered a seizure when he was eight months old and risked being put down.

Frank's owner Stacy Metz wanted to give the dog another chance.

'We really didn't hesitate [to adopt Frank] because we are fully aware of the condition,' Metz told HuffPost. 'We wanted the little guy to get a chance on life.'

When Lipton found out that Stacey Metz had adopted a dog with the same brain condition that her son has, she immediately reached out to Metz so that the pair could meet.

Dylan and Frank met on February 8. at the Richmond Animal League where Metz adopted Frank in August.

'It was a toddler and a puppy,' India Lipton told HuffPost.

'And a whole lot of energy,' she continued.

'To know a dog that has the same condition as Dylan, it'll be just amazing to see them grow up together,' Lipton said.

Frank is in training to become a service dog and his mom hopes that he will be able to help more children like Dylan. Frank already has his own large group of adoring facebook fans.
