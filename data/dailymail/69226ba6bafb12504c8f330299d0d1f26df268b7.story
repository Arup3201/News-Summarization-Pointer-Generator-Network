George Bailey has stepped down as Australia's Twenty20 captain to focus on the longer formats of cricket.

Bailey led the Baggy Greens in 28 T20 internationals after succeeding Cameron White as skipper at the start of 2012, and has quit to concentrate on next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and also earn a Test recall.

The 32-year-old has not given up playing T20 cricket for his country but will not be available for the one-off encounter against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in October, or the three games against South Africa in November

End of an era: Bailey has been the Australian T20 captain for 28 matches since 2012

Calling the shots: Bailey has an average of 26.11 in the shortest form of the game 

Bailey will continue to lead the Hobart Hurricanes in the KFC T20 Big Bash League and Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab, as well as play first-class cricket for Tasmania.

'I've thoroughly enjoyed the responsibility and honour of leading Australia in T20 internationals,' he said.

'Over the last couple of months I have had the opportunity to reflect on my role as T20 captain and the direction I want to take my cricket over the next few years.

'Personally, I want to focus on my one-day cricket as well as becoming the best long-form player I can to give myself the very best chance to play Test cricket again.

'Stepping down from the T20 captaincy allows me the option of not playing some T20 international matches so I can play more four-day cricket for Tasmania this side of Christmas.

Leader: Bailey will continue to play ODI cricket for his country but won't captain in the shortest form

'With that in mind and also an eye to the future and the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, I consider this to be a good time to step down from the captaincy and allow a new captain the chance to settle into the role.

'I have had numerous discussions with Cricket Australia and they have been very supportive of my decision.'

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland praised Bailey's efforts during his two-and-a-half-year stint in charge.

'George is a fine leader and will certainly leave big shoes to fill as Australia's T20 captain,' Sutherland said.

Big test: The batsman has played five Test matches for his country and wants more long-form cricket

'I'd like to thank him for his efforts in captaining the country in the shortest form of the game. He is an excellent ambassador for Australian cricket, displaying great leadership and setting a positive example for younger players around the country.'

Bailey scored 470 runs since making his T20 debut against India in 2012 at an average of 26.11.

CA will name a new T20 captain in due course.
