A promising future AFL star has quit the game because of the horrific racial abuse he received on the field.

The son of indigenous AFL legend Che Cockatoo-Collins is walking away from the sport despite being a potential top-10 draft pick in the AFL, according to his father.

Under-14 player Sachem was allegedly called a 'n*****' by an umpire and told to 'watch his back'.

His father Che, who played 85 games with Essendon and 75 with Port Adelaide from 1994-2003, is now considering making a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Anti-Discrimination Commission Queensland.

The sickening attack from the official was followed by taunts on social media.

'I was angry, yelling and crying,' Che said of his reaction to his son's attack, which happened last year.

'As parents we still feel guilty we were not there to protect our son,' he told The Sunday Mail.

Sachem, who stands at more than 183cm tall and played for Brisbane club side Redland, was named best afield in last year's grand final.

He has been described as one of Queensland's 'key attacking weapons'.

However, he handed in his jumper after playing out the year.

Che has spoken out about the incident now because he feels the issue has essentially been washed over.

The umpire is back officiating at games after just a two-week ban.

Che has asked advice from fellow Essendon player and human rights activist Michael Long and the AFL's Jason Mifsud.

'AFL Queensland took the issue very seriously and an independent investigation resulted in a number of actions against the club and those involved,' former Fitzroy player Michael Conlan, who is now the AFL Queensland chief executive, said.

Che has two younger sons, Stirling, 8, and Preston, 10, who he says 'look up to their big brother'.

The family live on North Stradbroke Island, Queensland, and all three boys dabble in sports including AFL, rugby league and basketball.

Sachem is also said to be 'very good' at basketball.

Che has spoken out about the racist attack at the same time that AFL is celebrating its Indigenous Round.

The round of games aims to recognise the contribution of Indigenous people and culture to the broader Australian society.

Despite attempts to stamp out racism in the game, in 2013, an AFL match between Collingwood and Sydney was marred by a racial taunt from a young supporter at Sydney's Indigenous star Adam Goodes.

Swans star and Australian of the Year Adam Goodes has been on the front foot against racism, having been subjected to a number of disgusting attacks over the past 12 months

However, Essendon great Michael Long believes AFL spectators are now getting behind the fight against racism in football.

Long, who has been battling racial equality in the game for 10 years, believes the footy-going public is starting to get the message.

'You see the supporters are getting behind it. They're not accepting it, they're not accepting hearing this type of language at the football,' Long told the ABC's AM.

'The fight against it is only just, I think, strengthening.'
