The fisherman who says he drifted at sea for more than a year said it was 'faith in God' that pulled him through - and he maintained that he didn't eat his friend who was swept away with him.

Jose Salvador Alvarenga, 37, appeared strong and walked without help as he left San Rafeal hospital in Salvador yesterday, but also seemed disoriented and had trouble speaking.

He was embraced by his parents at a press conference to mark his discharge, where he said he didn't plan to tell his story because he had no wish to remember his ordeal.

Salvador, yesterday

'I always had faith that I was going 
to survive, asking (God) every day and every night,' he said. 'I never 
lost faith that one day I would be found.'

Asked
 about the fate of his fishing companion, Ezequiel Cordova, 22, he said 
the younger man lived four months in the boat before succumbing to 
starvation and exposure.

Mr Alvarenga has said that he lived on fish, turtles and birds and that Mr Cordova had difficulty eating the raw flesh.

Asked if he had eaten Mr Cordova to survive, Mr Alvarenga answered with an emphatic 'No'.

'He died of starvation and the sun,' Mr Alvarenga said.

He
added that Mr Cordova's parents shouldn't worry for their son because he died
 praying to God: 'The whole time he was asking for forgiveness.'

Mr
 Alvarenga's story stunned the world when he washed up on a Pacific 
atoll several weeks ago, seemingly robust and barely sunburned.

But he 
turned out to be swollen, dehydrated and in pain from the ordeal.

He
 has said he came close to giving up hope of being rescued after several
 large ships came near his small fishing boat but none tried to rescue 
him, even though sailors on at least one even waved at him.

wouldn't go home permanently

Medical
 staff have been amazed by his physical condition after traveling 6,500 
miles in a small fishing boat from Mexico to the Marshall Islands. He 
was believed lost in a storm while fishing off the coast of Mexico.

He seems mentally well, doctors said yesterday, although he is afraid of the sea.

'He
 doesn't exhibit grave mental disorders like we feared, such as problems
 with thinking or perceptions,' said Dr Fredy Sermeno, a psychiatrist.

The
 medical team that examined him at San Rafael Hospital in El Salvador's 
capital said he was in remarkably good physical health, with no skin 
lesions from overexposure to the sun and no cardiovascular or kidney 
issues.

His only physical problem was anaemia, doctors said.

Salvadoran
 experts who looked at Mr Alvarenga's results said they didn't doubt the
 veracity of his tale, which left many people sceptical, even without 
any alternate explanation for his appearance on the Ebon atoll.

A
 man with his nickname, 'Cirilo,' had been registered as missing with 
civil defense officials in the village. The officials said a small 
fishing boat carrying two men, the other named Ezequiel Cordova, 
disappeared during bad weather on November 17, 2012, and no trace of 
them or the craft was found during an intense two-week search.

Mr Alvarenga asked to be given as much privacy as possible amid international media excitement over his story.

He
 will was set today to make a brief visit to his hometown, the fishing 
village of Garita Palmera, but then return to San Salvador.

He said he couldn't return home permanently, but didn't know where he would go.
