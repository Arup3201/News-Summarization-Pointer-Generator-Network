Chocolate retailer Thorntons dealt a further blow to the High Street today by announcing plans to close up to 180 stores.

The struggling store will close 120 outlets over three years in another high-profile retail slump following the recent failures of Habitat, Jane Norman, TJ Hughes and Oddbins.

Thorntons, which celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, will close the stores as their leases expire, and is considering the future of 60 other outlets.

Strugging: Thorntons bosses said the chocolate maker announced the store closures to cope with 'challenging trading conditions'

Jane Norman closed its doors on Saturday before it was put into administration yesterday

There was some relief from the latest 
High Street gloom as sofa giant DFS defied the slump by 
announcing plans for eight new stores.

The group, which operates 80 stores, announced a 3.1 per cent rise in underlying profits after increasing its share of the furniture market.

The closures by Thorntons, however, will leave the chocolate maker with around
180 to 200 company-owned stores, although in the majority of locations 
it hopes franchisees will open outlets.

The closure of the stores could put between 750 and 1,125 jobs at risk, but the company said it would try to find staff alternative roles wherever possible.

It is the latest blow to the high street after the failure of chains such as Habitat and Oddbins in recent weeks and Jane Norman yesterday.

Discount department store TJ Hughes is set to join the list of failed retailers today after it reportedly filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator.

Chains such as HMV, Game and JJB Sports, which have long been the mainstay of UK high streets, are also slimming down their store estates.

And Mothercare said recently that it would axe 110 shops in order to focus its trading on out-of-town locations.

The Thorntons strategy review, led by new chief executive Jonathan Hart, will see the company increasingly focus on its commercial division, which sells Thorntons-branded chocolate through other retailers, and grow online sales.

The review also aims to make the business less dependent on seasonal events such as Christmas and Easter by increasing the number of gifts it sells

Mr Hart said the strategy was the 
right one because he sees the current weakness in high street footfall 
and consumer sentiment continuing.

Carpetright
today reported a 70% slide in full-year profits and warned it will 
close more stores in an effort to weather the consumer downturn.

The
floor coverings specialist said profits reduced to £6.6 million in the 
year to April 30 after householders were put off making major purchases 
and also found it harder to obtain mortgages in order to move home.

Sales in the UK and Ireland fell nearly 5% to £404.5 million in the year.

The
group finished the period with 559 stores in the UK and Ireland, after 
closing a net figure of 27, and said that, with leases on 94 stores due 
to expire in the next five years, it expected to further reduce the size
of its estate.

Lord Harris, Carpetright's chairman and chief executive described trading conditions as 'very challenging'.

The
review said its stores needed an overhaul after a recent lack of 
investment and changes in shopper behaviour, as they visit the high 
street less regularly in favour of supermarkets and internet shopping.

Although
it still thinks its own stores will remain an important part of its 
future, it said selling through other retailers will become its main 
sales channel over the next three years.

It
will revamp its products with gifts for under £5 for special occasions 
such as birthdays and anniversaries to help broaden its appeal 
throughout the year and will develop a new flagship boxed chocolate 
brand next year. It will start offering free tastings in-stores in the 
next couple of months.

The group also aims to make efficiency savings at its factories and supply chain in a bid to save £2 million a year.

However, closing the company-owned stores will cost it between £4.2 million and £4.8 million.

Elsewhere, department store chain TJ Hughes joined the increasing ranks of struggling high street brands when it today announced it would be appointing an administrator in the next 10 days.

The move by the Liverpool-based chain, which runs 57 stores, could put 4,000 jobs at risk.

TJ Hughes was bought out by its management team in March following reports that it had been hit by the withdrawal of credit insurance for its suppliers following a difficult period of trading.

The homewares sector has suffered heavy sales declines in recent weeks as nervous consumers put off purchases of big-ticket items such as fridges and TVs.

Women's
fashion firm Jane Norman became another big high street name to fall 
into administration yesterday in a move which could put up to 1,600 jobs
at risk.

Accountancy firm Zolfo Cooper hopes to find a buyer for the stricken retailer, which closed its 90 stores on Saturday.

Habitat:Thirty
stores outside London put into administration. Around 900 jobs 
threatened. Homebase and Argos owner, Home Retail Group, bought the 
rights to the Habitat brand in the UK, the webstie and three stores in 
central London for £24.5million.

HomeForm:

About
3,000 jobs at risk across 160 showrooms, including 1,500 fitters and 
designers. The private equity owned business is behind Moben kitchens, 
bathroom chain Dolphin and Sharps bedrooms. Administrators were called 
in last week.

All Saints:Fashion
chain on the brink of administration until Lion Capital stepped in. 
Lion owns La Senza and American Apparel and the deal secures undreds of 
jobs in 63 stores and 47 concessions in the UK, Europe, US and Russia. 
Badly affected by Icelandic banking crisis as Glitnir and Kaupthing held
significant stakes.

Focus DIY:Ernst
& Young launched a closing down sale in May as it moved to shut 123
stores out of the company's 178-strong store estate. The administrator 
earlier managed to find buyers for 55 stores, including to Wickes owner 
Travis Perkins, but the collapse of the chain left more than 3,000 
workers facing redundancy.

Oddbins:The
wine merchant was the latest victim of a declining independent wine 
trade in the UK, which also saw Threshers' owner, First Quench 
Retailing, collapse in 2009. Oddbins had hoped to push through a rescue 
deal but HM Revenues & Customs, which was owed £8 million by the 
chain, refused to vote for the scheme. Whittals Wine Merchants bought 37
Oddbins stores, securing more than 200 store jobs, but this left a 
further 52 stores in the hands of administrators Deloitte.

JJB Sports:The
sportswear chain was saved from administration after landlords and 
creditors backed its second rescue deal in as many years. JJB's latest 
company voluntary arrangement involved closing 43 unprofitable stores, 
placing a further 46 under review and a move to monthly rental payments.
The deal enabled it to raise £65 million from investors and secure a 
new banking facility.

HMV:The
sale of its Waterstone's book chain for £53 million has been key to 
HMV's survival as the deal with Russian investor Alexander Mamut enabled
the high street retailer to negotiate a two-year extension to lending 
facilities with its banks. HMV, which has around 260 stores in the UK 
and Ireland, is now working on a plan to reduce its estate and focus 
more on gadgets such as iPads.

Mothercare:Mothercare
unveiled plans in May to close 110 outlets and focus on out-of-town 
superstores. Rents will be cut on a further 40 stores, squeezing incomes
for high street landlords even further. The new focus will be on 
out-of-town Parenting Centres, which contain its Early Learning Centre 
brand.

Media
reports have suggested that Jane Norman could be sold imminently in a 
so-called pre-pack administration deal, with department store chain 
Debenhams and knitwear firm Edinburgh Woollen Mill reported to be among 
the potential bidders.

Jane Norman closed its doors on Saturday before it was put into administration yesterday.

Pre-pack administrations are controversial because creditors, such as suppliers, can lose out as some of the debts are scrapped.

Jane
Norman, which specialises in selling to women between the ages of 16 
and 25, is the latest retail victim of the squeeze in consumer spending 
brought about the financial crisis.

Around 1,600 jobs are at risk as a result of the collapse of Jane Norman

The
company, founded in London in 1952, has failed to find a buyer in 
recent weeks but putting the company into administration may speed up 
the sale process because some of its £140 million debts could be 
scrapped.

Jane Norman has 
been squeezed in recent months as cash-strapped consumers put off 
non-essential purchases and consumer confidence plunged amid fears over 
the strength of the economic recovery.

Clothes
have also become more expensive as raw materials such as cotton have 
soared in price, and VAT rose to 20% from 17.5% in January.

Debenhams, which operates most of the Jane Norman concessions, could be interested in buying the stock and brand.

Knitwear
firm Edinburgh Woollen Mill has a record of turning around troubled 
companies after it bought 77 stores from the administrators for textiles
business Rosebys in November 2008.

They were merged with the assets of furnishings business Ponden Mill to create the 150-strong Ponden home chain.
