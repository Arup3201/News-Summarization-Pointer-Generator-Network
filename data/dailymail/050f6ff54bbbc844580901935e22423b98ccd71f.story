Kim Kardashian's got one of the biggest bottoms in show business, but fitness guru Jen Selter is trying to her best to outdo her.

The 20-year-old New Yorker, who famously convinced Barbara Walters to do squats on live TV earlier this year, has amassed almost three million Instagram followers after posting daily poses of herself working out in tight-fitting gym gear - her shapely derriere being the primary focus.

In a picture posted on Monday her hourglass silhouette is captured from the side as she climbs into the pool wearing a tiny bikini to do some laps.

Hold that pose: Amply-bottomed Jen Selter, 20, from New York, has amassed almost three million Instagram followers after posting daily poses of herself in tight-fitting gym gear - she uploaded this shot on Monday

Just the day before she was snapped in Central Park doing yoga in the sun after spending the morning squatting in the gym.

But on Saturday it appears she took some time out from her jam-packed workout schedule as she is seen smiling for the camera at home.

However, she remains wearing her revealing gym gear, as to not let fans down.

Thanks to her constant parading, Miss Selter landed a lucrative sports management 
deal in January causing her to be dubbed the 'next Jillian Michaels.'

The 
pretty brunette is now set to make a small fortune through product 
endorsements and public appearances. Book, TV and fitness video projects
 are also in the pipeline.

'I
 see myself motivating and inspiring everyone around the world. With hard work and dedication, anyone can get to where I
 am'

Miss Selter signed with The Legacy Agency, 
which represents baseball stars Carl Crawford and ­Johan Santana, NFL 
players Osi Umenyiora and Reggie Bush and sports broadcasters Troy 
Aikman and Dan Hicks.

'We believe she can be the next Jillian Michaels,' TLA agent Andrew Witlieb told the New York Post, even though Miss Selter has no formal fitness training - unlike Michaels, 39, who is a judge on NBC’s The Biggest Loser.

However, Mr Witlieb pointed out: 'Jillian didn’t get to where she is until 
her mid-30s. Jen’s going to grow as a person, as a fitness expert, in 
these next years. She’s here for the long term.'

Asked if Miss Selter’s precious rear would be insured like the limbs of other top athletes, Mr Witlieb added, 'I have no idea.'

Just
 one picture of Miss Selter on a workout ball or squatting at the gym can garner
 as many as 200,000 likes, and thousands consider her a fitness 
inspiration.

'I don't really go to public gyms anymore 
just because it is a whole big scene when I'm there. I 
don't like being watched'

'I'm recognized wherever I am,' Miss Selter said. 'I don't really go to public gyms anymore 
just because it is a whole big scene when I'm there. I 
don't like being watched.'

She admits that her 
photos are always focused on her rounded behind, explaining: 'I don't 
really post a lot of face pictures... They don't want to see my face.'

Miss Selter,
 who is single and lives with her mother on the Upper West Side, took 
cosmetology classes while holding side jobs at a plastic surgeon's 
office and a gym after graduating high school.

When
 she started working out at the gym, she noticed that her behind began 
getting bigger and was inspired by the transformation.

She
 joined Instagram in March 2012 and began posting images of her body. 
When she saw people reposting her images, she asked for a credit and her
 number of followers boomed. 

Once she achieved 300,000 followers, 
sponsorship offers piled up from companies including Nike, Lululemon and
 New Balance, among others.

She has since quit her gym job and secured deals with water company NY20 and a nutrition supplement company, Game Plan Nutrition, for which she is a spokeswoman.

While
 she would not reveal how much she makes from these deals, Miss Selter, who 
did not go to college, said they give her 'a lot more money than a 
graduate would be making'.

Her mother, Jill Weinstein, said she couldn't be more proud of her daughter and her following.

'I'm
 very proud of her because this is a girl who didn’t want to go to 
college, and she was able to build up this social media in such a way 
that she has become famous and she is an inspiration and motivation for 
so many people,' she told the Post.

Many followers have suggested her 
plump derriere is fake - but she insists it is real, explaining that the
 only cosmetic surgery she has undergone was a nose job as a teenager.

'I'm Jewish,' she said. 'Jewish girls have big noses. Probably 1 out of 3 girls I know [has had] a nose job.'

Miss Selter,
 who hopes to create a line of workout gear or even her own chain of 
gyms, admits that some of the photos can be 'showy' - but said that she 
simply wants to inspire people.

'I
 see myself motivating and inspiring everyone around the world,' she concluded.

'With hard work and dedication, anyone can get to where I
 am.'
