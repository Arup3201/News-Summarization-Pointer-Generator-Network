This is the moment a canoe sinks to the bottom of a riverbed during a father-son bonding trip.

YouTube user 'mnsterbruiser' filmed the epic sailing fail take place on the Black River Falls in Wisconsin.

Footage captured by a body camera shows him sat behind his father as rapids throw the boat off balance, causing water to tip in. 

As the canoe rocks from side to side, it slowly starts dipping below the surface.

In little more than ten seconds, the vessel appears completely submerged.

Despite the accident, mnsterbruiser manages to retain a sense of humor.

In the film, he is heard laughing throughout - even when he is underwater.

Luckily the two oarsmen managed to make it to the riverbank and tip their canoe upside down.

They then continued on their journey, being more mindful to avoid the violent wash of the rapids.
