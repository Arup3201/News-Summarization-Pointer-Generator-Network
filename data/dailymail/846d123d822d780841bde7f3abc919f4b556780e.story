Owner Frank Gillespie’s magnificent 2014 Flat season has got even better after Louis The Pious carried his green silks to yet another big win with a two-and-three-quarter-length victory from Minalisa in the Ayr Gold Cup.

Irishman Gillespie has only six horses, split between north Yorkshire trainers Kevin Ryan and David O’Meara.

His Ryan-trained The Grey Gatsby has won two Group One races – the French Derby and Irish Champion Stakes – while O’Meara-trained That Is The Spirit landed a Listed race at the Epsom Derby meeting.

Now Louis The Pious, successful in the Buckingham Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, has added to that haul with Scotland’s biggest Flat race.

Success for the 10-1 shot also capped a fine day for jockey James Doyle, who had earlier landed the Ayr Silver Cup on Roger Charlton-trained Huntsmans Close and the QTS Nursery on Richard Hannon’s Power Play.

Louis The Pious had finished second in the Ayr Gold Cup 12 months ago. His win also continued the run of success at the meeting for horses drawn in high stands’ side starting stalls.

O’Meara, who two weeks earlier had landed his first Group One race with G Force in the Haydock Sprint Cup, said: ‘Sometimes he can run an indifferent kind of race but on his day he's very good, as we saw at Royal Ascot. These big-field handicaps bring the best out of him.’

Gillespie’s golden season might not be over yet.

The Grey Gatsby may face a re-match with Aidan O’Brien’s dual Derby Australia in the Champion Stakes at Ascot on October 18, providing Ryan does not feel the ground is too soft.

The score between the pair stands as 1-1 with The Grey Gatsby’s Irish Champion win avenging his defeat in the International Stakes at York.

A bad day for the bookmakers was compounded when Ralph Beckett-trained well-backed Air Pilot ran out a heavily-eased three and three-quarter length winner of the Dubai Duty Free Handicap at Newbury.

The Oisin Murphy-ridden 9-2 joint favourite could make a quick reappearance in next Saturday’s Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket but Beckett has warned he would not risk the fragile five-year-old on ground faster than Good.
