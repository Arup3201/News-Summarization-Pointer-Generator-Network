The Queen of Sweden has boycotted the prestigious Polar Music Prize awards ceremony due to the criminal past of one of the winners, U.S. rock legend Chuck Berry.

The 87-year-old rock pioneer was found guilty of human trafficking involving a 14-year-old girl in 1960, whom he was also accused of having a sexual relationship with.

Queen Silvia and her youngest daughter, Princess Madeleine of Sweden, both refused to attend the ceremony with the rest of the royal family, citing Berry’s conviction.

The Polar Music Prize is Sweden's most prestigious award for musicians, founded by the late ABBA manager Stig Anderson.

Winners Berry and American opera director Peter Sellars were announced in May this year and were honoured and awarded £87,000 (1million Swedish Kroner) at the prize ceremony on Tuesday.

Although King Carl XVI Gustaf and the Crown Princess Victoria both attended the ceremony, the Queen and Princess Madeleine were notably absent.

The Queen, the founder of children’s charity World Childhood Foundation which also employs Princess Madeleine, later explained that she had decided not to attend due to Berry’s previous conviction, and that she later went to a dinner to honour the second winner, Peter Sellars.

Unacceptable: The Queen said that as founder of children's charity World Childhood Foundation, she did not find it acceptable that she and Princess Madeleine attend a celebration of Chuck Berry

Royal decision: The Queen said her husband, King Carl XVI Gustaf and oldest daughter Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, both pictured with her husband Prince Daniel at the ceremony on Tuesday, respected her decision

‘I felt that it was not ok for me to 
be at the awards ceremony as there are so many people who believe in me,
 in World Childhood Foundation and in the princess [Madeleine],’ Queen 
Silvia told Expressen.

‘I did not do this for attention, I could not accept it,' 

‘It was a family decision and the King respects my opinions and understands the situation very well.’

In
 1959, Chuck Berry was arrested under the Mann Act for ’transporting an 
underage female across state lines for immoral purposes’.

He
 had met 14-year-old Janice Escalante in Mexico and took her to St 
Louis, promising her a job as a coat-check girl at his night-club, 
effectively taking her over three state lines.

Escalante, who allegedly also worked as a prostitute, claims she had a sexual relationshiop with Berry, something which the now 87-year-old has always denied.

He was convicted in March 1960, sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000 (£3,011), but appealed against the conviction on the grounds that the judge had been making racist comments, using the n-word to refer to Berry throughout the trial, and had prejudiced the jury against him.

After a second trial in 1961 the sentence was reduced to three years.  He served one-and-a-half years from February 1962 to October 1963.

Chuck Berry did not attend the Polar Music Prize ceremony this week, citing ill health.
