Coleen Rooney, Alex Gerrard, Victoria Beckham and Cheryl Cole may have been ridiculed for their high octane glamour when they landed in Baden Baden for the World Cup in 2006, but it seems the ladies of Liverpool are keen to uphold the WAG dress code. 

As the Liverpool football team emerged triumphant on the opening weekend of the season having beat Southampton 2-1 yesterday, it was their glossy girlfriends who garnered more attention.

Anfield was awash with pink hot pants, cleavage baring tops, Isabel Marant wedged trainers and studded Valentino stilettos courtesy of the WAGS.

All things bright and beautiful? Lucas Pezzini Leiva's wife Ariana commanded the most attention in her bold pink co-ords, which she accessorised with studded Valentino heels 

The WAG with perhaps the most eye-catching of outfits was Lucas Pezzini Leiva's wife Ariana.

Wearing vibrant pink shorts and matching cropped bolero teamed with a white shirt and studded Valentino heels, Ariana was clearly making the most of the last of the summer weather.

The blonde-haired model even coordinated her lipstick to her bold pink co-ords.

The Brazilian footballer and defensive midfielder's wife became notorious after a particular incident in 2012.

Lucas was left red-faced with embarrassment after his model wife called the police to check if he was OK after being substituted with a knee injury against Manchester City. 

All pink, everything! The blonde-haired model even coordinated her lipstick to her bold pink co-ords and made the most of the warmer August weather by getting her legs out

Aine Coutinho was also out to support her husband Philippe, a Brazilian footballer who plays for Liverpool as an attacking midfielder.

Wearing a slightly less garish outfit, the young WAG looked a little more casual in black cropped trousers and a leather look blazer. 

She did, however, stick to the WAG protocol with sky-high Christian Louboutin stilettos and a pair of dazzling drop diamond earrings. 

Having met and fallen in love very young, the 22-year-old credits his wife, whom he married in 2012, for his peace of mind (and perhaps his sense of style, too).

We can't work out who's more fashionable! Aine Coutinho joined husband Philippe, a Brazilian footballer who plays for Liverpool as an attacking midfielder, and gave him and his Gucci shows a run for their money in her sky-high Louboutins

Jesús Joaquín Fernández Sáez de la Torre, more commonly known as Suso, is a Spanish footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Premier League club Liverpool.

His partner gave the other WAGs a run for their money in the style stakes with her skin-tight black jeans, plunging blouse and towering red heels.

She accessorised her look with a thin gold belt and oversized animal print clutch. 

Rocking a more pared-back look, Jose Enrique's partner Amy Jaine looked chic in white trousers, a peach jumper and those famous Valentino studded shoes.

Adam Lallana's wife Emily Jubb recently gave birth to their baby boy and she opted for cool and casual style but was sure to jazz up her outfit with Isabel Marant trainers and a Chanel envelope clutch.

Adam went as far as to wed his 26-year-old fiancee six months early to avoid his wedding clashing with the World Cup.

The Southampton captain, who fathers their one-year-old son Arthumarried his girlfriend of seven years in a £500 ceremony at Poole Register Office in Dorset on Christmas Eve.
