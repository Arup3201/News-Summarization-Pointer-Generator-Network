Chancellor George Osborne has flown in the face of mounting rage at Royal Bank of Scotland's decision to award it boss a £1million bonus by claiming that it 'could have been worse for the taxpayer'.

To widespread fury, the taxpayer-owned bank awarded its Chief Executive Stephen Hester a bonus worth £963,000, more than many ordinary workers earn in a lifetime.

While the bank insists it has shown restraint - claiming its chief executive was 'entitled' to £1.5million - the decision has become a lightning rod for public disgust at the culture of rewards for failure.

Bonus: Royal Bank of Scotland's Stephen Hester was given £1m, despite a catalogue of failures and his decision to axe 3,500 jobs, but the decision was defended by the Chancellor George Osborne, right

Clear criticism is raining down from all corner; Labour leader Ed Miliband; London Mayor Boris Johnson; Bank of England Governor Mervyn King; Lib Dem Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne, trade unions and taxpayers watchdogs.

However, Osborne, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, came out in defence of the decision.

He excused the Government of blame but then claimed the £1m award was value for the taxpayer.

'I’ve always said that levels of pay across banking and financial services are too high,' he said.

'But this pay for Stephen Hester - the bonus - was set by the board of RBS under the arrangements that were put in place by the previous government, and of course Stephen Hester was the person brought in to sort out the mess at RBS after it collapsed.

'I think the important point for people to understand is that the alternatives would have been worse for the taxpayer.

'Either there would have been a much larger bonus, of the kind he would have got a few years ago.

'Or the British Government would have had to take over complete ownership of RBS and over-ruled the board, and I think that would have cost the taxpayer more as well.

Away days: Osborne's comments came while speaking at the World Economic Forum, which is taking place in the Swiss ski resort of Davos

'I understand people’s frustration about levels of pay across the banking sector, but the alternatives, when it came to Stephen Hester’s bonus, would have been worse for the taxpayer.'

RBS, which received a £45 billion state bailout, has seen its share price slump by 40 per cent, giving the taxpayer a paper loss of billions of pounds.

Osborne's comments come just days after ministers announced a crackdown on executive pay and David Cameron said a seven-figure sum for Mr Hester would be unacceptable.

The Prime Minister said rewards for failure made ‘people’s blood boil’ when – in the words of Mervyn King – hard-up Britons were suffering 'a ferocious squeeze'.

But Cameron has been placed in a very difficult position, not just by Osborne's inflammatory comments, but also by criticism today which has come from within the coalition government.

Speaking on BBC1's Question Time, Lib Dem Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne said Hester had earned more in three days than a soldier serving on the frontline in Afghanistan would earn in a year.

Angry: David Cameron said that the rewards for failure make people's 'blood boil' while Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne, right said Hester had a duty to refuse the bonus, which is more than a soldier earns a year

''I think he should reflect on that,' said Mr Browne.

'He
 is working for a company which is five sixths owned by us, the 
taxpayer, and I think he has to think like a public servant, not like 
someone who's there to line their own pocket.

'He needs to think like a public servant who has a duty to his country, not just his own wealth.'

'No-one's forcing him to take this money. He could struggle on with £1.2m.'

David Cameron is now facing pressure from within the coalition to back up his rhetoric with action.

Labour leader Ed Miliband seized the opportunity today to pressure Cameron, saying that the pay award showed the Prime Minister had failed to live up to his rhetoric on executive pay and shareholder activism.

'It's a disgraceful failure of leadership by the Prime Minister,' he said.

'He’s been promising for months action against excessive bonuses, executive pay, and now he’s nodded through a million-pound bonus.

Pressuring the PM: Ed Miliband, left, said the pay award was a clear failure of leadership from David Cameron while Boris Johnson said he was 'at a loss' to explain the size of the bonus

'He’s also been lecturing shareholders about how they need to be more active in holding executives to account.

'He owns, through the British Government, 83% of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

'He must now explain, not least to the British people, why he has allowed this to happen.'

London mayor Boris Johnson joined the condemnation, saying he was 'at a loss to justify' the scale of the payment.

He said he had sympathy for Mr Hester and wanted an end to 'incessant banker-bashing'.

But
 he went on: 'I find it absolutely bewildering because RBS occupies the 
same status in the economy as Gosbank did in the Soviet Union: it’s a 
state-owned bank.

'The idea that this is not in the control of the Government seems to me to be far-fetched.'

Protesters from civic campaign group 
Avaaz are due to gather at the RBS headquarters in London later to call 
for bonuses to be dropped.

Trade union leaders have also vented 
their anger at the size of the bonus, pointing out that millions of 
public sector workers were facing a pay freeze and lower pensions as 
well as job losses.

David Fleming, Unite national officer, said: 'What planet does Stephen Hester and his banking chums live on?

'Taking almost £1 million from 
taxpayers' pockets as a bonus is utterly disgusting and offensive to 
every working person across the country. How can a Royal Bank of 
Scotland senior banker who is responsible for sacking over 21,000 
workers be rewarded in this way?'

TUC general secretary Brendan Barber 
said: 'Ordinary people facing the biggest squeeze in their living 
standards for decades and businesses desperate for credit will not 
understand why Mr Hester should get such a huge bonus.

'The Government has been lecturing 
public servants about how they must accept a pay freeze and a big 
increase in pension contributions. They seem to have made an exception 
for Britain's best paid civil servant.'

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the 
GMB union, said: 'A bonus of nearly a million pounds looks to ordinary 
people like he has won the lottery - with a ticket they paid for.'

David Hillman, spokesman for the 
Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: 'Curbing Hester's bonus at state-owned 
RBS is a small step in the right direction but nowhere near enough.

Criticism: Sir Mervyn King said it would be wrong if rewards go to a small elite earlier this week, while TUC leader Brendan Barber said the Government's lectures on pay freezes clearly don't apply to Hester

It is believed any payout to Hester would be in shares rather than cash, and deferred for three years.

Senior Government sources said they 
were satisfied Mr Hester’s bonus, which was £2m last year, had been cut and insisted he had to be 
paid well or be lost to a better-paid job in the private sector.

Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore 
Capital, agreed and argued that the real test of Hester's pay is how 
much he could earn somewhere else.

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, 
said the bonus was fair, adding: ‘A safer and more valuable RBS is in 
the interests of our customers, shareholders and the UK economy.

‘We are progressing well toward this goal under the leadership of Stephen Hester.’

But Hester’s bonus is just the first of many for staff at a bank in the process of laying off 3,500 employees. 

The bank fell slightly short of its 
target for lending to small firms under the government’s Project Merlin 
initiative to get credit flowing through the economy,

Critics argue the Merlin goals are faulty as they measure banks’ ‘capacity’ to lend – the money they make available in theory.

Small firms claim the banks have hiked up loan charges and fees, deterring businesses from taking up the funds.

Under the terms of Merlin, RBS and 
the country’s other four biggest banks pledged to lend small and 
medium-sized firms £76billion in 2011.

Between January and September, 
this should have seen them hand out £57billion – and they fell £1billion
 short.

Lord Oakeshott said RBS, which is 83 
per cent state owned following its bail-out in 2008, was ‘the worst 
culprit by far’ among the banks.

RBS earlier this month announced a 
further 3,500 job losses in its investment banking operation, on top of 
2,000 announced previously. The bank has shed around 30,000 staff in the
 past two years, 22,000 of them in the UK.
