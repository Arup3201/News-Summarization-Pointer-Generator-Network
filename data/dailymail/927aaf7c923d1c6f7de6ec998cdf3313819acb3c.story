No details: Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre gave no details about the DNA of the 28 bodies that were uncovered in clandestine graves last week

The governor of the southern Mexico state where 43 college students disappeared said Saturday that some of the bodies recovered from clandestine graves last weekend did not match the missing students.

Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre gave no details about the DNA of the 28 bodies that were uncovered in clandestine graves last week. CBS News reports that the remains were severely burned and DNA tests are being conducted to identify the dead. 

On Sept. 26, 43 local students were taken, but not as a result of organized crime -- they were taken by local police officers.

Authorities say that officers rounded up the students who had visited the city from their rural college in Ayotzinapa to solicit donations and drove off with them after two shooting incidents in Iguala in which police gunfire killed six people and left 25 wounded.

Investigators say that a video showed police taking an undetermined number of students from the city after the violence, according to ABC 7.  

Yahoo News reports that the officers are believed to have turned the students over to a local drug gang that had ties to Iguala's fugitive mayor, Jose Luis Abarca. Few students escaped.

ABC 7 reports that a person taken into custody told authorities that 17 students were taken to a mass grave site outside of Iguala and killed.

At a news conference in Iguala, the governor spoke but made no comment regarding what authorities found at nearby mass graves discovered near the site as announced Thursday by Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam.

More than two weeks after the students' disappearance, 34 arrests have been made in the case including 26 Iguala police officers. Four of the suspects led investigators to four mass graves near the site where the 28 bodies were found. 

Karam declined to confirm or dispute the governor's claim that the uncovered bodies did not match those of the students. He stated that experts 'have not finished testing.' 

Protesters: Thousand of people have turned out to protest  since the students' disappearance

Throw him out: Protesters are pleading with the Mexican federal government to throw out Aguirre for failing to keep citizens safe

Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer representing families of the missing students, told the Associated Press that it was unfortunate that information was released to the public before being released to the students' families.   

Many have turned out to protest since the students' disappearance, according to ABC 7. Protesters are pleading with the Mexican federal government to throw out Aguirre for failing to keep citizens safe.

A Mexican Consul General in Los Angeles said that Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking action by replacing the police department and seizing their weapons. 

"This tarnishes the collective national effort we have to truly turn Mexico into a country of greater progress and development," he told the AP, referring to the disappearance of the 43 students.
