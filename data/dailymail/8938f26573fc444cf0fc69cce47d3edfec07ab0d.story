Cesc Fabregas believes it was easier to win the Premier League title during his days as an Arsenal player than it is now.

The 27-year-old has starred for Chelsea since his £30million summer move from Barcelona this summer.

The Spain midfielder has scored once and laid on 11 assists in the league as Jose Mourinho's side sit three points clear of champions Manchester City at the top of the table.

Chelsea have only tasted defeat once in the Premier League so far this campaign, but despite their impressive record Fabregas believes the standard of football in England is a lot more competitive than when he left Arsenal in 2011.

Fabregas, who did not make a single appearance when the Gunners last won the league in 2003-04, told Chelsea Magazine this month: 'The league has improved since I left in 2011, especially defensively and also in terms of the stability that teams try to have — the coaches and teams are more afraid to drop points now.

'I feel that for the top teams it is a bit more difficult to attack than it was before. Spain technically is a great league and maybe it's still a little more tactical than England but that has improved a lot here.

'That doesn't mean in Spain it is more difficult to beat the opponent because in England — especially with the fans, passion and commitment — when we play away it is always difficult; all the teams want to attack.'

Fabregas left Arsenal to rejoin Spanish giants Barcelona in the summer of 2011
