Premier League newcomers Burnley are in talks with Chelsea over a loan move for their England under-21 midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah.

The 19-year-old has previously spent time on loan at Watford, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough but Jose Mourinho feels he is ready for a taste of the Premier League.

Chelsea already have 15 players on loan around England and Europe but Burnley will ask to see if they can continue to pay part of Chalobah’s reported £35,000-a-week wages.

First team action: The 19-year-old is poised with a move to Burnley to gain Premiership experience

Burnley manager Sean Dyche has already signed seven players this summer including £2.5m striker Lukas Jutkiewicz and Michael Kightly from Stoke, as the club adapt to life back in the top flight

Dyche is also poised with a £3million bid for Bolton midfielder Mark Davies and hopes to wrap up the signing of Hull midfielder George Boyd on transfer deadline day.

The Scot wasn't in Hull's matchday squad for Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa having fallen out of favour at Steve Bruce’s side.

Potential: Chalobah hasn't featured in the Chelsea first team yet but is an England Under-21 international

On the move: Scotland international George Boyd is expected to sign for Burnley from Hull on Monday
