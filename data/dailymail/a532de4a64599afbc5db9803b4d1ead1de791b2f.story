Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told attendees of a New Hampshire meet and greet this morning that 'over half the people on disability' are undeserving and are 'gaming the system.'

The 2016 presidential hopeful made the remarks while speaking at a breakfast for legislative leaders at Murphy's Diner in Manchester that was open to the press.

His speech was videotaped by a Democratic tracker, and an excerpt containing the remarks on persons claiming to be disabled was posted to YouTube.

'Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts,' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a 2016 presidential hopeful, told a group of state legislators at Murphy's Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire this morning after inferring that those sort of people are 'gaming the system'

In the short clip, circulated by the Democratic National Committee, Paul can be seen saying, 'You know the thing is is that all of these programs, there's always somebody who's deserving, and everybody in this room knows somebody who's gaming the system.

'And what I tell people is, if you look like me, and you hop out of your truck, you shouldn't be getting a disability check,' he said.

Continuing, Paul told the small group that had gathered to hear him speak, 'Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts.

'Join the club,' he added, eliciting laughter from his audience. 'You know, who doesn't get up a little anxious for work and their back hurts. Everybody over 40 has a back pain.'

In an email sent to reporters the DNC said Paul's comments were 'eerily reminiscent of Mitt Romney’s infamous 2012 “47 percent” remarks.'

The incident is widely credited with tanking the Republican presidential nominee's odds of beating President Barack Obama in the general election.

While speaking at a private fundraiser, Romney claimed that 'there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what...who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.' 

Romney did not know he was being videotaped. Members of the media were invited to attend Paul's event in New Hampshire today.

DNC spokesman Mo Elleithee told The Courier-Journal that Paul's comments are 'insulting to millions of Americans with disabilities.'

'They want leaders who will help them get a fair shot, not condescend to them or accuse them of gaming the system,' Elleithee said. 'Rand Paul has again proven he's not a new type of Republican - when it comes to helping expand opportunity, he's no better than Mitt Romney.'

Paul did not back away from his earlier remarks in a statement provided to DailyMail.com on Wednesday afternoon.

'We absolutely should take care of those truly in need of help,' Paul said. 'But the system is broken, and when people can game the system, they are stealing from those who are truly disabled and won't receive the care and aid they need.

'We must reform the system to ensure that those who really need help receive it.'

The Kentucky senator is in New Hampshire today meeting with various local activists, business owners and politicians while his colleagues in the Senate travel to to Hershey, Pennsylvania, for a party pow wow. They'll be joined at the retreat by House Republicans later this afternoon. 

Throughout the past several months Paul has added seasoned operatives to his political action committee all while playing coy about his 2016 plans.

Paul has not formally announced a presidential campaign but his hiring of a campaign manager on Tuesday signaled his intentions, and an official campaign launch is expected to come in the spring.
