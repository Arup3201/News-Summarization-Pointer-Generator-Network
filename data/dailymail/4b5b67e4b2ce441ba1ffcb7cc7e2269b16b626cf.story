A Birmingham family claims they were banned from boarding a plane and left stranded in Turkey for two days after their autistic 11-year-old son was deemed 'unfit to fly' by tour operator Thomas Cook.

Arshad Sherbaz and Selina Begun said they were told that their son, Mustafah, was not allowed to board the plane at Dalaman Airport, even though they had already checked in, because he was a 'safety risk' and they did not have a 'fit to fly' certificate from a doctor.

They were forced to remain in the country, along with their 19-year-old daughter, Meelam, until they obtained the document and a doctor prescribed anti-anxiety drugs for Mustafah's journey home to Ward End.

The family spent £2,300 on the Thomas Cook package holiday to the Mediterranean and has been offered an apology and £750 in compensation from the London-based tour operator.

They were left feeling angry and embarrassed after they were turned away at the gate and forced to spend an additional £300 on a hotel, food and taxis while they obtained the certificate during their getaway last July.

Mustafah's 41-year-old father and full-time caregiver, Arshad, said: 'They told us we needed a doctor's note to allow him to fly from the airport and were asked to sit in another area while we watched all the other passengers board the plane. We were gobsmacked.

'Someone from Thomas Cook told us that they had spoken to the pilot who had refused to let my son on the plane to fly home. They said Mustafah was a safety risk and was not fit to fly.

'We couldn't understand. I had notified Thomas Cook before the holiday about my son's disability. The only thing I could think of was that he had a small tantrum on the flight on the way out.'

Mustafah, who communicates through sign language, became stressed during the flight to Turkey and banged on a toilet door, but was calmed down by his father.

Arshad described it as 'a long day' as the family had missed its flight from London Gatwick Airport and had to return to Birmingham for another flight.

He said: 'My son had been awake a long time and was tired. It was the only reason I could think of why they weren't letting him fly.'

The family were left feeling angry after they were turned away at the gate at Turkey's Dalaman Airport

After they were turned away in Dalaman they tried to see the airport doctor but were referred to a local hospital.

They were offered an ambulance but were told that they would be billed for the ride.

Arshad said: 'They strapped my son to a stretcher and we were all sitting in the back of the ambulance. It just didn't feel right. I didn't have any faith in what was going on. I saw a taxi pull up and put my family in the taxi instead.'

After obtaining the certificate and anti-anxiety medication the family had to wait 40 hours for the next flight back to the UK.

When they returned to Dalaman Airport, however, neither the airport nor Thomas Cook asked to see the document, said Arshad.

'After all of that they never asked to see the letter. Our week-long holiday, which had been so lovely, ended in a nightmare.

'Mustafah had never taken any medication like that before. We had to trust what they had given him.

'We have always tried to make his life as enjoyable and normal as possible. We have travelled to Morocco, Spain, Italy and the USA, but have never been treated like this.'

A Thomas Cook spokesman said the company takes the welfare and safety of its customers 'very seriously', and that the decision to seek a certificate from a medical professional rested with Medlink, a company it contracts.

The tour operator told MailOnline Travel: 'Prior to their return flight, the company we use for medical assistance advised that Mr and Mrs Sherbaz's son would need to be seen by a doctor before flying home to ensure he was well enough for the flight.

'Our crew explained this to the family and we ensured they were able to travel to the hospital. They returned to the UK on our flight the next day at no cost and we also ensured they had support and welfare at the airport.

'Our customer services team are now liaising directly with the family to ensure they are compensated for the additional expenses they incurred and we'd like to apologise for any confusion caused during their holiday.

'At all times, our concern was for the health of Master Sherbaz.'

Carol Povey, Director of the National Autistic Society’s Centre for Autism, said a ‘fit to fly’ certificate is nothing but an inconvenience for families and could put more stress on the child.

She told MailOnline Travel: ‘People with autism and their families want to access the same opportunities most of us take for granted, and this includes holidays and travel.

‘But many rely on routines to make sense of an often confusing world and can find the busy and unpredictable airport and plane environment distressing and disorientating.

‘We struggle to see what difference a 'fit-to-fly' certificate could make to these issues, apart from create an inconvenience which could in itself create more stress for the individual and their family.’

She said airports and airlines can make a difference by helping to prepare a child or adult with autism for their journey so they know what to expect and understand that there could be delays or cancellations.

‘By making small adjustments, they can help build familiarity with the airport process and environment, for instance by having easily accessible information on their websites.

‘Staff at every stage of the flight process, from check-in to arrival at their destination, should be aware of autism so they can notice if a passenger is feeling distressed and offer appropriate support and advice.

‘This type of preparation and support from airports and airlines can prevent other families from having to go through the type of stress and inconvenience experienced by Mustafah and his family.’
