Found: An autopsy showed preliminary results that Katelyn Wolfe, who disappeared from her home on June 6, died from asphyxia

Two men have been arrested after the body of a missing 19-year-old girl was found in a pool of water.

Preliminary autopsy results indicated that Katelyn Wolfe, who disappeared from her Linton, Indiana, home on June 6, died from asphyxia.

Police arrested Jordan Buskirk, 26, and Randall Crosley, 25, from nearby Jasonville in connection with Wolfe’s death.

The teen went missing from her 
Sullivan County area home two months ago in the middle of the night.

A search began for Wolfe just hours after she posted a cryptic 
Facebook message.

'Her last facebook post said that she 
was looking to have some fun, she was out walking, and it said that she 
was going to go with these creeps that kept driving by,' said stepmother
Laura Wolfe reported RTV6.

Linton, Ind., Police Chief Troy Jerrell said the family was able to confirm that the body is Katelyn from a photograph provided by investigators.

He also said the two men are believed to have intentionally killed Wolfe: 'They knew what they were doing all along,' Jerrell told ABC News 
affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis. '

'We don't believe it was an accidental 
type thing.'

He declined to elaborate on what led police to the suspects, who were both being held at the Greene County Jail in Bloomfield.

Katelyn was Facebook friends with one of the suspects - Buskirk, reported WHTR.

His page shows him 
holding a toddler and his last status updates reads 'Watching a true 
original classic... Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'

Crosley's page shows a baby and he posted, 'I am now officially a happily-married man,' in March.
