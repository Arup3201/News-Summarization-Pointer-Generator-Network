Steven Gerrard was sensationally sent off within 38 seconds of coming on the pitch at Anfield, after stamping on Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera.

The Liverpool legend was left out of the starting line-up by Brendan Rodgers but came on at the start of the second half to rally the troops.

However Gerrard found himself in deep trouble after clattering through Juan Mata before stamping on Herrera following a heavy challenge. Referee Martin Atkinson had no choice but to send off the perplexed Liverpool skipper after just 38 seconds of entering the fray.

As Gerrard emerged from the tunnel, former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher told Sky Sports: ‘He had to go on. Some of the Liverpool players froze out there in the first-half. Liverpool need some football arrogance on the pitch today.’ 

Ahead of kick-off Carragher admitted he was not surprised by Brendan Rodgers' decision to name Steven Gerrard on the bench for Liverpool's crunch clash against Manchester United. 

Gerrard, who faced rivals United for the last time in a Liverpool shirt, had to make do with a place on the bench as Rodgers decided to go for a central midfield duo of Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen.

And Carragher felt it was the right decision. Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of the Anfield battle, the former Liverpool defender said: 'No I'm not surprised. 

'He’s only played 20 minutes against Swansea recently because he’s been injured.

'Is Steven Gerrard a better player than Joe Allen? Yes. But for Brendan Rodgers we’ve got to remember than Gerrard is leaving in the summer and Allen will be here next season. So although Rodgers is aiming for the top four that certainly comes into it.

Brendan Rodgers made the right call in naming Gerrard on bench before kick-off, according to Carragher  

'Steven Gerrard can come on after an hour and really lift the crowd when the legs are tired and use any extra space.'

Carragher's fellow pundits Thierry Henry and Gary Neville also agreed with Rodgers' decision.

Neville said: 'It’s probably the starting line-up Manchester United expected. 

'The question was more about whether Rodgers would return with the Manchester City formation with [Raheem] Sterling at the top but that would sacrifice Daniel Sturridge who brings them goals and is their best finisher, so he’s stuck.'

While Henry added: 'Gerrard would tell you if he’s not fit and the team is playing very well.

'Look he has the quality to come on and change the game. I wouldn’t say he should start but it would be an amazing story if he got the winner.'

Rodgers insisted before the match that Gerrard understood the decision regarding his omission. ‘Steven’s got a great history in this fixture but also across his career,' explained the Liverpool boss.

'He’s still a top class player but he understands the team is playing well. I had a word with him earlier in the week and told him my plan to stick with the team and he’s been brilliant working with the players. He’s definitely ready if he’s called upon.' 

The 34-year-old has played 34 times against Manchester United during his prestigious career at Anfield
