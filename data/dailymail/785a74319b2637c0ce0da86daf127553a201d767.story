The full lips and unruly brown hair once helped his famous father turn heads wherever he went.

And it seems Sir Mick Jagger’s son Lucas has been blessed with exactly the same rock star looks.

The 14-year-old could almost have been mistaken for the Rolling Stone as a teenager in the Sixties on a recent trip to the theatre in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Sir Mick’s seventh child, Lucas was 
the product of an extra-marital affair between his father and Brazilian 
model Luciana Gimenez.

The singer, now 70, met her backstage at a Stones gig in Rio de Janiero in 1998 while he was married to Jerry Hall.

Miss Gimenez, 43, was described as ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’ by Miss Hall during her divorce the following year.

She discovered Lucas’ existence while hosting a dinner party with her husband at their home in Richmond, west London.

The Texan model was handed a copy of a
 newspaper at their front door which revealed details of the child’s 
birth and immediately told him their 22-year relationship was over.

Sir
 Mick has six other children, from three relationships: daughter Karis, 
43, with Marsha Hunt, Jade with former model Bianca Jagger and 
Elizabeth, 29, James, 28, Georgia, 21, and Gabriel, 16 with Miss Hall.

He
 had a string of affairs, including high-profile flings with Janice 
Dickinson and Carla Bruni, but has been dating fashion designer L’Wren 
Scott since 2001.
