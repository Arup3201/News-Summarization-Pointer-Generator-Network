A Sikh man has been jailed for ten years after being convicted of attempting to assassinate a former Indian military lieutenant general in 2012.

Lakhbir Singh, 26, is the latest, and final, person to be imprisoned over the attack, with three men and one woman already serving time.

Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, 78, and his wife Meena were holidaying in London when they were ambushed in ‘revenge’ over a military operation that took place in Punjab more than 30 years ago.

Retired Indian soldier Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar survived a terrorist attack in London last September. Four men ambushed him and his wife Meena, slicing his throat before stabbing him in the jaw

Last year, Harjit Kaur, 39, Dilbag 
Singh, 37, Mandeep Singh Sandu, 34, and 33-year-old Barjinder Sangha 
were all jailed between 10.5 and 14 years for their part in the attack 
while Lakhbir Singh remained at large.

He
 was arrested last month after handing himself into a local police 
station in Ascoli, Italy and was taken in by Italian authorities in 
connection with the attack.

Sing was handed ten years in prison for grievous bodily harm with intent at Southwark Crown Court today.

The
 four men attacked Lt Gen Brar in London, in front of his wife, after 
Kaur, girlfriend of Dilbag Singhhad fed them information about his 
whereabouts.

It was planned
 in retaliation for a controversial military raid - Operation Blue Star -
 led by Lt. General Brar on the sacred Golden Temple of Amritsar in 
north west India in 1984.

Harjit Kaur (left), from London, was jailed for 11 years after a jury found her guilty of wounding with intent. Barjinder Singh Sangha, (right), from Wolverhampton, had already admitted the charge and was jailed to 10 years and six months for his part in the attack on Lt. General Brar

The men, tipped off by Kaur, followed Lt. General Brar and his wife as they returned to the Mostyn Hotel in Marble Arch.

Sangha grabbed Mrs Brar by the throat and hurled her against a wall in nearby Old Quebec Street.

When Lt. General Brar intervened, Sangha sliced his throat and stabbed him in the jaw, as the other men held him down.

The
 retired soldier, who served in the Indian army for 40 years, was taken 
to St Mary's Hospital on September 30, 2012 but survived the attack.

At the time fo the sentencing of the other four defendants,
 Judge Jeffrey Pegden said: ‘I
 am of the view that the attackers wanted to inflict more serious harm, 
but that Kuldip Brar fought back, preventing that happening’, the judge 
said.

General Brar was targeted almost three decades after he led the military operation to flush out Sikh separatists from the holy shrine in Punjab.

The raid, codenamed Operation Blue Star, resulted in the deaths of more than 500 civilians.

In
 the aftermath of the Temple raid, Lt Gen Brar told how he has been 
subjected to ‘unlimited threats’ and has been branded ‘the number one 
enemy of the Sikhs’, leaving him needing maximum security.

Commander
 Duncan Ball, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command said today: ‘The 
conviction of Lakhbir Singh now means that all those directly involved 
in the attempt to assassinate General Brar have been brought to justice.

‘We are pleased that today’s sentencing reflects the seriousness of this pre-planned and organised attack.’
