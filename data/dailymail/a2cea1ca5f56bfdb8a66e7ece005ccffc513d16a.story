David Cameron today urged European leaders to ‘be good to their word’ and stop funding ISIS fanatics by paying ransoms.

The Prime Minister said ‘tens of millions of dollars’ had been paid to extremists in Iraq and Syria. He said this was helping to promote terror against Britain.

Mr Cameron told MPs France, Germany and other countries in the G7 group of wealthy countries had pledged not to pay ransoms at a summit in Northern Ireland last year. But the PM indicated they were not sticking to this agreement.

The Prime Minister’s remarks, in the House of Commons this afternoon, come after ISIS extremists threatened to murder a British hostage after releasing a video of themselves beheading two American journalists.

The Briton’s capture emerged in a propaganda video titled 'A Second Message to America', in which US journalist Steven Sotloff is murdered by an ISIS executioner who speaks with a British accent. The murderer is believed to be the same man who beheaded James Foley two weeks ago.

Former Lib Dem leader Sir Ming Campbell asked the Prime Minister today whether those who were paying ransoms were aware that the cash was being used ‘to advance the malevolent objectives of terrorism’.

The Prime Minister said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that the many tens of millions of dollars that ISIL has raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism, including terrorism affecting our own country.

‘At the G8, I launched an initiative to try to get other countries to sign up to a very clear doctrine that in the case of terrorist kidnap, no ransom should be paid. Britain continues with this policy; America continues with this policy; but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure that other countries are good to their word.’

Mr Cameron’s remarks are a barely-veiled rebuke to France, Germany and Italy who are known to pay ransoms.

The Prime Minister last month faced calls to confront the French President Francois Hollande over claims the country is funding ISIS terrorists by paying ransoms to free hostages.

Britain and the United States refuse to negotiate with terrorists in an effort not to encourage further hostage taking. But this policy is being undermined by European countries negotiating secret deals to free their citizens.

Over the last five years ISIS is thought to have earned £75million ransoming more than 50 captives. Kidnapping Europeans has become the main source of revenue for Al Qaeda and its spin off.

Four French and three Spanish hostages have been released this year after money was delivered through an intermediary.

Fears have been raised that European countries’ policy of secretly negotiating with terrorists is undermining the West’s response to the growing threat from ISIS.

Tory MP Andrew Rosindall, who sits on the respected Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘If they are paying ransoms they are harming the interests of the free world and by playing the game of terrorism by paying ransom money they are funding and furthering the cause of ISIS and Al Qaeda.

‘The French and the Spanish should really look at themselves in the mirror and ask whether this is the right thing to do.’

‘The Prime Minister should be raising this with President Hollande. The French are undermining all of us by doing this.’

A Foreign Office source told MailOnline it was a concern for the Government. ‘It is definitely an issue,’ the source said.

‘All you can do is emphasise what we do and why we think it is right. A lot of countries won’t talk about it. Some countries will say one thing and another thing happens.’

But a former senior Cabinet minister told MailOnline that there was no point ‘tweaking the French tail’ because the UK would not get anywhere.

He added: ‘They don’t admit it. It comes out through what other people say. When you see a French President on the tarmac greeting a freed hostage you can be fairly sure they paid.’

Militants are now thought to hold more than 20 captives, mostly aid workers, journalists and photographers who they are ransoming in order to raise funds.
