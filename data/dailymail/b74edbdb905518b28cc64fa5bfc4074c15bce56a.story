A pregnant woman in Iowa had a particularly difficult labor this week when she was held at gunpoint on her way to the hospital.

Rachel Kohnen and her husband Ben were going 30 miles over the speed limit on Tuesday morning in Fort Dodge, Iowa, as Rachel was in labor and felt that if the two did not get to the hospital soon she was going to give birth in a car.

Around that time, a police officer turned on his sirens to pull the couple over, but they kept going.

Keep going: Even after a police officer turned on thir sirens to pull the copuple over, Rachel told her husband to keep going so she wouldn't give birth in the car

Baby girl: Rachel ultimately gave birth to her fourth child Hazel (above) who weight in a 10 pounds

'He starts following me and he turns on his lights an my wife says we can’t pull over. The baby is coming now,' Ben, who was driving, told NBC 13.

Said Rachel, 'I did tell him not to stop.'

She then added, 'I think I was screaming,  "Oh dear God, we can’t have the baby in the car.”'

The couple called 911 to notify them of the situation, but it was too late. 

Police had set up a stop and thrown down tire spikes, so the couple's tires were blown out, and that was when things got really rough on Rachel.

Police ordered her to the ground and even held her at gunpoint, before they finally realized she had a baby on the way.

Did their best: The couple claims to have called 911 to tell them about the situation, but it did not help

Damage: There is now still a chance the couple will be charged for speeding and not stopping, and they will definitely need new tires (above)

The scene: The two were going 85 mph in a 55mph zone, being stopped on Iowa Highway 7 (above)

And what a baby it was, as after the couple was driven to the hospital Rachel gave birth to her fourth child, Hazel, who weighed a whoping 10 pounds.

And while the Kohnens seem to be taking this terrifying incident in stride, and mom and baby are both doing well, charges may still be brought against the two.

Manson Police Chief Tom Ritts said that while no charges have been filed yet, it’s up to County Attorney to decide if that remains the case. 

Here's hoping these two get a break.
