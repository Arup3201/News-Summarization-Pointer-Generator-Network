Many cats are mesmerised by televisions and their moving pictures. Alphie the kitten was more fascinated by the six-inch aerial  on his owner’s TV – and ended up swallowing it.

The tabby needed emergency surgery when the metal antenna became lodged in his throat and stomach. Owner Vanessa Waite, 36, of Sheffield, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw the X-ray.

'The aerial looked huge in his tiny body. It’s amazing he’s gone on to make a full recovery. He’s still a real handful.

Lucky: Vets at PDSA's Sheffield PetAid hospital were stunned when x-rays revealed the six-inch antenna

'He’ll try to stick anything in his mouth. He still loves the TV too but I don’t leave him alone with it anymore.’

The spike became lodged in Alphie's oesophagus
 and stomach, forcing vets at animal charity The People's Dispensary for
 Sick Animals (PDSA) to perform emergency surgery to save the kitten's 
life.

Shortly after owner Vanessa Waite brought Alphie home she noticed that her new pet was something of a telly addict.

He
 would sit mesmerised by the moving pictures on the television screen, 
but Ms Waite said she had no idea that her kitten had also developed an 
unhealthy obsession with the aerial.

She said that she had taken Alphie to see the vets near her home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, after he had been sick, and noticed that her aerial was missing.

'One night I heard a loud bang and 
went upstairs to investigate but I assumed Alphie had fallen off the 
window sill,' said the 36-year-old.

'He seemed okay and was just hiding under the bed.

'However,
 during the night he was being sick so the next morning I took him to 
the PDSA.

'It wasn't until later that I realised that one of the aerial 
antennas was missing from my TV.'

Ms Waite rushed her pet to the nearby PDSA Sheffield PetAid hospital where she was told that the aerial would prove to be fatal if left inside Alphie for much longer.

Surgeons had to carefully remove the metal rod through Alphie's minute stomach.

Senior vetinary surgeon Liz Airey said that Alphie's case was one of the most unusual she had ever come across.

'It's very rare,' she said.

'We did have a case a few years ago when a dog ate a tent peg but it's very unusual for such a solid object to be swallowed in this way.

'It seems as though the kitten had been playing with the antenna and inadvertently swallowed it which is a very unusual accident.

'It's fortunate that he didn't swallow it the other way round as the sharp broken end could have punctured his stomach and caused damage to his intestines which could have been fatal.'

Fortunately Alphie has now a full 
recovery following his ordeal, however Ms Waite said that he had not 
learned from his near-death experience.

She said: 'I'm so grateful to PDSA for saving his life, and it's amazing that he's gone on to make a full recovery.

Ordeal: Alphie managed to swallow the metal aerial despite the fact it is nearly as long as him

'When he came home it was like nothing had happened - it definitely hasn't taught him any lessons.'

The PDSA said that vets have seen 
many cases of pets that have swallowed strange items, including rubber 
ducks, golf balls, socks and babies dummies

The charity advises all pet owners to consult their vet immediately if they suspect their animal has swallowed something unusual.

Recovery: Owner Vanessa Waite, right, said that Alphie had fully recovered from his ordeal and although he was still a fan of the television she no longer leaves him alone with it
