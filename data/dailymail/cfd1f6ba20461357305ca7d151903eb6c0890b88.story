With his penchant for 'hunny' and a philosophical outlook, Winnie-the-Pooh was the charming bear whose tales captivated children from the day they were first published nearly 90 years ago.

But while the the bear of little brain is still popular with his young audience, a publisher has decided that perhaps his gentle stories are not fast-moving enough for today's youngsters.

Today, Egmont Press releases a new app for iPad and iPhone - featuring a shorter, and speeded-up version of Pooh's adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood.

The story of Winnie-the-Pooh has been abridged for a new app because today's children have shorter attention spans

The Classic Pooh app, which is read by actor Rufus Jones and is free to download, abridges AA Milne's story because the publisher says children will lose interest if the story does not zip along.

Kristian Knak, who developed the story for Egmont, said today's young readers would move on if they were not grabbed in the first 60 seconds.

'Today's children's attention spans are slightly different to how they were in 1926,' he said.

‘We have a minute to get them on board.  If not, they will move on to the next app,' he told The Times.

Egmont's Tim Jones said the stories had to be made more appealing to a modern audience to keep them relevant to today's children.

‘As a children’s publisher, we want to be where children are experiencing entertainment and that is in the digital format,’ he Metro.

The Classic Pooh app will feature animated versions of the original drawings by the late Ernest Shepard

‘We’ve been working with illustrations that are 85 years old which have a place in British culture, illustrations that are greatly loved. We had to look at it very sensitively and that’s what we’ve tried to do.’

A second story app is available to buy for £1.99, and further stories will be available later this year.

This morning, popular children's author Giles Paley-Phillips, 35, said it was 'tragic' that such a gentle story had to be speeded up for modern children.

The award-winning author of The Fearsome Beastie said: 'I've got two boys of my own, aged six and four, and we enjoy the bedtime ritual where we sit down and have time to read picture books and look at the illustrations.

'It is especially sad given that the Pooh stories are so soft and gentle, and have such lovely pictures.

'I am very against e-books, because I think everything in the modern world moves at such a frantic pace.  Reading a book at their own pace offers children a chance to slow down and use their imagination, and really enjoy the story.'

The new Classic Pooh app, available from today, features animations of the original Winnie-the-Pooh drawings

The Pooh stories for the app are not new, but the publisher has released publicity images drawn by Mark Burgess in the style of original illustrator E. H. Shepard of Pooh bear and his friend Piglet in modern settings.

There is one of Pooh taking a photograph of London skyscraper The Shard with his mobile phone, another showing the pair on the Millennium 'wobbly' Bridge, and another showing them getting off a Tube train.

Winnie-the-Pooh, who was named after Milne's son Christopher Robin's stuffed teddy bear, lost his hyphens when Disney adapted his stories for the screen in the 1960s.

The anthropomorphic bear and his friends have enchanted youngsters for decades, generating millions in the process.

In 1930, American Stephen Slesinger bought the US and Canadian rights for Pooh from Milne for $1,000 and 66 per cent of Slesinger's income, and by the following year it was a $50m-a-year business.

The stories about Pooh bear have been translated into many languages including Russian and even Latin, and have inspired films, television series, and a lucrative range of Pooh-related merchandise.
