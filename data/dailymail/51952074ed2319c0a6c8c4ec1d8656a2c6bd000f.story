A suspected criminal was arrested after a 90-minute 'Smokey and the Bandit' style pursuit when his truck careered off the road and jumped over an embankment. 

The driver, Stephen Richard Bartlett, 53, was wanted by police for a string of bank robberies across Santa Barbara and Orange County in California.

After he was spotted, Bartlett attempted to lose officers, who were supported by a helicopter by driving at speed across a series of southern California freeways.

Police arrested the suspected 'Hills Bandit' Stephen Richard Bartlett, pictured, following the chase 

The driver of the truck slewed wildly to the right, clipping the support of a small bridge, trying to hold his vehicle straight on the hard shoulder.

The white pick-up truck again pulled right violently, jumping over the edge of an embankment. The truck ploughs into the ground before rolling onto its side.

Luckily for the driver, the bottom of the embankment was quite sandy, reducing the severity of the impact, raising a large plume of dust.

The rear wheel of the truck spun for several seconds while the driver attempted to leave the cab.

Police soon arrive at the scene and the driver walks up the side of the embankment with his hands raised as nine armed police officers cover him.

Once back on tarmack, the driver is ordered to turn around back towards the truck with hands behind his head and to kneel down.

Bartlett struggled to walk  up the embankment while officers trained firearms at him to force his surrender

The suspected bank robber was arrested and then taken to hospital for treatment for minor injuries 

The dramatic footage is captured on a news helicopter that followed the high speed pursuit.

According to NBC Los Angeles, Bartlett is believed to be the 'Hills Bandit' who has raided a string of banks between Santa Barbara and Orange County. 

Police followed him after he allegedly took $12,000 worth of steel from a business in Santa Fe Springs. 

Police said he hit speeds of up to 85mph as he tried to escape justice - sometimes crossing the central reservation and heading the wrong way along the carriageway.

Police believe Bartlett is the so-called 'Hills Bandit' who was arrested following a 90-minute car chase 

After leaving Santa Fe Springs, Bartlett sped through Whittier, Le Habra and Brea, heading west, away from Los Angeles. 

He then turned north towards Rialto and San Bernardino where he was rammed by a California Highway Patrol officer. 

 A spokesman for the CHP told Los Angeles CBS local : 'At least on one occasion, we discontinued the pursuit for the safety of the public and decided it would be better for us to back out. We did have an airship, a unit up above following and was monitoring him.'

Police initially arrested Bartlett in connection with the suspected metal theft but soon he was linked to a string of robberies across California.
