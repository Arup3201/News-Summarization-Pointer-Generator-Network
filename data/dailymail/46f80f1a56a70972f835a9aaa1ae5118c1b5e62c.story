A fan of the popular Twilight books has taken her love of the vampire series to a more permanent level by having the characters etched across her back.

Cathy Ward, from Reading, Berkshire, showed off her £4,000 body art masterpiece at the opening of Breaking Dawn: Part One, at London's Westfield Stratford City last night.

And the supermarket worker had her dreams come true when she managed to get heartthrob Robert Pattinson to sign her arm.

Fan: Catherine Ward has had her back tattooed with the characters from 'Twilight'. The tattoo is based on the New Moon edition and has Edward, Jacob and Bella from left to right

The 50-year-old, who spent a painful 46 hours in the tattooist's chair getting her back and arms inked, said: 'I can't believe I made it to the premiere, it is a dream come true for me.

'Robert signed my arm and I am going to get my tattooist to trace its outline so I have it on me permanently.

'I already have five tattoos of Robert and this will be the icing on the cake.'

She wore a halterneck jumpsuit for last night's screening, leaving her main tattoo on show.

Her entire back is covered with scenes from the books and films, and includes the faces of Pattinson's co-stars Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart.

Ms Ward will now spend another £2,000 pounds getting her arms finished and another tribute tattoo across her chest.

She first decided to vamp-up her image after claiming the blood-sucking stars helped her lose five stone.

Pattinson's co-stars Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart are also featured on her back. The masterpiece cost £4,000

She said she dropped 14 dress sizes in just six months, ditching pasties and pizza in favour of getting stuck into the popular books and films.

And, she managed not to eat fatty foods despite working in the cake department of her local supermarket.

She said: 'A friend of mine got me the first film on DVD because I was feeling low.

'Once I started I just couldn't stop myself. I had to go out and buy all the books and films. I got hooked. It became my way of rewarding myself.

'I wanted a permanent reminder of the amazing series so I got a small tattoo and that turned into what I have got now.'

Catherine Ward said watching the films and reading the books helped her lose five stone and now she regularly exercises

Ms Ward, who has shrunk from size 24 to 10, added: 'The way I look at it I could be spending the money on going out drinking and eating but instead I'm spending it on something I am really passionate about.

'I have got a cross trainer, rowing machine and hand weights and I work out in my spare room which has got Twilight pictures all over the walls.

'I watch the films or listen to the soundtracks as I exercise. It has worked miracles.'

Ms Ward was able to attend last night's premiere after appealing to German TV company RTL, who covered the event, to put her on the guest list.

The four Twilight books, which have been translated into 38 different languages, have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide while the films have smashed box office records.
