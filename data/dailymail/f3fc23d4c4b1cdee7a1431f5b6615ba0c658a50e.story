Family feuds can drive people to take drastic action â€“ however most don't go to the extreme lengths of building a house just to spite a sibling.

This is Boston's skinniest house that was built by an enraged brother after he returned from war to find the land he'd inherited had been mostly taken by his brother.

The slender house measures just 10.4ft at its widest point and tapers to a mere 9.25ft at its narrowest. Inside the home the narrowest interior point is just 6ft 2 inches and the ceilings are just 6 ft, 4 inches high.

It has the uncontested distinction of being the narrowest house in Boston, Massachusetts, sitting at 44 Hull St in the North End area of the city.

However whilst it now may attract tourists and can even be rented out, the story behind the house has a tumultuous beginning.

As the story goes, two brothers who each inherited land from their deceased father got into a dispute shortly after the American Civil War.

Whilst the second brother was away serving in the military, the first brother built a large home on the land, leaving the soldier a shred of the property.

The first brother thought there was no room for his serving brother to build land on. But when he returned, he wanted to spite his brother for what he'd done.

So the wooden house was erected with the main purpose of blocking out sunlight and spoiling his brother's view of the nearby river.

The current owners once described to the Boston Globe newspaper what it's like to hold a party there.

Legend has it that in 1874, two brothers got into a dispute after each had previously inherited land from their deceased father

Jennifer Simonic said: 'We had a party of 10 one New Year's Eve, and when one person has to go to the bathroom, everyone has to move.'

Ms Simonic, 44, also explained how there are only five doors in the house and the bathroom and the living room are one of the few rooms actually separated by a door.

Each floor is a different room. The young daughter's bedroom shares the third floor with a closet. The second floor is the living room and bathroom. The top floor is the couple's master bedroom and home office.

'Instead of doors we have floors between each space and for guests we have to put a mattress down on the closet floor if they want to sleep.'

With only 964 square feet to work with, any person staying the skinny house has to be creative with their space.

The family is also used to being a tourist attraction, and has found people sitting in their backyard taking photos before.

At its 6'2" narrowest, a tall person can touch the opposing walls with outstretched arms.

Marblehead, Massachusetts, is the home to potentially the first example of a spite house in the U.S. - appropriately enough now known as The Old Spite House.

Like the above example in Boston, it was again a case of two brothers feuding over land. After one steamed ahead and built his wooden house, with views over the nearby Salem Sound, in 1716 his brother Thomas Wood constructed a home just 10ft wide as revenge.

An even smaller house was constructed in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1830. The bright blue building measures just 7ft wide, and is inhabited to this day.

Before it came into being, the narrow space it now occupies was an alleyway, which would often be crammed with horse-and-cart traffic and unwanted loiterers. So owner John Hollensbury built the home, which extends 25ft back, to win himself some peace and quiet.

Meanwhile in Freeport, New York, a Victorian landowner managed to change the whole shape of his town with an inconsiderately-placed home.

Despite the city's intention to lay out its streets in a perfect grid, the property developer insisted on setting out his home on a triangular piece of land, which planners had to build around.

Bone of contention: The roads are arranged into neat right angles until it hits the offending triangular point - forcing the road around

One spite house in England came into being because of a land war with a church. In Gainford, England, when reverend Jospeh Edleston died, his family were keen to memorialise him with a monument in the churchyard.

But Church of England authorities refused permission and instead suggesting the family donate their own land to the church and build the tower. Incensed, the family instead built a house of their own on the land with a 40ft column sticking out of it, which was completed in 1904.
