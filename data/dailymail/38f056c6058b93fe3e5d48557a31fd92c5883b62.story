Manchester United players brought some festive cheer to several brave fans suffering from serious and life-limiting illnesses.

Captain Wayne Rooney, Angel Di Maria, Darren Fletcher and Robin Van Persie welcomed the supporters to the club's Aon Training Complex as part of its 'Dream Days' initiative - where they signed autographs and posed for pictures.

One particular young fan, George Bould, who suffers from a rare form of kidney cancer was interviewed alongside Van Persie by BBC Sport for Football Focus and Match of the Day.

George told the Manchester Evening News: 'The day was absolutely brilliant. I was really excited and it's brilliant to see Robin van Persie.

'He signed all my stuff and was really nice.'

The eight-year-old presented the Dutchman with a homemade bracelet, which he proudly posed with on his Instagram page.  

Van Persie said: 'It's very important to give something back to all our fans, especially fans that have gone through a difficult time in their own way, so it gives me a great feeling to see all these smiles today.

'I hope it has a big impact on the kids and that we have given them a day they will never forget.'

The Manchester United Foundation has been running the Dream Days Scheme for 20 years and is hosted in partnership with charities including Starlight Children's Foundation, The Willow Foundation and Rays of Sunshine Children's Charity.

Another fan, James Barber, 29, was thrilled to fulfil a lifelong ambition of meeting United legend Ryan Giggs  

He said: 'It's been great to be honest.

Darren Fletcher was also involved to make the dreams of several youngsters come true

'To meet my favourite players, just to meet them in the flesh and get their autographs is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

'I was quite nervous this morning, but once I actually met them, they are just normal everyday people.'

Giggs, currently assistant manager to Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, said: 'It's important to do things like this, it gives the kids a lift and we as players love getting involved, especially around Christmas time.'
