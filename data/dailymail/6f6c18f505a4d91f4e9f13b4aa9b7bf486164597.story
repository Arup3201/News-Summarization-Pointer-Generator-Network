Brian Williams may be in hot water again over a story he shared years ago about his work as a volunteer firefighter.

Williams said in a 2011 interview that while he was a teenager, he ran into a burning home and while conducting a search, came across some thing 'warm and squishy.'

When he got outside he realized he had saved a puppy.

A few years earlier though, in an interview with Esquire, there were two puppies.

This comes as Williams (pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack) had to apologize over claims he was on a helicopter that took enemy fire in Iraq

'I remember one such house fire — the structure was fully involved with flames and smoke. I was wearing a breathing apparatus, conducting a search on my hands and knees, when I felt something warm, squishy and furry on the floor of a closet,' Williams told USA Today in 2011. 

'I instinctively tucked it in my coat. When I got outside, I saw two small eyes staring up at me, and I returned the 3-week-old (and very scared) puppy to its grateful owners.' 

In a July 2005 interview with Esquire however,  the embattled news anchor said; 'All I ever did as a volunteer fireman was once save two puppies.'

This as Williams recently confessed that he 'made a mistake recalling' a flight he took on a Chinook helicopter over Iraq in 2003. 

Williams had said in a new segment that the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade that miraculously didn't explode, and that he and those aboard managed to land with no loss of life.

That story too seemed to change too as it was being recounted by Williams though, as during an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman he said; 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.'

The whole thing went down in flames though when two men who were on the chopper called out Williams on his version of events, saying they never took any enemy fire.

Williams is now also being questioned over claims he made in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (above)

NBC has now launched a probe, and more of William's stories are now being questioned, including one in which he claimed to see a body floating down the street in the French Quarter of New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, right past the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he was staying.

The lack of flooding in that area makes this sighting seem unlikely to some.

He also claimed during the trip to be one of the few people to come down with dysentery, something that was not prevalent in the flood waters at that time, and that he witnessed a suicide. 

And NBC is not the only network looking into Williams, as reports have emerged that ABC is now doing the same in hopes of finding other possible false claims made by the newsman.

It is being reported that Tom Brokaw (left) thinks Williams (right) should be fired

'This has been a difficult few days for all of us at NBC News,' NBC News President Deborah Turness said in a staff memo circulated Friday. 

'Yesterday, Brian and I spoke to the Nightly News team. And this morning at the Editorial Exchange, we both addressed the wider group. Brian apologized once again, and specifically expressed how sorry he is for the impact this has had on all of you and on this proud organization.

'As you would expect, we have a team dedicated to gathering the facts to help us make sense of all that has transpired. We're working on what the best next steps are – and when we have something to communicate we will of course share it with you.'

Should Williams decide to step down, or be let go, there is one person who has already made it clear she would love to fill his role - Katie Couric. 

There have also been reports that former NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw believes Williams should be fire.
