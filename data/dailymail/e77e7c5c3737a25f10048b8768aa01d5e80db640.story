Callous: James Bray looked unrepentant at Southend Magistrates' Court today, where he was jailed for animal cruelty

A cannabis-smoking dog owner who killed his pet by throwing it out of a tenth floor window to 'teach it a lesson' has been jailed.

Sick James Bray, pictured, launched eight-year-old Deano out of his flat window in Southend, Essex, after the Staffordshire bull terrier relieved itself on his carpet.

The innocent dog suffered multiple injuries and died as a result of extensive internal bleeding following the tragic incident on January 18 this year.

Bray made a rude gesture at the cameras as he arrived at Southend Magistrates Court today, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and looked emotionless as lead magistrate Bill Thomas sentenced him to four months in prison.

The court heard how callous Bray tied up his dog in the bathroom of his flat for four hours after it had misbehaved.

When he returned to untie the dog at around 3am he found it had weed on the carpet.

He flew into a blind rage and attacked the dog before throwing it from the tenth-floor window.

Bray called the police after launching his dog from the window and stunned officers by confessing to the sickening assault.

In police interview he told shocked officers: 'It was a really good shot - I launched him by the scruff of his neck and he bounced off the window and went down.

'Maybe I was just out of my depth with this dog.

'Usually I’m really good with animals - I don’t drown kittens or salt slugs.

'I got carried away and angry at the time.

Long way to fall: Bray launched the dog out of his flat window at 3am, having left it tied up for four hours after smoking a cannabis joint

'I don’t know what came over me - it must be some kind of evil in this world.'

Bray admitted to police he had smoked a two-inch cannabis joint on the evening of the attack but said he still completely understood that what he was doing would kill his pet.

He told bemused officers: 'I was trying to teach it a lesson'.

The heartless thug even tried to escape charges by claiming he had attacked the dog in self-defence after it had bitten him on the foot.

Police could not find any evidence the dog had attacked Bray.

Bray - who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was sectioned following the sickening attack - pleaded guilty to three charges of animal cruelty when he appeared at the same court in May. 2012

Paul Markham, defending, described the situation as 'tragic' but called on magistrates to consider a suspended jail sentence due to his client’s early guilty plea.

He said: 'This is a matter which will undoubtedly provoke public outrage.

'My client has put forward no attempt to excuse his behaviour and accepts what he has done was an evil thing to do.'

Magistrates refused to accept Bray’s defence and handed him the maximum sentence available for an animal cruelty offence.

Lead magistrate Bill Thomas said: 'This is a horrendous incident which caused the death of a dog.

'There is no evidence this was caused by your mental illness and must be dealt with on the merits of the case.'

He sentenced Bray to the maximum six months' imprisonment - reduced by two months in recognition of his early guilty plea.

Bray was ordered to pay £500 costs to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and was disqualified from owning or keeping a pet for life.

Outside court, RSPCA Inspector Matthew Gough welcomed the prison sentence but called for tougher sentencing for animal cruelty offences.

He said: 'I hope this sentence acts as a strong deterrent to show that any cruelty to animals will not be tolerated.

'I think, given the mental health issues involved, the magistrates worked well within the guidelines.

'It would be appreciated if the sentences made available to magistrates for these offences were harsher.'
