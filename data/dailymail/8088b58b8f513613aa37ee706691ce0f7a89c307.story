Recycling targets blamed for the death of the weekly bin round are being routinely ignored across Europe, a major study shows.

While Britain is on course to meet the controversial goal of recycling half of all household waste by 2020, many other countries are barely out of the starting blocks.

Successive governments have placed restrictions on household waste in a bid to meet European Union targets originally imposed more than 20 years ago, which say countries should recycle half of their rubbish by 2020. These are widely blamed for the scrapping of weekly bin rounds for millions of families.

Yet other countries appear to have simply ignored the targets and are still dumping almost all of their waste in landfill sites.

Romania, for example, does so for 99 per cent of its rubbish compared to just over a third in the UK.

The new study by the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat shows that the UK’s efforts have been effective, raising recycling rates to 46 per cent.

'They're the same bunch he gave me last year'

This is above the European average and is a huge increase from the 10 per cent recorded at the turn of the century.

But the report also reveals that recycling remains a novelty in many parts of Europe. Romania is the worst offender, recycling just one per cent of its household waste.Croatia, the EU’s newest member, recycles just 16 per cent of its waste, sending the rest to landfill.

But slow progress is not confined to Eastern Europe. Malta recycles just 13 per cent, while Greece achieves only 18 per cent. Even France lags way behind the UK, recycling 39 per cent of its waste.

The figures will raise fresh concerns that the UK has been too quick to embrace inconvenient EU measures that other European nations appear to be able to ignore with impunity.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘We, as a self-governing country, should be free to decide how much we recycle and in what way. The figures from elsewhere in Europe are also instructive about how we deal with these things.

‘Every time we sign up to new regulations we create a rod for our own back because we have an army of officials to enforce them to the last comma.’

The European Commission defended the targets, saying increased recycling ‘protects the environment and human health and creates jobs and growth’.

Recycling policy is governed by a number of EU directives dating back more than 20 years. The most important is the Waste Framework Directive which states countries must recycle a minimum of 50 per cent of household waste by 2020.

A Commission spokesman said the UK’s record was ‘about average’ compared to other long-standing EU members.

He insisted that the worst offenders could even be fined if they did not up their game.

But Taxpayers’ Alliance director John O’Connell said: ‘Arbitrary targets become even more useless when no-one else holds up their end of the bargain.’
