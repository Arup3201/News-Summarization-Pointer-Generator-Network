A young girl suffering a rare condition, which causes her to vomit up to 30 times a day, has beaten the illness by taking up karate.  

Megan Stone, six, was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome which can cause her to throw up uncontrollably for up to 14 hours a day when an attack hits.

At her lowest ebb, she couldn't take part in any activities without being constantly sick.

She took days to recover after attacks and was so weak from vomiting she could barely stand and struggled to walk back from school. 

For years Megan Stone, 6, would have attacks causing her vomit for up to 14 hours due to rare condition Cyclical Vomitting Syndrome, until she found karate lessons helped ease the illness

After taking up martial arts Megan's attacks halved in frequency and severity. Her mother said this is due to Megan's body building up stamina

But after Megan, from Swansea in south Wales started taking karate lessons the number of attacks she suffers has almost halved.

Her mother Rachel Stone, 35 said she believes this is down to Megan's body building up stamina.

Megan's condition is so rare that three different doctors were unable to diagnose her illness, but offered theories ranging from viral infections, allergies and bulimia. 

But after almost two years of being almost constantly sick, Megan was referred to a specialist who diagnosed her with cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS) - a rare condition which causes suffers to vomit for long periods without interval.

She was suffering an attack every couple of weeks - but after starting martial arts classes, the frequency and length of the attacks has been dramatically cut.

Mrs Stone, a support worker for adults with learning disabilities said seeing her daughter so ill made her feel helpless as a mother.  

She said: 'It's horrendous seeing her when she's really ill, I feel useless as a mum you just want to take the pain away and make her feel better.

'She's so exhausted during and after the episodes that she can barely stand.

'We just carry her if she needs the toilet or to get to the doctors because her legs are like jelly and she's so dizzy. 

'I started taking my son Jack to karate in 2012 to try and build up his confidence, but Megan was too young then and too ill. 

Rachel Stone, 35, with husband Robert, 36, son Jack, 8 said that karate has not only helped daughter Megan's condition, but is an integral part of her family's life

'But she could see how much Jack was enjoying it and she was desperate to go, so at the end of last year, she started going and hasn't looked back.'

Learning that Megan could take karate lessons- and that they helped with her condition- was a massive help, Mrs Stone added.

She said: 'Meg had struggled to find any other activity she could keep up with, she even struggled to walk home from school without getting sick.

CVS symptoms are shared by many other conditions, and diagnosis is by ruling out every other cause. Because of this it can be years before reaching a diagnosis, and any effective treatment.

Many CVS sufferers with short and relatively infrequent attacks are often told it’s “a stomach bug” and receive little or no help for many years. 

In other sufferers psychological causes are often considered, when the cause is actually CVS this often delays treatment and adds stress to an already difficult situation.

Awareness of CVS in the medical profession has increased but CVS is still, all too often, overlooked as a potential diagnosis.

There have been no large, well-controlled studies, to show which drugs work best but a number of treatments are available to both stop, or reduce the severity of an attack, or to prevent the attack from starting.

Recent research suggests that mitochondrial DNA mutations may play a role in CVS and that it may be an inherited condition passed down the maternal line. 

'But it turned out karate was the perfect outlet, it was a massive turning point. Now her body is strong she can recover quickly, which is amazing.

'Before karate it used to take her days to get better, but it's really chopped the recovery period in half.

'Karate has not just helped my daughter, it's become an integral part of our family life.'

Megan first started showing symptoms of the rare condition - which typically develops during childhood - at the age of three when she would experience dizziness, stomach cramps, and excessive perspiration.

From that point, she would have attacks of severe vomiting every few weeks, causing her family to become increasingly concerned for her health.  

At a loss as to how to treat her condition, baffled doctors put her on anti-sickness medicine to prevent the nausea. Her body instantly rejected the tablets, regurgitating anything she attempted to swallow.

It wasn't until she was referred to a specialist at age four that Megan was diagnosed with the vomiting disorder.

The diagnosis had come after years of confusion and difficulty managing Megan's condition, said Mrs Stone.

She said: 'The doctors seemed clueless and so were we.

'The episodes were put down to viral infections, bugs, something she ate, but we knew deep down that it was something worse.

'No one else in the family was ill and after nearly a year she was finally sent to a specialist and was diagnosed with CVS, something I had never heard of before.

'We manage her episodes with paracetamol for the pain and try to keep her hydrated with ice lollies.' 

Megan wanted to try karate because her brother Jack, 8, enjoyed it so much

But the diagnosis brought no relief. Although doctors knew what was wrong with Megan they were unable to help her - and it was only when she joined her local karate club that her family noticed a difference in her symptoms.

Megan has now passed three belts with distinctions and will be grading for her next belt in the Lil Dragons programme in September.

Dr Robin Dover, Chair of the Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association UK, said: 'CVS affects approximately 2 per cent of the school age population but is probably as frequent in adults too - onset can be at any age.

'It is a poorly understood condition in which the sufferers are usually healthy and normal between episodes but have debilitating attacks of relentless nausea and vomiting.

'Attacks last between 1-4 days for most people but can last as long as two weeks in extreme cases, with vomiting up to six times an hour.

'Attacks in some sufferers happen in a regular pattern, i.e. every couple of weeks or months. In others there is no clear pattern.'
