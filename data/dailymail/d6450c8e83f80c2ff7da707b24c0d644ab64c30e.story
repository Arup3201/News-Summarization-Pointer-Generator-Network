The bodies of nearly 500 babies were handed over to Irish universities for research over a 25-year period, it emerged today.

New figures show the unclaimed remains of 474 infants who died in mother-and-baby homes and hospitals were used for anatomical study in medical departments.

They were given to four Irish universities between 1940 and 1965 apparently without consent.

The revelation comes amid controversy surrounding mother-and-baby homes in Ireland after the discovery that as many 800 infants may be buried in a mass grave outside a former home.

Trinity College Dublin (pictured in 1946) was among four universities which used the unclaimed remains of nearly 500 infants who died in mother-and-baby home and hospitals for research between 1940 and 1965

The colleges - the University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin and NUI Galway - were allowed to receive bodies donated by the individual or volunteered by a next-of-kin or loco parentis under the Anatomy Act of 1832.

However, the practice stopped in the mid-1960s after a public campaign by anatomy professors to encourage public donations.

All donations must now been made with informed consent.

In a statement to the Irish Independent, 
the anatomical committee of Irish medical schools said: 'Practices have 
long been in place to ensure absolute procedural sensitivity towards 
donors and families.'

The four universities have also now set 
up helplines for the first time for families who want details about the 
remains of relatives.

The University College Dublin used the unclaimed bodies of 249 babies for research before the practices was stopped in the mid-1960s following a public campaign to encourage public donation, new figures show

University College Dublin - 249

Trinity College Dublin - 103

Royal College of Surgeons - 87

NUI Galway - 35

Total - 474

The practice is expected to form part of the government's Commission of Investigation, of which an inital review report is due out early next week.

The Department of Health is also drawing up the Human Tissue Bill which set out new arrangements for the donations of bodies to anatomy schools.

Earlier this month, Irish premier, Enda Kenny, ordered ministers to see whether there are more mass baby graves after a researcher found records showing that 796 children, mostly infants, died in a home in Tuam, County Galway, which operated from 1925 until 1962.

Residents suspect they were interred in a nearby field, including in a disused septic tank.

Ireland had some 10 such mother-and-baby homes run by different orders until the 1960s.
