The best man accused of fatally stabbing his friend's wife had been faking cancer while ensnared by an investigation into thousands of dollars missing from his victim's company it’s been revealed.

Jonathan Broyhill told friends he was suffering from pancreatic cancer as well as multiple sclerosis for the last two years, according to friends and a reverend who were asked to ‘pray’ for him by his victims, Jamie and Nation Hahn.

Broyhill, 31, is currently hospitalized for self-inflicted injuries after authorities say he fatally stabbed 29-year-old Jamie Hahn in her North Raleigh home on Monday night.

Her husband Nation Hahn, 27, suffered minor lacerations while trying to defend her, according to police.

Last week the Hahns asked the Reverend Nancy Petty to pray for Broyhill during his cancer struggle, according to members of the Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh.

But on Wednesday, the day Jamie Hahn died from her injuries, Rev Petty informed about two dozen congregants that Broyhill did not have the disease.

‘I felt that I had an obligation to tell my congregation that this was not true and that there were more important things to pray for,’ Petty told WRAL.

Broyhill had worked for Jamie Hahn's 
political firm, Sky Blue Strategies, and was in charge of campaign 
financing and providing reports to the Financial Elections Commission, 
according to former Democratic Representative Brad Miller who used Sky 
Blue to help him with fundraising around 2010.

He told WRAP that Broyhill was the 
main employee who had access to the company’s fundraising software and 
may be part of a current investigation into thousands of dollars that 
has gone missing.

Several checks valued at $11,900 in April of 2012 alone were never received by the donors, according to WRAL.

‘I think it's bound to be part of the investigation of Jon's motive,’ Miller told the Island Packet on Wednesday.

On Monday friends say Broyhill told the Hahns that he had a doctor appointment the next day and asked if they'd come with him and if he could spend the night.

That appointment never existed, it’s now been revealed.

But so worried for his health, the request was welcomed and not uncommon according to neighbors of the Hahns who described Broyhill as seen practically living with them.

'It's there everyday,' neighbor Mars DElacuesta said of Hahn's car parked outside. 'I thought they lived together. That's his permanent parking spot over there.'

A former co-worker said Broyhill described himself as being on an aggressive medication for MS for the last two years.

She says she never saw changes in his behavior outside of a bit of depression.

‘He seemed depressed and I know he went through stress with MS,’ Amy Holsclaw told the Island Packet, ‘but other than that he was John, and John was a good guy.’

Broyhill, charged with attempted murder, was so close to the couple he dined at their house every week and even went on vacation with them, it has emerged.

Mr Hahn, a well-known strategist in North Carolina political circles, was released from WakeMed Hospital after treatment and was seen with a bandaged arm as he went to his wife's bedside on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he wrote a string of emotional tweets to pay tribute to his young wife.

'I have no idea what I'm going to do with @jamiehahn,' he wrote. 'She was my center, my rock and my soulmate... It is almost unfathomable that the sun can shine without [her] here.'

Friends told the Charlotte Observer how, on Monday nights, the three close friends would meet at the Hahn's home for dinner, but tragedy unfolded during this week's meet up.

An unidentified woman called 911 around 5.30pm Monday to report that Jamie was 'bleeding terribly' from multiple stab wounds to the abdomen as she lay in a neighbor's yard.

'I don't know where she ran here from,' the woman said, adding that many people had gathered to press towels against her stomach.

The dispatcher asked the caller who had carried out the stabbing, and a voice responded: 'Jon Broyhill', the Observer reported.

When police arrived on the scene, they followed a trail of blood back to Tealwood Place and found Broyhill inside the Hahns' home, authorities said.

Broyhill was also sent to WakeMed to 
recover from non-life threatening injuries, which are self-inflicted, according to WNCT.

Police have charged Broyhill with 
attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill 
inflicting serious injury, but have not revealed a motive.

Facebook images show the close 
relationship the three shared - enjoying watching sports games at home 
and traveling abroad to share holidays.

On Wednesday, the community paid tribute to the bright, popular woman, who had set up her own business, Sky Blue Strategies, to help politicians and campaigns fundraise.

She and her husband both graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and were married in 2009.

'Jamie lost her struggle to live this 
morning. We lost a beautiful and loving wife, daughter and friend. We 
all lost a pure and brave spirit,' her family said in a statement early on Wednesday morning.

'Jamie is a ray of sunshine,' state Sen.
 Josh Stein, who knew all three, said. 'She's always smiling. She 
absolutely brings cheer wherever she goes, and that this has happened is
 tragic.'

'As a friend, this is devastating,' 
friend Gary Pearce told the Observer. 'Nation and Jamie are the finest, 
kindest, gentlest and most generous people you will ever meet.'

Following the tragedy, Nation Hahn talked about his wife at Pullen Memorial.

'She would be the first one to forgive this act of violence against her,' he said.

According to the Observer, in 2010 
Broyhill also managed the field campaign for Jane Dyer, a pilot in South 
Carolina who was running for a U.S. congressional seat.

He also worked with former U.S. Rep. Brad Miller of Raleigh.

Nation Hahn worked on former U.S. Sen. John Edwards' presidential campaign and has also helped as an online strategist and with mail campaigns.

Among those he's worked with is the Coalition to Protect All N.C. Families, a campaign opposed to the state constitutional amendment that limits marriage to a union between a man and a woman.
