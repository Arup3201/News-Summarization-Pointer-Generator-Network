A street vendor in India got the shock of his life when he found a two-week-old baby inside a bag he stole hoping it contained cash.

Kishor Kale, 20, was selling nail polish to women on a train journey, from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Belapur, in Mumbai, India, when he noticed an abandoned bag sitting on the side of a carriage.

Hoping it had money and other valuables inside, Mr Kale picked up the bag and exited the train.

The two-week-old baby boy was abandoned in a bag on a train, before the bag was stolen by Kishnor Kale and then abandoned again

But when Mr Kale later unzipped the green bag on the station platform he found a baby’s hand reach out to him.

Shocked, Mr Kale tried to flee and further abandon the little baby but a vigilant station ticket collector caught him.

Soon, a crowd assembled and everyone was staring at the adorable 15-day-old baby sleeping inside the bag.

The police arrived and detained Mr Kale thinking he was abandoning his own baby. They are now investigating the story.

Police officer Hanuman Kharat, of Wadala Railway Police Station, said: 'We’re investigating the case and we’re using Mr Kale to help us recreate the scene and find the baby’s real family.'

Police are also using CCTV footage to find out who exactly abandoned the bag on the train.

Mr Kharat said: 'We are also speaking to maternity hospitals in the area to find out who has given birth to boys this week.'

Doctors at the Bhabha Hospital, in Mumbai, quickly declared the baby healthy and he was temporarily sent to Asha Sadan – a children’s home in Mumbai.

Mrs Vijaya Moorthy, an official at the home, confirmed they were taking care of the boy.

The police officer said Mr Kale has inadvertently saved the life of the baby boy.

'He could’ve died inside the bag if Mr Kale had not mistaken the bag’s weight for money,' Mr Kharat said. 'Things happen in mysterious ways.'
