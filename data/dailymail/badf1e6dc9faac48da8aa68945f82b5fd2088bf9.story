They say a pot of gold lies at the end of every rainbow - but finding a hoard of 200-year-old silver in a pile of rubbish has got to be almost as unlikely.

That's exactly what lucky gardener Chris Allen did when he decided to clear up litter dumped near his allotment in Derbyshire.

While he was removing the plastic bags the bottom fell out of one to reveal a collection of high quality Georgian silverware worth hundreds of pounds.

Hoard: Gardener Chris Allen could not believe his luck when he found this stash of beautiful silverware in a bag of rubbish

Sparkling: The collection included an assortment of decorative dinnerware

The haul included a 48-piece dinner service of dessert spoons, dessert forks, table forks, and serving spoons, as well as grape scissors, a mustard spoon a pearl-handled button hook and solid silver shoe horn.

Honest Mr Allen, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, handed it all in to police as lost property back in March but it went unclaimed.

He decided to auction the collection off, and split the proceeds between two charities - the Derbyshire Air Ambulance and Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station, in Wales, where he and wife Noreen often holiday.

'As I picked up one of the bags the bottom fell out and what I had assumed to be a bag full of rubbish turned out to be a carrier bag full of Georgian silver,” said Chris, a former Marine.

'I was of course amazed to think that these beautiful pieces of silver had been lying forgotten in a field and I took them all immediately to the police station.

'It was the summer we had in March and I was working in the field and there was just polystyrene and chip wrappers lying about.

'I thought while it was nice it’s a shame for it to make a mess, so I thought I’ll just tidy the place up a little bit. I picked up this carrier bag and it burst and all this silver fell out.'

Honest: Mr Allen took the hoard to the police in case the owner came forward - but was eventually given it back. Among the items found was a silver shoehorn (pictured)

Mr Allen continued to try to find the owner of the silver after nobody came forward to claim it from the police.

'I carried on making inquiries on the internet and on our local radio and in our local newspaper, but still no one seemed to know anything about the silver,' he said.

'I decided then to do something worthwhile with my find and took the whole lot of silver to be auctioned at our local auctioneers Fiddler and Taylor.'

Mr Allen said the auctioneers were so impressed with his story that they did not charge any commission. 

Generous: He eventually auctioned off the collection and donated the money to charity. Here Mr Allen (left, holding the cheque) and his wife Noreen (far left) hand over a cheque for £400 to Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station

The items were sold off to collectors in different lots and the silver eventually made £530 at auction, with donations bringing the total up to £800.

'My wife Noreen and I love coming to Aberdyfi on holiday so we decided to donate half the amount - £400 - to Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station and the other £400 to our home Air Ambulance of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland,' said Mr Allen.

'We are very pleased that this unexpected find will benefit some very worthwhile causes and we would also like to thank everyone who made a donation.'

Dave Williams, operations manager of Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station, said: '[We] are especially pleased that Chris and Noreen Allen wanted to give something to Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station with the proceeds from this very unexpected find and we are very grateful to them.'
