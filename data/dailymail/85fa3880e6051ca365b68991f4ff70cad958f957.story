Slices of cheese served outside the bun, meatless burgers, unusually small ice cream sundaes and poor presentation are among the 'failures' of McDonalds that have enraged Australian customers.

The so-called fast food dinner dramas have led to some taking to Twitter and Facebook with their dining disasters and posting under the #maccasfail hashtag.

Customer photos and amusing comments have inundated social media, drawing attention to various slip ups from McDonalds' stores and staff.

Among the complaints on the #maccasfail hashtag is the Facebook user who was outraged by the size of his sundaes

This woman who ordered a soft serve ice cream 'in a cup not a cone'. This is what she claims she got.

This woman's son won a free chicken wrap voucher at his school. 'Check out his prize. Thanks Maccas #Fail #Maccasfail',' she tweeted

A plain cheeseburger does not mean a burger without the meat, argued this #maccasfail customer

One of them is a woman who ordered a soft serve ice cream 'in a cup not a cone'. She allegedly got more than she bargained for when staff simply placed the ice cream and cone inside a sundae cup.

To the amusement of one customer at an inner-Sydney store, he was told by a young female staff member that 'McDonald's Camperdown doesn't serve red meat'.

'I bet poor girl serving gets sick of explaining that 2 disgruntled carnivores!' he tweeted.

It took this man one bite before he realised he was missing an essential part of his cheeseburger ... the beef patty

Needless to say this man was less than impressed with the way his burger was presented to him

'Thanks for the burger McDonalds' was all this man had to say when he tucked into his food

A man who had been waiting in line at a McDonalds' store for 10 minutes says the girls standing behind him were outrageously served first.

'Yes they were hot... oh wait now I see why #maccasfail,' he tweeted.

A boy who won a free chicken wrap voucher at his school was given just a piece of chicken that took up a quarter of the entire wrap.

This man declared #maccasfail war when he realised he'd been given a half-empty fries

A woman was highly amused to find her bit-sized muffin needed a huge bag to hold it

He ordered a sausage and egg McMuffin, so when he bit into this he knew there was something noticeably missing

'The tide is out' according to this customer, who wasn't given a full cup of coke

This was a so-called #maccasfail for not looking anything like the picture
