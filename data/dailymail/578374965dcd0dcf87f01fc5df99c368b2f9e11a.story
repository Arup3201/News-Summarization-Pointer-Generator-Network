Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert has launched an elaborate marketing campaign in a bid to sell her cosy New Jersey mansion for $999,000.

The 44-year-old's four-bedroom abode appears on a dedicated website called 'Eat, Pray, Crib,'  which carries a tagline styled after that of her best-seller - 'One woman's journey to sell her house.'

There is also a nearly 20-minute long YouTube video, where Ms Gilbert gives viewers a private tour of the 'handsome' property, pointing out key features such as a 1,400sq ft 'Skybrary' - a 'library in the sky' - and a wine cellar fit for 500 bottles.

Giving viewers a grand tour: Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert has launched an elaborate marketing campaign in a bid to sell her cosy New Jersey mansion for $999,000

She eloquently writes in an accompanying blurb: 'Because I'm a restless person and I need to move all the time.

'It's time to move, then! Otherwise, there is no sane reason to sell this exquisite and lovingly renovated "four-over-four" Italianate Victorian house that was built in 1869 by the great-grandson of John Reading (the first governor of New Jersey and a hero of the Revolutionary War.)'

Up for grabs: The 44-year-old's four-bedroom abode appears on a dedicated website called 'Eat, Pray, Crib,'  which carries a tagline styled after that of her best-seller - 'One woman's journey to sell her house'

Marital home: Ms Gilbert has lived in the home for six years with her husband, JosÃ© Nunes - the Brazilian importer she met in Bali on her East, Pray, Love odyssey - and their dog Rocky

Keen cooks: The country kitchen features a breakfast island and a wood-burning stove 

She says that her 'Syybary', located in the attic, is her favorite room because it has a 'napping bed for extra creative energy' and '360 degree views.'

It apparently took a 'master woodworker' more than three years to complete.

On the ground floor there is an office, 'country kitchen' complete with a wood-burning stove, living room, dining room and library.

Moving upstairs there are four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a 'secret' back staircase leading to the kitchen.

Rustic: The home has two-and-a-half bathrooms - this one features bright blue paint and a Victorian-style bath

Key feature: Ms Gilbert says that her Syybary, located in the attic, is her favorite room because it has a 'napping bed for extra creative energy' and '360 degree views'

Room for all: Ms Gilbert says the property is private enough for two people to 'live in utter seclusion, but welcoming enough to absorb a giant and warm family reunion without anyone being crowded'

Outside Ms Gilbert says the lawn is perfect for summer parties and the patio area has
 a woodstove which is ideal for cozy evenings in winter.

Ms Gilbert has lived in the home for six years with her husband, JosÃ© Nunes -
 the Brazilian importer she met in Bali on her East, Pray, Love odyssey -
 and their dog Rocky.

It is where she penned her books Committed and The Signature of All Things.

The best-selling author concludes: 'This property is a piece of heaven, in the quietest and most romantic corner of the state.

'It is private enough for two people to live in utter seclusion, but welcoming enough to absorb a giant and warm family reunion without anyone being crowded.

Career-breaker: Ms Gilbert is best known for her 2006 memoir, Eat, Pray, Love, which was made into a film by the same name in 2010 starring Julia Roberts (pictured)

'This is a home for readers, writers, artists, creatives, collectors, inventors, gardeners, dreamers, imaginative children, lovers of beauty.

'We've spent six years making every inch of this special place absolutely perfect and gorgeous, but now we are now moving on to the next chapter of our lives!'

She and her husband plan to downsize and move nearer to Two Buttons. the Pan-Asian emporium they own in the heart of Frenchtown, New Jersey.
