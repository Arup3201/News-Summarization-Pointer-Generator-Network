Iker Casillas was dropped for Real Madrid's La Liga clash against Elche on Tuesday night, after a string of poor performances.

The out-of form Spanish keeper has even been turned on by his own fans in recent weeks, who booed Real's  captain during their last home league game - the 2-1 defeat to arch-rivals Atletico Madrid.

Casillas was replaced in goal by Keylor Navas for the Elche match and was informed of the decision after training on Monday.

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti told his squad that he wants to implement a rotation policy in the coming weeks, with the captain being one of those to make way against Elche.

Last season, Casillas only played two league games, as he battled it out with the now departed Diego Lopez to be the club's first-choice keeper.

Casillas, who has won 157 caps for Spain, endured a poor World Cup as well as an indifferent start to this season, but was defended by club president Florentino Perez at the club's general assembly.

Perez said: 'Iker Casillas deserves our respect. He's the best goalkeeper in the club's history and does not deserve the whistles he has received. 

'We must unite to protect each other. Our strength lies in unity.'
