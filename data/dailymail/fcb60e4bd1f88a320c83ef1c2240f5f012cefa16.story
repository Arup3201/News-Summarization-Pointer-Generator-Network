Glasgow winger Sean Lamont has been ruled out of Scotland's remaining RBS 6 Nations games with a knee injury.

Lamont suffered the injury during Glasgow's 26-5 win over Zebre in the Guinness Pro12 on Friday night.

He has been replaced in the squad by fellow Glasgow winger Sean Maitland, who missed Scotland's opening three defeats in the tournament with a shoulder problem.

Edinburgh forward Stuart McInally also comes into the squad ahead of the Calcutta Cup match against England at Twickenham on Saturday as cover for hooker Ross Ford, who is fighting to overcome the back spasm he suffered against Italy.

The 24-year-old has scored three tries in seven appearances for Edinburgh this season and started at hooker during their weekend win over Treviso after being converted from a number eight. 

Glasgow back Peter Horne is also being monitored by the Scotland medical team after suffering concussion against Zebre.
