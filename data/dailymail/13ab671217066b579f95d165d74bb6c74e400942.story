Those at the vigil today included Spike Grant, 51, who crossed the road just before the crash on Monday.

He said: 'We were there on the day and had just crossed the road. It was like firecrackers going off. We turned to look and saw the lorry coming up with debris flying off the back.

'I went back and helped a doctor with a young girl, a lassie who was 14 and is still in hospital.

'Half a second earlier and it could have been us. We just wanted to come down today to pay our respects.'

People were visibly upset as they took part in the candle-lit vigil, with some openly crying as they held a two-minute silence for the six dead

Heather Purcell, 47, who was with him that day, said: 'I feel so sorry for the families. It makes you feel blessed that you are here and have your life in front of you.

'It was so surreal and it still seems like that sometimes.' 

David McCallum, 21, who runs the Support the George Square Crash page, set up a similar page following the Clutha helicopter crash in November 2013, which left ten people dead.

Mr McCallum said: 'I didn't know any of the victims personally but I made a Clutha support page last year and that got such a good response with a lot of people saying it had helped them so I wanted to do the same for this. 

'I just like the idea of everyone coming together - if this helps anyone come to terms with it and deal with it and helps then I think it is worth doing.

'The turnout has been amazing. It's unreal, considering that it's the Sunday before New Year and after Christmas when people have go so many other things to do and yet they're taking the time to come here for an hour to show their support.

'It's amazing that they're doing that for no other reason than just to show support and help out.

'The flower tributes which have been laid throughout the week are just wonderful, it's just really touching.'

Self-employed clothes maker Ainsley Black, 23, from Greenock, said she brought flowers after she saw the aftermath on Monday.

She said: 'I was in Glasgow on Monday and although I didn't see the accident itself, I saw the immediate aftermath, it was so horrible and sad.

'We came today to pay our respects to the six who died and everyone who was affected by it.

'The turnout has been amazing, a bit overwhelming and very emotional to see so many people out.

'It's been a good tribute to those affected by the tragedy.'

Pensioner Ann Wood, 70, from Glasgow, said she also wanted to lay flowers and pay her respects.

She said: 'I just wanted to show my respect to those who died and express my sympathy for the people affected.

'The turnout has really shown that Glasgow people do stick together through it all.

'When I first heard I thought it was simply terrible. I couldn't even believe it at the time because you just don't expect something like that to happen so close to Christmas.

'But the response and turnout from everyone has been brilliant. Glasgow knows how to come together when there's a crisis.

'The last time I saw as many tributes as this was when Princess Diana died.

'It's even bigger than the tributes laid after the Clutha, it's that terrible.'

A sea of candles and bunches of flowers fill the square as the city struggles to come to terms with the tragic incident

The crowd lit candles and held a two minute silence at 2.30pm today to mark the moment six people died on Monday afternoon

Police have estimated that between 1,000 and 1,500 people attended the vigil.

The victims of the crash have been remembered at Christmas services across the city, with candles lit and prayers said for all those affected by the tragedy.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon intends to personally thank those who dealt with the incident in the coming days and weeks.

A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The First Minister extends her sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who died in George Square. 

'She also wishes a speedy recovery to those who are still being treated in hospital.

 'Our immediate priority is to allow health professionals to continue to care for people who were injured, and to give those who lost loved ones the time and space to grieve. 

'The First Minister is extremely grateful to the health workers and first responders who dealt so admirably with this difficult tragedy. She intends to thank them personally over the coming days and weeks.'

Erin McQuade, 18, and her grandparents 68-year-old Jack and 69-year-old Lorraine Sweeney, all from Dumbarton, died in the accident.

Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, and tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the council truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel in George Square. 

Mr and Mrs Sweeney's nephew  has said he does not blame the driver for their deaths and hopes he 'makes a speedy recovery'.

In a series of online messages, Marc Gardiner thanked the emergency services for doing everything possible for his family.

He also urged people not to criticise the driver of the lorry that ploughed in to pedestrians in the city centre and said the messages of support received by the family had meant a lot.

Erin's mother Jacqueline, 43, is thought to have survived because she had gone to withdraw money from a cash machine during the family's Christmas shopping trip.

Relatives of the Sweeneys and Glasgow University student Miss McQuade, who are from Dumbarton, north west of Glasgow, spoke of their loss on Facebook after being told about the crash.

John Sweeney wrote: 'No words can describe the pain. R.I.P. Jack, Lorraine and Erin. Thoughts and prayers go out to the other families that lost loved ones as well — feeling heartbroken.'

Bosses at Cameron House Hotel in Loch Lomond, where Miss McQuade worked, paid tribute to 'one of our brightest members of staff', who was in the first year of an English Literature degree. 

Tributes were also paid to teacher Miss Tait, who was a popular member of staff at St Philomena's Primary in Provanmill, eastern Glasgow.

Headteacher Catherine Gallagher said: 'The entire school community is deeply saddened by this tragic news.'

Ms Gallagher added: 'Stephenie was an excellent young teacher, dedicated to the children. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends at this time.

'We will be supporting colleagues in every way possible. Stephenie made a wonderful contribution to the life of St Philomena's. She will be sadly missed by both pupils and staff.'

One of her former pupils added, on Facebook: 'Can't believe your gone Rip Miss Tait you were such an amazing teacher shine bright.'

Former pupils posted messages of condolence on Twitter, describing her as a 'fantastic' and 'amazing' teacher who would be 'sadly missed'

Neighbours at Miss Ewing’s family home in Mortonhall, Edinburgh, said she had moved to Cyprus with her partner several years ago and had only returned recently for Christmas.

The mother of two worked in hospitality and often planned weddings and big events for people. Her younger daughter, Lucy, still lives in the family home while her other daughter, Robyn, has moved away.
