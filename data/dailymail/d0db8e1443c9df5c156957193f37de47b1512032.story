Mystery: The naked and decomposing corpse of Gareth Williams, a fit 31-year-old, was discovered in his home in central London in August 2010

MI6 spy Gareth Williams tied himself up in a bizarre game several years before he was found dead in a sports bag, a coroners’ court heard yesterday.

The secret agent was discovered wearing just his boxer shorts by his landlady after shouting ‘help’ because he could not escape.

Jennifer Elliot, 71, said his wrists were tightly strapped to the headboard of his bed in her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire and her husband used a knife to cut him free.

Mr Williams said he was ‘just messing about’ and vowed never to do it again.

The episode took place three years before police discovered Mr Williams’s naked body padlocked inside a bag in the bath of his home.

It will fuel speculation that the high-flying and reclusive code-breaker died in a sex game that went disastrously wrong.

The third day of the inquest into the riddle of his death was dominated by fresh disclosures about the 31-year-old’s private life.

It heard he viewed fetish websites aimed at those aroused by confined spaces, as well as bondage and sado-masochism, on his laptop.

A shop assistant revealed he regularly bought expensive clothing for his ‘tall and slim’ girlfriend but police have found no evidence of a sexual partner.

A friend said she believed Mr Williams was ‘straight’ and not interested
in cross-dressing despite owning wigs, make-up and a £20,000 collection
of women’s clothes.

Businesswoman Elizabeth Guthrie, 27, one of Mr Williams’s  few close 
friends, revealed he used an alias and had several phones.

Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox has said that 
whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one 
and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry'

She said they
enjoyed staying in at her Knightsbridge flat and watching DVD box sets.

The most extraordinary revelation came in a statement by Mrs Elliot who 
rented a flat in her home to the computer science expert for more than a
decade while he worked at the GCHQ listening station.

Mrs Elliot said 
Mr Williams was polite but extremely private and she could only remember
one occasion on which friends had called for him.

One night in 2007 she and her husband Brian were woken by the sound of him shouting for assistance at about 1.30am.

They used a spare key to get into the flat and found Mr Williams tightly
bound by each wrist to wooden ‘bobbles’ at either side of the bed’s 
headboard. She said he was wearing only boxer shorts and had used some 
kind of material, not rope or plastic, which had cut deeply into his 
flesh. Mrs Elliot said: ‘My husband said, “What the bloody hell are you 
doing?” He said he just wanted to try and get free.

‘My husband cut him free. He then said, “Gareth, we can’t have you doing
this”. Gareth apologised and said it would not happen again and offered
to pay more money.

‘We have never spoken to anyone about it since. We both felt it was more
likely to be sexual than escapology or similar but could not be sure.

The flat was immaculate and I never saw anything of a sexual or fetish 
nature.’

The mystery surrounding Mr Williams’s death has perplexed Scotland Yard’s best detectives during a 20-month inquiry.

They have been unable to definitively prove how and when he died and 
whether anyone else was involved before he was found at his flat in 
Pimlico, Central London, in August 2010.

The detective leading the inquiry is convinced that someone else 
padlocked Mr Williams in the bag or hoisted it into the bath where it 
was found.

In her evidence Miss Guthrie said the pair planned to attend a fancy dress ball dressed as Japanese cartoon characters.

Asked if Mr Williams was interested in cross-dressing, she said: 
‘Nothing of a sexual bent but we were going to a fancy dress ball 
together. He was going as a ninja, not as a queen.’

It also emerged yesterday that a novel found in Mr Williams’s flat, 
Morvern Callar by Alan Warner, has a plot with some similarities to his 
death.

In the book a shelf-packer in Oban, Scotland, finds her 
semi-clothed boyfriend dead after he commits suicide.

She cuts up his 
decomposing body and stuffs it in a rucksack.

Mr Williams’s immediate boss at MI6 came under fire from a barrister 
representing his family for failing to raise the alarm more quickly when
he went missing.

The senior intelligence officer did not act as a ‘reasonable, careful 
and responsible’ manager, Westminster Coroners’ Court was told.

The spy,
who gave evidence from behind a screen and was known only as ‘Witness 
G’, denied he knew something ‘horrible’ had happened to Mr Williams.

He 
said: ‘In hindsight I should have taken more action more quickly and 
escalated it.’

At the hearing a female member of Mr Williams’s family collapsed and could be heard hyperventilating behind the screens.

The inquest continues.

Being tracked? Mr Williams is caught on CCTV in Holland Park on August 14, 2010, just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his Pimlico flat

Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence
