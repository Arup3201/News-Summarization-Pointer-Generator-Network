A British teenager who was stabbed in a row over a handbag in a Turkish shop is lucky to be alive, surgeons said today after battling for more ten hours to save him.

Callum Copson from Kennoway, near St
 Andrews, suffered a massive wound to his stomach after being slashed with a knife while protecting his girlfriend on holiday.

The 19-year-old was said to be on the 'road to recovery' after two life-saving operations, although doctors warned he is 'not out of the woods yet'.

Consultant surgeon Ozgur Basaran said: 'Callum is lucky to be young, to be that close to the hospital and to receive immediate treatment to his wounds.

'He had suffered extensive and severe damage to the major arteries serving his kidneys and other internal organs.

'We
 worked for seven hours to repair the damage. But he later suffered 
further internal bleeding and we had to operate a second time.'

Mr
 Copson suffered a massive wound to his stomach and had to squash his 
intestines back inside with his own hands after being sliced with the 
jagged edge of a fruit knife after a row over a handbag.

He had jumped in to protect his girlfriend Erin Brown, 18, after angry shop
 staff started lobbing belts, bags and shoes at her following a row 
over a refund on a faulty bag last week.

But
 as Callum stepped in to shield Erin from the onslaught a 14-year-old 
local boy snatched up a knife, dashed into the shop and plunged the 
blade into Mr Copson's stomach then fled.

British
 tourists tried to help stem the flow of blood as the shocked Scottish 
teenager clutched his stomach and begged for help.

Eye-witness
 Sandra Dempsey, 54, said: 'There was blood everywhere. You could see 
his insides spewing out. It was unbelievably shocking.

'The poor lad just
 kept repeating "I don't want to die" over and over.'

Following the surgery, Mr Copson was put into an induced coma for 48 hours. 

On Sunday, he was bought out of the coma and taken off oxygen and was able to breathe for himself.

But he remains in intensive care at the private Ahu Hetman Hospital in Marmaris.

'I'm pleased to say that Callum is well on the road to recovery,' added Dr Basaran. 

But
 the private surgeon added a note of caution saying: 'He's not out of 
the woods yet - but he's young and strong and making good progress.'

His
 parents Eric and Lorraine Copson, who flew to Turkey to be at their 
son's bedside, told local reporters: 'As soon as we got the call to say 
Callum was hurt we left our two daughters with family and got on the 
first plane to Marmaris.

'I'm delighted that our son is alive and improving,' said Mr Copson.

'We'd
 like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the fabulous doctors and 
nurses who have worked so very hard to save Callum's life - words alone 
cannot express our gratitude to them.'

Callum Copson's parents Eric and Lorraine have rushed from their home in Leven, near St Andrews to join a bedside vigil for the teen

He added: 'We came on a family holiday here four years ago and Callum just fell in love with the place.

'He decided to come back with his girlfriend Erin because he just loved Marmaris so much.'

The furious row erupted in a leather shop in the popular tourist resort of Marmaris last Wednesday night.

The
 couple were staying at the Amore Hotel, had bought a bag in the shop on
 Monday - but realising it was faulty returned to the shop a couple of 
days later.

Ms Brown told police: 'I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible but that I could pick a replacement bag.

'When I picked a bag the owner said it was too expensive so I asked for a refund again and that's when the argument started.'

Following the attack, 14-year-old Mehmet Karabulut was taken to the police station by his father who works in the bag shop.

Karabulut,

 who, according to family friends, has mental-health issues, told his 
father and the police that he could remember holding a blood stained 
knife, 
but nothing more.

He was remanded in custody by a judge who has ordered a psychiatric evaluation of the troubled teen.

Family
 friend Nadir Koyunbakan said: 'Mehmet has some psychiatric problems. He
 snatched the knife and stabbed the British boy when he saw him arguing 
with his boss.

'We are 
devastated for Callum Copson and his family. They are guests in Turkey 
and this should never have happened. We are so very sorry.'
