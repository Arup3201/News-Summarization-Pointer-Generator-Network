Virginia Senator Creigh Deeds today showed how he is continuing to heal four months after his son brutally stabbed him before killing himself at the family's home.

But speaking at the National Press Club, the 56-year-old admitted that the red scars across his face have helped him remind fellow politicians of the importance of mental healthcare reform in his state.

'Nobody lost sight of our incredible 
needs in the area of mental health, not this session when I was there 
every day with scars and tears,' he told the crowd in Washington, D.C.

'I was red-eyed and red-faced â€“ that kept it in the forefront. My scars aren't going away.'

Healing: Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds speaks at the National Press Club in Washington on Monday showing the scars inflicted by his son, who had been turned away from psychiatric care the day before

Fighter: Deeds, pictured on Monday, is now pushing the Virginia legislature for mental health-care reform

Deeds was attacked by his 24-year-old son, Gus, on November 19 - just a day after he was turned away from state-run psychiatric care.

Gus, a talented musician and top student at William and 
Mary, was diagnosed as bipolar when he was 21, and last November his 
father became worried he would kill himself.

He gained a court 
order to take his son to the emergency room to check him into a 
psychiatric ward, but the court order expired after six hours. In that 
time, staff had not been able to find him a bed.

So instead, he was simply sent home with his father, which concerned Deeds.

Deeds woke up the next day expecting his son to be upset, but he never could have imagined the violent scene that followed.

Rural: The attack took place in Deeds' Millboro, Virginia home, pictured. The senator was able to stumble to the road where he was found by a neighbor - but his son went back to the house and shot himself dead

'I
 got ready for work, and I went out to the barn to feed the horses, and 
Gus was coming across the yard and... I said, "Hey, bud, how'd you 
sleep?"' he told CBS earlier this year. 'He said, "Fine."

'I turned my back and... had this feed thing in my hands and he was just on me... He got me twice.'

In fact, Deeds suffered 10 stab wound, including those to his face.

Following
 the frenzied attack, Deeds stumbled into the road where he was found by
 a neighbor and rushed to hospital. But his son returned to the house 
and shot himself dead.

Despite the attack, on Monday, Deeds fought back the tears as he said that he refused to blame his 'perfect son' for the incident.

Determined: Deeds' scars are much more prominent as he appears outside the Senate Education and Health Subcommittee on Mental Health in January. He is fighting to improve mental health-care standards

Determined: On Monday, he said that the scars made it hard for lawmakers to forget the issue

'In every sense of the word my son was my hero,' Deeds said, explaining how kind and smart his son was. 'I think what happened was a system failure.'

He went on: 'Events last fall took my son, but I survived. I hope the result of my surviving is that my son will remembered for his living, not his dying,' he said, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Since returning to work, Deeds has pushed through the implementation of an online registry showing available spaces in Virginia facilities. If a private facility bed canâ€™t be found, a hospital bed must 
be.

A four-year study of Virigina's mental health
 system is also being carried out.

Deeds also said there national issues need to be addressed, including medical confidentiality laws that prevented him from knowing the details of his son's diagnosis and treatment.
