Barry O’Driscoll’s phone suffered a meltdown the other week. He was in Tenerife on holiday, enjoying a sports-free Friday night in the Spanish tourist mecca, when he received the same advice from numerous people. 

Check out the Florian Fritz incident in the Toulouse versus Racing Metro match was the suggestion. He did and what he saw appalled him.

Rugby across the board is supposed to have cottoned on to the fact that concussion is no good for any player and a concussed player is no good for any team, but what happened at Stade Ernest Wallon made a complete mockery of the supposedly-increased surveillance.

Protest: Barry O'Driscoll resigned as IRB medical advisor due to its introduction of a five-minute concussion bin

Although bloodied and clearly unsteady on his feet when being taken off following a scary collision between his head and a Racing player’s knee, Fritz was patched up and eventually sent back into the fray at the behest of his coach Guy Noves, who was shown by the television cameras at the door of the medical room pressurising his staff and player to get a move on.

Fritz played six more minutes before common sense finally prevailed. He would not return for the second half.

‘It was horrific,’ says O’Driscoll, adding that sort of impact to the head can cause damage to the brain. ‘That is the sort of thing the IRB, even with their protocol, are not going to be able to control if it is a vital game.’

The medical expert insists power of TV and the huge influence of the commercial side of the game focuses on the glory for a club and not player welfare.

It’s not the only development this month that has concerned O’Driscoll, though. It’s nearly two years now since he resigned as a leading IRB medical advisor due to its introduction of the controversial five-minute concussion bin.

That trial had its notable malfunctions, most infamously the sorry sight of the Wallabies sending George Smith back into battle against the Lions last July when he was in no fit state to do so following a head collision with Richard Hibbard.

However, O’Driscoll  was left gobsmacked the other week when the IRB hailed its experiment a success in forcing a drop in the number of concussed players returning to the field of play.

But more depressingly for the former Irish international, he learnt that the pitchside concussion assessment [PSCA] will now double in duration from five to 10 minutes to accommodate altered balance and memory tests. 

O’Driscoll still vehemently insists — as he has always done — that the policy should be zero tolerance. Nothing else. That if a player is recognised as showing concussion symptoms he is taken off and that’s it.

No second chance because a five-minute or the soon-to-be 10-minute check is, in his belief, simply not sufficient when dealing with the grey matter of a brain injury. 

‘There needs to be zero tolerance on this, not varying degrees if you show signs you are concussed. Pure and simple,’ he insisted. ‘Doing a five-minute or a 10-minute assessment, it becomes completely arbitrary. The IRB have confused and trivialised concussion.

‘The experts still don’t know exactly the full significance of concussion but every bit of research that is coming out is really bad news.

‘There can be no messing about with the brain.

‘It’s frightening how little we do know about the brain, but there has been no bit of good news at all about the short or long-term effects of concussion.

‘To say rugby has got a couple of tests on the touchline, that we will get you to stand up straight for a few minutes and clear you, that’s just the wrong way to go about it. 

‘It just really frustrates me. People are playing their own agenda on this, whether it is a club agenda or a player agenda or a doctor agenda, and that is because the IRB has given them the opportunity… and now they have given them another layer.

‘They had got five minutes and now they are getting 10 minutes. They have got potential concussion, they have got suspected concussion, four or five different levels and they can get away with it [clearing a player to return to play].

‘The whole thing is arbitrary now for all different reasons. Different coaches, different clubs making different decisions on the same situations. That has only got one end point, zero tolerance.’

O’Driscoll continues to have no regrets about quitting and going public with his concerns over the PSCA trial.

In the high-powered world of “mercs and perks” sports administration, it’s rare for someone to go cold turkey but O’Driscoll was driven by his conscience and will continue to do so despite becoming a persona non grata in the eyes of his former colleagues.

‘I miss very much a lot of the people there and a lot of the work I was doing there, just discipline and medicine, but I can sleep at night.’

He’ll sleep even more soundly after this weekend knowing his nephew — Leinster’s Brian O’Driscoll — will have finally hung up the boots and won’t be exposed to any more potential concussions.

‘I’m glad Brian is finishing. For all sorts of reasons he has been an incredible player, one of the best players the world has ever seen. He has carried himself as an example to everybody but he has taken a lot of knocks and I’m just glad he is finishing his tremendous career now. There’s nothing left for him to achieve.’
