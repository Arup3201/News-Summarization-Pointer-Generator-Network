Police have recorded their own crime-fighting version of Silent Night in a call for peace over the Christmas holidays.

Four PCSOs from Huddersfield South Neighbourhood Policing Team wrote and recorded their own version of the carol in a local studio in their spare time over a melodic piano backing track.

The song, complete with a video of a burglar being apprehended by Yorkshire police, was released on YouTube exactly 12 days before Christmas.

Twist: Two of Huddersfield's police officers appear in the video 'Silent night/Crime to fight'

Festive season: The video, recorded in a local studio, was released at midnight 12 days before Christmas

The peculiar parody, the brainchild of PCSOs Paul Simpkins, Jon Arey, Morgan Cockroft and Chris McNamara, is the latest gimmick from the nation's crime-fighters.

It comes as a force in Wigan, Lancashire, sends Christmas cards to serial offenders, urging them to be good over the festive period.

Inspector Danny Groiser, of Huddersfield South NPT, said: 'I was approached by Paul, Jon and Morgan about doing something like this.

'I set them a challenge to see if they could come up with a crime prevention themed song for Christmas.

Storyline: The PCSOs are seen lecturing a burglar who tried to steal presents and run away

Mood: At times, the lighting and angles of the camera are positioned to be ominous

'I am stunned by the results and am very proud of their efforts.

'All of the work was done in their own time and the end result is something which gets a strong crime prevention message across in a fun and quirky, and suitably seasonal way.'

PCSO Jon Arey, said: 'We always like to use different means of getting a positive crime prevention message out there to raise awareness.

'We thought using Silent Night would really work - it's a carol which is familiar but hearing a version with changed lyrics would also make people smile a bit and help us get a point across.'

Sneaking: The man is seen as a shadow. The leader of the force said he was happy to invest time in this

Moral: At the end the burglar is caught and taken into the station. They hope the message will spread

The card from Wigan police officers, with two policemen in a tinsel-topped patrol car, warns there will be no festive holiday and police will still come for them if they step out of line.

Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: 'Our card will be issued to known criminals who will also get a personal visit from our teams to remind them that we won't be taking our eyes off them, even during the festive period.

'We would like offenders to put these cards on their mantelpiece as a constant reminder that we are on their case and will take any offending very seriously.'
