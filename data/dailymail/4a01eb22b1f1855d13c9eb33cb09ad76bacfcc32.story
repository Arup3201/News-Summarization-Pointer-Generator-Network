They are worn by royalty and rock stars, gold-medal-winning Olympic athletes and people who have never even run for a bus.

Now the trainer - essential footwear every day for billions around the world - is to have its own exhibition charting its rise to iconic status.

Forty pairs will go on display at the London show, Sneaking Into Fashion - Tracking the trainer's Journey through Popular Culture.

The exhibition, put on by Javari.co.uk, explores
the footwear from the 1920s when they were called sneakers through to 
today and their role in modern society, reports the Observer.

On show are a pair of Nike Volts worn by double Olympic champion Mo Farrah at the 2012 Games contrasted with the pair worn by Roger Bannister when he ran the first under 4-minute mile in 1950.

There
are pairs from the private collections of Brit Pop pioneers Noel and 
Liam Gallagher, to the last pair designed collaboratively by Vivienne 
Westwood and Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren.

Uma Thurman's yellow Asics Onitsuka Tiger Mexico-style trainers from her martial arts movie Kill Bill are featured along with a pair of Buffalo platforms favoured by Spice girl Mel B at the Brit awards in 1998.

Liam Howlett of The Prodigy wore a pair of Double Identity trainers while on tour during the Nineties. They are on display held together by gaffer tape.

Tory Turk, curator of the show to be 
staged from October 18 to 28th at the Market Building in the Covent Garden Piazza, said trainers had always been popular but were currently having a 'high fashion' moment.

She told writer Karen Kay: 'The unique 
collection I've chosen tells the story of the development of trainers 
from generic plimsolls to fashion staple - a cornerstone of popular 
culture sport and style.'

Speaking to the Mail Online, Miss Turk said: 'The show is about love for trainers both personal and cultural. Each pair has a story behind it.'

'Trainers have been popular for years but now they have hit a high fashion moment.'

Miss Turk, fashion curator for two years, owns 15 pairs and wears Nike Air Max in greens or yellows every day.

A 1980s pair of Gucci tennis trainers represent the first fashion brand to incorporate a functional sports shoe into its luxury collection, while a pair of Vans from the 1960s designed by artist Peter Max represents the first convening of art and sport.

Today a collectable and coveted trainers such as Kanye West’s ‘Yeezys’ were sold for  $90,000 at auction earlier this year, whilst Beyoncé stepping out in heeled Isabel Marants transformed women’s footwear fashions worldwide.

High Street fashion and shoe store Ash said they had added 30,000 extra pairs of its Bowie style to their normal order of 15,000 pairs this summer to meet demand.

Head of sales Claire O'Connor told the paper: 'This is definitely more than a passing fad, the Bowie has apealed to lots of age groups and women who might not normally wear trainers.'

Trainers are also known as as kicks, trabs daps, sandshoes, gym boots or joggers, gutties, or canvers, according to Wikipedia.

The first athletic shoes, with a canvas upper and rubber sole, were developed as beachwear in the 1830s by the Liverpool Rubber Company. They were  known then as plimsolls or pumps.

By the early 1900s, sneakers were being produced by small rubber companies who specialized in the production of bicycle tyres. U.S. Rubber, introduced Keds in 1916, about the same time that Converse was marketing its All Star.

At first, the market for sneakers was small and practically invisible, but after the First World War, the US turned to sports and athletes as a way to demonstrate moral fibre and patriotism.

A huge breakthrough came in when the Olympics were revived after the Second World War, attracting more fans not only to sports, but to sneakers as well.

The 1950s gave American families more leisure time, and as the baby boom started, more families chose to dress their youth in sneakers as school dress codes relaxed.

In the early 1960s, sneakers were imported to the US from Japan, but accounted for only a small portion of the market until Nike founders Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman began importing Onitsuka Tiger shoes (1950s) under the name Blue Ribbon Sports.

By the 1970s and 80s there were shoes for football, jogging, basketball, running - every sport had its own shoe and trainers had graduated to the movies.

Dustin Hoffman wore them while playing reporter Carl Bernstein in the 
movie All the President's Men while Cybill Shepherd even wore a pair of 
comfortable orange sneakers with her elegant black gown at the 1985 Emmy
Awards.

Woody Allen wore them to the ballet and Led Zeppelin had them on in their 1976 documentary.

Companies like Nike and Adidas cashed in on the craze with major endorsements to players - the largest  to Chicago basketball player Michael Jordan, who was given  a contract with Nike to make his own signature line of shoes and apparel.
