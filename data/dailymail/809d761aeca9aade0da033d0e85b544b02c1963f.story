A pair of teenagers who allegedly tried to rob two university students at gunpoint are behind bars after their would-be victims fought back putting their assailants in hospital.

When police arrived at the scene of the alleged robbery in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 27, they found Johnny Calderon Junior, 19, and Gerald Allen, 18, with beaten-up and bloodied faces.

They were being held in the custody of two University of Virginia Students after allegedly trying to rob them at the 2300 block of Fonaine Avenue.

Allegations: Johnny Calderon Junior (left) and Gerald Allen (right) are facing several charges including attempted robbery. The pair were hospitalized when their alleged victims fought back

According to NBC29.com, the pair were taken to hospital by ambulance for treatment, before being placed under arrest.

Calderon Junior is facing two charges of attempted robbery, one for pointing a firearm and 
one for using a firearm in a crime. He appeared in court on Friday.

Allen is facing two charges of attempted robbery. He is due to appear in court on October 3.

Both suspects were left with severe injuries. Allen was particularly badly beaten, and was unable to open one of his eyes for his police photo it was so badly swollen.

Their alleged victims, who have not been named, are said to have escaped the fracas without injury.

Charlottesville Police spokesman Ronnie Roberts said at this stage neither of the students will face charges because their actions were taken in self defence.

Police say they do not encourage victims to take matters into their own hands.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
