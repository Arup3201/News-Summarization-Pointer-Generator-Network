The fact that she had six kids has never stopped this 40-year-old Adelaidean mum from keeping fit and healthy.

Lucia Staykov has always been a fitness enthusiast and that didn't change when she fell pregnant to Jordy who is now 12.

When she found out she was going to have twins, she kept up her exercise routine up until she was 38 weeks pregnant, modifying her movements to keep her babies safe.

And when she was told she would have three baby girls in 2010 she was overjoyed but never did it cross her mind to kick back and stop her from instructing her beloved bootcamp or dance classes.

Is Lucia Staykov Australia's fittest mum? She managed to keep her trim body after having six children

'Exercise and fitness has always been a part of my life, I can't imagine giving it up and it didn't occur to me when I was pregnant with any of my kids,' Ms Staykov told Daily Mail Australia.

The bootcamp instructor and owner of XDrill Challenge, an outdoor bootcamp for groups said that the fact that the classes usually ran in the mornings made it easy for her to keep teaching after she had her kids due to the fact her husband could watch the babies while she taught.

Ms Staykov maintained healthy pregnancies for all six of her children and even taught a bootcamp class the morning before her son Jordy was born.

'I stopped dance and bootcamp at 38 weeks when I had the twins and stopped at 30 weeks when I had the triplets,' she said.

Fit family: The Staykov's love keeping active and eating wholesome foods just as their mum taught them

Ensuring her baby's health has always been her first priority but she felt that keeping up with her exercise routine was something that she could still do for herself.

'It was always modified exercises and I was always careful but it gave me energy so I loved it.'

'I found that I didn't get the discomforts most women get when pregnant because I was exercising,' Ms Staykov said, 'I didn't get the back pain or any leg cramps, so I would recommend it to other women.'

The question on everyone's lips to the fit mum was: How long did it take to regain your pre-pregnancy body?

Ms Staykov got her pre-pregnancy body back by maintaining her exercise routine throughout each pregnancy. She would modify exercises to keep the babies safe

'I feel like the weight dropped when the babies were out, but it took me 12 months of healthy eating and exercise to get back to where I was at and 18 months to where I felt completely happy with my body.'

Ms Staykov recommends easing back into exercise once you've been given clearance from your doctor, she kick started her exercise at six weeks after giving birth by going on light walks with her babies.

'Gradually incorporate some walking and abdominal exercises, don't push yourself too hard too early, but slowly build up your strength.'

And her abs? 'I'm sure they were under the babies still!' she laughed, ' Because I had that core strength before being pregnant I was able to regain them.'
