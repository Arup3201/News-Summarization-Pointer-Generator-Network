Virgin Atlantic has had to review its flight crew rosters after a pilot told official watchdogs that he and his co-pilot were ‘suffering symptoms of severe fatigue’.

However the Civil Aviation Authority had to apologise yesterday for initially giving an ‘incomplete’ account of the incident.

The CAA have now expressed ‘regret’ for suggesting that both the pilot and co-pilot had been asleep at the same time.

Virgin Atlantic admitted on Thursday that it was the carrier at the centre of the fatigue row

The captain and first officer were understood to have put the 325-seat plane on autopilot after reaching a cruising altitude of 30,000ft during a flight in August.

They then took it in turns to have 20-minute bouts of rest as the flight returned to Manchester from Orlando, Florida.

The CAA have expressed 'regret' for suggesting that both the pilot and co-pilot had been asleep at the same time

The captain and the co-pilot had only had five hours’ sleep in the previous 36 hours, they revealed in a safety report lodged with the CAA, Britain’s aviation regulator.

The CAA said yesterday: ‘The airline is now taking steps to adjust its rostering arrangements for flight crew.’

Virgin Atlantic admitted on Thursday that it was the carrier at the centre of the fatigue row.

But it denied categorically that both the pilot and co-pilot had been asleep ‘simultaneously’ on the packed long-haul flight.

In an embarrassing climbdown, the CAA has now issued a ‘clarification’ saying that while ‘both pilots were concerned they were suffering symptoms of severe fatigue and took controlled rest separately, they did not fall asleep at the same time’.

Virgin Atlantic said the two pilots concerned had flown in to New York and had been expecting a longer break.

They were ‘tired but able to fly’ and well within legal limits, according to a Virgin spokesman, who added: ‘We’re pleased the CAA has apologised and rectified its error.’
