Abandoning any claims to an insanity defense, a Vermont woman pleaded guilty Thursday to strangling to death a popular local science teacher in 2012.

At a mental competency hearing, a judge found Patricia Prue capable of rational decisions before she pleaded guilty to aggravated murder in the death of St. Johnsbury Academy teacher Melissa Jenkins.

Prue, 35, admitted she strangled the 32-year-old Jenkins, who prosecutors say was lured to her death with a ruse about a broken down car. 

Guilty: Patricia Prue, 35, pleaded guilty Thursday to aggravated murder in the 2012 strangulation death of St. Johnsbury Academy teacher Melissa Jenkins in Vermont 

Victim: Jenkins, 35, a science teacher and single mother of one, was beaten, strangled to death by the Prues and dumped in a river in March 2012 

Arriving in Caledonia Superior Court dressed in a grey sweatshirt and brown pants, with her once-long hair cropped short, Prue explained to the judge why she was accepting the plea deal.

‘Your honor, my answer to the question is that I would like to remain where I am, um, for the rest of my life,’ said Prue. ‘And that's why I'm doing it. Thank-you.’ 

She also said she wanted to plead guilty so that she could resume written contact with her husband Allen Prue, who is serving a life sentence for his role in the case. As co-defendants, the two weren't allowed to communicate while the charges were pending.

Prue's sudden decision to drop her insanity claims and change her plea to guilty took both the defense and the prosecution by surprise Thursday, as both sides had been busy preparing for a lengthy trial, according to Burlington Free Press.

‘It just happened so quickly today I'm still digesting it but I'm very pleased,’ said prosecutor Lisa Warren. ‘I know that it's been a long time for the family and the community awaiting this day so, I'm very happy with it.’ 

Mr Prue was found guilty in October of first-degree murder, conspiracy and attempted kidnapping in the death.

Blame game: Prue (left) pointed a finger of blame at his wife (right) and said during his sentencing that he was convicted for a crime he did not commit

At his sentencing in December, Prue, who had a snowplow business and had plowed Jenkins' driveway, blamed his wife for the crime.  

The 32-year-old convicted killer said he felt terrible for what happened but claimed he was convicted of a crime he didn't commit. 

'One thing I am guilty of is bringing this person who is responsible for this crime to Vermont,' he said tearfully.

But the judge rejected the defense arguments that Allen played a minor role in the crime. He said Prue and his wife were 'a pair hunting their prey.'

'The attack was committed with suddenness and ferocity,' he said. 'And Miss Jenkins was driven to the ground. The court does conclude that the attack was primarily driven by Mr. Prue, who has the strength ... and he was able to drive her to the ground and choke her out' although he may have not delivered the fatal choking.

Authorities say Allen Pruse told police he and his wife wanted 'to get a girl.'

Patricia Prue is to be sentenced Friday. She faces life in prison without parole. 

Prosecutors say the Prues planned the crime: Patricia Prue's computer had been used to conduct online searches for 'how to kidnap a girl,' the Prues got a stun gun and they bought a prepaid cellphone to call Jenkins to ask for help.

Orphaned: The single mother was reported missing after her vehicle was found that day idling on a rural road with her 2-year-old son inside

They say the Prues lured Jenkins from her home March 25, 2012, with the tale about car trouble, strangled and beat her and dumped her body in the Connecticut River. 

Before disposing of the body, the Prues removed all of Jenkins' clothes, poured bleach on the corpse and wrapped her in a tarp. 

The single mother was reported missing after her vehicle was found that day idling on a rural road with her 2-year-old son inside. Her body was found in the river the next day.

Police were led to the Prues after a Jenkins' friend told them Jenkins said she was suspicious after the Prues called her about their vehicle. They also found a business card for Allen Prue at Jenkins' home.
