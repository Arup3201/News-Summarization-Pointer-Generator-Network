Who's next on the Arsenal conveyor belt of world-class superstar heroes?

In the absence of major trophies, a forceful section of Gooners are taking it upon themselves to thrust forward a certain player as a world-class star who’s better than everyone else on the planet.

The tell-tale signs of this condition are as follows: Gooners go on social media to over-praise a certain player, selectively use statistics which support their point, and avoid at all costs a degree of measured judgement. The Arsenal player should be compared favourably with all others, especially if they play for Real Madrid, Barcelona or Chelsea.

The focus is on whoever’s playing well for Arsenal at the time, and the aim is to convince anyone gullible enough to take this nonsense seriously that Arsenal are still a serious force at the top level of the beautiful game.

At the start of last season it was Mesut Ozil. He cost £42million so he must be good, right? That all went a bit quiet when everyone quickly worked out the reasons why Real Madrid were happy to let him go. Without him they won the Champions League, with him Arsenal lifted the FA Cup. You do the maths.

Ozil was swiftly shifted into the shade and Aaron Ramsey was paraded as the new world-class star. It seemed like only a few weeks had passed since Arsenal fans were united in their desire for the Wales international to be moved on.

Yet Gooners would have us believe he was the best midfielder in Europe, the best Welshman on the planet - his FA Cup final goal was surely better than Gareth Bale’s Copa del Rey final effort, they claimed. No, not really.

This season it was Alexis Sanchez. Then he felt a bit tired, so Francis Coquelin was the next shiny  superstar. Just the kind of player Arsenal needed (probably why he was sent to Charlton until there was an injury crisis). 

Did I just hear someone compare him to Patrick Vieira? Next they’ll be claiming he’s better than Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic put together.

The over-hype of Coquelin embarrassed a few Gooners who understandably felt the need to inject some realism into the matter.

So now the spotlight is on Santi Cazorla. He’s the new Arsenal love-interest. Stats are being passed around showing he’s got more assists that Eden Hazard and David Silva. But how many managers would sign Cazorla over Hazard or Silva? I’d wager very few, although there’s no doubt he’s been playing well. So well that it’s been reported Atletico Madrid are keen to sign him.

So who will it be next? 

There was a brief flurry of love for Hector Bellerin after his goal against Aston Villa. And then his bang average performance in the defeat by Tottenham Hotspur calmed all that down. David Ospina’s clean sheet stat - until that pain at the Lane - had him promoted to David de Gea status among the Emirates faithful for a short time. 

Per Mertesacker won the 2014 World Cup so he must be world class, right? Unfortunately for the big German, his mate Lukas Podolski, and a whole host of footballers from World Cups past, it doesn’t work like that. Just look at Kleberson.

So what’s the big idea? What has made Arsenal fans come out with all this nonsense?

It’s this: they don’t win big trophies, so in order to try to keep themselves in the picture towards the top of the table, and keep up the image of a big club still up there with the big boys, they have to over-promote their players on a rotation basis beyond their true abilities.

If these players really are as good as Arsenal fans want us to believe, the Gunners would be top of the Premier League table and favourites to win the Champions League.

But they’re not.
