The biological father of the 3-year-old girl who a South Carolina court ruled last week should be returned to her adoptive parents has made it clear he isn’t giving up his daughter without a fight.

The state Supreme Court ruled last Wednesday to terminate Dusten Brown’s parental rights and return three-year-old Veronica to adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco who had looked after the girl from birth until 19 months ago when they were forced to hand her over to her biological father.

But Brown, who previously secured custody based on his Cherokee Nation  ancestry, now has several Native American special interest groups - the Native American Rights Fund, the National Congress of American Indians and the National Indian Child Welfare Association - working to fight the court’s decision.

South Carolina court officials are set to transfer custody of Veronica back to the Capobiancos within days and when they do these groups intend to file a federal lawsuit that they claim is on Veronica's behalf. 

‘We strongly believe that her federal civil rights are being violated,’ John Echohawk, a director for Native American Rights Fund, a law firm specializing in Indian rights, told Tulsa World.

Tribes across the country see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions.

In the middle of the increasingly 
complex custody battle, Brown has released a photograph of him together 
with his daughter taken on Monday before he had to leave for mandatory 
Oklahoma National Guard training.

Matt and Melanie Capobianco were in the delivery room when Veronica was born in Oklahoma in September 2009

'The decision contributes to the long and sordid history of Native American children being removed from their families without any consideration of their best interests,' said Jacqueline Pata, the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians.

Brown also has gone before a Cherokee Nation court to have other family members declared joint guardians of Veronica, including his wife, Robin Brown, and his parents, Tommy and Alice Brown.

Last Wednesday the state Supreme Court ruled in a 3:2 decision that the Capobiancos are the only party properly seeking to adopt Veronica in South Carolina and ordered a Family Court to finalize the couple's adoption.

'We are thrilled that after 18 long months, our daughter finally will be coming home,' the couple said in a statement at the time.

'We look forward to seeing Veronica's
smiling face in the coming days and will do everything in our power to 
make her homecoming as smooth as possible.

'We also want to thank everyone who has supported us throughout this ordeal. Our prayers have been answered.'

South
Carolina courts originally said the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act — a 
federal law intended to keep Indian children from being taken from their
homes and typically placed with non-Indian adoptive or foster parents —
favored her living with her biological father.

A
member of the Cherokee Nation, Brown had never met his daughter and, 
after the girl's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, 
played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the 
girl was born.

But 
when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted, he objected and 
said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning 
tribal traditions.

Brown took custody in 2011 and has been living with his daughter in Oklahoma since then.

But
the Capobiancos — who were present at the girl's birth and even cut her
umbilical cord raised Veronica for the first 27 months of her life — 
appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Last
month, the nation's high court ruled that South Carolina courts should 
decide who gets to adopt the girl, a determination the state court made 
yesterday.

'We think the 
Supreme Court plainly contemplated an expeditious resolution of this 
case, and we believe the facts of this case require it,' the South 
Carolina high court wrote, ordering a Family Court to finalize the 
Capobiancos' adoption and to terminate Brown's parental rights.

'There is absolutely no need to compound any suffering that Baby Girl may experience through continued litigation.'

Earlier this month, Brown filed a petition to adopt the child in Oklahoma.

'As
you can imagine, we are shocked and saddened at this development,' John
S. Nichols, a South Carolina-based attorney for Brown, wrote in an 
email.

'There is no 
mention, or apparent consideration, in the majority decision of the 
child's best interest, as the dissenters point out.'

Separately,
Justices Costa Pleicones and Don Beatty wrote that, while the case's 
details should be hammered out in Family Court, the transfer of the girl
should be handled delicately so as to be least disruptive to her.

'The
majority orders the immediate transfer of the child, no longer an 
infant or toddler, upon the filing of the family court's adoption order,
without regard to whether such an abrupt transfer would be in the 
child's best interest,' the two justices wrote.

'This
is a situation where the decisions that are in the best interests of 
this child, given all that has happened in her short life, must be 
sorted out in the lower court(s).'
