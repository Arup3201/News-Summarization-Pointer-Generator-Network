What better way to prepare for a UFC title defence than sparring with a boxing legend?

Well UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones has done just that, posting a video on Instagram with former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson.

Luckily for Jones the quick box wasn’t in the ring as Tyson, an avid mixed martial arts fan, still showed he’s still pretty good with his hands.

‘Bones’ caught on camera and posted on his Instagram account with the caption ‘Quick sparring session with @MikeTyson #boxing #mma #Goodtimes’.

Jones, 23, became the youngest champion in UFC history in 2011 and recently underwent surgery to repair his knee, which forced a planned title defence against Daniel Cormier back to January 2015.

During his rehab Jones has also been seen dabbling in the world of WWE wrestling but will look to prepare in time for his much anticipated seventh title defence against Cormier. The pair brawled in Las Vegas at the beginning of the month and will certainly be a bout to watch out for in January.
