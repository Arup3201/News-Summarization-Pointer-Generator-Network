He may only have spent a season and a half in Istanbul, but Didier Drogba showed he still has a soft spot for Galatasaray.

The Chelsea striker took time out to pay a visit to his former team-mates at their training base in Turkey.

Galatasaray shared a selection of images on Instagram of the 37-year-old forward, who was sporting a camouflage jacket, on his visit to the club.

Drogba scored 20 goals in 53 matches for Galatasaray during his spell there and helped them to the Turkish league title in 2013.

The Ivorian then rejoined Chelsea in the summer of 2014 having left the club two years earlier following their Champions League success.

Drogba also took time out last October to meet his former team-mates when Galatasaray travelled to London for a Champions League tie against Arsenal at the Emirates.

The 37-year-old has scored six times for Jose Mourinho's side this season in all competitions.
