A three-month-old baby has died a month after he was found covered in vomit and living in a filthy, cockroach-infested home with his seven older siblings.

Donald Hemmings III passed away on January 20, exactly a month after his father, Donald Hemmings Jr., 42, and Geneva Morgan, 39, were arrested by North Las Vegas police for neglect.

Baby Donald and seven other children, aged nine months, one, three, seven, 11, 13 and 17, were discovered inside the home while officers served a search warrant during a robbery investigation.

The baby, who was placed in another home, died in hospital after he was found unresponsive in a home this month, but his cause of death is not yet known, the Review-Journal reported.

Officers from North Las Vegas Police discovered the baby and his seven siblings living in a filthy apartment as they investigated a robbery last month. The three-month-old has now passed away, authorities said

Family Services wrote in a January 23 report that 'no abuse or neglect is suspected with the death'. 

The North Las Vegas Police were unable to comment on whether the boy's death was accidental, natural or the result of criminal action, and said an investigation is underway.

The youngster was found living in conditions North Las Vegas Police called 'an extreme environmental hazard' in a December 20, 2014 report.

When officers entered the apartment, they found cockroaches crawling on the floor, walls and ceiling, and even across the children as they shared one bed. Some of the children in the home were Hemmings' and others were Morgan's.

The rooms were littered with dirty linen and garbage stacked several feet high, according to the report. There was also a broken toilet inside the home filled with human waste, police said.

The baby was found sleeping inside the home with vomit on his face, the report said. 

As many as 12 people lived in the home, but there were only a few boxes of food and loose deli meat in the freezer, according to the Review-Journal.

When Child Protective Services stepped in, it emerged that Morgan had at least 12 prior abuse and neglect investigations against her.

Cases from 2008, 2010 and 2014 stemmed from filthy living conditions, infant drug exposure and for the children missing school. She was also accused of child neglect in 1997. 

Hemmings had prior arrests stemming from marijuana and traffic offenses.

In this case, Morgan and Hemmings were each charged with eight counts of felony child abuse and neglect.
