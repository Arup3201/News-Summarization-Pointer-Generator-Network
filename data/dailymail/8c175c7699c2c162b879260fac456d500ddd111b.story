A police search of the southwest Missouri home of a middle-school football coach accused in a 10-year-old girl's kidnapping and death found child pornography and more than a dozen guns, according to search warrants released Friday.

Officers retrieved a three-ring binder containing pornographic photos of young children at the home of Craig Michael Wood, the documents released by Springfield police say.

Investigators also seized computers, cameras, 30 video recordings, handwritten journals, a spent .22 caliber shell casing and a hat believed to have been worn by fourth-grader Hailey Owens.

Wood is accused of snatching Hailey as 
she walked home from her best friend's house this week, just two blocks 
from her own home. Neighbors said they watched in horror and 
unsuccessfully gave chase as Hailey was pulled into a pickup truck that 
sped away.

At a brief hearing Friday, Wood's lawyer said he plans to plead not guilty.

Wood appeared via video from the Greene County Jail, where he is being held without bond. He spoke only briefly to answer several questions from the judge. Hailey's parents, older brother and five other family members also attended.

Court records released earlier as well as the search warrants indicate her body was found in Wood's basement, stuffed into trash bags and plastic containers. Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson said Hailey was shot in the back of the head and had ligature marks on her wrists, suggesting she was tied up.

Disbelief: Prosecutors have charged Craig Michael Wood with first-degree murder, kidnapping and armed criminal action in Stacey Barfield's (foreground left) daughter Hailey's death

A preliminary autopsy is complete but 
won't be released publicly because the criminal case remains open, 
according to the county medical examiner's office.

Patterson said he is considering whether to seek the death penalty.

At
 the arraignment, public defender Chris Hatley said Wood plans to 
contest the charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and armed 
criminal action.

Assistant 
prosecutor Todd Myers challenged Wood's use of a public defender after 
he said police found evidence of a $1 million trust in Wood's name. The 
source of that income is not clear: Both Wood's father and an attorney 
representing the suspect's parents did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment on Friday.

'I think he can afford his own attorney,' Myers said.

Hatley replied that he appreciated the prosecutor's concern for Wood's rights but that "it's frankly none of his business."

Circuit
 Judge Dan Imhof said he would consider the matter. He scheduled a 
follow-up court appearance in March and a preliminary hearing in April.

Charged: Craig Michael Wood, 45, worked as a middle school coach before he allegedly kidnapped and murdered 10-year-old Hailey Owens

Wood
 was a 16-year football coach at a middle school in Springfield, about 
160 miles southeast of Kansas City. He also worked as a substitute 
teacher and teacher's aide overseeing suspensions.

Police
 said they found Wood holding duct tape as he left his father's pickup 
truck parked outside his home Tuesday night, just hours after Hailey 
went missing. Court records indicate the floor of the basement where the
 girl's body was found was still damp with bleach â€” presumably used to 
clean the crime scene.

Wood 
had little criminal history, according to online court records. He 
pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance in 1990 in Greene
 County and was fined $100.

Wood also was convicted in 2001 for illegal 
taking of wildlife, a misdemeanor. Friends said Wood is an amateur 
bluegrass musician and hunter who never married or had children and 
whose parents raised show horses.

Those
 who knew Hailey recalled a child who loved to laugh, smile and dance. 
Thousands are expected to attend a candlelight vigil in her honor 
Saturday night.
