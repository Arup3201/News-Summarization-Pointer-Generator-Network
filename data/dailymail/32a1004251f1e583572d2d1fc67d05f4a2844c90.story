Police in Russia are searching for a motorist who was filmed driving a baby around in a car without doors.

Shocking images of the driver emerged after motorist Anton Rabahov, 32, and pal Aleksey Mihovich, 30, filmed him in the city of Omsk, in south-western Siberia.

‘I was aware that a car was overtaking me, and I just looked sideways to glance at the vehicle and was amazed when I could see straight though it because there were no doors at all on the left hand side,’ said Anton.

Shocking: A driver was filmed in Russia in a car with no doors - and a baby in the back seat

Investigation: The images are now being studied by police, who say that the driver may be guilty of endangering a life

The images - now being studied by police - clearly show the shorts-wearing driver with a baby strapped into a child seat behind him.

YouTube video of the footage has provoked a huge campaign on social media to find the driver.

Anton Bondarenko, head of the city's department for road safety said: ‘I understand the public outrage and I’m shocked that a child is in such a car.’

Police say the motorist, if they can identify him, could face charges of endangering a life.

‘His car clearly isn't in a fit state to be on the road, but the worst of it is that the child would be completely vulnerable in an accident,’ said a police spokesman.
