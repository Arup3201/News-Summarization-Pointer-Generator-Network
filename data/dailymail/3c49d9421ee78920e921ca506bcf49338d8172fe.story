A footballer and two Far Eastern businessmen have been jailed for plotting to fix the results of lower league football matches.

Footballer Michael Boateng, 22, was found guilty along with businessmen Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan, of conspiracy to commit bribery following a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Singaporean Sankaran, 34, and Sri-Lankan-born Ganeshan, 44, labelled in court as ‘the controlling minds’ behind efforts to influence the outcome of matches in League Two and the Conference South, were each jailed for five years.

Boateng, a former defender with Conference South club Whitehawk FC, was sentenced to 16 months in prison for his role in the plot.

Sentencing the trio, Judge Melbourne Inman QC said: ‘Professional football and sport play an important part in national life and individuals’ lives in this country.

‘Those who make determined attempts to destroy its integrity for personal gain must expect significant prison sentences so when such acts are discovered a clear signal is sent to others.’

The judge told Sankaran he would be ‘liable to deportation’ back to his home country once he had served his sentence, but it would be a matter for the Home Secretary.

He told the co-conspirators their scheme was laid bare by surveillance and covertly recorded conversations following an investigation by the the National Crime Agency (NCA).

To Ganeshan, of Hastings, East Sussex, and Sankaran, of Singapore, he said: ‘I am satisfied you were at the head of this conspiracy, you two were the controlling minds.

‘The two of you came to this country in November last year, for the sole reason of visiting clubs to find players you could corrupt to fix matches.’

The co-conspirators were found guilty of trying to throw the results of football matches, including the game between AFC Wimbledon and Dagenham & Redbridge on November 26 last year, in order to make money

Far Eastern businessmen Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan were caught by the undercover investigation attempting to change a large amount of euros into sterling at various money bureaux outlets

He said they had purposefully targeted lower division football clubs because the cost of bribing the players ‘on their modest wages’ was cheaper than approaching players from the higher leagues.

‘This was an, if not sophisticated, then well-planned and determined conspiracy motivated by the expectation of significant gain,’ the judge said.

He also said it was ‘sad to see’ Boateng, who it was heard had been a valued church and charity group youth worker in London, appearing in court.

His barrister, Denis Barry, told the judge how children in the south London community where he volunteered felt ‘very badly let down’ by a man they had seen as a role model.

‘He has lost his good name in the community,’ he said.

The judge told Boateng, from Croydon, London: ‘You allowed yourself to quickly be drawn in to this scheme’, and said he was ‘perfectly willing to corrupt other footballers’ as part of the conspiracy.

The co-conspirators had denied trying to throw the results of football matches, including the game between AFC Wimbledon and Dagenham & Redbridge on November 26 last year, in order to make money from bets placed on the outcomes.

When Ganeshan and Sankaran arrived in the UK earlier that month, they immediately set about building what the NCA described as ‘a network of corrupt players in the UK’, the court heard.

There is no evidence that the outcome of match was ever thrown.

But, in a conversation recorded in November last year, Ganeshan was heard telling a contact in Singapore: ‘I want to start making money, my pocket is empty.’

He later told the same contact he was expecting to make sums of “75,000 to 100,000’, of which the judge said ‘whether euros, US dollars or pounds, it’s a significant amount of money’.

Meanwhile, Sankaran had what the judge called a ‘bogus contract’ relating to a Finnish club, and pretended he was an agent in a bid to get footballers to contact him.

Ganeshan had also set up a company called Matchworld Sports Ltd with an address in London’s prestigious Mayfair, for which business cards were printed, but that had never traded and never paid its rent.

Judge Inman said: ‘Your only interest was luring footballers in advancing your plan.’

The court heard how the men were snared ‘by their own mouths’ after the NCA bugged their hotel rooms, listening in on their conversations.

It also sent in an undercover agent posing as the scheme’s UK investor who handed the businessmen 60,000 euros (£47,000), which they then spent on bribes and placing bets.

The two men later handed 450 euros (£358) to Boateng, who was then playing for Brighton-based Whitehawk FC.

The judge said the case showed that all professional clubs, including non-league sides, needed to be ‘extremely vigilant’ that the ‘poison’ of match-fixing corruption did not affect them.

NCA branch commander Richard Warner said: ‘This is not sport as a football-loving nation recognises it.

‘It is corruption and bribery linked to serious organised crime, and the NCA is determined to stop criminals benefiting from it.

‘The evidence in corruption cases is 
often either verbal or visual. Unless you are there when money changes 
hands, or plans are made, that evidence is gone.

‘We
 had a vital opportunity here to intervene early, secure the evidence to
 get convictions, and put a stop to Sankaran’s and Ganeshan’s much wider
 and more sinister ambitions.’

The NCA said it was working with the Gambling Commission and the Football Association and its investigation continues.

A fourth man, Hakeem Adelakun, 23, of south London, was acquitted by the jury of any involvement in the conspiracy.

Jurors were discharged from reaching a verdict on a fifth man, ex-Whitehawk footballer Moses Swaibu, after deliberating for more than 15 hours.

Swaibu, 25, of Bermondsey, south London, denies a single count of conspiracy and was granted unconditional bail pending a retrial.
