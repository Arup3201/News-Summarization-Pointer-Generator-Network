The number of students taking foreign languages at university is in free fall (file picture)

The number of students taking foreign languages at university is in free fall, with enrolment for French courses down by a quarter.

Entrants for modern language degrees fell by 16 per cent from 2007 to last year, the Higher Education Statistics Agency reveals.

Those studying German dropped by 34 per cent with only 615 enrolling on courses last year.

Only 1,775 started a French degree course in 2013/14 and Italian student entries fell by 19 per cent.

The Confederation of British Industry has previously warned that this lack of linguistic ability is acting as a 'tax on UK trade'. Part of the problem is fewer universities are offering language courses because they cost more to run than other subjects.

Last summer's GCSE results showed that Spanish was the only one of three traditional languages to see a rise in entries, a move that some put down to the 'Messi impact' of high-profile Spanish-speaking personalities like Argentinian football star Lionel Messi fuelling youngsters interest in the subject. 

Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: 'The unfortunate reality is that language learning at university level is in decline with little to suggest that this is set to change any time soon.

'These latest figures are another blow for language lovers in the UK. It is particularly disappointing to see that even Spanish, a language that has generally bucked the trend in declining language take up at GCSE and A-level, has also seen an overall drop albeit at a less dramatic rate than French and German. 

'If we are to compete in a global economy, we need more of our young people to be able to understand and embrace other languages in order to live and work in a globalised society, as well as to become the language teachers of the future. An international outlook has never been more important for the UK's place in the world - this starts with language learning.'

Meanwhile the number of students applying for maths, business and biology degrees has grown, the statistics showed.
