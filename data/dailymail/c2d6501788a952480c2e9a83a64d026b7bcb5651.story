Washing your mouth out with soap is normally a punishment.

Looking at these enticing glycerin sculptures, however, you might be tempted to try it.

The impressive creations by Aubrey Stephens, from Connecticut, US, come in the shape of sushi, bacon and eggs, cereal and toast.

Something fishy's going on here: Artistic Aubrey Stephens has recreated every detail of sushi in this soap, down to each tiny grain of rice

Cool things and hot stuff: If you know which side your bread is buttered, you won't try to eat these mouthwatering lollies or this tasty slice of toast

Just eggs-cellent: A morning shower is not complete without this detailed soapy replica of a fried breakfast

For those with a sweeter tooth, the tempting treats also come in the guise of all kinds of confectionery, from ice lollies and biscuits to iced buns and gummy bears.

The 31-year-old has even made a soap that looks so much like a frosty pint you may want to drink it - as long as you like your beer fragranced with flowers.

'A few holidays ago I was scrounging around for something to make my mother,' said Ms Stephens.

'I had decided I wanted to create perfume and after researching that stumbled into the art of soap-making.

'The first thing I ever made was little blocks of soap for autumn - I was handing it out to anyone I ran into.

Beer at bathtime: A chilled pint is just the thing to make you feel refreshed and relaxed

Sweetest thing: It would be pretty tough not to devour these scented cinnamon buns

'I couldn't stop dreaming up new soaps and trying to make things as realistic as possible.'

Ms Stephens  takes inspiration from bakeries, 
confectionery and well-known meals and snacks.

She melts glycerin soap, adds 
colouring dyes and fragrances, and then moulds into shape before adding the finishing touches to her unique designs.

'Then I package it up as lovely as possible, design tags for each and ship it off,' she added.

Gummy soaps: But these glycerin neon sweets might not be as chewy as their sugary counterparts

'I'm a total foodie and adore finding 
family-run bakeries with little confectionery jewels, I love fragrances 
as well, so this creative endeavour matched up all my loves.

'People often find the soap realistic so
now I always want people to absolutely know it's soap and not edible, I
make sure to label everything as clearly as possible.

'I have heard a few hilarious stories 
about people getting very close to trying to eat some of my creations, 
before getting stopped and having the jokester explain what it really 
is.'
