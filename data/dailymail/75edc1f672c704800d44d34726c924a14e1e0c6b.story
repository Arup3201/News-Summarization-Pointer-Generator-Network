A good pair of SPANX is every woman's secret weapon to looking slim and slinky under a tight outfit.

But even when it's time to bare all on the beach, the shapewear brand's got British women covered with their swimwear line infused with signature technology.

The 2014 range comes in a range of jewel tones and flattering cuts, all encompassing that SPANX 'magic' in the lining.

Riveting Ruched One Piece, £117, featuring 'supportive and firming' fabric

Dubbed SPANX Swim, the range has been flying off shelves in America since summer 2010 but now the brand are promoting it on British shores with their stylish 2014 range.

The somewhat retro-style collection is inspired by 1950s and 60s glamour and Maylin-esque, nipped-in curves.

Pieces feature sleek Spandex and nylon shell on the outside and the power of SPANX shapewear on the inside. Women can shop by dress and cup size for the perfect fit.

Standout pieces include the signature black Riveting Ruched One Piece, £117, (pictured above) which features 'supportive and firming' fabric, moulded, underwired cups for ample bust support and feminine shirring to visually slim.

Whittle Waistline Draped Tankini Top, £81. Inside, the power of SPANX shapewear; outside, Spandex shell (l) and Belted Beauty Halter Tankini Top, £81, inspired by retro 1960s glam, accentuates the waistline (r)

All pieces in the range have flattering V necklines apart from the Braided Core One Piece and tankini which both feature an adjustable halter strap weaving into a plaited centre.

The boho inspired fabric straps converge into a centre braid concealing lumps and bumps.

Cleverly placed 'hardware' buckles on many styles are placed on the waistline or by the collarbone to emphasise slim and feminine areas of the body.

Braided Core One Piece, £123, features chic bohemian braiding, shaping your figure to perfection

A
 spokesperson explains why British women should go for SPANX Slim: 'For all of
 you who wrote us and said you were tempted to wear your Spanx to the 
beach… we just couldn't bear the thought of your tan lines! So, we put 
the magic of Spanx inside the swimsuit.

'We
 know how to make a woman look and feel her best and are using that 
knowledge so you can forget the dreaded experience of trying on your 
swimsuit in the dark, drink in hand. Now you can confidently suit up.'
