Rafael Nadal negotiated a tricky test against Kevin Anderson to reach his 28th Grand Slam quarter-final at the Australian Open on Sunday.

World No 3 Nadal came through a tight first set before easing to a 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 victory against South African Anderson which seals a last-eight clash with Tomas Berdych.

Nadal said: 'I am very happy with the way I played today. Probably the best match of the year so that is very important for me.

'For me [the] quarter-finals is a great result. Arriving here after losing in the first round of Qatar, not playing matches for the last seven months, to be in the quarter-finals again here is a very positive thing for me.'

Anderson will rue several missed chances in the first set when he failed to convert any of five break points at 5-5 and then missed a volley in the next game to go one set down.

Nadal then took charge, dropping just one game in the second set and one break was enough in the third for the Spaniard to claim victory in two hours and six minutes.

The 28-year-old now goes on to face seventh seed Berdych after the Czech continued his serene progress through the draw with a 6-2, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 win against Aussie Bernard Tomic.

Nadal may be favourite given that he has beaten Berdych in all of their last 17 meetings, but the latter looks to be in fine form with Andy Murray's ex-coach Dani Vallverdu now by his side.

Nadal said: 'It doesn't matter what happened in the past. It is a different story this time. Different moment for me, different moment for him.

'I have success against him, but I have the chances to lose against him. I remember in 2012 I had a very, very tough match against him here. I was close to being two sets to love down.'
