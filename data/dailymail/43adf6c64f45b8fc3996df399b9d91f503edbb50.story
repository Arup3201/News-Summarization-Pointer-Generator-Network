Manchester United’s Ander Herrera could be dragged into the on-going match-fixing investigation of the Spanish first division match between Levante and Zaragoza in the 2010-11 season.

Reports in Spanish media on Tuesday suggest that Herrera, who was playing for Zaragoza at the time, is one of eight players who was paid a sum of money into his bank account by then Zaragoza president Iglesias Agapito, which he was then requested to return to his president in cash.

The anti-corruption enquiry is investigating the possibility that Agapito used the money to pay off Zaragoza’s rivals Levante on the last day of the season in a game his team needed to win in order to stay up.

There is no suggestion that Hererra and his team-mates knew what the money was for, or were knowingly involved in any wrongdoing, and then club captain Gabi, who is understood to have received two bank transfers, totaling 90,000 euros, is already understood to have told the investigation ‘I was doing what the club told me.’

According to reports, the investigation has found that the eight players, and then coach and current Japan manager Javier Aguirre, received the money in the week leading up to the match and returned it in cash to Agapito.

The since-departed Zaragoza president has claimed the payments into his players’ accounts were a bonus but the players have vehemently denied this.

If the case is accepted to court then Herrera could be called to give evidence in Spain or he could request special dispensation to do so in England.

Former Zaragoza captain Gabi, now at Atletico Madrid,  has said ‘I was doing what the club told me.’

Former Zaragoza coach and current Japan manager Javier Aguirre is also said to have received money
