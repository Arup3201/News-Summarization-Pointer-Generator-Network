A lesbian couple claiming £22,000 a year in benefits want a new house from the council for their four children, saying they are too stressed to work.

Civil partners Lisa and Carrie-Ann Beaney say homophobic bullying from neighbours has left them unable to hold down a job.

Carrie-Ann, 23, has never worked and Lisa, 30, quit her McDonald’s job after three months because it made her too anxious.

It meant when the government’s benefit cap was introduced their housing payments were slashed and the pair were evicted from their rented home.

Carrie-Ann Beaney, left, with daughter Calise, 14 months, and Lisa, right, with son Tommy, 16 months. The couple say they have received homophobic abuse saying they didn't deserve to have children

Since then they have been living in a single B&B room at a cost of £608 a week to the taxpayer.

On top of their £21,900-a-year income from child and income support, that totals an equivalent cost to taxpayers of £53,000 a year.

The couple argue they would be able to work if they weren’t bullied about their sexuality - and afford a house themselves.

Lisa said: 'It does feel like we were
persecuted against because of our sexuality and I think the council 
needs to show us some sympathy.

'They
guaranteed us that they would be able to find us a house as soon as we 
were out of the private house, but we are still here.

'The
best they’ve come up with is privately rented property but we wouldn’t 
be able to afford it and the same thing would happen again.

'We
got loads of abuse in the streets and one time we got a letter through 
the door saying we were disgusting and didn’t deserve to have children.

'It just means the only time we are ever close is at home. We don’t hold hands when we are out together or anything.

'We
did have the police around a few times because our car was damaged and 
our fence was damaged and then one day I was assaulted.

'When Dillon went to school he would have kids throw abuse at him and punch him because we were lesbians.

'It’s disgusting that grown adults can behave like that.'

But former neighbours accused of abusing them said they didn’t even know the couple were lesbians.

The couple have reportedly posted Youtube clips of them happily dancing in the home where they claim they were made miserable by abuse.

Former neighbour Sheila Eagle, 69, retired, said: 'We didn’t even know they were lesbians for a long time.

'I don’t even think any of the neighbours knew them. I do not believe for a single second they received homophobic abuse.'

She added: 'The landlords came round here asking about the family because they hadn’t been paying rent or bills.

'But we saw them with cars full of stuff from Argos where they had been buying new things though.

'They wanted to be given a council house and this was a way of getting it, if you ask me.'

The couple from Ashford, Kent, describe themselves as bisexual and became legal partners in December 2010.

Lisa already had son Devon, seven, and Carrie-Ann had son Dillon, eight, from their previous heterosexual relationships.

They persuaded a male friend to donate the sperm they needed for artificial insemination at home, and fell pregnant at the same time.

Last year Lisa gave birth to Tommy, now 16 months, and partner Carrie-Ann had daughter Calise, now 14 months.

But when the benefit cap was introduced in April, the family were unable to afford the £850-a-month rent on their three-bedroom house.

The family currently claim £141-a-week in Employment Support Allowance as a result of Lisa’s depression.

They also receive £60-a-week in child benefit for their four children with an additional £11,437-a-year in child tax credits.

It means the couple have a joint income of £21,900-a-year.

With
the £608-per-week B&B rates the government is covering the family 
receive the equivalent of £53,000-a-year - although this will 
drop if they are given a housing association property.

They would be exempt from the cap if they worked - but they say they receive too much harassment about their sexuality.

Ashford Borough Council said the couple and their children have been offered a three bedroom-home which they are viewing tomorrow.

A spokesman said: 'We did offer the family a property through our social lettings agency but they declined the offer, again on affordability.

'However, they have now successfully bid through Choice-Based Lettings for a three-bedroomed property.

'We also have one of the 70 private sector leased properties become available and these are available as a longer-term option.

'This could be a solution should the property they are viewing tomorrow be unsuitable.'

They added: 'Throughout the process Miss Beaney and her family have been treated as would any other family.

'Following an initial assessment the council accepted a homeless duty to the family.'
