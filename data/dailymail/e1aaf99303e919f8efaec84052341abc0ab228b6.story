Captured: U.S. officials have confirmed the capture of Anas al-Libi, his family said he was captured from in front of his home by armed commandos

Though they seeked to achieve two very similar objectives - the killing or capture of high-ranking terrorists, the different approaches taken in the two Saturday raids illustrate the versatility of Special Operations commandos.

The Somali operation, a raid on a highly-fortified terrorist bunker on the coast south of Mogadishu, used water and darkness to its advantage – but the Tripoli, Libya raid took advantage of the natural barriers provided by cornering the target in his gated community while parking a car.

The Libyan target, senior al-Qaeda member Anas al-Libi, was quickly captured without a single shot being fired. Officials are unsure if the Somali target, a high-ranking al-Shabaab member, was killed in a fierce firefight that ended when Navy SEALS retreated.

Accused of plotting the coordinated twin 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed over 200 and injured well over 1,000 people, Anas al-Libi, 49, was captured rather simply, according to family members.

The wanted man was parking his car outside his family’s home in a gated community in Tripoli after morning prayers when three cars filled with armed commandos encircled him, said his sister-in-law.

They jumped out, smashed his window and took his weapon within seconds. Anas al-Libi was then extracted from the car and taken with the Special Forces soldiers as they fled the neighborhood, she explained.

First said to be armed foreign commandos by the frightened woman, US officials later confirmed Anas al-Libi’s capture. The Libyan government was aware of the raid in advance.

No special vehicles were used in the capture, a stark contrast to the Somali raid.

Coming ashore in boats under cloak of darkness, Navy SEALS quietly advanced up the beach towards a home in Baraawe, about 150 miles south of the Somali capital city Mogadishu.

The beachfront home is known to house high-level terrorists and was notably the most-recent known address of Ahmed Abdi Godane, an al-Shabaab leader who claimed responsibility for last month’s Westgate Mall terror attack in Nairobi, Kenya.

Using silencers, the SEALS opened fire on the beach house exactly two weeks to the day the Westgate Mall siege began.

It is not clear how many SEALS were involved in the dramatic raid, but they were soon engaged by the terrorists in a loud firefight that startled neighbors and forced the withdrawal of the American commandos.

Witnesses said 12 al-Shabaab militants were in the home at the time of the attack, likely staying before deploying to a mission abroad. Somali government officials said one person died in the attack, local police claimed seven men were killed, according to Reuters.

'We were awoken by heavy gunfire last night, we thought an al Shabaab base at the beach was captured,' Sumira Nur, a mother of four, told Reuters. Mr Nur also heard shells, but was not sure where they landed, she said.

Aware of the assault in advance, a Somalian government official said several ‘high-profile’ foreigners were targets of the SEALS.

One enemy combatant died, a spokesperson for the terror group said. There were no American casualties, according to US officials.

'Westerners in boats attacked our base at Baraawe beach and one was martyred from our side,” an al-Shabaab spokesman told Reuters. 'No planes or helicopters took part in the fight. The attackers left weapons, medicine and stains of blood, we chased them.'

US officials have been unable to confirm the death or the identity of the wanted terrorist.

The Westgate Mall siege lasted three days and resulted in the deaths of 69 people.
