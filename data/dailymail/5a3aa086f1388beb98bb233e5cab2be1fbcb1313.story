Honoured: Alan Parker, a City public relations chief who has holidayed with the Prime Minister, was handed a knighthood

David Cameron was accused of 'cronyism' last night after handing gongs to friends, Tory donors and even the woman who runs his supper club.

Alan Parker, a City public relations chief who has holidayed with the Prime Minister, was handed a knighthood in the new year's honours list.

And at least two Tory donors and four people who have given money to the Liberal Democrats will get gongs – a move critics said 'discredits the honours system'. Peter Emerson Jones, who has given £41,000 to the Tories, including £31,000 to George Osborne's constituency party, wins an OBE.

The Cheshire property magnate, who has
 made seven donations to the Tatton Tories since 2008 – the most recent 
being £5,000 on August 12 – was rewarded for services to business in the
 North West.

Mr Cameron has 
been accused of running a Government of cronies and friends that is out 
of touch with the concerns of ordinary Britons.

He
 secured an MBE for Marion Dowding, the former deputy chairman of his 
West Oxfordshire Conservative Association, for voluntary political 
service. She is currently chairman of West Oxfordshire Conservative 
Association's supper club.

Trevor
 Mort, another Oxfordshire Tory and chairman of the Conservative Party 
disciplinary committee picks up an OBE. Carole Hyde, former chairman of 
the same committee, wins an MBE, also for voluntary political service.

Liberal
 Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott told the Mail: 'Honours should go to 
unsung heroes or heroines, not Cameron's cronies and Osborne's donors.

'It's low-level corruption compared with peddling peerages, but it still stinks.'

The
 decision to give a knighthood to Mr Parker, boss of the Brunswick PR 
company, raised eyebrows since he has sought to cultivate close 
relationships with politicians of all parties.

The son of former British Rail chief Sir Peter Parker, the PR man once employed Gordon Brown's wife Sarah and Mr Brown is godfather to his son William.

Karren Brady has been handed a CBE just two months after introducing George Osborne at the Tory Party conference.

The Conservatives are trying to persuade the Apprentice star, left, to become an MP or their candidate for mayor of London when Boris Johnson stands down in 2016.

Miss Brady, who spoke at the Tory conference on the subject of small enterprises, has been appointed by David Cameron as a business ambassador. She is also vice-chairman of West Ham United FC.

But as the Tories returned to political ascendancy he started to cultivate Mr Cameron too.

The
 pair holidayed together in South Africa in 2008 where they watched 
whales at Plettenberg Bay and were photographed together splashing in 
the surf.

No stranger to controversy, Mr Parker advised U.S. food giant Kraft in its £12billion hostile takeover of the British firm Cadbury.

Kevin Barron, MP for Rother Valley, was handed an honour

Three MPs won knighthoods – Tories Peter Luff and Richard Ottaway and Labour's Kevin Barron. Other political donors with awards include Lady Patricia Hobson, who receives an OBE for services to ballet and philanthropy.

She has made four donations to the Hendon Tory Party totalling £20,000.

Four Lib Dem donors receive gongs. Robert Brown, who was awarded a CBE for political service, has made four donations of between £1,125 and £1,560 to the Scottish Lib Dems. Robert Woodthorpe-Browne, of Liberal International, wins an MBE for political service.

He has handed £2,400 to West Worcestershire Lib Dems.

Lord Oakeshott said: 'Honours should go to unsung heroes or heroines, not Cameron's cronies and Osborne's donors'

David Holmes, former chief executive of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, is handed a CBE for services to children and families. He handed £6,000 to Horsham Liberal Democrats in 2011.

And Peter Bennett Jones, who was given a CBE for services to the entertainment industry and charity, particularly through Comic Relief, has given Nick Clegg's party £37,500.

Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the Civil Service who chairs the honours committee, said: 'Nobody gets an honour because of their donation. It is entirely irrelevant.' A Tory spokesman said the process was 'transparent and robust'.
