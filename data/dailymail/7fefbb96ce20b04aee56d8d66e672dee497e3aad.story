Maverick Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino caused consternation when he was spotted watching his side's away clash with Brentford with the home fans. 

He was soon escorted to the away end and watched the rest of the match with the Leeds fans, where he saw Jota give the Bees the lead on the stroke of half-time.

Alan McCormack made it 2-0 to the hosts late in the second half.  

Bemused and excited Leeds fans tweeted pictures of the Italian watching on from the stands as the Yorkshire club entered another new dawn.

The Italian was all smiles as he watched his Leeds team under new boss Milanic from the Griffin Park stands 

It was the first time new Serbian coach Darko Milanic had taken charge of the team since arriving from Austrian outfit Sturm Graz.  

And to prove he was enjoying the football experience, Cellino was photographed munching on a hotdog outside Griffin Park. 

The latest sensational story surrounding Cellino came a day after his reign as Leeds owner was said to be under renewed threat after an Italian judge found him guilty of tax evasion. 

And the controversial owner allegedly sacked consultant Graham Bean for rearranging the club's fixture with Reading.
