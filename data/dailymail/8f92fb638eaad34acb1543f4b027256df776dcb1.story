Muslim footballer Papiss Cisse donned Newcastle United's controversial 'Wonga' strip for the first time tonight - and it clearly worked for him as he started and scored in a friendly match.

The 28-year-old Premier League striker had earlier broken his silence in his row over the club's new sponsor, revealing he consulted Islamic teachers before deciding to pull on the team's new shirt.

Cisse made his first appearance of pre-season against Scottish side St Mirren tonight, and scored after 19 minutes with a curling shot, having been set up by Sammy Ameobi.

Cisse had been at loggerheads with 
Newcastle over the deal with payday loan company Wonga, which the 
striker said conflicted with his Muslim beliefs.

The Senegalese star, who earns 
£40,000 a week, missed the club's training camp in Portugal over the 
row.

But he insists he is now ready to concentrate on his game and was 
spotted training in kit carrying the Wonga branding.

'I have had some useful discussions 
with my club, my family and Islamic teachers in the last few weeks,' he said.

'Although I did not go to Portugal on the training camp, I was back here working hard on my fitness and preparing for the start of the new season.

'Since then it has been great to be training with my team-mates again. I feel great and ready to go, and cannot wait to be out there against St Mirren on Tuesday and to play my part for the team.'

'After a huge amount of thought and reflection I have made the decision 
to follow my teammates and wear the kit.'

Cisse’s climbdown on the issue also came just days after a Toon Army supporter circulated a picture on the internet of the player allegedly gambling in a Newcastle casino.
