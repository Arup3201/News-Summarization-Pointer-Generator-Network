Promoter Frank Warren has admitted to receiving nearly 50 complaints about his ‘Bad Blood’ event at the ExCel in London on Saturday night.

The show, headlined by Tyson Fury’s victory over Dereck Chisora in their heavyweight rematch, was blighted by ticketing issues and a late finish.

Fans were left struggling to get home after Chisora was pulled out by his corner after the 10th round at 1.20am.

Warren told the Daily Telegraph’s Gareth Davies: ‘We had 18,500 people there and up to now we’ve probably had about 48 people complain. It was a combination of ticket issues and travel issues. They are all issues that will be dealt with. There were some duplicate tickets, obviously not from us. But, as always, we get the blame.

‘We don’t get these problems normally and it’s a lesson learnt. The inner ringside itself was sectioned off by three lots of barriers. I was very conscious of what might happen.

‘We will liaise with the police and security to ensure we deal with that. We’ve got a meeting this week to sort it out.’

Disgruntled punters posted pictures of their duplicate tickets on Twitter

Several people took to Twitter to complain about duplicate tickets with one posting a picture of two sets of three costing £75 each.

And another fan told Sportsmail: ‘At about 7pm a group of lads told me we were in their seats. I showed them our tickets and it appeared that we had exactly the same seats only we had got them from different websites.

‘This then seemed to go on all night; people saying they were in our seats and then showing us the same tickets.’

The British Boxing Board of Control confirmed that they would be looking into the show.

The board’s General Secretary Robert Smith told Sportsmail ‘I’ve had correspondence regarding a number of issues with the show; the lateness of it being one of them.

‘I’ve been in correspondence with representatives of the promoter.

‘We had a number of security meetings before the tournament and had assurances from the security people. A number of issues have come out afterwards which we will look into.

‘Our next meeting is next Wednesday and if anything needs dealing with, we will deal with it then.’
