Sitting it out: Running backs competed in afternoon drills at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, but Adam Muema, pictured, missed the training session, claiming the Lord told him he'd play for the Seattle Seahawks if he took it easy

A former San Diego State running back skipped out on workouts during Sunday's NFL Scouting Combine because he said God told him to.

Running backs competed in afternoon drills at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, but Adam Muema missed the training session, claiming the Lord told him he'd play for the Seattle Seahawks if he took it easy.

The fourth leading rusher in Aztecs history said it was his 'dream' to play for the Super Bowl-winning team.

'Can't go wrong with God,' Muema said, according to UTSandiego.com which reported that the NFL teams are aware of the decision.

Muema explained his curious move in a phone interview from the Indianapolis International Airport as he was returning to the city where he trained for the combine.

He'll have another chance to impress NFL teams at San Diego State's pro day next month.

'(God) told me to sit down, be quiet, and enjoy the peace,' he said of his current plan, adding that he communicates with God through numbers.

Muema is regularly sharing his religious
 beliefs on social media and quoting the Bible on his Twitter account, 
Facebook and Instagram.

In 2013, the running back rushed 256 times for 1,244 yards and 15 touchdowns, UTSandiego.com reports.

Dream: The fourth leading rusher in Aztecs history, pictured in December's Idaho Potato Bowl, said it was his 'dream' to play for the Super Bowl-winning team

He declared for the draft last month as an early-entry junior and the NFL Draft Advisory Board initially predicted him to be a fourth to seventh-round pick, a source told the news website.

Other players, including Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel, decided not to throw on Sunday.

However, Muema appears to be the only player who opted out because he was 'following God.'
