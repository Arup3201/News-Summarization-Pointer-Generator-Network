A woman who turned 100 years old decided to do something that she'd never forget to celebrate her big day by going skydiving.

Eleanor Cunningham, 100, from Howes Cave, New York, did the birthday jump on Saturday at Saratoga Skydiving in Gansevoort.

The daring great-great-grandmother kissed her seven-month-old great-great-granddaughter before suiting up for the incredible  jump.

But it turns out that this was not her first time.

She, is, in fact, an experienced skydiver having taken up the  sport at age 90. 

Four years ago at the ripe old age of 95, Cunningham took to the skies again.

However,  her latest jump on Saturday was done with tandem master Dean McDonald of Saratoga Skydiving who said that Cunningham was his oldest jump partner yet.

Cunningham, who lives with her granddaughter in their Schoharie County home in central New York was reportedly very excited about this jump.

She has even managed to outdo former President George H.W. Bush with her bold stunt, because he was 90 when he last skydived.

Shortly after she landed, Cunningham, dressed in a red suit and sneakers, smiled and beamed with delight as members of her family recorded every moment on their cell phones. 

She has five children, 14 grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren, and three great, great grandchildren and credits her longevity to being a vegetarian and being around young people.

Her doctor signed off on the skydiving expedition telling her 'that she was more than capable of doing what she loves.'
