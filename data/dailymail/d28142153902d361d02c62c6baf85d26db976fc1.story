When Ashley Young was a teenager trying to make his way through the Watford Academy, an emergency meeting was called at the club to discuss his future.

Academy coaches fought for Young to be given a professional contract, others at the club felt he was too slight and small and had no future in the tough hard world of professional football.

The academy coaches won, and Young has since commanded big money moves first from Watford to Aston Villa for almost £10million, and then on to Manchester United for up to £20m.

Waste of talent: Ashley Young's days at Old Trafford look numbered following a string of inconsistent performances and the arrival of £59m signing Angel Di Maria 

No Angel for Young: The arrival of Di Maria from Real Madrid will likely spell the end of Young's time at United

Tainted reputation: Young collapses to the floor under the slightest of contact from Sunderland's Wes Brown

Going down: Young was booked for his elaborate tumble as United's penalty appeals were waved away

Young has done well from the game and at times – certainly at Villa – he has looked like a special talent. But in his three years at United he has convinced nobody that he is comfortable at that level.

Worse than that he has a reputation as a diver, which might make those supportive academy coaches squirm after they backed him so much in his youth.

And now record-breaking Angel di Maria is on his way to Old Trafford for a huge fee – that’s how desperate United are for quality out wide. Never mind Angel, Di Maria might as well be the Grim Reaper as far as Young is concerned.

Propping up the bar at the last chance saloon at Sunderland on Sunday, Young had the opportunity to stake one last claim in front of Louis van Gaal. But as cross after cross went straight to an opposition player, time was surely called on Young’s big club adventure.

Tumble: Young goes down in the box playing for England against Montenegro in a 2010 Euro qualifier

Not only can you question whether Young is good enough to be a wing-back under Van Gaal at United, you can ask if he is even good enough to be on the wing.

If it is to be the end of Young’s time at Manchester United he will only be remembered as a diver. 

His England career already appears to be finished – he hasn’t played for almost a year for Roy Hodgson’s side. He will go down as one of many England players to have missed a penalty in a shootout at a tournament. Young nearly broke the crossbar from the spot in Kiev in Euro 2012.

There are many examples of English players who have promised so much but ultimately delivered so little. Young is another. He was showcasing his talents superbly until he moved to Manchester United.

Out of patience: Louis Van Gaal has given Young a chance to impress him but he hasn't taken it 

At that point, his wages rocketed, and with Sir Alex Ferguson taking more of a back seat before retiring, there was less and less pressure to perform. The imagination and creativity he played with at Villa seemed to evaporate from his game, and frankly he now looks ordinary.

Shame, especially after all the support he received when he was given so much support as a youth team player at Watford. Those coaches who believed in him back then will wonder where the hunger went. 

Unfortunately, Young is not the only English talent to hit a ceiling, and fail to break through it. He’s not the only one at United either.
