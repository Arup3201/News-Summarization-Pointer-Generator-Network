The State of Georgia executed an 'intellectually disabled' man for murdering a fellow inmate while in prison.

Warren Lee Hill was killed by lethal injection, despite please from his attorneys who said he has the cognitive capacity of a child.

Officials confirmed that he died at 7:55pm Tuesday at the state prison in Jackson, Georgia

Executed: Warren Lee Hill was confirmed dead at 7:55pm by officials in Jackson, Georgia's state prison

Earlier his attorneys asked the Supreme Court to stay his execution on the grounds that his mental impairment made him ineligible for the death penalty.

The court refused. 

His lawyers have claimed Hill had an IQ or just 70, though state lawyers said other tests had given results of 90.  

Hill was sentenced to death for the 1991 murder of Joseph Handspike, a fellow inmate at the prison where he was being held for killing his girlfriend in 1986.

According to local news station WBSTV, he attacked Joseph Handspike with a nail-studded board and beat him to death.

Protest: Many had gathered in the hope that Warren's execution would be stayed because of his mental condition

Argument: Lawyers for Hill tried to get the Supreme Court to intervene - but they did not stay the execution

Georgia corrections officials said that Hill declined to request a last meal. As such he was given Shepherd pie with mashed potatoes, and fruit punch to drink. He made no final statement.

A statement from his lawyers, issued after the Supreme Court decision but before Hill was killed, said: 'Tonight, Georgia will unconstitutionally execute Mr. Hill, a man with the emotional and cognitive ability of a young boy. This execution is an abomination.'

They had brought dozens of witnesses and experts who said Warren was not of sound mind, but say that Georgia's standard of proof for mental capacity are so high that they are impossible to meet in practice.

His execution date had been set three times before, but each time the courts issued temporary stays in response to new legal challenges.
