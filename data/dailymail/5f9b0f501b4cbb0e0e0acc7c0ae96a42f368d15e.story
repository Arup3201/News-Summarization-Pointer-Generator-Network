Drowned: David Cox had died after his car rolled into an icy river while he was on the school run

The wife of a man who died yesterday when his car skidded into an icy river has praised her children's bravery after they tried to save their father.

David and Ruth Cox were driving their children to school in separate cars when both vehicles slid into the river only moments apart.

Mrs Cox, 39, and the couple's children Ioan, nine, and Tess, 11, managed to escape the flooding vehicles.

But as the rest of his family fled, BBC worker Mr Cox, 42, was said to have been unconscious in the front of his blue Toyota Aygo

Mrs Cox, 39, said she was 'very proud' of son Ioan and daughter Tess, who raised the alarm with neighbours after escaping the freezing water.

In an heartfelt statement, Mrs Cox said: 'We were a very happy family and I will do my utmost to make us a happy family again.'

She described how Tess 'held her breath and dived under the water' in an attempt to flee the vehicle, before swimming to the far riverbank.

Witnesses described how the children ran to cottages three-quarters of a mile down the remote path, as Ioan told neighbours ‘Daddy’s 
trapped’.

Mrs Cox also praised her nine-year-old son for 'keeping calm' while the car was 'filling with water' and attempting to break the back window.

Recalling the incident on the River Wye, only half-a-mile from 
the family’s cottage at Blackwell Mill, near Buxton, Derbyshire, she said: 'We were both able to get out of the car 
and onto the river bank.

Father-of-two David Cox has died after he and his wife crashed their cars while taking their children to separate schools

'I am very proud of how they ran back down the 
lane to the cottages to raise the alarm.'

She described her husband David as a 'wonderful, loving father, husband, brother and son' - adding that he 'loved living at Blackwell Mill and working for the BBC'.

Mrs Cox also reserved praise for her 'wonderful' friends and neighbours, as well as the rescue workers involved.

After the incident, neighbours and Mrs Cox frantically tried to free Mr Cox but it was 
around 40 minutes before he was carried to the riverbank.

A lack of 
mobile phone signal in the area and the icy conditions meant emergency 
services arrived 30 minutes after the cars left the road.

After the incident both the Aygo and the second vehicle, a silver Toyota Rav4, 
could be seen upturned side by side in the river.

Emergency vehicles and personnel, including Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, local mountain rescue volunteers, land ambulances, and the air ambulance were called to the scene

The vehicles were later removed from the freezing river as emergency services, including local mountain rescue services, flocked to the scene.

Neighbour Victoria Bamber, 32, who was the first person alerted to the 
accident by Ioan, waded into the icy water and battled in vain to save 
BBC worker Mr Cox.

She said: ‘Ioan came banging on the door saying, “There’s been an 
accident, Daddy is trapped”. 

'When I got to the scene I could only see 
the silver 4x4 upside down in the water and Ruth was desperately trying 
to find David. I jumped in the water. It was freezing cold and came 
above my waist. I kept diving down but I could not see anything.

‘The 4x4 had landed up against the driver’s door (of the Aygo) so David 
couldn’t get out. The rear window was smashed and I think that was how 
Tess had managed to get out of the car.

'We were trying to get in through 
the passenger door but we couldn’t move it. Then I picked up a large 
rock and smashed the window. The electrics gave out and the central 
locking failed and we got the door open.’

Mrs Cox and both children freed themselves from the vehicles

She said she helped drag Mr 
Cox from the car, before the emergency services began CPR on the 
riverside.

The family were airlifted to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, 20 
miles away, but while the mother and children were released after 
treatment, Mr Cox could not be saved.

Mrs Bamber said she was in ‘total shock’ at what had unfolded. ‘I can’t 
imagine what Ruth is feeling right now. She did everything she could. 
She did her best to get David out.

‘Now I’m left thinking I let her and the children down. I did my best but it was not enough.’

The slow flowing river was about 3ft deep at the accident scene. Locals 
described the condition of the track as appalling, with ice on top of 
frozen snow.

The family only moved in to the £250,000 property a year 
ago.

Caitlin Blake, a former neighbour of the couple, from Alton, Hampshire, described Mr Cox as a 'lovely man'.

The 33-year-old said: 'David and Ruth were so close. When they lived here they were very private and spent nearly all of their time together. David was always a loving father.'

Another former neighbour added: 'David was very family orientated and spent a lot of his time with his children.

Police vehicles at the scene of the tragedy in Buxton. A police spokesman described the incident as a 'tragic accident'

Rescue teams recover Mr Cox's car. The parents were taking their children to school when the tragedy happened just after 8.30am yesterday morning

'He would always lend a hand and see if I was all right as I live on my own.'

Colleagues of Mr Cox, who worked for the BBC as part of the Future Media team in Salford, paid tribute to him.

His job entailed coverage of the Olympics for the corporation's red button service, the interactive text and video system accessed through televisions.

Tim Davie, the BBC's acting director general, said: 'We are very sad to learn of David's tragic death.

'He was a popular member of the Future Media team in Salford and had been key to the success of the red button service during the Olympics in the summer.

'Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues here at the BBC at this difficult time.'

Roux Joubert, head of TV and mobile platforms, said: 'David was an important member of the team and played a central role in the department.

'He will be sorely missed by everyone here and our thoughts are with his family at this time."

One of the neighbours said: ‘It’s a really treacherous path along 
by the river, they haven’t been here long, perhaps they just weren’t 
aware of how dangerous it can be when it’s been snowing.’

Paul Hawker of Buxton fire station said: ‘You can only imagine what his 
family and neighbours went through. They must have been frantic.’

A police spokesman said the death was a ‘tragic accident’ and said they had launched an investigation into the incident.

Last night, forecasters warned up to six inches of snow could fall over 
northern Britain today, with between two and four inches falling across 
the rest of the country.
