An ocean mapping expedition has found four sea floor 'bridges' across the deepest place on Earth, the 1,500-mile long, 6.8 mile deep Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean near Guam.

Some of the 'sea mounts' are 2,500 metres tall, and form bridges across the trench as one tectonic plate is pulled under another.

Using a multibeam echo sounder, scientists also measured Earth's deepest point, Challenger Deep more precisely than ever before.

The researchers used a ship armed with state-of-the-art echo sounders to create a 3D 'map' of the world's deepest point

The 'bridges' across the trench are created when one tectonic plate is pulled underneath another, 'scraping' mountains into the form of bridges across the trench

Mapping the entire Mariana Trench with shipboard scanners from August until October 2010, the researchers discovered four bridges spanning the trench.

The bridges rise as high as 2,500 meters above its floor.

While satellite images had suggested the trench might be spanned by one such ridge, Gardner says the mapping mission confirmed the existence of four such features.

'That got me excited,' he says.

The ridges are being formed as the 180-million-year-old Pacific and far younger Philippine tectonic plates collide.

Because the ocean's crust cools as it ages, 'The Pacific crust is much, much older, so it's diving underneath the Philippine plate,' Gardner says.

As seamounts on the Pacific plate are pulled beneath the Philippine plate - 'subduction' - they are compacted against the wall of the trench, forming these ridges.

Gardner suspects that the bridges are 
related to earthquake subduction zones, such as the one that caused the 
March 2011 earthquake in Japan.

'It's incredibly complex geology. These seamounts are getting jammed up against the plate,' Gardner says.

The expedition also yielded the most precise measurement yet of Challenger Deep, the trench's (and the Earth's) deepest point, finding it to be 10,994 meters deep, plus or minus 40 meters.

Calculated from thousands of depth soundings as well as detailed analysis of how the how the water can alter the echo sounding signals, the new measurement is similar to other claims of the Challenger Deep's depth, some of which are deeper.

'When you're dealing with something that's 11 kilometers deep, you have to deal with inherent uncertainties in the system,' says Gardner, noting that Challenger Deep is deeper than Mount Everest is high.Multibeam echo sounders measure depth by sending sound energy to the ocean floor then analyzing the returning signal.

Mounted beneath a ship, the instruments produce a fan-shaped swath of coverage of the seafloor.

The resolution of the resulting images, at one pixel to every 100 meters, is far more precise than other earlier measurement systems.

Hydrographers and ocean mappers such as Armstrong and Gardner describe the process of mapping an area as like 'mowing the lawn,' making overlapping tracks over the area in question.
