A Brooklyn Nets superfan who had to be carried out from a game  amid claims that he attacked another supporter with his prosthetic leg earlier this month, has died.

Jeffrey Vanchiro, 38, died after falling from a window on the second floor of his father's house in Flushing, Queens, on Saturday night.

Mr Vanchiro, a former professional poker player also known as Jeffrey Gamblero, allegedly jumped from the building in a disorientated state.

Tragedy: Brooklyn Nets superfan Jeffrey Vanchiro, 38, died after falling from a window on the second floor of a residential property in Flushing, Queens

Mr Vanchiro had become known fellow Nets fans for his dedication to the team, unique outfits and dancing during games.

His fiance said that Mr Vanchiro had behaved erratically since being ejected from the Nets vs. Knicks game at Madison Square Garden on December 2.

'After that, he was a completely different person,' Kristi Evans told The New York Times.

'He was paranoid. He was erratic. He was frightened. He was horrified. He was a bit delusional. 

'He was having a lot of trouble sleeping. He couldn’t sleep at all. When he would sleep, or try to sleep, it would only take about 10 or 15 minutes before he would jump up screaming covered in sweat.'

His fiance said Mr Vanchiro had behaved erratically since being ejected from the Nets vs. Knicks game at Madison Square Garden on December 2

According to witnesses, Mr Vanchiro had been ejected from the venue after removing his prosthetic limb and using it to hit another fan  in the upper deck of the arena.

Video shows how he was hauled from his seat and physically removed by two members of staff amid fears the situation could escalate. 

The drama unfolded with around five minutes to play in the third quarter of Brooklyn’s 98-93 win over the New York Knicks.

The New York Daily News quotes a staffer as saying: ‘They grabbed him and pulled him out. I don’t know if he was arrested but they got him out of there so he didn’t start a riot.’ 

The report says some eyewitnesses dispute the version of events given by Garden security and that he did not attack anyone.

After the incident, the man was named on social media as Nets ‘super fan’ Jeffrey Gamblero

One unidentified fan is quoted as saying: ‘I saw what happened. He didn’t deserve to be thrown out. He was just into the game.’

Video posted online by @jeigs, New York comedian Jesse Eigner, showed how the fan, who was dressed in Brooklyn Nets clothing, was carried away from his seat without his prosthetic leg while stunned supporters watched on.

A Knicks spokesman said: ‘An unruly fan was ejected after MSG security received multiple complaints from fans sitting in that area.

‘The fan was warned multiple times before being removed. He will not be permitted back into Madison Square Garden.’
