That was a really important innings for Ian Bell.

There had been a lot of focus going into this game on the senior players’ lack of contribution, and after Alastair Cook responded with 95 on Sunday, that left Bell among the batsmen needing to perform.

This was just what he needed — and it was a pleasure to watch.

Stand up and be counted: Ian Bell stepped up when it mattered to hit 167 against India

Double act: Ian Bell and debutant Jos Buttler inspired England into a commanding position

Bell’s previous Test hundred was 20 
innings ago, at the end of the home Ashes series where he’d been the 
only England batsman to stand up to the Australians. In that series, he 
perfected the late cut on slow, low pitches — a stroke he was encouraged
 to play because Michael Clarke took men out of the slips and didn’t 
always protect third man.

I
 think Bell managed to train the brain to play the shot, and it brought 
him a lot of runs. But since then, on bouncier surfaces, he had failed 
to adapt.

When there is more life in the track for the seamers, the late cut becomes a more dangerous option. You have to be careful.

The signs in this innings were that he was alive to the risk.

Bell generally shelved the shot until the pitch got a bit slower and lower, and the Indian bowlers tired.

I also liked the way he chose the moment to attack.

Long time coming: Ian Bell had not hit a Test century in 20 innings

In
 the past, Bell has been in the shadow of the likes of Kevin Pietersen 
and even Jonathan Trott. Now he’s the senior man in that middle order, 
and that means seizing the moment. The way he went after Ravindra Jadeja
 in the afternoon session was a sign he was happy to take 
responsibility.

It’s a subtle change of mindset for a guy who now needs to show the likes of Joe Root and Gary Ballance the way ahead.

Bell
 also went past 7,000 Test runs during the course of that onslaught, and
 into England’s top 10 Test runscorers, ahead of Andrew Strauss.

I
 remember Darren Gough motivating himself by carrying around a list of 
Test wicket-takers, and ticking them off as he went past them. Perhaps 
Bell could now do the same, because he’s achieved plenty of other things
 in his career: 100 Tests, 21 hundreds, Ashes wins.

Seeing
 himself overhaul some of the great names in English batting may be just
 the motivation he needs as he moves into the last few years of his 
career.
