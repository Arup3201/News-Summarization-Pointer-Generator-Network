Have you ever thought about how fast you’re spinning on Earth’s axis?

Even
 when you finally relax in front of the TV, you’re 
still spinning at a dizzying speed of over 600mph if you’re in the UK.

Using
 this map, you can search for where your line of latitude crosses the 
black curve to determine the speed you’re spinning in the cosmos.

The graphic was created by Oregon-based Seth Kadish who wanted to find a way for people think about their existence in a broader sense.

According to the graphic, the speed at which your area of the planet is moving can vary between 0 and 1040mph.

‘Basically, I'm a geologist who loves math,’ Mr Kadish told MailOnline. ‘Every once in a while, I tackle a fun thought experiment or back-of-the-envelope calculation related to the natural world.’

The result was the graphic that reveals the speed of a point on Earth's surface for any given latitude as a result of the rotation of the Earth about its axis.

The values on the graph are accurate to within about 1 mph (1.6 km/hr) of your actual speed.  

It does not take into account our rotation around the sun into account, which is roughly 67,000 mph orbital speed.

An object on the Earth's equator 
travels once around the Earth's circumference. This is about 24,901 
miles (40,075 kilometres) per day.

To calculate speed, Mr Kadish divided that distance by 23hr, 56m, 4s to reach the figure of 1,040 mph.

After that, speed due to rotation was calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude at the point.

‘The largest error introduced is probably the fact that you have to estimate your location on the curve based on where you live, then read your speed off the x-axis,’ said Mr Kadish.

After that, speed due to rotation was calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude at the point.

The calculation assumes that the Earth is a perfect sphere, which isn’t the case. . 

There is also some variability in speed introduced by the altitude of a given location, but the effect is very minor.

‘If, hypothetically, Mt. Everest’s peak and the deepest part of the Mariana Trench were both located along the equator, the difference in tangential speed caused by the 12.3 mile elevation difference would only be about 3 mph,’ said Mr Kadish.

‘I am partial to maps because my education focused heavily on geographic information systems,’ said Mr Kadish. ‘But sometimes all you need is a good graph to make the data beautiful.’
