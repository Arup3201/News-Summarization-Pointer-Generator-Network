Guilty plea: Shaun Ruane, pictured outside Burnley Magistrates Court, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm of Hayley Truelove

A teenager ran over his girlfriend and left her lying in the road after finding out she was expecting his first child.

Shaun Ruane, 19, had been in a relationship with Hayley Truelove for three months when she found out she was ten weeks pregnant and announced she wanted to keep the child.

Bricklayer Ruana said he would stand by her but the next day erupted into a rage and ran over Miss Truelove, also 19, before driving off.

He admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving but was given a suspended youth custody order.

Burnley magistrates heard the bricklayer’s mind was 'all over the place' at the time because of his concerns over the unplanned pregnancy.

There had been discussions between their families about the child but 19-year-old Miss Truelove made the decision to keep the baby the night before the incident on August 2.

Ruane, from Burnley, Lancs, was said to be a 'little upset' by the decision, but decided to support Miss Truelove who he began dating in May.

Prosecutor Andrew Robinson told the court the couple went out in his Ford Fiesta but he began 'showing off' behind the wheel and driving too fast.

The court heard Ruane kept jerking the steering wheel after Ms Truelove asked him to not to, saying repeatedly: 'Please stop, I’m pregnant.'

But Mr Robinson said Ruane just 'didn’t seem to care that his driving was making her upset'.

Miss Truelove asked Ruane to stop the car as she wanted to get out because she didn’t feel safe.

She opened the door, undid her seat belt and placed her left leg on the road when he sped off across the junction.

Miss Truelove fell out of the van onto the road and the rear passenger wheel went over her right ankle and foot. 

Ruane then shouted abuse at Miss Truelove and punched his own van before driving off for a second time. He surrendered himself to the police about an hour and 20 minutes later.

Miss Truelove was taken to hospital by ambulance and treated for a serious sprain.

In court: Ruane was given a 17 week youth custody order suspended for one year at Burnley Magistrates Court, pictured

Ruane who has since lost his job, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving.

He was given a 17 week youth custody, suspended for a year, and was ordered to complete 200 hours unpaid work. He was also banned from driving for 15 months, must take an extended retest and was ordered to pay £100 compensation and £85 costs.

In mitigation defence lawyer Rachel Griffiths said: 'His mind was in overdrive and all over the place as he didn’t know how both of them were going to cope after the pregnancy news.

'He will say he didn’t realise the car door was open. If he had realised it was open, he would have stopped and allowed her to alight from the vehicle.'

Miss Griffiths told the court Ruane immediately returned to the scene, almost hitting a tractor, when he looked in his wing mirror and saw his partner by the roadside.

He got out to check she was OK, but was approached by a man who accused him of pushing her out of the van and simply didn’t know what to do. The solicitor said : 'Rather foolishly, and the thing he regrets more than anything, he drove off.'

Miss Griffiths added: 'At no stage during this incident has he tried to evade the consequences of what would come. He is truly remorseful for the way things have turned out. The defendant is hopeful of a reconciliation with his partner. If he could turn the clock back, he would.'

Miss Truelove was not at court. Her family declined to comment.
