It has now been seen by millions, but David Cameron's sister-in-law's snap of the Prime Minister taking a nap was only meant for eight people.

The photograph was taken by Emily Sheffield as her sister Alice prepared for her wedding day and posted on Instagram, apparently not realising it could be seen by anyone.

.And there in the background is the Prime Minister – barefoot, fast asleep, one hand behind his head and with his red dispatch box full of ministerial correspondence on the bed next to him

Whoops: Emily Sheffield insisted she did not mean for the world to see the Prime Minister having a doze

Gaffe: Emily Sheffield admitted posting the picture on Instagram without realising anyone could see it

The G20 summit in St Petersburg had obviously taken its toll on him, where he was locked in talks over Syria through the night. 

So
 after flying back from Russia, Britain's political leader enjoyed a 
quick snooze as his wife Samantha's sister Alice Sheffield got ready to 
marry Etienne Cadestin on Saturday, September 7, near York.

The PM came under fire earlier in the
 day when he left the box unattended on the train journey to Miss 
Sheffield’s wedding venue.

Passengers spotted the case as he wandered to another part of the train.

Mrs Cameron and her half-sister Alice are the daughters of baronet Sir Reginald Sheffield.

The picture was posted on Instagram but quickly spread online before it was hastily deleted after realising the mistake.

Today Emily Sheffield wrote on Twitter: 'Ok so I am the idiot today. For the record I had 8 followers when posted, all family and friends, then forgot to remove it #amateur'.

As if to add to his collection of photographs with his ministerial red box, Mr Cameron posted the latest on his Twitter account.

The Prime Minister was seen wearing denim to mark Jeans for Genes day, working on official papers.

Sir Reginald, the eighth baronet Sheffield, married Miss Sheffield mother Victoria Walker – now Lady Sheffield – after he and Mrs  Cameron’s mother Annabel divorced in 1974.

David and Samantha Cameron chat to another guest at the wedding of Alice Sheffield which took place in York earlier this month

Her new husband, Etienne Cadestin, 27, is a senior sustainability and energy consultant for estate agents Knight Frank.

The
 candid shot from a fortnight ago was posted by the bride’s sister Emily
 on her Instagram account, which could be seen by anyone on the website.

It was removed after commentators noticed the PM’s surprise appearance.

Downing
 Street insisted that claims of a security breach were ‘nonsense’, and 
that a member of Mr Cameron’s police protection team was keeping watch 
at all times.

The Prime Minister was accused of leaving the box which contains official documents unattended while travelling to the wedding in York
