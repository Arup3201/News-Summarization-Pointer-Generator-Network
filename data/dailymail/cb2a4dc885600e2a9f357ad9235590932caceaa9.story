Four marines were killed on a US base during a routine maintenance operation.

The group were clearing the firing range at Camp Pendleton, California, of unexploded ordnance when they were killed, CBS reports.

Marine Corps have confirmed investigators are currently establishing the cause of the accident.

There was no live firing on the range at the time of the sweep for explosive materials.

The identities of the four Marines will be release after their next of kin are notified.

'We offer our heartfelt prayers and condolences to the families of the Marines lost today in this tragic accident. Our first priority is to provide the families with the support they need during this difficult time,' said Brig. Gen. John W. Bullard, commanding general of the Marine Corps Installations West at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.

In March this year, seven Marines were killed during a training exercise in Nevada.

The mortar blast occurred at the Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada, which houses and disposes of ammunition.

The Marines immediately issued an indefinite moratorium on firing of all such mortars worldwide until an investigation clears as safe the type of weapon and ammunition in the tragedy.

The 60mm mortar is a 
weapon that traditionally requires three to four Marines to operate, but
 it's common during training for others to observe nearby.

A military investigation determined human error was to blame for that accident. A marine operating a 60 mm mortar tube and ammunition did not follow correct procedures, resulting in the detonation of a high explosive round at the mortar position, a report said.

The investigation also determined that the mortar team involved in the accident had not conducted 'appropriate preparatory training.'
