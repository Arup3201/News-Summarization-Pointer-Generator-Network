The 26-year-old also triumphed in the World Cup event held at the same venue on Saturday. She is third in the overall World Cup standings heading into the final round in Sochi - 53 points behind leader Flock.

The European Championships had been moved to Igls after weather problems forced the cancellation of the scheduled event at La Plagne in France.

Yarnold later tweeted: 'I am hugely proud to say that I am the 2015 European Champion! Today was a dream come true.'
