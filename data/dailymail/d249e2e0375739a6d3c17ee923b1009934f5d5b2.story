Derby have been given a swift rebuke after they enquired about the availability of QPR’s Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips for potential loan moves.

Manager Steve McClaren, who worked with both players during his spell coaching at Rangers, has indicated he would be interested in signing either player if a deal could be agreed.

However, QPR will only listen to permanent offers. They want to sell Hoilett, 24, and would consider offers for Phillips, 23, who has struggled for fitness and form since being signed from Blackpool last year.

Matt Phillips is also interesting the Championship high-fliers but the west London side dismissed an enquiry

Hull and West Brom have also asked about the two.

Hoilett arrived at Loftus Road with a fine reputation after impressing at Blackburn, and even turned down a move to then Champions League hopefuls Borussia Monchengladbach.

However, he has scored just six goals in 71 league appearances in west London, while Phillips has similarly struggled to find the net.
