Stoke City have joined the clubs showing an interest in Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani.

The
 striker has impressed for Algeria at the World Cup and scored against 
South Korea on Sunday.

Attracting interest: Stoke and West Ham are keen on Islam Slimani

He was a target for West Ham earlier in the year 
and they discussed a potential loan in January but now Sporting want to 
cash-in.

Sporting want £6.5m for the 26-year-old and that may put off Stoke and the Hammers, who are both keen to do a deal.

Slimani scored nine goals in 26 games for the Portuguese outfit last season.
