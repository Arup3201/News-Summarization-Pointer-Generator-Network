It's one of London’s most desirable addresses with five-star hotels and fabulous views over Hyde Park.

But the Romanian travellers who have descended on Park Lane are not the most welcome of visitors.

Suitcases in tow, they have taken over a patch of grass near Marble Arch and it is feared they may set up a camp.

Back on the scene: Romanian beggars have been pictured setting up camp in Marble Arch once again

Going nowhere: The group was pictured huddle together chatting or sleeping on the grass nearby

Nuisance: Others were pictures gathered in the doorway of a luggage shop drinking cups of tea

A 40-strong band did exactly that a year ago, turning the site into a rubbish dump and being accused of knife-point robberies and other crimes.

Yesterday Richard Owen, who has a burger van at Marble Arch, said the new arrivals were bad for tourism.

He said he had just seen two Romanian women ‘pull their skirts down, squat down and go to the toilet’.

He added: ‘There were tourists going by on those open-top buses, people everywhere, they didn’t care. It was absolutely disgusting.

‘The police don’t seem to be doing anything.

‘All they seem to be doing is going up and checking passports and then just let them go.

Taking a nap: It is not yet clear if these travellers are part of the same gang who blighted Marble Arch last year

Problem: Police and Westminster Council faced a long-running battle to remove the travellers last summer

Blight: The beggars have gathered in sight of some of the capital's top hotels

‘When I get here in the morning there are usually about 60-70 of them. They are drinking and begging. It’s ruining the tourism.’

Tony Carlozzi, 31, on holiday with a friend from New York, said she saw one of the group urinating in the underpass.

‘He just looked at me, he was drunk,’ she added. ‘I couldn’t believe it and I’m from New York. I don’t know why the police don’t just lock them up, that’s what would happen in America.

‘They have been begging. It is intimidating. It is the sort of thing that would put me off coming to London again.’

Britain is preparing itself for a predicted influx of Romanians – and Bulgarians – when they are given free access to our jobs market in January.

Ministers have refused to put an estimate on how many migrants will travel here but campaign group MigrationWatch has warned it could be 50,000 every year for five years from 2014.
