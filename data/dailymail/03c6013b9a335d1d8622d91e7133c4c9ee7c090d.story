Britain's most reviled female criminals are living in the same seaside town, it has been claimed.

The mother of Baby P, Tracey Connelly, Maxine Carr – the former girlfriend of double child killer Ian Huntley – and kidnapper Karen Matthews are said to have homes close to each other in the resort.

Although their location cannot be named for legal reasons, sightings of the notorious trio have already provoked comment on social networking sites.

Furious locals have complained that the town is being used as a ‘dumping ground’ for criminals.

One wrote online: ‘What did we do to deserve them?’ Another resident said: ‘It’s incredible, even bizarre that they are all living here. Everyone is talking about it.’

The town dubbed the ‘monsters-by-the-sea resort’ has a ready supply of low-cost housing. It also has a high turnover of visitors and casual workers which should make it harder to identify ex-convicts. But this has not prevented residents from recognising their infamous faces.

Carr, 38, who provided a false alibi to Huntley after he killed ten-year-old schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002, has already been moved from one address because of the reaction of people living in the area.

Her ex-boyfriend is still serving a minimum jail term of 40 years. Carr, who served 21 months in jail, was granted a lifetime anonymity order by the High Court ten years ago which bars the identification of her whereabouts or her new identity.

She is one of only four offenders ever to get a new identity at the expense of the taxpayer. Following her release from prison in May 2004, she had dental work in an attempt to change her appearance.

Karen Matthews, 39, who faked the kidnap of her own daughter to claim £50,000 reward money has also been seen in the seaside resort

Earlier this year she married her long-term boyfriend who is said to be ‘besotted’, despite knowing about her past. In October 2011 she gave birth to a son, who is unlikely to ever know his mother’s real identity due to the strict terms of the order.

She is apparently working for ten hours a week in one of the resort’s shops. One person who claimed he was served by her told the Sunday People: ‘It suddenly clicked who she was. She is very distinctive.’

Also living in the town is Connelly, 33, who let her 17-month-old son Peter be tortured to death. She was released from prison a year ago after being jailed in 2009 and now lives in a two-bedroom flat. When she was granted parole, Connelly begged for an anonymity order, a flat near Blackpool’s seaside attractions and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused.

Carr, 38, served 21 months in jail for providing Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered two schoolgirls

Huntley was given a double life sentence after he was convicted of the murder of Holly Wells (left) and Jessica Chapman (right)

Maxine Ann Carr was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2003 for perverting the course of justice.

She provided Ian Huntley, who she was dating at the time, with a false alibi after he killed Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002. 

Carr, was the girls' teaching assistant at St Andrew's Primary School, Soham, Cambridgeshire.

Her failure to expose Huntley's lies in the early stages of the investigation meant that police initially eliminated him as a suspect.

It took the police nearly two weeks to arrest and charge him.

The court accepted that Carr had only lied to the police to protect Huntley because she believed his claims of innocence and so found her not guilty of assisting an offender. 

Instead she was given a grant of £750 to decorate and furnish a flat elsewhere, £400 a month housing benefit and jobseekers’ allowance.

Last week the 24-stone junk food addict, who is still under the supervision of probation officers, was said to be unhappy after being recognised at a GP surgery in the resort. Karen Matthews, who was jailed for the kidnap of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon in a plot to pocket a £50,000 reward, is also said to have requested a seaside flat when she was freed in 2012.

The 39-year-old mother of seven served four years in jail, and will remain on licence for the rest of her eight-year sentence. When she was released, she was given a makeover to prevent her being recognised.

She lives under an assumed name and has signed on at the local Jobcentre. A resident on one of the resort’s estates where she apparently lives said: ‘She has put on so much weight that you can’t fail to notice her. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was 30 stone.’

Yesterday criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher said: ‘Normally offenders are dispersed. Certain seaside towns have disproportionate numbers living far from home to maintain their anonymity. But I have never heard of three high-profile offenders in the same area, it’s too risky. It’s extraordinary.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said yesterday: ‘We have some of the toughest measures in the world to manage serious offenders in the community and public protection is always our top priority.’ 

Peter, who was referred to as 'Baby P', was found dead in his blood-spattered after suffering 50 injuries

Karen Matthews faked the kidnap of her  daughter Shannon, then nine, in 2008 to claim £50,000 reward money.

She was sentenced to eight years in jail for child neglect, kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.

The girl was found in a house which belonged to Michael Donovan, uncle of Craig Meehan - the boyfriend of the kidnapped girl's mother.

Her disappearance sparked a major missing person operation and it was compared to the police search for Madeleine McCann

When she gave evidence she denied having anything to do with her daughter's disappearance, claiming that Craig Meehan told her to 'take the blame'.

She said she did so because she was scared of him.

Tracey Connelly was jailed for  five years in 2009 after admitting causing or allowing her son Peter's death. 

'Baby P' died in August 2007 with more than 50 injuries, despite being on a social services "at-risk" register.

His death at home in Tottenham, north London, came a day after police told his mother she would not be prosecuted over abuse of the 17-month-old.

Social workers, health professionals and police officers had visited 60 times in eight months.

Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker, and his brother Jason Owen were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child.

Peter, who was 17-months-old, was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at Connelly's flat with a broken back.
