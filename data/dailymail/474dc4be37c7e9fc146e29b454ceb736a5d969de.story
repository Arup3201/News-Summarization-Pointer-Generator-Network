Manuel Pellegrini admitted that some of his World Cup stars could miss the start of the Premier League season after seeing Manchester City lose in a penalty shootout to Liverpool in New York.

Joe Hart, James Milner, Edin Dzeko and Yaya Toure all played a part at Yankee Stadium after joining up with City’s squad in the United States last Thursday along with David Silva.

But Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Fernandinho and captain Vincent Kompany are not due to report back for pre-season training until Monday after reaching the latter stages of the World Cup in Brazil, and Pellegrini knows they will have less than two weeks to get fit for the start of the Premier League season.

Arsenal, City’s opponents in the Community Shield in 10 days’ time, have already written off some of their key players for the big kick-off and Pellegrini may have to do the same.

He said: ‘The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko, I think that they will be ready for the Premier League. 

‘We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it.

‘We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We’ve had a very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League.

‘We have a very good squad but this pre-season we have a lot of players who cannot play. We’re happy with the squad, not only the team. That’s why it’s important for all these players to take their chance when they get it.’

The Premier League champions led twice through Stevan Jovetic goals in the second half but were pegged back and beaten in the shootout by the team they tipped to the title on the final day of last season.

‘It was a very useful game for both teams,’ added Pellegrini. ‘We played better than Liverpool in the first 45 minutes and 0-0 wasn’t exactly what happened.

‘In the second half we continued playing well. Joe Hart made some very good saves and we also missed some goals especially at 2-1. Finally, the penalties. One team must win and on this day it was Liverpool’s turn.

‘Liverpool are a very good team, today they played very well. Last season they had a very good season and I’m sure that this year they be fighting for the title again.

‘We’re trying to continue in the same way we started last season. It was a very good season but that season has finished. We must now start fighting again for every competition we play.

‘I hope we have the ambition to do it and that’s why I’m happy with the way we have prepared in pre-season. We will continue being an important team. Of course other teams want to win as well but I trust a lot in my players.’ 

The City boss also paid tribute to Jovetic who has now scored four goals in the last two games after an injury-hit first season in England.

‘I’ve already said that Stevan is a very important player for us, that’s why he came into the squad last year,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He had different kinds of injuries but at the moment he is working normally and I’m sure if he continues in this way he will demonstrate why he is here.

‘He’s a top player and he has scored in every game in pre-season. If he’s fit all the year he will be a very important player for us.’
