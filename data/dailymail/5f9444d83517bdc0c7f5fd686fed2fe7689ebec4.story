On trial: Max Clifford arriving this morning at Southwark Crown Court to hear evidence from a woman who claims he assaulted her in 1966

A schoolgirl feared she would be raped or murdered when Max  Clifford drove her down an alley and lunged at her, a court heard yesterday.

The 14-year-old was ‘frozen in fear’ and in a ‘blind panic’ as he allegedly groped at her school uniform and breasts.

The celebrity publicist was said to have approached the girl in a Wimpy fast-food bar and lured her into his car, telling her ‘there is something I would like you to see’ that she would ‘really like’.

The PR guru allegedly said she could meet her idols, US pop trio The Walker Brothers. But then he told her ‘this is what you’ve got to do’ as he threw himself on top of her, London’s Southwark Crown Court was told.

The woman, now a 62-year-old mother of two and the first  witness in Clifford’s trial, said she was ‘frozen in fear’ in the alleged 1966 indecent assault in Morden, South London.

He denies 11 counts of indecently assaulting seven women aged 14 to 19 between 1966 and 1984.

She told the jury she used to go with friends to the Wimpy bar, where Clifford would sit on his own drinking coffee. Another witness described Clifford, then in his early twenties, as an  ‘oddball’ who ‘tried to hang out’ with teenagers in the Wimpy.

On this occasion, the alleged victim said she went in alone but her friends were not there and Clifford offered her a lift home.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she refused because she only lived ‘round the corner’, but he said he had something to show her.

He was insistent, she said, adding: ‘I gave in. I was just a silly girl and I said yes.’ But instead of taking her home, he drove in ‘totally the wrong direction’, parked in a cul-de-sac under a railway bridge and took out a book of photographs of famous people, she said.

She added: ‘He got a book out and he was saying, “Look, there is me with all the stars”.’

Clifford as a young man:  Mr Clifford also laughed off suggestions his younger sibling might have borrowed his brothers' cars in 1966 or 67 - saying the PR agent didn't have a licence

Claims: Clifford allegedly offered to give a 14-year-old girl a ride home then groped her

Hearing: The PR guru insists he is innocent of all the indecent assault charges

He showed her pictures of  himself with 
Sixties bands such as The Beatles and possibly the Rolling Stones, she 
said. ‘He said, “Who do you want to meet?” I said I did not want to meet
 anyone, I just wanted to go home.’

He then asked her if there was one 
particular band she would like to meet and she named The Walker 
Brothers. She added: ‘He said, “I can arrange that” and he said, “This 
is what you have got to do” and he put my seat back.

‘When my seat was almost horizontal he lunged at me and put his body on mine and he was touching me all over.’

She said he touched her breasts while she was ‘on autopilot’.

She
 said: ‘I thought at the time that I was going to get raped if I did not
 get out of the car, I was just thinking about escaping, about whether 
the car door was locked or not.’ She said it was obvious that ‘it was a 
sexual thing’ that he wanted her to do.

She said: ‘I did not know at that stage whether I was going to be raped or murdered.

‘If someone starts driving you the wrong way you know you are in trouble.’

WOMAN ONE: One indecent assault in January 1966

WOMAN TWO: One indecent assault in 1975

WOMAN THREE: One indecent assault between July 1977 and August 1978 and on three occasions outside that period

WOMAN FOUR: One indecent assault in 1978

WOMAN FIVE: One indecent assault in 1982

WOMAN SIX: One indecent assault between January 1982 and December 1984, and another outside that period

WOMAN SEVEN: One indecent assault between January 1983 and December 1984

Eventually,
 she managed to get free and ‘ran all the way home’, she said. She never
 told police or her ‘strict’ parents, but says she did tell friends.

Under
 cross examination by Richard Horwell, QC, she denied ‘jumping on the 
bandwagon’, and insisted her claims were ‘100 per cent true’.

She
 admitted the year of the incident might have been 1967, but denied that
 ‘none of this ever happened’ and that Clifford ‘did not have a car’ in 
1966. She could not recall details of the car.

The
 court heard from four other witnesses, including her ex- husband, who 
said she had told them years ago about her ‘bad experience’ with 
Clifford.

Clifford, in a navy jacket, white shirt and striped tie with grey trousers, listened through a hearing loop from the dock.

The
 70-year-old ‘kiss-and-tell’ agent, who has represented music mogul 
Simon Cowell and the late reality TV star Jade Goody, denies all charges
 in the trial, which is expected to last up to six weeks.
