A man accused of killing his wife by repeatedly hitting her with a hammer has told a jury it was a 'do or die' situation.

Lawrence Gaskell has pleaded not guilty to murdering Katarina Gaskell during a violent argument at their home in Brisbane's north on October 17, 2011.

Gaskell told a Supreme Court jury in Brisbane on Thursday that he had never seen his former wife so angry when she lunged at him with a knife that tragic day.

He told the court they could not agree on the division of their assets, which included three properties.

Dead: Mr Gaskell alleged Mrs Gaskell 'was trying to kill me. There's no doubt about it. She had gone crazy, completely'

Mrs Gaskell had come over to one of their houses to pick up some belongings from the garage.

After opening the garage for her, Mr Gaskell said he returned to his other house to continue laying down flooring and was startled to later find his ex-wife in the kitchen.

An argument broke out between the two and Mr Gaskell said he told her that she was 'not getting the house'.

She then picked up three kitchen knives and splayed them across her chest before walking towards him while running two blades together, he said.

'I yelled at her `put the knives down, put the knives down',' he said.

'She had the serrated blade knife in her right hand and a straight blade in her left hand.'

He said she swung at him and slashed his wrist. He then picked up another knife, which he described as flimsy and tried to 'get her back'.

In the final moments of the struggle, Gaskell said Mrs Gaskell was 'growling' when he grabbed her wrist to stop her from stabbing him.

By then, she had one knife in her hand, he said.

'She was trying to kill me. There was no doubt about it. She had gone crazy, completely,' he said.

'She was angry beyond anything I had ever experienced.'

He said he stumbled backwards when she began kicking him and he was afraid she was going to overpower him.

'She was very strong. She was trying to kill me,' he said.

'It was a do or die situation. I had to do something. I couldn't restrain her.'

He said that's when he grabbed the hammer on the ladder beside him and hit her on the head. 

'I had to do something. I couldn't restrain her,' Mr Gaskell told a court

'This was a fight for life as far as I was concerned,' he said.

He said he expected the blow would knock her unconscious but was shocked when she only looked enraged and continued to attack him.

'I hit her until she dropped the knife,' he said.

'I went down with her. We both were on the floor.'

He said he had lost count of how many times he had hit her.

He rang 000 after he saw he had shattered her skull and blood was seeping out.

Mrs Gaskell died in hospital the next day.

The case has been adjourned.
