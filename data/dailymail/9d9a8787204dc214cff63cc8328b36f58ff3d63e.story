Ukrainian officials fear that a film called The Match, in which courageous Ukrainian players oppose German-speaking Nazi athletes against a backdrop of giant swastikas, may stoke anti-German feeling ahead of the Euro 2012 football tournament.

Regulators say the film could incite aggressive fans just weeks before Ukraine hosts several games played by Germany's national team during the 2012 European Championship from June 8-July 1.

'There always are people - hooligans - who use football to spill out their aggression and some of those people may be influenced by (the film),' said political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko.

A still from The Match, the controversial Russian movie depicting a legendary football match between Soviet soccer players and Nazi soldiers played in 1942 and dubbed 'the Death Match'

The film is based on the 1942 match between the Nazi occupiers and Kiev's top football team

Ukraine is freezing the release because of the potentially explosive emotions it may cause ahead of the the Euro 2012 Championship which kicks off in June

Every Ukrainian knows about the 
so-called 'Death Match' of August 9 1942, when top Kiev soccer players 
beat a team of Nazi occupiers and reputedly paid for it with their 
lives.

Ukraine's
State Cinema Agency was due to make a ruling by April 6 but it has 
delayed a decision until May 1, distributor Inter Film said.

‘The situation is unclear, Inter Film spokeswoman Yulia Yatsenko said. '(The movie) is in limbo.’

The
film tells the story of the 1942 match, which pitted a Wehrmacht team 
against players from Kiev's top club Dynamo and other athletes.

The 
Ukrainian team won 5-3 despite reported warnings from the SS that they 
must lose to their occupiers. Most team members were subsequently arrested and some were executed.

A Soviet journalist dubbed the game the 'Death Match' and Soviet authorities cultivated the legend
that the entire team was executed by the Nazis due to winning the match.

'Propaganda': The movie was set to premiere in Kiev in May, just weeks before Ukraine co-hosts the Euro 2012 football championship. But the Ukrainian cinematography agency will take another month to decide whether to release the movie

A 
monument to those players stands outside the Dynamo stadium  in Kiev and their heroism inspired the 1981 film Escape To Victory starring Sylvester Stallone and Pele.

In The Match the actor playing team captain Nikolai Ranevich says, with eyes filling with tears, 'Some things are worth dying for,' and he convinces his team to beat the Nazis in a show of resistance and patriotism.

Some historians say that while defeating the Nazi team was undoubtedly courageous, there is no evidence to suggest all the players were executed in revenge.

Nine of the players were arrested about a week after the match.

One died in custody and three others were shot in a Kiev concentration camp six months later, according to Volodymyr Prystaiko, a former Soviet security officer who wrote a book on the match.

German investigators concluded in 2005 there was no evidence linking the death of the three players to the match.

The film's distributor wanted The Match to premiere in Ukraine on May 3 and the state cinema agency was to announce its decision on whether to approve the movie last week.

But agency spokeswoman Larisa Titarenko says the regulator will take another 25 working days to analyse the movie.

Yaroslav Pidhora-Gvyazdovskiy, a member of the expert commission reviewing The Match, says he recommended banning the movie because it promotes ethnic strife. Most of the characters who collaborate with the Nazis speak Ukrainian while the admirable characters in it speak Russian and fearlessly oppose the invaders, he said.

The real thing: Kiev's historic football team called Start, made up of Dynamo players and other Ukraine athletes, who beat the Nazis despite being warned by the SS that they should deliberately lose

Independent movie critic Volodymyr Voitenko said the movie should be banned. 'It's ideological propaganda, which is part of Russia's neo-imperialist policy,' Voitenko says.

'It's a political question and the state must decide whether to allow being spat in the face or not.'

Movie producer Dmitry Kulikov has accused Ukrainian movie officials of bowing to pressure from 'radical nationalist groups.'

'There is nothing anti-Ukrainian about this movie,' Kulikov says. 'We made a movie about the heroic deed of Ukrainians and Kiev residents during the war.'

Many historians say Ukraine's role in the war is still largely 
overlooked, with Soviet 
and Ukrainian archives closed to historians for almost 50 years, but research  has shown that the country lost more people in World War II 
than any other European country.

Ukrainian losses probably numbered 10million or half of the entire USSR total and 20 per cent of the entire 
World War II total of 50million dead, according to some historians. 

The country has thousands of monuments listing the names
of those killed in World War II.

American foreign correpondent Edgar Snow, who visited Ukraine in 1943 
and at the end of the war in 1945, was astonished at the enormous losses
it had suffered and wrote, 'The Allies won the war but Ukraine paid the
bill.'
