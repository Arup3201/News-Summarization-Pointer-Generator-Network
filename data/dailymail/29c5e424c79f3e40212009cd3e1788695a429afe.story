American Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, 59, is getting better after receiving an experimental medicine, according to her son who appeared on the Today show on Tuesday.

Jeremy Writebol has been able to see his mother twice a day through a window in a special ward of Emory University Hospital and says he has noticed a remarkable change since she first returned from Liberia last week.

While he initially feared his mother might die after seeing her wheeled into the hospital on a gurney, Jeremy says doctors are now 'very optimistic' she will recover.

'She's been doing well,' Jeremy said. 'We've just seen her get physically better. Her eyes brighten up, her countenance goes up. [She's] smiling, even joking a little bit.'

Very optimistic: Jeremy Writebol says his mother Nancy is making a remarkable recovery as she is treated for Ebola at Emory University Hospital

Writebol is being treated at the hospital alongside Dr Kent Brantly, an American physician who also came down with Ebola in Liberia during the largest outbreak of the disease in history.

Ebola has killed nearly 1,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria in total.

The two Americans were the first to receive an experimental medicine called ZMapp, which doctors hope will help them fight the virus with a 90 per cent fatality rate.

Another missionary named Miguel Pajares, 75, was approved to take the medicine, but it is unclear if he was given a dose before his death after being flown back to his home country of Spain. It was announced Monday that doctors in Liberia will soon be receiving the experimental medication as well.

While Dr Brantly was able to walk into the hospital, Writebol was in worse condition when she arrived last week but she was still able to recognize her son when she saw him for the first time.

'There was a little crease of a smile that came up and we were both in tears,' Jeremy recalled. 'I was able just to say, "Mom I love you".

Quarantined: Nancy Writebol's husband David returned from Liberia Monday night and will have to spend approximately three weeks in quarantine before he can visit his wife

'It was very, very emotional just to see your mom there, in that way, for the first time, after thinking you might never see her again.'

Jeremy has also been able to see Dr Brantly at Emory, and he took the chance to thank him for giving his mother care while she was still in Liberia. The two exchanged thumbs up through a window at the ward.

'My mom has said this: "Jeremy you have a third brother now and it's Dr Brantly,"' Jeremy recalled.

One person who hasn't been able to visit Nancy yet though is her husband, who just returned from Liberia on Monday. 

David Writebol and other aid workers 
returning from the country are being quarantined for three weeks, to 
make sure none are infected.

SIM
 USA, the North Carolina-based organization that sent the Writebols to Liberia, is pulling 
missionaries from the country, but says none of their other aid workers are 
sick or have displayed symptoms of the highly-fatal virus.

During his Today show interview, Jeremy said his parents may return to Liberia if his mother recovers. 

'It won't be an easy decision for them but I wouldn't be surprised,' he said.

Shared passion: Jeremy Writebol says he wouldn't be surprised if his parents decide to return to aid work in Africa, if his mother recovers from Ebola
