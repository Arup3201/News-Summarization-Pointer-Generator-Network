Britain is rushing vital technical equipment to Australia after a major breakdown in the specialised vessels being used to search for the missing flight MH370.

The under-sea search vehicle known as Bluefin-21 and the high-tech ship Ocean Shield have suffered the same fate as the missing Malaysian Airlines jet - a failure by their transponders to communicate with one another.

The transponders on the Bluefin and the Ocean Shield have to be able to communicate as they respectively search the bed of the Indian Ocean and the surface.

It came as Malaysia, China and Australia all agreed to re-examine all data related to missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to better pinpoint the search area.

Shooting blanks: The US navy's Bluefin-21 has been searching for MH370 with faulty hardware, it was revealed on Thursday

Malaysia's
 acting transport minister said the three countries also agreed at a 
meeting in Canberra last week to undertake a survey to map the ocean 
floor and procure more deep-sea search vehicles and other equipment to 
scour it.

Minister
 Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur: 'I have briefed 
the Malaysia cabinet yesterday on the outcome of the meeting and it has 
been deliberated.

'I now 
have the mandate to announce that the details of the transition phase 
have been approved by the Malaysian government,' he said.

The Australian government has already been forced into an embarrassing admission that
 equipment used in the mammoth hunt for the wreckage of flight MH370 has
 been plagued by technical defects.

The Boeing 777 disappeared from tracking systems 68 days ago, costing authorities around the world hundreds of millions of dollars.

In
 a statement released on Thursday by the Joint Agency Coordination 
Centre, a federal government initiative set up specifically for the 
MH370 search, it was announced that some of the tracking gear on defence
 ship ADV Ocean Shield was flawed.

Frustrating delay: ADV Ocean Shield can't redeploy its submersible until spare parts arrive from the UK

Location: The Australian Transport Safety Bureau had been scrutinising photos of the object, which washed ashore six miles east of Augusta in Western Australia state

It
 comes as the Australian government dedicated $89.9 million in the 2014 
budget to continue the search for MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. 
The Government estimates that it will have spent $10million already by 
June 30 this year, according to Australian Aviation.

'Examination
 of the communications problem has established that a hardware defect 
exists in the transponder mounted on the Ocean Shield and that a defect 
may also exist in the transponder mounted on the Bluefin-21. This 
inhibits the ability of the two devices to communicate with each other,'
 the statement read.

Bluefin-21
 is a submersible vessel scouring the seabed off Western Australia for 
any sign of the aircraft at the centre of one of aviation's most 
perplexing mysteries.

Faulty: The Bluefin-21 was damaged after colliding with a transponder on its mother ship

The
 realisation at this point in the search process will add further 
frustration and delay to the plights of the familes of 239 people on 
board the flight who remain totally unaccounted for.

'Spare
 parts for both defects will be dispatched from the United Kingdom. The 
parts are expected to arrive in Western Australia on Sunday.

'Ocean
 Shield is currently en route to Dampier, Western Australia, to receive 
the transponder parts. The journey is anticipated to take a number of 
days. At this stage, Ocean Shield is expected go alongside so engineers 
can make a full assessment of the transponder repairs,' the statement 
read.

Bluefin-21
 was recently damaged while being hoisted back aboard the ADV Ocean 
Shield. It is believed 20-knot winds caused the equipment to crash into 
the side of the ship and collide with the transponder.

As a result the acoustic communication links between the two pieces of hardware malfunctioned.

The
 seemingly cursed search for MH370 now includes personnel from 
Australia, the People's Republic of China, Malaysia and the United 
States.

Operation headquarters recently relocated from Perth to Canberra.

The 21-foot-long autonomous 
underwater vehicle is designed for deep-sea surveying and is capable of 
staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling, scanning regions at a speed of two to three knots.

Shaped like a torpedo, it can operate 
almost up to three miles underneath the waves and is equipped with a 
variety of sonar and cameras that can search and map 40 square miles of sea floor per day.

It has only being deployed because it can not be used until a search 
area is narrowed down. Bluefin 21 has a depth rating of 4,500m, meaning 
it will be at its limit in the Indian Ocean search zone.

Searchers
 usually programme the propeller-driven vehicle with the coordinates for
 a back-and-forth search that has been compared to mowing a lawn.

First, the vehicle will survey the area with side-scan sonar.

The sonar readings are stored in the robot's removable memory, and retrieved once the sub comes back up to the surface.

If
 the sonar scan turns up objects of interest, the Bluefin 21 would be 
refitted with high-resolution cameras for a visual survey.

The robot would have to dive closer to the seafloor for a concentrated survey of the target area.

When the imagery is brought back up, it would be analysed to see if there is any sign of the blackbox.

One
 of the Bluefin 21's most recent claims to fame was its role in the 
search for wreckage from Amelia Earhart's airplane, which disappeared in
 the Pacific in 1937.

Bluefin Robotics says its AUV can also be used for archaeology, oceanography, mine countermeasures, and unexploded ordinance.
