Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism squad has arrested a 33-year-old man accused of links to terrorist activity in Syria.

Two addresses in west London linked to the unnamed suspect have also been searched by Metropolitan Police detectives.

The man was arrested on suspicion of assisting committing acts of terrorism and on suspicion of funding terrorism.

He is being held at a south London police station, a Met spokesman said.

He added: 'The enquiries relate to an investigation into suspected terrorist activity in Syria'.

A series of arrests have been made in recent months of suspects either travelling back from war-torn Syria, trying to reach the country from the UK or attempting to send funds for terrorism there. 

In the  18 months to June this year there were 65 arrests linked to Syria but more than 40 came in 2014. 

Hundreds of would-be British jihadists have gone to the war-torn Middle Eastern state to join fighting there, and UK authorities recently launched a campaign to encourage Muslim women to inform on relatives they suspect of planning to travel there. 

The typical route for would-be jihadis is to fly to Turkey and then travel overland to Syria.

UK authorities have warned of the dangers of going to the Middle Eastern state, with a controversial campaign aimed at encouraging female relatives of aspiring terrorists to contact police. 

It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad. 

People convicted of fighting in Syria could face life in prison and going to an ISIS training camp carries a sentence of 10 years in prison.
