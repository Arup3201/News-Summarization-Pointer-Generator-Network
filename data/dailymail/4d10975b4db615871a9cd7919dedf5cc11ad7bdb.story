A teenage boy who survived being buried alive on a California beach for half an hour has said he 'thought he was going to die'.

Dozens of holidaymakers pitched in to try to dig out 17-year-old Matt Mina, who was stuck seven foot deep after a tunnel he had been digging in the sand collapsed, trapping him.

Despite the desperate efforts to free the trapped sand kept pouring back into the huge hole.

Eventually firefighters managed to drag him out and although he was unconscious at first he has since made a remarkable recovery.

'I was falling in and out [of consciousness]. I thought I was going to die.

'I want to thank everyone... that helped me stay alive. I wanted to give a shout out to them and say thank you.'

When asked if his digging days are now over, Mina added: 'For now, definitely.'

Mina is in a good condition today after the horrific accident on Newport Beach at about 3.40pm yesterday.

Authorities said the boy had dug between five to seven feet below the surface of the beach when the surrounding sand caved in on him. 

He remained buried for almost 30 minutes while paramedics dug him out.

authorities eventually succeeded in rescuing him, the crowd erupted in 
cheers while the boy was rushed to Hoag Hospital in Orange County.

Police said Mina had been digging tunnels with friends several feet under the surface of the beach.

They tried to make the tunnels meet before the sand toppled on top of one of them.

The alarm was raised when a family member called a lifeguard for help.

Mina spoke today of his terrifying 
ordeal under ground, explaining how he screamed for help although he 
knew no one could hear him.

The 17-year-old said he managed to 
stay alive by moving his head from side to side to create an air bubble.
his hands were trapped behind him by the weight of the sand.

Mr Mina's mother said thank you to those who had chipped in to save her son.

'I just want everyone to know from the bottom of my heart how grateful we are that he's alive,' Melissa Mina, from Free Union, said.

'If it weren't for the bystanders, they wouldn't have gotten him out. ... I wish could go out there and hug everyone there that was digging.'

Melissa Mina said she got a call from her sister-in-law Wednesday evening while Matt Mina was in a hospital emergency room.

She said she wasn't aware of how big the hole was until she saw it on TV.

'When I finally spoke to Matt last night I asked, "How does it feel to be buried alive?" He said: "Different, mom. You have no idea how heavy the sand was",' she said.

The accident happened while Matt was visiting an aunt and uncle.

'I said when he left I was sending guardian angels to protect him,' the teen's mother said.

She said her son grew up in Hawaii for a time and had dug in sand previously.

'What would possess kids to do this? I hope they realise that this is dangerous to do,' she added.

Newport Beach resident Skip Snead told the Orange County Register about 40 people were digging frantically to save the boy.

'Everybody was thinking, "They're going to pull up a dead body,"' he said.

He described the moment Mina was dragged out alive. 'Everyone went crazy,' he said. 'I think he was in shock.'

Fire officials have since warned parents not to let their children dig deep at the beach because the sand is unstable.

Authorities said teens building tunnels at the beach have caused many injuries this summer alone across the country.  In one case near Watsonville, a boy trapped under the sand suffered brain damage.

'This gentleman [Mina] was about seven feet below the surface of the sand,' Newport Beach Fire Department Battalion Chief Jeff Boyles told KTLA News. 'He was doing what we call tunneling, which is a very dangerous operation. The sand collapsed on him, essentially burying him alive.'

Chief Boyles added that such incidents have a 'high fatality rate'.

'The fact that he's still alive today - I think he has a lot to be owed to luck, and to the great efforts of the lifeguards and fire personnel that dug him out.'
