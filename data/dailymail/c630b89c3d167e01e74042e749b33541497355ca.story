A woman rescued a dog on Saturday after its owner posted an ad on Craigslist threatening to shoot the dog if no one took it.

Liz Pendleton, of University City, Missouri, was browsing Craigslist when she came across a shocking ad titled: 'Dog needs gone or shot.'

The veterinary student clicked on the ad and read that the ad poster 'had no use for a dog' and that if the dog wasn't gone by the end of the day, it would be shot.

Close call: On Saturday Buck's picture was posted on Craigslist along with a message that he would be shot if no one came to get him by the end of the day

Heartless: The owner of the dog didn't mince any words about what his fate would be if someone didn't come to his aid

Horrified: Liz Pendleton, seen here with Buck, jumped in her car and drove interstate to pick up the unwanted dog

Pendleton, who can't provide a permanent home for a large animal right now, nonetheless jumped in her car and drove an hour and a half to a Morrisonville, Illinois home to pick up the dog.

'It was an hour and a half, and the lady basically didnâ€™t say anything,' she told Fox2Now.

'There was no question I was going to get that dog.'

When Pendleton first patted the dog, 
who is about four years old, she said she could feel his ribs sticking 
out beneath his fur.

She has named the German shepherd mix Buck and says he's in need of a lot of love.

'He deserves love and much more than he has been getting,' she said.

Needs a home: Pendleton says Buck is a 'good boy' who needs a lot of love, which he's clearly been denied in his life so far

Pendleton told Fox2Now that she has contacted the police in relation to the Craigslist ad but it's unclear if any charges will be laid in the matter.

The animal lover is now looking for someone to adopt Buck and give him the home he deserves.

Pendleton has set up an email address, lizzy314314@gmail.com, where anyone interested in providing a home for Buck can contact her.
