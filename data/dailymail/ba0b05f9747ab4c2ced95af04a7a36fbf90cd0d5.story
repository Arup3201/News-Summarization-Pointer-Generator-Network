A St. Louis County woman is denying she posted a claim on Twitter that a member of a grand jury told her the panel lacked evidence to prosecute the Ferguson police officer who killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Thursday that Susan M. Nichols of Affton claims her Twitter account was hacked.

A tweet posted Wednesday under Nichols' name - but was quickly deleted - suggested that a friend serving on the grand jury reviewing Brown's shooting said the panel lacked evidence to warrant criminal charges against the officer, Darren Wilson.

Nichols told the newspaper she had 'talked to the authorities' about the matter.

Under investigation for misconduct: This Tweet, posted Wednesday by Susan M Nichols but quickly deleted, suggests that a member of the grand jury investigating the shooting of Michael Brown has been discussing the case. However on Thursday Nichols claimed her account had been hacked and she did not post the message

Shooter: The trial started just days after the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown by St. Louis officer Darren Wilson (pictured) and will decide whether Wilson is to face any charges over the incident

County prosecutors said Wednesday they were reviewing the report.

A spokesman for Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch could not be reached for comment Thursday by The Associated Press, and Nichols declined to comment.

The grand jury trail started on August 20, just days after the shooting of 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed - and is confidential.

The St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office has since confirmed it is 'looking into' the alleged breach, according to The Washington Post.

A leak could force the trial to restart.

A restart would require a full new jury panel.

The possible leak was made public by Shaun King, who has been a vocal activist in the Brown case, according to Mashable.

King noticed that a woman, Susan M. Nichols, had posted information about the trial on her Twitter handle @thesusannichols.

The handle has now been deleted, but King made a screenshot.

Nichols has also been vocal about the case and her support for Darren Wilson.

She allegedly Tweeted: 'I know someone sitting on the grand jury of this case There isn't enough at this point to warrant an arrest. #Ferguson.'
