Families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing are still angry with the Scottish and British government over the release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, a leading senator said yesterday after the terrorist's death.

‘This man was a horrible man,' said New York's Chuck Schumer. 'It would have been better if he’d not died in freedom but died in prison. That’s what he deserved.

‘I still believe that the Scottish government, perhaps with the participation of the British government, created a major injustice when they let him out.’

Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Al-Megrahi (above in 2009) was convicted of being the evil mastermind behind the 1988 plane explosion that killed 270 people

Asked if we will ever know what happened in the bombing, he said: ‘Both the Scottish and British governments have not been forthcoming.

‘The whole deal smelled of a trade for oil for this man’s freedom and that was almost blasphemy given the terrible destruction he caused.

‘I don’t know if we’ll ever get to the bottom of it now’.

Frank Duggan, president of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which represent the US families who lost loved ones in the disaster, said: ‘Megrahi was shameless, he was unrepentant and chose to go to his death claiming that he had nothing to do with the bombing, which was unbelieveable.

Megrahi was the only person convicted in 2001 of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 as it flew to New York from London

All 259 people aboard the airliner died and 11 others in the town of Lockerbie were killed by falling wreckage

‘I would not want to go to my maker with that on my conscience, but he has chosen to.

‘He should have died in Scotland and there is a still a lot of resentment at what the Scottish government did - it just boiled the blood of the relatives who lost loved ones.

‘I think we all hope that now we can finally get to the bottom of what really happened’.

Eileen Monetti, who lost her 20-year-old son Rick in the Lockerbie bombing, said: ‘I feel nothing at the news, just nothing.

‘Megrahi was a distraction that stopped us from finding out the truth.

‘Now that Megrahi has died hopefully the Libyan government will give more information to the US and the UK about the bombing.

‘It’s now up to a higher power to judge him for his crimes’.

Bert Ammerman, who lost his brother in the bombing, said it had been a ‘24-year struggled for the families’.

He said: ‘I firmly believe that Iran and Syria were involved in this also.....they should be pursued along with the others who did this despicable act.’

Eileen Walsh, who lost her brother, father and sister in the bombing, said she still had not forgiven the British and Scottish governments for their role in releasing Megrahi.

Speaking from her home in Glen Rock, New Jersey, she said: ‘Good riddance to him and I hope he rots in hell.

‘I have no feelings apart from anger and disgust for this man. The fact that he was allowed to be with his family while he took two-and-a-half years to die makes me ill.

‘Because of him my mother died of cancer without most of her family around to comfort her.

‘I feel so betrayed by the Scottish government for what they did, and the British government played its part too. He should have died in jail.’
