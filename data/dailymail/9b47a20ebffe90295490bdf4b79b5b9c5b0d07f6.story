A southern Kentucky man who was arrested on charges of shoplifting and public intoxication has got himself into more trouble by pulling a prank that police say was not very funny.

Officers in Corbin arrested 29-year-old Michael Harp on Tuesday afternoon but have since added three extra counts to his name.

Harp managed to get his phone into the holding cell, where he placed to sober up.

Not long after a delivery from Domino's arrived at the police station, with five pizzas under the name of Officer Wilson, the same officer that arrested Harp.

Scene: Harp, 29, was behind bars at Corbin Police Station when he called in the pies, officials said

The officers were able to trace the call and realized Harp was in possession of his phone.

Not impressed, police subsequently charged Harp with theft of identity, theft by deception and impersonating a police officer.

However, in an interview with local station WKYT, Harp denied having anything to do with the pizza prank.

'I'm wrongfully accused on this here,' he said.

'There was about 10 people (in the cell) who probably used the phone, so it's hard to say.

'Like I said, I never heard anyone say a word about Domino's pizzas. Any of it.'

Harp said he intends to get a lawyer and fight the additional charges.

'I guess take it to court and see what happens,' he said.

'There's not much I can do at the current moment.

'Iâ€™m not the guilty one on this.'

Harp did not have an attorney listed on his police report.

Harp was expected to make bail by the weekend.

A preliminary hearing has not yet been set.

Corbin is about 87 miles south of Lexington.
