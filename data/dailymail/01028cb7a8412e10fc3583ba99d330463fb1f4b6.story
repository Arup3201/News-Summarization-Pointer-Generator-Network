Shafilea Ahmed's decomposed remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004 and her parents are now on trial for her murder

A second sister of Shafilea Ahmed wrote an account of the teenager being murdered by their strict Muslim parents, a court heard yesterday.

But Mevish Ahmed, 21, told the jury that the scenes she described were works of fiction and insisted the couple had not killed her.

The trial of Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his wife Farzana, 49, has already heard from their second child, Alesha, that they hit Shafilea and then suffocated her with a plastic bag in front of the other children.

The alleged attack, said to have happened in 2003 when Shafilea was 17, began after a row over a revealing outfit she wore to her part-time job and followed months of clashes over her lifestyle, Alesha claimed.

Yesterday the jury was told that since the case began last month, police had been given diary entries and letters written by the Ahmeds’ third daughter.

Mevish, who was 12 at the time of Shafilea’s disappearance, has accompanied her parents into court along with her younger brother, Junyade.

The accounts were written by Mevish in 2008 and given to a friend, Shahin Munir, Chester Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Andrew Edis suggested that if the documents had a title, it would be: ‘How my parents killed my sister.’

In one extract, Mevish says: ‘Three times she ran but they got her.’

A second extract read to the court included the sentences: ‘She didn’t do nothing. Shouting, time after time. What did she do?

‘That’s it, space of one to two minutes – gone.’

Alesha, the chief prosecution witness, has told the jury that Shafilea repeatedly ran away from home to escape the violence she claims their parents meted out.

She also told how in September 2003 
her parents pushed Shafilea on to the settee in their house in 
Warrington, Cheshire. The couple then forced a plastic bag into the 
teenager’s mouth and suffocated her in front of the other children, she 
said.

Alesha told of watching the couple 
sorting through bin bags and rolls of tape after the alleged killing – 
before seeing her father leave the house carrying a dark package.

Mr Edis suggested to Mevish that her writings ‘look like an allegation of murder against your parents’.

But she replied: ‘No, it is not based on me or my family. It is just chat – just random stuff.’

She also described her writings as ‘just a story’ and added: ‘I used the names but that doesn’t mean it is about us.’

Mevish met Miss Munir in a park in 
August 2008 – when she had a drug problem – the court heard. Miss Munir 
wrote a record of what she said Mevish told her. This was read to the 
jury. It began: ‘They sat her down in a chair and her Dad went mad.

‘He started proper hitting her. Mevish tried to stop it but her Mum pushed her away.

‘They used the plastic bag to suffocate her and one or two minutes, she was gone.’

Mevish insisted to the court the account was fiction or ‘free writing’.

She admitted asking Miss Munir to return the documents but said her friend had kept photocopies.

Earlier she denied witnessing her parents killing her sister.

On May 24, Miss Munir told Miss Ahmed in a text she ‘just wanted to do the right thing’.

Miss Ahmed replied: ‘And you are doing. It’s not like you’re lying.’

Mr Edis accused the witness of trying 
to ‘suppress the truth’ and she replied: ‘It’s nothing to do with a 
cover-up. I’m not saying that at all.’

In a further exchange that day, Miss 
Munir said: ‘You know what, Mev, if I didn’t care about you I wouldn’t 
have given it a second thought and have done it.’

On May 29 Miss Munir sent a text to Miss Ahmed saying: ‘Please, please ring me, okay please.’

A second text which followed said: ‘I’m sorry okay, really, really sorry.’

Mr Edis said that was the first contact between the pair after Miss Munir spoke to police.

She was interviewed by officers that afternoon but did not sign the witness statement, the court heard.

There followed four phone calls between them totalling 74 minutes.

Questioned about that conversation, 
Miss Ahmed said: ‘I’m not going to say I can remember the full 
conversation because I can’t.’

Mr Edis said: ‘Most people would be able to give the jury an account of a conversation which was as recent as this.’

She replied: ‘She kept saying she was sorry. She was upset, she said she had given the police my writing.’

The barrister asked Miss Ahmed for her response, to which she said: ‘Nothing really.

‘It wasn’t my concern.’

Mr Edis said: ‘She must have done something.’

The following day, Miss Ahmed said in a text to her friend: ‘Well, you need to go and tell them that you lied.’

Miss Munir replied: ‘I can’t get done for it.’

Miss Ahmed responded: ‘Not really. If you had signed, yes you could. But you didn’t.’

Later, Miss Munir told Miss Ahmed: ‘I can’t go back on it.’

Later the court was told about a 
conversation between the two friends in December 2008 in which the 
prosecution say Miss Ahmed told Miss Munir about the ‘humiliation’ she 
would suffer at the hands of her mother when she was angry.

Mr Edis said she was ‘very 
embarrassed’ about it and said she told her friend how she was taken 
into a room and the door was locked.

Mr Edis said: ‘You used to keep your 
eyes closed because you didn’t want it to happen and your mother would 
humiliate you to teach you a lesson... you told Shahin that she used to 
touch you in places where you did not want to be touched.’

He said she was also verbally abused at the same time.

Miss Ahmed responded: ‘No. My mother 
never touched me in places I didn’t want to be touched. My mother didn’t
 verbally abuse me.’

She said her mother would just shout at her when she was angry.

Mr Edis added: ‘You saw your mother and father kill your sister.’

She responded: ‘No. I didn’t, no.’

Shafilea was murdered because her 
parents believed her ‘Westernised’ lifestyle was bringing shame on the 
family, the prosecution say.

Her remains were found in Cumbria in 
February 2004, but it was not until 2010 that Alesha gave her account to
 the police. Mr and Mrs Ahmed deny murder.

The jury was sent home and the trial will resume tomorrow at 10am.
