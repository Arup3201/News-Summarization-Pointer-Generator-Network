Jailed:  David Geddes, 49, stabbed his son, David Jr, 23,  in the chest after a family row at their home in Nelson, Lancashire

A jobless alcoholic father-of-14 stabbed his son and left him to bleed on the kitchen floor as he washed and hid the blade - before asking  'I didn't see a knife - did you?'.

David Geddes, 49, who drinks 20 pints of beer a day, stabbed David Jr in the chest during a family row.

The argument began after he accused his son of bringing home a male friend said to have had an affair with one of Geddes' former partners.

After the attack, Geddes smiled as the victim lay begging for help - ignoring his pleas as he washed the knife and put it back in the kitchen drawer.

Paramedics eventually arrived at the bloody scene in Nelson, Lancashire, and rushed David Jr to hospital.

The victim, 23, lost nearly two litres of blood and suffered severe damage to his liver and lung requiring life-saving surgery, with medics cutting open his back to repair the internal injuries.

In his impact statement read at Burnley Crown Court, David Jr said: 'A father should not do that to his son and I don't want to have anything to do with him again.'

Geddes, who fathered his brood of children with five different women over 25 years, would normally consume a staggering 300 units of alcohol per week - the equivalent of 150 pints of beer.

After being arrested over the incident, which took place last December, Geddes laughed during a police interview when officers suggested he had stabbed his son.

Passing sentence, Judge Ian Leeming, QC, told Geddes : 'Very sadly, your victim was your son. Words fail me. This was appalling behaviour of an extreme nature. 

'The victim cannot comprehend how a father could do to his son what you have done to him.' 

During the trial, a witness said Geddes was 'acting strangely, like he was someone else and was out of control.' 

He kicked and punched his son and pushed away the victim's girlfriend when the trouble spilled outside the front door.

Geddes then followed his son back inside the property, walked towards him and stabbed him. 

With the scene soaked in blood, Geddes went about hiding the blade before asking the witness: 'I didn't see a knife. Did you?' 

Prosecutor Michael Maher said: 'The defendant went inside. His son was haemorrhaging and was banging on the window, asking his father to call an ambulance. 

'A witness states he refused. He did call 999, alleged his son had threatened him with a knife and then he hung up.'

In the months after after the attack Geddes admitted himself to be treated for his heavy drinking, where he made 'chilling' remarks about his ex-partner - threatening to inject her with unknown substances and use battery acid to maim.

David Jr suffered a wound to his right chest wall and injury to his diaphragmatic muscle and a right artery, which bled so profusely it had to be secured at both ends with surgical clips.

Speaking about the effect the incident had on the victim, Mr Maher continued: 'He says he had to take pain killers for six or seven weeks. 

'He couldn't sleep because of pain and he was regularly having nightmares. The incident has disfigured him and affected him emotionally.'

Geddes was found not guilty of intending to do grievous bodily harm and was jailed for just 33 months.

He was also made subject to a permanent restraining order, banning him from contacting his son and other members of his family.

In mitigation, Geddes' counsel, Rick Holland, said: 'This is both a serious and depressing case, involving, as it does, father and son. 

'David Geddes is very much a different character to that person who offended and indeed that person who is reported to have made those threats.

'He does have a deep sense of regret, that his own flesh and blood suffered as a part of this incident.'

After the case, a neighbour said: 'No one has a good word to say about him. He's just a layabout.

'For a dad to treat a son like that, where's the respect? Where's any family morals? Obviously none in that household.'
