Locked up: John Reed, 65, the mastermind behind a drug smuggling gang which brought tens of millions of pounds worth of high-purity cocaine into the UK hidden in lorries, was jailed for 28 years today

The mastermind behind a drug smuggling gang which brought tens of millions of pounds worth of high-purity cocaine into the UK hidden in lorries was jailed for 28 years today.

John Reed, 65, led the group which imported hundreds of kilograms of the Class A drug into Britain from the Netherlands over the space of at least 18 months, Kingston Crown Court heard.

The convicted armed robber and four members of the gang were arrested in January last year when police found 24lb (11kg) of cocaine with an estimated street value of £1.5 million in a raid on a haulage firm.

The Metropolitan Police have said they believe the gang was making £25 million per year.

Reed and minor gang member Kevin Jones, 51, were jailed at Kingston Crown Court today for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs in what Judge Nicholas Price QC called 'an extensive and highly lucrative conspiracy' over at least 18 months.

'This conspiracy was so long-running and concerned so many kilograms of cocaine it was truly off the scale,' he said.

'It is important that you and the general public understand why the courts have consistently adopted an uncompromising stance in relation to sentencing for Class A drugs.

'It has become a scourge on society.'

He told Reed he was satisfied he was the main player and financier of the scheme, which only ended because they got caught.

'It was always the prosecution case that you were the principal leader of the conspiracy at the London end,' the judge added.

'I’m satisfied that you were the mastermind behind this long-running and highly lucrative conspiracy.'

Reed, of Southwark, London, led the gang with haulier Daniel Cheevers, the court heard, using Cheevers’s Northamptonshire business as cover for taking money to the continent and bringing back up to 11kg of the drug at a time.

The court heard that significant amounts of money had been deposited in bank accounts in Dubai. A further £24,000 in cash was found at his home when it was raided by police.

The gang brought back on average 7.5kg of uncut cocaine on each trip, the court heard.

The drug was at 92 per cent purity and worth up to £70,000 per kilo. It would be worth more when it was cut down to a street strength of below 20 per cent purity.

Prosecutor Mark Gadsden said that the group used two drivers to make multiple trips and bring up to 300kg of the drug back every year.

'These two defendants, with the others, were party to a conspiracy to import and distribute multi-kilogram consignments of very high purity cocaine,' he said.

'These consignments being imported from mainland Europe in transcontinental lorries were then distributed across London and the south east of England.'

Reed’s barrister Ian Winter QC claimed there was no evidence that his client had played any more than a minor role in the drug smuggling but the judge rejected his argument.

Reed and Jones remained impassive in the
dock throughout proceedings. Both nodded and silently mouthed their 
thanks to the judge as they were led down.

The court heard Reed was previously jailed for 17 years in 1987 for his role in an armed robbery in London in which police officers were shot at.

Armed police were on guard in and outside the court building today as the sentence was passed.

Former lorry driver Jones, of Welling, Kent, acted in an 'important role' as a go-between and messenger with the gang while on day or night release from a seven-year prison sentence for drug smuggling, the judge said.

He was jailed for 15 years.

Cheevers, 47, of  Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was jailed for 25 years last month. He was also the former team manager of the Pr1mo Kawasaki Superbike team.

Two other members of the gang - Joseph McCorry, 52, of  Welling, and Robert Greenhill, 62, of Dartford, Kent - were jailed for 19 and 12 years respectively at the same time.

All had denied conspiracy to supply cocaine but were found guilty at an earlier trial.

Scotland Yard has also issued an appeal to trace three others who are still on the run.

Jamie Spring, 40, also known as Jamie Hall, Christopher Mealey, 37, and Lee Smith, 40, have not been seen since the other gang members were arrested.

Spring and Mealey are the sons-in-law of Reed and, along with Smith, have connections to Spain and Cyprus but police said this week they 'retain an open mind' as to their whereabouts.
