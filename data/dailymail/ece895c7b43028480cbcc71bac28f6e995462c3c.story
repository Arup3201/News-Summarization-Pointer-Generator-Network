It's a piece of jewellery that symbolises a historic victory for one of NRL's most beloved teams.

But the rare, custom made 2014 South Sydney Rabbitohs premiership ring has stumped Northern Territory police after it was found amidst a drug raid.

Officers who conducted a search of suspected Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle gang member Anthony Orrell's home near Darwin last month, allege they found the ring alongside various illegal drugs.

The 31-year-old is understood to have denied that the ring was stolen and his lawyer told the Darwin Magistrates Court on Thursday that he would not be commenting on its origin, the ABC reports. 

Only 73 of the $8,000 2014 South Sydney Rabbitohs premiership rings were produced, 20 of which were presented to the team and its officials while club owner Russell Crowe bought the other 53, the ABC reports.

A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that detectives had been in contact with NRL officials and the club to try and track down the owner of the ring.

The NRL Integrity Unit is understood to have reported that all of the rings have been accounted for after the police request  was put forward, according to News Corp.

Police allege they found him in the possession of a trafficable amount of methamphetamine, MDMA and steroids as well as a non-trafficable amount of cannabis in Mr Orrell's (pictured) home

Police have been left stumped as to who the owner of the ring is. Mr Orrell has denied that the ring was stolen and his lawyer told the Darwin Magistrates Court on Thursday that he would not be commenting on its origin

'NT Police do not know who the ring belongs to or how it came to be in Darwin and are keen to return the ring to its owner who may be unaware even that the ring is missing,' police have said.

One ring was reported missing after being lost in Sydney Harbour by player Dylan Walker, however a statement from police said, 'NT Police and their NSW counterparts are satisfied with the explanation given by the owner of that ring'.

Mr Orwell plans to plead guilty to three charges relating to steroids, but will contest five other charges, according to the ABC.

Twenty of the $8,000 2014 South Sydney Rabbitohs premiership rings that were produced were presented to the team and its officials

Club owner Russell Crowe bought the remainder, however only one has been reported missing and police have said they 'are satisfied with the explanation given by the owner of that ring'

Police allege they found him in the possession of a trafficable amount of methamphetamine, MDMA and steroids as well as a non-trafficable amount of cannabis. 

His housemate, 26-year-old former model Asher De Rouffignac, will also fight the charges. She was also found in possession of a trafficable amount of methamphetamines.

‘All up 26.6 grams of methamphetamines, 11 grams of cannabis and 43mls of steroids were seized,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.
