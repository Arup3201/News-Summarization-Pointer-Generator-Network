Lorna Clymo, who suffered with depression, jumped to her death from a multi-storey car park after calls  to NHS out-of-hours numbers went unanswered

A mother-of-one who suffered suicidal bouts of depression jumped  to her death from a multi-storey car park after calls by her desperate family to NHS out-of-hours numbers went unanswered.

Lorna Clymo, 42, from Haworth, Keighley, suffered so badly from depression her partner, Mark Feather, was given a list of telephone helpline numbers for doctors to call in case she had depressive episodes after her discharge from hospital.

But although she was rated by health professionals as being at 'red' - at high risk of harming herself - Mr Feather found all the numbers rang out and he was unable to leave a message when he tried to contact them.

On February 1 last year Ms Clymo, a homecare worker, drove her Peugeot to the top of a car park in Keighley, near Bradford, and jumped.

She died a short time later in hospital from chest, spinal and pelvic injuries. 

Her anti depressants had been switched by doctors in the run up to her death.

At an inquest Ms Clymo's family condemned Bradford District Care Trust over its failure to have a messaging service and claimed she was not on the correct medication.

Her sister Sharon Charlton, 44, told Bradford Coroner's Court: 'If you are providing a service and somebody said 'just ring us up' and there was no message how would you know who was ringing you?

'If someone crying for help - you wouldn't know. The number you gave, there was no answer. 

'For somebody high risk, there was no support. 

'Lorna was agitated and we were getting agitated because nobody was there.

'You are professionals. You should have already had that in place. I am just thinking about it to make it safer. 

'To me her mood was down but she tried to act normally as if everything as okay.

'She was struggling and her mood just got low and I think the only people who could help her with the professionals.

'We were out of our depth because that is not what we do. 

'You go to professionals and hopefully you think they are going to look after her. I just do not think she was on the right medication.

'On the day she was sent home, even though she was high risk, she had to manage her own medication. She had to wean off one and increase another. 

'I feel as if she was neglected, a lack of care. 

'Why she was not sectioned? For somebody who tried two attempts in such a short space of time, why did you feel the need to let her go home? 

'The community nurses rang her but how can you see down a telephone?'

Earlier the Bradford hearing was told Ms Clymo had suffered from depression since 1998 but since September 2013 her condition deteriorated and she made two suicide attempts.

A month before her death she told Mr Feather she had taken dozens of pills and was rushed to hospital.

She was subsequently admitted to the Airedale Centre for Mental Health where she was kept as in-patient for a week - but she was still allowed out to visit friends and go home for period of time.

Just nine days after taking the pills, Ms Clymo attempted to hang herself and was readmitted again to the Heather ward and kept in from January 11 until the January 22, when her anti-depressant medication citalopram was changed to mirtazapine.

Engineer Mr Feather, 46, said in a statement: 'Since leaving the hospital she had more bad days than good days but still came across well to all of the mental health visitors. 

'I woke up on February 1 at 5am and Lorna got up with me. She had a coffee and said she felt fine.

'But the police came to my place of work just after 8.30am and I knew what had happened straight away. 

'I have been told a car was found at the top floor of the carpark and she had told me in the past she had driven there and thought about jumping off.'

Dr Andrew Aspin, a consultant psychiatrist for Bradford District Care Trust, said Ms Clymo's medication had been switched due to a deterioration in her condition, but that she was not mentally ill enough to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

He said: 'There was a risk, but toward the end of January Lorna was firmly saying she wanted to be out of hospital.

'She did have capacity - she was not suffering from confusion or memory loss which made her unable to understand the situation.

'There was no doubt she suffered from depression and a risk of harming herself, however parties felt the risk could be managed in the community in part because she was compliant with her treatment, she took her medication and was willing to sit down and talk with the intensive home treatment team.

'We also have a duty to use the least restrictive option. Lorna expressed the view that being in the hospital was detrimental for her. 

'She clearly and firmly said that she wanted to be home.

'I would say she did not have any immediate plans to harm herself but there remained a large concern about her depression and impulsivity. 

'The intensive home care treatment team grade or rate patients they are seeing according to how concerned they are.

'She was rated as a red which is the highest level of concern. But it was the opinion of doctors and nurses that the level of risk was not such that such immediate action be taken.'

Jackie Haw-Wells, who works for the Serious Incident Department told the inquest: 'Everybody felt there was a risk that she had had two previous suicide attempts and there was a concern but she would not have met the criteria.'

She said the lack of response from the out of hours hotline as an 'oversight' and an answer message service has been put in place. 

Recording a verdict of suicide Coroner Martin Fleming said: 'She did receive in that regard the best care from her doctors and they factored into the equation what they thought Lorna wanted.

'The family have raised concerns and certain issues and I am grateful the concerns have been acted open as far as the trust and hospital are concerned.'

After the hearing Mrs Charlton added: 'We left Lorna's care to the professionals and the outcome was fatal. 

'They are supposed to know what's best but at the end of the day my sister died even though she is high risk.

'Everything seems to stop on a Friday in adult health services. 

'When you have got an out of hour's number and somebody is supposedly on duty you expect to speak to someone and yet we could not do that. 

'Where are they all at these times? Do they not work Saturday and Sunday?'
