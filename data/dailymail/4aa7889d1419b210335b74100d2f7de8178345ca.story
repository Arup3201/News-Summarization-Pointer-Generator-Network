While the world was watching horrified as the baby Gammy scandal unfolded, two men in Australia were terrified the news would mean they may never get to see the faces of their unborn triplets.

Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were just three months away from meeting their beautiful triplet girls, via a Thai surrogate mother,  when a Perth couple reportedly abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand.

As the news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections. The couple, from Kinglake West in Victoria, were worried sick that this could mean the end of their dream of having a family.

Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were just three months away from meeting their beautiful triplet girls, via a Thai surrogate mother, when a Perth couple abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand 

After spending two years trying to father a child in Australia, the couple  decided Thailand was their best option of ever having a baby.

'We tried all other avenues like adoption, fostering, co-parenting but we weren't getting anywhere,' Peter told Daily Mail Australia.

'Then I stumbled actors an article about another gay couple In NSW who had done it through Thailand,' he said. 

The couple travelled to Thailand twice to check out the surrogacy process, talking to agents about the legalities of the contracts. They were then asked for a sperm donation and waited with bathed breath to hear the news they desperately craved.

After three failed IVF attempts, they were ready to throw in the towel. They were emotionally and financially exhausted but miraculously their fourth attempt worked and they were finally pregnant. 

'It was getting really hard,' Shannon told Daily Mail Australia.

Chloe, Maddison and Dior were born three-months ago via a surrogate mother 

'We went to work one day and said to each other: "have a think about it and when we came home if we both have the same answer we’ll do it again". We came home and we both had the same answer so we gave it one more shot and it worked,' he said. 

The couple had never planned on having triplets. Initially they were told they were having one baby, then two and then an email came into Shannon's work address stating 'triplets at nine weeks'. 

'I said to my boss "hold on a minute, I need to read what I just saw" and then I came home with the email and showed Peter', Shannon said.

'My jaw just dropped and then I laughed. I was happy I just thought wow, going from one to three’ Peter said. 

However, things took an unprecedented turn when their surrogate was six months pregnant. A Perth couple who had travelled to Thailand to bring home twins born via surrogate left the world reeling after they left their disabled son Gammy in Thailand.

Desperately searching for answers, Shannon and Peter spent three weeks trying in vain to contact their surrogate agency. After two years of trying to conceive, the men were adamant they would not lose their girls.

Internet whiz Shannon stumbled across a forum online for prospective surrogate parents. With over 500 members on the site it was a reassuring presence for the men, who would speak to people about what contact they had managed to make with Thai agencies. 

Their nerves grew as reports surfaced on the forum that some surrogate mothers were resorting to aborting their babies as they had not heard from the parents in weeks. 

As the weeks rolled on, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop stepped in. Posting on the forum, her government told the couples that she would speak to the Thai military.

Shannon said the Minister helped them with the exhausting process, ensuring they were allowed access into the country and negotiated with the Thai government. 

'She really helped us negotiate with the government and helped Australians in general' he said. 

'When they said we could go through, that was the best thing ever because it was just getting so messy', he said. 

There were talks that the Thai government would bring in court orders where couples would have to wait six months before they would be allowed to bring their children back to Australia.

Finally, Shannon and Peter got their hands on the number for their surrogate mother. She was equally as pleased to talk to the couple, having sent out a prayer over Facebook, hoping the men would find her.

With the help of their Thai friend, the couple managed to speak with her and she reassured them that their babies were still healthy and ready to meet their daddies. 

Three months later, their adorable baby girls Chloe, Maddison and Dior were born. After spending two months filling out streams of paperwork, Shannon and Peter were finally able to bring their babies home to Australia. 

Life at home would never be the same for Shannon and Peter. Jet-lagged and exhausted, the first-time parents didn't sleep for 24 hours. Their friends and family had told them that triplets would be challenging but the men didn't realise how demanding it would be. 

'We had no idea. People were warning us but we just thought it won’t be any different because we’ll just go straight into a triplet situation without stressing because we won’t know any better,' Shannon said. 

Now at 12-weeks-old the couple admit that being the parents to triplets is demanding but rewarding.

Peter works eight hour days while Shannon stays at home with the triplets for 16 hours while on maternity leave for six months. The pattern has been tough on the parents and they are hoping a volunteer can provide them with some relief

‘When they got home from Thailand we went 24 hours without sleep and we were just like zombies, nausea because of no sleep, no eating  and we were just looking at each,' Peter said.

'Its still hard because they're changing and when you want to sleep you just can’t get it,' he said. 

The parents admit that cooking a meal is out of the question when the girls are awake and they survive on just four hours sleep a night to get them through. 

'With mum being here I could do a bit of house work and feed the two little puppies, but in general it takes it’s toll.'

Peter returned to work a week after the triplets came home. His company offered him part-time work but he was unable to take them up on the offer, as the family would not be able to survive on a part-time wage financially.

Now he works eight hour days while Shannon stays at home with the triplets for 16 hours while on maternity leave for six months. The pattern has been tough on the parents and they are hoping a volunteer can provide them with some relief. 

The world watched on in horror as baby Gammy was left abandoned by his Australian parents

The Multiple Birth Volunteer Support Foundation has put the call out for volunteers to help the couple.   

'People are telling us that Shannon will never go back to work because the three girls are going to need him, so financially we've got to look at can we survive on one wage so if we can get help Shannon might be able to get back part-time,' Peter said.

The pair are looking for an experienced child minder, who will not be expected to take care of the triplets on their own. The girls need to be fed every three hours and feeding, changing and baby-related chores will be involved in the role.

'We're pretty much looking for someone who's experienced. If we had a volunteer that comes in and works with mum, then we could sleep', Peter said. 

When asked if they have plans to expand their family, both Shannon and Peter laugh, content with their three little ladies for the moment.
