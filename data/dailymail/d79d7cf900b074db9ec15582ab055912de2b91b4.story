Sad: Villagers attempted to join in the rescue effort but could not save the two adult female elephants and one calf which died at the scene. Another died later from its injuries

They were hit by the Mahananda Express Passenger train early today in 
Jalpaiguri district, nearly 400 miles east of Kolkata, the capital of 
West Bengal 
state.

The track, which connects Siliguri to Assam, was closed down for 
several hours after the collision, as other elephants were guarding the 
dead and injured animals.

Nearby villagers attempted to join in the rescue effort but could not save the two adult female elephants and one calf which died at the scene.

A crane was even needed to remove the carcass of one of the elephants.Â

Campaign: Activists have called for trains to lower their speeds through areas populated with elephants

Railway spokesman Jayant Sharma said the
 accident site was outside the state's elephant corridor and there was 
no warning from the forest department about the movement of the 
elephants.

Dozens of elephants have died in recent years in such accidents as trains run through national parks and forests. Activists have called for trains to lower their speeds through such areas.

India's wild elephant population was recently estimated at about 26,000.
