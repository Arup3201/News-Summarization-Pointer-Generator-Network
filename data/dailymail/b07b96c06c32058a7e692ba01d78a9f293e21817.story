Luiz Felipe Scolari apologised to the people of Brazil after they were humiliated 7-1 in the World Cup semi-final by Germany.

Brazil were 5-0 down at half-time after Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose, Toni Kroos (2) and Sami Khedira scored in a remarkable 18 minute spell.

Andre Schurrle added two more after the break and Brazilian forward Oscar responded in the final minute as the host nation were booed off the field.

This is Brazil’s first competitive defeat at home in 63 matches and their first on home soil since a loss to Peru in the Copa America in 1975.

Scolari, who insists he will not resign after this shameful defeat, said: ‘My message is, to the Brazilian people and fans, that we did and we tried to do what we could.

‘Please excuse us for this mistake. I’m sorry we couldn’t get to the final. This is a catastrophe.

‘It’s probably the worst moment of my career. This is the worst day of my life, but life goes on. 

‘I’ll be remembered probably because I lost 7-1, the worst defeat Brazil have ever had, but that was a risk I knew I was running when I accepted this position. Life goes on. That’s what I’ll do.

‘We did what we thought was our best, and we lost to a great team that had the team, in six or seven minutes, to end the game with three or four goals in extraordinary manner. 

‘I can tell you that, after the first goal, we had a problem and, with the skills of a team who have been working together for a long time, they capitalised on it.

‘We will continue working and honouring what our team means for the third place match in Brasilia. ‘I’d like to thank the supporters for supporting the players despite us losing by five, six, seven. It was interesting to see that happen.’

Scolari, who was without injured Neymar and suspended skipper Thiago Silva, took full responsibility for the manner of the defeat.

Brazil will now travel to Brasilia to play the loser of Wednesday evening’s semi-final in Sao Paulo between Argentina and Holland for the third and fourth place play-off.

He added: ‘Who is responsible when the team plays? Who is invited to be the coach? Who is responsible for picking the team? I am. It’s me. So the catastrophic result can be shared by the whole group. 

‘My players will tell you we will share our responsibilities. But who decided the tactics, I did. So the person responsible is me.

‘I don’t have any debt to the country. I did my job as I always have. I did what I thought was best. 

‘We had one defeat today. For a year and a half, this was a third defeat in 28 matches.

‘Yes, it was a terrible defeat in terms of the result, 7-1, but at 5-0, you try and rally to pull some goals back. 

‘That leaves you open to further disaster. In 2002, we won. Great. Now we’ve lost. But it was my choice. I made the choices. Me. Don’t forget there’s a match on Saturday, though. We can be third, so we still have a match to play.’ Stand-in captain David Luiz was in tears again at the final whistle and they were booed off the pitch when they turned to applaud the Brazil supporters.

Luiz said: ‘I wanted to give pleasure only for my people. All those who suffered so much, I want to apologise to every Brazilian.’

Scolari admitted he was powerless to re-organise his team after Klose became the World Cup’s all-time leading goalscorer with his 16th after 23 minutes.

Kroos struck twice before 26 minutes had been played and Khedira added the fifth after 29 minutes.

Scolari added: ‘No-one could change anything. It was one after the other. Everyone blanked out. 

‘We were trying to talk to them, to get re-organised and breathe for a second. But there was nothing we could do. Change one or two of them? We couldn’t do that when we were enduring the problem.’

Scolari also insisted that the absence of Neymar had nothing to do with the shambolic performance in the semi-final.

He added: ‘Let’s not try to find an excuse in Neymar or the emotions of the anthem. 

‘What happened was Germany imposed a fantastic rhythm on the game. They were able to score the goals to define the match. That diminished my team.’
