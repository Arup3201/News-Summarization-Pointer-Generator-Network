A flop sportscar has started a new life as a super pick-up truck that can go from nought to 60 in five seconds.

Two motor enthusiasts bought a 1989 Ferrari 412, usually regarded as one of the Italian car maker’s least desirable models, for £5,000 and then spent the next six weeks creating the first Ferrari pick-up truck.

London Motor Museum boss Elo and his mechanic friend Will Trickett removed a foot (30cm) of the roof and shifted everything forward to create a four-and-a-half feet load bed at the back.

They jacked up the rear suspension for extra load-carrying capability and taking inspiration from luxury yachts, they decided to use teak wood to panel the rear bed.

Elo has several dozen cars in his museum built the Ferrari for his History Channel TV series, Ultimate Wheels.

As well as the flat bed and suspension the two car fanatics swapped the Ferrari’s 4.9-litre V12 engine for a 5.7-litre V8 from a Chevrolet to give it more oomph.

‘The 412 is the most unloved Ferrari because it is when they tried to enter the saloon car market,’ revealed Elo. ‘They tried to make a car which was stylish and had an executive feel and it didn’t end up working out.

A painter and decorator's dream: The Ferrari may have been unloved as a sports car but it is ideal for a tradesman who can store his paint and ladders and make a quick getaway at 4pm - or even earlier

The bespoke sound system is another touch that makes the Ferrari pickup truck stand out from the crowd

‘When Will brought it back the first thing I saw was how angular it was and I thought I could make it into a pick-up.

‘We are really pleased with the results, it has turned out better than I thought and it is only at the second glance that you see it is a pick-up truck.

‘People are loving it, we’re getting so much interest in it and it is going to take pride of place in the London Motor Museum.'

The Ferrari also has a shotgun scoop bonnet and bespoke exhaust system resulting in a dual-personality of high performance hot-rod and practical workhorse.

This feature moves up and down and the unique exhaust has a valve system whereby the driver can decide at the flick of a switch whether to have the exhaust growl fiercely or produce a more refined sound for London’s leafier avenues.
