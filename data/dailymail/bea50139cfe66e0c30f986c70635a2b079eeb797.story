Hundreds of Korean War veterans marched through London today to mark 60 years since the 'Forgotten War'.

About 300 veterans marched from Horse Guards Parade in the capital to Westminster Abbey where a Service of Thanksgiving was being held to mark the war, which saw more than 1,000 British servicemen killed and 1,060 taken prisoner.

Some 100,000 British troops served on
the Korean peninsula as part of a United Nations force after the North 
Koreans invaded the South in June 1950.

An armistice was signed on July 27 
1953, but by that point more than 1,000 British servicemen had lost 
their lives and around 1,060 had been taken prisoner.

Nearly
the whole of the 1st Battalion The Gloucestershire Regiment - now part 
of The Rifles - were killed or taken prisoner during the Battle of the 
River Imjin in April 1951.

To mark the anniversary the veterans, led by the Royal Artillery Band, marched to Westminster Abbey for the service.

It was due to be attended by the Duke of Gloucester, Defence Minister Mark Francois, senior military representatives, and the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea.

Mr Francois, minister for defence personnel, welfare and veterans, said ahead of the service: 'Sixty years on the Korean War remains an international conflict in which Britain played a significant role and one that should never be forgotten.

'The commemorations to mark the 60th anniversary will, I hope, be a fitting way for the nation to give thanks to both the veterans, and those who paid the ultimate price in a bitterly fought campaign.'

The Korean War was between what we now know as south and north Korea.

It followed political division in Korea following the end of World War Two.

The Korean Peninsula was ruled by the Empire of Japan from 1910 until the conclusion of World War Two.

After
the surrender of the Empire of Japan in September 1945,Â  the peninsula 
was divided along the 38th parallel, with U.S. military forces occupying
the southern half and Soviet forces occupying the northern half.

However, the 38th parallel increasingly became a political border between the two Korean states.

Tension intensified and escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950.

A total of 100,000 British troops fought in the war, with more than 1,000 losing their lives.
