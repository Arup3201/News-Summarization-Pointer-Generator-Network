Long awaited summer holidays are here and they might not just bring relaxation and sun – they might bring you long-term love, too.

And if it doesn’t turn out to be the love of your life, don’t despair - there are high chances for some romantic fun.

More than one in four Britons (26 per cent) said they had a holiday romance or flirtatious experience with a stranger at least once during their life while on holiday, according to new statistics.

Love is in the air: More than one in four Britons said they had a holiday romance or flirtatious experience with a stranger at least once while on holiday

And some 11 per cent of them ended up getting married with that stranger, and still are, while four per cent said they met their former spouse on vacation, travel search site momondo has found.

Unsurprisingly, the majority of Britons (64 per cent) feel happier and more positive when they are not working and lying on a beach somewhere and 24 per cent become more social too, upping their chances of meeting someone.

Increased sociability even translates to the bedroom for some, with many Brits stating they have an increased desire for sex on holiday. And this goes for 19 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women.

‘When people go off on their holidays they often turn off “work mode” and start enjoying life – smiling more, being more adventurous and generally feeling happy. When people are happy on the inside, they project this outwardly and, in return people are attracted to them.

Not just a flirt: Some 11 per cent of those who had a holiday romance ended up married - and still are - momondo said

'It’s no wonder more and more people are finding romance on holiday – it’s when we are at our best and projecting the very best image of ourselves,’ says romance expert Tiffany Wright.

Romance or not, meeting new people while travelling is the essential ingredient for a good holiday for 23 per cent of Brits, the survey of 1,000 people has found.

‘Many single people who head on holiday do so in the hope they might have their "Shirley Valentine" moment and find the love of their lives.  Perhaps they start to dress more attractively? After all, everyone knows how romantic and exciting a holiday romance can be? And what better place to find love than in paradise?’ says Wright.

And after months of hard work, nearly half of Britons say they feel a holiday is good for their health.

Spokesperson at momondo, Julie Pedersen, said it is important for many Brits to relax whilst away, and as a result meeting new people can play a significant role.

‘When we book a trip to another country, we automatically open our minds to new experiences. These may come by visiting different places, or indeed via meeting new people, within these places.

‘Free from the humdrum of life back home, we take more time to savour the moment on holiday, drinking in the destination, and chatting to fellow travellers or locals alike. It fits then, that romantic encounters may follow if both parties are in the mood! These can form great holiday memories or even for some long-term partnerships.’
