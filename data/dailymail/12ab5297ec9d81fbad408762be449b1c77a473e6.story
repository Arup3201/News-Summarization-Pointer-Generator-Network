A black Labrador is recovering after she was shot up to 100 times with a BB gun.

Lady was found wandering around Waldoboro, Maine, two weeks ago when a good Samaritan took her to Lincoln County Animal Shelter. There, vets discovered 80-100 BBs lodged in the dog's face, back and legs.

The one-year-old Labrador, who has since been adopted, miraculously escaped any eye or organ damage and is doing well but Lincoln County Animal Control and the Waldoboro Police Department are trying to track down her attackers.

Hunt: The Lincoln County Animal Control Office is looking for the culprits who covered one-year-old black Labrador Lady with pellets from a BB gun

Boothbay Animal Hospital veterinarian Dr Dean Domeyer, who treated Lady, said the BBs appear to be brass and therefore only need to be removed if they start to infect the dog's skin.

'She's a lucky dog,' Peter Blanton, Lady's new owner, told WCVB.com.

'I mean, she doesn't have any eye damage... and she doesn't seem to have any organ damage, so I think she's going to have a wonderful life. She's very lucky. I think I'm very lucky.'

Dr Domeyer said he thought something was odd when he felt a bump on Lady's snout after she was first brought to authorities.

Riddled: An Xray, pictured, showed some 50 BBs in the animal's head alone

Lucky: There were scores more in Lady's abdomen but she was lucky to get away relatively unharmed

Love: Lady, pictured in an Xray, has since been adopted and is in the care of her new owner

'It wasn't just another little lump. 
You could feel something that was hard and round, and it felt like a BB,
so we decided to take an X-ray,' Dr Domeyer told the station.

One X-ray revealed 50 BB pellets in the dog's head and another showed there were many more scattered throughout her body.

'There are BBs everywhere. There is one pellet and multiple, multiple BBs,' said Dr Domeyer.

Dr Domeyer said the dog appears to be happy and healthy enough but they'll keep monitoring her to ensure she doesn't develop any health concerns at a later date.

Wandering: The stray lab was found two weeks ago wandering in Waldoboro, Maine, before she was taken to the Lincoln County Animal Shelter

'It still remains with Lady whether we are going to have to do anything about these BBs or not,' he said.

'Right now, none of them pose any threat to her. We have also not done any lead levels or blood cell count to make sure there is no issue, and thatâ€™s probably on the docket.'

Meanwhile, the adorable hound is settling in well with her new owner, who is treating her like the high class character she is.

'In just one day, she follows me like a shadow. She just wants love, and we love her,' Blanton said.

The dog avoided any eye or organ damage and because the BBs are brass she probably doesn't need to get them removed
