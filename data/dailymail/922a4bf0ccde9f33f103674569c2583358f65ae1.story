Motorist  Harry Jamieson is always to speed on Britain's roads after becoming the nation's oldest driver - aged 105.

Harry, has clocked up more than TWO MILLION miles since being given his driving licence aged 17 in 1924.

Today he drives an Eighties red Ford Escort which is a bit different from the vehicle he learned to drive in - an armoured Rolls Royce with a top speed of 45mph.

King of the road: Pensioner Harry Jamieson who has been driving for 88 years and never had a parking ticket

Slow driving: Harry learned to drive behind the wheel of an armoured Rolls Royce which had a top speed of 45mph

Harry, has no intentions of parking up for the last time and intends to continue behind the wheel until he dies.

In almost nine decades on Britain's roads, father-of-two Harry, nicknamed Jamie by friends because of his surname, has never had a single penalty point on his licence.

Harry said: 'I love driving and have done it all my working and non-working life, It has been a major part of me.

'I just love the freedom getting into a car gives. There is no boundaries and I can go wherever and whenever I want to.

Road to success: Harry Jamieson got his licence when he was 17 and has owned the same red Ford Escort for the past 20 years

'It is something that I needed from a young age and it has given me a good life as I have seen every part of Britain because of it.

'I do not see myself giving the car up easily. I am very much  at home in a car. I think to myself that it could be possible I have spent more time in my car then I have in my bed.'

Still driving: Harry Jamieson as a young man of 28

After learning on the armoured car, Harry, a great-granddad-of-five  from Worthing, West Sussex, picked up his first car, a Singer 8, for a bargain £35 pounds in 1928.

The year he learnt to drive comedian Benny Hill was born and Lenin was buried in Moscow's Red Square.

Harry, who retired from working as an electrician aged 70, has had his Escort for more than 20 years and it has never broken down.

He added: 'It is the most reliable car I have ever had. If I had my life all over again I would buy another one.

'It has never let me down and is 
beautifully put together. I really do love the car, it is special and a 
major part of me and my life.'

Harry has never been caught speeding or had a parking fine despite his long driving career.

He said: 'I used to travel a lot in my job around the country so I know the roads well. They
are a lot different to what they used to be though. There was a time 
when I would travel half the country and not see another car on the 
road.

'I was in a privileged
position to be able to drive   from such a young age. Having the wind 
blow through your hair is a wonderful feeling.'

London-born
Harry, whose wife Joan recently passed away aged 92 after more than 60 
years together, celebrated his milestone birthday two months ago.

He puts his long-lasting life down to a tipple of brandy a day, a spoonful of money and a healthy glass of red wine.

Harry's
daughter Barbara Leggatt, 64, said: 'I am so proud of him. It is 
extraordinary someone his age is still driving and he looks after 
himself.

'He is still a very
good driver. I feel safer in the car with him then when I am in the car
with a person a lot younger. It amazes me how good he is.

'Like
most people he needs help with parking but everything else he is fine 
with. He has driven most of his life and loves it. He is a special 
person.'
