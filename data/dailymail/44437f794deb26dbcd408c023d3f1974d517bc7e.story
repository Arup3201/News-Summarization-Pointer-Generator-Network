A pensioner has been jailed after offering a nine-year old girl money in exchange for sex. 

Keren Horinek will spend six years in prison after waving a £5 note at the child from the window of his flat in Harwich, Essex, and beckoning her towards him.

The 68-year-old told police he was attracted to young children and would have carried out a sex act on the little girl if she had not run away. 

'A danger to children': Keren Horinek was jailed for six years after admitting he would have sexually assaulted the child had she not run away

Chelmsford Crown Court heard how Horinek stood in the window of his flat near where children were playing on May 18. 

He waved a £10 note at the girl, but moved away when her mother saw him. 

Later, at around 5pm, he reappeared this time with a £5 note and beckoned the child towards him. 

Judge Patricia Lynch sentenced Horinek to six years in prison

Police arrested the man after being called to the scene by the frightened girl's mother.

Horinek was jailed for six years but the judge extended the sentence for an eight year period. 

This means when he is released, Horinek will be on licence for eight years and could be returned to prison if he offends again within this time span.

'You have an attraction to young children and told police you would have abducted the child and would have sexually assaulted her.Mercifully, nothing terrible happened here.' she said. 

'I am satisfied you represent a danger to children especially pre-pubescent girls.'

Upon sentencing Horinek made a series of shocking outbursts, shouting: 'Nothing happened to her.

'By the time I’m released I’ll be bloody dead. I’ll slash my throat. I may as well say cheerio.' 

The pensioner has two previous convictions for burglary with intent to rape after being discovered in the bedroom of a young boy and in the home of a 39-year-old woman on another occasion. 

He has been convicted for indecent assaults on a boy and girl aged under 16 in the past.  

Defending Evelyn Hicks said he had 'some capacity to control his sexual urges'.
