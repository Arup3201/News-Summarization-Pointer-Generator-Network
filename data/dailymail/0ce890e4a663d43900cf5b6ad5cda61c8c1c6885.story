Graeme McDowell faces an anxious wait on Sunday to find out if he will be denied automatic Ryder Cup selection by Steven Gallacher’s late charge in the final round of the Italian Open.

Gallacher carded a 69 on Saturday to finish his third round on 10 under par, four shots off the second place he needs to beat McDowell to the last guaranteed spot in Europe’s team.

The 39-year-old Scot began the tournament in 10th place in the European standings but has shown remarkable resilience to battle back from a disappointing opening round.

Anxious: Graeme McDowell will have to wait until Sunday evening to see if he has an automatic Ryder Cup spot

Chasing: Scot Steven Gallacher is one round away in Turin from displacing McDowell but needs a top-two finish

If he can overhaul fellow Scot Richie Ramsay, who shot a brilliant 66 yesterday to finish on 14-under, or even beat overnight leader Hennie Otto on 16- under, European captain Paul McGinley will have to choose three wildcards from four of his heavyweights: McDowell, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald.

‘I would hate to be the person to deny him a place on the Ryder Cup but I know if it comes down to it, he plays to win and that’s the same attitude I have to have,’ said Ramsay, who holed from 40 feet for birdie on the 18th to complete a flawless 66.

‘Stevie is a fantastic player, as he has shown to get into contention. He will perform on Sunday and I wish him the best in getting (the Ryder Cup place) but I have to accomplish my job of getting into the mix and picking up win number three.’

Friends: Gallacher and Ramsay know each other well and both practise at Kingsfield quite often

McGinley and US captain Tom Watson will name their three wild cards on Tuesday, and it is widely assumed the Irishman would prefer the experience of McDowell, who holed the winning putt at Celtic Manor in 2010, over the untried Scot.

‘Paul’s going to have a tough decision to make,’ said Rory McIlroy this week at the Deutsche Bank Championship. ‘There’s a few guys that in previous years would have been able to make the team on merit and haven’t. Do you go with experience or with form?’

However, Gallacher, who lives just 35 miles from Gleneagles, where the tournament gets underway on September 26, knows the course and two-time Ryder Cup player and former Open champion Paul Lawrie believes his compatriot should still make the team even if he fails to secure a top two finish in Turin on Sunday.

Choices: US captain Tom Watson and European counterpart Paul McGinley will name wild cards on Tuesday

‘If Stephen gets in, he’ll just have the best week of his life,’ Lawrie said. ‘It’s the best tournament there is in golf, there’s no question about that.

‘Poulter, Westwood and Gallacher would be the three that people are talking about. I’m not sure the course suits Donald all that much but, again, he’s hugely experienced. He’s been a world No 1, it would be harsh to leave him out. For me, I think the course sets up better for a Gallacher than it does for a Donald.’

Gallacher, the nephew of three-time Ryder Cup captain Bernard, carded four birdies and a bogey in a solid three under-par round yesterday that leaves him well-placed for a final day charge.

He said: ‘It’s all to play for. You never know what happens in this game and guys have won from further back than this. I’ll just go out and try and get as many birdies as possible and see what happens. It’s a tough week obviously.

I have done my day job and done it well but it is a long week and will take a lot out of me mentally but I have two weeks off after this and one round to go, so will give it my best shot.

This is the only time in my career that I would be happy not to win a golf tournament. Second will do me fine on Sunday.’
