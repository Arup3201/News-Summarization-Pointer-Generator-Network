Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond was challenged about his plans to join the EU

Alex Salmond today desperately insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to stay in the European Union, after the idea was rejected out of hand by the Prime Minister of Spain.

The Scottish National Party’s blueprint for independence depends on Scotland negotiating its way into the EU.

But the plan collapse within 24 hours when Spain’s Mariano Rajoy insisted it could not become an EU member automatically and he would veto it.

Mr Salmond has insisted that Scotland would be able to join the EU if it votes Yes to independence next year but Mr Rajoy’s intervention exploded that claim.

Spain is opposed to Scottish secession since the government in Madrid is also resisting attempts by Catalonia and the Basque region to break away.

The Spanish premier told a press conference: ‘If part of a member state becomes independent, it would be left out of the European Union and it would be good for citizens (in the EU) and Scots to know that," he is reported to have said.

Mr Rajoy added this meant ‘EU entry would need to be approved by all 28 member states’.

He went on: ‘I am very clear, as everyone is, that a country that obtained independence from the EU would end up outside of it, and it’s right that Scottish citizens and all the citizens of the Union know that.

‘What I want is for the Scottish to be presented realistically with the consequences of secession.

‘If one part if a member state splits, it would become a third country in relation to the EU. It is the law.’

He added: ‘The times we live in demand strong countries and unity is not contrary to autonomy, it is a guarantee of strength in an increasingly complex and globalised world.’ 

The remarks from one of the EU’s senior 
leaders have been seized on by opponents of independence, who challenged
Mr Salmond at Hollyrood today.

Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said that all 28 EU member states would have to agree to allow a new member in, and he would be likely to veto Scotland

The First Minister said if there was a Yes vote in next year's referendum Scotland would be ‘negotiating its position from within the European Union’ - citing a letter from the European Commission in support of this.

Labour's Johann Lamont, Tory Ruth Davidson and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie all attacked Mr Salmond on the matter at First Minister's Questions.

Ms Lamont went on the attack, saying: ‘The Spanish prime minister is being straighter with the people of Scotland than the First Minister.’

But Mr Salmond said: ‘The difference is Scotland would be negotiating its position from within the European Union.’

The First Minister then cited a letter from the European Commission, which he said stated it would ‘of course be legally possible to renegotiate the situation of the UK and Scotland within the European Union’.

He said that was ‘reasonably substantial evidence that Scotland as a nation can negotiate its position to full membership within the European Union’.

On Tuesday Mr Salmond launched his historic 670-page blueprint covering all areas of life in an independent
Scotland.

At the launch he was dogged
by questions about how he will get the Westminster government, 
Brussels, Nato, Buckingham Palace and the BBC to agree to his ambitious 
plans.

It revealed he wants the UK to continue to bail-out 
Scotland's banks, shoulder its debts and fund degrees for its students.

And
it spelt out in bizarre detail that shows like Eastenders, Doctor Who 
and Strictly Come Dancing and kids' channel Cbeebies would remain on 
air, in an attempt to counter fears from TV viewers that they would be 
cut off from the BBC.
