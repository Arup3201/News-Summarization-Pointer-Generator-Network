The Antiques Roadshow has been mining Idaho - nicknamed The Gem State, for hidden treasures and found one gentleman who had an Edward Hopper etching hanging on his wall worth $250,000.

Host Mark L. Walberg and appraiser Gary Piattoni headed to the Old Idaho State Penitentiary and came across one Boise man who had inherited the 1922 etching entitled The Cat Boat from his grandfather.

The unnamed owner explained how the print that had been in his family for many years, came into his possession.

Cash on the wall: One hopeful man from Boisie Idahoo took an etching he had inherited from his grandfather to the Antiques Roadshow. Much to his surprise he found out it was valued at $250,000

'I acquired it though inheritance. My grandfather was a member of the New York Society Of Etchers and began a collection at that time that I inherited.'

The owner explained that the item was one of a number of things that he grew up around, but only recently had its value explained to him.

'I liked it over a long period of time. I liked it irrespective of its value.Someone took me aside and said I think that a famous artists that did that!' the owner said.

His friends' suspicion was confirmed. 'You have an etching by the artist Edward Hopper, a very famous American painter and printmaker,' said Todd Weyman, the show's appraiser.

How much do you think it's worth? Antiques Roadshow's Todd Weyman (right) valued the etching at $250,000

Edward Hopper (1882-1967): As an artist he was known for scenes of contemporary American life, including the famous painting of people in a diner, 'Nighthawks' and latterly his etchings

Edward Hopper was a prominent American realist painter and printmaker.

While he was most well known for his oil paintings, he was an exceptionally proficient watercolorist and printmaker in etching.

When Hopper turned to etching's he produced approximately 70 works, many of urban scenes of both Paris and New York.

Many people know his work through his paintings of solitary people in various scenes around New York, such as eating in diners or being alone at night.

His work has been the subject of blockbuster solo exhibitions at museums.

It wasn't until the early 1920s his etchings began to receive public recognition.

The program's appraiser, Mr Weyman told the owner that it was a beautiful etching and noticed Hopper's signature at the bottom.

'He printed his etchings in very small editions,' he said. 'There are probably fewer than 25 of these in existence.'

'You  have a top print by an extremely important American artist from the most important decade of his career.'

Style: Hopper used to use very white paper and dark black inks to bring out the color and shadings perfectly

Shocked: The owner cannot believe how much the etching is worth upon hearing the valuation

Sticker shock: The etching had been given to this man by his grandfather who was a member of the New York Etchings Society

Not wanting to be drawn on estimating the value of the etching, the owner kept quiet.

Mr Weyman continued, 'I would suggest you insure it to the value of $250,000.'

'Really!' exclaimed the owner, clearly shocked yet delighted at his valuation. 'That's more money than belongs in my living room!'

'It's a real masterpiece and you're lucky to have it,' said Antiques Roadshow's Mr Weyman, who had struggled throughout to contain his excitement at being presented with such a piece.

The picture is now going back on the Boise living room wall where it has hung for many years.

You can view an exhibition of Hopper's work at the Dallas Museum of Art through February.

Signature work: The work was personally signed by Edward Hopper and it even appears as though the artist rubbed out his first attempt before rewriting it
