In Tottenham's long and illustrious history, there is no such thing as a routine victory. This club thrives on the thrill of the chase.

They are programmed to do everything the hard way and here at White Hart Lane, in this third round replay against Burnley, there was no exception.

They set themselves the most strenuous test, conceding twice within the opening seven minutes against Sean Dyche's spirited Burnley team. Spurs got there in the end.

Their recovery means that from the moment Mauricio Pochettino's team set foot at White Hart Lane on Saturday for a 3pm kick off against Sunderland, Spurs will begin a treacherous run of five games in 15 days in three competitions.

Dare it be said, with a Capital One Cup semi-final against Sheffield United to come, an FA Cup tie with Leicester and a shot at fourth place in the Barclays Premier League, they are a successful outfit.

This is what the players are in the business for and Tottenham deserve to be in the fourth round after this impressive, yet ultimately comfortable, comeback.

Tottenham's manager had fiddled with his formation, mixing things up after their setback at Selhurst Park on Saturday, where they were beaten 2-1 by Crystal Palace.

To play Michel Vorm in place of Hugo Lloris, to promote Danny Rose to orthodox left wing and to swap Roberto Soldado for the 18 goals of Harry Kane takes some time to acclimatise to.

By the end, when they were 4-2 up and turning their attentions to Saturday's clash with Sunderland, they looked the business.

To Pochettino's credit there was even a nod in the direction of the long-term future of the club when he sent on young Josh Onomah for the final 14 minutes. There is much more to come from him.

Back to Burnley and the incredible and the opening seven minutes of this third round replay.

They went in front after two minutes when Marvin Sordell's corkscrew beat Michel Vorm from distance and added another when Ross Wallace's free-kick was guided into the net off the shoulder of Roberto Soldado. It was an eventful evening for the Spurs striker.

In the great pantheon of misses, the moment Soldado hit the crossbar from a few yards out with the goal at his mercy is right up there with Ronny Rosenthal at Villa Park in 1992. 

The Spurs forward has form for this, somehow skying a routine cross in a Europa League tie against FC Dnipro in February last year. Which was worse? It's a tough call.

Still, there was something positive about his game, playing his part in the ninth-minute goal that prompted Spurs' comeback at White Hart Lane.

From Andros Townsend's cross down the right, Soldado's flick on fell to Paulinho and the Brazilian midfielder chested the ball down and volleyed beyond Tom Heaton.

There was a sense then that the comeback was on, that this Tottenham team would begin to stir after the impressive move that led to that opening goal.

After Soldado blew his big chance, Etienne Capoue equalised on the stroke of half-time with a well-placed effort that beat Heaton from distance. Game on.

When they emerged for the second half, the impetus was with Tottenham and their fans dreaming of Wembley in the South Stand.

It is too soon to check the availability of Chas & Dave, but there will be a few among that number forecasting their ninth FA Cup win in May. There is way to go yet, particularly with the development of this team.

Sordell took his early chance, scoring for the first time since his move to Turf Moor on a free transfer from nearby Bolton last summer.

His career has plateaued in recent seasons, struggling to make an impression at the Reebok following his £3m move from Watford and farmed out on loan to Charlton last season.

Back in London he took his chance for Sean Dyche's side, taking advantage of the customary confusion in Tottenham's defence when Jan Vertonghen and Younes Kaboul failed to clear.

Spurs wobbled again, conceding a second when Ross Wallace's left-foot free kick deflected off Soldado and beat diving figure of Vorm.

What a start for this Burnley side, making the running and roared on by a few hundred brave supporters clad in claret and blue who made the trip south.

Their ambitions to win here ended at the start of the second half when Vlad Chiriches scored their third goal in the 48th minute.

Dyche claimed a corner was incorrectly given, launching into the fourth official and yelling at him that there was little point having radio contact with referee Chris Pawson if he didn't use it.

The goal appeared telepathic, with Chiriches arriving at the far post to head in Paulinho's corner.

Spurs scored again when Soldado set up Rose, steaming into the penalty area, to apply the finishing touch at the far post.

They are safely through, but Spurs cannot resist the odd scare.
