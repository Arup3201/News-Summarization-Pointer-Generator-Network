Anyone curious about what bankers are really thinking should nip over to Twitter and peruse the anonymous account relaying outrageous comments reportedly overheard in the elevators of mega-bank Goldman Sachs.

The feed of GS Elevator Gossip (@GSElevator) provides daily snippets purportedly eavesdropped by a Goldman banker from inside the walls of the company's headquarters in London, New York and Hong Kong.

And now the jaw-dropping tweets - which began in August 2011 and now boast almost half a million followers - have been turned into a series of online comedy videos using puppets.

The avatar for the Twitter account is Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein

The Twitter account - whose avatar is Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein - is used to relay all the arrogant, sexist, cynical, chauvinistic, conceited, self-important right-wing chatter claiming to have been heard not only in the lifts for the Wall Street bank, but also in corridors, meetings and at trader events.

Snide remarks include: 'I say "keep the change" purely for my own convenience'; 'No one would run a marathon if they had to sign a confidentiality agreement first'; 'I don't care how hot she is, dumb is not sexy'; 'we have street cred on the only street that counts'; 'If someone asks you a question and you don't know the answer, belittle them. It's better to be an asshole than stupid' and 'If there really was a glass ceiling, we'd let all the women work above us'.

There are also conversations heard between people, such as: '#1: George Bush spent 8 years putting a giant "Kick Me" sign on America's back, yet people blame Obama. #2: Do you work here?' 

CNBC has now turned the tweets into a series of videos starring puppet bankers

The tweets subscribe to the stereotypical belief that bankers are all smug, self-important and void of empathy

In an interview with the New York Times, the anonymous tweeter behind the page said of his identity: 'Simply put, I am a banker who has some free time now that market volatility and the usual August summer lull has brought capital markets to a virtual halt. 

'I am also someone who has long been cynical of the industry and the people that build their entire sense of self around it.'

Explaining why he launched the account, he added: 'I wanted to amuse myself during the summer lull and while market volatility keeps capital markets transactions to a minimum.

'I also thought that despite the disdain out there that exists for Wall Street professionals, people still really have no idea really how bad it is - and how shallow the industry really is, and frankly, how unimpressive 98 per cent of the employees are.'

The outrageous tweets are said to be written by a banker at Goldman Sachs

On the accompanying GSElevator wordpress site, the founder says he gets several tweets a day asking if the feed is fake, and wondering why, if the stories are true, bankers appear to have all their most outrageous conversations in lifts.

To this he references the now-defunct Twitter account Conde Elevator, which relayed comments overheard in the lift for Conde Nast.

He says: 'I have always said, to the extent that it isn't already totally obvious, that these aren't just elevators.

'The only reason the name and basic premise is such, is as a tribute to the @condeelevator that I copied when I started... So it's bars, hotels, lobbies, airplanes, analyst drinks, trading floors, dates, Bloomberg chartrooms. Anywhere, you name it.'

The banker who claims to be behind the feed says of the industry: 'People still really have no idea really how bad it is, how shallow and, frankly, how unimpressive 98 per cent of the employees are'

The former Twitter account Conde Elevator tweeted conversations overheard in the New York offices of Conde Nast, who publish magazines including Vogue, Tatler, Vanity Fair and Glamour

The tweets have now been made into a series of short online comedy films by US channel CNBC using Muppet-style puppets.

The shorts, entitled The Puppets Can Hear You Now, see the tweets reenacted verbatim by puppets, and are the channel's homage to the Twitter account as part of the channel's new Digital Workshop studio.

'Some chick I was talking to at the bar last night asked me what I'd do if I had 10 millon bucks,' says the first puppet in one video.

'What did you say?' asks his puppet friend. 'I said I told her I'd ask where the rest of my money had gone.'
