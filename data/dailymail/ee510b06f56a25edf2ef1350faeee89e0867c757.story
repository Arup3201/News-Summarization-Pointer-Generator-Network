This is the stomach-churning moment a man has a huge splinter yanked out of his thigh - with a pair of pliers.

The video was taken of a skater in New York, who had just had an accident with his board.

The splinter eventually hauled out of the back of his thigh is around 2 inches in length - and covered in blood.

Posting a video of the gruesome experience on YouTube, he explained: 'The skateboard shot up and hit me in the thigh.'

The clip shows the unnamed skater surrounded by his friends in a car park - already stripped down to his boxer shorts.

Turning around to show his friends the wound, one comments: 'Dude, it's like IN there.'

Armed with a hefty-sized pliers, the friend tasked with removing the huge shard of wood, admits: 'I'm so nervous right now.' 

He then stabs around at the area before eventually declaring: 'Buddy, I got it good.' 

Viewers can see the skin bulging from the inside as the splinter is coaxed out, before it pulls free from skin - covered in blood.

As the victim lets out an agonising scream, he screams: 'That feels sooooo good.'

To which his friend says: 'I had no idea how big that was going to be.' 

The video was filmed in Astoria Skatepark in Brooklyn, NY. 

After the huge splinter is removed, the victim screams: 'That feels sooooo good.' To which his friend says: 'I had no idea how big that was going to be'
