A businessman has been awarded £6million of taxpayers’ money after a court ruled he was wrongly arrested by the Serious Fraud Office.

Entrepreneur Vincent Tchenguiz was questioned when the SFO carried out a dawn raid on his home in 2011.

It was part of an inquiry into the collapse of Kaupthing bank, one of three Icelandic banks to fold during the 2008 credit crunch.

But after the investigation collapsed, a judicial review at the High Court quashed the search warrants and was highly critical of the SFO’s conduct.

Now, in a final settlement, the SFO has agreed to pay Mr Tchenguiz £3million to settle the case and a further £3million towards his legal costs within 21 days.

However, the agency has yet to settle with Mr Tchenguiz’s younger brother Robert, who said last night he intends to pursue a £100million claim.

The Iranian-born brothers, who together are worth an estimated £850million, were seeking a record £300million in damages from the agency before yesterday’s settlement with Vincent.

Robert, 53, said last night: ‘I was unceremoniously arrested in a dawn raid on the morning of March 9, 2011, by the City of London Police, at the behest of the SFO.

‘The media had been tipped off and were present before the police arrived to exercise the warrants.

‘I intend to continue to pursue this claim through the courts in order to right the wrongs that have been done.’

Vincent Tchenguiz, 57, said: ‘I am happy to accept this settlement from the Serious Fraud Office and bring to a close my disputes with them.

‘Whilst I and my business have suffered serious and significant damage at the hands of the SFO, it has become increasingly apparent that the SFO’s investigation was influenced by certain third parties, acting in their own commercial interests.

‘I have settled my case against the SFO and intend to focus my attentions on those other parties whom I consider are responsible.

‘However, I hope that the SFO has learned lessons from this sorry episode in its history and the serious errors which led to my investigation and arrest are never repeated.

‘I have maintained my innocence since day one and this settlement and apology that I have received from the SFO is total vindication for me.’

Vincent – who like his brother lives in Kensington, West London – had claimed he had been the victim of false imprisonment, trespass, misfeasance in public office and malicious prosecution.

The SFO said in a statement that it was ‘pleased’ to settle the claim and admitted ‘mistakes’ had been made in the case.

But a Taxpayers’ Alliance spokesman said: ‘This sorry episode has cost the taxpayers millions, but what’s most galling is the fact that the SFO believes it’s doing the public a favour by handing out bumper compensation payments.

‘The whole affair has been entirely avoidable, and those responsible must be held accountable.

‘This kind of waste cannot be tolerated if Britain is to bring down its £1.3trillion debt mountain.’ 

David Green, the director of the SFO, said: ‘I am pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter without the need for a costly trial. 

'The SFO deeply regrets the errors for which we were criticised by the High Court in July 2012.

‘On behalf of the SFO I apologise to Mr Tchenguiz for what happened to him.’

The SFO was looking at why substantial funds flooded out of the Kaupthing bank in the days before it failed in 2008.

Vincent Tchenguiz had borrowed £100million from the Icelandic bank shortly before its collapse. Both he and his brother have always denied any wrongdoing.
