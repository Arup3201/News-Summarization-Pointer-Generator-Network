Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo looks to be enjoying his time on loan at Valencia in Spain.

The club are riding high in fifth place in La Liga and judging by a clip of the Spain international in training, he wants to help continue the club's resurgence in style.

He was seen rehearsing the rabona in training with a team-mate and judging by the clip, he may fancy his chances of using it in a game.

Negredo managed to pick out a team-mate with ease using the skill and it could be something to look out for when Valencia take on Almeria on Saturday.

The 29-year-old has played 14 times for Valencia so far during his loan spell, scoring twice. 

The forward returned to Spain after a difficult season last year at Manchester City where, despite a strong start in England, he fell out of favour under manager Manuel Pellegrini.
