Millionaire Chinese businessmen wanting to settle in the UK has led to a surge in the number of British visas given to wealthy foreigners from outside the EU.

Investor visas issued to the wealthy Chinese jumped from 95 to 171, for Americans from 19 to 66 and for Russians from 99 to 125.

The visas allow migrants to invest £1 million, £5 million or £10 million in government bonds or British business.

The rise in those issued to Chinese millionaires comes after David Cameron, on a trade trip to Beijing last month, encouraged Chinese entrepreneurs to put their cash in the UK.

The number of investor visas issued to wealthy foreigners has jumped 25%, with demand from the wealthy Chinese leading the surge

'If you are investing in Britain, 
invest more,' the Prime Minister told Chinese businessmen and women. 'If you
 are thinking of investing in Britain, come and find us. You will get a 
warm welcome.'

In 
return for investing their millions, wealthy foreigners get permission 
to apply for permanent residency in five, three or two years 
respectively.

After being allowed to settle permanently, investors may apply to become British citizens.

The visa figures were disclosed by Pinsent Masons law firm following a Freedom of Information request.

Visas issued to wealthy Chinese jumped from 95 to 71. They come to Britain because they feel their wealth is better protected in a democratic and transparent country.

They show investor visas jumped from 423 in 2011-12 to 530 in 2012-13.

In addition to the 530 investor visas, 1,038 visas were issued for applicants' dependents.

The number of investor visas issued to Egyptians nearly doubled to 19.

Applicants need not speak English and may bring their spouses and dependents to study or work.

Investor visas are an increasingly popular way for wealthy individuals to obtain UK residency.

To
 qualify, the applicant must have at least £1m of their own funds, which
 must be invested within three months of arriving in the UK.

Unlike other categories of visa, individuals applying for an investor visa do not need to meet an English language requirement, and are able to bring their spouse and dependents to the UK to work or study.

Direct investment in UK businesses creates thousands of new jobs every year.

However,
 an inquiry by the Migration Advisory Committee, which counsels the 
Government, found that most using the investor visa route bought gilts 
that Britain did not need when the Treasury is selling £300 million of 
gilts every day to fund the deficit.

Sir David Metcalf, chairman 
of the committee, said that wealthy investors sometimes held the gilts 
for five years and then sold them.

This effectively amounted to making a loan to gain indefinite leave to stay in the country.

Chinese
 investors now make up the largest group of all successful applications,
 accounting for 32% of all investor visas issued this year.

Investors from the USA received 12% of all visas issued.

Britain benefits from the thriving Chinese economy, with Chinese shoppers flocking to London and millionaires coming to invest their cash

Jill Turner, senior associate at Pinsent Masons, says: 'High Net Worth Individuals continue to pick the UK over other major international cities as they seek a safe haven for wealth.''The UK benefits from a very stable, liquid economy, and is free from any governmental interference in the assets of private individuals or any political instability.

'The UK government is also pro-business, with relatively low tax rates imposed on businesses and London has a reputation for being more welcoming of foreign nationals who benefit from the favourable tax environment.

'By contrast, China and Russia has a fairly volatile stock and 
housing market that can make it a risky place to invest, and many of the
 Chinese investors who flock to the UK feel that their wealth is better 
protected in a democratic country.'

For US investors, the booming Silicon Roundabout is a major attraction. Many American investors have expertise in the IT and technology in their own country, and want to capitalise on the growing high-tech sector in the UK.

The number of investor visas issued to Egyptian nationals has nearly doubled in the last year, from just 10 visas issued last year to 19 this year.   

Political and economic instability in Egypt has prompted many wealthy families to divert their funds into the UK.

Even the recent announcement that the Government will be charging Capital Gains Tax on the sale of properties owned by foreign investors from April 2015 isn’t discouraging foreign investment into the UK property market.

Ms Turner says: 'High Net Worth Individuals continue to be attracted to the UK to invest in property, especially at the moment with house prices and rents soaring.'

'While the Capital Gains Tax levy may discourage some smaller investors from investing in UK property, the majority will not be put off by the charges.'
