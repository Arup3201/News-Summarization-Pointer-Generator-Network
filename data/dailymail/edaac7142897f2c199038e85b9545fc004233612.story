It might be one of the biggest games in the club's history, but Hull's players looked in relaxed mood ahead of their flight from Humberside airport to London for Saturday's FA Cup final.

Manager Steve Bruce and his players flew south on Friday afternoon, just over 24 hours before they take on Arsenal at Wembley.

Liam Rosenior, George Boyd, Yannick Sagbo and Tom Huddlestone were among the Tigers stars spotted in the departure lounge, while Bruce enjoyed a chat with son Alex before take-off.

Belief: Hull boss Bruce has called on his players to cause an upset against Arsenal in the FA Cup final

It's 20 years to the week since Bruce 
lifted the FA Cup as captain of Manchester United and memories of that 
illustrious day still burn as intensely as ever for 53-year-old.

Bruce said: 'We must be rank outsiders, but that's the beauty of the FA Cup. Manchester City were huge favourites last year but Wigan came up and won the thing and that's why, for me, it's the greatest competition.

'For a club like ours to take on the mighty Arsenal has a fantastic ring to it. The club has never been there in its history, so it's a wonderful achievement. But you've got to try to grasp the occasion and enjoy it, because if you're not careful it just goes past you.'

Bruce made his cup final debut in 1990 as United edged past Crystal Palace after a replay, and returned as captain four years later to marshal United to a stunning 4-0 final win over Glenn Hoddle's Chelsea.

After also captaining United in a 1-0 final defeat to Everton in 1995, Bruce was left out of the side for the 1996 win over Liverpool due to injury.

Bruce recalled: 'My first one was in 1990 and it was the showpiece, the pinnacle of the season. There was a clamour of it and I'm reminded of the intensity and of the attention.

'It was over in a blur. Not many of them are married but I told the players it's a bit like your wedding day - before you know it you're married, and before you know it the FA Cup final's gone.

'The memories of the FA Cup are the ones you cherish when you've finished your playing career.

'The ones you really remember are your FA Cup days and, believe me, it's far better when you've won one than when you've lost one.'

On the face of it, the Tigers are hardly in the best of shapes going into their first final, having rounded off their Barclays Premier League campaign with a run of five successive games without a win.

In addition, they are shorn of cup-tied frontmen Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long, and have doubts over a number of players including another striker in Sone Aluko and defender Paul McShane.

But there is better news for Bruce with goalkeeper Allan McGregor staging a successful comeback from kidney damage which was initially expected to keep him out for the rest of the season, and Robbie Brady also pushing for a surprise recall after his groin operation.

For Bruce, the poor end-of-season run which followed the tumultuous 5-3 semi-final win over Sheffield United was more than mere coincidence.

'We try but we can't keep it normal - you can tell that,' Bruce added.

'You can't put a lid on it. They're playing in arguably the biggest game of their career and that's what you play football for. All they've thought about for four weeks is the FA Cup final.

'When you play for your youth team or your district team you want to do one thing - play in the FA Cup final. There's a spring in their step and so there should be.

'Everybody enjoys a shock and, if you're not an Arsenal fan, I'm sure the rest of the world will be rooting for Hull.

'The reality is it's a one-off, and it's a place where heroes are made. Who can be that hero and go and win us the FA Cup?'
