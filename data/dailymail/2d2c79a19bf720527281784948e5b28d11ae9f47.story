Shopping is more pleasurable than sex for more than half of British women, a new survey has revealed.

Fifty-five per cent said that a good day out at the shops is a bigger thrill than spending time between the sheets, even though 10 per cent of items purchased will never make it out of the wardrobe.

A retail-addicted 11 per cent told researchers that shopping is always better than love-making, regardless of the circumstances.

Thrill: For more than half of British women, a day shopping is better than a night of passion with their husband

The study of 2000 British women, all of whom were in relationships, also found that the average woman thinks about shopping six times a week compared with four times a week spent indulging in 'sexy' thoughts.

Worryingly, the study also found that shopping can be a source of tension for couples, with 37 per cent saying that joint shopping trips are often the cause of a heated row.

As a result, the majority of women prefer to shop with friends or alone, with just 16 per cent saying that they wanted to spend more time shopping with their partners.

Even children were seen as a better choice of shopping partner - 23 per cent of the mothers polled said their husbands were more trouble than their offspring.

Holly Valance, the host of TLC’s new 
TV series Ultimate Shopper, which commissioned the study, said: 'For 
many of us ladies, a great day out at the shops is the ultimate 
indulgent guilty pleasure.

'The
odd impulse buy that never gets worn is a small price to pay given how 
much satisfaction a spot of retail therapy can give!

'We
hope our new series Ultimate Shopper will remind people just how much 
fun shopping can be and how incredible British high-street fashion is.'

But the survey also found that the British passion for fashion also resulted in a significant amount of wasted cash, with nine per cent admitting that 30 per cent of the things they buy are never used or worn.

Wasteful habits were particularly notable among those who splashed the cash on accessories, with over a third of women admitting to owning at least three pairs of shoes that they have never worn while nearly a fifth have at least three unused handbags gathering dust. 

In total, the average woman has unworn clothing and accessories worth £697.23 piled up in their closets.

The stack of unworn and unwanted clothing also has a negative impact on stress levels, with more than a quarter of women polled admitting that they suffer from regular bouts of guilt thanks to the amount of shopping they do.

Nearly one in ten said they felt guilty every single time they hit the shops.

Most likely to prefer shopping to sex: Women from Northern Ireland are most likely to admit that good shopping is 
always better than good sex, with 22 per cent confessing to preferring splashing the cash.  15 per cent of women in Yorkshire & the 
Humber and 14 per cent of women from the East Midlands.

Most likely to fight with their partners: On average, those in the West 
Midlands fight the most with their partner while shopping, as over four 
in ten trips end in a row

Most likely to shop with a partner: Couples in Northern Ireland 
shop together with the least drama as less than a third of shopping 
trips end in an argument.

Least likely to shop with a partner: 12 per cent of Londoners said they wouldn't shop with a husband or boyfriend - more than any other group.

Most likely to shop alone: 53 per cent of women in Northern Ireland said they preferred to do their retail therapy without anyone around to see what they buy.
