On the internet, cats rule all.

The latest app hoping to take advantage of this obsession with our feline friends is Klooff.

Dubbed a ‘social petwork’, Klooff lets pet owners create profiles for their animals, with details of the pet’s breed, age and even interests.

And it’s not just fot cats, Klooff is open to all pets including dogs, parrots, rabbits and even snakes - although the latter may not be as popular among the masses.

The Klooff app, pictured, lets pet owners create profiles for their animals, including details of breed, age and interests. Owners can then share photos of their pets, and rate the photos of others. The most popular pets are shown on a grid - and its makers hope it will find viral stars similar to Grumpy Cat

Klooff isn’t the first so-called social petwork.

YummyPets launched in the UK last year after proving popular in France.

YummyPets
 more closely resembles Facebook, and as well as letting owners post 
photos and updates for their pets, the site helps put them in touch with
 useful and local pet services. 

It can also be used to find missing pets, and features an instant messaging service.

Elsewhere, MySocialPetwork looks like a Pinterest for pets.

Grids of animals photos are organised by tags, and individual photos can be liked and pinned. 

The free app looks like an animal-friendly Instagram - owners set up profiles using basic information and post photos, videos or GIFs of their pets, that then appear in a news feed.

Users can follow their favourite animals, or can browse popular and random animals through the Featured tab, as well as see What's Hot, and discover Suggested Users.

Each photo can be liked and shared, and users can also leave comments.

The most popular photos, based on these interactions, are then shown on the Top 10 tab that updates in real-time. 

The idea behind the app is to give owners a way of sharing photos of their pets with like-minded people.

Yet
 its makers also hope it will be used to find the next viral pet, 
similar to Grumpy Cat. During a promotional video, Klooff's makers claim owners can 
use the app to 'celebrify' their pet.

Each individual photo can be liked and shared, and users can also leave comments, pictured left. Users can additionally follow their favourite animals, browse popular and random animals through the Featured tab, as well as see What's Hot, and discover Suggested Users

The app is currently in beta, and is only available for iOS devices, yet already has in the region of 15,000 users.
