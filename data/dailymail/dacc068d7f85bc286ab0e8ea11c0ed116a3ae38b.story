Patient: Matthew Willey, 15, was diagnosed with a form of bone cancer, osteosarcoma

A teenage cancer sufferer had part of his leg removed and treated at a hospital three miles away before it was put back in while he was still on the operating table.

Matthew Willey, 15, had a foot-long piece of shin bone taken out for radiotherapy treatment in a 10-hour operation to save his leg after he was diagnosed with bone cancer.

The schoolboy went to his GP in January with pain in his leg, and was referred to Leeds General Infirmary where he was warned by doctors he could lose the limb.

He was sent to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham and was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, after numerous tests.

His mother Julie, 51, said: 'Matthew's reaction was, '"t can take my leg but it's not having my life".

'We just went to bits.'

The
brave teenager had intensive chemotherapy before undergoing the 
operation where his tibia was removed and taken by the surgeon to Queen 
Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where it was irradiated to tackle the cancer and then re-implanted.

The bone had to be taken to Queen Elizabeth because the paediatric ward Matthew was being operated in did not have the right equipment.

His
father William, 42, said: 'We were relieved they were going to save his
leg because the feedback at first was that he was going to lose it.

'It's better to have your own bone in there with a metal pin, and it will knit back together.'

After ten days in hospital, Matthew returned home and restarted chemotherapy at Leeds General Infirmary.

He is due to finish at Christmas but 
will carry on being treated with new bone cancer drug mifamurtide, for 
which doctors had to get specialist funding.

The drug, which cuts the risk of death by nearly a third, has now been given the green light by NHS bosses.

A metal frame has been inserted to hold Matthew's leg together and he has also had a skin graft.

Matthew's parents, who are foster carers, said their son has been an inspiration and praised the care he has received.

Julie said: 'It's been an awful ten months but he has never once given in. He's been as brave as anything.'

Dr Simone Wilkins, Matthew's consultant at Leeds General Infirmary, said: 'In Matthew's case, surgeons used his own bone which was removed, treated with radiotherapy and replaced, which is a technique which has been used for the last couple of years to try to avoid amputation.'

Surgeons were unsure whether Matthew's unusual operation had worked until they removed the cast from his left leg two weeks ago following the operation on July 6 this year.

William said: 'Matthew had to have a full cast from his groin downwards, completely covering his left leg and it was only when they took it off they said the operation had been a success.

'The surgeon was so dedicated, he took the bone out then took it himself to the other hospital to make sure everything was fine.

'The bone was out of his body for about three or four hours.'

He added: 'They had quite a few options before the surgery - they could have amputated, which obviously nobody wanted - or they could have put a titanium piece in the leg to replace the bone, but there is a greater chance of infection then.

'Matthew has been incredibly brave throughout this, we're really proud of him. He's still having chemotherapy, which we hope will finish on Christmas Eve.'
