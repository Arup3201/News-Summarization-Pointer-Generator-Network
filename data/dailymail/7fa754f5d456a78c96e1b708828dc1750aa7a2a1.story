It's the ultimate evil for anyone attempting to follow a strict low-carbohydrate diet.

When it comes to shedding the pounds bread is generally regarded as bad.

But dieters desperate to indulge in a sandwich for lunch or an extra slice of toast for breakfast will welcome the arrival of a supermarket loaf with 'half the carbs of regular bread.'

Dieters' dream: LivLife high protein content will allow the calorie-conscious to indulge in sandwiches without worrying about eating too many carbs

With health foods increasingly big business, Waitrose has recently launched the new LivLife 'low carb' bread in its stores.

Billed by the marketing men as 'a brand new concept in bread,' the manufacturers have replaced wheat flours with natural protein flours, seeds and grains.

The supermarket chain's new LivLife bread contains 50 per cent less carbohydrate than regular varieties: 14.6g per 100g in a Seriously Seeded loaf, compared with a typical 42.7g, Waitrose says.

Its 67 calories per slice compare with the 103 calories in Kingsmill 50/50 and the 116 calories in Hovis Soft White.

Natalie McAdam, a nutritionist who worked on LivLife, said high protein flours from soya had been used to reduce the wheat flour.

'Carbohydrates have had a terrible reputation so it isn't surprising so many people had cut them out from their diets,' she said.

'However, we are a nation of sandwich lovers and although bread is seen as the worst offender of all carbs, it's the one food product that consumers can't live without.'

The new loaf may well lead to a variety of weight-conscious celebrities heading for their nearest supermarket.

The Duchess of Cambridge is said to have followed the low-carb and high-protein Dukan diet before the royal wedding, while actress Gwyneth Paltrow has said she avoids feeding bread to her children Apple, eight, and Moses, six, because she thinks it is bad for them.

Nicholas & Harris, the company behind the LivLife bread, claims 40% of adults are trying to cut their carbohydrate consumption.

In Germany the low carbs bread market is worth Â£65m and the bakery firm hopes the UK market will follow the trend.

The company is also reportedly hoping to tackle the next 'low-carb' evil by expanding into the pasta market next year.

The NHS advice for healthy eating is that starchy foods - such as potatoes, cereals, pasta, rice and bread - should make up around one third of the food people eat.
