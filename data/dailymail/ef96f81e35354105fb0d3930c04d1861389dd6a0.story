A Chinese woman had a miraculous escape when her car was buried under tons of rice after a lorry tipped over.

It took rescuers an hour to dig out Lin Hen, 33, after the crash in Luoyang in China's central Henan province.

She was carried from the wreckage wearing only one shoe and with bloody scratches over her arms.

Lin Hen, who was driving to her sister's wedding at the time, survived the crash inside her crushed black car

Crowds gathered around the scene as emergency services worked to shift the sacks of rice and found Ms Lin inside her black car.

She was on her way to her sister's wedding at the time.

The lorry driver told police that his 
brakes had failed when he tried to slow down, and he had found himself 
unable to stop as the truck picked up speed.

He tried to swerve to avoid the woman's car but the road was wet and the lorry tipped over.

Ms Hen's lucky escape follows a crash in Guanxi province last week where a woman smashed her head through the windscreen of her car - and survived.

The unnamed woman, who was a passenger in the car, was not wearing her seatbelt when the vehicle hit the back of a lorry.

Her head broke the glass and she became wedged in the hole.

When
 fire crews arrived on the scene, they had to remove the car's 
unconscious driver from the car before they could painstakingly begin 
freeing the woman.

Firefighters were then able to slowly
 enlarge the hole in the windscreen around her neck so that it was big 
enough for the injured woman's head to be safely freed.

Bloodied
 and dazed, the woman was stretchered away by waiting paramedics and 
taken to a nearby hospital, where she and the male driver were said to 
be making a full recovery.
