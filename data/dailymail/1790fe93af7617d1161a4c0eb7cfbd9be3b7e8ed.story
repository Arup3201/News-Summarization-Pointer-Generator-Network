Marks & Spencer join Burberry, Tom Ford and Alexander McQueen today as they present their first designer menswear range on the catwalk at London Collections: Men.

Their Best of British AW14 collection preview show, held at the Hospital Club in London, marks a shift for the High Street retailer, who are hoping to rival Savile Row with their sophisticated range.

After a Christmas slump, M&S have suffered nine straight quarters of declining sales in clothing and homeware, so much rides on their foray into luxury menswear.

British swagger: 'These are classic pieces mixed in a more contemporary way'

Inspired by M&S's rich heritage, the Best of British range celebrates the best in British design and manufacture.

Tony O'Connor, head of menswear design, said he has drawn inspiration from stylish British icons such as the late Sir David Frost and former 007 Sir Roger Moore.

He has updated their 1970s looks for the modern M&S gent.

'These are classic pieces mixed in a more contemporary way,' he tells the Sunday Times.

He says his Best of British catwalk collection is full of 'that British-style swagger and suaveness. I wouldn't say it's a dandification, because dandy implies someone trying too hard.

'It's that underlying confidence in dressing well which has come back.'

The designer says men's tastes are 
influenced by stylish modern men like Gary Barlow, who wore an M&S 
Best of British suit on The X Factor, and Sir Bradley Wiggins, who 'has 
swagger'.

He says Best of British model Oliver Cheshire is 'the boy'.

'He captures that London elegance.'

For
 AW14, the firm say their design team has referenced archive collections
 for inspiration, creating timeless pieces which reference classic 
sartorial periods - but with today's gentleman at the forefront.

Every
 piece in the collection is carefully created with premium fabrics and 
hand finishes, emphasising British craftsmanship and quality. 

A luxurious, contemporary palette runs throughout, combining warm tones of chocolate brown, camel and taupe.

For the first time, eveningwear has been introduced into the collection. 

Debonair velvet tuxedo jackets and trousers in black and brown are cut in single and double breasted shapes. 

Outwear
 sees the addition of leather and suede jackets into the range alongside
 impeccably cut pieces from classic Crombie coats to double breasted 
styles with sheepskin collar detail.

Tailored suits cut a dashing silhouette in stripe and Prince of Wales check and were paired with coordinating ties. 

Formal jackets in bold weaves featured suede shoulder and elbow details while luxurious silk bow ties were paired with silk squares in graphic prints that were mixed and matched across the collection.

Knitwear is simple yet refined as shawl neck collared cable knits are created in the softest cashmere yarns - the ultimate in contemporary casualwear. 

Graphic knits nod to retro styles whilst soft knit polo necks create a simple, understated look with jackets or suits.

The Best of British Autumn/Winter collection is available in selected stores and online from October 2014.
