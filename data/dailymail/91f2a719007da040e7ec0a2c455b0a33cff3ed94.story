Washing and peeling potatoes for the Sunday roast can be a time-consuming task, especially if you have 1kg of potatoes to prepare.

However, one Danish man has found an ingenious solution to slash the time needed to peel the spuds using just a bucket, a hose, a drill and a toilet brush.

Leo Lund from Grasten came up with the idea to use the everyday household items so he could prepare the potatoes within just 50 seconds ready to be cooked.Â

Starting off with a 1kg bag of potatoes, left, Leo Lund tips them into a bucket, right, and lines up his drill, with a toilet brush attached and his hose

Mr Lund then places the drill brush inside the bucket, left, and then blasts the potatoes with the water from his hose

In a video, Mr Lund can be seen taking his large bag of unwashed and unpeeled potatoes and placing them in a bucket.

He then picks up a power drill, which he has attached a stiff toilet brush to the end of it.

Mr Lund then blasts the potatoes with the hose, while at the same time holding the drill with the brush attached inside the bucket.

The potatoes then go into a spin as the force of the drill and hose begin to wash and peel them

After a minute of the potatoes being spun, he then drains away the excess water ready to reveal the spuds

He then tips the potatoes, which have been cleaned and peeled into a pan ready to be cooked

He continues to hose down the spuds while using the drill brush to quickly peel them.

And less than a minute later, he pours out the excess water to reveal his washed and peeled potatoes, which he places into a pan.

Mr Lund then posted the video of his potato peeling on to his Facebook page and entitled his video, 'How to fix 1 kg of new potatoes ready for the pot in about 50 seconds, rather lazy than stupid.'

The footage has now gone viral on the social network already receiving more than 17,000 likes and being shared over 100,000 times since it was posted last week.
