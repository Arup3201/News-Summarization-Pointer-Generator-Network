The man with the dog tattoo tends to do things a little differently, which is probably why Bournemouth won’t roll over when Liverpool come to town this month.

‘It’s for Rodney,’ says Eddie Howe. One of the most upwardly mobile English managers is referring to the letter R inked on his right wrist.

‘It’s the only tattoo I have. He was the Labrador I had here when I moved away from home to be an apprentice. Some people don’t understand it.’

He laughs, but there are many things about this 37-year-old, who has taken charge of more than 300 games, that are not entirely conventional.

There are the text-message rituals he shares with the club’s Russian owner and the £3,000 he once took from his own pocket to get his players into shape.

There’s also his answer to the question of whether he would leave if a Premier League club approached him before the end of the season.

The 37-year-old, bellowing out instructions on the touchline, is passionate about the job at Bournemouth

‘I genuinely wouldn’t,’ he says. ‘I’m in a good place, with freedom and control and support from the owner. I have learnt that when you are in management there should be no rush — it’s easy to go wrong.

‘So long as we are progressing and I can work in these conditions, I have no desire to go anywhere.’

The truth is that Bournemouth and Howe are a good mixture.

It’s the club that nurtured him and whom he served for more than 300 games across two spells as a player, the second of which came after fans pledged £13,500 online to help buy him.

As a manager, either side of a stint at Burnley, he took the financially-crippled club from the foot of League Two in 2008 to fourth in the Championship today. They have done it playing passing, attacking football.

More still, they host Liverpool on December 17 in the quarter-final of the Capital One Cup, pitting Howe against Brendan Rodgers, the man he credits for so much of his education.

Howe played for Bournemouth during two spells, appearing over 300 times for the south coast side

‘If my memory is right, we first met when Swansea played Burnley way back in the Championship in 2011,’ Howe says.

‘We were fortunate because we beat Swansea but I was really impressed by him — not just his passion but the way his team played.

‘I rang him at some point after that and said, “Do you mind if I come in and watch you work?”

‘It might sound strange, coming from one Championship manager to another. I’ve only asked a few times about things like that and Brendan was the only one who opened the door.

‘They got promoted to the Premier League and that’s when I went in.’

He met Rodgers at the public health club where Swansea used to train.

Howe adds: ‘He had this tiny office. I took a lot from that meeting — the facilities weren’t what I was expecting. It proved the quality of the coaching is the most important thing.

Howe spent a day learning with Brendan Rodgers during the Liverpool manager's time as Swansea boss

‘He spent the whole day with me, sharing his views on life and football. What he said really stuck with me. He couldn’t emphasise enough how important it is to educate yourself as much as you can and his sessions were brilliant.

‘I learnt as much from that one day as I did from a huge time in management.

‘I will always be grateful to him and respect him for that. And if he wants to loan me Raheem Sterling or Daniel Sturridge, that would be nice, too.’

These are good times for Howe, who admits: ‘The thought of a cup quarter-final and contending to get in the Premier League is strange — I’ve been here a very long time and I know where we came from.’

Howe was a fans’ favourite as a defender for the club, having joined at 10 and risen through the age groups.

‘I did pre-season under Tony Pulis and that was brutal,’ he says.

Howe’s peak came when he won two England Under 21 caps at the Toulon Tournament in 1998.

‘I was the unknown guy from Bournemouth,’ he says. ‘There was Frank Lampard, Jamie Carragher, Emile Heskey — they were all Premier League. When I joined Portsmouth in 2002, I worked under Harry Redknapp. He really knows how to build a team.’

Howe was Redknapp’s first signing at Portsmouth, given his big chance in the Championship, but he badly injured his knee on his debut and from there it was tough.

He returned to Bournemouth in 2004 but the knee ultimately meant his retirement in 2007, aged 29.

After some time coaching at the club, his phone rang on New Year’s Eve, 2008. They had started the season with a 17-point deduction and Jimmy Quinn was sacked with the club deep in the relegation zone and broke.

‘I was at a party,’ Howe says. ‘I remember getting a phone call and going to the garden trying to get a signal. I was offered the job and the world sort of stopped spinning for me. I said yes instantly but I was asking myself, “What are you doing?”

‘I don’t think I would have ever had the opportunity elsewhere. My only chance was here, where I had this connection. But in your head you know if you are not successful in that first job you are on the scrapheap at 31. I was really worried about letting people down.’

The Football League’s youngest manager kept them in League Two, got promotion the next season and, after a 19-month stint at Championship club Burnley, returned following the unexpected death of his mother in October 2012.

He landed his second promotion that season. ‘There was simply no money when I first joined in 2009,’ Howe says.

‘We were literally 15 minutes from going out of business. Bailiffs were turning up, players weren’t getting paid.

The Cherries boss is a hero at Dean Court, with a Bournemouth fan using a Howe mask to celebrate 

‘I remember before we went up from League Two, I wanted a sport scientist for pre-season.

‘Jason (Tindall, his assistant) and I paid £3,000 for that from our own pockets. I didn’t tell my family.’

These days, under Russian millionaire Maxim Demin, motivational quotes from Abraham Lincoln to Michael Jordan line the stadium walls and finances are considerably healthier, even though Howe gets ‘quite annoyed’ when people say they have bought success in his second stint.

He adds: ‘You need money to reach this level and the owner has been great. But our wage bill is probably mid-Championship and our back four is the same as when we were bottom three in League One.’

Howe, celebrating during his playing days for Bournemouth, is also enjoying success as their manager

Today, they are top four in the Championship with the superstitious leaders of the club growing more twitchy.

Demin apparently opted against attending the win over West Brom in the Cup fourth round because he did not wish to ‘jinx’ the side, and Howe does not know if he will attend the game against Liverpool.

‘We have a few quite superstitious people here, myself included,’ Howe says. ‘I get to the ground at 10am before every home game and I have my way of setting certain things up.

‘Max and I also text each other about an hour and a half before a game. A few of the board have superstitions as well. It’s one of those things about professional sport — you learn to value luck.’

You would imagine Bournemouth have learned the value of a New Year’s Eve phone call, too.
