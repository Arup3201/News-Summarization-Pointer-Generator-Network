An Amber Alert has been issued for two children whose home was destroyed by an intense fire but their bodies never found.

Authorities in Unionville, Tennessee issued a state-wide alert for the half-brother and sister on Friday after spending a fifth unsuccessful day searching the fire's debris for any sign of their remains.

Police say Chloie Leverette, 9, and Gage Daniel, 7, were living with their grandparents at the house roughly 40 miles south of Nashville when it caught fire on Sunday night from causes currently unknown.

Missing: Gage Daniel, 7, and Chloie Leverette, 9, were believed inside their grandparents' home that caught fire last weekend but their bodies have not been found

Both of their grandparents perished in the flames that were at first believed to have engulfed the home while all four slept.

'The fact that we don't have sufficient evidence from fire investigators right now to positively conclude that they died in this fire, makes us want to make sure that they are not somewhere else,' Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Kristin Helm told ABC.

'I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think,' Christopher Daniel, Gage's father, told The Associated Press in a brief telephone interview. 'They don't think that they burned up in the fire, the way I took it they don't.'

Daniel, his voice breaking, said he had no idea what could have happened to the children, who have not been seen since before the fire on Sunday evening.

'Their mother has been spoken to, she does not have the children,' Helm said. 'There are other family members that we are looking to speak with today.'

Two bodies tentatively identified as 72-year-old Leon 'Bubba' McClaran and his wife, 70-year-old Molli McClaran, were recovered Monday and have been sent to the Nashville medical examiner's office for autopsy. She was the children's maternal grandmother, he their step-grandfather.

Helm said the alert has not been sent to other states having no indication they could be outside.

Multiple fire experts had processed the debris of the incinerated farmhouse and no trace of the children was found, the TBI said in a news release announcing the alert.

On Wednesday, when officials still had not found evidence of the children's remains in the debris, TBI issued an endangered child alert.

Investigation: Workers continue to sift through the debris for any sign of the children's bodies with no suspects or evidence of foul play reported

Helm said the TBI does not have any direct evidence that the children are victims of foul play.

She said there are no persons of interest in the case and that investigators are following all leads, but would not elaborate.

'In most of these situations, statistically, children this age, over 90 per cent of the time, are taken by their own parents or a close relative,' Former FBI Agent Brad Garrett told ABC.

The Associated Press reports that between 2006 and 2010 the Tennessee Department of Children's Services investigated the children's mother and Christopher Daniel.

Forensic teams from Middle Tennessee State University and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville were brought in to help in the search.

Forensic anthropologist Steven A. Symes, who formerly worked in the medical examiner's office for Shelby County, said it was a smart decision for authorities to bring in these teams because they have the expertise.

'It just takes some screening and some close looking and understanding that a piece of drywall and piece of skull bone burned look about identical,' he said.

Symes said the recovery of remains from fires has advanced as the forensic anthropology field grows, but he acknowledged it is still a slow process.

He said the length of time to recover remains depends on the scene and how detailed the search is.

'Unfortunately sometimes a case that you least expect to be suspicious or difficult turns into that type of case,' he said.

Christopher Garrett, a spokesman for the State Fire Marshal's office, said he did not have any information on a cause of the fire.
