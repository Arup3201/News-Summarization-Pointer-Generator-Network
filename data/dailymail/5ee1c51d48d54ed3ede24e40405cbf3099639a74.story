As pressure mounts for a last-minute deal to avoid across-the-board spending cuts, it became clear Tuesday that patience was running thin in the U.S. House of Representatives as Speaker John Boehner lambasted the Senate for not getting 'off their ass' to 'do something' about the looming Friday deadline.

Boehner made the terse remark as he complained to reporters that the House has twice passed bills that would replace the $85 billion in spending cuts, which are scheduled to kick in Friday, while the Senate has not acted.

'We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,' the Republican leader barked.

Obama wants to replace the sequester with a package of targeted cuts and tax increases, while Republican leaders believe the savings should come from reduced spending alone

Meanwhile, President Obama traveled to Virginia Tuesday to the state's largest industrial employer, Newport News Shipbuilding, to continue his campaign against the stalemate in Congress.

'You know that if Congress can’t get together and plan our nation’s finances for the long term, that over time some of your jobs and businesses could be at risk,' Obama told the company's employees in remarks that were staged in front of a giant ship propeller. Workers in hard hats were selected to from the crowd to stand around him. 

'Over at the Norfolk Naval Station, the threat of these cuts has already forced the Navy to cancel the deployment, or delay the repair of certain aircraft carriers,' Obama said. 'One that’s currently being built might not get finished. Another carrier might not get started at all. And that hurts your bottom line. That hurts this community.'

Joining Obama on Air Force One for the trip to Newport News were two Virginia congressmen, Democrat Bobby Scott and Republican Scott Rigell.

Obama gave Rigell a shout-out during his remarks, while at the same time, he blasted Republicans for 'holding up' negotiations on a deal to avert the sequester.

'I've got to give Scott Rigell credit,' Obama said. 'He is one of your Republican congressmen who’s with us here today - and that's not always healthy for a Republican, being with me.

'He’s asked his colleagues in the House to consider closing tax loopholes instead of letting these automatic cuts go through. He’s concerned about the deficit, and he’s more than prepared to make some really tough cuts, but he wants to do it in a smart way.'

'But,' Obama added, 'I just have to 
be honest with you. There are too many Republicans in Congress right now
 who refuse to compromise even an inch when it comes to closing tax 
loopholes and special interest tax breaks. And that's what's holding 
things up right now.'

Before Obama's remarks, Rigell said 
he expected to take heat from Republicans for appearing with the 
president at a public event.

'I boarded the plane knowing that some would potentially misinterpret this,' Rigell said. 

But
 he said he had to take 'the unique opportunity to speak directly to the
 commander in chief and to ask him respectfully but clearly to put forth
 a definitive alternative to sequestration.'

There has been no indication the White House and congressional Republicans are actively negotiating a deal.

The last known conversation between Obama and GOP leaders was last week, although the White House said the cuts would be among the topics discussed later Tuesday when Obama meets with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain.
