Two Idaho families were emotionally reunited over the weekend, after their dads got stuck in the snow overnight and then made their three brave children trek 19 miles in freezing conditions to find help.

William Murkle, 34, and his ten-year-old daughter Megun, went for a Saturday drive with John Julian, 38, and his children Isaac and Samantha, who are seven and eight.

When their SUV got stuck in deep snow at around 2.30pm near Lucky Peak the group was forced to shiver in the vehicle for the night, then set off at 8am on Sunday morning for a nine-hour trek.

The exhausted families finally arrived at an inhabited cabin in Prairie, where they called their concerned families for a ride home.

Tough Megun Murkle, of Boise, told NWCN: 'It was just a long journey, but fun and miserable.'

'I was also thinking, we can do this, we can do this, I just kept saying that in my head and we did it,' the ten-year-old continued.

William Murkle admitted that the group didn't have any food, water or warm clothes, but managed to keep their spirits high and even found an abandoned car with cookies inside that they ate.

And it wasn't just hunger and fierce cold that threatened the men and children in the mountains.

'The scariest thing was when we came across fresh wolf tracks,' Will Murkle told ABC. 'And we could tell wolves had been in the area recently.'

In happier times: The dads managed to keep spirits high during the cold trek. 'I came up with the 99 head of elk on the hill, so we sang that,' William Murkle said

The dad said he hasn't been put off going on winter rides with his friends and family but does say he'll ready for any eventuality next time.

'Never forget a winter coat, when you're even planning on not getting out of the vehicle during winter time,' he explained to KBOI. 'Definitely be more prepared for 'what ifs.''

While her family were in dire straits desperately worried mother Chaunte Murkle went out to look for her missing child and husband, and then began organizing a rescue effort.

'My heart told me they were okay and we just needed to find them, so I knew they were okay, you just let your mind take you to wild places you don't want to think of,' she explained.

And young Megun will never forget the moment that they found the cabin, ending the missing people case that had worried the entire area.

'The people were like, 'wait, are you those people on the TV?' and my dad was like, 'Wait, we're on TV?' the girl explained.
