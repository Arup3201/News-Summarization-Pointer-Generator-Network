Aldi could soon overtake Waitrose in market share as more middle class families choose to shop at the budget chain.

Sales at the German-owned discount store rose 32.2 per cent in the 12 weeks to July 20.

This means 4.8 per cent of shoppers now visit Aldi, up from 3.7 per cent this time last year and rapidly approaching Waitrose’s 4.9 per cent share.

German invasion: Budget supermarket Aldi now has 4.8 per cent of British food shoppers coming through their doors - up from 3.7 per cent last year

This means 4.8 per cent of Britain’s food shoppers now walk through its doors, up from  3.7 per cent this time last year and a hair’s breadth away from Waitrose, which commands 4.9 per cent of the market.

Edward Garner, a director at Kantar Worldpanel said: ‘Aldi’s 32 per cent growth rate has lifted its market share to 4.8 per cent; this is a new record for the retailer and means it has nearly caught up with Waitrose.’

Sainbury and Asda held on to their market share, recording growth of 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.

But the rise of the discounters has struck at the heart of the Big Four grocers. Aldi’s arch-rival Lidl, also German-owned, recorded sales growth of 19.5 per cent and saw its market share rise from 3.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent.

Tesco has been struggling to turn around its troubled UK chain and last week ditched chief executive Philip Clarke after the latest in a string of profit warnings.

The data also shows Tesco has suffered its worst sales decline in at least two decades, with a fall of  3.8pc.

That is its steepest decline since comparable records began in 1994.

Tesco’s market share fell to 28.9 per cent from 30.3 per cent a year ago, despite investing £1bn in cutting prices, improving service and staff numbers, and refreshing stores. 

The market has become polarised with the biggest growth found at the discounters and at the upper end, while the mid-market players have been squeezed.

Tesco and Morrisons have both been forced to respond by investing hundreds of millions of pounds in a price war.

Aldi’s joint managing director Roman Heini told the Mail he was glad he didn’t run Tesco: ‘I’m glad we don’t have huge complex beasts with online, banking, huge ranges and am thankful what we have is simple. This has enabled us to be close to the market.’

Joint managing director Matthew Barnes said: ‘This price war magnifies our offer. Everyone talks about narrowing the gap on Aldi, highlighting that we have the best offers.

‘Plus it spells out to shoppers that if they are only narrowing the gap it means that they don’t want to match us on price.’

Aldi has a finely-honed model, selling a limited range of 1,500 lines instead of the 40,000 stocked in the mainstream supermarkets, of which 90 per cent are own brand.

It stocks just three different types of olive oil compared with the 20 or so found in a Tesco.

Aldi’s olive oil buyer is able to know the supplier and the three products inside out because the range is so small.

Mr Barnes says: ‘This allows us to concentrate our efforts on making this product the best olive oil on the market. It also means we buy a higher volume (per line) than our competitors do. This allows us to offer incredible value to our customers.’

In a recent Daily Mail taste test Aldi’s olive oil at £2.69 for 500ml was given 10/10 compared to the 7/10 given to Waitrose’s extra virgin olive oil at £14.99 for 500ml.

It also uses checkouts that were developed and patented by its German parent, where the conveyor belts are longer to accommodate the entire contents of a trolley load. The items have bigger bar codes in three different positions which are more likely to be captured first time when scanned.

Aldi claims this enables customers to pass through the tills 40 per cent faster, meaning shorter queues.

Waiting times are also shortened because shoppers are not allowed to pack their bags at the tills – they have to reload their trolleys and bag up their items a shelf at the back of the store.

Kantar said its measure of price inflation for the industry fell to 0.4 per cent - the lowest level since its records began in October 2006. Overall market growth for the latest period fell to 0.9 per cent – the lowest figure for 10 years.
