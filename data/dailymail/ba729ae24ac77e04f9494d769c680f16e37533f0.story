A man who killed eight
people in the Western Canadian city of Edmonton this week spared
two babies who he dropped off with relatives before killing his
last victim and turning the murder weapon on himself.

Phu Lam, 53, fatally shot five adults and two children, ages
8 and 3, on Monday in a house that he co-owned with his
estranged wife, who was one of the victims, along with her
parents, sister and a family acquaintance.

He also killed
another woman in a different house in Edmonton before driving to
a town 30 kilometers (19 miles) northeast of the city, where he
shot himself in a Vietnamese restaurant.

Police said that Lam on Monday had dropped an 8-month-old
girl, a niece of his wife, Thuy Tien Truong, whom he had already
killed, and their 1-year-old son with a relative in Edmonton
before shooting the eighth victim, Cyndi Duong, later that day.

'There's a very good possibility that those children were in
the house ... when the homicides took place,' Edmonton Police
Superintendent Mark Neufeld said.

'And,
yes, for whatever reason, the children were spared.'

The murder-suicide made the mass killing the deadliest in
the history of the city, which was incorporated in 1904. Edmonton, population 878,000, recorded 27 homicides in 2013 and
27 in 2014 prior to the killings.

All the victims were members of the city's Vietnamese
community, which is among the largest in Canada.

While the police said the killings were a deliberate and
planned act, they said Duong was simply in the wrong place when 
Lam arrived looking for another person, whom they did not name.

As police released results of autopsies that confirmed all
the victims and Lam died of wounds from his stolen 9-mm handgun,
details emerged on the rocky relationship between Phu Lam and
his wife.

CBC News said his wife, Truong, asked an Alberta court for
an emergency protection order in November 2012 when Lam
threatened to kill her and her family upon learning that Elvis
Lam was not his son.

The order was granted but was not renewed when it expired in
January 2013. Elvis, 8, was among the victims.

The other child
killed, 3-year-old Valentina Nguyen, was the daughter of
33-year-old Thanh Ha Thi Truong, who was the sister of Thuy Tien
Truong.

The news service also said Lam was having financial
difficulties, filing for bankruptcy last February after running
up a debt of nearly $424,000.
