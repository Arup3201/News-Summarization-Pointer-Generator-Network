A man born without a penis has revealed he can finally feel positive about the future after being offered groundbreaking surgery where the genital part will be created from his own arm.

Andrew Wardle, 39, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, explained on today's This Morning he has 'learnt to live' with his condition but it has caused endless problems with his love life.

While he said he has never had any trouble getting girlfriends, he said some have been more understanding about his situation than others.

Born without a penis: Andrew Wardle, 39, shared his story on This Morning and revealed not all girlfriends have been understanding

He recalled some dates reacted with anger - and one even with violence - when he told them the truth about his body.

'It is difficult to explain to a new girlfriend but when I have some have been really nice about it,' he said. 'But I was punched in the face once when I told a girl. I guess she was angry as she felt like I had lied but it's not something you can say right away.'

Mr Wardle has hit headlines before because of his rare affliction. He explained how he was born  with an ectopic bladder, meaning
it formed on the outside of his body. Doctors were able to fix his bladder so he was able to pass urine but he never developed a penis.

Presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford asked him how he had coped as a school boy.

He said: 'As child it was easy, guys don't look
at each others private bits. I did get bullied a little as I was always in and out of hospital, people didn't know why I needed treatment but had an idea of area it was in.'

He explained how as he grew up it became 'second nature' to hide his problem and when he first began to develop sexual feeling towards women it wasn't a problem thanks to having a sympathetic first love.

He said: 'My first girlfriend was really nice and understanding. We went out for four years 
and it was not a problem. It may had been if we were together in the future but we were only 15 so it wasn't.'

Hope: Mr Wardle is happy with new girlfriend, Freida, right, and positive about surgery where a penis will be created from the skin on his arm

Despite his problem, Mr Wardle said he continued to have numerous girlfriends and his reluctance to jump into bed on the first date sometimes worked in his favour - as women were often delighted to be with a 'nice guy' who wanted to take the relationship slowly.

However, he also said he went through 'dark times' when he took drugs to forget about 'who he was'. But this only led to him becoming more depressed and he was once so low he made a suicide attempt.

But with the help of family, friends, and a new supportive girlfriend, Freida, he in now back on track.

He admitted he is finally feeling 
'positive' about the future as he is set to have a groundbreaking 
operation where a penis will be created from the skin in his arm.

This will then be 'wired up' to be fully functional.

There is a possibility he will one day be able to have children but he said he is yet to fully discuss this with surgeons at University College London who have agreed to carry out the complicated three-part operation.

'I've learnt to live with one but I owe it to myself to give it a go,' he said.
