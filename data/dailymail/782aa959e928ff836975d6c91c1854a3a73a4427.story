Romania's European qualifier with Hungary ended in a 1-1 draw, but the match was merely a side-note to the brutal violence both on and off the field. 

Scottish referee William Collum was forced to dish out 12 yellow cards during the match, while police sprayed tear gas at fans in the stands. 

Both sets of supporters created a deafening roar throughout the game, letting off flares and firecrackers, to the dismay of onlooking police.

Following Hungary's shock opening defeat to Northern Ireland, the players had funded their fans 1,200 tickets to the match in Bucharest, but as tempers boiled over police sprayed tear gas in an attempt to dampen the lively atmosphere.  

Hungarian forward Adam Szalai had a goal disallowed for offside six minutes before the break, causing visiting fans to set several seats on fire.

And to make matters worse, Raul Rusescu gave the hosts a deserved lead on the stroke of half-time, putting point-less Hungary under further pressure. 

To the relief of the visitors, Balazs Dzsudzsak fired a perfectly-executed free-kick into the back of the net just eight minutes from time, rescuing a point for Hungary.
