Run, don't walk, to the ice cream van this Saturday as the hottest weekend of the year is expected to see a rush on our summer favourites.

Ice lolly sales are due to be up by 150% on this time last year and sales of BBQ meat are predicted to rise by 30% on the previous year with a 25% increase on the past week.

Rather than being caught short, supermarkets like Marks and Spencer are preparing themselves for the onslaught of alfresco enthusiasts.

BBQ foods are set to sell-out this weekend as temperatures rise

Customers at M&S are expected to plough their way through over 700,000 burgers and almost 250,000 of M&S' popular  'posh dogs' sausages.

M&S bakers have their buns at the ready, baking more than 500,000 in preparation of the coming weekend.

Sales of picnic favourites are also set to rocket this coming weekend

Those of us who are a bit space 
restricted when it comes to BBQs needn't feel left out - the supermarket giant predicts that we 
will be fighting for the last patch of grass on the park lawn.

Picnic
 rugs are expected to land all over the UK with sales of the picnic staple
- quiche expected to be up by 70% compared to last week, and we will munch
 through almost 200,000 of M&S' sausage rolls.

An M&S spokesperson anticipates a flurry of customers who have been eager to make use of their neglected BBQs.

'With temperatures set to hit the early 20's, we're predicting this to be the first official BBQ weekend of the year so far. 

'We know our customers have been itching to dust off their BBQ's and picnic mats, so we are stocking up our shelves with delicious burgers, sausages and picnic treats to ensure we keep up with demand.'

The warmer weather is set to see us ditch our heavy Merlots for a lighter drink choice. M&S predicts rose sales will increase 50% compared to the last week.

The lazier drinkers amongst us looking for a convenient tipple are expected to help in tripling the sales of pre-mixed cocktails, with M&S being the first supermarket to launch the pre-mixed Negroni, an Italian cocktail made from gin and vermouth.

Sales of this drink are expected to increase five-fold at the weekend as customers aim to impress their friends with the latest drinks craze. 

This weekend is set to see some of the sunniest weather of the year
