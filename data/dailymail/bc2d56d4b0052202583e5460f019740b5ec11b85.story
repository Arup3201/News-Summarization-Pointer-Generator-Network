AFL legend Neale Daniher, who played for Essendon in the 1980s and coached Melbourne for nearly a decade, has revealed his with fight motor neurone disease.

Daniher, a 53-year-old father of four, was diagnosed with the deadly condition last year but has finally decided to make it public.

The former Bombers captain told Seven News he's come to terms with the difficult reality that he's dying.

'No prevention, no cure, no treatment,' he said.

Daniher told Seven News that he will spend the next few months educating the public about the disease and encouraging high-profile AFL players to help tell his story.

Motor neurone disease (MND) slowly attacks the nervous system, until the use of arms, legs and ability to speak, swallow and breathe are gone. Its causes are still unknown.

Daniher first realised there was a problem when he experienced trouble hanging out his washing. He went for tests, assuming there would a simple fix.

'Modern science. A few ­injections. A few tablets. Nothing serious. I’ll be back putting clothes on the line again,' Daniher explained.

But after nine months he was finally diagnosed with MND. Still currently living an active life, Daniher says the worst past of the debilitating disease is that it does not affect one's mental ability.

'A tragedy of the disease is you’re a witness to your body dying,' he said.

But the former coach, who took charge of 223 games for Melbourne between 1998 and 2007, says he plans to make the most of all the time he has left.

'You don’t cope by fear. You just day-by-day exist,' he said. 'You just get on with life and enjoy life and there’s a lot to enjoy.

'And you don’t cope by thinking where this will end up? There’s no fun in that. You don’t get many laughs in that.'

Journalists and football teams have taken to Twitter to pay tribute to Daniher.

Daniher has announced his retirement from West Coast Eagles as football operations boss and has made plans to move back to Melbourne with his family.

His aim is to help find a cure for this silent killer.

'Most of the (research) funding has to be donations or bequests, so I have got to get involved, because we need to find a cure for the next generation,' Mr Daniher said.

'It is an anonymous killer, and we have some fine researchers out there working away but they are underfunded - so I will try to help.'

Daniher's interview is set to air tonight on Seven News.
