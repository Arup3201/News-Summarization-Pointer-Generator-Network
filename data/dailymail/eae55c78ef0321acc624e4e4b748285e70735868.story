England's Ross Fisher faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a European Tour title for the first time in his career in this week's Tshwane Open.

Fisher ended a four-year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at The Els Club at Copperleaf, which, at 7,964 yards, was the longest course in European Tour history.

This year the tournament, which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour this season, has been switched to Pretoria Country Club, which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par-five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours, making it a par 70.

Ross Fisher says it will be tough for him at the Tshwane Open this year but that he is looking forward to it

'It's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly,' said Fisher of the course, which was redesigned in 2004 by Gary Player, who calls it a 'hidden gem'.

'There will be a lot of positional play off the tee, a lot of irons and not many drivers.

'It's an adaptation that we have to make as players. We don't generally play these types of golf courses.

'It's very different and I would prefer to be on a long golf course that's quite tight, because driving is my strength.

'It's going to be different this week. Your wedges will have to be sharp and you're going to have to get a hot putter, because I can imagine the scoring will be pretty good with some quality players here this week.

'I'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that.'

Compatriot Andy Sullivan missed the cut in the Africa Open last week but is looking for his third win in South Africa in the space of 10 weeks, while home favourite George Coetzee has the benefit of local knowledge.

Pretoria native Coetzee has been a member of the club since he took up the sport and won his first tournament here at the age of 10.

'I didn't build my game at this golf course,' Coetzee said. 'I putted well to shoot good scores here, but it's a drawer's golf course. There is a lot of risk and reward and on a lot of holes you can take it on.

'There are some advantages to knowing the course as well as I do, but it suits a certain type of golfer. Hopefully I make enough putts to make up for that.

'I guess there's probably a little bit of extra pressure but hopefully I will thrive on it this week.

'I've got a couple of tricks that I know the course likes to throw at you and hopefully I'll use them to my advantage.'

Compatriot Trevor Fisher Jnr comes into the event on the back of winning his first European Tour title at East London last week, a win which proved highly popular.

'It's been overwhelming,' Fisher Jnr said. 'All the messages and support, it's something special. I'm still busy soaking it in and looking forward to this week as well.'
