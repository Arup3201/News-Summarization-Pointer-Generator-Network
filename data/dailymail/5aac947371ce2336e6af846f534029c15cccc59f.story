Brian McDermott’s Elland Road future 
looks more uncertain than ever after Leeds United appointed Benito 
Carbone as director of football.

Carbone tweeted that his full official title is 'special consultant to the board of directors for sport matters including facilities and academy.'

Sportsmail revealed last month how former Sheffield Wednesday forward 
Carbone had been shown round Leeds’ Wetherby training ground after being
 lined up by owner Massimo Cellino to take over as manager.

All smiles: Despite being appointed as a director of football, Carbone has been lined up to take over McDemott

Bad blood: Leeds owner Massimo Celino (right) has held talks to terminate McDermott's (right) contract

Talks
 to terminate McDermott’s contract have failed to reach an agreement, 
however, with the former Reading boss due £1million in compensation if 
he is sacked and Cellino reluctant to pay it after describing Leeds’ 
finances as ‘alarming’.

With
 Carbone left in limbo, as the negotiations dragged on, Cellino finally 
decided to act by making him ‘special consultant to the board’, 
effectively technical director.

It
 would appear to be a question of how much longer McDermott holds out 
before accepting a cut-price settlement, particularly with other jobs 
becoming available. West Brom are evidently showing an interest in him 
after sacking Pepe Mel.

It 
is difficult to imagine him still being in charge of Leeds at the start 
of next season, after Cellino criticised his decision to go on holiday 
and added that the club was ‘not managed by anyone’ at the moment.

Cellino
 invited Carbone over to Leeds last month after the ex-Wednesday, Aston 
Villa and Bradford City forward made a bright start to his managerial 
career in Italy’s second division and made it clear he was eager to test
 himself in English football.

Fired: West Brom have shown interest in McDermott being their new manager following Pepe Mel's sacking

A
 frequent visitor to Barclays Premier League and Championship games to 
study coaching methods, Carbone, who can converse in English, insisted 
he was ready for a fresh challenge in this country.

They
 don’t come much bigger than trying to turn round Leeds’ fortunes, after
 more than a decade of decline and internal strife, but he could get his
 wish soon. If McDermott does finally accept the inevitable, Cellino is 
expected to turn to Carbone to take over as manager.
