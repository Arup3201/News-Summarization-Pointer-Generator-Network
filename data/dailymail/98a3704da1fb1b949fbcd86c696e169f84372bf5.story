Kick back, relax and put those feet up because September is the least stressful month of the year.

That is the word from researchers who warn Brits to make the most of it from Monday, before the high-pressure winter months draw in.

Researchers said worries about paying for Christmas and the fun of the festive season coming to an end made January the most stressful month.

Kick back and relax: September is the least stressful month of the year, according to new research

However, it also seems that while temperatures drop, stress levels rise, with December and February following closely behind.Â 

Less than one per cent in a poll of 2,000 adults chose September, which begins on Monday, when asked which month they believe is the most stressful.

Researchers also asked which was was the most stressful season and discovered that spring was voted as causing the lowest stress levels, followed by autumn.

However, winter is the most stress-inducing season, according to two-thirds of those polled.

David Williams, director of group protection at Friends Life, who did the research, said: 'The seasons can affect staff mood levels quite considerably, and it is important that employers are aware of this.

'While January often brings a post-festive season lull, if staff are relaxed when it comes to September it could be a good time to introduce positive changes to the workplace or launch a new project.

'Christmas clearly affects a lot people's anxiety levels. Finding money for presents and working out which relatives to see can all add up.

'Employers need to be tuned in to the turn of mood and if possible look at reducing the workload to improve well-being.

'It's difficult to know exactly why September is viewed as the least stressful month, but perhaps we are more relaxed after some good summer weather, a holiday and knowing the children are going back to school.'

The study also revealed that money was the top cause of stress, with 36 per cent of people saying it was their biggest worry.

Meanwhile almost one in five people chose work worries as the main cause.

The findings also suggested that young adults are the more likely to buckle under stress with almost one in four 18 to 24-year-olds calling in sick due to stress.
