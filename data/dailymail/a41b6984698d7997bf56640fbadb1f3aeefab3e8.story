'On behalf of everyone at Liverpool Football Club, the directors, players and staff, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to you and your family following the loss of your granddad Roy.

'As one of our supporters and a season ticket holder for many years, Roy is part of our LFC family and always will be.

'Nothing we say will recompense your loss but I extend my deepest sympathies and I want you to know that all our thoughts are with you and your family at this sad time.
