A time-lapse video of an mysterious optical phenomenon captured by Eric Sterman is certain to leave his fellow photographers green with envy.

Sterman was making a video of a Hawaii sunset on the north shore of Oahu about two weeks ago when his Panasonic GH4 camera caught a rare green flash.

The time-lapse footage depicts the sun descending from a bank of dark clouds and gradually dipping into the ocean as a pod of whales jump out of the water.

Just before the sun entirely vanishes below the horizon, a sliver of the ocean surface and the darkening sky are illuminated green for a brief moment.

The green flash was captured as the sunset on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii, by Eric Sterman

The seldom seen green flash occurs just before the last part of the sun disappears from view at the end of the 15 second clip.

According to NASA, the almost-mythic spectacle is caused by the atmospheric bending and scattering of sunlight.

Acting like a prism, the atmosphere of the Earth breaks white sunlight into individual colors, bending red colors slightly, and green and blue hues through increasingly larger angles.

A pod of breaching whales are also captured in the 15 second time lapse footage as the sunsets

On a clear day, a lucky observer can catch a glimpse of a green glint just above the sun's edge for a split second. 

The phenomenon, which lasts only a few second, can also occur at sunrise.
