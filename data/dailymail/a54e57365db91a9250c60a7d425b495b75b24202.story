She has been labelled one of ‘Cameron’s Cuties’, posed for Vanity Fair and won the title of sexiest female parliamentarian.

But if Tory MP Penny Mordaunt has any concerns about being taken seriously, she should perhaps have thought twice before diving into her latest publicity stunt.

The MP for Portsmouth North is to strip down to her swimsuit to take part in ITV game show Splash!

Splash! Tory MP Penny Mordaunt is swapping the House of Commons for the diving board to take part in the ITV reality show

Getting the practice in: The MP for Portsmouth North will appear 
on ITV’s reality show in only her swim suit later this month after being
 trained by Tom Daley

The 40-year-old will appear on Tom 
Daley’s Saturday night diving competition from next weekend. She plans 
to donate her fee to help renovate a local lido, and to several Armed 
Forces charities.

Miss 
Mordaunt, who is parliamentary private secretary to defence secretary 
Philip Hammond, will compete against musician Paul Young, model Danielle
 Lloyd, comedian Patrick Monahan and The Only Way is Essex star Dan 
Osborne.

Her participation drew criticism from the man who is due to challenge her at the next general election.

Labour’s
 John Ferrett tweeted: ‘Truly astonishing. Whilst workers rallying to 
save 1,000 jobs, their MP has been training for celebrity game show.’ He
 was referring to the threat to around 940 jobs as a result of a 
decision by BAE Systems to move shipbuilding to Scotland.

In the show celebrities compete in a knockout competition to impress three judges and the viewers with their high diving skills.

Miss
 Mordaunt, a former magician's assistant and Royal Navy reservist, will be hoping to avoid the fate of TOWIE star Gemma Collins 
who suffered a heavily bruised chest after taking part in the show on 
Saturday.

Miss Mordaunt 
said: ‘I have the elegance and drive of a paving slab, but my navy 
training has certainly given me the guts to take on the challenge head 
on.

‘Not only is Splash! a great personal development experience but it also seemed like the perfect way to fund raise for a charity I'm very passionate about - the Hilsea Lido in Portsmouth which is being renovated by the community.

‘I will be donating my fee for the programme to assist with the renovations.’

Ms Mordaunt, who spoke at Prime 
Minister's Questions as her participation in the show was being 
announced by ITV, once topped a website poll of the sexiest female MPs.

Also taking part in her heat on January 18 will be comedian Patrick Monahan and The Only Way Is Essex's Dan Osbourne.

Singer
 Paul Young said ‘It was only once I started training for the show that I
 realised I had a fear of heights, but, being the oldest contestant on 
the show, it really is now or never!’

Miss Mordaunt is the latest politician to agree to take part in a reality TV show to raise their profile.

Fellow
 Conservative Nadine Dorries landed herself in hot water when she jetted
 off to the Australian jungle to take part in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me 
Out Of Here.

Former Lib Dem MP Julia Goldsworthy raised her profile in 2006 when she took part in Channel 4’s The Games.

First
 elected as an MP in 2010, Miss Mordaunt, lists ‘amateur astronomer’ 
among her interests on her Twitter profile which is bound to unleash 
gags about heavenly bodies in anticipation of her appearance. 

Ouch! The Only Way Is Essex Gemma Collins suffered a heavily bruised chest after taking part in Saturday's first heat

Heats: Ex-Boyzone star Keith Duffy and TV presenter Anna Williamson will appear on Splash! this weekend

Stars: In the first show of the new series, Olympic diver Tom Daley (centre) coached contestants were (left to right) dancer Perri Kiely, TOWIE star Gemma Collins, presenter Michaela Strachan ex-Eastender, Ricky Groves and Gemma Merna from Hollyoaks

Other contestants on this second series of the contest have spoken about their fears of being seen in their swimsuits on TV.

Singer and actress Toyah Willcox, who takes part this weekend, has said: ‘I've never been seen in public in a bikini before, and I feel rather disturbed about the prospect.’

And wildlife presenter Michaela Strachan, who won a place in the semi-final after taking part on Saturday, said that appearing in such a skimpy outfit was more horrifying than being hurt during the dives.
