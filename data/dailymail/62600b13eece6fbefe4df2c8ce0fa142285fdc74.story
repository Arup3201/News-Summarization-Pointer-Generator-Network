FA chairman Greg Dyke has called for a public debate between the four candidates for the FIFA presidency and offered to host the event at Wembley.

Dyke made his wish for a TV inquisition known during an awkward weekend in Sepp Blatter’s company at the rules-deciding IFAB meeting in Belfast. The FA have made clear their strong opposition to the FIFA president serving a fifth term.

Meanwhile, in a separate move, Sky and the BBC have made a joint approach to Blatter and rivals Prince Ali of Jordan, Luis Figo and Michael van Praag to stage such an event.

FA chairman Greg Dyke has called for a public debate between the four candidates for the FIFA presidency

The TV networks — through leading sports news broadcasters Paul Kelso and Richard Conway — have written to the contestants outlining their ambitious proposals for a live, hour-long debate in the UK with an audience of fans representing all 209 FIFA member nations.

This fans’ congress would provide questions, with others drawn from football supporters via the Sky and BBC websites, and Facebook, to ensure maximum interaction.

All four challengers have been promised equal time and emphasis to present their manifestos and visions for FIFA’s future. Blatter has yet to respond to the Sky-BBC letter but it is highly unlikely he’ll agree to such public exposure. His three opponents will all be in favour.

The official photo of the IFAB summit shows Greg Dyke seated between, of all people, Sepp Blatter and Thailand’s Worawi Makudi, whose presence at Belfast’s Cullodon Hotel as a representative of the Asian Football Confederation was bizarre in the extreme. Makudi has an acrimonious history with the FA and is under investigation by FIFA’s ethics committee for breaching World Cup bid rules. It’s understood Makudi played no part in the rules debate. FIFA said Makudi was selected by the AFC to attend and is innocent of any code violations until found guilty.

The home nations are in disagreement as to whose turn it is to take the FIFA British vice-presidency

The 2011 gentlemen’s agreement between the four home nations, which declares it is Wales’s turn to take the FIFA British vice-presidency, continues to cause ructions.

The three other countries believe the agreement was nullified by a new statute that has all UEFA associations involved in the vote at the Congress later this month.

But Welsh president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes says he has a signed contract in his possession that declares no change can be made in the rotation pledge unless there is unanimous agreement.

Meanwhile, England’s David Gill, persuaded by UEFA president Michel Platini to stand for that FIFA place against Lloyd-Hughes, has written to all UEFA countries outlining his plans.

To spice up their battle, Wales are still annoyed that a UEFA ExCo, including Gill, voted for Hampden Park over the Millennium Stadium as one of 13 venues to stage Euro 2020. It’s believed Gill rated the Cardiff venue higher.

General secretary Alex Horne left the FA at the end of January but has not yet been replaced

Greg Dyke and David Gill, who are on the nominations panel choosing the FA’s next chief executive, were coy over the weekend about how far they have progressed in finding general secretary Alex Horne’s replacement. However, it’s understood the selection has been made after final interviews last week and an announcement is imminent.

Zimbabwe's Sean Williams celebrates taking the wicket of Umar Akmal during their World Cup match

BBC ON STICKY WICKET

BBC Sport’s live text reporting of Pakistan’s World Cup victory over Zimbabwe seems to have relied heavily on rival website Cricinfo.

Umar Akmal’s dismissal, bowled by Sean Williams, was described in the following way on Cricinfo: ‘Akmal made it look an even better delivery than it actually was, because he had moved inside the line and was trying to push that inside-out through cover.’

The licence-fee-funded BBC, who had just changed commentators, wrote: ‘Akmal made it look an even better delivery than it actually was, because he had moved inside the line and was trying to push that inside out through cover.’ Exactly the same. A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘The line should have been credited. This was a simple human error.’

The post-11pm peak viewing audience of two million on ITV for the Carl Frampton fight on Saturday has left the network intent on showing more live boxing.
