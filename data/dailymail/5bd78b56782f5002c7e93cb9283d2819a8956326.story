A woman living on benefits in a housing association block today said she had every right to spend taxpayer money on luxuries such as cigarettes, Sky TV and alcohol.

Tracey Macdonald, who has a 16-year-old daughter, said she had been 'brought up' to expect her lifestyle to be bankrolled by the state.

She spoke out after her housing association landlord urged tenants to change their lifestyles in order to keep their homes following cuts to benefits.

Speaking to ITV's Daybreak she said: 'We get our benefits and we should be able to spend them on what we choose to.'

Tracey MacDonald says the suggestion that benefit claiments cut back on extras is outrageous, and that they should be able to do what they want with the money

When Lorraine Kelly asks what Tracey would change if she had to make savings, Tracey said she wouldn't want to cut back on anything

Eastland Homes issued a newsletter advising tenants to cutback on satellite television and cigarettes in preparation for benefit cuts when the bedroom tax is introduced

'I get £142 a fortnight. I buy my cigarettes, a drink at weekends, shopping, and various things to economise.. I think it's outrageous [to suggest we change spending habits].

‘I wouldn't want to stop doing anything really, it's the way
 I've been brought up - to spend my benefits on what I'm used to, to 
survive.’

Asked what she would say to people who have jobs and work long hours but still can’t afford luxuries, Tracey, from Manchester replied: 'Well that's their choice isn't it? Like it's our choice to do what we're doing.'

Questioned if she could understand why some people might be angered by her point of view, she smiled and shrugged her shoulders, saying: 'Yeah, but so what? Each to their own isn't it.'

Ruth Porter from the Institute of Economic Affairs says we need to talk more about the need to budget

The Eastlands Housing Association advert suggested that residents living in 8,000 former council homes should start budgeting properly if hit by new cuts in housing benefit.

The association asked its tenants: ‘Can you really afford Sky, cigarettes, bingo, drinks and other non-essentials?'

It added: ‘If your benefit is being cut and you want to keep your home, you have to make up the difference.

‘Non-essential items won’t matter if you lose your home. Start budgeting now – we can help you do this, call us!’

The association was later forced to apologise after it was accused of being ‘deeply patronising’

Many residents, like Tracey, who living in the association’s properties across Manchester were furious at the letter.

One of them, Julie Deal, said: ‘It is contemptible. Many of their residents don’t sit around on benefits.

'It is deeply patronising. Talk about stereotyping those who live in former council homes. They should be ashamed.’

Others
 took to social media sites to voice their discontent, accusing Eastland
 Holmes on Twitter and Facebook of being 'idiots' and saying they should
 'be ashamed.'

Sheila 
Doran, chief executive of Eastland Homes in Manchester, insisted the 
advice in the latest issue of its Streets Ahead newsletter was intended 
to help its tenants prepare.

Lorraine Kelly asked if Tracey could understand why people who had to work 'all hours of the day' might be angry with those who spent benefits on non essentials

The newsletter received an angry response online among Twitter users who criticised Eastlands Homes

Tenants took to Facebook to vent their fury at the newsletter which was described as 'patronising'

‘We are concerned that some of our customers will be living “hand to mouth” as a result of the benefit cuts,’ she said.

‘Their quality of life will be significantly reduced and they face stark choices.

‘With
 benefit levels frozen and escalating fuel bills, there is a risk of 
families falling into arrears and losing their homes –  we don’t want to
 see that.

'We will provide
 as much support as possible and that includes giving advice on 
household budgeting, as requested by many of our customers.’

In
 a statement Eastlands Homes responded: ‘Our message is that we are here
 to help wherever possible and we’re sorry if we worded that clumsily.’

Eastlands homes housing association issued an apology over the newsletter which they admit was worded 'clumsily'

Residents of association housing like Dorothy Cooper (right), who has lived in her house for 53 years, and Vicky Ankers, pictured left with her daughter Rubyleigh, reacted with anger to the newsletter

Ruth Porter from the Institute of Economic Affairs, who appeared on Daybreak after Tracey said the budgeting advice from Eastlands Homes was ‘commendable’.

She explained: ‘I think the housing 
association in this situation was right to apologise probably for the 
wording which was slightly careless, but the basic idea that we need to 
look more carefully at how we budget, and we need to talk more as a 
society about it, I think is actually quite a sensible thing to put out 
there.

‘And the fact that 
the housing association was saying look, you're about to find that the 
amount of money that you've got to survive on is going to be squeezed, 
and we're happy to give you budgeting advice, I think was actually a 
very commendable thing.’
