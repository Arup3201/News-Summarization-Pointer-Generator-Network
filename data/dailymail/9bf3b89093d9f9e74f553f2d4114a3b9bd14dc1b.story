Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: 'This weekend sees the start of the main holiday exodus. While a favourable exchange rate in many destinations will increase the appeal of overseas holidays, we also expect the warm summer weather we've recently experienced to make the UK popular for late bookers.'

Transport information company Inrix said the first major jams of the school holiday period will be on Friday, with the five Saturdays that follow that the most congested days.

Inrix said hour-long journeys on Friday could take up to 90 minutes.

Research from Kwik-Fit shows that British families will rack up a total of 15.7 billion miles in their own cars during holidays this year.
