Covering their faces to conceal their identity, these Syrian men show appalling injuries they claim were inflicted on them by the country's security forces.

All five men have undergone reconstructive surgeries at Red Crescent Hospital in Amman.

The horrific images of their injuries were taken today and show the human cost of President Bashar Assad's ongoing brutal military crackdown against opposition.

Doctors said they are treating dozens of young Syrians injured during the violence at a hospital run by Paris-based Medecins Sans Frontieres in Amman.

 Syrian forces spent another day continuing to rain bombs on the city of
 Homs - the day after another 23 civilians were killed.

Tanks fired rockets on two large Sunni Muslim neighbourhoods this morning, as attacks carried on into a second week.

The continued bloodshed led Arab League foreign ministers to pledge for the first time to aid the 
opposition 'with all forms of political and material support' to overthrow Assad.

And
 British Foreign Secretary William Hague said plans to send a joint UN 
and League peacekeeping force in to Syria, once Assad stops his 
crackdown, must be discussed 'urgently'.

At yesterday's meeting in Cairo, 
Arab League foreign ministers vowed to aid the 
opposition battling to overthrow Assad and called on the UN 
Security Council to authorise a peacekeeping force.

They approved a resolution calling for 'opening communication channels with the 
Syrian opposition and providing all forms of political and material 
support to it'.

Horrific: The images show the human cost of President Bashar Assad's ongoing brutal military crackdown against opposition

It is seen 
as a remarkable statement from a body, which has turned against Assad 
because of its resentment of his ties to Iran, which was once known for 
keeping out of the internal affairs of its members.

It is not clear whether its proposed joint U.N.-Arab 
peacekeeping force would involve armed troops, or whether the aid 
offered to the opposition would include weapons.        

If
 so, it would be the second time in less than a year the Arab League had
 called for outside intervention in an Arab state.

Its decision to back a
 no-fly zone in Libya last March led to Western bombing that helped 
bring down Muammar Gaddafi.

William Hague, speaking after yesterday's meeting, said he welcomed the formation of the Group of Friends of Syria, which is expected to include exiled opposition leaders.

He said: 'Such a mission could have 
an important role to play in saving lives, providing the Assad regime 
ends the violence against civilians, withdraws its forces from towns and
 cities and establishes a credible ceasefire.'

He
 added that 'significant steps' were taken at the meeting to increase 
the 'diplomatic and economic isolation' faced by the Syrian regime.

And
 he said the UK would play a 'very active part' in the new Group of 
Friends of Syria, which has been established to increase political and 
financial support to opposition leaders in Syria. The group will meet 
again on February 24.

Mr 
Hague added: 'President Assad must be in no doubt of the determination 
of his neighbours and the international community to bring an end to the
 violence in Syria.

'The 
Arab League could not have sent a clearer message to Syria than the one 
it sent yesterday and we look forward to working closely with them in 
the coming days and weeks.'

And he added today that any peacekeeping troops in Syria should come from non-Western countries.   

He
 said: 'I don’t see the way forward in Syria as being Western boots on 
the ground in any form, including in any peacekeeping form.

'I
 think they would need to come from other countries, rather than Western
 nations. Of course, if such a concept can be made viable, we will be 
supporting it in all the usual ways.'

In Homs yesterday, government troops concentrated their fire on Baba Amro in the south of the city and al-Waer in the West, which borders the Military College, a main assembly point for tanks and government troops, opposition campaigners said.         

Activist Mohammad al-Hassan said: 'Tank shelling has been non-stop on Baba Amro and the bombardment on al-Wear began overnight.'

He
 said al-Waer, scene of large pro-democracy demonstrations for months, 
had come under attack in the last several days from pro-Assad militia 
known as shabbiha. 

And he
 added: 'We heard the Free Syrian Army has started responding by 
attacking roadblocks being manned by shabbiha. Communications with 
al-Waer have been cut off and the sound of shelling can be now heard.'

The Free Syrian Army, led by defectors, has taken the main role in armed opposition to Assad's government.     

Syria's
 uprising, in which the United Nations says more than 5,000 people have 
died, has become one of the bloodiest of the Arab Spring revolts 
sweeping the region since the end of 2010.     

Any
 peacekeeping mission would require consensus from foreign powers, who 
have been divided on how to resolve a conflict that is descending into a
 civil war.

Moscow and Beijing drew strong 
criticism from the West after they prevented the Security Council from 
backing an Arab plan that called for Assad to give up his powers.

However,
 Western powers so far have shown no appetite for military action, 
despite their condemnation of the repression of the uprising.

Syria called the League's resolution 
'a flagrant departure from the group's charter and a hostile act that 
targets Syria's security and stability'.

Assad's
 government says it is fighting an insurgency by militants funded from 
abroad, and Arab states have turned against it as part of a regional 
power grab.            

At 
the UN, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesperson said he supported 
the 'efforts of the League of Arab States to stop the violence in Syria 
and to seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis that meets the 
democratic and legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people'.

Earlier
 yesterday, Tunisia said it would host the first meeting on February 24 
of a 'Friends of Syria' contact group made up of Arab and other states 
and backed by the West.

A similar Libya contact group played a
 vital role in coordinating Western and Arab aid to that country's 
rebels last year.
