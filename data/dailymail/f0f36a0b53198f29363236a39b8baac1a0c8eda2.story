Pregnant Josie Cunningham has revealed how she was tricked for 18 months into believing the father of her baby was Premier League footballer Curtis Davies.

The wannabe glamour model, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, claims she was 'manipulated' into having a relationship with a man who pretended to be the Hull City star.

Just hours before going into labour, the 24-year-old told her 55,000 Twitter followers she had been 'physically fooled' by the imposter - despite searching images of the player on Google when she was warned the man could be a fraud.

Josie posted numerous tweets, as well as a four-page letter, explaining what had happened 

The 24-year-old made the revelation to her 55,000 Twitter followers, saying she felt 'dirty, ashamed and devastated' after finding out the truth

Posting four pages about the situation on Twitter, she wrote: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer.

'I feel physically fooled by him and had sex with someone who claimed to be someone he wasn't.

'I let a conman put his hands on me, kiss me with his lips and fill my head with lies.'

Josie, from Leeds, described how she met the young man in a hotel in Leicester in April last year and started sleeping with him soon after - but he turned out to 'just be a lookalike'. 

He had first made contact with her after she had appeared on the front page of a national newspaper and sent her a photo of Curtis Davies, which he had taken from the internet.  

She continued: 'I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a kick from thinking a Premiership footballer was interested in me.

'I've been called a liar for months and I've had my head held high thinking the whole country was wrong — when it was really me. I've stayed in hotels with him and I've poured my heart out to him.'

She went on to explain in a further Tweet that the couple were not in a 'full-blown relationship' which is how he managed to keep up the guise, adding 'I know I'm not that clever'. 

Her agent Rob Cooper told The Sun said: 'She's been suffering with stress over this whole Curtis Davies thing. She's in bits about it. But hopefully she'll be OK.'

Mr Davies, 29, who signed for the club last year, lives with his girlfriend Laura Dearn, 25.

There is no suggestion he has been involved with Josie. Hull City declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. MailOnline has also contacted his agent for comment. 

She made the announcement as she went in labour, where she is expecting to give birth to a girl 

The controversial mother-of-two, who met the imposter in April last year, said she felt 'physically sick' having to make the admission 

She reassured followers that she 'of course' Googled Curtis Davies, but was still tricked into believing he was the Hull City FC captain

The revelation is the latest episode in what has been an ongoing drama since Josie revealed she was pregnant.

Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her unborn daughter's boob job. 

Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery.

But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. 

Josie sent several tweets explaining the situation, adding: 'I know I'm not that clever'

She tweeted: 'Getting bored of people being horrible at every opportunity. When I discovered I was having a girl & cancelling the tickets (cont)- I made sure I had a way of getting the £4,800 back to the NHS for my boob job, because I knew people would bang on about that forever. 

'HOWEVER, considering 80% of the country are against me, i'll have the £4800 put in a trust fund for my little girl when she's 18 so she can have a boob job. Job done! #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1'.

The mother-of-two had been devastated when doctors told her she was having a third boy.

She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child.

Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. 

There is no suggestion Curtis Davies has had any involvement with Josie Cunningham

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. 

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. 

But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl. 

She had asked for a second opinion after using a home scan kit which said she was expecting a girl.

Central defender Curis Davies, 29, from Leytonstone, London, was signed by Hull City from Birmingham City in 2013 for £2,250,000.

In May 2014, he was named as Player of The Year.  

The 6ft 2in star has also played for Leicester, Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and Luton Town, where he began his career in 2003.

Davies represented England under-21s for the first time in February 2006 and went on to be capped three times at that level.

He was named in Fabio Capello's first provisional England squad. He has since been named in other England squads but has yet to make his full debut. 

She said: 'I want to enjoy my precious first few moments alone with my daughter and my mum - not share them with the world.

'I've really started looking after myself. I have never purposely put my child at any risk, but when I was originally told I was having a boy I just lost all willpower to avoid cravings.

'I've now cut down to just one or two fags a day. I'm about to get hypnotherapy to stop completely.'  

Josie became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. 

She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.
