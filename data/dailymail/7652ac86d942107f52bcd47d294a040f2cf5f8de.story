An artist strapped a video camera to a hula-hoop and pressed record - the result was a dizzy video which has gone viral on the internet.

In the five-minute clip dozens of scantily clad women can be seen dancing at this month's Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert.

Creator Rob Vokel, from California, said: 'This started with a simple idea when I 
duct-taped my Go-Pro to a hula-hoop and took it to Black Rock City.'

Shoulder skills: One dancer uses her shoulder instead of her stomach to spin the hoop

Spinning: The video has proved popular on the internet - it was only uploaded earlier this week, but it has already been viewed by hundreds of thousands of users

GoPro cameras are small and light-weight - therefore ideal to attach to a plastic hoop without hindering its movement.

Some of the dancers - which were all female -  did simple spins with the hoop, whereas others felt more brave and danced without the apparatus as well as blowing a kiss at the end of their segment.

One woman even managed to spin the hoop in a circle using her shoulder.

Once a year, tens of thousands of participants gather in Nevada's Black Rock Desert to create Black Rock City, dedicated to community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance.
