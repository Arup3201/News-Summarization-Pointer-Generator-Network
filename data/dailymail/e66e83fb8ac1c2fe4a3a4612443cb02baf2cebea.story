At a height of 5ft 5ins and weighing 115lb (8st 2lb), at first glance pretty Alexa Grasso doesn't look like she packs a punch.

But the 21-year-old, who lives in Mexico, has proved she's a force to be reckoned with in the ring as she remains undefeated as a professional Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter.

The strawweight (her weight category) is said to have knockout power that few women possess as she has already achieved four knockout wins in her professional career - which only began in 2012.

Alexa Grasso is an undefeated female fighter and has been in the ring since 2012 

She first decided to make a living as a fighter when she attended an event with her uncle, who is now her coach.

Alexa says that seeing women like herself in the ring made her realise that you don't have to be super macho to be strong.

At the age of 19 Alexa attended her first fight and won, her uncle now acts as her coach

'My inspiration was a day I accompanied my uncle, who is my coach, to a fight event where I saw my first women's fight,' she said.

'I was amazed to see that such beautiful and strong women could punch and kick that way against a larger rival. I saw the beauty of the sport and that women are just as capable as men to fight.'

The undefeated champ's first match was in December 2012 at the age of 19 and she took her energy from the hoards of supporters who were shouting her name.

'My first fight was a beautiful experience. A colleague and I fought at the same event. We prepared together and also went with many people who supported us.

The 21-year-old said her first fight was a beautiful experience and says that cheers from the crowd spurred her on to success 

Alexa says that despite the aggressive nature of the ring she is a quiet studious girl at school

'I was very nervous before getting into the ring but when I went up and everyone was shouting my name, it gave me a lot of energy and courage to achieve my goal.'

The former waitress said nobody messed with her during her school days after one day she exploded and defended herself against a fellow pupil.

'My school life was quiet. I have a memory of a colleague who always annoyed me, until one day I exploded and defended myself. Since that day nobody was annoying.'

Alexa says that despite her aggressive alter ego she still remains a hard working student.  

'I've always been very quiet and dedicated myself to studying. I think school is a very nice place. My favourite subject was natural sciences. And in college, to this point it has been morphology.'

Alexa said after seeing her first fight: 'I was amazed to see that such beautiful and strong women could punch and kick that way against a larger rival' 

Alexa, who has worked many jobs ranging from a hostess, to a secretary and an MMA instructor for children, said her parent's support has helped fighting career.

'My parents have supported me in all my decisions. My mom is very concerned, but always on the lookout for my tournaments or fights.

'My dad is always the happiest, he loves the idea of me being a fighter, and supports me with even the simplest things from helping with my uniform to drying my tears and saying beautiful words when I'm in the last weeks of preparation.'

The undefeated strawweight for Invicta FC has had six straight wins and no losses and could soon get the call up to UFC in the future.
