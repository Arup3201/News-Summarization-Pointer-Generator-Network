A street artist has filed a cease and desist letter to Apple accusing the company of not seeking permission to use a slogan he claims to own, it has been claimed.

James De La Vega, 46, is said to have filed the claim in reaction to Apple's usage of the phrase 'You're more powerful than you think' in its latest high-profile advertising campaign for the iPhone 5S.

The New York-based artist is known for writing motivational messages as part of his decade-long 'Become Your Dream' graffiti series, and allegedly claims the phrase Apple is using is so closely associated with his work that other companies have previously approached him to use it.

Dispute: James De La Vega is said to have sent a cease and desist letter to technology giant Apple. He apparently claims to have trademarked the phrase 'You're more powerful than you think'

De La Vega's inspirational slogans adorn not just walls and streets in New York, but have also previously been used in a range of commercial handbags and fashion accessories.

Now he claims that Apple has deliberately adopted one of them without seeking his permission in order to motivate potential customers into buying its products, according to Barbara Ross writing in the New York Daily News.

The newspaper quotes the letter De La Vega's lawyer Richard Garbarini allegedly sent to Apple as saying the company has violated the artist's rights as the 'common law owner of the trademark'.

Apple's usage of the slogan 'clearly misleads customers into believing De La Vega somehow supports, approves and/or endorses its products' it apparently adds.

Well-known: James De La Vega is famous for his street murals and chalk drawings, which can mainly be found in and around the East Harlem area of Upper Manhattan

The letter is said to conclude that De La Vega is hoping to negotiate for a settlement for using the phrase as he wants to avoid filing a lawsuit.

De La Vega is famous for his street murals and chalk drawings, which can mainly be found in and around the East Harlem area of Upper Manhattan.

He is a graduate of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York state, and a former art teacher at York Preparatory School.

A recipient of a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors Grant in 1999, De La Vega has had some of his work featured at Christie's auction house - although most of his art has been sold through his own East Village gallery, which closed in 2010.

A spokesperson for Apple was not immediately available for comment.
