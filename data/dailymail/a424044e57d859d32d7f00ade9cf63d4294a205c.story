Tristram Hunt has been told ‘you must do better with your policies’ in a scathing report from his former school headmaster.

Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary triggered a furious political row last week when he warned top public schools they would lose £700 million if they didn’t help local state pupils.

The plan was dismissed as ‘class war’ by critics.

Tristram Hunt's former headmaster at the £17,835-a-year University College School in Hampstead said he was 'disappointed' that the Labour shadow education spokesman 'pictured' had such an 'unoriginal policy'

But now Giles Slaughter, the retired headteacher who taught Mr Hunt at the £17,835-a-year University College School (UCS) in Hampstead, has issued his withering verdict. He dismisses the plan as ‘completely old hat’, saying it was first floated by Neil Kinnock, and that it would be a ‘seven-day wonder’. He has also ordered him to come up with better plans to improve the state sector.

Mr Slaughter – who took over at UCS in 1983, before Mr Hunt entered the school – told The Mail on Sunday he was ‘disappointed’ that ‘such an intelligent, articulate and delightful man has come up with something so totally unoriginal’.

Mr Slaughter said: ‘I would have expected more from him than this tired old saw, [such as] some proper ideas to improve schools.’

Mr Hunt, 40, angered private school headteachers by warning that under a Labour Government they would lose the tax breaks associated with their charitable status if they did not share teachers and facilities with local state schools.

But Mr Slaughter, 77, who retired in 1996 and now has a building at the school named after him, said: ‘This is an idea which has been around for decades – I remember Neil Kinnock calling for it in the 1970s. It is completely old hat and I am rather sad about it, because Tristram was such an intelligent and charming pupil.

‘I think it will die on its feet and be just a seven-day wonder. Most independent schools are already doing exactly what they are required to do as charities.’

Mr Slaughter, who said he had ‘no idea’ whether Mr Hunt was reflecting his own beliefs or pushing a party line, added that UCS had always been ‘very active in the local community’ and that during the MP’s time at the school the boys were involved in charitable activities such as helping the elderly.

UCS has forged links with three local state secondaries and several primaries, including help with Latin lessons and offering access to its swimming pool. More than nine out of ten independent schools are involved in similar partnerships.

After Mr Hunt condemned the ‘Berlin Wall’ between private and state education, which he said had created a ‘corrosive divide of privilege’, the current UCS headmaster Mark Beard fought back by describing the policy as ‘odious bigotry’.

Mr Beard said: ‘If Mr Hunt wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that UCS generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief.’

It triggered a very public war of words between Mr Hunt and the independent school sector. Some of his political opponents suspected the policy had been rushed out in order to appeal to Labour’s core vote and distract attention from the ‘snob’ row over former frontbencher Emily Thornberry’s Twitter message showing a flag-covered house in Rochester with a white van parked outside.

Yesterday Mr Hunt stoked the row further by pledging a Labour Government would send Ofsted inspectors into private schools to check they were doing enough to help local ones.

‘If the militants of independent schools say “never” then we will have to think again and Ofsted could be an answer,’ he said.

‘Go through some of these schools’ accounts and it is so hard to find what they have done.’

Mr Hunt, whose father is Baron Hunt of Chesterton, left UCS in 1992 with two As and a B to read history at Trinity College, Cambridge.

Last night he said: ‘The Labour Party remains committed to breaking down the barriers in our education system that stand in the way of opportunity and aspiration for all children.

‘We look forward to seeing more meaningful partnerships between state and private schools, and that is what this announcement is all about.’

It costs £5,462 to turn a new house into a home, according to a new study. The research shows that homeowners take weeks putting their stamp on a property before it feels like their own.

Nearly half install a new bathroom or kitchen but, for a third, that moment comes with something as simple as putting up photos. Getting out the paintbrush is also a rite of passage, while 11 per cent say it’s when a letter arrives with their new address on, according to the survey by Barratt Homes.

Kate Fox, from the Social Issues Research Centre, said: ‘Making a property feel like a home is really important. It’s just a shame that it can cost so much.’
