A Florida woman was horrified Sunday when she glanced over her shoulder while shopping at Walmart to find a man squatting on the floor with a camera trained up her skirt.

The woman, who identifies herself to reporters only as Tenicka, says James King, 42, went to the Apopka department store specifically to take photos up the skirts of women.

'That was his Sunday afternoon plan, he came there with no cart, he wasn't shopping, he was shopping for a woman with a dress on,' the horrified 35-year-old told WKMG.

Police say 42-year-old James King went to a Florida Walmart where he snapped photos up the skirt of a 35-year-old female shopper

Caught on camera: CCTV footage appears to show a man extending his phone beneath the skirt of the victim, who gave only her first name of Tenicka to reporters, at the Apopka department store

And the entire incident appears to have been captured on Walmart security cameras.

CCTV footage clearly shows Tenicka perusing the Walmart aisles in a white dress. A male figure walks up close to her and extends his arm toward her person while kneeling beside her.

Tenicka then turns and the jig is up.

Tenicka did not approach the man herself, but sent her nephew to speak with him. The nephew then pursues the voyeur and snaps photos of him leaving the store.

As he drives away, they jot down his license plate number, which is what would eventually lead police to King. 

'I just feel so violated, disgusted, and embarrassed,' Tenicka said. 'It just doesn't seem real, I don't want to believe this really happened.'

Tenicka sent her nephew to speak to King, seen here. The nephew also followed King as he fled the store and snapped pictures as proof. Tenicka jotted down his license plate number, which led police to King

Though he denied the accusations completely when questioned, King was soon arrested by local authorities.

He's now bailed himself out of jail, WKMG reports. Police are investigating whether King may have previously targeted other women.

'I just feel so violated, disgusted, and embarrassed,' Tenicka said. 'It just doesn't seem real, I don't want to believe this really happened.'
