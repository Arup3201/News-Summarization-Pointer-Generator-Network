Edward Lord, the FA’s Inclusion Advisory Board member axed for speaking out about a lack of action over discriminatory issues, has seriously upset FA bosses again.

The FA claim Lord is attending matches and attempting to gain access to VIP hospitality areas to meet people on the basis of still being on the Inclusion panel — behaviour FA general secretary Alex Horne has described as ‘abhorrent’.

But Lord counters that he has still been invited to clubs despite no longer being on the IAB and only met problems at Blackburn Rovers. He has also been to games at Manchester City, Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday, Bury and Accrington Stanley.

Horne said in a letter to Lord: ‘Even as a serving IAB member, I would find this strange when there is no rationale for such activity.

‘As an ex-member of the IAB, I find this behaviour truly abhorrent and I would ask you to cease and desist with immediate effect.’

Lord wrote back: ‘When I was a member of IAB it was agreed that I would continue to visit clubs at my own expense to liaise with senior figures on inclusion matters.

‘No club withdrew their invitation after my office told them of my change of circumstances. It only became an issue at Blackburn.’

The Welsh vote that propelled British Lions star Leigh Halfpenny to second place in last year’s Sports Personality of the Year vote could put Champions League winner Gareth Bale on the SPOTY podium in Glasgow along with Rory McIlroy and Lewis Hamilton. 

But Bale won’t be there on the night as he will be on FIFA Club World Cup duty with Real Madrid in Morocco.

Sajid Javid, who has shown minimal interest in sport since becoming Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, has nevertheless added his signature to a letter to FIFA president Sepp Blatter calling for the Michael Garcia report into World Cup bid corruption to be published in full.

However, Javid’s support for the online secondary ticket market is likely to mean that House of Lords-led efforts to regulate the sale of Rugby World Cup tickets by touts will be scuppered by the Government.

UK Sport are involved in a wide consultation process on whether to tweak their elite focus on winning medals to also fund a popular, diverse team sport such as basketball, which has no medal prospects. 

Yet there seems no appetite among the UK Sport hierarchy to change their strategy, which chairman Rod Carr describes as ‘massively successful’. 

The best solution — which rowing grandee Sir David Tanner backs — sees grassroots funding agency Sport England charged with funding sports that don’t fit the medal-winning criteria.

And the band play on 

The future of the England supporters’ band after its drumbeat backing of an anti-IRA chant has been brought into sharp focus by FA of Ireland chief John Delaney having to apologise for singing pro-IRA songs.

Delaney said sorry on Tuesday for joining in the singing of rebel ballad Joe McDonnell in a Dublin bar after the Republic of Ireland’s victory over the USA. 

FAI lawyers initially denied the incident had happened but footage was posted on YouTube.

Delaney, who was celebrating the victory with a group of 16, said: ‘When you sing a song like that, you don’t believe every word. It’s a typically Irish thing we do. But if the song offends anybody, of course I’m sorry.’

It was expected after the England band’s accompaniment during the Scotland friendly at Celtic Park to repeated chants of ‘F*** the IRA’ that they wouldn’t be welcome by the Irish football authorities at the Aviva Stadium, where England play Ireland on June 7.

That will be England’s first match in Dublin since the 1995 fixture was abandoned due to crowd violence.

But Delaney said after his own IRA-connected controversy: ‘We will work closely with the FA over the band and any other crowd issue.

‘England fans have been brilliant in recent years and I regard what happened in Glasgow with the band as a one-off.’
