Prince Harry revealed his 'irritation' about some nations' failure to help remove landmines from African countries, as he followed in his mother's footsteps during a visit to Angola.

Harry has just returned from Angola where he saw mine clearance projects run by The Halo Trust, the world's oldest and largest humanitarian landmine clearance organisation.

The 28-year-old has taken up his mother's mantle by backing the cause which was close to her heart.

Guy Willoughby, Halo's chief executive, said: 'He is irritated about the countries that supplied these landmines are not actually putting in any funds to clear them 25 years later.

'He has got quite a bee in his bonnet about that, and that is good...

'The minefields that his mother visited are all now shops and roads and there's even an estate agent's on one of them.'

He added: 'Halo is delighted that Prince Harry has come out to Angola to support us in getting mines out of the ground, for good.Â

'The commitment shown by Prince Harry plays an invaluable role in helping us to raise awareness of Halo's work and mission.

'Wars may be over but many people are still unable to resume their normal lives, facing the threat of death or injury by landmines every day.

'Halo is making excellent progress in Angola, with the province of Huambo now close to becoming mine free, but there are still many years of work to be done. With support from Prince Harry, Angola and the international community, Halo will continue to work towards a mine-free Angola for the benefit of the Angolan people.'

Harry's trip to Angola is part of his role as patron of the trust's 25th anniversary appeal

The organisation removes landmines and unexploded ordnance from war-torn countries so that some of the world's most vulnerable people can plant crops, rebuild homes and raise families in safety.

Harry's trip to Angola is part of his role as patron of the trust's 25th anniversary appeal.

While there he visited demining teams across the region, touring minefields and meeting some of the key beneficiaries of Halo's work. He concentrated his visit on the south-eastern Angolan town of Cuito Cuanavale, believed to be the most heavily mined town in Africa.
