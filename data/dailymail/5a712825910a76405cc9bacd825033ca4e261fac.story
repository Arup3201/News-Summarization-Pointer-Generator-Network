A girl of seven escaped from a house fire which killed her mother, her mother's friend and two young boys in the early hours yesterday.

The girl, named Tia, was found alone and terrified by firefighters in the back garden of her terraced home as the blaze spread through the rest of the property.

Her mother, Claire James, 27, her friend, Josie Leighton, 32, and Josie's sons, Jordan Green, 12, and Tyler Green, nine, were all trapped upstairs and died in the fire.

Survived: Tia, whose face has been pixellated by MailOnline, was the only survivor of the fire

Tragedy: Josie Leighton, 32, who was killed in the fire which broke out at around 5am yesterday

Killed in the fire: Josie Leighton's two sons Jordan, 12, (left) and Tyler, nine (right) who also died in the house fire in North Wingfield, Derbyshire

Police and fire crews say the source 
of the blaze could have been a portable heater left on downstairs during
what was one of the coldest nights of the winter so far.

But they said they were unable to rule
out the possibility the fire was started deliberately. Tia, who evaded 
deadly fumes and flames to escape into the garden of the house in North 
Wingfield, Derbyshire, was taken to hospital with only minor injuries. 
She is being kept under observation at Chesterfield Royal Hospital.

It is thought that Miss Leighton, a 
care home worker, had recently separated from her partner. She and her 
sons were staying with Miss James while they looked for somewhere else 
to live.

A friend of Miss Leighton, who didn't 
want to be named, said last night: 'I can't get their (Jordan and 
Tyler's) poor little faces out my head, I'd only seen and spoke to them 
yesterday. They were lovely lads, always smiling, and everybody knew 
that they were close brothers.'

She added that both women, who were 
single mothers, had known each other for a number of years and shared 
childcare.

'Josie stopped over at Claire's last 
night, and to think that they went to bed and didn't wake up is just 
horrifying,' she added.

Miss James's cousin, Zoe Maude, said:
'Claire was an amazing mum to Tia, they were inseparable and she really
doted on her. Tia was a real mummy's girl.

'Poor Tia is going to grow up without a mum and that this has happened just a few weeks before Christmas is just heartbreaking.'

The exterior of the house showed 
little evidence of damage, but fire chief Kam Basri described how his 
officers had battled thick smoke inside the property in a bid to rescue 
the victims.

He said: 'It was thoroughly 
smoke-logged and four rescues were carried out. Unfortunately those 
rescues did not prevail and all four perished through the fire.

'It is far too early to say what the cause of the fire was.'

Pete Ripley, divisional director for 
East Midlands Ambulance Service, said they had been called to the fire 
at 5.10am.

Police investigation: The emergency services were called to the home in North Wingfield, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire, at around 5am

He added: 'This was a particularly tragic incident and we are
providing our staff with all the support necessary to help them deal 
with the distressing situation they encountered.'

Neighbour Paul Allen, 33, said: 'This will devastate North Wingfield. It is only a small place and people will be very upset.'

Tammy Nash, 30, the mother of a girl 
who was friends with Jordan, said: 'He was a lovely lad who would do 
anything for you. My daughter is in absolute bits.'

Four deaths: Two adults and two children died in the fire in North Wingfield. A girl called Tia, seven, survived the fire after escaping into the garden

The blaze is the fourth in Derbyshire in just three and a half years in which children have died.

In April 2010, five-year-old Niamh 
Adams and her brother Cayden, two, were killed in a fire at their home 
in Buxton. Their mother, Fiona Adams, was charged with their murders but
later cleared.

Tommy Henson, nine, Alisha 
Henson-Nulty, six, Rocco Henson-Nulty, four, and Appolonia Henson, two, 
died after a stray spark from a log fire started an inferno in their 
home in Hulland Ward in January 2011.

And in May last year Jade Philpott, 
ten, and her brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, 
and Jayden, five, were killed when their parents Mick and Mairead 
started a blaze at their home in Derby along with family friend Paul 
Mosley.
