Us girls at A Style Album are self-confessed jewellery junkies, they say diamonds are a girl's best friend, but we are just as happy with some bright coloured beads.

Jewellery can really make an outfit and shows your individuality. A simple jeans and tee combo can be made so much more interesting by layering necklaces, stacking bracelets or piling on rings.

It can equally work the other way, when going for a dressier style a few cool jewellery pieces can instantly relax the look.

We love discovering new accessory brands and our favourite find this year has to be Say What you C, a simple idea of silver or gold bars designed to be layered, and engraved with anything you wish.

We can't get enough of these cool, individual pieces. 

Choose your children's names, a quote or a special date - anything that has a special meaning to you can make a great touch.

They make a lovely gift and are very reasonably priced, too.

Louise and Emma's discovery of the year so far is jewellery brand Say What you C, which designs simple gold or silver bar necklaces that can be engraved with a special message, name or date

Say What You C necklaces are designed to be layered-up, so mix and match the colours, chain lengths and engravings, to really personalise the look, say Louise and Emma

Mia Lia has been a long standing favourite jewellery brand of ours, and we're rarely seen without the fashionable keepsake bracelets piled up on our wrists.

Known for stylish hand made fashion jewellery with a bohemian touch, the brand has a great selection of bright pieces made from natural stones.

A standout range for us has to be the Star Bright Star Light collection, so cool and perfect for the star-obsessed A Style Album team.

For a bit of fun, the brightly coloured jewels from Rainbowlink ticks all the boxes.

Now that the sun is coming out, why not add a bit of colour with the fluorescent bracelets, each stamped with a fun mantra.

A cool, quirky concept and perfect for summer, we love these for an instant wardrobe update.

If you're looking at investing in something more classic, Maria Black has a range of simple, stylish pieces made from precious metals.

With a fashion-forward approach to conceptual jewellery design, Maria Black's collection is designed to be mixed and matched, creating a truly individual look.

Loved by celebrities including Nicole Richie, Jessica Alba and Beyonce, Maria Black understands the significance of accessories in everyday looks.

When Lou celebrated her 40th birthday last year, it was fine jewellery designer Anita Ko who Jamie looked to for the perfect gift, choosing the single arrow earring that shoots through the ear.

Perfect for the evening, Anita Ko's pieces are equally as stylish when worn with a casual look to add a bit of luxury.

Em also bought Lou the single diamond ear cuff which complements the arrow perfectly.

Another fine jewellery designer we adore is Rosa De La Cruz, especially the LOVE ring. The pieces are easy to wear, and are classic yet edgy.

Check out the high street for purse friendly alternatives, if you're not ready to splash out. Zara Simon's collaboration with Accessorize for example, has a great selection of sophisticated and directional gold plated designs.

The Rosa De La Cruz range features  hand-crafted necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings designed to be layered for a luxe aesthetic.

Louise wraps a beautiful Hermes Twilly scarf around her wrist for a hint of colour without any bling. Both Emma and Lou say this is a brilliant alternative, if you're not into wearing jewellery

If jewellery isn't your thing, then try using silk scarves or bandannas to accessorise your outfit.

Wrap brightly coloured scarves around your wrist or tie a bandanna loosely around your neck in a simple knot, for an instant outfit pick me up. Use brights that pick out hints of colour from your outfit.

Finding jewellery that you feel good wearing is the perfect complement to any outfit. Choose what you love and have fun with your accessories.

Until next time,
