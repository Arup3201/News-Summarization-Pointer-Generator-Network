Michael Sam says there are 'a lot' of gay players in the NFL and some have reached out to him.

The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported Sam gave a speech Thursday at the Dallas Holocaust Museum and took questions from the audience.

Sam said: 'I'm just saying there is a lot of us.' He added he'd never out a player who confided in him, but 'there's some famous people'.

Michael Sam insists there are many more gay players in the NFL, with some famous names among them

Sam was drafted by the Rams in last year's draft and was picked up by the Cowboys after his release

Sam came out before last year's NFL draft. The defensive end from Missouri was selected in the seventh round by the St. Louis Rams and cut in training camp. The Dallas Cowboys signed him to their practice squad but released him in October.

He's currently a free agent.

Sam revealed he's not talked to his father since Michael Sam Snr criticised his son's sexuality shortly after he came out.
