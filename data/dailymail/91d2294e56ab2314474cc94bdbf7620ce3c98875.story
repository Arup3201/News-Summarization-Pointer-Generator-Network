Learner drivers’ chances of passing their test vary widely depending on where they live, official figures show.

Barely a quarter of women and a third of men pass their test in inner city areas like Birmingham. Leeds, London and Bradford.

But more than three quarters of drivers in rural  areas get to tear up their L plates after being given the thumbs up by their examiner, in part because they learn drive in fields before they even turn 17.

Driving test pass rates for women are highest in Ballachulish in Scotland and lowest in South Yardley in Birmingham

Around 1.4million driving tests are carried out each year, although the number has fallen by more than a sixth since before the financial crash.

Last year it was announced the driving test could be overhauled, with the three-point turn test scrapped altogether and replaced with parking manoeuvres.

Learners could be asked to follow directions on a satnav as part of a radically revised practical exam designed to reflect ‘real-world’ conditions.

According to latest figures around half of men pass their test compared to around 43 per cent of women.

However there are dramatic differences between test centres in different parts of the country.

People living in more affluent areas are likely to be able to afford more lessons before putting in for their test.

Those who grew up in the countryside are likely to hone their skills steering a car in the drive or practising clutch skills in a field, long before they turn 17.

Pass rates are lower in inner city urban areas, where there are fewer opportunities to practise safely.

It is a brave parent who would venture into a city centre with a learner driver at the wheel, especially as they are unlikely to drive very often themselves.

For women, the pass rate in 2013-14 was highest in Ballachulish, in the Scottish Highland at 77 per cent.

The top 10 areas include the Isle of Skye, Kendal in the Lake District and Barrow in Furness in Lancashire.

But contrast, the lowest pass rates were mostly in urban areas, the lowest at the South Yardley test centre in Birmingham, where just 27.4 per cent got their licence.

Four of the 10 lowest pass rates were in London, and other areas include Bradford, Heckmondwike in West Yorkshire and the market town of Wednesbury in the West Midlands.

Men taking their tests had a higher pass rate on Benbecula Island in the Outer Hebrides and lowest in Belvedere in south east London

The driving test was introduced on March 13, 1935, when were only 1.5 million registered vehicles.

The year before the compulsory test was brought in, there were 7,000 people were killed as a result of road accidents.

Since its inception, the test has been adapted to reflect advances in car design and changing road layout.

Hand signals were removed in 1975 and a video hazard perception test introduced in 2002.

Since 1996, drivers have to pass the written Theory Test before they are able to take the practical driving test.

Two "Show me" "Tell me" questions involving vehicle safety were introduced at the beginning of the practical test in September 2003.

The Driving Standards Agency conducted 1.5 million driving tests in 2013-14.

Just under half of people (47.1 per cent) passed their test last year

There is a similar pattern for men, who had the highest pass rate on the island of Benbecula in the Outer Herbrides (82.6 per cent).

Test centres in Wales including Pwllheli, Lampeter and Llandrindod also had high pass rates.

Once again, many of the lowest pass rates were in London and the South East, including Belvedere (36.1 per cent), Enfield (40.8 per cent), Barking (36.7 per cent) and Wood Green (39.4 per cent).

Some test centres with low pass rates are in areas with high levels of immigration.

Since last year all driving tests have to be carried out in English or Welsh, following concerns about fraud involving interpreters.

It followed the case of Allyson Ng, who was jailed after selling answers to the written test in Mandarin to 94 people.

John Lepine, general manager of the Motor Schools Association, said: ‘The more rural a test centre is, they tend to have a higher pass rates because people in those areas find cheaper insurance, there are more vehicles around, mum and dad are used to taking them out on journeys.

‘People in rural communities tend to be more experienced. An awful lot of them have learnt the skills driving around a field.

‘If you live in an inner city area, it is more expensive to put young people on insurance and you never drive very far.

‘Areas like Wood Green have a high degree of immigration, English is not their first language. They have to do the test in English so that can be a problem.’

He stressed that the variations were the result of differing abilities between those being tested. ‘We are very happy with the consistency of the results across the country.’

A spokesman for the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said: ‘Pass rates can be influenced by various factors. Some people take more lessons and are better prepared for the test. Statistical factors can also play a part as the number of tests conducted at different test centres varies significantly.

‘We train examiners to a high standard and closely monitor their work to ensure that all tests are assessed consistently across the country.’
