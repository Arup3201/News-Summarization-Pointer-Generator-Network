Steve McClaren will not be taking over the vacant managerial position at Newcastle United, Derby County chief executive Sam Rush has insisted.

The former England boss was installed as the favourite to succeed Alan Pardew, whose former side were booed by their own fans after a lucklustre third-round defeat by Leicester, but Rush said McClaren will be going ‘absolutely nowhere’ as the club bid for promotion to the Premier League.

‘Steve and I caught up after the Southport game, as we do after all games,’ said Rush. ‘We had a chat about the speculation and after our chat I thought it was sensible just to confirm that Steve McClaren is going absolutely nowhere.

‘He is 100 per cent committed to the club. We are at the beginning of our journey with Derby County and we are looking forward to having a very successful second half to the season. I am aware that there is speculation about Steve but he has completely dismissed it. His future is with us.’

McClaren, whose Championship side needed a stoppage-time penalty by substitute Chris Martin to secure a 1-0 home win over Conference strugglers Southport, has already brought in Darren Bent on loan this transfer window and Rush predicts more moves to strengthen the team’s promotion push.

‘We have concluded some early-January business and we believe there is more ahead of us,’ he said.

As the search for Pardew’s replacement continues Newcastle stand-in coach John Carver will meet managing director Lee Charnley early this week to discuss his prospects of keeping the job until the end of the season.

But with Newcastle insistent that the man who takes over from Pardew will be known as the head coach and, according to Carver, have no say in transfer dealings, other leading candidates are already distancing themselves from the job. 

Ajax coach Frank de Boer is understood not to want it, and certainly not on those terms, while Rafa Benitez, currently at Napoli, would also not join under the conditions owner Mike Ashley wishes to impose on the new man.

Carver’s best hope of securing the job appears to be his willingness to co-operate with the current ownership model.

Carver said: ‘The conversation I had with Lee last Monday was: “Look after Burnley, look after the FA Cup game” and that was it. I’m sure we’ll talk this week.’

But Carver’s chances of securing the job were not helped by Saturday’s 1-0 defeat, with a goal by Leicester’s Leonardo Ulloa — and the outbreak of hostility from fans, who booed their team at the end and renewed their protests against Ashley. 

At the end Carver led the team over to the 4,5000 travelling fans who booed, gestured for the players to leave and chanted: ‘We’re s*** and we’re sick of it.’ Earlier they had demanded that Ashley ‘get out of our club’.

Carver, a Newcastle man to his core, has travelled as a fan of the club before, including to the 1998 FA Cup final. Asked if he would have booed, he said: ‘Yes, I would. Because I would’ve been disappointed, because we’re out of the FA Cup.

‘It’s probably one of the toughest moments I’ve ever experienced in football. But the fans are entitled to do that. I was making sure the players were going to take it. Because when you do well you accept the plaudits and when it’s not going well you have to take it on the chin.’

Carver added: ‘I’d be mad not to want to be head coach. If ever there’s an opportunity it’s now. If I don’t throw my hat in the ring, I’ll never get that opportunity again.’
