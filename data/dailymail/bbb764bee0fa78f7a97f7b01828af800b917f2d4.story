The woman fell from a 13th floor unit in a block of flats in Surfers Paradise at 2.20am and police are treating the death as suspicious.

The victim, believed to be in her mid-twenties, is yet to be identified.

Police say there was a disturbance at the unit before the woman fell, but the man who lives at the unit was not there when police arrived.

The woman's body has remained at the crime scene as officers carry out their investigations.

Fifteen minutes after the incident, firefighters were called to the same block of flats to investigate a 'gas hazard'.

A Queensland Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman says its crews carried out atmospheric testing.

'But that matter is now in the hands of police,' she said.

Police have been conducting investigations at the scene and are appealing for anyone who may have CCTV, camera or mobile phone vision of the Avalon Apartment building around the time the woman fell, to contact Gold Coast Police or Crime Stoppers.
