An Air France passenger jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Ireland after a shipment of peppers set off a fire alarm during its transatlantic journey.

The Boeing 747-400 was flying from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to Paris when its flight crew was alerted to a potential fire in the cargo hold.

But reports say there was no fire at all and the alarm sounded because of the heat from the peppers.

It was the third time this year that a shipment of organic material has set off an aircraft alarm and forced a flight to divert to Shannon Airport, the Irish Independent reported.

In Sunday’s incident, the Air France flight crew declared an emergency and requested permission to divert to the nearest airport.

Air France spokeswoman Ulli Gendrot told MailOnline Travel that the plane was carrying 142 passengers, two pilots and 12 cabin crew.
