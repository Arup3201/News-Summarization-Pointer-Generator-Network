A teenager whose arm was severed below the elbow as he cleaned a restaurant pasta machine has had the limb successfully reattached.

Brett Bouchard, 17, is able to move his right arm again less than three weeks after his accident at Violi's Restaurant in Massena, New York, on the Canadian border, where he worked in the kitchen.

So far, Bouchard has undergone four surgeries at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Doctors say his quick decision to apply a tourniquet and recover the lost limb have helped his recovery.

'I’m feeling great,' Bouchard told reporters assembled at his hospital bedside Friday, according to ABC News. 'Every single day, just focused on my recovery and getting better.'

Bouchard will need still more surgeries to transfer new muscles to his hand. But he's confident he'll be able to regrow the nerves in his lower arm and regain his sense of touch.

'Horrific' accident: Brett Bouchard's arm was severed when a spaghetti-maker was turned on as he was cleaning it

The incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. on April 27, when Bouchard was cleaning the pasta-maker at Violi's.

Bouchard's right arm got caught in the industrial-size machine and was severed at the elbow.

Bouchard was rushed to Massena Memorial Hospital before being air-lifted to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, about 350 miles away.

According to the Watertown Daily Times, a supervisor at Massena Memorial tried to have Bouchard taken to the Fletcher Allen Health Center in Burlington, Vermont - which is more than 200 miles closer to Massena than Massachusetts General - but the hospital would not accept Bouchard.

Bouchard had reportedly worked at Violi's Italian restaurant for a little over a year

'We’re all still in shock. One of our employees severed his arm last 
night,' Ross Violi, who owns the restaurant with his brother Dominic, told the paper.

Restaurant employees are still trying to figure out how the machine was turned on while Bouchard was cleaning it.

The U.S. Department of Labor currently is investigating the incident, as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is trying to determine whether cleaning the pasta-maker constitutes as 'operating' the machine - in which case, the restaurant might have been in violation of labor codes because Bouchard is 17. Federal labor guidelines state that to operate certain pieces of industrial equipment, the operator needs to be at least 18 years old.

It's unclear whether an industrial pasta maker falls under those guidelines.

Bouchard says he's just excited for things to start getting back to normal - and to get some feeling back in his hand.

'He’s not going to be a piano player, but he should have some function and feeling and that’s the goal,' his mother said.

Bouchard was forced to be airlifted to a hospital 300 miles away after he was turned away from a much closer hospital

Mia Violi, a manager at the restaurant, has started a GoFundMe page to help raise money for Bouchard's medical treatment and travel expenses for his family.

'A hardworking, young man had part of his arm severed in half while working. We would like to raise money to help with medical expenses and travel expenses for his family. If you can help, please do. Brett is an amazing young man and deserves any help. Thank you so much,' she wrote on the page.
