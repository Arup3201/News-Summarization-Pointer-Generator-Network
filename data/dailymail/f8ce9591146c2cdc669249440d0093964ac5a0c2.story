The loner who has said he killed an Hasidic boy was a strange man who looked like serial murderer Charles Manson, neighbours and friends claim.

Levi Aron, 35, of Brooklyn, New York, admitted to murdering and dismembering eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky, and was arrested on Wednesday, police said.

Neighbours of the so-called ‘Butcher of Brooklyn’ said he would stare strangely at schoolchildren and often became angry with no warning.

Leiby disappeared on Monday while on the way to meet his mother nearby a day camp, but he got lost and asked Aron, a stranger, for help.

Aron has been arrested on a second-degree murder charge after police found the boy’s remains in a fridge and dumpster.

Aron worked for plumbing firm Empire State Supply in Brooklyn, where his boss described him as an ‘emotionally disturbed’ worker.

‘He was very quiet, didn't communicate with people and he went home,’ shop owner Michael Panzer told the New York Post.

Neighbour Chaim Lefkovitz, 39, said parents would not let their children go near Aron because he would get ‘angry out of nowhere’.

Family acquaintance Lee Vogel, 21, told the New York Post the ‘look in his eye’ reminded him of California serial killer Charles Manson.

Aron’s was little trouble to authorities prior to this week as the only fault on his record was a summons for public urination last year.

But this quiet public man had a Facebook page with 220 friends and listed his favourite TV shows as ‘Glee’ and ‘The Office’, reported the New York Post.

His favourite music artists included Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and the Black Eyed Peas. He also enjoyed singing Lionel Richie at karaoke.

He was married in 2004 for just one year to Diana Diunov, 38, a woman later convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges, court records show.

Shortly after this break-up, Aron met his next wife, Debby Kivel, 34, on the Jewish dating website SawYouAtSinai.com.

They got married in 2006 and he moved from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, to join her and her two children. They divorced in 2007.

She said he was injured aged nine in a bicycle accident and has been nervous around people ever since, but ‘loved children’.

His father is an accountant in Manhattan, his mother died of cancer around eight years ago and his sister Sarah died in 2009, reported the New York Post.

But he has two brothers, Rocky and Joe, and was briefly engaged again with another woman after breaking up with Ms Kivel.

Aron is now being investigated to see if he is linked to other missing children cases, reported WABC.

The following transcript was posted on the NBC New York website, and has been edited to 'remove parts of an extremely graphic nature' - but not for clarity. These are Levi Aron's words written on a legal notebook during questioning, law enforcement sources told NBC New York.

My name is Levi Aron... On Monday evening around 5:30 I went to my dentist, Dr Sorcher, to make a payment for visit for exam routine.

Walking: Levi Aron is moved by police from the 67th Police Precinct in Brooklyn on Wednesday

A boy approached me on where the Judaica book store was. He was still there when went out from the dentist’s office. He asked me for a ride to the Judaica book store. While on the way he changed his mind and wasn’t sure where he wanted to go.

So I asked if he wanted to go for the ride - wedding in Monsey - since I didn’t think I was going to stay for the whole thing since my back was hurting. He said OK.

Due to traffic, I got back around 11:30 p.m. … so I brought him to my house thinking I’d bring him to his house the next day. He watched TV then fell asleep in the front room. I went to the middle room to sleep. That next morning, he was still sleeping when I was ready to leave.

So I woke him and told him I’ll bring him to his house… when I saw the flyers I panicked and was afraid.  When I got home he was still there so I made him a tuna sandwich....

Afterwards - I panicked because I didn’t know what to do with the body.… carried parts to the back room placing parts between the freezer and the refrigerator …

… went to clean up a little then took a second shower.  I panicked and .. Then putting the parts in a suitcase.  Then carrying suitcase to the car …placing in back seat on floor behind passenger side.

… drove around approximately around 20 minutes before placing it in the dumpster on 20th street just before 4th Avenue.   Then went home to clean and organise.

I understand this may be wrong and I’m sorry for the hurt that I have caused.
