It took 12 firefighters three hours to decide how to rescue this lamb after it fell down a well in Shropshire - they used a ladder in the end

A team of 12 firefighters rushed to a farm in three fire engines to rescue a lamb that had fallen down a well.

Emergency services sped to the scene at midday yesterday, and spent nearly three hours discussing their plan of action.

Eventually they came to a conclusion and at 3pm they finally used a crane to lower a ladder 32ft (10m) down into the well so a lone fire officer could climb down and carry the lamb to the surface.

The uninjured animal was then returned safely to its mother at Shepherds Whym Farm, Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, and fire crews left the scene.

The Shropshire Fire and Rescue operation is believed to have cost around £6,000, based on the cost of having three tenders and a dozen men out for three hours.

Residents who gathered at the scene in the Shropshire countryside to watch the rescue operation were left questioning why it took so many firefighters to rescue one stranded lamb.

Student Kayleigh Parker, 21, said: 'All it took was a ladder and one man to climb down there and back out again.

'I sincerely hope it didn't keep them from attending any serious incidents that were going on elsewhere because it seemed a disproportionate reaction.'

Father-of-four Phillip Hall, 36, added: 'Firefighters do an amazing job but you really have to question why one lamb really needed three fire engines and a dozen men.

'You could see them all standing there figuring out how best to approach the operation. I was thinking "Just get on with it".

After three hours of deliberation, the firefighters lowered a ladder into the well and brought the lamb out

'All they did in the end is lower a ladder down and one bloke was down and back out in no time.  It was hardly a major operation - I have seen fewer fire engines at actual fires.'

A spokesperson for Shropshire Fire & Rescue Service said: 'The lamb was remarkably calm after its ordeal and seemed content as it was returned to its mother.

'It is not known how the lamb got down there but seemed to be fine and ran off when placed back on firm ground.'

Fire brigades spent at least £3.5m in three years rescuing animals including a snail, a lost duckling and seven dolphins, according to figures released in 2011.

The three-hour rescue operation had a happy ending, but at an estimated £6,000 cost to the taxpayer
