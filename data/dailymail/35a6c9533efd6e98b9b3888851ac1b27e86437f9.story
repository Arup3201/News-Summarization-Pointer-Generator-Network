South Korean troops have exchanged fire with a runaway soldier who was surrounded in a forest after he killed five comrades and wounded three others near his North Korea border outpost.

One platoon leader was wounded when the 
sergeant, identified only by his surname Yim, threw a grenade and shot at closing in on him.

Now officers have brought in the man's parents to persuade him to surrender, a defence official said.

A Defence Ministry spokesman said the 22-year-old sergeant, identified only by his surname Yim, shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself

Troops had surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father

Villagers 
in a nearby area were warned not to leave their houses. The village 
head, Jang Seok-kwon, said that he heard gunshots ring out about 10 
times on Sunday.

Defense official Kim Min-seok said Sunday
 at a televised briefing that all the wounded were expected to survive, 
although two were injured seriously.

Yim, who was scheduled to be discharged 
from the military in September, fired at fellow soldiers with his 
standard-issue K2 assault rifle before fleeing with the weapon.

A Defense Ministry spokesman said it wasn't clear how much ammunition Yim had.

Park Cheol-yong, the head of Madal village, near the army division where the gunfire took place, said he warned villagers to stay in their houses.

Park Jin-soo, a pastor at a church in the village, said that Sunday services would take place as usual despite the tension over the missing soldier and the shooting.

It was not clear what triggered the rampage and there was no indication that North Korea, South Korea's bitter rival, was involved

Yim's parents also used a loudspeaker to try to persuade him to surrender

Thousands of troops from the rival Koreas are squared off along the world's most heavily armed border.

There was no indication that North Korea was involved. But tensions between the two countries have been high recently, with North Korea staging a series of missile and artillery drills and threatening South Korea's leader.

The Koreas have also traded fire along their disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea. South Korea has repeatedly vowed to respond with strength if provoked by the North.

Shootings have happened along the border before. In 2011, a 19-year-old marine corporal went on a shooting rampage at a Gwanghwa Island base, just south of the maritime border with North Korea.

Military investigators later said that corporal was angry about being shunned and slighted and showed signs of mental illness before the shooting.

In 2005, a soldier tossed a hand grenade and opened fire at a front-line army unit in a rampage that killed eight colleagues and injured several others.

Yim was due to complete his nearly two years of mandatory military service in September, according to defence officials

Initial personality tests last April put him within a group of soldiers who needed special attention and were unfit for frontline duty, a Defence Ministry official said

A Defence Ministry spokesman said two of the wounded were in a serious condition, but added that all three were expected to survive (pictured, soldiers from Yim's outpost)

Pfc. Kim Dong-min told investigators he was enraged at superiors who verbally abused him.

All able-bodied South Korean men must serve about two years in the military under a conscription system aimed at countering aggression from North Korea.

The Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

About 28,500 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea as a deterrent against North Korean aggression.
