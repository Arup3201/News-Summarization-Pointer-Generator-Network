Forget the winter woolies – your sunglasses may be more useful this weekend.

Even the sunscreen could be required as Britain is set to enjoy a real touch of spring.

In fact, with temperatures expected to hit 17C (63F) in the South and 15C (59F) in the North, the country will be hotter than the Mediterranean today – beating Rome at 14C (57F), as well as Athens and Tunisia (both 13C/55F).

Areas of the country could see the thermometer hit as high as 17ºC- almost double the average for this time of year and hotter than parts of the Mediterranean

But sunseekers should make the most of the balmy weekend – as although tomorrow is expected to be pleasant, the coming week is predicted to be very wet and windy.

Met Office spokesman Nicky Maxey said: ‘It is going to be fine and dry on Saturday with the best of the weather in the South. It is looking warm and we could see 17C (63F) in some spots, although there will be some strong winds around fairly widely.

Chris Burton, of The Weather Network, said temperatures will be well above the average March figure of 9C (48F). He added: ‘Sheltered areas of eastern Scotland and eastern England could well see temperatures locally getting up to 16C (61F) or 17C (63F).

‘While much of England and Wales will have a mild and dry day with sunny spells on Saturday, Northern Ireland and Scotland will be cloudier with outbreaks of rain.’ 

Many places could see highs of 14 or 15C tomorrow and in some sheltered spots temperatures could top 17C, according to weather experts
