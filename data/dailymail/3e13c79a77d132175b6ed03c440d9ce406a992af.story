Disgraced hand surgeon Michael Brown has died just two weeks after he was found incoherent in his closet following a suicide attempt.

Doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach, Florida switched off Brown's life support on Friday morning after declaring him brain dead.

The once-successful Houston doctor, whose fall from grace included assault charges and a well-documented dependency on prescription and illicit drugs, had gone into cardiac arrest after trying to take his life on October 24.

His girlfriend told police he was suicidal because he was stressed over his ongoing divorce and financial problems. He was also due to start a 30-day prison sentence the following day.

Fall from grace: Michael Brown, who suffered a heart attack after trying to commit suicide, died today after doctors switched off his life support. The former hand surgeon was due to serve 30 days in jail the day after he tried to take his life

Emergency responders went to his mansion in Miami Beach and found the 56-year-old incoherent and intoxicated inside the closet in the master bedroom alongside $16,000.

A police report said he had left a suicide note on a night stand. Authorities did not say how he had tried to kill himself.

After he was taken to hospital, a court filing stated: 'Dr Brown remains hospitalized and is incapacitated. The extent of the damage he has suffered is unknown, however 
it appears to be severe and, at this time, counsel has no ability to 
communicate with him.'

Former life: He was once a renowned hand surgeon with a number of clinics across the country

Brown was put on life support but on Wednesday, doctors found he had no remaining brain wave activity. At 8.15am on Friday, the devices were switched off.

But David Brown, a Houston attorney 
representing Michael Brown's wife in the couple's divorce case - and no 
relation to the late doctor - expressed anger that the life support had 
been removed.

'It's 
pretty outrageous to me that it would happen without notifying the 
family,' David Brown told the Houston Chronicle on Friday.

Michael
 Brown had appointed a former employee as a medical surrogate and they 
had not been contacted be the life support was removed either, David 
Brown said.

A spokesman at Mt. Sinai Medical Center said he couldn't confirm that Brown had been there due to patient confidentiality rules.

The former physician, who lost his medical license 
in 2006 after he tested positive for cocaine, had been a fixture in 
Texas courts for years.

Before
 his fall from grace, he was an award-winning and renowned hand surgeon 
with a number of carpel tunnel clinics across the country.

But in 2001, his third wife, Darlina 
Brown, sued him for allegedly beating her with a bedpost when she was 
seven months pregnant.

Troubled: At the time of his suicide attempt, he was in a divorce battle with his fourth wife, Rachel Brown, pictured with her new boyfriend, former baseball player, Jeff Bagwell. She accused Brown of assault

It made him a punchline as Brown and his family had previously starred in television commercials advertising the clinics with the tagline, 'We treat you like family.'

In
 2011, Brown went to trial on charges he threw a humanitarian award and 
two heavy vases at his fourth wife, Rachel Brown. He was later acquitted.

It was not the first time Rachel Brown accused her husband of assault. According to the Houston Press, Rachel made prior complaints against Brown at least three times: in 2003, 2006, and 2009.

She filed for divorce on January 7, 2011.Â 

In
 January, he was accused of choking a flight attendant and threatening 
to strip naked on a flight from London to Miami and in September, he was
 sentenced to a 30-day prison sentence he had yet to serve.

The flight attendant told 
authorities that she was able to pull away from Brown's grasp but 
alleged that his behavior continued after she returned to serve him 
some food.

In court: Brown had appeared in court multiple times over the years for assault and lost his license in 2006 after failing a cocaine test. Most recently, he pleaded guilty to choking a flight attendant in January

A criminal complaint said that Brown knocked over the meal as he wrapped 
his hands around her neck, began to squeeze, and asked her 'are you a
 strong woman?'

The Chronicle reported that Brown 
then said he was going to 'get naked' and remarked about the 'sexual' 
things he wanted to do to the women.

Eventually,
 the flight crew was able to get Brown calm, and he soon fell asleep for
 the remainder of the flight. When the plane landed, he was taken into 
custody and pleaded guilty to related charges.

As he became embroiled in court cases, his dependency on prescription drugs also became evident and he spent time at an addiction rehab center.

In July, a judge ordered he be 
arrested for contempt of court for the second time after once again 
skipping a hearing related to their divorce. It is not clear how the divorce will now be resolved.
