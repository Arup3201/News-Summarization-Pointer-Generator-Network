Britain's most powerful civil servant will help choose the next chairman of the BBC Trust.

Sir Jeremy Heywood will be part of a three-strong interview panel for the £110,000 post, vacated by Lord Patten in May.

His involvement in what is proving to be a difficult recruitment process emerged as the job description was quietly altered.

It has been tweaked so the time commitment is less onerous, and the deadline for applications has been extended.

One theory is this could make the post more attractive for candidates such as Lord Coe – who may have been deterred by the requirement to work three to four days per week (12 to 16 days per month).

But in the past week it has changed to state: ‘Suitable candidates able to offer a lesser time commitment will also be considered.’ The deadline for applications was already extended by a week and closes today.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which is overseeing the appointment, announced last night that Sir Jeremy would be ‘representing the Government’ in the selection process.

Alongside him will be former BBC executive Carolyn Fairbairn, who now works for ITV, and an independent peer, Lord Kakkar.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy has been associated with a range of controversies over his career, earning him the nickname Sir Cover-up.

Most recently, he vetoed the release to the Chilcot inquiry of letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war.

The 
contents of 150 messages - believed to reveal the real reason the former
 prime minister dragged Britain into the conflict - will be censored.

Sir Jeremy, 52, was also responsible for the first, bungled Downing Street response to the Plebgate scandal.

BBC insiders last night questioned why he has been asked to help choose the next Trust chairman.

The move to lighten the next BBC Trust chairman's workload has sparked speculation that the Government is hoping to lure Lord Coe, pictured, to the post

One said: ‘Jeremy Heywood has no background in media. On the surface this seems an odd appointment.’

When Lord Patten was chosen in 2011, the interview panel comprised ex-BP chief Lord Browne, ex-ITN chief Stewart Purvis, and DCMS permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.

The move to lighten the next chairman’s workload has sparked speculation that the Government is hoping to lure Lord Coe, who it had been thought would struggle to juggle the role if he becomes president of the International Association of Athletics Federations.

Acting BBC Trust chairman Diane Coyle is the only publicly confirmed candidate.

Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, which will have a hearing to vet the Government’s preferred candidate, said of the change to the job description: ‘It gives the impression government have already made up their mind about who they want but that person can’t commit the time so they are moving the goal posts. To do this so last minute and with no transparency is extremely alarming.’

A spokesman for the Commissioner for Public Appointments said the changes to the job description had been cleared by public appointments assessor Mark Addison.
