Emma Cadywould was struggling to cope after giving birth to baby Harrison, and was woken sometimes as much as 20 times a night, an inquest heard

The wife of an army major who was killed by a speeding train was suffering from 'one of the worst cases of post-natal depression' a coroner had ever seen, he told an inquest into her death.

New mother Emma Cadywould had battled the condition for six months before she drove to a railway line where she was hit by a train. 

Mrs Cadywould, known to friends as Emsie, was struggling to cope after giving birth to baby Harrison, who woke her up through the night, the court heard.

Despite support from family, including husband Steve, and from friends, she regularly told loved ones she wanted to be at peace and expressed suicidal thoughts, it was said.

She was prescribed anti-depressants to cope with the strain, which had also taken a physical toll, as she started to lose her hair.

Swindon Coroners' Court heard that on December 16, 2011, she left from her home in Watchfield, next to the UK Defence Academy, on the Oxfordshire-Wiltshire border.

Mrs Cadywould drove four miles towards Swindon, Wiltshire, where she parked near the village of South Marston and made her way onto the main railway linking London with the West Country.

Shortly afterwards she was struck by a train.  The driver had been partially blinded by the sun, and thinking he might have hit a deer, he continued to Swindon station.

The damage to the train led to a investigation further back down the tracks, it was said.

Major Cadywould told the hearing how he and his wife had been 'rapidly ejected' from Swindon’s Great Western Hospital following Harrison’s birth.

'We left after four hours. It was made clear to us at the beginning that they have a quick turnaround,' he said.

'I think it was quite a shock - the whole process.'

He added: 'As time elapsed Harrison was difficult to get into a routine.

'The whole night from day, day from night, feeding. There was no routine. She found that very difficult with broken sleep.

'He was a very fretful baby. He would wake 10 to 20 times in the night. Sometimes there would be 20 minutes between his waking.'

Mrs Cadywould had 'one of the worst cases of post-natal depression' a coroner had ever seen, he told an inquest

Both took it in turns to look after Harrison but his father began to take further responsibility when Mrs Cadywould couldn’t cope.

'There was a sudden change,' he said.

'The first time the crisis team arrived and Emma went to stay with her parents.

'I then went to take over full-time responsibility of Harrison. I think it had come to a point she could no longer cope.

'Physically she was okay, but mentally she wasn’t coping. She suffered some hair loss late on.'

The couple were married in December 2007 and Harrison was born on June 1, 2011.

The Major told the court he had breakfast with his wife and she dressed their baby and later drove him to nursery.

They had discussed 'normal domestic' issues, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.

Despite support from family, including husband Steve (pictured), and from friends, she regularly told loved ones she wanted to be at peace and expressed suicidal thoughts, it was said

Major Cadywould, who had been taking military commander exams in the days, said: 'I believe she took care to conceal it [her suicidal thoughts] from me.

'She didn’t even tell me about the way she was feeling so I was unaware she had those thoughts.

'She didn’t talk to me about thinking about harming herself.'

The University of Bristol researcher for the department of East Asian studies later died at about 10.30am that day.

Train driver Christopher Woodley was at the controls of the cab of the train from London Paddington to Bristol Temple Meads when he heard a 'loud bang'.

Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic)

Feeling 'low' after having a baby, also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND).

It usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite severe.

Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to
cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby.  
They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel 
hopeless about the future.

Many of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and to be less severe.

Treatments for PND include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered for short-term use.

Some women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Practical and emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an antidepressant.

Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 Monday-Friday 10am-2pm.

Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401.

Other telephone helplines available 24 hours a day include Parentline on 0808 800 2222 or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90.

He went on: 'A loud bang was heard at the front of the train but I did not see what caused the noise.

'The sun was very bright, light was shining into the cab.'

A post-mortem examination revealed that Mrs Cadywould, of Watchfield, had died from 'multiple injuries from an impact.'

Toxicology results showed prescription anti-depressants in her bloodstream.

Peter Hatvany, the assistant coroner for
Wiltshire and Swindon, said: 'This is one of, if not the, worst cases 
of post natal depression I have ever seen.'

Despite the evidence, he stressed: 'Only she knew why she made her way to the railway line that morning.'

He recorded a narrative verdict into her death.

Her family said the verdict was the best they could have expected and they vowed to continue to raise awareness into the condition which blighted Mrs Cadywould.

'No mother should have to die from post-natal depression,' they said.

Mrs Cadywould's sister Lucie Holland has set up a website to raise funds for the Association for Post-Natal Illness.

On her Just Giving page she wrote: 'Emma was tragically lost by all who loved and cherished her due to an illness which is wildly unacknowledged or taken less seriously than it should be...

'In the UK one mother a week will be totally overwhelmed by post-natal depression and will tragically be lost to a loving family.  PND is a silent killer.

She added: 'Emma I love you always.  The world is not as fun without you, but I am lucky to have had you as my Sister.'
