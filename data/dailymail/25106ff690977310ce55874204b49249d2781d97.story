Male life expectancy has risen at the rate of six hours a day over the past 30 years, a study shows.

Lifespans are increasing so rapidly that a boy born in 28 days’ time will – on average – live a week longer than a boy born today.

Life expectancy for women, meanwhile, is rising at the rate of four hours a day, according to analysts at the Office for National Statistics.

Boys born in England and Wales in 2011 are likely to live for an average of 78.7 years, nearly eight years more than a male child born at the beginning of the 1980s.

Women continue to live longer than men. A newborn girl in 2011 can expect to reach the age of 82.6 years  – six years more than their counterparts from the 1980s.

The unprecedented changes have multiplied the numbers of older people in the population and seen men close the lifespan advantage enjoyed by women.

Medical advances and the transformation of the economy have led to people eating more healthily and living in better heated and more comfortable homes.

Men are also more likely to work in safe and air-conditioned offices than in polluted industrial plants.

The ONS report said: ‘One major factor is the improvements in mortality from circulator diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, partly driven by changing smoking habits and medical and technological advances.

‘People who are younger than 60 have also benefited from a lifetime of NHS health care.’

The report gave estimates of life expectancy covering the years between 2009 and 2011.

It said the gap between life expectancy at birth for boys and girls had narrowed from six years in 1980/82 to the four years estimated in the latest count.

Over the past 30 years, it said, life expectancy at birth has gone up by six hours a day for boys and four hours a day for girls.

Nine out of ten boys can now expect to live to reach the age of 65 – a retirement point now being raised because of rising life expectancy. Fewer than three quarters of those born in the early 1980s could expect to reach retirement age.

‘Life expectancy at birth in England and Wales has reached its highest level on record for both males and females,’ the report said. Life expectancy has been rising since the industrial revolution transformed the living standards of most. By 1901, men could expect to reach the age of 45 and women 49.

Two world wars and the economic slump between them dragged down lifespans only temporarily and life expectancy has been rising smoothly since the early 1960s.
