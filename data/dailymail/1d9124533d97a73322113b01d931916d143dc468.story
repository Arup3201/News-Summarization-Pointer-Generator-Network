Giving it all away: Oprah plans to auction off 500 belongings from her Chicago apartment next month

Just two weeks after announcing she was closing her studios in Chicago, Oprah Winfrey is now planning to auction off all of the art in her luxe apartment in the city. 

On Monday, Leslie Hindman Auctioneers announced the sale of some 500 belongings in Oprah's Water Tower Place Condo.

The items will be previewed starting April 16, with bidding starting on April 25. 

In true Oprah fashion, the proceeds from the auction will go towards a good cause: her Leadership Academy Foundation which runs a school for girls in South Africa.

'People love Oprah,' Hindman told the Chicago Tribune. 'There's something for everyone. There's things that are $100 and things up to $100,000.'

Included in the sale will be Oprah's collection of English, French and Continental furniture, decorative arts, paintings, prints, drawings, porcelain, crystal, silver, memorabilia, clothing, accessories and even a bike - one of the cheaper objects up for grabs at around $200-$400 estimated value.

On the higher end of the spectrum is a Richard Miller Painting which could go for between $80,000 and $120,000. 

Oprah put her 9,625-square-foot Water Tower Place condo on the market for $7.75million, but some reports say she has since taken it down. 

She moved into the apartment in 1985, five years before Harpo Studio was opened to film her talk show. 

Earlier this month, she announced that Harpo would be closing by the end of this year. Oprah left Chicago in 2011 to start her network, OWN.  

For a good cause: The proceeds of the auction will benefit her education charity, which runs a school for girls in South Africa, Above, one of the belongs up for auction, a painting by Hovsep Pusman titled 'The Little Mother'. The painting has an estimated value of $30,000 to $50,000
