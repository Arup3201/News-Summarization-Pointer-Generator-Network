Neymar perhaps lucky to just get yellow. He looks for the opportunity but has an open hand so there is no power in the contact with Luka Modric. Heâ€™s not endangering his opponent and so a yellow card is a sensible decision by the referee.

Croatia manager Niko Kovac blasted referee Yuichi Nishimura for his poor performance during the opening match of the 2014 World Cup.

The Japanese official had a night to forget, allowing Neymar to stay on the pitch following a cynical elbow on Luka Modric in the first-half, before awarding the tournament hosts a soft penalty and disallowing what looked like a legitimate equaliser by Croatia.

Kovac said Nishimura was out of his depth and that someone else should have been appointed to officiate if he wasn't up to the job.

Kovac said: 'I must say 
the referee was completely out of his depth.

'If
 someone's not up to scratch to referee the first game then find someone
 else. Two and a half billion people saw this wasn't a penalty.'

Brazil
 No 10 Neymar added a strand of Barcelona vs Real Madrid El Clasico 
spice to proceedings when he elbowed Croatian playmaker Luka Modric.

The duo went up for an aerial ball and Neymar appeared to look at Modric before placing his forearm towards the Croatian's head.

Nishimura
 reached into his pocket and the host nation breathed a collective sigh 
of relief as he brandished a yellow card to Brazil's golden boy.

In
 the 71st minute the decision which arguably settled the game came when 
Nishimura adjudged Dejan Lovren to have fouled Fred in the area and 
awarded a penalty.

Up 
stepped Neymar to dispatch the spot-kick and score his second goal of 
the game, but Croatia players were rightly incandescent with a harsh 
decision for a very soft foul.

As
 Croatia continued to trouble the Brazilian rearguard, Ivica Olic jumped
 with Julio Cesar in the 81st minute and his challenge kept the ball out
 of the Brazil goalkeeper's grasp before the ball ended up in the back 
of the net.

However, Nishimura had already blown his whistle for what he believed to be Olic's foul on Cesar.

Gary Lineker tweeted: 'It's a tight call for Brazil's man of the match between Neymar and the Referee.'

While Fabrice Muamba also tweeted on the matter, saying: 'After that shocking decision I will be very surprise if this referee take charge of another game in this World Cup.'

Rub of the green: Fred appeared to go down easily under the challenge of Dejan Lovren

Spot-kick: The referee deemed Lovren's challenge to be worthy of a penalty to Brazil

Under fire: Referee Nishimura was not popular with the Croatia players after awarding Brazil a penalty

Legitimate: Ivica Olic was deemed to have impeded Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar with this challenge

Unlucky: Olic jumped with his hands by his sides and headed the ball fairly under attention from Cesar

Blasted: Nishimura again felt the wrath of the Croatia players after another decision went against them
