Roy Hodgson has revealed that Arsene Wenger rang him for advice before signing Danny Welbeck for £16m on transfer deadline day - and that he is delighted that his strong recommendation paid off for both Arsenal and Welbeck.

Wenger has since said that he only appreciated quite how good a player Welbeck was after seeing him close up every day in training - and Hodgson says he gave similar feedback to the Arsenal manager when Wenger was weighing up whether to buy Welbeck or not last August.

Hodgson said: 'Arsene and I speak more often than most managers as he always comes up to the directors' box at Arsenal and I speak to him very often. And we spoke of course before he signed Danny. I was singing Danny's praise so I'm delighted that Arsene has seen that my judgement wasn't wrong and that he shares that judgement.

'We like Danny very much. We've always shown faith in Danny. Many times he's been selected by me and my staff when he was not actually playing for Manchester United. Sometimes he's not even been on the bench and yet still we' ve selected him because we think he has the qualities required.

'And what Danny really needs is the faith of his manager, which he obviously has from Arsene, to get more games. And then I think we'll see more and more performances from him that we've been lucky enough to see with England and Arsenal were lucky enough to see the other night when he played at Monaco. I thought he was really, really good.'

Welbeck is likely to start for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania next Friday. He made 24 starts for Manchester United last season and since moving to Arsenal on transfer deadline day has already started 25 times with at least eleven games remaining, which Hodgson believes is benefitting the England player.

'Arsene has used him and he's played quite a lot of games if you compare it to the games he played for Man United. With us he's always done what I think is a very, very good job for the team. There aren't many times when he's played for England where I've been disappointed in him or in his work rate or desire. But of course it would be great if he gets himself as one of the first names on the Arsenal team sheet and play for them every week, that would be a bonus certainly for him and it won't do us any harm.

'I'm pretty sure he must have benefitted (from Wenger's confidence in him). But it's not something that has struck me like a bolt of lightning, that's for sure. When he's come with us he's not lacked confidence ever. He knows what we want from him. And he knows that he can deliver what we want from him. He knows that we believe in him. I've never felt he's ever come to us with a massive lack of confidence.'
