They’re two of the biggest names in fashion, an iconic duo that have been friends and colleagues for over two decades.

So it’s no wonder Vivienne Westwood has a few things to say about her admiration for long-time pal, Kate Moss.

In a video to celebrate Kate Moss’ new collection for Topshop, the designer Dame gushes about the supermodel, saying: ‘She’s got a big aura that she draws you in.'

Oh so close: Kate and Vivienne cuddle up and the designer says talking to her is like 'being in a conspiracy'

'Every time she speaks to me I feel like we’re in a conspiracy. It’s so intimate that you just want to know what you're going to be doing together.'

A set of eight videos have been created by NOWNESS and directed by Leigh Johnson to tie in with Kate’s new range for the high street giant, which hits stores on 30 April.

In the latest video, seen on Grazia Daily, Vivienne is filmed backstage at her fashion show with her husband Andreas Kronthaler.

And she has a few quirky observations to make about the world's most famous supermodel. 

'I’ve never
 seen anybody with more far apart eyes than she’s got,’ says the 
designer, who is regarded as one of the most iconic British fashion 
designers and a pioneer of punk fashion.

‘There’s something so attractive about her.’

On Kate’s dress sense she mused: ‘I think she’s one of the most stylish people that treads the planet.

‘She loves fashion, she understands clothes and she knows how to work clothes.

‘She’s just got it.'

Talking about her iconic pirate boots the Dame continued: ‘Kate bought a pair of those boots and everybody wanted them.'

And the designer, synonymous with British fashion since the 1970s, said: 'Britishness is in our bones.

'That’s 
what happens.

'We’re patriotic in the sense that we love the English 
countryside.

'I like London for it’s culture, museums and the River 
Thames. It’s a repository of a great civilisation.'

As well as Vivienne Westwood, Kate’s celebrity pals Bobby Gillespie, Nick Grimshaw, Beth Ditto, Charlotte Tilbury, Cara Delevingne and mother and daughter duo Amanda and Tallulah Harlech have all spoken in short videos about their relationship with Kate and why they love her.

Celebrity fan: Nick Grimshaw and Kate Moss at a dinner in 2012. The radio presenter describes Kate's style as 'effortless' in his video dedicated to her

Beth Ditto calls her a ‘skinny bitch!’, whilst Nick Grimshaw praised her style as ‘effortless.’

‘She treats everyone the same,’ he said.

‘Whether she’s hanging out with my Dad or Donatella Versace, you get the same Kate Moss.

He also remembered drunkenly getting a tattoo with Kate, but she persuaded him not to get one of Bart Simpson, much to his delight the morning after.

The radio presenter laughed as he said: ‘She called me up and said, “Now are you happy you didn’t get that tattoo?!” Yes Kate.’
