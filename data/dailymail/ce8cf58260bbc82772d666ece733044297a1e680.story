A never-before-seen video shows the moment Barack Obama reunited with his half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo after two decades apart.

Ndesandjo, who shares the same father as the president, decided to surprise his half-brother right before a debate with Hillary Clinton in the lead up to the 2008 elections.

The half-brothers had met on only one prior occasion, when Obama visited his father's family in Kenya in 1988.

The video obtained by Inside Edition shows candidate Obama entering the room, seeing his brother and looking extremely surprised.

Shocked: President Obama saw his brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo for the first time in 20 years before a debate with Hillary Clinton in 2008

Surprised: Ndesandjo showed up out of the blue, flying from his home in China to Texas for the debate

'How are you? Good to see you,' Obama says as he goes up to hug his brother and slap him on the back. 'How you been man?'

'It was amazing,' Ndesandjo recalled of the reunion. 'We just laughed and we hugged each other and we were brothers.'

President Obama is Ndesandjo's older half-brother. Their father, Barack Obama Sr, married Ndesanjo's mother Ruth Baker a few months after divorcing the president's mother, Ann Dunham.

The home video was released as Ndesandjo works to publicize his new autobiography, Cultures: My Odyssey of Self-Discovery, which gives a shocking new perspective on the president's father.

While the president didn't grow up with his father, Ndesandjo and his mother moved with Obama Sr back to Kenya where he spent his childhood.

Different lives: While the president grew up without his father, Ndesandjo and his mother Ruth Baker moved to Kenya with Barack Obama Sr. On the left, a young Barack Obama with his father on his one visit to Hawaii in the 1970s. On the  right, Obama Sr and Ndesandjo's mother Ruth Baker

In his book he remembers his father as abusive and a violent alcoholic.

'I remember seeing my mother on the floor on one occasion with a knife to her throat,' he said.

He says he left his bedroom door open most night and would hear his father come home to beat up his mother and the scent of Johnny Walker Black Label on his breath.

In 1973, Ruth Baker divorced Obama Sr and remarried another Kenyan man and Ndesandjo took his step-father's last name.

Barack Obama Sr died in a car accident in Nairobi, Kenya in 1982 at the age of 46.

Despite his troubled childhood, Ndesandjo went on to study at Brown, got his Masters from Stanford and an MBA from Emory.

Big move: Ndesandjo moved to China in 2002 and is now married to a Chinese woman and speaks the language fluently

In 2002 he moved to Shenzen, China 'looking for a new life' and seems to have found it, marrying a Chinese woman and learning the language. 

While his new book may reveal some embarrassing details of the elder Obama's life, Ndesandjo doesn't believe it will spark any animosity from his powerful half-brother.

'He said to me before he became a politician, 'Mark, go live your life and don't worry about me,' and that's what I'm doing,' Ndesandjo said.
