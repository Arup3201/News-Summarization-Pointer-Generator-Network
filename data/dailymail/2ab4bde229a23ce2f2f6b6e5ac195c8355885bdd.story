Police officer Darren Wilson has said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into the shooting of Michael Brown will find 'nothing' and clear him just as a Missouri grand jury did earlier this week.

The Justice Department continues to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead 18-year-old unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force.

During his interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Wilson insisted he had never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career.

'I did my job and followed my training,' Wilson said. 'The training took over.'

However, the FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson, and a broader inquiry has been launched into the police practices of the overwhelmingly white Ferguson force, which operates in a predominantly black community.

Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding, that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the St. Louis County, and will remain so.

'While the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing,' Attorney General Eric Holder , 63, said.

'In addition, the Department continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.'

Wilson, speaking to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on Tuesday, admitted that he's worried about there being a federal criminal investigation, but is confident investigators will find 'nothing' to suggest he broke the law.

'I stand by what I did,' he said. 'I stand by my training, and just have to wait and see what they determine.'

Stephanopoulos asked Wilson: 'You're confident that no charges will be brought?'

Wilson responded, 'Yeah.'

To win a criminal conviction on civil rights charges, federal prosecutors would need to prove that Wilson intended to violate Brown's rights when he shot and killed him on August 9.

'The bar is very high,' said Jennifer Laurin, a University of Texas law professor. She added, though, that federal prosecutors do not always see things the way local prosecutors do.

Without a criminal indictment, Brown's family might have no better legal recourse than to sue local authorities over the teenager's fatal shooting.

After a St. Louis County grand jury decided on Monday not to indict officer Wilson - and given the high bar to a federal criminal prosecution - the family may follow the path of other high-profile U.S. police shootings and file a civil lawsuit for wrongful death or civil rights violations.

In some such cases, the authorities who oversee police departments agree to settle for millions of dollars.

'There might be a lot of political forces that would be at work that would give the Brown family a chance at a quick settlement,' said New York lawyer and former prosecutor Paul Callan.

The burden of proof in a U.S. civil suit is lower than in a criminal case. A plaintiff needs to show liability only by the preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.

In recent years, New York City agreed to pay $7.15 million to the family and friends of Sean Bell; Chicago agreed to a $4.1 million settlement with the family of Flint Farmer; and a California transit agency said it would pay $2.8 million to the family of Oscar Grant, according to news reports at the time.

All three men were shot to death by police officers in cases that drew widespread attention but not murder convictions.

Rodney King sued Los Angeles after his videotaped 1991 beating by police, and a jury awarded him $3.8 million.

'There are so few cases in which officers are criminally charged, but plenty of instances in which very successful civil rights cases are brought,' said Joanna Schwartz, a UCLA law professor.

Daryl Parks, a lawyer for the Brown family, said on CNN on Tuesday that the family was focused on the Justice Department investigation, not getting money from the city, but would explore legal options including a wrongful death lawsuit. 'That will have its day,' he said.

Ferguson Assistant City Manager Pam Hylton declined to comment on any possible suit.

If the family brought a civil lawsuit, a jury would essentially be asked to determine whether Wilson acted 'reasonably' when he shot Brown, Schwartz said.

And although the grand jury appears to have accepted Wilson's self-defense claims, that does not necessarily mean a trial jury would do so in a civil lawsuit, said Peter Joy, a law professor and director of the criminal justice clinic at Washington University in St. Louis.

The deadline to file a lawsuit would be two to five years, depending on the type of claim and whether it was under state or federal law, said St. Louis lawyer Stephen Ryals.

Brown's family members could sue Wilson and city officials on behalf of either themselves, Brown's estate, or both.

The suit could seek compensation for economic damages such as lost future income and funeral and burial expenses, as well as punitive damages, according to similar suits in past cases.

The family could sue based on wrongful death or deprivation of civil rights, said Callan, who represented the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson in a wrongful death lawsuit against former athlete O.J. Simpson. 

After a jury acquitted Simpson of murder, a civil jury in 1997 found him liable for the deaths of his former wife and her friend Ronald Goldman and ordered Simpson to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims' families.

A claim on either theory would be difficult to win, Callan said, because of conflicting witness accounts and physical evidence Wilson acted in self-defense. 

What other investigations are underway?

The FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations. Investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution. 

Whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges, Justice Department lawyers have a single focus: whether it can be shown that Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights. 

That is a difficult burden to meet, especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force. Some other past high-profile police shootings, including the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo in New York City, did not result in federal prosecutions.

What about broader allegations of racial insensitivity on the part of the Ferguson police department?

Beyond the shooting itself, the Justice Department is conducting a wide-reaching investigation into the practices of the entire department. 

That investigation is focusing on stops, searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department. It has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the Ferguson force. 

Such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation.

The Justice Department has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years, or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that.

And regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, there's also the potential that Brown's family could file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wilson.

How long might these other investigations go on?

The Justice Department has not set a timeline for either investigation, though outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder has said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office. 

He said late on Monday that that investigation was independent of the local probe, and that 'we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence.'

How will authorities deal with any protests?

President Barack Obama appealed for calm and understanding Monday after the no-indictment announcement, saying the country needed 'to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make.' Holder, too, said the decision should not lead to violence. Even so, within minutes of the announcement, crowds in the streets of Ferguson shattered windows, vandalized cars and taunted police while officers released smoke and pepper spray to disperse the gatherings.

In anticipation of the protests, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon pre-emptively declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. Gun sales surged before the grand jury decision and some shop owners boarded up their stores. A federal law enforcement team has been working with top commanders in Ferguson and from neighboring police departments to help reduce tensions and build trust.

Are there longer-term efforts to deal with underlying problems?

Nixon several days ago named 16 members to a panel aimed at helping the community heal after the shooting. The commission, which will study underlying social and economic conditions, is expected to make recommendations in a report due by September 2015.
