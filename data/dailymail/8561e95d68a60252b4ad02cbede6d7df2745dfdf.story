They say a woman's work is never done - and she's not likely to get much help from her husband either, according to a new study.

Researchers have found that more than half of men would not be prepared to swap roles with their wives or girlfriends, with many put off by the thought of running the home, juggling childcare with work and planning weekly meals.

Men also confessed that they would would dread having to undertake the weekly food shop, getting children ready for school, cleaning, and managing household bills.

And one in three of the men polled by Co-operative Food admitted they had the easy option in life, with 43 per cent claiming they have 'no idea' how their partner is able to multi-task so efficiently.

'Men seem very reluctant to swap roles with their partners,' said Janet Taylor, Diet and Health Manager for Co-operative Food.

'Even though, in many households, 
women also have full-time jobs, it seems that lots of other chores, 
including housework, running around after the kids and making sure 
everyone is organised, often falls to the female.

'Despite
 our differences, men and women are generally happy with their roles - 
and, as we all know, the key to running an efficient and healthy 
household is always teamwork.'

The survey was commissioned to celebrate the supermarket's support for the government's Change4Life Smart Swaps campaign, which encourages families to consider switching unhealthy treats for alternatives that are lower in fat and sugar.

Participants were also quizzed on which celebrities they would like to switch lives with, with most men saying they would like to have David Beckham's life, and women wanting to be like presenter Holly Willoughby.

Other top picks included music mogul Simon Cowell, and racing driver Jenson Button for men, while women would also like to experience the lifestyles of Victoria Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge.

'It
 was interesting to see that women would swap places with busy working 
mother Holly Willoughby, whilst men would switch with multi-talented David 
Beckham, who manages to combine worldwide fame with family commitments,'
 said Ms Taylor.

The study of 1,000 men and 1,000 
women showed that 56 per cent of men believe they would find it hard if 
they had to juggle work with childcare every day.

Just
 under half of the men polled were more than happy to let their partner 
cook every night, and 46 per cent liked their wives or girlfriends to be
 responsible for the weekly food shop.

In
 four in 10 households, women are solely responsible for the running of 
the house - and clean, pack lunch boxes, book appointments, take the 
children to clubs and get up in the night if the kids wake.

A
 further seven in 10 men would also dislike having to impress friends 
and family with their hosting skills and ability to run a beautiful 
house with perfect children.

Interestingly, despite their busy lifestyles, only 27 per cent of women would change their lives and swap with their other half.

More
 than half of women claim that although their partners have less to 
juggle on a daily basis, they are quite happy with their lot.

And
 two thirds of women acknowledged the fact they probably couldn't do 
their partner's job, with six in 10 claiming his job was far more 
stressful than their average day at home.

A further one third of women also said their other half would be utterly useless in their role.

When asked what they'd most like to swap about their lives, 40 per cent of women said would like to swap their body for a leaner one, while 28 per cent said they would change where they live.

Men said they would like to swap their UK home for one abroad (29 per cent), and 23 per cent wished for a change of career.

Ms Taylor added: 'We are encouraging our customers to join us in supporting the Change4Life Smart Swaps initiative with great deals on a wide variety of healthier products.

'Recommended swaps include swapping sugary drinks for diet or sugar-free versions, water or lower fat milk; swapping cheese to reduced fat cheese, swapping butter for lower fat butter or spreads; swapping sugary cereals to plain porridge, whole wheat cereal biscuits or plain shredded whole grain, and swapping whole milk to semi-skimmed.'
