Shola Ameobi agreed to join Crystal Palace in a deal that will see him reunited with former Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew.

The striker left Turkish club Gaziantep in December and Selhurst Park has been his preferred destination for a Barclays Premier League return despite interest from West Bromwich Albion.

Ameobi scored 79 goals in 397 appearances for Newcastle before leaving St James’ Park last year after 14 years.

Palace next face Everton at home on Saturday and Pardew hopes to secure the services of Ameobi as soon as possible.

The forward has been tracked by Hull as well but he always hoped to play under his ex-boss.

Ameobi scored four goals in 11 games for Gaziantep but the club suffered financial difficulties and had to cut his stay short. As a free agent he can join a club even after the January window closes.
