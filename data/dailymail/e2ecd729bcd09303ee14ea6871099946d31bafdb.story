What should have been a colourful debate on This Morning turned nasty today when the sex therapist invited onto the show unleashed a personal attack on the show's resident agony aunt. 

Louise van der Velde, who recently spoke out to slam marriage as 'for mugs' appeared on the breakfast show to defend her claims that marriage is an outdated concept - and that couples would be much happier if they were allowed to seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere. 

But when the This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson replied that she believed unless both couples agreed on an open marriage they should remain faithful, Louise van der Velde turned on her, calling her 'out of touch' and an 'old battleaxe'.

Head to head: Louise van der Velde takes on Denise Robertson over the matter of adultery within marriage - and ends up calling her an 'out of touch battleaxe'

Denise, who is a formidable woman at the best of times, looked reasonably shocked by the outburst - but Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were horrified.

'No one insults our Denise,' said Phillip, as Holly turned away from Louise, saying that actually Denise gave excellent advice.

The insult came about after Louise had spoken out to defend her choice to have four lovers. But as a single woman, Phillip argued Louise was welcome to have as many lovers as she liked.

Denise agreed, saying, 'If a single person wants to have sex with74 people in a week, it's none of my business.

'If a married couple agree they both want to have sex elsewhere, it's none of my business. But when one person in a marriage wants to sleep with someone else but the other doesn't, it can cause great pain.

Open: Louise, who has four lovers, extolls the virtues of an open marriage, saying men and women should be able to seek sex elsewhere

Outburst: Denise looked shocked when Louise unleashed a torrent of abuse

'I know from the letters I receive the agony that it causes when one member of a couple is unfaithful,' Denise went on.

But Louise took umbrage at her words - and let her know in no uncertain terms.

'You are a battleaxe,' she told a stunned Denise. 'You need to get with the modern times. You're an "agony" aunt. You deal with agony.

'Things have changed. Having an open marriage doesn't have to be agony.'

Louise went on to say she believes there is too much pressure on people to get married - meaning too many of use end up trapped in unhappy unions - something she has referred to as the 'prison' of marriage. 

'If you find the right partner from the off, you won't have that problem,' she says, adding that seeking a lover elsewhere can be the perfect antidote to an unhappy marriage.

'What's wrong with that?' she asks. 'Make yourself feel great. It can help people to lift their vibrations.'

But, argues Denise, doesn't that mean you are simply trapped in a prison of a marriage, but you have the added pain of not knowing where your partner is, or with whom?

Trouncing: Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were shocked by Louise's personal attack on Denise, and took great pleasure in reading out the poll results that proved the viewers sided with their agony aunt

'If your marriage is a prison, you should get out,' says Denise. 'I'm all in favour of getting a divorce and having a new beginning, if that's the right thing to do.

'No one should be trapped in a marriage they consider to be a prison.'

At the end of the debate, with Phillip and Holly shell-shocked and Denise storing up some choice words she later said she could easily have unleashed on Louise, the presenters turned to the viewers poll to see whether they agreed with Louise and her take on marriage, or with Denise.

Unsurprisingly, 93 per cent of the viewers sided with Denise, while just seven per cent were on Louise's side.

Phillip and Holly took great pleasure in highlighting the disparity, telling Louise they believed it was the most convincing defeat in the history of the show.

As Phillip said, nobody messes with our Denise.

After the show, Louise said: 'My argument on the show, and which I make in my book, is that people have to find the relationship model which works for them.

'If you still believe a relationship model which is 300 years old is still relevant today then perhaps you are a battleaxe.

'I don't regret what I said to Denise. Her model is outdated and I don't think she lives in the real world.

'She needs to see how many affairs are going on out there. She is out of touch.

She is very stuck in her beliefs about the traditional relationship model and won't accept any new ideas.'
