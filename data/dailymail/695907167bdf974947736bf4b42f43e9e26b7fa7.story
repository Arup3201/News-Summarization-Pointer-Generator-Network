This was the dramatic moment when a ship sank today after hitting another tug boat, prompting fears that 200 tonnes of diesel could leak and pollute the English Riviera's finest beaches.

As the  decommissioned 260ft Moto Vessel Emsstrom went down off the coast of Devon this afternoon, engineers and seaman were onboard the Christos 22 and pumping water from it.

Eight crew members were rescued after the Christos 22 - travelling from Germany to Turkey - was damaged by the vessel it was towing as it tried to anchor a mile off Hope's Nose in Torbay last night.

Danger: The Christos 22, pictured centre between two other tug boats, contains about 200 tonnes of diesel and is awaiting repairs before it can be towed to safety after taking on water off Hope's Nose, near Torbay, Devon

Sinking feeling: The Moto Vessel Emsstrom - which was being towed by the Christos 22 - lists in the sea after it damaged the tug boat in waters off Hope's Nose

Going down: The Moto Vessel Emsstrom eventually sank in the sea off Hope's Nose, near Torbay, Devon

Christos 22 had pulled into the 
coastline in order to check a problem with the tow when it was hit, had a
16-inch gash torn in its side and began taking on water rapidly.

The
Moto Vessel Emsstrom, the decommissioned vessel being towed by the tug,
became separated and later sank. But that boat went down in deep 
water without fuel on board, so it will not be a threat to shipping - and join other wrecks on the seabed as a diving attraction.

A
Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: ‘Salvors are onboard the
tug Christos 22. Pumping operations continue to go well. Divers now 
deployed to inspect and repair.’

She said the situation has become more stable after it was confirmed at first light that there were no reports of pollution.

Location: The incident happened on Sunday night at around 8pm off Hope's Nose in Torbay, Devon

A Brixham Coastguard spokesman said: ‘The problem is this is happening quite close to shore and if this boat sinks there could be a big pollution problem.

‘There is a lot of diesel on the boat, and there's a good chance the diesel would leak if it sinks. It would contaminate the local beaches - all this part of the coast is a holiday coastline.

‘It is also a fishing area and would impact on the local birds and wildlife.’

He added that if the boat cannot be saved the Royal Navy ships will instead begin the ‘difficult’ task of pumping diesel out of the water.

Two lifeboats have been at the scene with HMS Lancaster and the navy vessel HMS Severn and a second tug, the MTS Vulcan, is standing by.

If the sinking Christos 22 cannot be saved Royal Navy ships will instead start pumping diesel out of the water.

'There is still potentially quite a big problem with 200 tonnes of diesel oil and some heavy oils on board. Realistically now we're just trying to keep the boat afloat and hoping there is no pollution'

RNLI spokesman

Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) spokesman Mark Criddle said: ‘Our priority was making sure all the people on board were accounted for and that we could get them off if we needed to.

‘Both vessels have got problems, one is listing and the other has taken on a large amount of water. The engine room is almost flooded in the tug.

‘There is still potentially quite a big problem with 200 tonnes of diesel oil and some heavy oils on board. Realistically now we're just trying to keep the boat afloat and hoping there is no pollution.’
