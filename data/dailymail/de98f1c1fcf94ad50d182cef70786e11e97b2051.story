A peeping tom caught trying to 
spy on female members of the Chinese swimming team as they prepared for 
the Olympic Games is to be sentenced next month.

Declan Crosbie, 25, locked himself in a toilet cubicle in the women's changing room hoping to catch a glimpse of the swimmers.

But he was caught out when three members of the team spotted him and 
reported him to staff at The Edge sports centre on the University of Leeds 
campus.

Peeping Tom: Declan Crosbie was caught trying to spy on female members of the Chinese Olympic swimming team at The Edge sports centre in Leeds

He had been due to be sentenced this month after pleading guilty to trespassing with intent to commit a sexual offense, but his hearing at Leeds Crown Court has been delayed until September 17.

Last month, Leeds Magistrates Court heard that when staff approached the locked toilet Crosbie attempted to answer them in a woman's voice.

When he exited, he was found to be 'dressed smartly, carrying a rucksack' with 'his fly undone'.

Karen Williams, prosecuting, said: 'At 11.30 in the morning, the receptionist at the university sports centre was made aware of a male in the female changing room.'

The receptionist, duty manager and a security guard at the sports centre, one of two in the city hosting Olympic swimming teams, went down to investigate.

Ms Williams continued: 'When they challenged him, he answered in a lady’s voice.'

When he heard that the police were being called Crosbie, from Leeds, broke free and escaped from the sports centre. He was later apprehended by police.

Crosbie, who has previous convictions for voyeurism and was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life in 2009, pleaded guilty to one charge of trespassing with intent to commit a sexual offence and will be sentenced next month.

Serial offender Crosbie has previous convictions for peering at women under leisure centre cubicles and was jailed for three years in 2009 after a court heard how he was found inside a house standing over a sleeping woman with her trousers down.

He was remanded in custody until his sentencing.

A spokesperson from the University of Leeds said: 'When this incident occurred, the athletes from the Olympic team were not booked in for a training session at the sports centre, so the highest level of security which is reserved for when athletes are training was not active. 

'Nonetheless, the intruder was detected, identified and subsequently arrested. 

'The sports centre is used by staff, students and members of the public, and fortunately this type of event is very rare.  

'However, we will of course be reviewing our security to see whether there is anything else we need to do to protect our users.'
