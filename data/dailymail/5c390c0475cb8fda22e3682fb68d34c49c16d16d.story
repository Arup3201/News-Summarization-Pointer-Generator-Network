Two high school runners were praised today after their quick-thinking heroics saved a baby from danger.

Rafaella Gibbons and teammate Maddison Larabee were completing a four-mile run in Winter Park, Florida on Monday evening when they spotted a toddler in the middle of a busy road. 

The two girls, who attend Winter Park High School, didn't hesitate and ran into the middle of the road to rescue the little boy.

Miss Gibbons, a freshman, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'Fortunately, there was a break in traffic. I was surprised at first. 

'I thought his mother was right behind him, but she wasn't. I ran out there as fast as I could to get the boy.'

Miss Larabee, a sophomore, was close behind her friend, throwing her arms up in the air to halt traffic. 

The girls then went to nearby houses until they found the boy's mother and returned the toddler to the distraught woman who hugged the girls in relief, the Sentinel reported. 

The mother was unaware that the little boy had managed to get out of the house.  

Their coach Kristin McWilliams told the Sentinel that she was proud of the students for their bravery. 

The two girls are both cross-country runners who are regularly among the top ten at races in their district.
