North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un executed his uncle by having him stripped naked and eaten alive by starving dogs while he watched, a report claimed yesterday.

Jang Song-Thaek was said to have been thrown into a cage with his five closest aides, after which 120 hounds which had been starved for three days were released, eating the men until there was nothing left.

The horrifying details emerged in a report in Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper, which said the gruesome act was known as ‘quan jue’, or ‘execution by dogs’.

Brutal: Jang Song-Thaek, in blue suit and handcuffs being escorted in court on December 12, was executed by wild dogs, according to reports coming from China

In previous executions, political 
prisoners were killed by firing squads with machine guns, although one 
aide was tied to a post and a mortar round was fired at him.

The
 report said the ‘quan jue’ lasted an hour, and Kim was said to have 
watched the stomach-churning ‘show’ along with 300 senior officials.

Analysts
 said the tyrant had probably invited the officials to the death 
ceremony as a warning that they should not step out of line and remain 
faithful not only to him but also to the Stalinist regime.

Kim had 
described his 67-year-old uncle – who was married to his father’s sister
 – as a traitor, a womaniser and a ‘despicable human scum – worse than a
 dog’.

It was previously thought he had been executed by firing squad.

The
 Singapore paper was quoting China’s official newspaper, Wen Wei Po, 
which was published in Hong Kong on December 12, although details 
emerged only yesterday.

The
 savage death of Kim’s uncle sent shockwaves through the authoritarian 
state, showing no one was safe – even family members.

Kim’s 19-year-old 
nephew fled his university campus in Paris after the execution and has 
gone into hiding.

The 
tyrant’s ruthless streak was documented last year when it was claimed he
 had a former lover executed because she appeared in a porn film.

South
 Korean newspapers said singer Hyon Song-wol and 11 others were arrested
 in August for violating North Korea’s laws against pornography and were
 executed, possibly by firing squad, three days later.

The
 condemned, all members of the performing groups Unhasu Orchestra and 
Wangjaesan Light Music Band, were accused of making videos of 
themselves  having sex and selling the videos for distribution in China.
 Other band members as well as the families of the victims were made to 
watch the mass execution.

The
 Straits Times said the report of the ‘quan jue’ vividly depicted the 
brutality of the young North Korean leader and the fact that it appeared
 in a Beijing-controlled newspaper showed that China no longer cared 
about its relations with the Kim regime.

Two
 days after the initial newspaper report, The Global Times, which is 
associated with the People’s Daily, a Chinese Communist Party outlet, 
published an editorial saying that the abrupt political change in North 
Korea epitomised the backwardness of the country’s political system. And
 it warned its own government not to cosy up to North Korea any longer, 
claiming that the majority of the Chinese people were ‘disgusted’ with 
the Kim regime.

Writing in 
the Straits Times, analyst Ching Cheong said the story, along with the 
stern editorial, provided a measure of the extent of Beijing’s loathing.

‘In purging a top official
 known for his close ties with Beijing in such a brutal manner, 
Pyongyang (the North Korean capital) did not hide its antagonism towards
 China,’ he wrote.

Kim Jong-Un is no stranger to ordering brutal crackdowns on anyone even suspected of posing a political threat - no matter how close the relationship.

The dictator had his former lover singer Hyon Song-wol, pictured right, executed by machine gun amid claims that she had been appearing in pornographic videos.

Hyon was among a dozen singers, musicians and dancers from two pop groups who were machine-gunned to death on August 20, last year.

The savage death of Kim's uncle sent shock waves through the authoritarian state, showing no one was safe - even family members.

Kim's teenage nephew fled to a university campus in Paris after the execution of Jang Song-Thaek.

The 19-year-old's name was removed from the postbox at prestigious social science university Sciences-Po, which saw South Korean media report that he was hiding for fear of his safety.

Fears also mounted last month that Kim's wife Ri Sol-Ju had fallen out of favour with the tempestuous leader.

She had not been seen publicly for weeks and was not present in an official photograph, provoking speculation

But these were largely eased when a video was released showing her with Kim Jong-Un at a memorial service to mark the second anniversary of his father's death.
