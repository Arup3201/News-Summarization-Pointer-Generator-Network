UK spies foiled a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan while British troops were still in the country. 

Eavesdroppers at GCHQ exposed the plot by monitoring chatter between an insurgent and other militants.

The agency had mounted its biggest overseas deployment since the Second World War by running a string of listening posts across southern Afghanistan to protect British soldiers.

An earlier assault on Camp Bastion – in September 2012 – cost the lives of two US marines, saw five RAF personnel injured and ended with the destruction of fighter jets worth £130million.

It was only because of the ability of GCHQ analysts to access large amounts of data to search for previously unknown security threats that the plan was foiled.

Following Edward Snowden’s revelations about the surveillance capabilities of US and British intelligence agencies, privacy campaigners have called to curb these powers.

It is understood the rate of military operations led by intelligence gathered by GCHQ rose over the course of the conflict to more than half of all missions. 

Such intelligence proved vital after the first assault on Camp Bastion in Helmand province when insurgents breached security at the base in September 2012.

They killed two US Marines, injured five RAF personnel and destroyed fighter jets worth £130 million.

In the following months, officials from the intelligence agency in Britain identified an insurgent who, until then, had been unknown to them.

The man had been communicating with known militants. The discovery triggered further analysis and a Taliban network – at least ten strong – was uncovered.

Coverage on the target was immediately increased and a team of between 20 and 30 analysts in Britain, and two GCHQ officials based in Afghanistan, discovered the target was Camp Bastion.

They found the method of attack planned to be remarkably similar to the earlier attack, in which the Taliban broke through the base’s perimeter dressed in American army uniforms in the darkness.

Despite wearing training shoes instead of boots and having beards, the coalition forces on the base only realised they were insurgents when they opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades.

In the latest case, as the militants made their way to Camp Bastion, a military operation was authorised that ‘broke up’ the gang before they could kill British and American soldiers.

The operation took place in the Washir district in April last year and the Taliban forces were captured, according to the Ministry of Defence.

The intelligence operation to stop the attack relied on the ability of GCHQ to access ‘bulk data’ on the internet – a technique that had led to it being accused of conducing ‘mass surveillance’.

John Bassett, a former official at the agency, told the Times: ‘This sort of vital operational intelligence can only be achieved through accessing bulk data under the current strict legal environment.’

The access to the data gives GCHQ the ability to search out a needle in a haystack, the agency contends.

GCHQ officials played an increasingly important frontline role in Britain’s 13-year war in Afghanistan, earning some 156 campaign service medals.

Intelligence officers arrived in Afghanistan shortly after combat troops were sent to help topple the Taliban regime in late 2001.

By the peak of the campaign the Afghan mission had become the agency’s second largest task, after counter terrorism.

While the bulk of the work was undertaken remotely, the agency benefited from having a number of people on the ground.

At any one time it had around 30 staff in the country, backed by a team of around 90 back in the UK.

GCHQ operated 10 secret posts inside often remote British military bases across Helmand and the south.

Its operations climaxed over the course of 2014, monitoring Taliban communications to thwart plans to hit vulnerable British convoys as they withdrew from bases across Helmand.

The agency has flown out more than 400 tons of monitoring and technical equipment as part of the withdrawal.

The equipment, equivalent to 100 shipping containers worth, was six times more kit than the agency deployed during Britain’s post-2003 Iraq campaign.

At the height of the campaign, when British troops were being killed and mutilated by homemade bombs, GCHQ waged its own battle trying to identify and target commanders smuggling bomb-making equipment into the country from Pakistan.

Analysts identified and stopped one commander ferrying more than 15 tonnes of precursor explosives across the border.
