Police are hunting for a man who risked his life by jumping onto railway tracks to save his football.   

British Transport Police have released images of the ‘stupid’ stunt, in a bid to identify the man who walked across tracks at Pallion Metro station in Sunderland.

The man was caught on CCTV cameras playing with the football before it rolled onto the tracks.

He then jumped down from the platform to retrieve it at about 5pm on November 11.

Officers have released the images in an appeal to find the man and warned he not only put himself in danger but risked the lives of others.

PC Graham Marshall, of British Transport Police, said: 'Despite ongoing warnings and attempts to highlight the dangers through issuing footage and images such as this, we are still continually seeing people who are still putting themselves at risk.

'In this case the man risks his life to retrieve a football. It’s crazy. We have undertaken extensive enquiries to trace this man to speak to him about this dangerous behaviour.

'The railway is an inherently dangerous environment, with regular trains running on the tracks and electric currents.

'This man was extremely lucky that a train was not passing through Pallion station at the time of the incident or the consequences could have been unthinkable.'

'Stupid': Police have blasted the actions of the man, who put himself in danger and risked the lives of others

PC Marshall urged Metro passengers 
should they drop items on to the tracks not to try and get them back 
themselves and risk getting an electric shock.

He added: 'We regularly see people dropping things on to the tracks at stations and climbing down to retrieve them.

'I hope this warning makes people think twice about risking your life in this way for the sake of replaceable belongings.'

A spokesman for Metro operator Nexus added: 'We urge the public not to trespass on railway lines. It is an incredibly stupid and dangerous thing to do.

'This latest incident, which was captured on CCTV, must serve as a warning that straying on to the tracks will not be tolerated and the police will take action against trespassers.

'There are many hidden dangers on railway lines. Offenders risk being hit by a train or being electrocuted as the equipment is run using high voltage power.

'It’s not worth the risk. Our message is clear, stay safe, stay off the tracks.'
