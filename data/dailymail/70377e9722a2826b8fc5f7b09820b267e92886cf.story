Everything she touches turns to gold and her outings this week were no different.

The style icon and much-emulated Duchess of Cambridge caused a website to crash after she was photographed wearing a Madderson London Naomi frock while on a royal visit.

The pregnant royal, who was on a visit to a primary school in the Notting Hill area of the capital on Thursday, sparked an online sell-out after customers rushed to the brand's website to buy the outfit.

The Duchess of Cambridge caused a flurry of sales for the Madderson London dress she wore on Thursday, left, and the website still isn't running because of demand. Today, she caused a £50 Hobbs dress to sell out on the high street store's website

Another day, another ultra stylish look from the Duchess of Cambridge.

While yesterday Kate wore a dress by upscale maternity label Madderson London, this time she opted for one of her favourite high street labels. This chic shirt dress is from Hobbs and we love the slinky silk jacquard material that gives it a luxurious irridesence.

And if you look closely you'll see it's embossed with an animal print making Kate, as ever, on trend. The matching belt, tied in a cute bow, is perfect for accentuating the waistline while the collar and cuffs ensure it's a smart choice for day.

It's frankly amazing that the Duchess is still able to fit into regular high street clothes but for this we're grateful. It means we can all steal her style whether we're expecting or not. And for those who love to model themselves on the lovely Kate, the good news is that this dress is in the sale so grab yourself a Royal bargain by clicking the link (right).

It also comes in grey so if you miss out on the brown version then all is not lost. Or recreate her look with our edit below. We've found lovely shirt dresses at Asos and Topshop. Style with opaque tights and simple black courts to complete the look.

Posting an image on Facebook of the Duchess wearing the dress, the label said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge looks beautiful wearing our Naomi dress today at a visit to a London primary school!'.

However, the message of delight was shortly followed by a statement which explained huge demand to purchase the outfit had caused the website to stop working.

They wrote: 'Apologies but our website is currently down due to exceptionally high traffic volumes. We're working to resolve this as soon as possible! We'll advise once we're back up...'

The loose-fitting navy dress featured cropped sleeves and embroidered trim, with the 33-year-old royal matching the frock with four-inch pumps and dark tights.

The £450 dress worn by the pregnant Royal immediately sold out and caused the website to crash

The website of the luxury British label - launched in 2012 - has since been fixed, but they revealed on their Facebook page the dress has now sold out and they have no plans to create any more this season

High street store Hobbs, which the Duchess has been pictured wearing today, saw their dress sell out online

The website of the luxury British label - launched in 2012 - has since been fixed, but they revealed the dress has now sold out and they have no plans to create any more this season.

They wrote: 'Our website is back online! However the ‪#‎naomidress has sold out following overwhelming demand... (sic).'

In a further post, they added: 'the ‪#‎naomidress has now sold out and we won't be making any more this season (sic).'

High street store Hobbs, which the Duchess has been pictured wearing today, saw a similar response.

The chic £50 shirt dress, which Kate wore while visiting foster carers in North London this morning, has already sold out online.

Kate accessorised with jewellery brand Mirabelle's Gina earrings that are priced at £30.

The Duchess of Cambridge attended an event hosted by The Fostering Network to celebrate the work of foster carers in providing support to vulnerable young people wearing the brown shirt dress
