Sensible: One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson said all Labour party members should support an EU referendum

One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson today led calls for Labour leader Ed Miliband to offer an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.

The Victor Meldrew star insisted to any ‘sensible’ party member would back the idea – which Mr Miliband has ruled out.

The leadership is warned it risks looking ‘undemocratic’ and ready to ‘ignore’ core supporters by a new campaign called Labour for a Referendum.

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with Brussels before staging an in-out vote by the end of 2017.

But Mr Miliband has repeatedly rejected the idea, warning years of uncertainty over Britain’s place in Europe risks deterring investors and damaging the economy.

The Labour for a referendum is being spear-headed by leading party donor John Mills, who warned Mr Miliband’s refusal to support a referendum is ‘unwise’.

More than 150 Labour councillors and MPs have backed the campaign, arguing it is vital to Mr Miliband’s hopes of becoming Prime Minister in 2015.

TV star Mr Wilson, a long-standing Labour supporter, said: ‘Any sensible Labour Party member should support Labour for a Referendum, as a pro-European I want to put the issue to bed once and for all.’

Today Mr Mills – who last week said Labour was policy-light - said he would vote to leave the EU in the present circumstances.

But
he backed Prime Minister David Cameron's plan for a renegotiation of 
the UK's relationship with Brussels followed by a referendum before then
end of 2017, saying it was "not an unreasonable stance at all".

The
millionaire, who has given Labour £1.65 million in shares this year, 
told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I think the Labour Party would be 
unwise to rule out having a referendum before the run-up to the next 
general election. A lot can happen over the next two years.’

He
added that he wanted a vote ‘the sooner the better’ because 
‘uncertainty about whether Britain is going to stay in the EU or not is 
bad for business and bad generally’.

Mr Mills also raised concerns about Labour's economic policies, claiming none of the three main parties offered a clear solution to the UK's current problems.

He said: ‘There is a general problem in this country, which is that none of the parties I believe - the Conservative Party or the Lib Dems or the Labour Party - have got a very clear idea about how to get the economy to grow more robustly or to get unemployment down.

‘I think that in the speech that Ed Balls made yesterday a number of proposals which are positive were produced.

‘But I think that there is still a danger that we are going to finish up, if we are not very careful, with 10 years or so or perhaps longer, of austerity and no growth and this seems to me to be a very daunting prospect.’

But Mr Mills said he supported Mr Miliband 'very strongly' and would continue to back Labour.

The Labour for a Referendum group has the support of several senior MPs including former Europe minister Keith Vaz.

Graham Stringer, Blackley and Broughton, said: ‘2010 was a low point for Labour support, I remember the 1983 election, the last time we got so few votes, and before that it was 1918. We should not and cannot afford to ignore our core supporters.’

Jim Dowd, MP for Lewisham West and Penge,  said: ‘I have been a supporter of this cause for many years and firmly believe the Labour Party must commit to a referendum before the European elections next year.

‘As the Tories tear themselves apart over this issue, Labour for a Referendum provides the opportunity to unite the party on giving the people a say on our future in the EU.’

A Labour party source said: 'We don;t think it is right now to call for a referendum for five years hence. We think it exposes our economy to uncertainty.'
