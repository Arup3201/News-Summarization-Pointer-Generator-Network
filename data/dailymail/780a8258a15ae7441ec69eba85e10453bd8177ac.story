Bendigo West Liberal candidate Jack Lyons has resigned over offensive remarks posted to his Facebook page

A Victorian Liberal Party member has resigned from his seat in Bendigo West after racist and sexist comments posted on social media were brought to light.

The Facebook posts from 2009 and 2010 were posted on Jack Lyons' personal page and included 'jokes' about poverty in Africa, and referred to Bendigo's historic Golden Dragon museum as 'ching chong gardens'

The Herald Sun uncovered the offensive remarks on Monday and alerted the Victorian Liberal Party, who have now called an emergency meeting for Wednesday morning to discuss appropriate use of social media.

One of the lines penned by Mr Lyons suggested if Africans living in poverty 'have to walk 5 miles everyday for water ... why not build the f***ing huts closer to the f***ing water'.

Another is said to have referenced prolific viewing of pornography, and stated: 'You know you have a problem when every letter of the alphabet triggers a porn bonanza in your address bar...'

In a statement to the Bendigo Advertiser on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Lyons apologised for his comments saying he did not intend to upset anyone.

'They were jokes not intended to offend anyone, I'm deeply embarrassed and apologetic and I've obviously rattled someone's cage', he said.

Lyon's father Councillor Barry Lyons is the mayor of Greater Bendigo, and in a statement expressed his disappointment over his son's actions.

'As parents, my wife Betty and I are disappointed and devastated,' he said.

'Jack’s actions have cut his political career short. His comments and actions are not defendable.

'I’m sure no offence was intended or meant but Jack has recognised his mistakes and stepped down.'

Other comments posted by Lyons included 'gags' such as 'Hey does this rag smell of chloroform to you', and the former candidate had previously defended past statements saying he was just having a joke.

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine vowed to find a new candidate for Bendigo West, after Liberal Party Director Damien Mantach released a statement on Monday night announcing Mr Lyons' resignation.

In an interview with 3AW radio on Tuesday morning, Labour MP James Merlino called for the Premier to make amends with the population following the airing of Mr Lyons' inappropriate comments.

'Denis Napthine has to come out and apologise to the people of Bendigo that he ever preselected this joker to run for a seat', Mr Merlino said.

Mr Lyons is the second Victorian Liberal candidate to stand down in the past week.

On Friday Aaron Lane stepped out of the running for Western Victoria after homophobic comments on Twitter posted by the endorsed candidate were discovered.
