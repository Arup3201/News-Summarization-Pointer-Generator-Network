Lazy: John Fennell, 23, said he would prefer a year in jail to unpaid work after having to do 150 hours

A serial criminal shrugged as he was jailed for almost a year and told friends: 'It's better than unpaid work.'

John Fennell, 23, had been made to work 150 hours instead of going to prison in November after he stole jewellery from a dead woman's house in Hull.

Just six weeks later the painter and decorator was at it again - smashing a bottle into a nightclub door and picking a fight with a stranger - so a judge jailed him for almost a year.

But despite having spent Christmas Day in the cells away from his young son, his only reaction was to shrug.

He turned to friends in the public gallery at Hull Crown Court and said: 'It's better than unpaid work.'

It was the 21st conviction for Fennell, who is a familiar face in the city's courts and once admitted to being 'excited by crime'.

The court heard Fennell had broken into a house in Hessle, East Yorkshire, in August last year with accomplices James Shaw and Carl Legg.

The trio smashed the windows of the house, which had been empty since the death of its former owner, and stole jewellery including a silver necklace and watch and three gold earrings.

For the burglary Fennell was handed a suspended prison term of 11 months and three weeks in November, when a judge told him he would have to work for 150 hours without pay.

Six weeks later, on Christmas Eve, he was arrested for smashing a window of Hull's Diva's bar and being aggressive towards a man who was getting out of a taxi. 

Dale Brook, prosecuting, said: 'The security guard was asked to go inside because the defendant was becoming aggressive towards another male.

'He was removed and he had a bottle of Becks in his hand. He used the base of the bottle to smash glass in the door.

'The defendant stayed around the bar but then went down a passageway.

'He came out where a taxi was and he kicked the taxi door.

'The passenger got out and the defendant was heard asking him for a fight, so security intervened again.'

He was arrested a short time later after being spotted on CCTV.

John Thompson, defending, said Fennell had argued with the man in the club because he had thrown a drink over him.

'He reacted badly,' said Mr Thompson. 'It was an offence entirely different to the one he was given a suspended sentence for.

'He was living with his mother, having contact with his young son. Then on Christmas Eve, he was thrown into a cell, deprived of being with his son on Christmas Day.

'He wasn't released until Boxing Day.'

Fennell admitted breaching a suspended sentence order, criminal damage and using threatening, insulting or abusive words or behaviour.

He was jailed for 40 weeks for the suspended sentence breach and a month consecutively for each of the other two offences, making approximately 11 months' jail in total.

Judge Michael Mettyear told him: 'You were given a golden opportunity and given a suspended sentence. Unfortunately, you haven't been able to take advantage of the chance given to you.

'You seem out of control at the moment, committing all sorts of offences as the mood takes you.'
