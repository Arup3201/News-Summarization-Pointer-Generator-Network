Barcelona's players feature in a dramatic new advert where they each receive special edition luxury watches after a race against time from the makers to hand them out to Luis Enrique's team.

Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar arrive alongside the rest of the Barca side to accept the watches but with four minutes to go until they are presented, they are nowhere to be seen.

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, the makers realise the squad are about to go without their timepieces and orders a glamorous assistant to rush them over to Barcelona.
