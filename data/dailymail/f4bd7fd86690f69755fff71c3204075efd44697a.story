From rations to ready meals, Britain’s kitchen cupboards have held the secrets of how we eat over the decades.

And in just two and a half months last summer one family of five munched their way from the post-war era to modern times to reveal how dramatically things have changed.

The Robshaws found the 1950s wholegrain National Loaf particularly hard to stomach, and ten-year-old Fred was overjoyed when sweets came off the ration.

The Robshaw family took on a culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in each decade from the 1950s to the 1990s. Pictured (from left) Rosalind, mother Rochelle, Fred, father Brandon and Miranda 'in the 1950s'

Forty years later, the Robshaws found themselves eating in the Nineties, sampling such delights as homemade pasta. 'Within living memory, the way we eat has been utterly transformed,' remarked Mr Robshaw

The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today.

Back In Time For Dinner, which starts on BBC2 next Tuesday, follows the Robshaws – Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred – from the 1950s to the end of the millennium, with the final episode casting an eye towards the future of food.

In the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner, knowing his leftovers would be their supper.

The 1960s saw the birth of the sugary cereal, while motorway service stations became almost fashionable as places to eat.

Vesta convenience meals were available and the more adventurous home cooks could buy exotic foreign ingredients such as garlic and olive oil – from the chemist.

In the 1970s, working women were learning to balance their careers with cooking for the family. The decade also saw the rise of the Pot Noodle.

In the 1980s goats cheese, mange tout and kiwi fruit became the foods to impress your dinner party guests. Gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades.

By the 1990s, sushi and curry were as popular as traditional English dishes and ready meals became the norm. 

The programme also shows how fridges, freezers, microwaves and even televisions revolutionised the way the country ate, and how the rise of supermarkets changed shopping forever. 

The Robshaws found that food in the 1970s was brightly-coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than before

Mr Robshaw, a freelance journalist and children’s writer, said 1950s-style rationing left them feeling hungry all the time and was particularly hard on Fred, who ‘literally danced with joy the day sweets came off the ration’.

He went on: ‘None of us found the National Loaf easy to digest. As flour was scarce, it was padded out with potato starch.’ 

When the family entered the 1960s, Mr Robshaw said ‘food became fun’ thanks to the likes of fish fingers and ‘it all felt extraordinarily liberating after the austerity of the 1950s’. 

He added: ‘It [the show] brought home to us all how British food has been revolutionised in an incredibly short time.’

Throughout the series, in which the family saw not only their menus given an overhaul but also their wardrobes, kitchen and daily routine, they were helped by famous faces including Mary Berry and Hairy Biker Dave Myers.
