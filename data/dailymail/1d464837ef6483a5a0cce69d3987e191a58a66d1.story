Patients using Google to look up a hospital being investigated for high death rates were given a nasty surprise when searches returned a picture of the Grim Reaper outside the building.

Google has now stepped in to take down the image - which was revealed to anyone typing the name of Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, into the search engine.

The haunting picture of the personification of death had been created and uploaded to a blog carrying critical articles about survival rates at the hospital, which serves a population of 250,000.

It then managed to rise to the top of Google’s ranking system for searches for the hospital - which is based on web traffic and the keywords used in image captions.

A Google spokesman admitted the image, which was automatically-generated when searching for the hospital, had been ‘inappropriate’ and confirmed it had now been removed from its image database.

She said: ‘The images you see in our information panel come from the web and are the same as the images you see in search results.

‘In this particular case, we have now updated the panel with a more appropriate image. All of our panels include a link so you can tell us when we may have an inaccuracy in our information.’

Death rates: Between October 2011 and September 2012, 18 per cent more patients at Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, died than would be expected at a similar hospital

Last month a two-day review of death rates at the hospital was carried out as part of the Keogh Review - which is looking at potential failings at 14 hospital trusts.

Between October 2011 and September 2012, 18 per cent more patients at Tameside died than would be expected at a similar hospital. The investigation was launched following the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, where hundreds of patients died needlessly due to poor care.

The results of the inspections, lead by government health chief Sir Bruce Keogh, will be made public later this year - although hospital managers will be told immediately of anything of serious concern.

A spokesman for Tameside General Hospital declined to comment.
