If you constantly hit the snooze button each morning to avoid getting out of bed, a new app might make waking for work a lot easier - or at least more interesting.

Instead of playing a generic tune or ringtone, the free Wakie app lets random members call each other at set times.

The app has members from around the world, and each call only lasts a minute - to make sure there are no 'awkward conversations or goodbyes'. 

Wakie (pictured) was created Armenian developer Hrachik Adjamian. To use Wakie, an alarm is set via the app for 7am for example, and at 7am, the user who set the alarm will receive a phone call from another member. This member can be from anywhere in the world

Wakie was created Armenian developer Hrachik Adjamian. 

To use Wakie, an alarm is set via the app for 7am for example, and at 7am, the user who set the alarm will receive a phone call from another member. 

This member can be from anywhere in the world.

Each call lasts just 60 seconds, and users will hear a warning at 50 seconds, before the call is automatically cut off. 

User can also choose to wake someone else up,and the free app does not reveal phone numbers.

Each call is carried out over the internet, which means if a user is connected to Wi-Fi or a mobile network, they won’t be charged for the call.

However, on a mobile network, the call will use data, and if the user has used more than their data limit, they may incur a fee.

It was created by Armenian developer Hrachik Adjamian who states on the app's website: 'Wakie is a fun, friendly community of people.

'It’s a brand new way to wake up, made especially for those of us who hate the jarring noise of an alarm clock.

‘When you use Wakie, you get to start your day with a smile instead of a frown!’

Wakie is available on Android and Windows Phone, and is due to launch in the iOS soon.

Currently, only users in the US, UK, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong can make calls and set alarms.

Other countries can make calls, but the alarm function has been enabled yet.

To use Wakie, set an alarm via the app, rather than the phone or tablet’s built-in clock, for 7am for example.

At 7am, the user who set the alarm will receive a phone call from another Wakie member, from anyone in the world.

Each call lasts just 60 seconds, and users will hear a warning at 50 seconds, before the call is automatically cut off.

The app states this means there are ‘no awkward goodbyes, no long conversations [and] calls are quick and casual.’

User can also choose to wake someone else up, and the free app does not reveal phone numbers.

Each call is carried out over the internet, which means if a user is connected to Wi-Fi or a mobile network, they won’t be charged for the call.

However, on a mobile network, the call will use data, and if the user has used more than their data limit, they may incur a fee.

Incoming calls are free for the clients of the majority of operators.
