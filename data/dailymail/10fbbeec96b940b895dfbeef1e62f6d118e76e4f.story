With her painstakingly-applied make up and fashionable clothes, Seanie Nammock is like any other teenager.

But behind her stylish looks, the teenager is battling a devastating genetic condition that is slowly paralysing her.

The 17-year-old, from West London, is suffering from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disorder that is turning her muscle and tendon into bone.

Seanie Nammock, 17, has a debilitating genetic condition that causes her to grow a 'second skeleton'

Already, her arms have become locked into a bent position at her waist, rendering them immobile like a statue.

The teenager has grown extra bone over her shoulders so she can no longer reach above her waist and struggles to brush or wash her own hair or dress without assistance - and the condition could get even worse.

The slightest knock or bump causes painful flare-ups that trigger the irreversible bone growth which locks her joints into place, and she cannot have any injections or biopsies as this too may cause unwanted bone to form.

Perversely, the condition makes it harder for her to avoid accidents as she finds it hard to steady herself on banisters when climbing the stairs and her locked arms affect her balance.

She can't even out out her hands to break her fall, a situation she describes as 'scary'.

But the debilitating condition has not hampered her hobbies or social life. A keen cook, she loves to shop and spend time with her friends.

'My friends are brilliant, they do my hair for me sometimes and help me get my coat on and anything I can't do really,' she said.

Seanie uses barbecue tongs to apply make up and a comb with an extended handle to do her hair.

The teenager, who passed 10 GCSEs, including five A grades, told the Sunday People: 'I just crack on with things to be honest. There is no other option.

'It's taken me the last five years to get to the point where I'm able to push it to the back of my mind and just carry on.'

The condition is particularly frustrating for Seanie because before she was diagnosed she was a keen sports fan, playing tag rugby and frequently visiting the gym.

Maria Granaghan, Seanie's mother said: 'Her friends are all great. They all look out for each other and just get on with being girls and enjoying themselves.'

Seanie was diagnosed with FOP in 2008 after she was admitted to hospital following a minor trampoline accident.

'She had fallen on her back and it had caused a sore lump to form,' said Miss Granaghan.

'It was huge, hard red and hot to the touch, so I took her to the hospital to get it checked out.'

Unfamiliar with the symptoms, doctors at St Mary's Hospital told her not to worry, and sent her home - but when the lump didn't clear and Seanie began complaining of severe pain, her mother rushed her to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

MRI scans and further testing revealed the diagnosis. 'It was a horrible shock,' said Mrs Granaghan, speaking in 2009.

She added that she is always on the lookout when she's out with Seanie, living in fear that a skateboarder or someone on a scooter will crash into her.

There is no cure for FOP and only about 600 people in the world have been diagnosed with it. Seanie is forced to rely on over-the-counter pain killers to combat the condition.

Like many other girls her age, Seanie is into make up and fashion. She has adopted more sedate pursuits because of her FOP, but used to be a keen sportswoman

Even a simple injection at the dentist is off-limits, so the teenager has to take good care of her teeth.

The family is trying to raise Â£120,000 for the FOP research team, which gets no funding from the government, and her sister Sinead is setting off on a charity trek up Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to raise cash later this week.

Seanie is furious that the battle to cure the condition gets so little support. She said: 'If you get me started on that I will really have a right old rant, especially when I hear about girls getting boob jobs on the NHS or politicians and their spending sprees.'
