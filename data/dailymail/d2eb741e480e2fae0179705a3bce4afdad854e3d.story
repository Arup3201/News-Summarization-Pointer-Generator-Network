A company chief has been criticised after he turned up to work in a new Â£178,000 Ferrari the day after the firm had announced 45 redundancies.

Trevor Modell, a consultant and former director at engine makers Lister Petter Ltd, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, drove to the factory in the Ferrari 458 Italia supercar as staff were still reeling from the cuts.

A spokesman for Unite, the union negotiating the employees' redundancy packages, said Mr Modell's behaviour was 'insensitive at best'.

The union had previously failed to improve working conditions at the site because the company had claimed it had little money.

He added that while job losses were expected at the site, the number of redundancies announced was a 'shock'.

The spokesman said: 'Lister Petter has been in a mess for a while.

'The union believes this has been a result of bad management over a period of time.'

Unite has said they had so far negotiated that around 20 of the jobs being lost would be through voluntary redundancies.

Those getting compulsory redundancies are expected to be told this Friday.

The firm, which employs 190 staff making diesel engines and has been in Dursley for almost 150 years, expects to finish its relocation to a facility in Hardwicke, near Gloucester, next year.

Asked how Mr Modell could afford such a luxury car at a time when the firm has to lay off workers, company director Pat Comer insisted that although once a director Mr Modell was now working as a consultant for the company.

Mr Comer also said delays in supplying critical components for its engines recently had impacted short term working, but denied that this had contributed to the job losses.

He said: 'The redundancies are as previously advised part of our restructure to ensure that we are best placed to remain competitive and serve our developing markets.

'The company remains committed to its facility that is in the process of being constructed at Hardwicke and should be available for us to start occupation in the second quarter of 2014.'

Mr Modell was unavailable for comment when MailOnline contacted the company.
