The 'threatening' emails sent by David Petraeus' mistress to a Florida socialite - that eventually uncovered the affair - vowed to make her perceived rival 'go away', it has been claimed.

The messages sent to Jill Kelley, who contacted the FBI after receiving them in May, were so menacing that the military party planner feared for her life, according to a friend.

The friend, who has not been identified, said that Kelley, a military party planner in Tampa, had called her to seek advice after receiving the messages and read them out over the phone.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, she described the messages as much more threatening than originally reported, adding: 'Any normal person who got emails like that would have immediately called police.'

'Threats': David Petraeus' former mistress Paula Broadwell, pictured left on Tuesday morning, reportedly sent emails that were so menacing to Jill Kelley, right, that she saw them as death threats

In the messages, which were sent anonymously, Broadwell promised to 'make you go away' and boasted about her military background and having 'powerful' friends, the Daily News reported.

'This wasn’t just a case of cyber-bullying,' the friend said. '(Kelley) was scared for her life. She had reason to be. These emails are the real thing. When she read them to me, I literally had the shivers.'

The Wall Street Journal previously reported that, in one email, Broadwell had accused Kelley of touching 'him' underneath a table 
and asked if Kelley's husband was aware of her actions.

In another, Broadwell asked: 'Who do you think you are?'

She also accused the socialite, a 
Petraeus family friend, of 'parad[ing] around the base', adding: 'You 
need to take it down a notch.'

But the threatening emails, which had 
previously been described as 'cat-fight stuff', led to Broadwell's 
undoing after Kelley contacted a friend in the FBI about the messages.

The anonymous emails contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts and, thinking there had been a potential national security breach, the FBI was forced to investigate.

During their probe, they traced the emails back to Broadwell and also uncovered emails revealing her months-long affair with CIA boss David Petraeus, whose biography she had penned.

But investigators also found tens of thousands of emails between Kelley and Gen. John Allen, head of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and deemed some 'inappropriate' and 'flirtatious'.

school run with her two young sons on Tuesday morning, has told friends 
she is sorry for the hurt her affair with the former CIA boss has caused
 her family

The married father of two is now under investigation, but both he and Kelley deny any wrongdoing.

Kelley has also denied being any more than
 friends with Petraeus and released a statement saying: 'We and our 
family have been friends with Gen. Petraeus for over five years. We respect his family’s privacy and want the same for us and our three children.'

Her
 sister, Natalie Khawam, has also been dragged into the scandal, with 
reports detailing her troubled child custody battles and shrewd 
socialising skills. Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred is now representing
 her.

The latest 
revelations about the contents of the emails - which eventually led to 
Petraeus' resignation from the CIA on November 9 - come as Broadwell 
moved back home with her husband and children.

She arrived back in Charlotte, North 
Carolina on Sunday after hiding out at her brother's Washington D.C. 
home for a week after the scandal broke.

Her brother, Stephen Kranz, revealed 
that Broadwell is 'incredible sorry' for hurting her family and 
acknowledged that she made a mistake.

'She's been devastated by this,' Kranz told People Magazine.

'She
 is filled with guilt and shame for what she's done and she's incredibly
 sorry for the pain she's caused her husband, her family, Petraseus's 
family. She accepts responsibility for her actions and knows she made a 
mistake.'

He added that she is now committed to repairing the damage to her family and protecting her children from the furore following the affair and Petraeus' resignation.

On Monday, she was pictured on the 
school run and carrying out errands, while her husband Scott was 
photographed embracing a friend in the doorway of their home.

As the family returned home on Sunday, they were welcomed by a group of
 friends and neighbours, and a close friend - who did not want 
to be named - said Broadwell was overwhelmed by the support.

Mrs Broadwell maintained her stony 
silence after being confronted by a number of reporters when she pulled 
up in an SUV, according to WSOC-TV.

Her
 husband Scott refused to comment, but appeared happy to joke about the 
media circus which has surrounded his family since the affair emerged.

Scott was asked: 'Is there anything at all you'd like to say, Scott? Now's your chance, this is it.'

But after pausing for a moment, he simply replied: 'No comment at this time.'

He later returned to the driveway to 
take groceries out of the car and joked with reporters, saying: 'I'll be
 out here Tuesday taking out trash, if you want to shoot that.'

Family: Scott and Paula Broadwell took their two sons into their home after more than a week in hiding

The doctor revealed that the family would be releasing a statement soon, but did not elaborate on when it would be.

The couple were seen in public for 
the first time on Saturday night returning to her brother's $2.3million 
home after apparently going out for dinner in the Washington area.

Looking stern and taking the lead 
from her husband, Mrs Broadwell did not speak to the gathered news 
reporters as she marched into her sibling's home.

It
 was the first time that Paula had been seen since Tuesday evening, when
 she was photographed wearing a hot pink top in the kitchen of her 
brother's home.

She had been holed up there since 
returning from what was supposed to be a romantic get-away with Scott to
 celebrate her 40th birthday - which was curtailed when news of the 
Petraeus affair broke.

Friends and family of the pair told 
reporters in the wake of the affair revelations that the Broadwells had
 built a happy home in Charlotte, where they live with 
their two sons, Lucien 6, and Landon, 4.

The radiologist works at a hospital 
in the southern city and the 43-year-old and his wife  'love 
to do Crossfit, run, ski and surf together.' according to a biography of Paula Broadwell published by the University of Denver.

In
 January, while promoting her biography of Petraeus, Mrs Broadwell told the Charlotte Observer that she met Scott in 
Germany and described them both as 'adventure junkies.'

At
 an alumni event for the University of Denver in October, Broadwell said
 it was 'very difficult to start a family' when the two of them were on 
active duty.

'We had decided before we got married
 that every other move would be the other person’s choice, since we are 
both very career-oriented,' said Paula Broadwell at the event. according
 to the Daily Beast

They
 moved into their $800,000 two-story brick home in Charlotte's Dilworth 
suburb in 2009 and Scott became an employee of Charlotte Radiology at 
the same time.

In the 
January interview with the Charlotte Observer Broadwell said that when 
she was abroad with Petraeus in Afghanistan, Scott and her mother took 
care of their two sons.

Scott Broadwell and his wife have also been involved in a number of groups that work to benefit veterans of the armed forces.

Since the affair broke, their home 
has been empty and visible on the driveway is power-washed writing, 
which reads in a flourishing font: ‘Dad loves Mom.’

The bombshell of the illict 
affair that rocked the nation broke when Broadwell and her husband were enjoying a two-day break at the Middleton Inn in Little 
Washington, Virginia.

Sources told the Washingtonian.com 
that the couple had enjoyed 'strenuous' bike rides, champagne and cozy 
dinners since arriving at the luxury inn last Thursday evening - the day
 before the scandal hit the news.

The
 couple reportedly joined other guests at the Inn for breakfast - but by
 the time they returned from a romantic dinner last Friday evening, they
 were described to the magazine as 'not being in very good moods'.

They
 left abruptly last Saturday morning and were allegedly on their way to 
DC. A party had also been planned for Mrs Broadwell's birthday on 
Saturday night - but it was cancelled.
