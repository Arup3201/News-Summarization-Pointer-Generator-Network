He was often pictured by his side as he roamed the grounds of the White House.

So it comes as no surprise, despite his passing away six months ago, that George W Bush still has not forgotten his beloved pet dog Barney.

The former American President posted a tribute to the Scottish Terrier on his Facebook page on what would have been Barney's 13th birthday.

Tribute: Former President Bush, pictured struggling to get his dog Barney to walk up the steps to Air Force One in 2002, described the dog as a 'great pal'

He wrote: 'Today would have been the lad's 13th birthday. Here's to Barney, a great pal' next to a picture of the pair.

Barney was inseparable from the president and his wife, Laura, before he died from lymphoma at 12-and-a-half years old in February.

At the time of his death, Bush said: 'He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal.'

During his eight-year tenure in the White House by his master's side, the well-groomed, coal-black pooch starred in ‘BarneyCam’ short films produced by the staff, gave tours of the presidential residence and greeted heads of state.

'He was always polite and never jumped in their laps,' Bush wrote of the four-legged host.

Old friends: President Bush announced in February that Barney died at the age of 12 after suffering from lymphoma

Four-legged star: Barney was a celebrity in his 
own right, starring in BarneyCam short films produced for the holidays, 
greeting heads of state and having a page dedicated to him on the White 
House website 

Loyal friend: Bush wrote in his eulogy for Barney that the little terrier would guard an entrance to the White House as if he were a Secret Service agent

The pooch, however, was less kind to the press. The little terrier made headlines when in 2008 he bit the finger of Reuters reporter Jon Decker who got too close.

The feisty pet also took a bite out of Boston Celtics public relations director Heather Walker in 2009.

Barney had seen his fair share of criticism. Republican strategist Karl Rove jokingly dubbed him a ‘lump’, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said a world leader should own big, not small dogs, Today.com reported.

As well as his stays at the White House, Barney also used to accompany Mr Bush when he fished for bass at the family ranch in Crawford, Texas, and was said to have been a ‘fierce armadillo hunter.’

On trips to Camp David, the former president said Barney’s favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green.'

According to his official biography on President Bush's White House site, Barney was born September 30, 2000, in New Jersey.

His mother was a Scottish Terrier named Coors who was owned by former Environmental Protection Agency Director Christine Todd Whitman.

According to Politico, Barney is survived by the Bush clan's other Scottish Terrier, Miss Beazley and a cat named Bob.

Mr Bush is far from the first American President to have a dog by his side while in the White House.

His father, George H. W. Bush, was so attached to his springer spaniel Millie that he had his White House carpenters build a custom birthing box when she became pregnant.

George Washington had his pack of hunting hounds, while Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Scottish terrier Fala, once dubbed Big Boy, would often attend galas with him.

loved the outdoors, and the pooch would often accompany him on fishing 
trips and long walks on his Texas ranch

President Calvin Coolidge was also a well-known animal lover. He had in his menagerie six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, a wallaby and a raccoon named Rebecca who walked on a leash.

His most famous pet, however, was a pygmy hippo, given to him as a gift by tire mogul Harvey Firestone.

Other unusual presidential pets include John Q. Adams' alligator, who he kept in the in a bathroom of the East Room, Woodrow Wilson's pet ram, who enjoyed chewing tobacco, and Lyndon B. Johnson's three-legged dog named Loki.

Of course, the most recent addition to this long list of presidential companions is President Obama’s Portuguese water dog Bo.
