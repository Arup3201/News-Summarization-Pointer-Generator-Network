Sickness fear: Frances Osborne believes British people need to learn to stay at home when they're poorly

Frances Osborne has admitted to suffering from ‘germ stress’ when she encounters someone who is poorly.

The Chancellor’s wife confessed to feeling ‘paralyzed’ when confronted with people who are under the weather and that the British should learn to stay home when they are sick.

But the 44-year-old author also said there was an ‘art to socializing sick’, involving ‘medicines, makeup, and discreet coughs’.

She made the comments in an American magazine, and recalled attending a dinner where one of the guests had come despite feeling ill.

‘Next to me was a man who might have been charming had he been able to talk,’ she told Town and Country magazine.

‘As it was, he could barely croak between deep, chesty coughs. When he didn’t have a handkerchief to his nose, it was running a marathon.’

She admitted spending the entire evening fearful of catching the infection, saying ‘the last thing anybody at that benefit signed up for was exchanging a donation for a fever’.

She added: ‘And, because we were in England, he said, “Jolly poor show not to show up, don’t you think?”

‘I nodded and mumbled yes a couple of times in between his guttural noises. But what I wanted to say—what I wish I had been brave enough to say—was, “Go home now! No one wants your cold!”’

Mrs Osborne, who has written two biographies and a novel, admitted that cancelling last minute risks looking like a 'flake', and said she had attended events when she felt ‘at death’s door’.

‘The problem is that my phlegmy fellow diner had a point. From many a host’s perspective, only the most dire of circumstances excuse a late-stage cancellation,’ she said.

She revealed that she attended a 
sibling’s wedding recently despite feeling poorly and said it was 
example of a social occasion which requires ‘either attendance or an 
ambulance’.

But Mrs Osborne added that those who do decide to soldier on should keep a stiff upper lip.

‘The only thing worse than showing up sick to a social event is showing up sick and admitting it. However bad you feel, the onus is on you to hide your symptoms.

‘There is, I’ve come to learn, an art to socializing sick. It involves medicines, makeup, and discreet coughs into corners of rooms.

‘It requires massive amounts of antibacterial lotion, wide-berth air kisses, fibs, and whatever else it takes to alleviate fears of contagion. Most of all, it requires a brave face.’

Mrs Osborne’s latest novel, Park Lane, was published in June and tells the story of two women – one a housemaid, the other a debutante – in Edwardian London.

The Bolter, her biography of her great-grandmother Idina Sackville, was a number one bestseller in the UK.
