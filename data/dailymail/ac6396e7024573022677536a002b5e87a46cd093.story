Three teenagers accused of brutally raping and beating a 16-year-old girl so badly that she broke bones in her face and bled from her ear will be charged as adults.

The minors are part of a gang of two girls and three boys arrested following the incident at a house in Hollywood, Florida on November 1.

Police were able to identify all five of the teenagers allegedly involved because one of the accused took video of the fight and sexual assault on their cell phone.

Two of the teenagers - Erica Avery, 16, and Dwight Henry, 17, - made their first court appearances on Sunday, appearing via video feed from separate lock-ups. They helped to strip the victim and held her down while another member of the gang forced himself on their victim.

Both are expected to be back in court on Monday for a judge to approve the appointment of counsel.

Avery and Henry, along with Patricia Montes, 15, of Hollywood, were each charged with two counts of felony sexual battery and two counts of kidnapping.

They, along with adults Jayvon Woolfork, 19, and Lanel Singleton, 18, are accused of luring the 16-year-old girl to Woolfork's home where they beat her and forced her to have sex with Woolfork.

All five defendants must have their own lawyer and are understood to be seeking public defenders.

Reading through the charging documents on Saturday, Broward County Judge Joseph Murphy remarked, 'This is one of the most hideous crimes I've come across in a long time,' reports the Sun Sentinel.

The victim claims that she 
was kicked, thrown down stairs and had her face smashed on concrete, 
breaking bones near both her eyes.

Judge
Hurley said: 'This 16-year-old woman, both of her eyes were closed from
being beaten, she had blood coming from one of her ears.

'The court is concerned for the safety of this 16-year-old alleged victim.'

The girl was listening to music and watching TV when she was approached by the group who demanded she have sex with Woolfork or be beaten, according to the arrest reports.

When she refused, she was beaten and dragged to a bedroom, where all of the accused removed her clothes and held her down while Woolfork raped her, the report said.
