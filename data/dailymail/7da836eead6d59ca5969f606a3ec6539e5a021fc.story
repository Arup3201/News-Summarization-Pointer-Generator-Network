Luis Suarez faces an uncertain future at Barcelona following the dismissal of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and the resignation of his assistant Carles Puyol.

The Uruguay striker is coming under increasing scrutiny at the Nou Camp since his £75million move from Liverpool and is under pressure to rediscover his goal-scoring form.

Despite just three goals in 12 games since his move from Anfield in the summer, his situation at Barcelona will be monitored by the top clubs in the Barclays Premier League.

Arsenal previously tried to sign him but Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea will continue to monitor the forward’s progress over the next five months.

Barcelona have been decisive in the past with top players and sent Zlatan Ibrahimovic on loan to AC Milan when he failed to settle into Pep Guardiola’s side after his £50m move from Inter.

Although Barcelona have no intention of selling Suarez yet, he could be the fall guy in the summer under a new regime at the Nou Camp.

Club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed that he was calling the presidential elections early as the team prepare for this evening’s Copa del Rey clash with Elche in the Nou Camp.

Suarez’s position is further complicated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision to uphold FIFA’s one-year transfer ban for illegal approaches to under-age players, which means they cannot replace him yet. The Uruguay forward, who completed a four-month ban for biting in October, was brought in during the summer on Zubizarreta’s watch.

Suarez was desperate to join Barcelona and got his wish when Liverpool accepted a £75m bid for him. Coach Luis Enrique, battling to save his job at the club after falling out with Lionel Messi, has played Suarez in various roles up front. He started last Sunday’s clash with Real Sociedad but the striker was unable to prevent them losing for the third time this season in La Liga.

He has scored just once in the league — the 5-0 victory over Cordoba on December 20 — and has scored twice in Champions League victories over Apoel Nicosia and PSG.

Puyol announced he had terminated his working contract at the club in the wake of Zubizarreta’s sacking on Monday and Luis Enrique’s future was due to be discussed at an emergency board meeting.
