Casey Anthony's parents are holed up at their Orlando home after receiving death threats following their daughter's stunning acquittal, which has sparked outrage across the U.S.

Cindy and George Anthony said they were shocked by the 'not guilty' verdict, which means the 25-year-old defendant is poised to walk free tomorrow morning.

The family, which has been torn apart by accusations of incest, rape and adultery, said it was 'too early' to know if they will welcome back their daughter.

Stonefaced: Cindy and George Anthony were the first to leave the courtroom, with their attorney Mark Lippman, after their daughter was found not guilty of murder

Speaking yesterday, their lawyer Mark Lippman said that there were threats against the couple and that police were investigating.

'Obviously there's some concern but the Orange County Sheriff's Office is doing their job and they're being protected,' he said.

After the verdict was read in court, George and Cindy were the first people to leave the courthouse, walking out in silence.

They appeared to have no reaction as the stunning verdict was announced.

'I think they were shocked that it [the verdict] came back not guilty, but you can never tell what a jury is going to do and they were not expecting anything,' Mr Lippman told Good Morning America.

'They were shocked that the jury didn't find any sort of evidence against her even though the state did a fantastic job.

The couple said that their reputations have been 'destroyed' by the claims of Casey's lawyers that George Anthony molested her as a child and that he helped hide the dead body of their two-year-old granddaughter.

'Hopefully they can start rebuilding their lives,' said Mr Lipmann. 'Their lives will never be the same. This case has destroyed everybody's reputations.

'Even if it is baseless, there's people out there that are going to believe no what I say or they say for the rest of their lives, they're going to believe what the defence told them.'

It is not clear where Anthony will go if she is freed after sentencing tomorrow morning.

Her parents, who have always been torn by their roles as both family members of the victim and the parents of the accused, said they have not yet spoken to their daughter, but plan to do so 'at some point', according to their lawyer.

Casey's parents, who have been married for 30 years, publicly supported their daughter from her initial arrest in 2008, as they continued to lead the search for their missing granddaughter, to the start of the murder trial.

But on the shocking first day of the 
murder trial, Casey's lawyers accused George Anthony of sexually abusing
his daughter from the age of eight.

Defence
lawyer Jose Baez also suggested Mr Anthony had a role in disposing the 
body of little Caylee, a claim Mr Anthony also denies.

The
family, which has denied the defence's account of events that Caylee 
drowned in their pool, said it hoped to one day find out the 'truth' of 
what happened.

Their 
lawyer Mark Lipmann said: 'There was a slim chance that we were hoping 
to get some slither of truth during this trial and that would have been 
through testimony by Casey.'

He
added: 'Hopefully one day she'll tell her story, but who knows that to 
believe. Everybody wants the truth and who knows whether it will ever 
come.'

The defence 
accused Anthony's father George Anthony of sexually abusing her as a 
child, and suggested the dysfunctional relationship explained Casey's 
behaviour after her own daughter's death. Mr Baez acknowledged Anthony's
actions as 'bizarre' and 'inappropriate'.

Four days after the defence claim Caylee died, Anthony paraded in a 'hot body' contest at a nightclub and friends said she showed no signs of distress, anxiety or depression.

Mr Baez had told the court that Mr Anthony had a role in disposing of the body and bullied his daughter into keeping it all secret.

On the final day of the trial, Anthony reportedly mouthed either 'it's not his fault' or 'because it's his fault' while prosecutors said she was trying to pin the death on her father.

After jurors heard Anthony's mother Cindy may have left a ladder in the pool where the child allegedly drowned, prosecutors said: 'Casey Anthony would have you believe that this is all her mother's fault anyway for leaving the ladder down, let's twist the knife in my mum a little bit more.'

Casey reportedly mouthed: 'I never said anything like that, it wouldn't have been my mum.'
