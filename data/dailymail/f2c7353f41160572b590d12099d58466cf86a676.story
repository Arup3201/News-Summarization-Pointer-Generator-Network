Robin van Persie continued his fine form ahead of the World Cup by scoring the winner as Holland beat Ghana in their penultimate warm-up friendly in Rotterdam.

The Manchester United striker settled a contest that never truly ignited when he tapped in after five minutes following quick-thinking from Wesley Sneijder to square the ball with the goalkeeper closing in.

Louis van Gaal’s team dominated possession from start to finish and would have settled the contest long before half-time if Arjen Robben had not been wasteful in front of goal.

In the week Van Persie claimed he 
would ‘walk on fire’ for United’s next manager, his goalscoring record 
stood at five in 213 minutes for club and country - either side of his 
injury lay-off - when he found the net early on.

The Dutch 
captain was the spearhead of a flexible formation set up by Van Gaal 
that was ostensibly 5-3-2 but became 3-5-2 or 3-4-3 when wing-backs 
Daley Blind and Daryl Janmaat bombed forward.

If Van Gaal brings such a system to the Premier League next season, we’ll certainly be in for some fun and games.

It
 may have ensured Holland plenty of the ball but they couldn’t raise the
 game beyond a staccato rhythm and chances were frustratingly short in 
supply.

Robben was the worst culprit, sending the ball wide from
 all of three yards after Blind had sprinted to the byline and delivered
 the perfect cross on 11 minutes.

He was guilty of squandering 
another sitter when Janmaat set him clear with a low cross-field ball 
from the right, the Ghana goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey staying on his feet 
to block.

And on the stroke of half-time, Robben saw an angled 
drive palmed away by the keeper after one of his thigh-pumping runs had 
worked a shooting opportunity.

In the second-half, he curled a 
free-kick over the bar and forced Kwarasey into a block at his near post
 after stealing into the box as it turned into a one-man show.

Substitute
 Memphis Depay, who replaced Van Persie with 17 minutes remaining, fired
 wide in the last few minutes but a second wasn’t forthcoming.

Van
 Gaal had surprisingly culled his provisional squad of 29 to 23 on the 
morning of the match and he will need his chosen ones to find a bit more
 cutting edge when they line up against Spain, Chile and Australia in an
 awkward World Cup group.

Ghana, meanwhile, were desperately 
disappointing and failed to create a meaningful chance all night. This 
was as comfortable as one-nil wins come and they seriously need some 
impetus before tackling a World Cup group that contains Portugal and 
Germany.

Frustrated: Robben wasn't his usual self for the Netherlands but van Gaal's men won their penultimate friendly 

On his way: This will be Louis van Gaal's final tournament with Holland as he prepares to take the helm at Manchester United
