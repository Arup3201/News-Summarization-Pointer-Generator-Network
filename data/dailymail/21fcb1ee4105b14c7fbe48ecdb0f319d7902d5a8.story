A glimpse of what life was like for soldiers on the front line over the festive season has been revealed in a display of historic Christmas cards.

The iconic Regimental cards were sent home to the UK by soldiers and highlight the pride and humour of the First World War over the festive period.

The 100-year-old cards have gone on display today  at York Castle Museum as part of a Christmas display.

A card wishing 'Hearty greetings', from 1917, features a snowy view from  the prisoner of war camp and was sent as propaganda to the families of prisoners back home- the cards were produced because people running the camps wanted families in Britain to think the prisoners were being treated fairly and humanely

And the quintessentially British greeting cards include images such as a British bulldog, 'Somme pudding' and Father Christmas delivering alcohol.

And one of the cards, which was sent by a prisoner of war, even seems to try and portray a positive slant on spending Christmas captured behind enemy lines.

Another card shows a British soldier going over the top declares 'By Gum! Father Christmas!' with a large bearded man delivering bottles of alcohol.

While one features a soldier marching to Berlin with the caption: '21 Division, Born 1914, still going strong - Christmas 1917.'

Faye Prior, collections facilitator at York museums Trust, said: 'Regimental cards were not new to the First World War, but the growth of the regiments and the recruitment of Kitcheners' new armies meant the market for regimental cards grew exponentially. 

'These cards often portrayed the dark humour and 'stiff upper lip' attitude which were strongly associated with British trench warfare.

'Cards were also produced by German prisoner of war camps, to try to convince British families that imprisoned soldiers were being treated well.

They were professionally printed and would have been sold to soldiers all over the world with slogans such as 'Born 1914 and still going strong'

These historic Christmas cards show the humour and pride of the British troops despite the horrendous conditions many of them faced

'In both cases the cards portrayed images that each side wanted to be put into the public domain.'

The regimental cards were professionally printed and would have been sold to soldiers all over the world.

Some of those on show include a British Tommy and a French soldier holding a circular bomb in the snow with the caption 'Somme' Pudding.

There is also a British Bull Dog under the Union Jack with the caption 'And our Banner unfurled, Shall proclaim to the world, That there's life in the Old Dog yet.' 

The cards from the prisoner of war camp were produced by, or for, the camps, and were sent as propaganda to the families of prisoners back home.

The cards were produced because people running the camps wanted families in Britain to think the prisoners were being treated fairly and humanely.

This particular card shows a pleasant snowy scene as the 'View from the Camp.'

One of the quintessentially British images featured on the greeting cards was that of the British bulldog under the Union Jack with the caption 'And our Banner unfurled, Shall proclaim to the world, That there's life in the Old Dog yet'
