Man of the match Harry Kane hailed one of the 'greatest moments' in his fledgling Tottenham career after helping his side snatch a 2-1 comeback victory over 10-man Aston Villa with a late winner at Villa Park.

Villa's five-game and 15-minute wait for a goal ended when Andreas Weimann opened the scoring following a spell of dominance from the hosts as he collected Charles N'Zogbia's cross to slot home from close range.

Tempers flared for the second time in little over five minutes after the hour mark and Christian Benteke was shown a straight red card by referee Neil Swarbrick after a tussle with Erik Lamela in which the Belgium international raised his hand to his opponent's face.

Things started to go downhill for the hosts after that and Spurs found their equaliser with five minutes left as an unmarked Nacer Chadli fired home Lamela's corner, before substitute Kane's deflected last-gasp free-kick claimed all three points for the away side.

Kane told Sky Sports 1: 'Without a doubt it was one of the greatest moments for me in a Spurs shirt in my career so far. To be 1-0 down in an important game for us, we needed a win and to pull it back there at the end is a moment I won't forget.'

The 21-year-old striker, who was sent on by Mauricio Pochettino with just over 30 minutes left, added: 'The manager said there's plenty of time left, to be getting on the ball, you'll get some chances so take one and obviously fortunately I was able to do that and it's all smiles in the dressing room now.'

As for taking the 89th-minute free-kick, Kane said: 'He (Lamela) wanted it and he'd taken the one before , but I said 'this one can be mine' and obviously it ended up in the back of the net and it was great - a great result.'

Tottenham manager Pochettino believes Kane has certainly put his name forward to be included in the starting line-up for his side's next assignment away to Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League on Thursday. 

 'Yes it will be difficult because he score and gave us the victory and he gave a big impact for us. He deserves this reality,' said the Spurs boss.

'We select the team on analysis but since the beginning of the season he is getting better and improving and maybe he deserves to play in the next game, why not?'

Pochettino was thrilled with his team's second-half efforts and insisted that his troops were full value for their 2-1 victory.  

'The victory, I am happy for the players and the fans today. Today they were great and with the three points in a difficult stadium it is a good day,' he added. 

Nacer Chadli levelled matters in the 84th minute against 10-man Villa before Kane grabbed the winner late on 

'I think we started well. If you see the stats we have double chances and more. Aston Villa only shoot on target a few times but we shoot a lot. 

'We need to be strong because always it is negative on the team but after the game against Newcastle I said we deserve more, our performance did not reflect in the table, but we will practise our philosophy.

'I don't see the action. Maybe now after we analyse maybe. But this is football. In football sometimes this happens throughout the season but I think in the end if we had 11 or 10 we were better than Aston Villa.

'This is football. Sometimes you are lucky. For us these three points are important.
