It is an archaic tradition perceived by many to be outdated and elitist - with Prince Philip once deeming it 'bloody daft'.

But now the presentation of young debutantes to elite society bachelors has been resurrected in Dubai.

At a glitzy recreation of the British Queen Charlotte's Ball, girls of 'marrying age' showed off their poise, elegance and grace at The London Season Ball on Royal Island.

High society: The girls, who are all of 'marrying age', demonstrate their poise and elegance at the event

Accompanied by eligible male escorts, they wore their hair in elegant knots and donned white dresses as a sign of their innocence and purity.

They also put the etiquette skills they had been taught at The London Season Academy into practice.

The ball, featuring a charity auction and speeches, was held on the exclusive and privately-owned Royal Island, part of the World Islands development off the coast of Dubai, on Thursday.

It attracted about 150 well-heeled  and royal guests from Europe and the Middle East region, including X Factor finalist Jahmene Douglas.

Escorts: The girls were accompanied by male escorts - dubbed the 'debs delights' - including (l-r) Neil Matthias, 18, Matthew Philips, 17, Raunak Bhojwani, 18, Thomas Francis, 17, Jack Staply, 17 and Owen Westall also 17

Anticipation: Debutantes arrive on Royal Island ahead of the unusual event

Earlier in the day, the debutantes, aged
16 and 20, took part in a range of social, business and etiquette 
classes at The Emirates Towers.

They were taught how to cut a scone, prepare afternoon tea and shake hands correctly.

They
were also advised on codes of conduct by Her Royal Highness Princess 
Katarina of Yugoslavia, the Duchess of Somerset and Sir Tobias Clarke.

Impressive guest list: The ball attracted dozens of rich, famous and royal guests, including X Factor finalist Jahmene, pictured left with a debutante. Right, a man bids during the charity auction

The prestigious event was based on the historic Queen Charlotte's Ball, held annually at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

Up until 1958, young debutantes used 
to be presented to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, until Prince Philip 
pointed out that it was ‘bloody daft’.

The
event, introduced by King George III in 1780 as a way to celebrate his 
wife’s birthday, was seen as a rite of passage for upper-class girls.

Royal advice: Earlier in the day, the debutantes, aged 16 and 20, took part in a range of social, business and etiquette classes with Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia, left

Lecture: They were taught how to cut a scone, how to prepare afternoon tea and how to shake hands correctly

Parents hoped their daughters would meet a potential suitor - with organisers aiming to equip the young women with poise, confidence and social skills needed for their married lives.

However, as well as Prince Phillip's dismissal, the Queen felt such an elitist event was at odds with her desire for a more modern monarchy.

Her sister, Princess Margaret, was also 
apparently not a fan - reportedly saying: 'We had to put a stop to it - 
every tart in London was getting in.'

Arrival: Debutantes (l-r) Olivia Stead, Anna Zaphiriou-Zarifi, Nicole Gilmer, Eloise Knight and Isabella Robinson arrive at The Emirates Towers for their first class of etiquette, social and business protocol

Preparations: Debutantes Isabella Robinson, left, and Eloise Knight, both 17, wait to have their dresses fitted for the prestigious ball

Perfection: The debutantes take time out of the spotlight to check each others' dresses

On its website, the London Season Academy says it 'aims to carry on British traditions and promote etiquette'.

It adds: 'Etiquette in a multicultural society is important in helping to navigate social occasions and to avoid unintentional offence when communicating with people from varying cultures.

'It is also paramount in international business situations, where different cultures adhere to entirely different codes of conduct.'
