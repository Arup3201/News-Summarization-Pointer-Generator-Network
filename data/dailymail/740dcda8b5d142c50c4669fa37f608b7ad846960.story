It's been 50 years since Mary Poppins first burst onto cinema screens with her wise words, magical umbrella and bottomless bag. So to celebrate her half century, Britain's famous brand of Norland Nannies, hired by the rich, royal and famous, are giving back to families in need.

The Norland Agency has partnered with the Twins and Multiple Births Association (Tamba) to provide a service called Helping Hands, which gives free practical short-term support in the home for parents with twins, triplets and more who are in crisis.

It's a far cry from the usual Norland clientele, which includes the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The royals hired Norland graduate 
Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo to help them care for Prince George.

Mick Jagger 
and his ex-wife Jerry Hall used a Norland nanny when their children were
 young, while Princess Anne and the Duchess of York are among royalty 
who have called upon their services.

One of the nannies involved in the scheme is Ishbel Brown, 26, from Northumberland.

She told MailOnline why she has volunteered: 'I feel privileged that I've been able to train at Norland so I wanted to give something back,' she said.

'It's expensive having one baby so imagine when you need double or triple of everything. It can be really hard for families to cope.

'But it's inspiring to see how resourceful they can be. Lots of families can't afford brand new toys but give a baby a wooden spoon and a pan and they can be occupied for hours.'

As an experienced nanny of six years, Ishbel knows how challenging it can be for parents to care for just one baby at a time. So what advice does she have for people with twins and triplets?

'There's no magic formula - you have to work around the babies. Some are happy to be fed 
together and in some cases it's possible to breastfeed twins at the same
 time,' she explains.

'It's very common with twins to top up 
with formula but it all depends on the mother's milk supply. It's even 
harder with triplets. I've personally never met a mum of triplets who 
has solely breastfed.

'I recommend people go to as many support and play groups aimed at parents with twins and triplets as possible - like the ones run by Tamba.

'Having multiples can feel really overwhelming, so it's good to talk to people in the same situation.'

With their crisp brown uniforms, impeccable manners and traditional values, the Norland Nannies are often compared to the fictional Mary Poppins - made famous by the Disney film which was first released 50 years ago starring Julie Andrews. 

But Norland has been training nannies for far longer than Mary Poppins has been a firm family favourite.

The college in Bath was founded by Emily Ward in 1892 under the motto 'Love Never Faileth'.

Alongside child care, the students have always learnt how to cook, sew and administer first aid. 

But they have also moved with the times, and more recent graduates have been trained in self defence and even been advised on how to escape from paparazzi.

The latter has become necessary since the nannies are the go-to service for A-Listers looking for an extra pair of hands to help with their offspring.

Ishbel said she believes the services of the Norland nannies remain in demand because parents still want to imbue their children with traditional values.

'Norland teaches us to have fun with the children in our care but to also ensure that they grow up respectfully with good morals and good manners,' she explains.

As well as undertaking their usual workload, in the past year, Noland Nannies have pulled on their distinctive uniforms to provide 1644 hours of free help to more than 17 struggling families. 

These parents may have been coping with everything from severe medical complications, to parental bereavement, postnatal depression and serious behavioural problems.

Claire Burgess, early years consultant for Norland and honorary consultant for Tamba said: 'Norland is so pleased to be able to support families of multiples in this way and have been overwhelmed by the response from our nannies who have volunteered their time and expertise without any charge.'

Whilst the Norland Nannies provide the free help, Tamba covers the nannies' travel expenses and accommodation through the charity's Helping Hands fund.

Keith Reed, Tamba CEO said: 'We are so grateful for the support that Norland Nannies provide our families. Each week we receive phone calls from parents who are at breaking point for all kinds of reasons, whether from financial pressures, a marriage breakdown or deterioration in health. Any family can find themselves in a crisis but with Norland's support these families can move towards getting back on their feet.'

To be eligible for the Helping Hands programme families need to have multiples, be unable to afford to pay for help themselves and be in serious need of assistance. Families must have sought help from family, friends, neighbours or other external agencies and will need to receive support for their application from a health professional.

Those families that are not eligible under the Helping Hands criteria will be directed to other sources of support that are appropriate for their individual situation.
