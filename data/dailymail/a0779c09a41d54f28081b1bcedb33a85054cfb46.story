Monday's Europa League might not have been the main event in Nyon but it still managed to throw-up some intriguing knockout ties for Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Celtic.

All four British clubs face tough last 32 matches as they battle to make it all the way to next May's final in Warsaw - a match which now has the added prize of a Champions League spot for the winners.

With the Reds coming up against Turkish giants Besiktas, Spurs facing Italian outfit Fiorentina, Everton travelling to Switzerland to take on Young Boys and Celtic and Inter Milan playing out a repeat of the 1976 European Cup final, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the next stage of the Europa League.

The winners of the Europa League will win this trophy and a spot in next season's Champions League

LIVERPOOL vs BESIKTAS 

Will Liverpool be happy with the draw?

Sort of. Brendan Rodgers will be pleased to avoid former Reds boss Rafa Benitez and his Napoli side, while Inter Milan, Fiorentina, Sporting Lisbon and Zenit St Petersburg would all have provided stern tests.

But Besiktas, who won their group ahead of Tottenham, will not be a pushover and could cause the out-of-form Merseysiders problems, particularly in Turkey.

Star man - Demba Ba

Former Chelsea and Newcastle striker Ba has been in excellent form for Besiktas since swapping London for Istanbul last summer.

The 29-year-old netted five goals in four group stage appearances and will be keen to impress against Premier League opposition in February next year.

Have they met before?

Yes. The two teams came up against each other in the group stage of the Champions in 2007-08, with the Reds losing 2-1 in Turkey before thrashing Besiktas 8-0 at Anfield.

EVERTON vs YOUNG BOYS

Will Everton be happy with the draw?

Yes. Considering the Toffees could have drawn Roma, Ajax and Sevilla, facing the Swiss side gives Roberto Martinez's men a fantastic chance of reaching the last 16.

Star man - Guillaume Hoarau

With five goals in six Europa League group games, Hoarau will pose the biggest threat to Everton's chances of advancing further in the competition.

The former Paris Saint-Germain striker, who has five caps for France, is will be looking to make an impression when Young Boys host their Premier League counterparts on February 19. 

Have they met before?

No. February's two-legged tie will be the first time the two sides have clashed.

TOTTENHAM vs FIORENTINA

Will Tottenham be happy with the draw?

Not really. The trip to Florence will be tough, particularly given the hostile atmosphere created at the Stadio Artemio Franchi.

Spurs could have faced Club Brugges, Red Bull Salzburg and Legia Warsaw, all of which would've been easier ties on paper.

Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen (L-R) can expect a trip to Italy in February

Star man - Juan Cuadrado

Heavily linked with the likes of Barcelona and Manchester United last summer, Cuadrado has continued to impress for the Italian outfit this season.

The Colombian international has struck four goals in Serie A and the Europa League this term and also has three assists to his name.

Have they met before?

Never. The first-leg at White Hart Lane on February 19 will be their first ever meeting.

CELTIC vs INTER MILAN 

Will Celtic be happy with the draw?

It could’ve been a lot worse for Celtic, but they won’t be overly confident of upsetting the odds against one of Europe’s biggest names, even if Inter have fallen on tough times recently.

Star man - Samir Handanovic 

It’s coming to something when your goalkeeper is a definite star man, but Handanovic is the only player to consistently put in decent performances and who genuinely could earn a move elsewhere.

Have they met before? 

Celtic’s greatest night in their history came against Inter back in 1967. The Lisbon Lions defeat the Italian giants 2-1 in the European Cup final on an evening to have gone down in folklaw. Inter have never beaten the Bhoys, with the pair drawing both games in 1972.
