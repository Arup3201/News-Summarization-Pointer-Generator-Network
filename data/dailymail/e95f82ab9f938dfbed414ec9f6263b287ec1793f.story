An Army National Guardsman was in a jealous rage when killed his former girlfriend and another man before fatally shooting himself in northern Utah early on Monday, according to police.

Before embarking on his killing spree, Jared Tolman, 23, left a suicide note at his home in Logan in which he admitted that what he was about to do was selfish.

Tolman is reported to have sent a series of unanswered text messages to Mackenzie Madden before he kicked down the door of her apartment two blocks from Utah State University shortly after midnight on Monday.

He then fired an assault rifle multiple times at Madden, 19, and her friend Johnathon Sadler, 25, both people he knew, police said.

‘Basically there were three boys all interested in the same girl,’ Logan Police Lt. Rod Peterson told KSL.com.

‘Mr. Tolman is one of the three men that is interested in MacKenzie, and I’m not sure he was particularly fond of whatever relationship Johnathon had with MacKenzie.’

It's unclear if Tolman knew beforehand that Sadler was in Madden's home, although that might have triggered his actions, said Peterson.

Stephanie 
Powers, a former roommate of Madden, confirmed that Tolman and Madden 
had at one stage been in a serious relationship.

‘They
 were dating. I don't know if they were still dating when this happened.
 He seemed like a nice guy. He seemed to have his head on straight. So 
it's kind of shocking,’ she told KSL.

Madden
 was a sociology major at the university in Logan, a city of about 
48,000 people 80 miles north of Salt Lake City.

Officers responding to 
911 calls found her and Sadler dead inside the unit.

The
 gunman then went to another apartment a few miles away, authorities 
said, to look for a man he believed was involved with Madden. But the 
man was not home because he was staying with family.

‘When
 he did not find him at home, as I suspect he thought he would, he 
turned the gun on himself and shot himself,’ Peterson said.

Madden and Sadler's bodies were found in her apartment (pictured above) shortly after midnight Monday morning

Two other people were in that apartment at the time and called 911.

Investigators found Tolman’s suicide note on Monday.

He had graduated from Utah State University in May with a degree in political science, university spokesman Tim Vitale said.

Tolman
 had joined the National Guard in 2009 and was assigned to a support 
battalion for the 19th Special Forces Unit, where his chief duty was 
handling laundry. He had no history of disciplinary issues.

Logan
 police said the same gun was used in all three shootings on Monday. 
They did not confirm whether Tolman owned the assault rifle, but said it
 was not a government-issued weapon.

Weapon: Police say the gun Tolman used was personal and not government-issued. According to his Facebook, Tolman was a gun enthusiast, with several pictures posted of him clutching firearms

Madden was registered for classes this fall and was set to graduate in December, Vitale said.

She interned with Logan police in fall 2013, where she compiled research on active shooter situations, Lt. Brad Franke said.

‘She wanted to save the world. I'm personally just shocked and saddened by this terrible loss, he said. ‘She was a great kid.’
