A fifth student at Wesleyan University has been arrested in connection with a 'bad batch' of party drug Molly that resulted in the hospitalization of 12 people, including two in a critical condition.

Abhimanyu Janamanchi, 21, was among those treated at Hartford Hospital, 20 miles north of the college's campus in Middletown, Connecticut, on February 22 after taking the popular stimulant.

He surrendered to police Friday morning on a warrant for drug charges relating to the particular batch of Molly, which officials believe may have included a mix of various designer drug chemicals.

Now, he has been charged with distribution of a hallucinogen, possession of a hallucinogen and possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell, among other counts.

Other suspects: Last month, four other students were charged in connection with the drug overdoses. They included Eric Lonergan (left), 22, of Rio de Janeiro,  and Rama Agha Al Nakib (right), 20, a Syrian national

Also detained: The other two suspects are Zachary Kramer (left), 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, who was also released last month after posting a $5,000 bond, and Andrew Olson (right), of Atascadero, California

He has also been suspended from Wesleyan. 'Given the nature of the charges, we immediately suspended this student pending a formal hearing,' college spokesman Lauren Rubenstein said.

'Wesleyan takes very seriously allegations concerning the distribution of dangerous drugs.'

Janamanchi, from Rockville, Maryland, is the fifth student to be arrested over the on-campus drug overdoses, which affected ten students at the private liberal arts school, as well as two visitors. 

Some of the victims had attended a rave music show on the night of February 21. The calls for medical attention began the next morning. Four students were transported to Hartford Hospital.

One student was found unresponsive with no vital signs and was revived by paramedics who used six defibrillator shocks and numerous chest compressions, according to court affidavits.

The student and another victim were described as being in a 'critical condition'. Last week, the family of the only person who remained in the hospital said that 'against all odds', they would survive.

Victims who were in a less serious condition were treated at Middlesex Hospital. Following the overdoses, Wesleyan's president has urged students to 'turn in the drug dealers' via letter. 

Last week, four other students were charged in connection with the drug overdoses. They included Eric Lonergan, 22, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Rama Agha Al Nakib, 20, a Syrian national.

Both suspects were later released after posting $50,000 bonds.

The other two suspects are Zachary Kramer, 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, who posted a $5,000 bond, and Andrew Olson, of California. Like Janamanchis, all four students have been suspended.

In court last Wednesday, Jennifer Zito, Kramer's lawyer, asked the public to reserve judgment.

Dangerous: Molly (file picture) is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA, which can drive up body temperature and cause liver, kidney or cardiovascular failure

'These are very, very bright students, who have bright futures ahead of them and we certainly don't want to make any judgments at this time,' she said.

Molly is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA, which can drive up body temperature and cause liver, kidney or cardiovascular failure.

But experts say it often is cut with other drugs that can make the health risks unpredictable.  

Ms Rubenstein said Wesleyan, which has 3,200 students, would 'continue to cooperate with state and local officials to do everything we can to make our community as safe as possible'.

Janamanchi's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
