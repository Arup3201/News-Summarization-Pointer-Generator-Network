Chelsea Clinton and Jimmy Kimmel teamed up Monday to help announce a new program called Serve a Year that asks college and high school grads to spend a year contributing to their communities rather than immediately moving into college or the work force.

The pair spoke at the launch of non-profit ServiceNation's 'Serve A Year' campaign on Monday in Los Angeles.

The initiative seeks to make a year of service with organizations like Americorps, Habitat for Humanity and others the norm for graduates with the help of the entertainment industry, where some major players have pledged to insert positive messages about a year of service into programming aimed at Millennials.

Chelsea Clinton and late night host Jimmy Kimmel teamed up Monday in Los Angeles to push for Serve a Year -- an initiative that urges high school and college graduates to serve their communities for a year after graduating

'We know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities, and so I think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today,' Clinton said

'It's great to see so many people, especially young people, dedicating yourselves to public service because you care about people and not because a court ordered you to,' Kimmel joked at the Serve a Year launch in Los Angeles on Monday.

'The goal of this mission is essentially to put less focus on yourself and put more focus on others,' he said, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Over the next three years, ServiceNation hopes that mission will be accomplished by portraying the perks of service in television and movies, according to the Serve A Year website.

Their hope is that, with the help of partners like Comcast, Airbnb and the Clinton Foundation, non-profits like Habitat for Humanity, Teach for America and Americorps will have both added resources and new recruits after word spreads about the merits of serving a year.

'We know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities, and so I think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today,' Clinton told the Hollywood Reporter.

'In order to reach millennials, we need to go where they already are, and the entertainment industry has the megaphone and audience to help us get the word out and change the cultural expectation of what it means to grow up in America.'

Executive director of ServiceNation, Zach Maurin, told KABC the year of service comes with a paycheck and a scholarship.

'This is about giving them the skills and experiences they need, so they can support themselves while they're helping to change peoples' lives,' Maurin said.
