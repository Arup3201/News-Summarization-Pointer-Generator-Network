Footballer Carlos Tevez could face jail after being arrested on suspicion of driving while disqualified.

Tevez, who was banned from driving for six months on January 16 for failing to respond to police letters, was arrested yesterday near his home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

The Manchester City striker was bailed because there was no interpreter at Macclesfield Police Station. He is to return there on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman for Cheshire Police 
said: 'At 5.13pm yesterday police arrested a 29-year-old man from 
Alderley Edge on the A538 in Macclesfield.

'The man was arrested on suspicion of driving whilst disqualified and has since been released on police bail.'

The maximum penalty for driving while disqualified is a six-month custodial sentence and a fine of £5,000. Courts also consider anti-social behaviour orders and community service.

He was banned and fined £1,540 in January for failing to respond to police letters.

The
Argentinian was banned by Manchester Magistrates after pleading guilty 
to two counts of failing to furnish information relating to incidents in
which his Hummer vehicle was clocked speeding.

He also admitted not having a proper UK driving licence.

At the time, the striker, who did not attend the hearing in person, pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to furnish information in relation to the incidents.

The first offence took place in Morecambe, Lancashire, on March 28 - the
night he played for City's reserves against Morecambe Reserves.

The court heard the Hummer was clocked doing 39mph in a 30mph zone and 
Tevez failed to respond to letters sent to him by police on April 3 and 
May 4.

The second incident took place on May 8 when the car was seen at 66mph 
in a 50mph zone in Crewe, Cheshire, and he again failed to respond to 
letters from the police about it.

He argued that he had not responded because he didn't understand the 
word 'constabulary' in those sent from Cheshire Constabulary and Lancashire Constabulary.

The footballer’s solicitor, Gwyn Lewis, told the court: 'He does understand the word "police", but not more complicated words.

'The word constabulary is not one that is recognised internationally, but of course police is,' Mr Lewis said.

'The correspondence was not dealt with properly and that has resulted in these offences.'

Tevez was allegedly at the wheel of a white Porsche Cayenne when he was held by police yesterday as a result of 'information provided'.

A spokesman for Manchester City said the club considered it a police matter and they will not be making any comment.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
