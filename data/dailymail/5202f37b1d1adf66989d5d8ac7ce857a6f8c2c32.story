Rebecca Adlington expects Great Britain's swimmers to be a future force after a post-London 2012 revival.

Britain's most successful swimmer is now retired after winning two gold medals aged 19 at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and two bronze medals four years later in London.

Those third-placed finishes were part of a haul of just three British medals in the swimming pool in a disappointing display which Adlington does not expect to be repeated in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

Rebecca Adlinton said she expects a bright future for British swimmers after a poor showing at London 2012

The 25-year-old from Mansfield, who recently married swimmer Harry Needs, takes confidence from the haul of medals won at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Adlington said: 'It was amazing to see the guys swimming so well, being so happy.

'These guys weren't just winning, they weren't just getting medals, they were posting world-class times.

'A lot of people with the Commonwealth Games were saying 'USA aren't there, China aren't there'.

'It didn't matter, because the times they were posting rivalled the rest of the world, so it's going to be interesting going into the World Championships next year and see how good these guys can be.

'They aren't fazed who they stand up next to any more. They're all their to be beaten.

Adlington won two bronze medals at the London Olympics to add to the two golds she won in Beijing

'Everyone in the pool has that attitude which is absolutely incredible.'

The strength in depth is best illustrated in the men's breaststroke events, where pre-race favourite and London 2012 silver medallist Michael Jamieson was beaten to Commonwealth 200metres gold by fellow Scot Ross Murdoch.

Adam Peaty, the Commonwealth and European 100m champion, Andrew Willis and others are also ensuring competition is tight.

Adlington added: 'The depth is fantastic. Men's breaststroke is just insane. Only two people can go to the World Championships.

'When you've got four guys in the top 10 in the world fighting for two places, they're going to have to be on form and on target.

British swimmers performed well at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games both in terms of medals and times 

'They can't relax at the trials, which can only be good.

'That's what you've got to do at the World Championships. You've got to step up in the heats and semi-finals and post PBs (personal best times) just to make it through.'

While enthusiastic about the improvement in British swimming, Adlington does not yearn for a return to the water.

'I don't miss the competition element,' she added.

'I try to go in the pool as much as I can. It's such a nice way to relax. It's a nice way to think about your day and problem solve. It's a nice time to get 30 minutes to yourself thinking, as well as doing something productive.'
