A job description for a lowly internship at the London office of book publisher Dalkey Archive Press has revealed a ridiculous lists of demands that makes Meryl Streep's demanding boss in The Devil Wears Prada appear tame by comparison. 

The company, which publishes 
avant-garde and experimental books, is currently seeking 
'unpaid interns' to work in it’s London office, although 'one or two people may be appointed with short-term paid contracts.’

The
long and rambling job description posted on the publisher's website features a long list of demands and requires perspective employees to sacrifice all personal and professional commitments including holidays or weddings to attend in Rio, to focus on the unpaid work.

The job description for an internship at Dalkey Archive Press makes it sound like an even more extreme version of The Devil Wears Prada

An internship at a book publishing 
company sounds like a dream job for many young graduates, but the job description posted by Dalkey Archive Press
on Wednesday might be enough to make even the most desperate of 
aspiring literary-nerds think twice about what they might be getting 
into.

Demanding internships and entry-level jobs in
competitive industries have been dramatized for storylines in TV shows 
such as HBO series Girls and the movie The Devil Wears Prada. However 
those stories about demanding bosses and poorly paid roles don't hold a 
candle to the demands being made by Dalkey Archive Press.  

The job description starts by asking for interests you might typically expect from a 
perspective candidate including ‘strong interest in publishing’ and 
‘highly motivated and ambitious.’

Then the list of demands starts to become more extreme, candidates must be ‘determined to have a career in publishing and will sacrifice to make that career happen.’ 

The list of what the successful candidate will be expected to sacrifice is long and quite specific:
‘do not have any other commitments (personal or professional) that will
interfere with their work at the Press (family obligations, writing, 
involvement with other organizations, degrees to be finished, holidays 
to be taken, weddings to attend in Rio, etc).

If
that isn't enough, the lucky interns must 'know how to act and behave 
in a professional office environment with high standards of performance'
and 'have a commitment to excellence that can be demonstrated on a 
day-to-day basis.'

To 
reinforce how demanding this role will be, the next sentence in 
description is printed in capital letters and warns 'DO NOT APPLY IF ALL
OF THE ABOVE DOES NOT DESCRIBE YOU.'

In HBO series Girls, Hannah (played by Lena Dunham) gets fired from her internship at an independent publisher after asking to be paid

If perspective candidates aren't scared off already, the description then goes on to state the long list of offenses that unlucky interns could be fired for: 'Coming in late or leaving early without prior permission; being unavailable at night or on the weekends; failing to meet any goals; giving unsolicited advice about how to run things; taking personal phone calls during work hours; gossiping; misusing company property, including surfing the internet while at work; submission of poorly written materials; creating an atmosphere of complaint or argument; failing to respond to emails in a timely way; not showing an interest in other aspects of publishing beyond editorial; making repeated mistakes; violating company policies.'

Potential applicants are once again warned: 'DO NOT APPLY if you have a work history containing any of the above.'

For applicants confident that they fit the criteria and still willing to work for Dalkey Archieve Press, the job description warns candidates not too expect too much in the way of feedback from the publisher: 'We will not be able to acknowledge receipt of applications or provide feedback about your application. We will contact only those people whom we wish to ask further questions of or that we intend to interview. Do not contact us about your application.'

Job from hell? The job description to intern at Dalkey Archive Press is likely to make aspiring literary-nerds think twice about a career in publishing

An internship at a book publishing company may sound like a dream job for many young graduates, but judging from the job description to work at Dalkey Archive Press it could turn out to be a nightmare

The ridiculous job description recalls demanding internships and entry-level jobs dramatized in the TV Girls and the movie The Devil Wears Prada.

At the start of HBO series Girls, Hannah (actress and show creator Lena Dunham) gets fired from her internship at an independent publisher after she dares to ask to be paid. Dunham interned in real life at independent publisher Soft Skull in 2006 and based the storyline on the experience.

In The Devil Wears Prada, Anne Hathaway stars as a college graduate who goes to New York City and lands the job 'a million girls would kill for' as co-assistant to powerful fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (widely believed to have been Vogue editor Anna Wintour), played by Meryl Streep.
