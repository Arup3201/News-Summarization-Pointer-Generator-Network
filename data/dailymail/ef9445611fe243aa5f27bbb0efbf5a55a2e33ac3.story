A garage boss crashed a customer’s £50,000 sports car, killing his niece’s fiance eight months before they were due to get married.

Peter Farwell lost control of the powerful two-seat Ariel Atom, which can accelerate faster than a Ferrari, near to his garage in Kent before crashing into trees.

Farwell and his passenger, Garry Jarrett, were both seriously hurt after clipping a kerb and careering off the road.

Garry was due to marry Sian Farwell (right), who gave birth to their son Alfie 10 months ago, in May next year

Garry, a 24-year-old father of one, was airlifted to hospital where he died a week later while Farwell escaped with ankle injuries.

Garry was planning to marry Farwell’s niece Sian Farwell, after the birth of their son Alfie just 10 months before.

Farwell, 47, was jailed for eight months by a judge sitting at Maidstone Crown Court after admitting causing death by careless driving and was banned from the road until July 2017.

Judge Michael Carroll heard that the car crashed in Kemsing, Kent, as Farwell was taking it back to the Forge Garage where he was servicing it.

The unnamed customer had given his permission for Farwell to take it out for a ride.

Police Constable Jamie Woodhams, from Kent Police’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'This, as in all fatal collisions, was a tragic case.

'Mr Jarrett’s fiancee, Farwell’s niece, had recently given birth to a son before this incident and our sympathies go out to the whole family.'

Garry's parents, Chris and Roger Jarrett, said their son was a 'loveable family man' who also worked for the family business Automatic Machine Services (AMS).

The £50,000 Ariel Atom can reach 60mph from a standing start in less than three seconds making it the third fastest-accelerating car in the world (file picture)

Chris said: 'He loved his little boy so much - the day Alfie was born was the happiest day of his whole life and he had wanted a son so much. That is the most heartbreaking thing about this.'

'We’re going to make sure Garry’s memory lives on through his son.'

Garry's wife said that only hours before the crash she and Mr Jarrett had returned from a holiday in Cyprus and said he was 'one in a million'.

'We had an amazing time and we’d finally booked our wedding, for May 2014.

'He just doted on Alfie, he would do everything he could for him, whatever he needed. His family was everything to him.'

Mr Jarrett was a car enthusiast and loved extreme sports, especially track days and bicycle racing.

The Somerset-made Ariel Atom has a Honda Civic engine which produces 300bhp and
is the third fastest accelerating car in the world, behind only the 
multi million pound Bugatti Veyron and the Ultima GTR.

During 
his review of the car on TVs Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson said: 'It’s fast 
on an entirely different level. I have never ever driven anything like 
it.'

The car does not have any body panels and the chassis acts as an exoskeleton to minmise weight.
