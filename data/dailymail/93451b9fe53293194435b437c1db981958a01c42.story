She was a young woman who had her dreams of being a model ruined when she became the victim of an acid attack instigated by her ex-boyfriend in 2008. 

But fast-forward seven years and Katie Piper has achieved her wildest dreams - and more. 

She's penned an autobiography, presents the successful Channel 4 show, Bodyshockers, launched an inspirational charitable organisation and took to the runway in Naomi Campbell's recent fashion week show.

And now, Katie, 31, is using her success story to help others by creating the first UK fashion catwalk that will include models with visible differences.

Katie Piper is launching the UK's first catwalk featuring models with visible differences. The event, taking place at The Ideal Home Show, will call on people from her charity foundation as well as members of the public

Launching at the Ideal Home Show this month, Katie is challenging the conventional catwalk with the launch of 'Confidence - The Secret.'

Speaking to FEMAIL about the initiative, she said: 'I am working with The Ideal Home Show as a fashion and beauty ambassador to launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from my foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity. It's all incredibly exciting.'

The shows, which take place on  March 20, 21 and  April 3, have a twist.

Those appearing on the catwalk will be bravely admitting what their true insecurities are, which aren’t always the obvious anxiety that people assume. 

Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the representatives will be emphasising that what others assume to be their insecurity isn’t always the case.

Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 when her ex-boyfriend employed an accomplice to throw a cup of industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face, is keen to reveal hers.

'You might look at me and think that's what I would be insecure about it, but it isn't,' she revealed. 'In fact, it's my height; I would love to be a bit taller.' 

In another UK first, Katie is also offering two people with visible differences the chance to join her catwalk.

'Anyone who would like to grace the catwalk and reveal their true insecurities simply needs to tweet a picture of their insecurity to me with the hashtag #KatiesSecret,' she said.

Last month, Katie rocked the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'

Explaining the inspiration behind the show's name, Katie said: 'It's called Confidence - The Secret because confidence is something you can use to express yourself and convey yourself and it's something I've used through several periods of my life.

'It's not about trying to look and be perfect, it's about a positive mindset and being the best version of yourself that you can possibly be.'

Katie, who  penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success.

'I can't express how important positive thinking is,' she said. 'When I was recovering from my attack, I would write lots of little powerful notes and stick them around the room. Before I walk onto the red carpet, I have a mantra and always repeat to myself "inhale confidence, exhale doubt"; it really is so powerful.

'It's all about looking at what you do have and not what you don't.'

Katie heeded her own advice recently when she took to the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'.

Her catwalk coup kicked off what looks set to be a successful year for Katie. She's penning a new book, due out later this month, is working on a third series of Bodyshockers and has been busy growing her charity.

If that wasn't enough, Katie is planning her wedding, mothering her one-year-old daughter and training for a triathlon, too.

She added: 'No matter what you look like, you can live a full life and that's what I want to show with Confidence - The Secret.'
