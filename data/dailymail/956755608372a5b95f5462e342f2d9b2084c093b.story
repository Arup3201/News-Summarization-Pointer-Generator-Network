Emmerdale actress Gemma Oaten has spoken out about an eating disorder that could have claimed her life.

The 30-year-old actress from Hull started starving herself at the age of ten when she fell under the grip of body dysmorphia.

'I have a vivid memory of getting out of the bath when I was ten and looking down and at my body and asking my dad, "am I fat?"' she revealed on today's This Morning.

Emmerdale actress Gemma Oaten smiled and waved at the cameras as she arrived at the ITV Studios today to share her story on This Morning of how an eating disorder could have killed her

The soap star told presenters Eammon Holmes and Ruth Langsford that her eating disorder was a mental health illness. 

She wasn't trying to be thin out of vanity or because she was influenced by pictures of slim celebrities in magazines.

'It started when ten years old, I was reading the Beano and Dandy back then,' she said. 'My feelings towards myself were changing, I was getting bullied at school. 

'The onset of puberty played a massive factor as I went from being a tomboy full of personality and bubbly.

'I remember going through puberty and all of a sudden the boys I had played football with, I was playing kiss chase with, and then girls started to get jealous. I couldn't control what they said about me but I could control what was happening inside me.

'It's heartbreaking to say it but I remember looking in the mirror and thinking if there's less of me, there's less of me for people to see and hurt.' 

Gemma, pictured on This Morning, said her eating disorder began when she was just ten-years-old

Gemma's weight plummeted to four-and-a-half stone and it was then that her parents Dennis and Marg intervened and made her seek help.

'I was killing myself in front of my family, it caused a lot of heartache for all of us,' she admitted.

She was sent to a children's psychiatric unit but she said 'it wasn't the right place for me personally, it was a very scary time.'

Elaborating on this point in today's Mirror, she said: 'The memories of my time in hospital were very bleak and full of despair. I found myself in quite scary situations. I had things thrown at my head, I'd have people discussing in detail how they were abused, people cutting themselves in front of me. It was horrendous.

'I wasn't showing signs of psychosis, I was just a young girl suffering from an illness and, yes, it was a mental health illness but it is very different to somebody who is schizophrenic or who cuts herself.

'It all went wrong because it focused on getting the calories down me and not dealing with the reason I was struggling with an eating disorder.

Gemma, pictured eight in a scene from Emmerdale, joined the soap in 2011 and is now using her public profile to raise awareness of eating disorders

'In the end my parents made the decision to take me out of there when they found out what was going on.'

It wasn't until her 20s that she was fully on the road to recovery and finally able to beat the eating disorder. 

'The turning point was at 20 when my best friend killed himself. I looked around at the funeral and saw how devastated everyone was and I thought "I'm doing same, I can't do this anyone, I have to get better",' she recalled on This Morning. 

Gemma was not being over-dramatic, according to the charity Beat, eating disorders claim more lives than any other mental illness – one in five of the most seriously affected will die prematurely from the physical consequences or suicide. 

Gemma, who appeared on This Morning to promote Eating Disorder Awareness Week is now thankful she got the help she needed before it was too late.

She started having therapy and says she's now fully recovered.

She said: 'I'm fine now and I am speaking out about it as I want people to look at me and see I am not ashamed I had an eating disorder and now I'm well.'

Gemma joined the cast of Emmerdale in 2011 and is now in a relationship with actor Andy Barnes, who joined her on the This Morning sofa today.

She said it's thanks to the support of her friends and family that she survived and she urges other sufferers to seek help as soon as possible. 

'My message is for people to talk about how they are feeling and not feel shame,' she said.
