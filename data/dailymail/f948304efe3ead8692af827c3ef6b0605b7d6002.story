Gunfire rang out and buildings were set ablaze in Grozny this morning as the Chechen capital witnessed a battle that left at least 10 policemen and nine militants dead.

More than six hours after fighting broke out, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said a multi-story building the militants had occupied in central Grozny had been destroyed by fire and six gunmen killed.

He later raised the total number of dead gunmen to nine after several more were found in a city school and an operation launched to 'liquidate' them. Several buildings in the city were left devastated by fire.

Unrest is common across the North Caucasus, which has been gripped by an Islamist insurgency going back to the collapse of the Soviet Union. But forceful measures have spared Grozny significant violence for several years.

Security officials and Mr Kadyrov said militants travelling in several cars killed three traffic police at a checkpoint in Grozny. This was disputed by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, which cited an unidentified law enforcement source as saying five police officers were killed.

An Associated Press reporter saw the building - a publishing house - in flames and heard the sound of heavy-calibre gunfire before dawn, several hours after the unrest erupted.

The AP reporter also saw the body of someone in civilian clothing in the street near the publishing house as fighting continued. It was not clear how and when the person had been killed.

The Moscow-based National Anti-Terrorist Committee, a federal agency, announced it had imposed a counter-terrorism regime on the centre of Grozny.

This officially allows heightened security measures to be enforced, and typically indicates the imminent use of heavy force to quash unrest.

Life News, a news outlet believed to have links to Russian security services, cited police as saying about 15 people had seized three cars late last night in the village of Shalazhi and drove to Grozny, some 30 miles away.

Mr Kadyrov said on his Instagram account, which he uses to issue public statements, that the traffic police officers were shot dead as they attempted to stop the cars carrying the gunmen.

In a message posted several hours later, Mr Kadyrov said that six militants were killed in the standoff at the publishing house.

'Not one bandit managed to get out. I directly ran the operation myself,' he wrote.

Mr Kadyrov posted a picture showing the lower half of an apparently dead gunman lying beside a rifle. It was not immediately clear if it showed one of the attackers.

Dmitry Trenin, chief of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter 'the night attack in Grozny looks senseless, except as an attempt to embarrass (Russian president Vladimir) Putin hours before his annual address to parliament.'

Mr Putin, who is to give his state of the nation address on Thursday, already was under pressure to reassure Russians as fears grow over soaring inflation and a plummeting ruble.

A fresh outbreak of violence could further damage Mr Putin, who has been able to claim success in subduing Chechnya's Islamic insurgency after years of violence and two full-scale wars.

But militant jihadist group the Caucasus Emirate, which follows a hardline Salafist Muslim ideology, has continued to launch attacks despite Chechen separatists officially ending their armed resistance.

The Kavkaz Center website, a mouthpiece for Islamic militant groups operating in Russia's North Caucasus, carried a link to a video message by an individual claiming responsibility for the attacks.

The man in the video claimed to be operating under orders from Chechen Islamist leader Aslan Byutukayev, known to his followers as Emir Khamzat.

A few years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chechnya was plunged into a full-scale war when separatist rebels pursued independence for the republic.

The violence was largely confined to that small republic, but rebels ventured into other parts of Russia.

A fragile peace settlement was reached with Moscow until 1999, when an insurgency movement increasingly inspired by radical Islamist ideas reignited the conflict.

A military crackdown succeeded by years of aggressive rule by Mr Kadyrov has quietened the region, pushing unrest to neighbouring provinces.

Mr Kadyrov has been widely denounced for human rights abuses, including allegations of killing opponents. He has also imposed some Islamic restrictions on the region, including mandatory public headscarves for women.

After two bloody wars and a violent separatist movement, Chechnya has in recent years seen a period of relatively quiet.

That calm was punctured this morning when a group of gunmen went on the rampage in the Russian republic's capital, shooting dead at least three police officers.

The Chechen struggle for independence goes back to the fall of the Soviet Union, when local leaders formed an independence movement opposed to Boris Yeltsin's vision for a Russian Federation.

The First Chechen War began in 1994 when Russian forces marched in to regain control over Chechnya following a 1991 declaration of independence.

They faced serious opposition and, despite superiority in numbers and weaponry, and finance from the U.S., Russian forces were unable to establish control and Yeltsin signed a peace treaty in 1997.

But despite the Chechen victory, that war displaced nearly half a million people and obliterated the country's infrastructure, while Islamists continued their insurgency against the new government.

In October 1999 the Russian army again marched in, responding to an attack by the Islamic International Brigade on the neighbouring republic of Dagestan and a string of terror attacks in Russian cities, including Moscow.

This time the invasion was much better planned and executed and, despite continuing terror attacks including the notorious Beslan school massacre, Russian public opinion held firm and the Kremlin tightened its grip.

In 2003 a referendum was held on a new Chechen constitution reuniting the country with Russia. It was passed with 95.5 per cent of the vote on a claimed turnout of 80 per cent, numbers regarded sceptically by many observers.

Russia finally pulled out in 2009 and ended its counter-terrorism operation. Three months later the leader of the separatist movement called for a halt for armed resistance. Islamist-inspired attacks continue, however.
