Leonard Greenberger, a partner at a Washington D.C. PR firm, has written a guide on how to win people over in disputes called 'What to Say When Things Get Tough'

Greenberger told WBAL that hostile conversations are unique in that the 'normal rules of communication got out the window.'

If you want to get your point heard and accepted in these situations you need to prove that you are trustworthy and credible. Greenberger says you have to demonstrate four things: that your caring, open, honest and an expert.

Expert: Greenberger has had to deal with a lot of uncomfortable situations as a partner at a Washington, D.C. PR firm

A good way of going about this is by telling stories that people can relate to.

Greenberger uses the example of David Axelrod, President Obama's former senior adviser.

One morning, Greenberger heard Axelrod talking about healthcare reform on a Sunday talk show. Axelroad shared a personal story about how his own daughter was born with epilepsy and how he and his wife always worried about how they were going to be able to afford her healthcare. With the Obamacare, that's not something they would have to worry about as much anymore.

That personal story was something that Greenberger could relate to since he has a daughter of his own.

'He made me a fan of his and also a bigger fan of the healthcare legislation,' Greenberger said.

Get your point across: In order to prove that you are trustworthy and credible you must demonstrate that you are caring, open, honest and an expert

But more important than what you say is what you do. Physical actions are three times more important in terms of establishing trust and credibility, Greenberger says.

Pay attention to everything you're doing, make good eye contact, and keep your hands out. Don'tÂ  put them behind your back or in your pockets or cross your arms.

'All of those send negative signals to people who are worried, angry or suspicious of what you're saying - you are a dishonest person,' he said.

And like most situations, it's good to keep a positive attitude.

Greenberger says that people will often go into hostile situation with a defensive crouch because they're worried.

'People might be angry or upset, but you need to be positive,' he says. 'You have a good story to tell and that's your job.'

Keep calm: Whatever you do, don't fidget. Movements like breaking eye contact and folding your arms send negative signs to the person you're trying to communicate with and will have them writing you off
