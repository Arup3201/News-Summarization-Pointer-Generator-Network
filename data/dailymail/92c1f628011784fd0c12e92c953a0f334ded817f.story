Jailed: Denis MacShane has been sentenced to six months in prison for cheating his expenses

A former Labour minister was jailed for six months yesterday for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in parliamentary expenses to pay for jaunts to Europe.

Denis MacShane, who had previously dismissed the expenses scandal ‘as a wonderful moment of British fiddling’, said ‘Cheers’ as his sentence was announced.

The one-time BBC journalist then muttered ‘quelle surprise’ as he was led from the dock. MacShane, 65, had admitted faking 19 invoices for ‘research and translation services’ amounting to £12,900 between 2005 and 2008.

He submitted them through a company that he set up under a false identity and used nine different spellings of his name so officials would think the paperwork had been filled in by others.

A minister for Europe under Tony Blair, MacShane used the money to fund trips to the Continent, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris.

Jailing him, Mr Justice Sweeney said his ‘considerable and repeated’ dishonesty had ‘reduced confidence in our priceless democratic system’.

‘There was deliberate, oft repeated and prolonged dishonesty over a period of years – involving a flagrant breach of trust and consequent damage to Parliament,’ he said.

‘You were an MP – and a minister at the time of four of the claims – and knew that you were required to act with probity and transparency in the making of expenses claims. You deliberately created misleading and deceptive invoices and then used them in order to procure payments of public money.’

Mr Justice Sweeney said the deception was calculated to avoid suspicion falling on his claims before adding: ‘You have no one to blame but yourself.’

Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane’s claims in 2009 when the expenses scandal engulfed Westminster. John Lyon, the Commons’ Standards Commissioner, raised concerns over claims for ‘translation services’ from the European Policy Institute – a think-tank that he founded.

MacShane first admitted to officials that he had submitted invoices signed with what he called ‘a nom de plume’ and described the EPI as a ‘convenient vehicle’ to fund research trips to the continent.

But a subsequent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee described his actions as the ‘gravest case which has come to us for adjudication, rather than being dealt with under the criminal law’.

It recommended that MacShane should be suspended as an MP for 12 months but he resigned as the member for Rotherham in November 2012 before the punishment could be imposed.

'Cheers, quelle surprise': MacShane outside court. One former Labour colleague sprang to his defence

Police, who had dropped an investigation in 2009, reopened their inquiry and MacShane was charged in May.

He was the sixth MP to be prosecuted over expenses and admitted false accounting at the Old Bailey last month.

Notably absent from court was his girlfriend, Vicky Pryce, 61, the ex-wife of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. She was released in May after serving two months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been picked up by Huhne, the former energy secretary, who was also jailed.

MacShane is expected to serve half his sentence before being released.

The invoices were signed by MacShane under the name of E.J. Matthews, the general manager of the company based at an address in Fulham, south-west London.

Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane's claims in 2009 when the MPs' expenses scandal engulfed Westminster. He was referred to Scotland Yard within months.  

However, due to Parliamentary privilege, officers were unable to access damning evidence in which MacShane detailed how signatures on receipts from the European Policy Institute (EPI) had been faked.

It was not until after police dropped the case last year that the cross-party standards committee published the evidence in a report that recommended an unprecedented 12-month suspension from the House.

MacShane, who served as Europe minister under Tony Blair, resigned as MP for Rotherham last November before his suspension could be imposed.

He accepted that he made a 'grotesque mistake', but argued there was no personal gain from the claims.

The Glasgow-born politician, who was elected as an MP in 1994, was the sixth MP to face court proceedings over the expenses scandal that rocked Westminster.

Elliot Morley, David Chaytor, Jim Devine, and Eric Illsley were locked up in 2011 for fiddling their expenses - all four men have now been released from prison.

Grief: MacShane's ex-partner Carol Barnes, left, and their daughter Clare, right, both died in the past decade

Margaret Moran, who fiddled £53,000 in the worst case of dishonesty in the scandal, was let off with a two-year supervision and treatment order last December after claims she was suffering from mental illness.

Between them they claimed around £127,000, of which former environment minister Morley admitted to claiming more than £30,000.

Two Tory peers, Lord Taylor of Warwick and Lord Hanningfield, were jailed for cheating the taxpayer of around £25,000.

A fellow Labour MP argued that it was wrong to jail MacShane because he has already 'been punished enough' for his fraud and did not personally profit from the false claims.

Tom Harris, a former transport minister, said: 'Everyone accepts - the CPS and the police accept - that Denis did not personally gain from his behaviour.

'He admits that he was wrong and I think there was a very strong case for a non-custodial sentence. I think it is very disappointing that the judge decided to treat him as MPs who had gained personally from their fraudulent activities.

'Denis is not in the same category. He made no personal gain. He has been punished enough. He was forced out of Parliament, he had to give up his seat and I think he has suffered enough.'
