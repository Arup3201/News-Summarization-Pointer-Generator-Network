Offering plenty of selfie opportunities with the beloved cat, the first Sanrio licensed Hello Kitty Café in Australia has opened its doors in Adelaide.

From macaroons and mousses to birthday cakes and crème brûlées, the menu serves up cat-face treats for casual coffee dates, birthdays as well as high tea gatherings.

‘Our main focus will be on desserts and of course, everything from the food to the décor will feature the character,’ staff member Damaris Oaurovics told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We’ve got our own chefs to freshly make and bake all the desserts from scratch daily and also our own baristas to serve up hot or cold beverages.

‘We’re also looking at bringing out a savoury cafe-style menu in the future – so light meals like burgers, chips, salads, sandwiches and many more.’

Despite the Sanrio character famous for its 'pink theme', the coffee chain store is not decked out in pink but still stay true to its character with giant kitty figurines.

‘Our café is not pink – A lot of people assume that our café would be pink from the ceiling down to the floor but our colour code at the moment is brown, yellow, grey and white,' Ms Oaurovics said.

‘When the owner from Sanrio brought the café here, he decided to keep it simple and change the colours to make it look like a café-style place for everyone to enjoy.'

Ms Oaurovics added: ‘The reason why Adelaide was picked to opened its first Hello Kitty-themed café was because the business partners happened to live here.’
