There's a pile of office payslips sitting on the desk in front of you and no one else is around. Could you resist a little peek to reveal how much your colleagues are being paid?

If you think temptation would get the better of you - you are in the minority, but only just. 

A new study into nosy Britain revealed that in this enticing situation more than two in five (41 per cent) would not be able to restrain themselves.

Out of those, one in five (20 per cent) admitted they’d briefly skim through the top ones. A more daring eight per cent would flick through the whole stack whilst a less brave (but more devious) 13 per cent said they would try to find a trusted colleague to snoop in their stead.

Fifty per cent of Londoners said they would snoop on colleagues payslips but nearly two thirds of Scots and a similar proportion of Welsh respondents would resist believing it’s ‘none of their business’

The nosiest group by far were – perhaps unsurprisingly – competitive Londoners (50 per cent said they would snoop).

By far the least inquisitive were Scotland and Wales. Nearly two thirds of Scots (64 per cent) and a similar proportion (62 per cent) of Welsh respondents would resist looking at the payslips stating it’s ‘none of their business’.

Overwhelmingly, the West Midlands chose the less daring option of not looking at the payslips themselves but convincing a colleague to snoop instead.

The most likely (29 per cent) to quickly scan through the top of the pile were from the East Midlands, however North Westerners turned out to be the most intrepid: they were the most likely to read through the entire pile, even ahead of competitive Londoners.

The research was carried out by online anonymous diary site Pencourage.com as part of an experiment to discover how nosy and gossipy we are as a nation. The survey, which polled 2,000 individuals, also tested our our ability to keep a secret. 

The region most likely to tittle-tattle was the East Midlands, with a staggering 72 per cent admitting they’d be unable to keep the secret of an office affair

The telling research found that on discovering a work colleague was having an affair, a staggering two thirds of us would be unable to keep the knowledge to ourselves.

Only a meager 31 per cent would consider it to be ‘none of our business’ and keep mum.

Of the two thirds (66 per cent) who would be unable to contain themselves, a relatively cautious 36 per cent would only share the information with people outside the office but a less discreet 30 per cent admit they’d let the cat out of the bag at work.

Of those, one in ten would purposely drop subtle hints or try to share the secret anonymously, one in eight (13 per cent) would tell their closest co-workers and 4 per cent say that despite their best intentions they’d be likely to accidentally let it slip.

A rather judgmental 2 per cent would share the information openly with everyone, feeling morally justified to do so. 

A new study into nosy Britain revealed 41 per cent would not be able to resist looking at confidential documents

One percent would ‘tell everyone’ because the secret is ‘too exciting to withhold!’

The region most likely to tittle-tattle was the East Midlands, with a staggering 72 per cent admitting they’d be unable to keep the secret. 

Once again Wales and Scotland were the most discreet, with 45 per cent and 42 per cent respectively saying it was ‘none of their business’

Those most likely to intend to keep schtum yet admit they’d probably accidentally let the secret slip were North Westerners – six times more likely to do this than East Anglians.

Surprisingly, Scots were the most likely by far to feel justified if openly sharing the information as ‘an affair is morally wrong’ – three times more likely to say this than other regions. 

No respondents from Northern Ireland, East Anglia or the East Midlands chose this option, compared with three per cent of Scots.

The poll was conducted by Pencourage, which already hosts close to 40,000 anonymous journals covering intimate aspects of people’s lives: from cheeky sexual escapades to accounts of infidelity, bereavement and addiction. 

It allows users – who cannot be identified even by the website’s own internal staff – to post 200 words about their lives each day alongside music, videos or photos.

Pencourage founder Peter Clayton said: 'The stratospheric growth our site has enjoyed since it launched shows there is clearly a natural curiosity about others’ private thoughts and real life confessions – as well as an inherent desire to share our own secrets, so we wanted to find out how these attitudes vary around the UK. 

'This research into our penchant for tittle-tattle shows that whilst Britons might have a reputation of keeping a ‘stiff upper lip’ we appear to have a very mobile lower one!'
