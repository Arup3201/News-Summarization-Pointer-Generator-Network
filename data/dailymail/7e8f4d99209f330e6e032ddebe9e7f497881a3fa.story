Nine new species of colourful, tree-climbing tarantulas have been discovered in Brazil, including four from a mysterious, ancient genus once thought to have been extinct.

The finds highlight how little is still known about the fauna of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, a habitat which is under serious threat from human encroachment.

'Instead of the seven species formerly known in the region, we now have sixteen', said Dr Rog√©rio Bertani, a tarantula specialist at the Instituto Butantan in Sao Paulo, who carried out the study.

The so-called arboreal tarantulas are known from a few tropical places in Asia, Africa, South and Central America and the Caribbean.

They generally have a lighter build, thinner bodies and longer legs than other kinds of tarantulas, which makes them better suited for their habitat.

Increased surface area at the ends of their legs makes them better equipped to clamber across different surfaces, while their light build makes them more agile.

Their core area is the Amazon, from where most of the species are known and normally very common, living in the jungle or even in domestic surroundings.

Dr Bertani's findings have been 
published in the open-access journal Zookeys, where he has described how
four of the new discoveries belong to the Typhochlaena genus that had 
once thought to be extinct.

Whether it's a shark or a tiny spider, there are many things out there that scare us.

But we may not be in as much danger as we think as our fears can make objects seem much closer than they actually are.

For fear can skew our perception of approaching objects, causing us to underestimate the distance of a threatening one, according to researchers from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and the University of London.

The findings, published in Current Biology, show that emotion and perception are subtly intertwined in the mind.

'In a resurrected genus with a mysterious single species known from 1841, we have now five species,' he said.

'These
are the smallest arboreal tarantulas in the world, and their analysis 
suggests the genus to be very old, so they can be considered relicts of a
formerly more widely distributed taxon'.

Other discoveries include new species,
Pachistopelma bromelicola, which lives inside bromeliads, a type of 
flowering plant which often contains water in overlapping leaf bases.

'Only a single species had been known to live exclusively inside these plants, and now we have another that specialized in bromeliads as well,' Dr Bertani said.

A further species, Iridopelma katiae, was found living inside the same kinds of plants at the top of table mountains where trees are rare.

'This species also inhabits bromeliads, one of the few places for an arboreal tarantula to live that offer water and a retreat against the intense sunlight' he said.

The discovery of all these new species outside the Amazon was unexpected and illustrates how little we know of the fauna surrounding us, even from hot spots of threatened biodiversity like the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and the Cerrado (a kind of savannah vegetation).

These species are highly endemic and the regions where they live are suffering high pressure from human activities, according to the research.

Worse still, all these new species are colourful, which could attract the interest for capturing them for the pet trade, constituting another threat.
