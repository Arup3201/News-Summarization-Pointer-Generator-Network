Newcastle United are willing to pay the £2million compensation fee for Derby County boss Steve McClaren, Sportsmail understands.

Senior sources within St James’ Park are convinced that the former England manager will be their next head coach come the summer and say the £3.5m pocketed from Alan Pardew’s defection to Crystal Palace in January will cover the cost of his arrival.

It is McClaren’s relationship with United’s chief scout Graham Carr – in essence, the club’s director of football – which is the driving force behind their move for the 53-year-old.

Head coach John Carver looks set to be replaced come the end of the Premier League season

Carr has been tasked with finding the new boss should the Magpies decide to replace current head coach John Carver - and that is looking increasingly likely.

Sources at Newcastle have indicated McClaren is the only name being considered and they feel there is a willingness on his part to swap Pride Park for St James’ Park.

McClaren’s camp deny this, instead insisting he is fully focussed on winning promotion to the Premier League with Derby.

Despite a strong campaign, Derby are in danger of missing out on automatic promotion to the top flight

That, however, is to be expected given his promise to the club’s hierarchy that he would see out the season with the Rams when he was first linked with Newcastle in January.

McClaren signed a new three-year deal in August and chief executive Sam Rush has again insisted this week that their manager is going nowhere.

However, Derby are in danger of missing out on automatic promotion to the top flight and there is even a chance they could slip out of the play-off places.

They announced losses of £7m this week, compared to the £18.7m profit recorded by Newcastle, who intend to invest heavily in their playing squad this summer.

It is thought all of those factors will be enough for Carr to persuade McClaren to head to the North-East ahead of next season.
