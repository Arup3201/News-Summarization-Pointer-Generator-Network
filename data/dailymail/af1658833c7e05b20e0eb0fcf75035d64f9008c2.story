Inquiry: Roberto Laudisio, 21, had allegedly stolen a packet of cookies from a Sydney shop before he died after being Tasered by police

Chasing a suspected shoplifter across a city street, this is the moment a police officer fatally shoots a student with a Taser gun.

Brazilian Roberto Laudisio, 21, had allegedly stolen a packet of cookies from a convenience store in Sydney.

CCTV footage filmed in a nearby shop shows a man, said to be Mr Laudisio, running with a number of policemen in pursuit.

One officer then aims what looks like a Taser gun at the man, who is at that time off-screen.

Witnesses claim the Brazilian was shouting ‘Help me!’ as officers pinned him to the ground.

He stopped breathing and died at the scene.

Mr Laudisio had gone into the King 
Street convenience store at about 5.30am on Sunday and asked the cashier
for help because someone was trying to kill him, according to 
Australia’s Daily Telegraph newspaper.

When the cashier refused, Mr Laudisio allegedly stole a packet of cookies and ran out.

The
shirtless student was then chased onto nearby Pitt Street by police, 
who said they used pepper spray to try and subdue him before shooting 
him with a Taser gun.

The bare-chested student was Tasered by 
police three times, according to the Daily Telegraph. Officers claim 
they believed that Mr Laudisio had a weapon because he kept on getting 
back up and fending them off.

The New South Wales Ombudsman will oversee a police investigation into the death of the student, who was studying English in the Australian city.

Police today defended their use of stun guns.

Assistant Commissioner Malcom Lanyon said: ‘I think the community and the police rightly expect there is transparency in the use of Tasers and we welcome the Ombudsman’s role.’

He added that that the use of Taser guns was well regulated within the New South Wales police force.

But Andre Costa, the Brazilian consul in Sydney, has demanded an explanation for Mr Laudisio’s death.

He said: ‘The family wants to know exactly what happened to this young man who was so healthy and a good student.

‘He studied at a very good university in Brazil. He had friends here and family so he went out just for fun like any other young male on Saturday night and that happened to him.

‘The family cannot understand at all. They are desperate for information.’

Local MP David Shoebridge called for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr Laudisio’s death.

He said: ‘This is a thin veil of respectability over what, for all intent and purposes, remains an internal investigation with police investigating police.

‘We need the people who are asking the questions, taking the statements and checking with third-party witnesses to be genuinely independent of the NSW Police.’

Mr Laudisio was living with his sister in Sydney while he studied English.

His family Sao Paulo is today travelling to the city from Sao Paolo.
