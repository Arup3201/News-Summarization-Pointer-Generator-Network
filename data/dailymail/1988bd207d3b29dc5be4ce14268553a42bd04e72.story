Reduced rates: Terrorism Risk Insurance Act allows Federal Government to split the cost of insurance with the organizers of large events

There's a chance the Super Bowl won't be played this year because insurance used to cover the game is about to expire.

It all depends on whether or not Congress renews the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, however without any insurance, the game will almost certainly have to be cancelled. 

Terrorism insurance used to be widely available to U.S. businesses including the organizers of sporting events. 

TRIA was signed into law in 2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, establishing a risk-sharing partnership between the federal government and the insurance industry. 

Without federal support, most insurers had been unwilling to offer coverage. 

The act helps insure against terror attacks, and in recent weeks has been named a major concern for the organizers. 

The simplest way to understand the act is to know that it helps backstop private insurers who insure against damages from terrorism, making the rates lower for those who buy the insurance.

Although TRIA was renewed in 2005 and in 2007, it is set to expire on December 31 unless Congress renews it. 

With just two weeks to go before the deadline, the clock is ticking. Without insurance, a high-risk event like the Super Bowl cannot go on.

The play or not to play? The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is due to expire at the end of 2014 meaning the game may have to called off because the game will not be insured against acts of terrorism 

The NFL has joined other professional sports leagues and 80 business groups to form the Coalition to Insurance Against Terrorism (CIAT) to urge Congress to fund the reauthorization of TRIA. 

If TRIA is not renewed, insurers will have the right to cancel terrorism insurance policies after January 1.

Insurers are sometimes likely to cancel policies out of fear of insolvency, should another massive terrorist attack occur without government assistance. 

Prior to 9/11, insurers included terrorism coverage in all commercial policies without charging for it. 

The risk from terrorism was low and below their threshold level of concern. 

However, after shelling out $44 billion in claims for 9/1, insurers began to exclude terrorism from commercial policies. 

The TRIA act has to be reauthorized during the next two weeks otherwise insurers will have the right to cancel terrorism insurance policies after January 1st, putting the February 1st game in jeopardy.
