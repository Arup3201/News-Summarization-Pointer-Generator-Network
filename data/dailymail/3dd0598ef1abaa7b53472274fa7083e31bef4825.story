A babysitter has admitted to burning a toddler so badly during potty training that he was left with third degree burns and needed to learn how to walk again.

Mary Ann Garrett was in charge of Caden Collumns' care at her home daycare in El Dorado toddler in October when he was seriously injured. 

She originally told police the two-and-a-half year old had been burned by another child at her home, although she later confessed.

Caden was burnt with hot water from a removable shower head.

She is charged with one count of child abuse and one count of interference with law enforcement.

Butler County Sheriff Kelly Herzet says Garrett lied to detectives at the start of the investigation. 

'After she had done it and took the child to the hospital, she blamed her own granddaughter for doing it,' said the prosecutor, reports KWCH.

Garrett even made her three-year-old granddaughter spray Booth with the shower water, making the girl believe she was responsible, according to investigators.

Two months later, detectives brought Garrett back for further questioning and she confessed. 

Sheriff Kelly Herzet says Garrett ran an unlicensed daycare out of her home. 

He says she admitted to spraying Caden with scalding hot water from a detachable shower head during potty training.

'I think it had something to do with the child dirtying his diaper in his pants,' Herzet said to Kake. 

'And I don't know if it was her way of punishing or what she was trying to prove.

Caden spent a month in hospital recovering from extensive second and third degree burns on the front of his legs. 

'He was on really strong pain medications, was in so much pain, it was awful,' said Caden's grandmother Leah Booth.

He has now been released and is re-learning how to walk following his horrific injuries 

'He was on a feeding tube. He had no appetite, he just didn't want to eat.'

Caden's mother is a single mother and a Go Fund Me page has been set up to help her with the medical funds.
