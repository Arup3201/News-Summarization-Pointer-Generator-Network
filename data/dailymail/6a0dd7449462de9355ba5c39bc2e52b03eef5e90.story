The brutal rampage across Iraq by radical Sunni militia has led to an unlikely allegiance between the U.S. and Iran as they prepare for talks on the crisis.

The Obama administration has announced plans to open talks with Tehran this week to find a way to stop the the rapid spread of the ISIS - Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria.

The announcement came as shocking images emerged on Saturday, that appeared to show members of ISIS summarily executing about 1,400 men.

The images, which were posted on a militant website, allegedly show masked ISIS fighters forcing captives into a shallow ditch, as well as photos of what appeared to be bodies after they were shot.

Iraq's top military spokesman, Lieutenant General Qassim al-Moussawi confirmed the photos' authenticity on Sunday, although Western agencies have not yet said if they believe them to be real.

The shocking and rapid spread of violence across Iraq has led to the U.S. and Iran publicly announcing they will send military support if it is requested, the Wall Street Journal reported.

It is not clear how talks with Iran, which refers to the U.S. as the 'Great Satan', would take place, and other countries have expressed concern that any deal could damage negotiations on Tehran's nuclear program.

On Saturday, Iran's President Rouhani confirmed that he was willing to take part in talks and claimed to have had written correspondence with Obama.

'When
 the U.S. takes action, then one can think about cooperation. Until today, no specific 
request for help has been demanded. But we are ready to help within 
international law.'

The Obama administration is pushing 
for a coordinated response to the violence from Iran and other 
governments in the regions, and Secretary of State John Kerry has been 
in telephone talks with his Iraqi counterpart.

Security
 has also been increased at the 
U.S. embassy in Baghdad, after reports that about 1,200 ISIS fighters 
were marching towards the capital, after taking Mosul last week.

Many of the 5.500 staff who work in the embassy
complex have been airlifted to other regions, and the U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf.

Obama's plan to open talks with Tehran has been widely supported in Washington by both parties, with many saying ISIS was a threat to the national security.

'Why did we deal with Stalin? Because he was not as bad as Hitler. The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall,' Republican senator Lindsay Graham said.

An Iranian politician told the Wall 
Street Journal that the talks offered the chance for Tehran to improve 
relations with the West.

'Some of us realize that is the best 
opportunity for Iran to improve its diplomatic relations with the U.S.,' the politician, who requested anonymity, said.

Concerns have been raised that if the U.S. and Iran were drawn into a joint military strategy, their differing views on the future for Iraq could be problematic.

'This is a case where the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy. Any shared interests in Iraq are limited,' an American defense official said.
