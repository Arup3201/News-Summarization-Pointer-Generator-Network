Mark Sedwill has admitted that crucial files which could expose historical child sex abuse are likely to have been shredded

Explosive dossiers allegedly revealing the identities of a paedophile ring operating at Westminster have ‘probably been destroyed’, it was revealed last night.

The Home Office’s top mandarin Mark Sedwill has admitted that crucial files which could expose historical child sex abuse are likely to have been shredded.

On a day when the scandal at Westminster deepened, it also emerged that:

The late Mr Dickens planned to expose eight Establishment figures connected to child abuse. But it is now understood that there are likely to be more than eight names listed in the dossier – some of which are said to be ‘breathtaking’.

Last year Mr Sedwill, permanent secretary at the under-fire Home Office, led a review into his department’s handling of child abuse allegations between 1979 and 1999.

He discovered that 114 files which could have shed light on abuse – possibly involving high-ranking politicians – were missing, and four which named suspected paedophiles had never been passed to the police.

During a stormy session of the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday, he stressed that his review had failed to uncover any ‘sinister’ reason for their disappearance.

But he said the files had ‘probably’ been destroyed after two years, rather than lost, and so could never be recovered. 

He told MPs: ‘Most of these files were probably destroyed, because the kind of topics that they covered would have been subject to the normal file destruction procedures.’ 

Home Office advisers in the 1970s called for the age of consent to be lowered to 14  and sought to reduce punishment for so-called ‘consensual’ sex with girls as young as 12.

An internal document from 1979 reveals that officials wanted the age of consent lowered by two years from 16, and pressed for maximum life sentences to be reduced to no more than two years in cases of underage sex with 13-year-olds where ‘consent’ could be shown.

In cases of ‘younger offenders’, greater leniency would apply when the ‘consenting’ victim was 12. Today, sex with a 12-year-old can attract a life sentence.

Roy Walmsley and Karen White, the authors of the Home Office booklet entitled Sexual Offences, Consent and Sentencing, argued that many girls reach puberty before their 12th birthday and may initiate sex. 

In the booklet, obtained by The Guardian, the report’s authors state: ‘There is scope for amending the law to coincide with sentencing practice.

‘The higher penalties . . . could be available when victims/partners are under 13 (perhaps limiting them in the case of younger offenders to when girls involved are under 12).’

They add: ‘Paradoxical though it might seem to argue that [the point at which tougher sentences are applied] should be lower than the average age of puberty [13], it is not unreasonable . . . A large number of 12-year-old girls have already attained puberty and may not only be willing to take part in sexual activity but may actually initiate it.’

However despite Mr Sedwill’s suggestion that files had been shredded, a Labour MP last night made the explosive claim that the dossier had been ‘widely circulated’ around Whitehall – and is likely to have survived.

It has emerged that the ten-page dossier was copied and given to civil servants in other departments, all of whom had to sign the Official Secrets Act because of the seniority of the names it contained.

Today John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, will call for the OSA to be lifted for this item only, to enable potential whistleblowers with copies to bring it into the public domain.

Last night Mr Mann told the Mail: ‘There are multiple copies of that dossier which were circulated at the time across other departments. There was a meeting at the time in Whitehall where everyone had a copy.’

He added: ‘Without question, there are multiple copies out there. All it requires is for the Official Secrets Act to be lifted on this item in order for a copy to come forward.

'People will then know the evidence, and there are some breathtaking names.’

Meanwhile, MPs raised the prospect that MI5 could be storing copies of the dossier.

The Security Services are tasked with finding any information which could be used to blackmail MPs into giving up State secrets. 

MI5 is known to have a detailed file on the allegations against Liberal Democrat MP and notorious paedophile Cyril Smith, which was passed on by police.

Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘Files of a similar nature, which relate to the integrity of MPs, historically have been copied by the Security Services.’ 

Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May said that provided there was no threat to national security, the fresh probe – led by NSPCC chief Sir Peter Wanless – would be able to access intelligence held by MI5 and MI6.

And significantly the job of assisting Mr Wanless has been given to Official Secrets Act expert Richard Whittam QC, who has the highest possible level of security clearance. 

But the Home Secretary was yesterday criticised after it was revealed that Mr Sedwill had only shared the ‘broad conclusions’ of his review with her in June.

Labour’s home affairs spokesman Yvette Cooper said: ‘There are clearly big questions for the Home Secretary to answer. Neither she nor her senior official appear to have been briefed on its contents.’

Elizabeth Butler-Sloss will head the panel

Retired judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was yesterday appointed to head the panel investigating the establishment’s failure to protect children from abuse by paedophiles.

The 80-year-old will head a wide-ranging Hillsborough-style inquiry into historic abuses in Westminster, Whitehall, churches, children’s homes and elsewhere.

Baroness Butler-Sloss led the Cleveland child abuse inquiry in the late Eighties that led to more than 100 children being removed from their families.

More recently, she quit the inquest 
into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed, admitting 
she did not have sufficient experience of high-profile jury cases.

Mark
 Sedwill, permanent secretary at the Home Office, said she would not 
pursue individual cases of abuse, but insisted that her investigation 
would ‘leave no stone unturned’.

Lady
 Butler-Sloss will now appoint her panel and agree the terms of 
reference. However, the inquiry is not expected to report before the 
general election next May.

It
 does not have the power to compel witnesses to attend or take an oath, 
but Home Secretary Theresa May said it could be converted into a full 
public inquiry if necessary.
