Natalie James has launched an investigation into allegations employers are using a requirement of 417 visa holders to attract free labour

With millions of overseas workers expected to flood the labour market in the next five years, experts are concerned this will threaten the job prospects of Australians.

The Fair Work Ombudsman says an estimated 2.5 to 3.5 million foreigners will seek employment on Australian shores.

It comes as the workplace watchdog launches an investigation into allegations that overseas workers are being exploited by employers.

According to ombudsman Natalie James, it is believed local businesses are using the requirement that 417 visa holders must undertake 88 days of work to attract free labour.

With more than 128,000 of these working holiday visas issued in the first half of the 2013-14 financial year and the expectation this number is expected to increase, Ms James said it was important the integrity of the scheme be upheld.

But experts said schemes like the 417 visa could be used by employers as an opportunity to find cheaper labour costs.

University of Technology, Sydney's Sarah Kaine - a senior lecturer in human resources management - said there was a concern that visas used to attract foreign workers were undermining the current conditions and pay of Australian laws in relation to employment.

'Of course there are legitimate needs for a workforce where local workers can’t be found, like in agricultural areas such as fruit pickers, which is a phenomena we not only see in Australia but in the US,' she said.

'The problem is whether these workers are seen as cheap alternatives to Australian workers by employers, and that is where the danger lies with Australian workers.'

Ms Kaine also added foreign workers in industries that have no regulations surrounding employees' rights were most at risk of being exploited.

'It is at the lower end of the labour market where concerns are the greatest,' she said.

Experts are concerned the job prospects of Australians will be threatened by the millions of foreigners expected to hit our shores in the next five years

'They have less power to bargain and enforce those sorts of things.

'At least local workers know the local language but with foreign workers, compounded with regulatory issues and cultural issues, it is a recipe for disaster.'

During the past two financial years, the Fair Work Ombudsman has received about 2,000 requests for assistance from workers who are on 417 visas, which accounted for one in three requests from all visa holders.

Most of these requests came from those working in the hospitality industry - followed by agriculture, forestry and fishing.
