Andy Murray successfully negotiated his safe passage through to the second round at Wimbledon on Monday - just 24 hours after saving a labradoodle from being run over.

The defending champion spotted the dog, called Bode, sprinting towards traffic while he was out driving.

The 27-year-old got out of his car, caught Bode and took the dog into his car.

He rang the pet's owner, Mary-Elizabeth, using the phone number provided on Bode's collar and took the dog back to its home in Oxshott, Surrey, which is just a mile away from where Murray lives.

Murray began the defence of his Wimbledon crown by beating world number 105 David Goffin in straight sets on Monday to progress to the second round at the All England Club.

The Scot made light work of the 23-year-old Belgian, winning the match on Centre Court 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 in little more than two hours.

But, speaking after saving Bode from oncoming traffic, Murray said: 'The dog was pretty strong.

'I don't think it really wanted me to grab it by the collar. The owner was happy I'd picked it up.'

And owner Mary-Elizebeth was delighted with Murray's actions, labelling him a 'hero'.

She said: 'He is our hero. I'm absolutely a fan.

'What Andy did was lovely. It was absolutely amazing.'

Murray will face 23-year-old Slovenian Blaz Rola in the next round.
