A gym-obsessed father-of-two was found dead in his home just hours after he returned from a workout at the gym.

Fitness fanatic Andy Hultum, 36 from Hull, complained of feeling exhausted in the weeks before his death, and just hours after returning from Dales Fitness Centre in Hull, he suffered a fatal heart attack.

Father-of-two Andy, who was affectionately known as the Honey Monster on the Hull estate where he lived, was found dead in bed by his partner Marie, who rolled over in the morning to find he was lifeless.

Tragic Fitness fanatic Andy Hultum complained of feeling exhausted in the weeks before his death, and just hours after returning from a workout in the gym, he suffered a fatal heart attack

Andy had suffered a fatal heart attack in the night and unbeknown to his family, had been suffering with heart disease.

Andy’s father Michael, 64, said: 'Don’t leave anything to chance. No family should have to go through what we are going through.

'The last thing you should do is shrug your shoulders at something. Life is far too short if you take chances.

'Since Andy’s death, we’ve been told his arteries had flared up and he had a massive heart attack. We are absolutely devastated. It has ripped us apart.

'How do you drag a 20st muscular man kicking and screaming to the doctors? We wish we had now.'

Andy, who leaves his nine-year-old son Morgan and stepdaughter Georgia and his mother Sue, 59, said his children and the gym were his life.

Mother Sue, 59, said: 'You will have to go a long way to find someone who disliked Andy.

'He was a giant of a man in every single way. He has left a legacy in Bransholme because he was a role model - many have described him as a legend.

'Andy was the most beautiful son, inside and out. The gym and his beloved son Morgan were his life.

'He helped everyone he could and children on the estate looked up to him. I would urge all parents to never take time with their sons and daughters for granted because you never know when it will be cut short.

'We can’t believe we have outlived our little boy. He never went to the pub and was such a good honest lad. I couldn’t be prouder of him.'

A much-loved uncle, his young niece Amelia also wrote a moving tribute to Andy, starting with the words: ‘I wish you didn’t die’.

Councillor Anita Harrison, said: 'Everyone said Andy was one of the loveliest men anyone could meet. He would go out of his way to help and he will be greatly missed.'
