In the leafy avenues and boulevards of Brighton a very middle-class protest has erupted over the future of just one tree.

The old elm tree has stood in the same place for more than 170 years, surviving two world wars and the ravages of Dutch Elm Disease.

Ironically the threat to its future existence comes not from some private owner or property developer but from Britain’s first ever Green Party council.

Locals have started a protest as they oppose the destruction of a 170-year-ol elm tree in Brighton

The protesters have occupied the tree while posting messages and posters opposing the destruction of it

The council says the roots of the elm are causing major problems on the pavement and the road and is also posing difficulties for wheelchair users and prams.

And the local authority says the only way to solve the problem would be to fell the 60ft tree close to the Seven Dials roundabout.

The plan has caused uproar among the middle classes and trendy inhabitants of BN1 who have decided to occupy the tree.

Protesters clambered up the ancient elm while others have turned to a more artistic forms of expression to voice their opposition.

Poems, ribbons, pictures of weeping faces have all been pinned to the tree as part of the protest to stop the bulldozer moving in.

Tom Druitt, who owns the Big Lemon Bus Company in Brighton, is one of the protestors who climbed the tree to prevent the felling.

He said: ‘Most people in the area don’t want this going ahead. We will stay up here until they tell us they will not cut it down after all.’

The green party council say that the tree's roots are causing disruption for prams and wheelchair users on the pavement

The local Green MP Caroline Lucas has come down on the side of the protestors not the council

Another protester said: ‘This is a fairly organic protest, it hasn’t been strictly organised but local people feel so strongly about it they have just turned up to show their support.

Those protesting argue that tress makes up a vital part of the planet's eco system and should not be destroyed for petty reasons

‘We already have 5,000 signatures from locals and businesses showing their support. The elm is a healthy 60ft tree and I can’t see how it is in the way of their plans.’

The row has also led to a very public difference of opinion between Green MP Caroline Lucas and Brighton’s Green-administration leader Jason Kitcat.

The MP has come down on the side of the 
protesters saying: ‘I have been written to by many constituents who are 
deeply concerned that as part of plans for this area there are plans to 
remove this tree. It is very clear to me that this tree is hugely loved 
by many people who don’t want to see it come down.’

Brighton and Hove Council say the tree
would be felled as part of the improvement scheme but around 8 - 10 new
trees will be planted.

The council said: ‘It is causing increasing structural problems to the surrounding pavement and carriageway.

'The
tree is also causing the adjacent pavement to become very narrow and 
uneven which can cause problems for people in wheelchairs or with 
buggies, and there are concerns that visibility to the new zebra 
crossings will be obscured if it is left in place.’

Brighton and Hove Council say the scheme 
will improve the visual aspect of the area, the pedestrian environment 
and cycling infrastructure and the road design and layout.

The move has caused an uproar amongst Brighton's environmental population

Last night Geoff Raw, the council executive director, said: ‘We are listening to concerns and ensuring that the issues surrounding this project are fully understood.

‘Any matters raised will be carefully looked at by council officers. We are very much committed to working together with interested parties to move the scheme forward.’
