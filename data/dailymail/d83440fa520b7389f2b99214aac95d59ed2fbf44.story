Clichy was joined by partner Charlene Suric and his daughter, while Jesus Navas was with his wife Alejandra Moral and son Jesus Junior.

Kompany and Sagna had just returned to England following international duty with Belgium and France respectively, but Clichy and Navas have been enjoying a lengthy break after failing to make the squads French and Spanish squads for the recent Euro 2016 qualifiers.

All four will hope to be in action as the Premier League returns this weekend, with City facing Tottenham Hotspur at the Etihad in the lunchtime kick-off on Saturday.

And their encounters last season were less fairytale more horror story for Spurs.

They were thumped 6-0 at the Etihad Stadium last November, with Navas putting City ahead after just 14 seconds, before being thrashed 5-1 at White Hart Lane two months later in January.

Kompany and Co will be hoping for more of the same.
