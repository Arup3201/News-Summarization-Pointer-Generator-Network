A teenage rugby league player left paralysed after fracturing his spine was so determined to walk again he wasn't even phased when doctors told him he could spend his life in a wheelchair. 

Curtis Landers faced life as a quadriplegic after fracturing his c2 and c3 vertebrae carrying out a football tackle at Port Macquarie in northern NSW back in May.

Just three months after he was injured, the 15-year-old astounded doctors and physiotherapists when he walked out of hospital on his own two feet.

Now, Curtis can remarkably kick a football and play cricket - a feat his family never dreamed of when they saw him in a hospital bed a few months back.

Curtis Landers faced life as a quadriplegic after fracturing his spine during a football game in May. He astounded doctors when he walked out of hospital on his own two feet this month with his dad Kevin

Curtis, who was so determined to walk again, said he never entertained the idea that he may be confined to a wheelchair

'I was planning to play the season again so walking wasn’t a worry,' Curtis told 60 Minutes.

'I feel like a giant walking around… now I’ve got a second chance. It feels unreal.'

Curtis was airlifted to Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital immediately after the accident on May 24 to have spinal surgery.

He was carrying out a routine tackle during his under 15s game for his Forster-Tuncurry Hawks team.

'I just remember laying there and not being able to get up. If you get knocked down, the first thing is to get up back to your feet. I felt pins and needles. My mate said “Are you alright?” and I said “I don’t think I’m alright”,' Curtis said.

His mum, Marie Landers, said her son described his first leg movement just days after the accident as his 'party trick'

His parents, Kevin and Marie, said it was the worst news they could have imagined.

'It was like a bad dream… Just wanted to wake up and see it wasn’t real,' Mrs Landers said.

The image of Curtis paralysed in a hospital bed with tubes to help him breathe shocked his family and friends.

'I didn’t know when you broke your neck you couldn’t breathe and they told us about the tube and I said “How long will he have to have the tube for?” and (the doctor) said "could be two weeks, two months, two years or the rest of his life",' Mr Landers said.

Neurosurgeon Jonathon Ball carried out the surgery and said Curtis' recovery was 'inspirational'.

'A 15-year-old facing life as a quadriplegic in a wheelchair and we weren’t even sure if he would start breathing on his own. It’s about as bad as these situations get,' Dr Ball said.

'My gut feeling was this was a bad injury and the chances of him recovering at that point were very low. As a complete quadriplegic, the chances of walking again is less than 2 or 3 percent.

'I saw very little improvement the first few days, but on the fourth day I walked in… and (Curtis) flung his legs off the bed and started lifting his arms. I said s***.'

Mrs Landers said her son described his first leg movement just days after the accident as his 'party trick'.

Curtis was moved to Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney to undergo intense physiotherapy following his surgery at Royal North Shore Hospital

Curtis and his family have since returned to their home in Forster, north of Sydney, where he will continue his rehabilitation to ensure he can get by without a wheelchair

'He must have lied awake at night and tried different things. We couldn’t believe it,' she said.

Curtis was moved to Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney to undergo intense physiotherapy and step by step he learned to walk again.

'It is astonishing, it is inspirational. Across all operations there’s a handful of patients who I remember… (Curtis) is in the handful of patients who keep me doing what I do,' Dr Ball said.

Curtis and his family have since returned to their home in Forster, north of Sydney, where he will continue his rehabilitation to ensure he can get by without a wheelchair. He is now preparing to return to school.

Curtis also met with renowned NRL player Alex McKinnon in hospital and a photo of the pair in wheelchairs was posted to the Curtis Landers: Road To Recovery Facebook page.

The Knights forward was also in Royal North Shore undergoing treatment for a fractured c4 and c5 vertebrae he suffered in a tackle on March 24.
