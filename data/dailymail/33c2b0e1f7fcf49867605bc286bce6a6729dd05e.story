Luke Shaw and Phil Jones believe Manchester United's home fans can play a crucial role in helping their side get back to winning ways against Sunderland at the weekend.

The Red Devils duo are desperate to make amends for Manchester United's 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat against Swansea City in their last league outing.

Manchester United have lost just two games at Old Trafford this season - against Swansea and Southampton - and the England duo have put their consistent home form down to their strong fan base.

Shaw, speaking to Manchester United's official website, said: 'We always get that extra push at home from the fans and they've also been amazing away from home as well.

'At home it's always different - when teams come to Old Trafford they can feel that atmosphere and it can be a scary place for other teams. It’s a big pitch and United have always been strong at home and won a lot of games here so that’s a very important factor as well.

'I always look forward to playing every game but we’re especially looking to make sure we win this one. We’ve been working hard this week and it's massively important that we get the victory on Saturday.'

And Jones added: 'You have to stick together and get back on the training pitch and prepare well. That’s what we've been doing this week. It's an important game for us. 

'It won’t be easy, Sunderland are a tough team but we've done well at home recently and we need to bounce back from the defeat at the weekend. It’s never nice to lose a game. 

'We thought we played reasonably well, especially in the second half, but this will be another difficult match for us and one we need to win.' 

Both Shaw and Jones are expected to start against Sunderland at the weekend as Louis van Gaal's attempt to leapfrog fellow Champions League hopefuls Arsenal.
