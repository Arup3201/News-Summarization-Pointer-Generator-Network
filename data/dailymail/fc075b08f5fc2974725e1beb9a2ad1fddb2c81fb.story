Arsene Wenger did such a good job of turning Cesc Fabregas into an all-action box-to-box Premier League midfielder that he never really fitted back in at Barcelona when he went home in 2011.

The 27-year-old is now worth far more to an English club with aspirations of winning the Premier League than he is to Barca, desperate for a replacement for Xavi.

Fabregas will replace Frank Lampard with goals and energy in midfield far more effectively than he could replace Xavi as the pass-master of the Catalans' midfield.

Frustrated: Cesc Fabregas has found it hard to establish himself as a regular at Barcelona

The Spain star spent eight years at Arsenal where he signed as a 16-year-old and ended up as captain marvel in Wenger’s team. He thrived on the responsibility and the anarchy of so many top flight English games.

There was less responsibility given him at the Camp Nou and there are fewer end-to-end encounters to bring out the best in him. A Barca midfielder needs to pick his way through a 10-man defence more than he needs to take advantage of the space that an open game naturally creates.

Fabregas never shied away from admitting it was more of a culture shock to go home to Barcelona than it was to move to London at 16. 

When Barcelona bought him back they did so with the intention of making him the long-term replacement for Xavi but it was difficult to embrace that new role when Xavi’s continued presence in the team meant Fabregas often had to find a place elsewhere with another set of responsibilities.

Often in big games, especially in his second season, he did not play at all. 

Main man: Fabregas found it hard to dislodge Xavi and get into the Barca team

Regular: Andres Iniesta is another main player in the Catalan side's midfield

On his way: Frank Lampard will leave Chelsea after 13 years and countless trophies at Stamford Bridge

‘If you play one game, the next, and the next but then comes the big game away to Bayern Munich and we are losing 4-0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down,' he told Sportsmail at the start of the season when asked about the disappointment of missing out on Barca’s 2012-13 Champions League run.

‘It’s all about continuity. It’s more mental than anything else. Everyone knows Xavi and Iniesta are very good. I know what I can do, but sometimes you think, "Come on, give me a chance boss".'

Last season under Tata Martino it seemed he had become a first-team regular but Martino failed to land a trophy and fans were happy to blame Fabregas. He has always felt harshly judged by supporters who have perhaps never forgiven him for leaving as a teenager.

‘In England, you always have that extra bit of freedom as a player. You know that, if you misplace a pass, the fans are going to support you,’ he said. ‘And, in my case, it was a bit different because the supporters saw in me someone who had been at the club as a kid, left and then returned for a big fee.’

Coming of age: Fabregas grew up as a player and man at Arsenal and eventually became club captain

He has also struggled to come to terms with the demands of supporters sometimes not even happy when they win the league.

‘You win the league with 100 points and finish a record 15 points clear of Real Madrid but some people are not happy’ he said of Barcelona’s last trophy-winning campaign.

‘Barca are not just about winning leagues and lifting trophies. When we played Rayo Vallecano last season and won 4-0 people were not happy because they had slightly more possession than us. It’s incredible, it wasn’t as if we had won 1-0; we scored four!’

Those demands have taken their toll and as much as his heart will be heavy if ultimately he has to leave his boyhood club for the second time, he will know it will only help his career.

There were tears from his proud father Francesc the day he was presented back at Barca but the homecoming has not gone to plan and just maybe the truth is the Premier League was where he belonged all along.
