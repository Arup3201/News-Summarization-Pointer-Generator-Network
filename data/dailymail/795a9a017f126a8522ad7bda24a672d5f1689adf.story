Bailey's
parents brought their son, who had a concussion, to the A.I. DuPont 
hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was treated and released.

But his father Rob saw that something wasn’t quite right with their son when they returned home.

'He was sleeping. He was moody. He wasn’t himself. He was angry a little bit. He wasn’t really eating,' Mr O'Neil told ABC News.

Just a few days later, Bailey started having violent seizures and needed to be hospitalized again.

The seizures were so bad doctors at A.I. DuPont were forced to put Bailey in a medically induced coma nearly two weeks ago.

ABC News contacted A.I. DuPont Hospital the staff said they were unable to provide an update  on Bailey’s current condition because of privacy laws.

The school has turned the investigation over to local police and is cooperating fully with their efforts

'Every day I’m trying to stay strong for him,' Mr O'Neil said. 'When you get into that hospital room and you’re looking at him, I would trade places in a heartbeat.  It’s my buddy, you know.'

Southeast Delco School District Superintendent Stephen Butz said the school has turned the investigation over to local police and is cooperating fully with their efforts.

'We take bullying seriously,' he said.  'We are very concerned about the medical condition of the student and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and students.'

According to Bailey’s father, the boy who struck his son was suspended for two days following the incident, but police have not filed any criminal charges in the case.
