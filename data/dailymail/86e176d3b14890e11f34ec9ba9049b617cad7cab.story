The Prince of Wales and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, ended their second day in the U.S. with a glitzy night out with friends in Washington D.C.

The couple, who will celebrate their 10th anniversary next month, put on their best dress for a dinner hosted by Barby Allbritton, the head of the prince's charity in the U.S. and the widow of Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico.

The Allbrittons were so close to the British royals that they were two of a few Americans invited to the Royal Wedding between Charles' son Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.

Charles and Camilla joined Mrs Allbritton, her son Robert - who now runs Politico - and his wife Elena for the black tie charity affair on Wednesday night. The event was so secretive that other guests were only given the address earlier in the day, PageSix reported.

The night out came in the middle of the royal couple's four-day trip to the U.S., which is largely being spent in Washington D.C. before a trip to Louisville, Kentucky on Friday.

Charles and Camilla still look bright-eyed as they arrived at the party despite a whirlwind day  visiting D.C.'s landmarks and George Washington's plantation before delving into environmental policy.

At a meeting of the Global Ocean Commission and the International Sustainability Unit - a charitable group established by the prince to address environmental concerns - Charles spoke about the dangers of accumulating plastic waste in the world's oceans.

'Although the evidence surrounding the links between plastic waste and human health are not yet clear, I would tentatively suggest that they are unlikely to be beneficial,'he said during his 10-minute speech at the Hay Adams hotel.

Charles said that he was ‘haunted’ and ‘horrified’ by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations. 

Passionate: Following a day of sight-seeing on Wednesday, Prince Charles also attended an environmental event at the Hay Adams hotel, where he gave a 10-minute speech on the importance of recycling

‘Speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month’s time, I think we probably owe it to everyone else’s grandchildren to grasp that solution,’ he said.

His impassioned speech came after he and his wife took time out to play tourists.

On Wednesday morning, the couple wrapped up against the brisk temperatures for their 20-minute tour of the Martin Luther King memorial and paused to read his quotations engraved in the stone.

'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that,' read one quotation where the royal couple paused to see King's words from 1963.  

Harry Johnson, the president of the foundation that built the King memorial, said he gave the royal couple a stone from the memorial's granite as a gift.

The couple then visited the Lincoln Memorial, where they were greeted by historians.

During the visit, they were happy to chat with students on field trips.

Joan Darby, who brought her U.S. history class from Stafford, Virginia, to the King memorial said they were thrilled to meet Charles and Camilla, along with civil rights leaders Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis.

'To come here and have such a joyful event was just really incredible luck on our part,' she said.    

Camilla, who was showing off a chic new hairstyle, obligingly stopped for a selfie before continuing on with U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell by her side.

Charles and Camilla were then whisked off to Mount Vernon, where they were met by the Governor and First Lady of Virginia, Terry and Dorothy McAuliffe.

One of the most historic spots in the US, parts of the estate have been in the Washington family since the mid-17th century and it was at Mount Vernon that George Washington, the first president of the United States, lived.

Prince Charles, who arrived in the U.S. yesterday evening with his wife, also visited the National Archives today  to view the 1297 Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.

The document, a successor to the original 1209 charter, was reissued by Edward I as a quid pro quo for extra funds with which to wage war on Scotland.  

It was also on a tour of the National Archives that Charles learned his uncle once developed a new polo stick.  National Archivist David Ferriero presented the prince with a patent application submitted in 1931 by his uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, for a new kind of polo stick.

Charles, himself a polo player, laughed and said he had no idea that his uncle had designed a polo stick.

He also laughed when shown a telegram from the U.S. embassy in London to the Secretary of State, sent in 1957 seeking instructions to ensure that a toy car that had been given to Charles, then 8 years old, would be working properly when he returned home to play with it. Camilla, meanwhile, visited the Shakespeare Theatre Company.

The couple flew into the U.S. Tuesday night, arriving at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington DC on a private plane.

The royal tour has been welcomed by British ambassador Sir Peter Westmacott, who hopes the visit will give a boost to Anglo-American relations.

'I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together,' he said.

'Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.'  

Charles and Camilla will also visit Louisville in Kentucky.
