The harrowing 911 call made by passersby who found the jogging Australian baseball player as he was struggling to breath has been released hours after his girlfriend spoke out about how his killers deserve to 'rot in hell'.

The female caller spotted Chris Lane minutes after he was shot and called 911 but it took nearly seven minutes for emergency responders to arrive.

'He was standing in the roadway and he fell over and as I come by he just fell over in a ditch,' the woman, identified later as Joyce Smith, said to the 911 operator before describing how he was grasping for air.

The operator finally dispatches emergency services three minutes into the conversation, and minutes later the caller notes that the young athlete's breathing has become even more shallow.

'He's not conscious...I hear no sirens, I see no lights. Oh my gosh, how long is it going to be?'

About seven minutes after the call was placed, others have gathered to help the struggling victim while the woman remained on the line.

'Has he stopped breathing? Yes. Yes, they say he has. Finally here's some, finally here's some police,' she said.

Lane was formally pronounced dead at a nearby hospital nearly an hour after the shooting is thought to have occurred.

‘I
don’t really care what happens to them,’ Sarah Harper said following 
her boyfriend Chris Lane’s death on Friday in Duncan, Oklahoma.

‘I feel like if they don’t get what they deserve now and in the present, they will eternally. They’re just evil people.'

Harper, 23, met Lane, 22, when he came to America on a baseball scholarship and they have been dating for the past four years.

The couple had just returned from visiting his native country three days before he was shot during his daily jog.

‘Most people will go to college and try to find who they are on their own, like away from parents and all that but I found it with Chris and he really helped me,’ Ms Harper told Australia’s Herald Sun.

‘Luckily I got most of his time in the last four years…its helpful thinking back on those and not dwelling on all of this.

‘I talk to his family daily- whether its cousins, sisters or parents- and I wish that they find some kind of comfort to help them heal.’

In a Facebook post about her boyfriend's death, Ms Harper wrote that their time together had been 'the most amazing of my life'.

'I love you so much babe. From 2009 until forever you will always be mine and in a very special and protected place in my heart.'

'It's a very angry yet extremely sad time. No one deserves to die that way. Not even the boys involved.

'Don't get me wrong, I want them to rot in hell, but no one should be blindly taken from the back so unexpectedly and without any reason.'

Not all Australians are being supportive like Lane’s family, as former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called for his fellow countrymen to think of this shooting when they are planning a trip to the United States.

'People (who) are thinking of going to the USA on business, vacation, trips, should think carefully about it given the statistical facts you are 15 times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Australia per capita per million people,' he told CNN's Piers Morgan.

'Just for the record, Australia has had zero gun massacres since 1996, and in the United States, 80 people are killed by guns every single day.

'So, it is another example of murder and mayhem on Main Street.'

For America's part, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did not comment on any specific action.

'This is clearly a tragic death, and we extend our condolences to the family and the loved ones. We understand that local authorities are focused on bringing those responsible to justice. Clearly, we would support that,' she said at a briefing on Tuesday.

The three teens accused in the murder- James Edwards, 15, and Chancey Luna, 16, who are charged with first degree murder and Michael Jones, 17, who is charged as an accessory for driving the getaway car- are all being held on bail.

District Attorney Jason Hicks told the press inside the Oklahoma courthouse that he is 'going to do everything I can to ensure these three thugs pay for what they did to Christopher Lane'.

Though all three are being tried as adults and a first degree murder charge in Oklahoma can come with a death penalty, they will not face the prospect of execution because of their age.

‘I don't want them to have any future that Chris wasn't able to have as well,’ Ms Harper said, according to The Herald Sun.

‘It's been pretty rough. It's been hard knowing he was taken so close to home, let alone taken in the way he was. To be pointed out like that.’

Ms Harper said that unbeknownst to her, Lane’s family had started raising funds to pay for her flight back to Australia so that she could attend his funeral.

‘I appreciate everything that they've done and I appreciate them sharing him over here with all of us- me in particular,’ she said.
