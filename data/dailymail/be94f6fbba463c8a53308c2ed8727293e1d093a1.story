Perhaps Newcastle’s players will be docked wages for this brazen disregard of club policy?

For how dare they ignore the Magpie mandate - We Do Not Prioritise Cup Competitions – and do so in front of a live television audience?

These were the understudies, supposed to exit stage left and allow the leading men to concentrate on the cash cow that is the Premier League. A cup run, after all, is a distraction.

But the black-and-white boys did not read the script. Instead, they defied the odds, the odds which pitched a starting XI worth £20million against the strength of a City side valued at 10 times that meagre amount.

And do not forget, this was a Newcastle team which included Ryan Taylor, a player making his first appearance in 26 months and admirably making it through the 90 minutes. He was, in fact, man-of-the-match.

‘He was outstanding,’ said Alan Pardew. ‘He got a special round of applause when he came in the dressing-room afterwards and our players love him.

‘But all of the players were magnificent and we thoroughly deserved that victory.’

Taylor had a hand in the opening goal, robbing Fernandinho to set free the brilliant Rolando Aarons who did the rest with a cool finish. He also inflicted the injury which unsettled City, his inadvertent trod on David Silva ending the Spaniard’s evening after just nine minutes.

But there was nothing accidental about Newcastle’s valiant display. Aarons – returning from a six-week hamstring layoff – was a menace during the opening 45 minutes in which he outshone the likes of Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri. And this from an 18-year-old making only his second senior start.

Daryl Janmaat, meanwhile, has only been on Tyneside since July but, speaking before the game, he mentioned the club’s 45-year wait for a trophy – we take it he didn’t pick that up from a Pardew team-talk, for six changes reinforced Newcastle’s Premier priority.

The manager, though, has to play politician and, had he named his strongest XI, it would not have been to the liking of his paymasters.

But his understudies are now just two games from the biggest stage of all, how dare they…
