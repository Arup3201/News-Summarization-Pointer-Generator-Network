The smells of sun cream, fish and chips, and candyfloss are among the most powerful aromas that can transport us back to holidays of our past, according to a new survey.

A study of 2000 people has unearthed the 40 most evocative scents that trigger memories of childhood, school days and family trips to sunny destinations.

A British favourite: The smell of fish and chips is powerfully redolent of seaside holidays

And, in a sign that many of us gaze back fondly to sepia afternoons at fairgrounds in British seaside resorts like Blackpool, Bognor or Skegness, the smell of hot sugar and gaudy colourings that is a stick of candyfloss has emerged as a hugely potent throwback.

Other aromas that convey us back to long-ago holidays include the batter and grease of traditional fish and chips (ideally eaten out of old newspaper), sun lotion and bubble gum – the latter being redolent of trips to the sweet shop with pocket money to spend.

The research was commissioned by Disneyland Paris to mark the launch of its new ride Ratatouille – The Adventure, in July.

Sensory expert Professor Barry Smith, of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says that smell is the most emotive of the five senses.

‘More than any other sense, smell can evoke powerful, emotional memories,’ he says.

‘Whole scenes of people, places and things can be brought back to life by the mere hint of a long forgotten scent.

Drifting back through the years: Smell is the most powerful of the senses for triggering memories of past times

‘The rooms in a friend’s house, a boat trip, the sound of a voice – all can be conjured up by a smell’s power to reproduce the scenes for us.’

‘Whether it’s a seaside holiday, a visit to a fairground or a sunny walk through a forest,’ he continues, ‘suddenly smelling a particular scent can take us right back there, re-creating the whole sensory experience.’

Other aromas to carry us back to earlier days include freshly mown grass (indicative of school sports days), bonfires (long winter nights) and popcorn (trips to the cinema).

Our receptiveness to smells also varies according to location and gender.

The survey shows that people in Northern Ireland are most responsive to aromas that conjure memories of people and places.

And women are shown to be 20 per cent more likely than men to recall distant memories from a trigger scent.
