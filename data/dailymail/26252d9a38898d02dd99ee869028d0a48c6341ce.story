A supermarket cashier who smacked a toddler for misbehaving in her store has been sacked, it emerged last night.

The Morrisons employee left four-year-old Max Johnson inconsolable after she slapped the back of his legs.

His mother Selina, 26, had nipped into her local supermarket near Chorley, Lancashire, and was paying at the till when Max started acting up.

Outraged: Selina Johnson, with her son Max, aged four, who was slapped on the legs by an unnamed Morrisons employee who has now been fired

She reprimanded him for throwing a plastic carrier bag on the floor, but when he refused to pick it up the older female cashier warned him that she would slap his legs if he did not do as he was told.

To Miss Johnson’s horror, the unnamed worker, in her 50s, got up from her seat and carried out her threat.

Police were called and questioned the woman, but she escaped any formal action after apologising. 

She was suspended by bosses but yesterday Morrisons confirmed she was ‘no longer an employee’ following a disciplinary hearing.

Miss Johnson said after the incident earlier this month: ‘I was totally shocked.

Accusation: The post by Selina Johnson which was circulated locally on Facebook

‘I never thought she would really do it.

'I didn’t see how hard the smack was, but Max screamed straight away and was crying his eyes out.’

A post about the encounter was circulated widely in the area on Facebook.

The message by Miss Johnson
 said: 'Today I had the worst experience any parent could have. Today one
 of your staff smacked my four-year-old’s legs.

'My poor little boy cried his heart out.

'I have complained to the store manager and called the police who will be taking a statement and we will be pressing charges.

'I will never set foot in on one of your stores again.'

The message was posted publicly to Morrisons, which has more than 300,000 fans on Facebook.
