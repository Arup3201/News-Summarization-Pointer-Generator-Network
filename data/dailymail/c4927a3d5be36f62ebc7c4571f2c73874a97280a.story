Ms Yang posed as globetrotting Interpol agent 'Mr Li' in order to con various middle-aged single women out of money and possesions

A 54-year old Chinese woman conned victims out of thousands by claiming she was a 'superhuman' male police officer who could turn himself invisible. 

The con-woman, identified only as Ms Yang, duped her victims out of at least £12,000 by pretending to be 'Mr Li', an officer of Interpol and member of the Chinese Ministry of Finance with superhuman powers.

According to the Telegraph, she would use this alter-ego to seduce people she met on a forum for middle-aged singles, before stealing from them.

When Ms Yang became short on cash in early 2013, she allegedly faked documents to access and post on the internet forum, where she posed as 'Mr Li' a senior communist party official.

She would identify her marks, chat with them, and establish the lie that she was a superhuman police officer.

Her first victim was Ms Zhang, a 48-year-old woman who began a relationship with 'Mr Li' in March 2013, and by June, the couple had moved in together.

Ms Zhang, who was, according to the Beijing News 'quite suspicious' was allegedly utterly taken in by the lies.

The lie was continued to the point that Ms Yang would cut her hair short and deepen her voice when telling stories to Ms Zhang about how she (as Mr Li) had cracked 'major' interpol cases using his superhuman powers.

The thievery began when 'Mr Li' claimed he had lost his wallet and needed money to 'recieve international friends'.

Ms
 Zhang lent her partner around £11,800 (120,000 yuan) under the guise 
that Mr Li would repay her, and that the money would 'help him do things
 for the country'.

Ms Yang's fabricated character 'Mr Li' more closely resembled a comic book character like Susan Storm (The Invisible Woman) than a real-life Interpol agent, but she still managed to con thousands out of her marks

The debt was never settled, and in August 'Mr Li' vanished from Ms Zhang's life.

When Ms Zhang, heartbroken, went to look for 'Mr Li' at the Ministry of Finance, she was told that he did not exist.

'Mr Li' then moved on to another person, conning a mark, a 52-year-old woman named Ms Song, out of a laptop computer.

A third victim, a pensioner, was conned out of £400.

Her cover was eventually blown when her first lover, Ms Zhang, approached the police looking for 'Mr Li', beofre being told that 'Mr Li never existed, and was actually a 54-year-old woman.

Ms Yang had previously spent 11 years in jail for fraud, and will not go on trial for the second time.
