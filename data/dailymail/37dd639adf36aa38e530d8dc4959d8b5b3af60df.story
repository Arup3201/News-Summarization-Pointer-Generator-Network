On trial: Jessica Cruz, pictured upon her arrest aged 19, is charged with murdering her newborn son

A woman accused of murdering her newborn son has admitted to wrapping the baby in a plastic bag and dumping him in a trash can.

Jessica Cruz, of Streamwood, Illinois, is pleading not guilty to the murder of her baby boy in a Salvation Army store in 2011.

Cruz, who was 19 at the time, told police she panicked after giving birth in the shop's bathroom because her mother, from whom she had been hiding her pregnancy, was waiting outside.

Employees at the Salvation Army store in Streamwood found the 6lbs 11oz baby dead in the trash, wrapped in a plastic bag.

A videotape where Cruz admits killing the baby was played to the jury in Cook County's Rolling Meadows branch court on Wednesday.

During the hour-long interview filmed shortly after her 2011 arrest, Cruz repeatedly mentions the fear of her mother finding out about the pregnancy. 

When a policeman asks Cruz if the baby was still alive when it was born, she replies 'I think so'.

When asked if she took the boy's life, she replies, 'Yes, but I don't remember tying him up like that.'

Assistant Public Defender Dan Naranjo told the court earlier that the baby because it was stillborn, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Cruz walked into the Salvation Army store around 10am on November 4, 2011, and asked to use the bathroom.

Witnesses said they saw Cruz leaving the bathroom covered in blood about an hour after she walked in.

The cause of death of the baby boy was ruled as homicide by strangulation. It is believed the boy suffered a neck haemorrhage.

Cruz told police she had not told anyone she was pregnant except for the boy's father, even though she lived with her mother through the pregnancy.

'I didn't want to tell (my mother about the pregnancy) because she had told me I had done a lot of bad things to her,' Cruz said in the videotape, according to the Chicago Tribune.

'I don't want to give her any more grief. She's given me everything.'

Cruz, who has been held without bond since her arrest on November 8, 2011, is charged with murder and concealment of a homicide.

If found guilty, the 22-year-old, who has a young daughter from before her arrest, could face life in prison.
