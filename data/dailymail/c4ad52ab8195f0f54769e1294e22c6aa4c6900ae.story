Doctor Who fans in Britain were today fearful that the secret plot of Saturday's finale could be revealed by U.S. viewers - after discs of the latest series were sent out early by mistake.

A ‘small number’ of fans in America were sent their pre-ordered Blu-rays three weeks early, BBC Worldwide said, as it urged those with the discs to avoid posting details of what happens online.

Producers promised they would release a special video after the final episode, starring current Doctor Matt Smith and his predecessor David Tennant - but only ‘if everyone keeps the secret’.

‘A small number of U.S. Doctor Who 
fans have received their Series Seven Part Two DVD three weeks early,’ a
BBC Worldwide spokesman said, adding that it was investigating why this
happened.

Excited Doctor Who fans who couldn't wait to book tickets to this year's BBC Proms 2013 were left bitterly disappointed after the website crashed.

This year's event will feature two special performances of music from the popular sci-fi drama in a nod to its 50th anniversary.

A stampede of Doctor Who enthusiasts were blamed for the crash which eventually saw 114,000 tickets being sold since booking opened on Saturday - an increase of 17 per cent on last year.

Even touts had a look in, with some now craftily charging more than ten times their value as fans eagerly try to snap up tickets. Some touts were selling them for more than £1,000 each, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Some visitors to the booking website were given error messages or their purchases simply terminated. Others who tried buying tickets on the phone reported to being kept on the line for hours.

The BBC has said that its Prom's director Roger Wright described the record-breaking sales as a 'thrill.'

‘We are asking 
fans who may have the discs not to divulge plot details so that fellow 
fans who have yet to see the episodes do not have their viewing pleasure
ruined.’

The
Name Of The Doctor - the hotly-anticipated episode due to be shown on 
Saturday on BBC One, written by producer Steven Moffat - follows Nightmare In Silver, which was broadcast last Saturday.

Some
fans have already speculated - without having seen it - that the 
episode could reveal the Doctor’s real name, and it is expected to 
conclude a number of major long-running storylines.

A 50th anniversary 3D special of the hit drama is due to be shown on November 23, with Tennant - who featured in Doctor Who from 2005 to 2010 - and his former companion Billie Piper also starring.

Moffatt criticised people who ‘call themselves fans’ in May 2011 after plot lines were revealed before the episodes aired, telling BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘You can imagine how much I hate them.’

A Doctor Who spokesman said on Twitter last night: 'Some U.S. DVDs of this series have gone out early. The Doctor Who team would be hugely grateful if fans helped keep spoilers off the net.

'Steven Moffat has promised if fans help keep the finale’s secrets, we’ll release a special video featuring Matt (Smith) & David (Tennant) right after the ep(isode).’
