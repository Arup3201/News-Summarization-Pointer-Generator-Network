It is the ultimate is personalised toys - a dancing 'bobblehead' that looks exactly like you.

Amazon today launched a new 3d printing service that allows customers to design toys to look like themselves - and is also giving people the change to design their own jewellry.

Most of the more than 200 items available on the company's new 3D printed products store, which launched on Monday, can be customized using a new feature that allows users to rotate and change the item they are viewing.

But your own mini-me: Amazon has begun selling the $30 3D printed toys as part of a new 3D printed goods store

Each Mixee Bobbler is 3D printed on demand in full color using a proprietary powder specifically formulated for this color 3D printing.

Leftover powder is reused so there is less material waste than with traditional manufacturing.

The spring is 3D printed with laser sintered nylon plastic.

A print head binds the powder together layer by layer with glue.

Other print heads follow and add color to the powder layer.

After all the layers are done, the solidified model is extracted from the tray and any excess powder is removed.

A sealant is then applied to brighten the color and protect the model.

Before it is printed by one of Amazon's sellers, users can customize a product like as a bobble head figure by changing its skin and eye color, hair style and outfit, Amazon said.

'The introduction of our 3D Printed Products store suggests the beginnings of a shift in online retail - that manufacturing can be more nimble to provide an immersive customer experience.

'Sellers, in alignment with designers and manufacturers, can offer more dynamic inventory for customers to personalize and truly make their own,' said Petra Schindler-Carter, Director for Amazon Marketplace Sales.

'The 3D Printed Products store allows us to help sellers, designers and manufacturers reach millions of customers while providing a fun and creative customer experience to personalize a potentially infinite number of products at great prices across many product categories.'

The bobblehead toys are provided by Mixee.

'At just 2-3 inches tall, these little guys are the perfect addition to your desk decor or mantel,' it says.

'2d portraits are so last decade.

'Make cute cartoon figurines of yourself, friends, family, and coworkers.'

Even the character's clothing can be customised as part of the process

At just 3 inches tall, the figure's material 'feels like unglazed ceramics'. The surface texture is slightly sandy, like fine dry coral or sandstone.

These custom 3d-printed figurines are made with 3d-printed full color sandstone, a matte material that feels like unglazed ceramics.

Amazon, which has more than 240 million users, has expanded its marketplaces division to include new areas such as fine art and wine.

It is part of Amazon's larger investment into new areas like mobile services and original content that led to its larger-than-expected second-quarter loss last week.

The new printing option taps into a broader 'Maker movement' among tech entrepreneurs in northern California, and to some extent Europe, that is focused on customizing 3D objects rather than development software or mobile applications.

3D printers have gained in popularity on Amazon Supply, a wholesale site for businesses.

That interest led Amazon to offer customers an 3D print option, Schindler-Carter said.
