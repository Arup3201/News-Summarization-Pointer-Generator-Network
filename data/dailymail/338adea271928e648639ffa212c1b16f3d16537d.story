David Crespi plead guilty to brutally stabbing his five-year-old twin daughters to death, but there is one person that still believes he's innocent: their mother.

Kimberli Crespi has fought for her husband from the beginning, forgiving him for his horrific crime in 2006 and now she wants to share their story with the world.

Mrs Crespi believes Crespi killed their girls because he was misdiagnosed with a personality disorder and put on a cocktail of drugs which in turn, caused a psychotic episode.

Treatment, not prison, is the answer, she says.

Family: Kimberli Crespi, right, has fought for her husband, left, from the

'We live for them, we live for their sweetness, we long for them, but the reality is they're not in this life,' Mrs Crespi said to WBTV.

Tessara Kate Crespi and Samantha Joy Crespi were born to David and Kimberli on October 17, 2000 in Sacramento, California. They would have turned 12 years old this month.

Tessa's favorite color was purple and she loved to dance. Sammie loved lambs, pink poodles and her favorite color was blue.

They were two of five children in the Crespi family when they moved to North Carolina.

Then on January 20, 2006, David Crespi killed them in a violent outburst: stabbing them 32 times. A knife was found stuck in the body of one of them.

David Crespi called 911 and was arrested at the scene. In order to avoid the death penalty, he plead guilty to both their deaths and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in July of 2006.

Mrs Crespi makes sure to visit him every week.

Missing: Treatment, not prison, is the answer, she says. Her family has been punished by being deprived of David has made their loss even worse

'I can’t believe it,' she told the Charlotte Observer of her husband’s imprisonment.

'When I visit, I’m like, "How could David Crespi be in prison?" He’s a good person. For him to do this is unbelievable. He was such a good dad. But it happened.'

'It's horrible, it's absolutely horrible 
what happened to Tess and Sam and to David but it's just easier for 
society to leave him in prison and act like that and walk away.'Kimberli Crespi

Mrs Crespi says that a cocktail of newly prescribed drugs, which included Ambien, Trazadone, Prozac and Lunesta.

She believes a chemical imbalance caused the crime, not Crespi's actions.

'It wouldn't have happened without the prescriptions. David Crespi never acted like this ever in his life,' said Mrs Crespi to WSOCTV.

However, Marsha Goodenow, the chief homicide prosecutor, said that Crespi testified he had violent thoughts before he ever began taking the pills.

'He was asked, "Did you have these thoughts when you were on the medication or off the medication," and he said "both,"' she told 20/20 in an earlier interview.

'You can't say that someone who would do this to their own daughters isn’t sick. Obviously he's sick, but sickness does not excuse criminal behavior.'

Mrs Crespi said she still mourns her little girls, but being deprived of her husband has caused even more pain. The couple has been married 16 years.

'He should not be punished. He didn’t have free will at the time when he did this,' she told the Charlotte Observer.

Together: The casket containing the remains of Samantha and Tessara Crespi is wheeled to an awaiting hearse after funeral services at St. Matthew Catholic Church on Tuesday afternoon, Jan 24, 2006, in Charlotte, N.C.

She has become a champion of anti-depressant awareness, trying to educate others about the dangers of medications.

David Crespi has since been weened off all pills, Mrs Crespi said. He's 'back to his old self.'

'David is a lovely person who one day did something horrible, and I would like that to not happen to somebody else. If it happened to us, I think it can happen to anybody,' she said.

She is leading a lecture on the side effects of antidepressants on Thursday, October 11 at the South Charlotte Banquet Center.

'It's horrible, it's absolutely horrible what happened to Tess and Sam and to David but it's just easier for society to leave him in prison and act like that and walk away,' she said. to WBTV.
