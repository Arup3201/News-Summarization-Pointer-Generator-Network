Eighteen months ago, Conor McGregor arrived in Boston as a one-fight UFC novice.

He left a bona fide star - albeit a limping one after the Dubliner tore his cruciate ligament in his knee during his victory over Max Holloway.

On Sunday, he will clamber into the same Octagon against veteran German Dennis Siver, knowing he is just one win away from a title shot.

'Now I'm on taxis and billboards and the sides of buses out here so that's one thing that's changed,' McGregor told Sportsmail.

'I'm getting noticed a lot more in America. The fan base here seems to be growing at a rapid pace.

'If I step back and look at the journey I've been on and I see how far I've come, I just enjoy it.

'In my imagination, I always had everything but now it's transforming into reality. It's becoming more difficult to figure out the difference between imagination and reality, they appear to be one and the same.'

After almost a year on the sidelines, McGregor returned last summer  with successive first round stoppages of first Diego Brandao and then Dustin Poirier.

McGregor then dispatched Dustin Poirier in equally stunning fashion in the first round in Las Vegas 

'I came back from a career threatening injury and things have been going so well for me,' McGregor added.

'I'm taken aback every day by it but I control it, embrace it and I move on. Everything has gone smoothly; I focus on what goes right and everything else will go right.'

McGregor, 26, has been outspoken about his next opponent, particularly in regard to Siver's failed drug test last April for which he was slapped with a nine-month ban.'

'I could easily have sat out and waited for mid-summer and fought for the belt,' McGregor said. 'But as a man who loves competition, I asked for a fight.

'I am not the person who picks the opponent at the end of the day. He [Siver] was in the frame before the Dustin fight even took place.

'After that I was the No 1 contender, I did not have to compete again.  

McGregor has shown little respect to Siver (right) ahead of their main event clash at the TD Garden 

'They went down the line of the top featherweights, everyone else had been matched but Dennis hadn't.

'I do not think he deserves it but he got lucky. When the door shuts and the bell rings, his luck will run out.'

McGregor has long predicted a stoppage within two minutes on Sunday, a result that would lead to an early summer clash with featherweight champion Jose Aldo, possibly in front of 80,000 fans at Croke Park in Dublin. 

'Anytime I can bring the UFC back to Ireland, it is motivation for me,' he added. 'It will be a historic event to fight for the title on home soil.'
