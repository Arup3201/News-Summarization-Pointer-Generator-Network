A DNA match has led New York Police Department cold-case investigators to solve the 22-year-old murder of a young mother, who was strangled and stabbed to death in The Bronx.

Police on Friday arrested 46-year-old Johnathan Jolivert in connection to the March 1993 slaying of 21-year-old Michelle Page, who was the mother of his baby son.

Page was discovered dead in her apartment in the 1200 block of Morris Avenue on the afternoon of March 24, 1993.

Case cracked: Police arrested Johnathan Jolivert, 46 (left), in the 1993 murder of the mother of his young son, 21-year-old Michelle Page, after a DNA sample matched to the suspect 

She had a scarf wrapped around her neck and had been stabbed. The woman's naked body was found by her mother lying in a hallway with a kitchen knife protruding from her throat.

According to prosecutors, Jolivert visited Page's home on the day of the murder to give her child support money, reported PIX11.

The couple's 14-month-old son was not home when Ms Page, a business student at Manhattan Community College, was killed.

NYPD's cold-case squad made the arrest after resubmitting for testing a DNA sample found under Michelle Page's fingernails.

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has determined that the crime scene evidence matched Johnathan Jolivert's DNA.

Jolivert, a homeless man from Brooklyn, was taken into custody without incident at around 6.15pm February 13 at a drug treatment facility in Carmel, New York. He has pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge.

There is no word at this time on a possible motive behind the grisly killing.

Records cited by DNAInfo.com show that the 46-year-old murder suspect has a lengthy criminal history, which includes more than 20 prior arrests dating back to 2002 on charges ranging from possession of stolen property to criminal contempt and grand larceny.

At his arraignment Saturday, a judge ordered Jolivert held without bail.
