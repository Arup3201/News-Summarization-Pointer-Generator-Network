A YouGov poll found that 70 per cent of Labour voters believe Ed Miliband is not fit to become prime minister

After being deemed 'too ugly' to become prime minister, Ed Miliband has been dealt another blow after it was revealed that 70 per cent of people don't believe in him.

The YouGov poll gives him his worst rating since winning the Labour leadership and a sure sign that supporters are turning away from him.

The shedding of support continued today after a blogger and Labour activist started trending on Twitter when he posted an article about why he recently switched allegiance to the Conservatives.

Luke Bozier, a party member for five years, wrote: 'At a time when the nation needs strong political leadership, Labour offers nothing.

The poll carried out for the Sunday Times showed that fewer Labour voters believe Mr Miliband is performing well compared to those who think he is doing a job.

He received an overall rating of -3 points compared to David Cameron's 91 and Nick Clegg's 45 from Lib Dems.

Further rubbing salt into the wounds, most people said they believe his elder brother, David, would do a better job but he has ruled out standing again.

An MP was quoted by the newspaper as saying: '[David Miliband] said fratricide is one thing, double fratricide is quite another. It would destroy the party and [the brothers'] relationship.'

He has the right policies, and and also looks and sounds like a possible Prime Minister: 16%

He has the right policies, but does NOT look or sound like a possible prime minister: 59%

His policies are wrong, but he looks and sounds like a possible Prime Minister: 5%

His policies are wrong, and he does NOT look or sound [like] a possible Prime Minister: 11%

Don't know: 9%

Alistair Darling is the second choice for Labour voters pushing Miliband into third place with just seven per cent saying he is the best person to lead the party.

Shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has been touted as the favourite candidate for the job if Miliband is replaced by the time of the next election in spring 2015.

Last week it was suggested by John Humphrys that Ed Miliband did not look right for the job of PM to which he replied 'I don't accept that'.

However, only 10 per cent of people said they thought that Miliband was 'too ugly' for the job.

The prospect of a leadership election has been ruled out at this stage, however, with some of his harshest critics saying it is too early, instead believing autumn 2013 to be the best time for change.

Embattled Ed Miliband was told by Labour MPs on Saturday night to stop copying David Cameron and start showing some leadership of his own.

The Labour leader sparked a furious backlash after the party abandoned opposition to the Coalition's public-sector pay freeze and refused to reverse cuts.

The U-turn was unveiled by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who insisted the party had to set a 'credible' alternative to the Coalition and be 'honest with the British people'.

But Labour MPs accused the two Eds of caving into the Tory agenda.

Labour veteran Austin Mitchell attacked 'barmy' Mr Balls's cuts somersaults and also lambasted 'weak' Mr Miliband.

He told The Mail on Sunday: 'This is a desperate attempt to get respectability but it's barmy.

Miliband is acting out of weakness. We are not the Government and we will get nowhere by going around wearing a hair shirt like this.'

The poll was carried out just days after Miliband underwent a relaunch to answer those who doubted his abilities as leader.

In a scathing attack on the Labour party, Mr Bozier writes in his blog that Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls were 'out-of-touch', Brownite career politicians.

He criticises the wider party saying it has been taken over by student politicians and is unable to 'put aside its tribal prejudice and ideology'.

He writes: 'Ed Miliband is a leader that Labour MPs and Labour members didn't want. He was forced upon them by the Trade Unions and like most people, I wasn't happy with the result.

'I tried for as long as I could to give Ed the benefit of the doubt. But look what it's come to, with the party and the leader now a national laughing stock.

'Rarely in British history has a leader become so quickly defined by humiliating questions about his looks and personality.

On his new allegiance to the Tory's, Mr Bozier said: 'David Cameron, sensing the intellectual and political paralysis throughout the Labour Party, has picked up New Labour's baton of reform and is running with it.

'Cameron's Conservatives have again become the party of the aspirational classes.'

He concludes: 'But the Labour Party - which has comfortably turned back into Old Labour - no longer speaks for this country.

'And it no longer speaks for me and the sort of Britain I want for my children. And that is why, today, I am joining the Conservatives.'
