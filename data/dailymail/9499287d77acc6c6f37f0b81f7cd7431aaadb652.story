Police tipped off about a cannabis factory in a flat were beaten to the crime scene by a group of teenagers who broke in to take the plants.

Neighbours in Hove, East Sussex, alerted officers twice when they spotted a 'strange' light coming from inside the property.

In the meantime, four teenagers also spotted the suspicious light coming from the flat and decided to break in and take the cannabis plants they found inside themselves.

Too late: Police scour the cannabis factory for clues - but only after it was raided by teenagers

Pauline Herbert, 62, who lives on the ground floor, said: 'I phone the police up on Saturday morning as I noticed something in the flat above me.

'There were all these strange lights, at first I thought it was on fire. There were some youngsters hanging around sat on a wall outside.

'I told them to move on but they stayed and the neighbours opposite told me when I went out they used my front bay window as a step to get to the flat upstairs.

'They forced the upstairs window open and I have debris all over my garden and window. Apparently they then stole about three of the big cannabis plants.

'By the time I came home later one of the neighbours was outside picking up the leaves from the street. The police hadn't arrived so I rang them again and told them what had happened.

'Within a few minutes there were three cars and three police vans, it was like a circus. They were here searching the house until half 11 at night.'

Mrs Herbert added: 'It has obviously been up there a while as there has been a strange smell in my flat.

'I thought it was my cat doing her business in the house but now I know it was upstairs. I have been feeling a lot better in myself since the weekend and that is probably why.

'What we think happened is that there was a blind or shield up at the window which must have fallen down which is why everyone's attention was drawn to the lighting in the flat.

'It has caused quite a stir here.'

Another neighbour who did not want to be named said: 'There were four boys hanging around on Saturday afternoon, they couldn't have been older than 14.

'They broke into one of the flats and stole some of the cannabis plants. They created a human chain down the side of the house to pass the plants down safely. These plants were big things. The boys were last seen fleeing up the road.'

A Sussex police spokesperson said: 'Police were called to a flat in Hove, on Saturday, March 9, at 2.30pm after reports of bright lights coming from the property.

'Around 40 cannabis plants were found growing inside the flat and these were seized. The premises were made safe by the electricity board. Police would like to speak to any witnesses before they arrived at the flat.'
