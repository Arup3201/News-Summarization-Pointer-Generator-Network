Wayne Rooney led a spirited England fightback on his 100th appearance for his country and hailed it as a night he would remember for the rest of his life.

Rooney, presented with a golden cap by Sir Bobby Charlton before kick off as his wife Coleen and two young sons Kai and Klay looked on, won and scored England's vital equalising penalty after a Jordan Henderson own goal had given underdogs Slovenia a shock lead at Wembley.

Danny Welbeck then scored twice to earn England a 3-1 win and maintain their 100 per cent record in Euro 2016 Group E qualification.

The Manchester United striker, now only five goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time England scoring record, said: 'It is a great feeling. It was a big week, a big build-up and a great occasion.

'I was really proud to walk out at Wembley as captain of England with my two boys. It is something I will remember for the rest of my life.

'It was tough because they took the lead and we had to show our character. But that will be good for us as a team. Since the World Cup we haven't seen that. After they went ahead we really woke up and showed what a good team we are.'

On winning the penalty when he dribbled into the Slovenian area, Rooney added: 'I was trying to get myself a yard to get a shot away and the lad clipped my heels. It was a clear penalty and great we got the goal so soon after they scored.'

His enthusiastic manager Roy Hodgson, who made Rooney skipper earlier this season after the international retirement of Steven Gerrard, said: 'It was a wonderful evening for him. It must have been special for him to have his cap presented by Sir Bobby Charlton. And then he capped a good performance by scoring that first goal.

'He is very important to me as England manager but also very important for English football. It was very fitting he got his rewards on a night when so much was about him.

'I am sure he is delighted. He has taken the captaincy extremely seriously, and put all his energy and enthusiasm and passion into it.'

Rooney's wife Coleen was among those in the Wembley crowd who stood up to applaud his 44th goal for England which now places him joint-third with Jimmy Greaves on England's all-time scoring list and closing in on Sir Bobby.

The Manchester United striker smashed his penalty past Inter Milan goalkeeper Samir Handanovic – who had saved his previous five spot-kicks - after being tripped by Bostjan Cesar, two minutes after Henderson had headed into his own net.

Once level, England found it relatively easy to go on after a poor first half and win the match with a double from Danny Welbeck after 66 and 72 minutes. They are now overwhelming favourites to qualify for Euro 2016.

Hodgson, who said it would be “churlish” to criticise his players for their first-half showing, praised Welbeck whose £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal has coincided with some red-hot form in an England shirt. 

The England boss said: 'I have always believed in Danny Welbeck. He was a surprise selection to many people at Euro 2012 and I don't think there has been one squad in which Danny wasn't there, even at times when he wasn't getting a regular game for his club. 

'I am just pleased that everyone is recognising his talent. He is doing the business on the field.' 

Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne impressed on his England debut at right back and could keep his place for the friendly against Scotland on Tuesday. Hodgson has however released first-choice goalkeeper Joe Hart for the game to give understudies Ben Foster and Fraser Forster a chance to play at Celtic Park. Forster was a Celtic player until the summer when he signed for Southampton.
