He's a key Manchester City player and England's first-choice goalkeeper so footballer Joe Hart knows a thing or two about success.

That's exactly why Hugo Boss has snapped up the successful young athlete to front their new scent, which is inspired by 'man’s determination and drive for success.'

While the 27-year-old is known for keeping the most clean sheets in the Premier League's season - that's preventing the opponents scoring any goals during an entire match - he also looks set to take the modelling world by storm, if this new campaign is anything to go by.

New face: England goalkeeper Joe Hart, who has become something of a heartthrob on the pitch, has been unveiled as the face of Hugo Boss' new fragrance

Speaking to MailOnline about becoming the face of Boss Bottled Unlimited, he said: 'I spend a lot of the time not smelling good on the pitch so this campaign is great because, after all, I do like to smell good and this scent is really invigorating and aromatic.

'As for the modelling, it definitely isn't something I am used to but I got to wear some really cool clothes.'

Joe, who describes his personal style as 'comfy, fresh, sharp and tidy,'  joins Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Reynolds as a face of the beauty giant. 'He's a cool guy and luckily I'm not filling his shoes,' he said.

While his fellow footballers are more assiduous when it comes to grooming (here's looking at you, David Beckham), Joe maintains that his beauty regime is very simple.

'I do like to look after myself but I promise my hair colour is natural!' he said of those famous blonde locks.

As a master of his profession, Joe shared his views on success, how to achieve it and how to sustain it.

He said: 'To succeed, you have to be committed to what you do and love what you do. I’m really passionate about my job and give it my all.

'I’m so lucky that I’ve always had a team around me that have helped me get to where I am today - family, friends, and coaches. You have to take every opportunity possible and you just have to keep going, keep improving and constantly moving forward.'

Speaking about his diet and getting in shape for summer, Joe explained that, while he has a healthy eating regime, he is partial to the odd treat.

'I eat well and at the right times and obviously do loads of exercise and training, which I really enjoy.

'My diet is high protein and I avoid carbs in the evening but I don't neglect food, it's my friend.

'I have treat days and anything goes, I'll pretty much eat anything and everything,' he said.

When he isn't training or impressing on the pitch, Joe loves to play even more sport.

'I love chilling out with friends and family, I am obviously a football fan and love to watch and play sports such as golf and cricket.'

But you won't catch him playing FIFA or football manager in his downtime.

'I am rubbish at football games,' he laughs. 'Level one is too hard for me!.'
