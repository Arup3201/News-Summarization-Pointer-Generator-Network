The Deputy Prime Minister wrote the Lib Dems would push for a 'daddy month' if elected again for new fathers to enjoy time off 

A ‘Daddy Month’ plan to boost new fathers’ rights to paternity leave was promised by Nick Clegg last night.

The Deputy Prime Minister wants to increase statutory paid paternity leave from two weeks to four.

The pledge came as Mr Clegg lashed out at ‘dinosaur’ critics who opposed his call last week to let fathers share mothers’ parental leave to look after a new child.

In an article for the Mumsnet website last night, the Liberal Democrat leader confirmed that he wanted to double new fathers’ current entitlement of up to two weeks – worth about £138 a week from the state. 

Mr Clegg wrote: ‘In Government again, the Lib Dems would introduce a "daddy month" – a new, additional use-it-or-lose-it block of time for new dads to stay at home.

‘We know more men want to be more involved with their children at home.’

The vow comes after Mr Clegg came under fire last week for calling for private employers to copy a new Civil Service scheme which, from next year, will let fathers share the far more generous paid time off currently available for new mothers.

Mr Clegg’s call sparked concern from business leaders who warned company bosses would not welcome new rules on paid paternity and maternity leave.

But last night, the Deputy Prime Minister insisted he had never suggested saddling firms with more costs – stressing that as couples would share their parental leave entitlement, there would be no extra cost to employers.

‘For every day a man spends at home, a woman will be back at work – so what’s the problem?’ he asked.

Mr Clegg accused his critics of actually saying that while companies can afford to lose a woman for a few months, they could not put up with losing a man for that long.

He added: ‘What utter rubbish – a sorry glimpse into the dated misogyny that still stalks part of the British Establishment.

‘It feels ridiculous for me even to write that women are as valuable to their employers as their male counterparts.

‘Of course they are. And yet it seems the flamingly obvious still needs to be said.’
