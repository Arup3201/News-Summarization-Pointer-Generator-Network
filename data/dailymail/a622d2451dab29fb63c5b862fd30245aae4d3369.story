Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is accused of abuse of office and paying 17-year-old prostitute for sex

Silvio Berlusconi told girls coming to his house for a bunga bunga party that he wanted a 'calmer evening' as the night before he had been he had been 'mad for it.'

The former Italian prime minister, 75, was taped as he spoke to Marystell Polanco, 31, and Aris Espinosa, 22, after they telephoned him and asked if they could 'come and visit him tonight' with two other women.

The conversations form part of more than 50,000 calls that were taped by prosecutors as part of the ongoing bunga bunga trial in which the politician is accused of paying a minor for sex.

It was posted on the website of 
Italian newspaper La Repubblica and opens with Aris talking to 
Berlusconi and calling him in a cooing voice 'my little puppy,' before 
asking if she had disturbed him, with Berlusconi telling her: 'I had 
some important meetings but I have dealt with them. They are all 
finished. How can I help you.'

After
some small talk she passes the receiver to Marystell who says: 'Hi - 
did you get the message yesterday that I couldn't make it?' To which 
Berlusconi answers jokingly: 'Yes - they told me you didn't give a f*** 
about me and that you had other more important and interesting things to
do, more sexually exciting.'

Marystell
then adds laughing that she will be coming along that evening to 
Berlusconi's home with the girls including sultry Venezuela beauty queen
Aida Yespica, 29, the former girlfriend of singer Craig David.

Berlusconi
is heard saying: 'Tell Aida though that tonight won't be anything 
special - last night we were all mad for it. I am shattered. So tonight 
we will have a tranquil dinner and listen to some music, I don't want to
be the main player.'

Prosecutors say that in total 33 women were regular guests at the parties Berlusconi threw at his villa in Arcore near Milan between September 2010 and May 2011 and they were paid with cash, jewellery and cars.

Witnesses have told the hearing in Milan that women dressed as nuns or wore AC Milan football shirts, before performing sultry stripteases and pole dances for Berlusconi as he looked on in the basement of the villa.

The charges against Berlusconi relate to Karima Keyek, nicknamed Ruby, who was 17 at the time of the alleged offences

Among those who attended was belly dancer Karima El Mahroug, who also goes by the name Ruby the Heartstealer and who was just 17 at the time and therefore a minor.

In Italy the legal age of consent is 14 but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as prostitution with a minor, although both she and Berlusconi insist that nothing untoward happened.

The conversation with Marystell would also appear to be at odds with another defence made by Berlusconi, who quit as prime minister in November last year, that '33 girls is too many for any man'.

In an interview last year when the allegations first surfaced he said: '... even though I am a bit of a mischievous... 33 girls in two months is too many, even for a thirty year old. It's too many for anybody.'

While in another conversation Berlusconi tells Marystell that Aris is 'naughty, naughty naughty' before she passes the telephone to Aris who tells Berlusconi that he is the 'very, very, very naughty one'.

He then says: 'I am in a very tough war but when I win it I will take advantage of your sweet beautiful lips.'

The bunga bunga trial is due to resume on May 7 Friday. The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman under 18 is seen as child prostitution and besides this allegation Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office with prosecutors claiming he tried to cover up for Miss El Mahroug when she was arrested on a theft charge.

He is said to have knowingly and wrongly told police in Milan two years ago, that the teenager was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and should be freed so as to avoid a diplomatic incident.

The sex charge carries a maximum sentence of three years while abuse of office is punishable with 12 years in jail.

The trial started last year and is not expected to finish until 2013 at the earliest with hundreds of witnesses due to testify including George Clooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.
