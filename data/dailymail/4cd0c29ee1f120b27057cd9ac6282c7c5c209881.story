Friends and family of a Denver woman are enraged that a pastor cancelled her funeral services after they were scheduled to begin over his objection to a same-sex kiss in the memorial video.

Vanessa Collier died on December 30, and her family paid the New Hope Ministries $400 to have her funeral service there on January 10.

Then, at 10:15am, 15 minutes after the service was supposed to begin, the family was told they could no longer move forward as the family refused to remove a kiss between Collier, a lesbian, and her wife in the memorial video.

Collier, 33, also had two daughters, Kylee M. Bounthavilay and Maddison G. Morris.

The funeral service for Vanessa Collier (left with wife Christina Higley) was cancelled on Saturday 15 minutes after they were scheduled to have begun

The pastor said he would not move forward because of a kiss between Collier and her wife (above) that was featured in the memorial video

This after the family had already paid New Hope ministries (above) and been seated for the service

'I am a child of a lesbian mother and if my mom was to die, I would want dignity in her death,' Collier's friend Jose Silva told ABC 7.

'I am against bigotry and stand with my friend Vanessa Collier's family in seeking an apology and refund from Pastor Ray Chavez and New Hope Ministries. The acts that took place at her funeral were wrong and no family should ever have to go through that.'

Pastor Ray Chavez, the man who cancelled the services, has refused to comment.

As a result, pallbearers were forced to moved the woman's body and casket to a nearby funeral homes that was able to provide a venue for the service at the last second. 

What's more, the family said the ministry had the videos that day before, but did not review them until the morning of the service.

They did however refund the family's money

'We don't want overt, open homosexuality in our sanctuary,' said Gary Rolando, a pastor at New Hope Ministries.

'I am a child of a lesbian mother and if my mom was to die, I would want dignity in her death,' said Collier's friend Jose Silva as protesters gathered on Tuesday (above)

'You will not find Jesus at New Hope but you will find HYPOCRISY,' said one sign (above) at the protest

'As a result, it was a very difficult day,' he added. 

'We had to call the pall bearers… it was a logistical nightmare, but was handled as professionally as I've ever seen.'

On Tuesday, friends and family of Collier were back at new Hope Ministries protesting the events that happened over the weekend. 

'You will not find Jesus at New Hope but you will find HYPOCRISY,' said one.

Said Rolando, 'New Hope is very sorry. It's very sad that it happened the way that it did.'
