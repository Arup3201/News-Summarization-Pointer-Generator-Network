Marks & Spencer is to stop opening new general stores in the UK amid a shift to internet shopping.

The company will build four new large outlets over the next three years, but then call a halt to 129 years of bricks and mortar expansion.

Bosses believe that the popularity of 'click and collect' means people will be buying more online and either collecting from its existing stores or getting home deliveries.

The firm, which was started in 1884, has opened on average six stores every year in a race to reach as much of the UK population as possible.

As a result it now has some 766 UK outlets, including 419 of its specialist Simply Food convenience stores.

But in a sign of the times. the chief executive Marc Bolland said booming sales online mean that the M&S store network will have reached saturation and there will be no more new clothing stores.

'The number of net new stores will be flat due to the growth of dotcom within three years,' he said.

'This means that we will continue to maintain the estate by closing some of the older stores and replacing them with new ones in better locations, but we will not be growing our general merchandise chain in the UK.'

The move is in tune with a shift by John Lewis, the big supermarkets and others, which are scaling back plans for new large bricks and mortar outlets.

Britain leads the world in terms of internet shopping, with a greater share and value of spending than any other nation, including the U.S..

However, the other side of that equation is that national chains no longer need a store in every town centre.

The proposals by M&S, which will continue to open small Simply Food outlets, emerged as the company yesterday revealed a six per cent fall in profits.

Profits for the last financial year were £665.2million - taking them well below the £1billion plus made as recently as 2008.

Mr Bolland admitted its fashions 'have not been good enough', but he said a new Winter/Autumn collection has been well received.

Despite losing market share to budget rivals such as Primark, Marks & Spencer remains the UK's biggest clothing retailer.

Asked about the poor performance in fashion, Mr Bolland admitted: 'It's been not good enough but still we have got the largest business in the UK by far.'

He said M&S is beating rivals on quality and is now aiming 'to bring something that really delights and surprises the customer'.

He added: 'Secondly, it's about style. We can bring improved style, more trends to customers than we have done so far and where we have done that in our womenswear it has really helped.'

The company is pinning its hopes of a revival on a new upmarket Autumn and Winter collection devised by the former boss at Debenhams and Jaeger, Belinda Earl.

The fashion press has welcomed the range, although analysts fear some of the lines will be too expensive for its core customers.

The womenswear collection includes a British-made wool double-breasted coat at £349.

A new 'Best of British' line in menswear includes a grey windowpane check single-breasted wool suit at £799 and handmade double monk strap leather shoes at £285.

While the company's recent record on clothing and general merchandise has been poor, M&S has largely been rescued by the success of its food.

Figures published yesterday showed underlying sales of general merchandise in 2012/13, including clothes, were down by 4.1 per cent, while food was up by 1.7 per cent.

Once, the impact of new stores, overseas and internet sales were added to the equation, total sales were up by 1.3 per cent. Despite this small increase, underlying profits fell from £687.2million to £665.2million.

City analysts were not surprised by the bad news and suggested the pressure is on Mr Bolland to deliver an improvement or move on.

John Ibbotson, director of consultants Retail Vision, complained: 'M&S seems like a rabbit in the headlights. However many operational improvements it makes, it's all immaterial unless the retailer can rediscover its panache.'
