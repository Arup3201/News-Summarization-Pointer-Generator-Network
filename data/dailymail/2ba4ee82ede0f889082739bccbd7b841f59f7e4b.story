Daniel Craig left Kate Moss a voicemail message declaring his love for her, a court heard today.

Former News of the World reporter Dan Evans told the Old Bailey he intercepted a message from Mr Craig while working at the Sunday Mirror.

The message said, 'I love you, I love you, I love you,' the court was told.

Mr Craig and supermodel Ms Moss were widely rumoured to be dating for a few months in 2004, but never publicly confirmed the relationship.

Message: Daniel Craig told Kate Moss 'I love you' in a voicemail listened to by a Sunday Mirror reporter, a court heard; the pair are pictured together at an Alexander McQueen fashion show in June 2004

The court also heard that Jude Law was 
'mistaken' in saying he never left a 'threatening' voicemail for Mr 
Craig when he learned the Bond star was having an affair with his 
then-girlfriend Sienna Miller.

Evans insisted a line in a draft story 
quoting Mr Law as saying 'Worry about your own girlfriend, pal' was a 
paraphrase of what he told Mr Craig in the angry phone message that he 
hacked.

On Monday, Mr Law 
told the Old Bailey trial he confronted his long-time friend over the 
phone from Baltimore, but did not leave him a voicemail.

Questioned
 about the discrepancy, Evans said: 'I would say Mr Law is mistaken. Is 
it beyond the realms of possibility he left a voicemail and Daniel Craig
 rang him back? He did. I heard it, hence why you have got that quote in
 the story.'

He said the 
'threatening message' on the voicemail saying 'Hey mate, hope Saskie [Mr
 Craig's then girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell] does not find out' had 
'inspired' the quote he later wrote for the newspaper.

Later
 in today's hearing, Evans admitted fiddling his expenses by claiming a 
meal with his partner involved a 'Daniel Craig contact', adding: 'It was
 part of our culture at the paper but I don't see what it's got to do 
with hacking phones.'

On the stand: Evans give evidence under cross-examination from Timothy Langdale QC as Coulson looks on

Affair: Another hacked message apparently revealed that Sienna Miller was in a relationship with Mr Craig, her co-star in 2004 film Layer Cake

Evans, who has pleaded guilty to hacking
 at the News of the World, claims Andy Coulson, then editor of the 
tabloid, knew about his activities and endorsed stories based on hacked 
messages.

On his fifth day in the witness box at the Old Bailey, Evans was being cross-examined by Coulson's lawyer, Timothy Langdale QC.

The
 court heard that Evans has already admitted conspiracy to hack phones 
at both the Sunday Mirror and the News of the World between 2003 and 2010.

Coulson
 is on trial charged with conspiring to hack phones and conspiring to 
commit misconduct in a public office, alongside former Sun and NotW 
editor Rebekah Brooks and five others.

All seven defendants deny all the charges against them.

The trial heard from a series of emails 
between staff at the NotW, including Coulson, discussing information 
which two sources close to Mr Law had given to another journalist.

Transcripts from interviews read to the court exposed information from the sources described as One and Two.

Witness: Jude Law - Ms Miller's boyfriend at the time - gave evidence in the case this week

Source One told the NotW that he first saw Ms Miller with Mr Craig at the London restaurant, The Ivy, and Miller was 'panicking' that the press would make something out of it.

The second time, Source One said they were at a house in Notting Hill. Mr Craig left and drove off while Ms Miller hid behind the door, the court heard.

Source Two told the NotW that Ms Miller was just 'keeping Jude dangling' while 'going onto her next victim'.

Source Two claimed that Ms Miller was 'clingy' and a bit of a 'stalker' so would call both Mr Law and Mr Craig several times an hour.

The source said: 'They [Ms Miller and Ms Craig] are constantly on the phone with each other. She is always texting and ringing.'

The source asked a NotW journalist if he had access to their phones, and the response was 'No, no, no, that would be illegal,' Mr Langdale said.

Source Two told the NotW journalist that Ms Miller had moved out and 'fled the country', adding: 'She not a nice girl, she's not a goody two shoes.'

The source went on to suggest that Mr Law wanted the story about the split back-dated to look like Ms Miller 'cheated first'.

Mr Langdale put it to Evans that the information in his story about the cheating couple came from these two sources, not a voicemail, but the witness disagreed.
