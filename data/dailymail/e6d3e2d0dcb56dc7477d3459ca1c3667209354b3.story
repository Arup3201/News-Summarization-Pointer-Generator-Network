A teen video blogger who has courted controversy by saying that domestic abuse is a sign of love has been told that her logic is 'flawed at so many levels.'

Romina Garcia, 18, appeared on Dr Phil's show in response to a video she posted online last year. 

In the video, which has been viewed more than five million times, Romina told viewers not many boyfriends 'care enough' to beat their girlfriends but those are 'willing' to do so are 'amazing'.

In a video she uploaded last year, Romina Garcia (pictured) urged girls to stay with their abusive boyfriends

During a talk with Dr Phil (right) on his show, Romina said that a boyfriend risking jail time over domestic abuse charges was a sign of love and that 'not anyone is just going to go to jail for you'

Romina, of Las Vegas, Nevada, added: 'I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you, like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does, stay with him. 

'[He] loves you because he's risking for you to press charges on him, he is risking for you know, you calling the police.

'He's gonna do time or he's gonna have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be. 

'He's risking all of that for you.'

During her appearance on the show, Romina told Dr Phil she suffered a backlash after posting the video and that she is misunderstood. 

She mentioned she received messages of support and understanding as well and feels she is a role model for her 153,000 fans and followers.

Dr Phil questioned her belief that a boyfriend risking jail time over abuse charges was a positive.

He said: 'Your theory is that because they're willing to put themselves at risk of going to jail, paying fines, whatever, that you must mean an awful lot to them, or they wouldn't put themselves in harm's way for you and therefore, you must really be loved?'

She replied: 'Exactly. Not anyone is just going to go to jail for you. 

'You know, they're investing time and money, and it's just a lot. So, like, he must really care.

'I really do believe that.'

The video was met with  criticism online (pictured) and Romina told Dr Phil that she felt misunderstood 

After he let Romina have her say and defend her reasoning, Dr Phil told the teen: 'Your logic is flawed at so many levels.'

He continued: 'I am very concerned that the idiotic message that you're putting out there could cause an innocent young girl to put herself in harm's way following that logic and get herself hurt.

'I think what you're saying is irresponsible. I think it is ridiculous. Somebody needs to tell you straight up what's wrong with what you're saying.' 

Dr Phil isn't the only one who is critical of Romina's message. 

The 'Unfollow And Destroy Romina Garcia' page was created on Facebook for the purpose of exposing Romina and 'her awful posts and statuses'.

Following Romina's appearance on the show, the page creator wrote: 'Not only is what she's saying dangerous, but it's completely disgusting that she thinks domestic violence is a joke and a way to get attention.

'Let's stop her and the violence against young women all together.'

Another user wrote that Romina was more affected by appearing on the show than she let on:

'Romina honey without sounding rude you need to understand that someone hitting you doesn't mean they love you. 

'Your eyes showed u know this is wrong by the tears u were holding in. 

'I truly hope u see a different side now u have heard how wrong this is from millions of people.' 

The full transcript of the shocking video uploaded by Romina Garcia on her Facebook page. 

Okay you guys, I wanted to address something, mainly with you girls, about your boyfriend or the guy you're talking to and I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does. Stay with him. 

That n***** f****** loves you because he's risking for you to press charges on him, he is risking for you know, you calling the police or you know, he - he's gonna do time or he's gonna have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be, he's risking all of that for you. So that n***** f****** loves you!

And you need to get on your f****** knees and just pray and hope that he doesn't give you another black-eye or he doesn't kill you.

Because honestly, like, a guy that's willing to do that for a girl, it's - I mean, it's amazing, like, not many guys you have out there care enough for the girls to do that. But the guys that do that they're the real like the real ass n***** and you - you girls need to appreciate it.

And you know the other day my boyfriend gave me a black-eye, it was my fault, like, he didn't mean - I mean he, he - he was going to hit me but like I moved, so he got my eye. 

'Like, he hit me in my eye whatever, he gave me a black-eye. But I'm wearing make-up right now so you can't tell but it's on this eye. I was going to go out somewhere today so he took me to get my make-up done because he didn't want people seeing me with him, you know, because I had a black-eye, they were gonna be like 'what f***', you know. 

'Or whatever, he just didn't like that or whatever. So I went to go get my makeup done but the fact that he put his hands on me means a lot to me because that shows me how he cares.

'And as you asked like he hit me, like, after I realized how stupid I was, how I could have avoided everything, I got on my knees and I begged him like please 'do not leave me', like, I am so sorry for what I, you know, for what I did.

'Like, you gave me an order and I didn't follow it and now I know not to disrespect you, not to talk back, if he gives me an order to follow it and I know you b*****s are gonna be like, well where's your proof, well you know well my proof of like my black-eye, I took a picture of it, it's on my Instagram and my Instagram is romina-kdashian so you can always follow me on there.

'And I just wanna let ya'll know that you need to appreciate your man and if he hits you - stay with him. He f****** loves you.
