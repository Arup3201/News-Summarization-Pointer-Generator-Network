An on-line community of Republic of Ireland football fans believe the FAI has ‘systematic flaws’ in how it allocates tickets for senior internationals.

Members of YBIG.ie have reacted angrily to the ‘large number of regular travellers who have had their ticket applications rejected for the upcoming (Euro 2016) qualifier against Scotland.’

The FAI received 3,000 tickets for the Group D game in Glasgow on November 14 which was never enough to cope with more than 10,000 applications.

In a statement, YBIG.ie claim that the majority of the 400 fans who travelled to Georgia last month were turned down for a ticket, along with season ticket holders with a near 100 per cent away attendance for the last two campaigns.

Their statement read: 'This is not the first time that the Irish support has expressed serious concerns over the methodology for the allocation of tickets for key away games. 

'In previous meetings between the FAI and site members, detailed proposals were presented for an away ticketing scheme. These was rejected by the FAI, who assured representatives that a robust system would be implemented. We are disappointed to note that this game has shown that this is clearly not the case.' 

The FAI were unavailable for comment.
