Matthew Wade has been named in Australia's 13-man one-day international squad for the first time in almost a year as he covers for the rested Brad Haddin in next month's series against South Africa.

The 26-year-old Victorian wicketkeeper has not played an ODI since January when he was part of Australia's five-run win over England in Adelaide, but returns for the first two matches of the series when the two top-ranked teams pit their wits against one another.

Australia will host South Africa in Perth on November 14 and 16 before the series moves to Canberra on November 19 and culminates with matches in Melbourne (November 21) and Sydney (November 23).

With the opening two games at the pace-friendly WACA in Perth, Australia have named six fast bowlers - Mitchell Johnson, Josh Hazlewood, Kane Richardson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, plus all-rounders Shane Watson and Mitch Marsh.

'This squad caters for the WACA's renowned fast and bouncy surface with six pace bowling options,' national selector Rod Marsh said.

'Nathan Coulter-Nile has returned from injury after missing the Zimbabwe tour and - along with Josh Hazlewood - finished in the top three wicket-takers in the Matador Cup [the domestic 50-over competition].'
