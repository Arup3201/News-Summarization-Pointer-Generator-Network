The former bank boss caught buying crystal meth and crack cocaine has been suspended from the Labour party as Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring him as an advisor.

Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister who was chairman of the Co-operative Bank when it ran into trouble, now faces an investigation by the police after being covertly filmed counting off £20 notes to buy hard drugs.

Today the Co-operative Group has launched a fact-finding investigation into 'any inappropriate behaviour' at the group or the Co-operative Bank and a 'root-and-branch review' of the structure of the organisation.

Caught on camera: The Rev Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for a drugs deal

Until June Flowers was £132,000-a-year chairman of the ‘ethical’ bank, which has lent £34million to Labour over two decades.

The Labour party today moved to distance itself from Flowers, suspending the former city councillor for bringing the party into ‘disrepute’.

At the weekend he apologised ‘to all I have hurt or failed by my actions’ over the revelations in the Mail on Sunday involving crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine.

He bragged of getting ‘wasted’ following his grilling by MPs over the near-collapse of the bank.

As the scale of the Co-Op Bank’s financial problems emerged this year, Flowers stepped down as chairman and as deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group.

The bank lost £700million in the first six months of the year and a £1.5billion black hole was discovered in its finances. 

As well as being suspended by the Labour Party, he has also been suspended by the Methodist Church.

Now the Co-op Group has launched an inquiry into any 'inappropriate behaviour' at the bank or the wider group.

The Co-operative group said in a statement: 'Given the serious and wide-ranging nature of recent allegations, the new executive management team has started a fact-finding process to look into any inappropriate behaviour at the Co-operative Group or the Co-operative Bank and to take action as necessary.

'In addition, the board of the Co-operative Group has launched a root and branch review of the democratic structure of the organisation.

'We need to modernise to ensure that the interests of all our seven million members are properly and directly represented in the oversight of our business activities.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband defended hiring Flowers to advise him on finance and industry

It is embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who in 2010 appointed Flowers as a member of Labour’s influential finance and industry advisory board.

Flowers has been a Methodist minister for almost 40 years and served as a Labour councillor on Bradford City Council, where he lives, for a decade.

Today Mr Miliband defended bringing Flowers into the party fold: ‘He was involved in the Co-op and that is no longer the case. I think we will leave it there.

‘You appoint people from a whole range of backgrounds to look at a whole range of issues and we have a range of business people working with us.

‘The police are looking into the matter and I'm not going to comment on an ongoing investigation.’

A Labour spokesman added: ‘In the light of recent reports, we have today suspended Paul Flowers as a member of the Labour Party for bringing the party into disrepute.’

Flowers has already been suspended by the Methodist Church.

West Yorkshire Police last night confirmed they had begun an inquiry into possible criminal charges against Flowers, who has gone into hiding.

The scandal is an acute embarrassment for Labour and its 32 MPs who are sponsored by the Co-op Group.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has received £50,000 in donations from the Co-op, which prides itself on its ethical stance.

Ordinarily, the Rev Paul Flowers would have presided over the 10.30am service yesterday at Wibsey Methodist Church.

The
 gathering at the modern pebble-dashed church outside Bradford, West 
Yorkshire, lasts an hour and is followed by tea and biscuits.

But
 having been caught buying and using illegal drugs including crystal 
meth, crack cocaine and ketamine, it would hardly have seemed 
appropriate to take the pulpit.

Ridicule: The Rev Flowers during the Treasury Select Committee hearing

The Methodist Church appears to agree – Flowers has been suspended from his duties for three weeks. 

He
 has been one of its ministers for 40 years. Laudable, you might say. 
But does being in such a post really make one a suitable candidate to 
become chairman of the Co-operative Bank?

Was there something else in Flowers’s CV that qualified him for this most demanding of positions?

Well, to be fair, the openly gay Flowers did work for NatWest for four years, in the late 60s.

The
 position he held is not clear, but given the fact that he was 19 at the
 time and became a Methodist minister at the end of his tenure suggests 
the post was not a senior one. 

At
 a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee earlier this month, when 
asked to explain how he was qualified to run the bank following its 
£700million loss he replied: ‘I took the exam of the Institute of 
Bankers. 

‘I completed part one and the best part of part two of those exams before I became a Methodist minister.

‘I would judge that experience is out of date in terms of the needs of contemporary banking.’

Who would argue with that? Especially given his somewhat shaky grasp of figures.

He told the committee that the Co-op’s balance sheet had £3billion of assets, when the answer was in fact £47billion.

He was also at a loss to answer questions about the amount of loans on its books.

Perhaps
 there is some other evidence of financial wizardry, then, in his 
background? Yesterday the Mail searched long and hard, but could find 
nothing.

Paul Flowers was 
born in Portsmouth to parents Muriel and Charles but has lived in the 
North for many years. His father died in 1993 aged 70, and he had a 
brother, Ian, who died the same year aged just 39. He lives in a modest 
house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last 
year aged 85.

After that brief stint 
with the NatWest, he became a minister with the Methodist Church, for 
whom he now sits as a trustee on the body that manages its invested 
funds and property.

Twenty 
or so years ago, Flowers came to attention as vice-chairman of Rochdale 
Council’s social services committee during the ‘satanic abuse’ fiasco 
between 1988 and 1991.

It 
involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being 
performed on children and, as a result, 20 children from six families 
were placed in care.

However,
 the police found no evidence and a government-backed inquiry 
subsequently blamed ‘evangelical Christians’ for the scare.

Flowers maintained a high profile, sitting on committees and getting himself involved in community projects.

Ironically, given recent events, from 1992 to 2004 he was prominently 
involved with the Lifeline Project, which helps drug abusers. Today he 
remains a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV/Aids charity.

Speaking
 about his involvement with the charity, he once said: ‘As an out gay 
man for all of my adult life I am acutely aware of the issues 
surrounding HIV.

‘Like many others I have been personally affected by it in ways which are often far too painful  to recount.’

Flowers was a councillor at Bradford City Council for ten years but does not appear to have been universally popular.

One
 former councillor told the Mail yesterday: ‘Flowers was an insufferable
 and pompous man who threw his not inconsiderable weight around.

'He
 always made it plain he was the most educated person in a room and 
everyone else was a peasant.’ In 2010 – more irony – he was appointed by
 Labour leader Ed Miliband to the party’s finance and industry board.

None
 of this goes any way to explain just how Flowers became chairman of the
 proudly ethical Co-operative Bank. But it seems the system by which the
 appointment was made goes some way to solving the mystery.

Flowers rose through the Co-op’s ranks, joining the board of the Co-op Group in 2008 and becoming deputy chairman.

In
 2009 the post of chairman of Co-operative Banking group became vacant. 
Choosing the candidate fell to the 13-strong Remuneration and 
Appointments Committee, which is formed largely of former Labour 
politicians and Co-operative movement veterans.

It
 traditionally selected directors from the board of the  Co-operative 
Group. On that board of about 20 people, you would be unlikely to find 
any high-flying bankers. 

Or
 anyone, it seems, remotely up to the job of running a bank. The school 
leaver who worked at NatWest 40 years previously was the best they could
 find.
