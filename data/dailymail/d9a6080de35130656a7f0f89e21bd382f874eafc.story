The daughter of a woman whose charred bones were found three years after she vanished has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

Lois Hounslea, 21, was arrested by detectives investigating the death of Paula Hounslea, who disappeared in August 2009 after a family meal to celebrate her mother's birthday.

Police have confirmed that a 20 year-old man is also being quizzed on suspicion of murder.

Miss Hounslea, who was nicknamed 'Loey' by her family, tearfully appealed for her mother's return last Christmas, saying: 'It is the only present I want, that any of us want.' 

Her arrest follows a three-year investigation into the fate of Mrs Hounslea, who went missing after allegedly telling her daughter she was going to stay with a friend.

Merseyside Police launched inquiries on May 5 after a dog walker found Mrs Hounslea's charred bones in a firepit on the loopline in Fazkerley.

The grim discovery was made 12 feet down an embankment, near a disused railway line which is now a walking path.

Police investigating the death believe the woman's body may have been dumped as recently as February this year.

Officers recovered a gold necklace with the face of the Virgin Mary next to the body, and Mrs Hounslea's parents, Moira and Steve, got in touch when they saw it pictured in a local newspaper.

Their daughter's bones were identified using dental records, and forensic examination showed she had been lying in the popular beauty spot for around seven months.

The cruel blow came just three days after her grieving parents made a plea for information on what would have been Mrs Hounslea's 40th birthday.  

Officers are now urging locals to come forward with information about a suspicious fire in the area in the past year.

A Merseyside Police spokesperson said: 'Detectives have arrested a 21-year-old woman from West Derby and a 20-year-old man from Bowring Park on suspicion of the murder of Paula Hounslea.

'Merseyside Police launched a murder investigation following the discovery of her remains on the disused loopline railway on Saturday 5th May 2012.

'Officers were called to the loopline, near to its junction with Blackthorn Road, Fazakerley, following a call from a member of the public who had been walking his dog.

'The dog discovered bones that were subsequently identified as belonging to Paula Hounslea in what appears to have been an old fire pit on the embankment close to the railway line.

'Paula was 37 when she was reported missing from her home in West Derby on Saturday, 22nd August 2009.

'The man and woman arrested have been taken to a police station on Merseyside where they will be questioned by detectives.'

Since her mother's disappearance, Lois Hounslea has given birth to a daughter named Erin, now aged four months.

She said in a recent appeal: 'I’m living on my own in our house. I miss her so much and want her to come home. If anyone has seen her or knows where she is, please get in touch.'

In his appeal on May 2, Paula’s father Steve, 68, a former delivery driver, offered a reward for information about his daughter’s whereabouts.

He said: 'You just feel in limbo. It’s the not knowing that’s the worst. She’s a lovely girl.

'On reflection on the night before she disappeared, Paula was a bit quiet - but other than that, there was no indication there was anything wrong.

'It isn’t easy to come up with money but we are so desperate, it’s something we feel we have to do.

'We feel that somebody in Liverpool must know something and if we offer the reward maybe they’ll come forward and give us that information.

'If anybody knows anything, please, we would love to have some good news. Just to know that she is safe would be absolutely brilliant. She has the cheekiest of smiles. I believe one day I’ll see it again.'

He went on: 'She could be the most bubbly of people and generous to a fault. If you remarked you liked something she was wearing she’d hand it over; she’d give you the clothes from her back. For her to disappear was completely out of the blue.

'Our house was searched and Paula’s home too, but there was no clue found as to what might have happened.

'We were asked the same things again and again. Her closest friends were spoken to but nothing came to light as to why she might have gone. It was a true mystery.

'Paula’s a gran now. She should be cuddling her new granddaughter and forming a bond. It’s been hard for Lois, knowing she should be sharing that special time with her mum.'
