A couple broke into a theme park that was closed for the offseason near the South Carolina-North Carolina line, and the woman told investigators that God or, perhaps, aliens told her to do it.

Francis Greene, 30, and Jason Lee, 42, were arrested Friday night after a security officer at the Carowinds theme park found their truck abandoned in the parking lot their 8-month-old son.

Greene told police upon her arrest that she'd heard 'voices from God telling her to go see the park.'

Her story would later change to reflect a different sort of revelation, the Charlotte Observer reports.

Aliens made her do it: Francis Greene and Jason Lee were arrested Friday night after a security officer at the Carowinds theme park found their truck abandoned in the parking lot their 8-month-old son

She would later inform police that 'the voices that she thought were from God were actually extra-terrestrials, and that they wanted her to leave her body behind and come with them.'

Her presence on Earth notwithstanding, Greene would finally tell police she 'decided against that because she wanted to stay with her family.'

The guard said the couple returned to the truck 20 minutes after leaving it, and their baby boy, behind.

Greene was taken to an area hospital to undergo a mental health evaluation and for treatment for a hand injury she suffered while attempting to climb a fence at the park. 

She was charged with child neglect, filing a false police report and trespassing. Her bond was set at $15,000.

Lee is charged with child neglect and trespassing. His bond was set at $5,470.

It was not clear whether they had attorneys. The baby was taken into protective custody.

Carowinds straddles the South Carolina and North Carolina line and was closed for the season at the time of the alleged break in
