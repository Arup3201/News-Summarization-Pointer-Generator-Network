European students who took out taxpayer-funded loans to study at English universities are defaulting on nearly £40million of repayments, official figures have shown.

More than one in eight students from EU member states are failing to keep up with repayments after finishing their courses and leaving the UK.

The amount owed by defaulting students has tripled in just two years, from £12.7million in 2012 to £38.2million this year.

The figures from the Student Loans Company will renew concerns that British taxpayers will end up footing the bill for unpaid loans as EU students return home and disappear from the system.

It is claimed that thousands could receive a ‘free’ university education which costs UK-based graduates up to £9,000-a-year.

The statistics also showed that the total amount lent to EU students – including those who are currently studying - has rocketed by more than £200million in a year to £686.3million.

Since 2006, students from EU member states have been eligible for the same special low-interest Government-backed loans as home students to cover tuition fees at English universities.

Graduates based in Britain have their loan repayments automatically deducted from their payslips but there is no equivalent mechanism for those who move abroad.

They are required to supply earnings information to the Government and set up a direct debit to make repayments, or remember to pay online.

Officials insist that EU students leaving Britain and failing to repay will be pursued through the courts in their own countries. International ‘trace agents’ are deployed to ensure they pay up.

But the latest figures reveal the scale of the task.

They show that 49,100 EU students have become liable to start repaying loans since 2006.

Only 2,000 EU graduates who left the UK are currently actively repaying their loans.

'This raises a big question mark over how sustainable this all is in the long term.It is a case of EU law not working the way that it should' - James Clappison MP

James Clappison, the Conservative MP for Hertsmere, said UK taxpayers should be ‘very concerned’.

‘Under EU law, we have to give students from the mainland the same terms as British students and this raises a big question mark over how sustainable this all is in the long term. It is a case of EU law not working the way that it should.’

The total amount owed by all students, both British and EU, has ballooned to £54.4billion in 2013/14 following the introduction of £9,000-a-year tuition fees in 2012, the SLC figures show.

The amount has more than doubled in six years – from £21.95million in 2007/08.

Of this £54.4billion, £686.3million has been taken out by EU students.

Most has been lent to EU students still at university but £263.9million is classed as ‘liable for repayment’.

But loan accounts in arrears amount to £38.2million – up from £21.1million last year and £12.7million the year before.

A spokesman for the Student Loans Company said: ‘The SLC will continue to set up fixed payment schedules.

We do have processes in place to trace those who move away and have systems in place to pursue borrowers for repayment regardless of their location.

‘Part of this collection process includes engagement with overseas collections agents to ensure all repayments owed are paid.’
