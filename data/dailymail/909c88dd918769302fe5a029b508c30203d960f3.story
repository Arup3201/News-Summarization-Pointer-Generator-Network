A drink-driver who crashed in a country lane phoned her passenger's father instead of 999, leaving the distraught man to find his dead son at the scene.

Debbie Barker has been jailed for three years over the late-night crash which killed hotelier Tom Bannister as they drove home from his Coniston Hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire.

Police found Barker, 43, lying in a field in her nightdress four hours after she lost control of her Range Rover and hit a wall, a court heard. She was still over the drink-drive limit.

Event: The pair had left the Coniston Hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire, which Mr Bannister's family owned

Bradford Crown Court heard Mr Bannister, 48, had accepted a lift with Barker after an event at the hotel his family owned on June 22 last year.

As she wound through the Yorkshire Dales National Park near the village of Bell Busk, where he lived, the car rolled on a moderate bend and hit a wall, coming to rest in a field.

Father-of-one Mr Bannister was thrown from the car while Barker survived, concussed and unable to remember the car leaving the road.

She later told police that she did not have her phone, so she went to her friend's nearby home to raise help.

Sentence: Barker arriving at Bradford Crown Court yesterday, where she was jailed for three years

Ian Howard, prosecuting, said she was unable to gain a response so she then walked across fields to reach her own house.

But instead of phoning 999 she phoned Mr Bannister’s father, Michael, who went outside and found his son showing no signs of life.

An ambulance finally arrived at 2.57am and the victim, who suffered severe head injuries, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Half an hour later officers visited Barker's home, but saw she was not there and two mobile phones were on the kitchen table.

After a short search, they found her in a field just yards from her home at 4.09am. 

Several breath tests revealed Barker was over the drink drive limit. Police estimated she was at around twice the legal limit at the time of the accident, believed to have been around midnight.

Mr Howard said the call to Michael Bannister was 'probably made about two hours after the accident had taken place'.

Barker pleaded guilty to two charges - causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit, and failing to report an accident. 

Prosecutors argued Barker knew she was over the legal limit and wanted to delay being tested.

Malcolm Swift QC, defending, said the case was instead one of a 'ridiculous and stupid error'.

He told the court: 'She was briefly concussed for a short period of time after the accident and had no recollection of the car leaving the road.

'She was lying down in the field about 20ft from the house (when she was found). She says she didn’t know how she came to be in the that position but she came round when she heard voices.'

But Recorder of Bradford Judge Roger Thomas QC said Barker had done everything 'to keep herself out of the way and avoid detection'.

He added: 'The only sensible reason is she was trying to lie low and avoid the situation'.

The judge told her: 'You must have been significantly over the prescribed limit for driving.

'You failed to negotiate a fairly moderate bend in the road, going straight on a hitting a wall. It must have been apparent to you he was very badly injured.'

The court heard the Barkers and the Bannisters were friends, and Mr Bannister’s family had supported Barker after the accident.

Traffic Constable Andy Macleod, of North Yorkshire Police’s Roads Policing Group, said: 'Barker showed a callous disregard for Mr Bannister’s welfare when she left the scene of the collision.

Businessman: Police said hotelier Mr Bannister was a popular member of the community and his family was on good terms with Barker's. His relatives remained supportive towards her after the accident, the court heard

'The sentence reflects the gravity of the offences she committed and how seriously all agencies in the criminal justice system view them.'

Gerry Wareham, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for Yorkshire and Humberside, added: 'By getting behind the wheel of her vehicle after she had been drinking she took a huge and irresponsible risk and, very sadly, Mr Bannister paid for it with his life.

'She then neglected to alert emergency services as soon as practicable and it was several hours after the accident before any potential help arrived.

'Thomas Bannister was very well-known and much-loved in the local community. He was a father, a son and a friend to many and will be sorely missed.

'This terrible case has resulted in the loss of his life and devastated that of many others. I hope it serves as a stark warning of the potentially tragic consequences of drinking and driving.' 

Barker, of Gargrave, North Yorkshire, was jailed for three years and banned from driving for five years.
