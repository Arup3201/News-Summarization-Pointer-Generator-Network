The parents of a four-year-old girl who is allergic to school dinners say she is being forced to eat her packed lunch in an 'isolation room'.

The head teacher of Salusbury Primary School in Harlesden, north west London, allegedly told Lisa-Mbali McFarlane's parents it was 'anti-social' to eat her allergen-free meal around other pupils.

Free hot meals are compulsory for younger years, and Lisa's parents are now embroiled in a row with the school over the bizarre situation - which they have branded ridiculous.

Isolation: Four-year-old Lisa-Mbali McFarlane with her mother Gina Wolhunter, her father Axel McFarlane and her pink packed lunch. They claim she has been made to eat in isolation to avoid being 'anti-social'

Her mother Gina Wolhunter, a 36-year-old dance instructor, said: 'I couldn’t believe my ears. Why on Earth is it anti-social for my daughter to eat different food?

'We have a legitimate reason to not want her to eat school dinners. Her intolerances and allergies are still unclear, but we know which foods to keep her away from.

'I don’t think there’s anything wrong with school dinners there as a whole, but they are wrong for my daughter.'

Ms Wolhunter and Lisa's father Axel McFarlane, a plumber, say they are still going through the process of full allergy-testing for their daughter, whose problems began aged one.

That means they do not know the full extent of her allergies or what could be causing them.

However, they say she reacts the worst to sugar, dairy and artificial additives such as monosodium glutamate.

Mr McFarlane said: 'Our eight-year-old son Khwezi goes to Salusbury and he eats school lunches.

'It’s not the composition of the meals we have a problem with - it’s the mandatory nature of the school’s policy.

'If Lisa eats something that disagrees with her, she ends up with a horrific, hacking cough for as long as a week.

Children can develop one of hundreds of food allergies including milk, eggs, wheat, nuts, seeds and shellfish - with reactions ranging from a skin rash to vomiting and anaphylaptic shock.

Allergies to food additives such as E-numbers are relatively uncommon compared to those to milk and nuts.

Nut allergies are among the most common, afflicting up to one in 50 children according to the NHS.

Despite many outlets offering allergy tests, the charity Allergy UK claims this is not the best way to find out which foods are causing the problem.

The organisation says the 'gold standard' is to draw up strict diets and stick to them while keeping a detailed diary of symptoms.

'The cough sounds very painful too - why ever would we want to put our daughter through that?

'Now they’re effectively giving her a lunchtime detention, punishment for eating something different. It’s not on.'

The couple say head teacher Linda Kiernan spoke to them on the first day of term last month and insisted Lisa would have to eat school meals because it was 'anti-social' to have different food.

After weeks of rowing, the family say they came to a tentative agreement where Lisa eats in a separate room accompanied by one other pupil and the school nurse.

Mr McFarlane: 'We allowed her to have just one ice-cream from the van this summer, because she said she wanted to be like all her friends. 

'For a week afterwards she was up all night coughing, and her eczema flared up.'

The school provides free lunches to all children in the first three years as part of a flagship scheme by Nick Clegg, who said it would help improve concentration and raise learning standards.

Pupils in other years have the option of either eating school dinners or bringing in their own packed lunch, as long as it conforms to school health guidelines.

Ms Wolhunter added: 'Our son chooses whether he wants dinner or a packed lunch, and every time we make it for him, we have to conform to a series of very sensible nutritional guidelines.

'The school has banned chocolate, crisps and fizzy drinks, for example, which I think is absolutely fair enough.' 

Salusbury Primary School's head teacher declined to comment on the parents' claims earlier today. 

Mr McFarlane said: 'We are not food hippy parents, forcing our kids to only eat a vegan, whole food diet. We want to choose what our food-intolerant daughter eats, because she’s too young to control it herself.

'We have a legitimate reason - we’re not just being contrary for the sake of it.'
