World No 1 Novak Djokovic relaxed after his Davis Cup exploits by taking his pair of pet dogs for a walk in West Hollywood with wife Jelena Ristic.

The pair were spotted taking a stroll in Los Angeles on Wednesday after Djokovic had returned from helping Serbia to a 5-0 whitewash against Croatia to set up a Davis Cup quarter final against Argentina.

The dogs - Pierre and Tesla - have been regularly seen alongside this year's Australian Open champion, including spending a holiday with their owners in St Tropez last year.

Serbia's No 1 played a major role in his country's victory, beating Mate Delic in singles before teaming up with Nenad Zimonjic to beat Marin Draganja and Franko Skugor in the doubles.

Djokovic, though, wasn't even initially supposed to play in the match. Viktor Troicki was named to play alongside Zimonjic but Serbia coach Bogdan Obradovic opted for Djokovic after his impressive performance against Delic.

Meanwhile, the player renowned for his forward thinking when it comes to fitness has taken to practicing ballet with his Ristic after the current Wimbledon  champion posted a photo online of the couple together and wrote: 'Ballet with my wife'.
