A British man was due to appear in court in Melbourne today after what police said was the world’s first arrest for illegal courtside gambling  during a tennis tournament.

The 22-year-old, who has not been named, is alleged to have been acting for a gambling syndicate in Eastern Europe or Central Asia.

He is said to have used a hidden device at the Australian Open in Melbourne to take advantage of the few seconds’ delay between the live action and what is seen on TV.

Scam: The 22-year-old Briton is alleged to have used a hidden device at the Australian Open in Melbourne

He faces up to ten years in jail if convicted of behaving in a way that would corrupt a betting outcome.

According
 to police, the man sat at matches in the opening days of the tournament
 and used an electronic device to send messages to an associate.

That
 second person allegedly then placed bets before a TV delay – of between
 seven and ten seconds – caught up and bookmakers changed the odds.

It
 is not known what matches the Briton watched, but the tournament has 
attracted the big names of the sport, including Britain’s Andy Murray, 
Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.

Australian
 police said the man flew into Melbourne specifically for the Grand Slam
 event, but was caught and charged after a sharp-eyed official became 
suspicious.

Deputy Commissioner of Police in Melbourne,  Graham Ashton, said the device was concealed in the man’s clothing.

At
 various stages, he allegedly pressed buttons on it to indicate, for 
example, whether a point had been won or lost or a double fault served

This allowed his associate to place bets on certain outcomes before they ‘happened’ on bookmakers’ television screens.

Mr
 Ashton added: ‘We believe he is part of a syndicate, but we don’t yet 
have the details. I don’t think it’s an isolated incident.

‘Overseas,
 certainly, there are examples in relation to football, in relation to 
cricket. It’s been around for several years. It’s becoming more 
difficult to do because of the speed of communications and technology, 
but it is still very active.’

Police said they received information about the man’s alleged activities and arrested him after checking CCTV evidence.

Detectives
 said investigations were continuing to find the person he was sending  
messages to – believed to be in Melbourne – although it is thought the 
syndicate leaders are in Europe or Asia.

Tennis Australia said last night it would ‘continue to do whatever is necessary’ to rid illegal activity from the sport.
