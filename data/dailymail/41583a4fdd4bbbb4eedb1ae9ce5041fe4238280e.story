When a party host invited too many guests to stay at his hilltop home overlooking Lake Maggiore in Switzerland, he had to find space for them somehow.

And with the guests arriving shortly, he knew it had to be done fast.

So he flew in a micro-home by helicopter over the picturesque landscape to his luxury abode, which luckily took just four minutes and nine seconds to install.

All welcome: The buyer had the home flown in especially by helicopter to house the extra guests that he didn't have space to house

Smaller than a snooker table, it 
comprises a single space that's just 8ft 7in square, and even estate 
agents might struggle to find a word other than 'compact' to describe 
the living arrangements.

But according to its designers, this small white cube could be the businessman's home of the future.

Compact: The host had the micro home installed in just four minutes on the hillside overlooking Lake Maggiore in Switzerland

Just in time: Builders took just four minutes and nine seconds to instll the micro home

Made
from aluminium with a wooden frame, it is called a micro-compact home 
(or m-ch for short) and comes with all mod cons including a plasma 
screen, built in hi-fi and fully-fitted kitchen.

Horden Cherry Lee architects came up with the original Micro Compact 
home prototype back in 2005, which was constructed using a wooden frame 
and based on traditional Japanese tea-houses.

State of the art: Made from aluminium with a wooden frame, it is called a micro-compact home (or m-ch for short) and comes with all mod cons including a plasma screen, built in hi-fi and fully-fitted kitchen

Mod cons: There is a fold-away double bed (the five-place dining table also converts into a spare double bed in case you have guests), a shower and lavatory

Home of the future? According to its designers, this white cube could be the businessman's home of the future

There is a fold-away double bed (the 
five-place dining table also converts into a spare double bed in case 
you have guests), a shower and lavatory.

In
fact, you won't need to buy any furniture at all if you purchase an 
m-ch as everything you need has been cleverly incorporated into the 
design.

They are on sale with a guide price of £50,000, which includes supply and installation of one unit with all interior fittings and connection to water, gas and electricity services.

High tech: The model has been modified to include a lightweight structure, optional roof photovoltaic solar panels that are combined with a small diameter vertical axis wind generator, long duration LED lighting and external walkways

Inspired: It was constructed using a wooden frame and based on traditional Japanese tea-houses

The firm's director Richard Horden initiated the m-ch concept at Technical University Munich, where he teaches.

A case study 'village' of seven m-ch homes has already proved a hit with students in Germany.

Mr Horden, who also happily lived in one for three days a week, has said: 'It is specifically designed for short-stay smart living and is suitable for a variety of locations, providing sophisticated compact accommodation for business or leisure use.'

Made in Austria, the homes come with a five-year guarantee.

Plans:The 2.6 meter (8.53 ft) wide cube home weighs only 1.8 short tons (1.6 metric tons), due to its light-weight aluminum frame and boasts an estimated energy consumption of 4-5 kWh per day

Blueprints: The design includes a lightweight structure, optional roof photovoltaic solar panels that are combined with a small diameter vertical axis wind generator, long duration LED lighting and external walkways

'Like a car, the lifespan of the m-ch is dependent on the care in use,' said a spokesman for the manufacturers, adding: 'The layout is influenced by traditional Japanese teahouse architecture with space divided into distinct zonal layers.

'No one could really live in it all the time, but while you are it's very comfortable.'
