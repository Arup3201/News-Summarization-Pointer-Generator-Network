Simon Cowell's pregnant girlfriend Lauren Silverman reached a divorce settlement with estranged husband Andrew in August, and now new details of the rather unusual agreement have emerged.

The terms included a clause that states the X Factor mogul cannot go near Lauren's son Adam, aged seven, until January 2015, according toÂ TMZ. If he does, Lauren will be fined $50,000. A spokesperson for Lauren declined to comment to MailOnline.

TMZ also reported on Thursday the exes are using mutual friend Sir Philip Green, the billionaire CEO of the Arcadia Group, as well as attorney Martin Edelman to settle any future disputes over the next five years.

From friends to foes: On Thursday TMZ reported Andrew Silverman (left) doesn't want his son Adam, aged seven, to be around his old pal - and now ex-wife's soon-to-be baby daddy - Simon Cowell (right) until 2015

Also, if Lauren allows her son and Simon to interact three times, she will lose all contact with her child until a court decides what to do.

Andrew and Simon used to be friends, and the New York City businessman is allegedly so upset that his pal has romanced and impregnated his wife (she's six months along) that he added a few other unusual clauses into his divorce.

Lauren has to make sure her son doesn't call Simon - who UsWeekly claimed this week has a ring and will propose to the Manhattan beauty next year - 'father.' Andrew has to make sure the child doesn't call anyone but Lauren 'mother.'

TMZ also reports, 'The settlement agreement also provides Andrew cannot trash Simon to Adam and has a legal obligation to make sure no one else around him talks smack.'

As far as child support, Andrew is paying his socialite ex only $3,000 a month. The site speculates that 'Simon will become the cash cow.' The British TV personality is reportedly worth $370m.

Finally, Lauren and Andrew altered the the cause of divorce from adultery to 'broken down irretrievably.'

Simon, who was spotted with Lauren in West Hollywood on Wednesday evening, has never looked happier.

News that Simon had impregnated Lauren broke in late July when the beauty was 10 weeks along.

E! reported Lauren, Andrew and Simon had been longtime friends, having met on a vacation years ago.

In 2012 the trio was photographed looking like very close friends while aboard a yacht.

But in early 2013 a romance reportedly blossomed between the reality icon and the stunning brunette.

'He was friends with Lauren and her husband but things developed between them,' E!'s source explains. 'Lauren and her husband had a messy split and Simon became a shoulder to cry on for her.'
