An off-duty police officer who was shot dead trying to protect the public from a crazed gunman has been awarded the George Medal for his bravery.

PC Ian Dibell was killed after stepping in to try and stop killer Peter Reeve, who had shot at a couple near his home in Clacton, Essex, in July last year.

PC Dibell has now become the first police officer in the country to receive the award in more than 20 years.

Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh said the award rightly ranks Mr Dibell as 'one of the bravest people in the country'.

'He has been recognised posthumously for his immense courage and sacrifice. He selflessly and knowingly put his own life at risk to protect the innocent people of Clacton,' he said.

'PC Dibell paid the ultimate price for his actions, but he will never be forgotten by his colleagues in Essex Police, or the people of this county.

'We all owe him such a huge debt of gratitude. I am sure that this award will be cherished by Ian's family, friends and colleagues who still so keenly feel his loss.'

The George Medal is granted in recognition of acts of great bravery and is primarily a civilian honour. Just over 2,100 medals have been awarded since its inception in 1940.

It is the latest in a string of awards given to Pc Dibell after his death.

In October he was voted the most courageous officer at the annual Police Bravery Awards and he also received a High Commendation from his force.

After an inquest into his death found PC Dibell was 'unlawfully killed', coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said he should be awarded a medal for his bravery.

Gunman Reeve was found dead in a churchyard the next day after taking his own life.

Detective Inspector Paul Dibell, PC Dibell's brother, said he was immensely proud.

'He did an extraordinary act in protecting the public. His bravery, professionalism and happy memories of him as my brother and colleague will never be forgotten,' he said.

PCSO Louise Lilley, PC Dibell's partner, also welcomed the news.

She said he had made a decision to keep the community safe and paid with his life.

She added: 'This selfless act has now been recognised at the highest level. He will be remembered by the country for his heroic act, but to me he was just my Ian.'
