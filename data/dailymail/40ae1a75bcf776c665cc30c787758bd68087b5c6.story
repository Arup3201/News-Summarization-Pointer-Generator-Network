Both candidates vying to become the next New York City mayor
have announced they support added vacation days for Muslim public school
students.

Democrat and frontrunner Bill de Blasio said Wednesday that
it’s only fair to give religious holidays off for the city Muslim students just
as they do for Christians and Jews.

His Republican opponent Joe Lhota agreed and said he’s
supported such a revision of the public school schedule throughout his
candidacy.

'Different faiths coming together': NYC mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio spoke to Muslim Americans in Brooklyn Wednesday, where he said he supports two new school holidays for religious observance

‘We're not going to lose the school days,’ Lhota said
Wednesday. ‘We'll have to extend the school days by
those two days. But nonetheless those who are Muslim will be allowed to have
that day off to celebrate their holidays.’

'Those who are Muslim will be allowed to have that day off': de Blasio's Republican rival Joe Lhota said Wednesday that he's supported Muslim holidays in NYC schools throughout his campaign

Both candidates support days off for New York City’s nearly
150,000 Muslim public school students on the two most holy days of the Muslim
calendar, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

‘The origins of this nation, people of many different
faiths coming together,’ said de Blasio. ‘That's why we have to respect Muslim
faiths by providing the Eid school holidays for children in our school system.’

De Blasio pointed out that, like Hanukkah or Easter, these
Muslim fall on different days each year, which can force students to choose
between education and faith.

‘A child who has an exam on a day that right now is one of
the Eid holidays, they're either respecting their religious obligation or
they're doing what their education requires of them. They can't do both under
our current system,’ de Blasio said Wednesday at an event in Brooklyn for
Muslim Americans.

In 2006, an Eid holiday fell on a day of required state-wide
tests.

Arguments for and against the instatement of Muslim school
holidays have been echoing around New York City for years, but three-term Mayor
Michael Bloomberg has continued to oppose them.

‘Everybody would like to be recognized, but the truth of the
matter is we need more school days, not less,’ the mayor said in 2009.

Unfair? While both Jewish and Christian students see their holy days observed with days off from school, the city's nearly 150,000 Muslim students get none of their holidays off from school

Two more holidays would bring the number of days off per
year for New York City students to 15.

Currently, none of those days are for Muslim holidays,
though around 13 percent of public school children in the city are believed to
practice Islam.

State law requires all schools be open for 183 total days,
but does not stipulate which days specifically.

The issue is one on which the two starkly different
candidates can actually agree.

At a televised debate Tuesday, they disagreed on issues
ranging from tax hikes to public safety to their baseball allegiances, each
presenting themselves as the most qualified choice to lead a city preparing to
take its first steps beyond the 12-year reign of Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

New Yorkers will cast their vote and despite between the two starkly different candidates November 5.
