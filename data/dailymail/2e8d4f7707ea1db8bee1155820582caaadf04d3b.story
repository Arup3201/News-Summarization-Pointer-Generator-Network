Disgraced: Commander Sarah West, 42, has left the Navy with a resettlement package after serving less than half of her 12-month notice period

A disgraced female Royal Navy captain, removed from her ship amid claims of a sexual relationship with a male officer, has been granted early retirement and a pay-off estimated to be worth tens of thousands of pounds.

Commander Sarah West – who was found to have broken strict codes of social conduct while serving as captain of HMS Portland – has left the Navy with a resettlement package after serving less than half of her 12-month notice period.

Defence sources confirmed last night that the 42-year-old, who was paid up to £79,524 a year, has served her last day after persuading top brass to grant her a quick release from her terms of service.

In July, she was flown back to Britain from the Caribbean amid claims of an affair with her third-in-command, newly married Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 37.

At the time the 5,000-ton frigate was conducting anti-narcotics patrols around the West Indies.

While military police questioned the ship’s crew about claims of an alleged affair, Commander West went on annual leave for ‘personal reasons’. She later transferred to a desk job at Fleet Headquarters in Hampshire.

During the investigation, both denied claims they had an affair. Even so, Commander West was found to have breached rules which forbid relationships that could undermine the operational effectiveness of a ship or a naval unit. Naval sources confirmed these rules can be broken even without an affair taking place.

In 2012, Commander West, from Grimsby, became the first female captain of a major warship in the Navy’s 500-year history.

At the time she gave an interview describing how being at sea has made it difficult to maintain a relationship. She married pilot Andrew Whitlum in 1998 but they later separated.

She said: ‘Lots of women in the services have challenging roles. There are drawbacks, though. Years at sea probably explains why I’m single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.’

Commander West will be entitled to 11 weeks’ paid holiday and additional financial help while she finds a new job and settles into civilian life.

Lieutenant Commander Gray remains in service and is understood still to be with his wife Melissa, an engineer from Bristol.

Settlement: Commander West, from Grimsby, has been given a pay-off estimated to be worth tens of thousands of pounds. She is the first female captain of a major warship in the Navy’s 500-year history

Last night, Susan Morgan, the longest-serving female officer in Navy history, who retired in 2012 after 34 years’ service, said: ‘It is a great shame Commander West is leaving as she was highly regarded and very popular among her colleagues. She blazed a trail for women in the Navy.’

Commander West’s mother Gillian refused to comment.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘It is not the policy to make public any individual personnel matters; it would be inappropriate to comment.
