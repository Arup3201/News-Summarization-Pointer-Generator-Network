Penny pincher: Ariel Castro, pictured in his latest mugshot, so tight with money he would split McDonald's burgers in half with his own family

The House of Horrors suspect was so tight with money he would split McDonald's burgers in half with his own family rather than let them eat a whole one, MailOnline can reveal.

Ariel Castro would cut the bun in two with a knife and serve it to his wife as he thought the meal - which costs as little as $1 - was too expensive.

When he dined alone, he would eat half of a burger and then lie to McDonald's workers, saying there was a hair in it just so he could get a new one.

Relatives said that Castro was 'greedy' all the time and would never let anything go - even a 25-cent trinket at a yard sale.

Castro's tight-fistedness was all too apparent in the state of his Cleveland, Ohio home which police have described as 'abysmal at best.'

He is accused of using it to keep victims Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight captive for a decade during which time he repeatedly had sex with them.

Castro, 52, starved the women for days on end and when he eventually fed them it would be fast food meals from the McDonald’s a few blocks away, neighbors have said.

His former brother-in-law Frank Caraballo said that it all fit the profile of a man who was 'obsessed' with controlling other people.

He said: ‘He was greedy, he didn't like to spend any money. He had money but he watched how he spent everything.

'He used to take us McDonald's and we would buy a hamburger and he would split it up. He was that greedy.

'He would go in there, buy a cheeseburger, eat half and say there as a hair in there just to get another one.'

Mr Caraballo said that Castro could ‘talk people down’ and was very persuasive.

He said: ‘Somebody is selling a car for a dollar, he could talk them down to half price.

'I don't know how he'd do it. We would go to yard sales and there would be something for a quarter. We would be thinking, oh, it's just a quarter.

'Ariel would ask: are you taking ten cents for that? Anything he bought he always has to get a deal out of it.

Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she

Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing

'Ariel could be a really good guy and that next day this guy he would be such an a**hole.

'I'd think: I'd like to beat his a**.'

Castro is being held in jail on $8million bail under a suicide watch, charged with rape and kidnapping.

Prosecutors said they plan to bring additional counts, possibly including murder charges punishable by death for allegedly forcing at least one of his pregnant captives to miscarry over and over again by punching her in the stomach.

A DNA test has confirmed that he fathered the now six-year-old girl born to Amanda Berry while in captivity.
