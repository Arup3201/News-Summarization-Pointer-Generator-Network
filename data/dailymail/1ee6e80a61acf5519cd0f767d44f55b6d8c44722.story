It's bad enough missing a penalty down at your local park where only your mates as well as one man and his dog see your shocking spot-kick attempts.

But spare a thought for Micah Richards, whose miss in front of TV cameras effectively handed Olympiacos a 5-4 penalty shootout victory over his Manchester City side following a 2-2 draw in the International Champions Cup.

The result saw City crash out of the pre-season tournament in the United States, but the pain lived longer for Richards as images of his ridiculously high left leg following the miss went viral across the internet.
