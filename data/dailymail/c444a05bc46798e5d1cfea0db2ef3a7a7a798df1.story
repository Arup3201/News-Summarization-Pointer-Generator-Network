West Ham are set for a major boost with the news that wonderkid Reece Oxford is poised to commit his long term future to the club.

Oxford, who turned 16 last month, is viewed as one of England's talents with all of the Premier League's elite looking to poach him from Upton Park.

Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown a major interest in the teenager in recent months, leading to genuine fears from within West Ham that they could lose Oxford.

But the young defender is close to agreeing a new contract with the Hammers that will - for the time being - end any uncertainty over his future.

Talks over fresh terms have been ongoing for several weeks. Discussions had originally stalled, but it is understood a breakthrough has now been made that will see Oxford, who has captained England Under-17s, put pen to paper.

Oxford - who was 15 at the time - was an unused substitute in the Capital One Cup defeat against Sheffield United in September - a clear indication of how highly regarded he is by West Ham staff.

The central defender, who has been likened to former Hammers academy graduate Rio Ferdinand, could have left for a nominal fee in the summer when his contract was due to expire.

But the Hammers are now confident that scenario has been avoided after positive talks.
