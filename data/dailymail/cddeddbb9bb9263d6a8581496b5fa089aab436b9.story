A 24-hour television channel solely dedicated to Paralympian athlete Oscar Pistorius is to go on air in South Africa the day before he goes on trial accused of murdering his girlfriend.

The channel's producers have promised 'round-the-clock coverage of the legal proceedings, as well as exclusive documentaries, profiles and in-depth expert analysis'.

Oscar Pistorius, 27, shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead as she stood behind the locked toilet door of his Pretoria house on Valentines Day last year.

Pistorius has admitted killing Reeva, 29, by shooting her four times with loaded handgun he kept under his bed.

However he insists he did so by accident as he mistook her for an intruder.

South African police say the athlete, who whose legs were amputated below the knee when he was a young boy, shot her deliberately in a fit of rage.

Once considered to be the golden boy of South African sport, the accusation has seen The Blade Runner's reputation crumble.

He does, however, retain a significant amount of support among those who believe his explanation of Reeva's death.

Pistorius' trial is scheduled to take place over three weeks next month and is expected to generate an enormous local and international interest.

The Oscar Pistorius channel's stated hopes of televising it live, however, are far from certain to be realised.

South African criminal courts are not televised as a matter of routine. Proceedings can only be filmed if the judge makes a specific ruling to allow it.

Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa, who will hear the case, has not yet ruled on whether she will allow television cameras into Pretoria's High Court.

Little has been heard of Mr Pistorius since his last court hearing in August when he was officially charged with murder.

Then, his spokeswoman Anneliese Burgess said was doing little but focusing on his eventual trial.Since then his legal team are reported to have worked with a specialist American forensic experts, who are expected to try to counter the police's bullet hole evidence.
