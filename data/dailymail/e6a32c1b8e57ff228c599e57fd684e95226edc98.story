For sale – a speedboat, one not-so-careful crime-fighting owner…

One of a pair of boats made for the 1966 Batman movie and the 1960s TV series was put up for auction at the weekend.

The vessel, complete with tail fin and flashing beacon, was put up for sale by Batman collector and enthusiast Mark Perkins at Brooklands in Surrey.

He has owned the Batboat, made by Glastron Industries, for four years but said he had now run out of space.

‘It’s not your everyday piece of machinery,’ he said. ‘It’s as good as new and ready to fight crime.’ 

The Batboat, was made from a standard Glastron V-174. 

The makers added a red flashing beacon, glowing eyes, ‘Bazooka hatches’, seats, twin windscreens, and an aft deck cover with a glowing Bat-Signal on the tail fin.

A water squirter and jet nozzle were added to make the Batboat look as if it was nuclear-powered.

It had been expected to fetch between £36,000 and £40,000 at the auction, but failed to sell.

Mr Perkins’ boat, which has all its original running gear and is sea-worthy, was never used for filming the movie starring Adam West and Burt Ward but as a promotional tool in the US.

‘When we roar down the River Thames the looks we get, especially dressed up as Batman and Robin on a Sunday afternoon, are just fantastic,’ said Mr Perkins, who lives in Berkshire.

He said he’d thought the boat would go to a museum or private collector.

A spokesman for auctioneers Historics said hundreds of people had attended the six-hour auction.
