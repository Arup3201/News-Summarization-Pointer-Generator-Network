A disgruntled Chinese restaurant worker abducted and murdered his boss's ten-month-old baby nephew after quitting his job because he felt he had been badly treated.

Wang Wenlian, 45, took the child from the Chuanfu hotpot restaurant, in Jiaxing City, in east China's Zhejian Province.

It is understood he said he had a grudge against his former boss and colleagues because they had not treated him with the proper respect.

Wang, whose job was to kill chickens at the restaurant, reportedly resigned from his position after his employers complained he was too slow.

His former employers however continued to give him money and allowed him to live in a room above the restaurant.

On the day of the abduction, Wang had gone to speak to his old employers when he saw them with friends and family. He then carried away his former boss's nephew.

Wang allegedly told police he 'got angry' when the baby kept crying and killed him before dumping the body in a shallow grave.

The baby's body was found in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Wang was later arrested in a drinking den in the local Tanghui sub-district, police said.

Police said the restaurant owner was the aunt of the child. Their names were not revealed by detectives.

The news that the child's body had been found came the next day.

Wang was described as introverted and a loner who was hired out of pity. His former boss said he was slow and had quit but was believed to have nurtured the grudge which led to the kidnapping plot.
