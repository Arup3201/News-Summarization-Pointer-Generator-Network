During his 25 years on Newsnight, Jeremy Paxman earned acclaim for humiliating politicians with his scathing interview style.

But far from hailing the presenter as one of the great TV journalists, the programme’s new boss claims Paxman’s aggressive interrogations ‘didn’t produce any real enlightenment’.

Ian Katz, 46, who took over as editor of the current affairs programme last September, also branded him ‘petulant’ and difficult to work with.

And he revealed that Paxman, 64, initially refused to take part in a much-discussed interview with Russell Brand, broadcast on the BBC2 show last October.

The segment saw Paxman call the comedian ‘trivial’ and ‘facetious’ for claiming voting was pointless. 

Mr Katz, former deputy editor of The Guardian, said such scepticism towards his ideas was common from Paxman. ‘I’d love to know if he was less petulant in meetings before I got there,’ he said.

‘I think that’s just his modus operandi.

‘He’s dyspeptic about pretty much everything. Ideas are flattened.

'Almost everything you suggest Jeremy will think is “preposterous” or “infantile” or an otherwise “completely lamentable” idea, and that’s a challenge because you have to sell it to him.’

As a result, he says, the programme’s producers were ‘pretty terrified’ of Paxman.

But Mr Katz, who was speaking to the Evening Standard, admitted he was ‘utterly charming and quite generous to very junior people’, and ‘courtly’ to women.

In The Financial Times last week, Mr Katz said the ‘predominance of an aggressive [interview] style’ has made modern political discourse ‘dull’ and predictable.

Asked if, by saying this, he was ‘sticking the knife in’ to his former colleague, he told the Standard: ‘I tried hard not to. I said I thought Paxman was one of the few things that made political interviews watchable for a long time because he was so thrilling even if it didn’t produce any real enlightenment.’

Critics have expressed concern over the direction of Newsnight since Mr Katz took over, accusing it of becoming lightweight. Paxman’s representative did not respond to requests for comment.
