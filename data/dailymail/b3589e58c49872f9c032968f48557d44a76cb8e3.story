He has become as well known for his acid-tongued outbursts as for his historical insights.

But yesterday David Starkey faced 
calls to be dropped as a BBC panellist after his latest outrageous 
appearance on Question Time.

The broadcaster and Tudor expert said
 France resented Britain and the U.S. for liberating it from Nazi 
occupation, adding: ‘People don’t like being freed.’

Mr Starkey said people 'don't like to be freed' and they mistake their 'liberators' for 'conquerors'

He went on to attack his fellow  
panellists, MPs John Redwood, Rachel Reeves and Jo Swinson, before 
accusing an audience member of ‘insolence’.

His comments prompted a backlash from viewers, who branded his performance ‘rude’, ‘intolerant’ and ‘offensive’.

The academic has previously been 
accused of racism after describing Scotland, Wales and Ireland as 
‘feeble little countries’ on the BBC1 panel programme, and blaming 
‘black culture’ for the riots that swept the country last August.

Anglo-French relations began to sour after France's surrender to the Nazis.

The French felt bitterness towards the
 British for evacuating Dunkirk after being cut off by the German army -
 in a move even Churchill described as a 'colossal military disaster'.

Meanwhile, Britain was understandably frustrated by France's decision to collaborate with the enemy.

Within two weeks of the armistice signing, the British had shelled the French fleet, fearing it could fall into German hands.

This onslaught, at Mers-el-Kébir, on the coast of what was then French Algeria, left 1,297 French sailors dead and 350 wounded.

Over the next four years, four more Vichy French colonies were hit - with around 10,000 Frenchmen killed or injured.

The turning point came on August 24, 1944, with an uprising of the French Resistance against the German garrison in Paris.

Shortly after, the US Third Army under General Patton entered the fray.

And when the Americans entered Paris, they were warmly greeted.

But the sheer number of US troops took its toll on the city's infrastructure - and tensions grew between the liberated and the liberators.

With the Allied rescue came France's search for a national identity - and a return to its dignity.

In his appearance on Question Time 
this week, Dr Starkey, 67, said the West should not  intervene in Syria 
because nations should free themselves from oppression.

He said: ‘Humanitarian intervention is almost always disastrous. Let me give you an example, it’s called France.

‘You will remember Britain and 
America liberated France. What thanks did we get from them? The French 
have spent the last 40 years trying to obliterate the shame by doing 
everything they can to damage Britain and America.’

He went on: ‘People don’t like being freed, they mistake liberators for conquerors.’ 
Shocked host David Dimbleby asked if he was suggesting Britain and the Allies should not have acted to save France in 1944.

Dr Starkey replied: ‘No, I’m not 
David. We didn’t go into France to liberate France, we went into France 
to destroy Nazi Germany.’

He also accused his fellow panellist 
Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, of ‘cheap 
posturing’ and branded Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson ‘pompous’.

When an audience member dared to 
accuse him of ‘propaganda’, he turned on him, saying: ‘Why do you have 
the insolence to think that your opinion is better than anybody else’s?’

Dr Starkey also attacked Conservative MP John Redwood, calling him ‘completely inhuman’.

David Starkey made his comments to an audience at Dewsbury Town Hall on Thursday night's Question Time when the panel were discussing whether it would be right to intervene in Syria

To give his remarks some historical context, the German military machine had defeated the French by mid-1940.

An armistice, signed in June, saw Paris governed by the Nazis - and the establishment of Vichy France - a government in thrall to their conquerors.

Many in the Question Time audience no doubt wondered what military strategy 'Field Marshal' Starkey would have offered as an alternative to the Allied liberation.

Fortunately, Churchill and Roosevelt had made up their minds - which saw American troops entering Paris in 1944, and Germany's retreat.

Dr Starkey says 'We didn't have humanitarian intervention to save Louis XVI (left) and said Britain has this 'weird notion, exemplified by the divinely ordained Tony Blair that you go and give people freedom'

Dozens of viewers complained about Dr
 Starkey’s behaviour on the social networking site Twitter, with several
 calling for him to be dropped.

One, Jonathan Glen said: ‘Why is David Starkey allowed on the BBC unchallenged? The bile and excrement spewing from his mouth is as offensive as any BNP tirade.’

A BBC spokesman said 72 complaints were made about the programme and added: ‘The selection of potential panellists is an ongoing process.’
