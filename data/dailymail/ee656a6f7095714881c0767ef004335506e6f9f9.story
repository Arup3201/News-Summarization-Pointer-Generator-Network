Blurry photographs taken by a circus chimpanzee have fetched an incredible £50,000 at auction.

The collection of images of Moscow's Red Square, which were taken by Russian ape Mikki in the 1990s, were part of a sale of Russian photography at Sotheby's in London.

They were bought by a Russian buyer.

Mikki, a performer with the Moscow Circus, was trained to take pictures in the 1990s by Russian conceptual artists Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid.

The project called Collaboration with Animals aimed to challenge ideas of artistic value by asking the question of whether only humans were capable of creating true art.

It began in 1978 with a series of drawings done by a dog. A series of paintings by an elephant in an Ohio zoo later resulted in the founding of three Art Academies for Elephants in Thailand.

The sale also included some images of Mikki standing by his camera which were taken by the duo.

Jo Vickery of Sotheby's contemporary art department said, 'You know when people say with contemporary art, "I could do that", this really talks to that.'

The buyer, Russian art collector Kira Flanzaich, said the photos were a fine example of conceptual art.

'Sometimes you think that animals can maybe photograph or do other things better than a human being,' she said. "So we could see it in this particular piece, because Mikki took the photographs that are quite good of Red Square."  

The set of pictures went under the hammer at Sotheby's auction house in London and were snapped up by a Russian bidder

Unfortunately Mikki was not around to enjoy the praise. The chimp died in 2007.

The Sotheby's sale, Changing Focus: A Collection of Russian & Eastern European Contemporary Photography, is expected to achieve over £313,250.

It included over 800 photographs by artists of the former Soviet Union.

Ms Vickery added: 'This auction marks a significant step in the market for Russian and Eastern-European contemporary photography.

'It reflects the mounting international appetite for such works, and reveals the radical critical reassessment of the genre which has taken place in recent years.'
