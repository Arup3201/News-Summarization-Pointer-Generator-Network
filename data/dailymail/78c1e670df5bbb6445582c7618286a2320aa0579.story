A primary school principal has been slammed over distasteful comments made about students with mental health problems in a school newsletter.

Parents and disability groups have been outraged by a newsletter that went out to about 50 staff at Calare public school in Orange, written by principal, Christian Cundy.

In it he referred to students who may be bullying victims or have mental health issues as 'morons', 'nut cases' and 'village idiots'.

The Daily Telegraph reported the head of the school also suggested staff attempting to identify students to participate in a mental health and social skills program look for children with 'two heads” and 'webbed feet'.

The letter also read: 'I will send out a well-scripted letter in week 4 starting off — Have you bred a moron? You might like to access the services of Calare’s new initiative, ‘Operation Nutcase’. Sign on the dotted line or leave your thumbprint if you cannot write.'

The principal's comments were condemned and prompted anonymous complaints to the department of education, which resulted in Mr Cundy being forced to apologise.

The controversial newsletter at the school was telling staff about an all-day program to be conducted at the school by a professional company.

'If you are a bit of a nut yourself you might want to squeeze in a session between the kids and lie on my couch,' it said.   

It's believed that jokes, at the expense of children with disabilities or mental health issues, have greatly upset some members of the school community.

A department spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'the principal appreciates that the material was unacceptable and apologises for any offence it caused.'

In the newsletter principal Christian Cundy referred to students who may be bullying victims or have mental health issues as 'morons', 'nut cases' and 'village idiots'.

'He has undertaken not to include any material of this nature in future staff newsletters. He has been formally counselled by the department.'

'The department stresses that the material is contrary to the values of public education and the school’s track record of support for students with disabilities and other learning needs,' they said. 

The comments have provoked anger amongst disability groups. Autism Advisory and Support Service founder and president Grace Fava told the Daily Telegraph she was angered by the shameful' comments and called for stronger action against the principal.

'You do not joke about this — he is supposedly the head of a school filled with kids who have special needs,' Ms Fava said.
