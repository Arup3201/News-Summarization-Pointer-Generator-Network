Sir Michael Wilshaw branded Birmingham 'a national disgrace'

Birmingham has been branded a 'national disgrace' by Ofsted's chief inspector, who said the city is one of the worst places to grow up in the developed world. 

Sir Michael Wilshaw highlighted the infant mortality rate in Britain’s second city, which is higher than Cuba's and almost twice the national average.

He singled Birmingham out in a scathing report that found 20 areas in England where councils do not have ‘the most basic acceptable practice in place’.

Sir Michael blamed Birmingham, where a third of children live in poverty, for ‘failure of corporate governance on a grand scale’.

Birmingham recently published a review
 of the cruel murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams by his mother in 
2011. His case was dealt with by unqualified staff and students.

Birmingham City Council, one of the 20 to be classed as 'inadequate', 
has now failed on seven inspection judgements, Ofsted said.

Sir
 Michael said: ‘It is an absolute disgrace and government needs to look 
at this with real urgency. If better governance means breaking [the 
department] up so children are better protected, then that’s what needs 
to happen.’

He added: ‘Why 
is it that nearly a third of children in the city live in households on 
low incomes? Why is it that infant mortality is almost twice the 
national average, worse than in Cuba and on a par with Latvia and Chile?

‘These are shocking 
statistics and a national disgrace. They are a testament to failure of 
corporate governance on a grand scale.

‘What
 is shocking is that this is the city council with responsibility for 
more children than any other, our second city, the largest unitary local
 authority in the country.

‘This is a city that should be nipping at London’s heels for power, status and influence.’

He implied that the council would work better to protect children if
 it was smaller, saying: 'As somebody said about the banks not so long 
ago, if they are too big to fail, they are too big. The same could be 
said about this council.

'It is an absolute disgrace and 
government needs to look at this with real urgency. If better governance
 means breaking it up so that children are better protected, then that's
 what needs to happen.'

The chief inspector spoke as Ofsted released its first report on England’s 152 children’s services departments.

Just 3 per cent of councils were rated as 'outstanding' and 86 - more than half - were deemed to be 'less than good'.

The report highlights that across 
England 700,000 children live in a home with an alcoholic parent, 
100,000 children have parents who are being treated for a hard drug 
addiction, 130,000 live in domestically violent homes and there are 
17,000 children living with a parent who has a severe or enduring mental
 illness.

Sir Michael said children’s services had been undermined because one in three departmental directors have either quit or been sacked in the past year – 50 out of 152.

‘Incompetent and ineffective leadership must be addressed quickly,’ he added. 

‘But where those in leadership positions have capacity and potential, this must be recognised and nurtured.’

The report found 86 of the 152 councils had children’s services that were ‘less than good’.

A spokesman for Birmingham council 
said: ‘We are already on record as saying that we have failed to meet the basic expectation of keeping vulnerable children in this city safe.

'This is a long-standing problem which we acknowledge and the leader has said that improving children's services is his number one priority.

'While we can only agree with the seriousness of what Sir Michael has said with regard to children's services - indeed we have said it ourselves - we now need improvement rather than further diagnosis lacking any offer of solutions.

'We must work with Ofsted on this and we repeat our determination to improve the safety of children in this city as the highest priority for this council.'

The 20 judged inadequate were Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston on Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset.
