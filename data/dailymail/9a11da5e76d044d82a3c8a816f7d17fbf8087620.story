Tragedy: Tycoon Morten Hoegh's daughter Alexandra, 3, was found hanged in her cot after getting tangled in blind cords

The daughter of one of  Britain’s richest men has died after becoming tangled in the cords of a window blind.

The three-year-old was found  in her cot at the London home  of Norwegian shipping tycoon Morten Hoegh.

Alexandra Lucy Hoegh was discovered by her mother Dana, 37, at their £12million house in West London.

Detectives are investigating but are not treating the death as suspicious.

It is thought that Alexandra was playing with the strings in her cot and became caught up, resulting in her being hanged by the cords.

Paramedics were called to the semi-detached property shortly after 2.25pm on Monday.

The toddler was taken to  hospital but pronounced dead at 3.17pm. Her American-born mother was taken to hospital  in shock.

Mr Hoegh, 39, is the chairman of Hoegh LNG, a multi-billion pound oil and gas shipping company based in Norway.

He is one of Britain’s richest men with an estimated fortune of £175million.The couple also have two other children, a six-year-old son and a daughter, five. Relatives at the family home yesterday were too upset to talk.

Shocked neighbours described the Houghs as a ‘private family’ who had lived at the property for around five years.

The increase in the number of deaths involving blind cords similar to this one has led to campaigners calling on them to be banned

‘They are a very pleasant  couple, 
very polite,’ said one resident. ‘You see them doing the school run, 
either the mother or father or the nanny, but apart from that they are 
very private.

‘People on this street tend to keep 
themselves to themselves.’ A man, who did not want to be named, said he 
was near the house when he heard screaming. He ran on to the street, 
where he saw Mrs Hoegh outside her home. He called emergency services.

‘There was nothing they  could do,’ 
he said. ‘It is an  image I cannot get out of my head, I cannot sleep. 
It is a  horrible, horrible accident.’

Safety campaigners say at least 22 
children have died in similar accidents since 1999, ten of them in the 
last two years. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents is 
campaigning for manufacturers to stop making looped blind cords, which 
they say pose an unacceptably high risk to infants.

In the meantime, it wants cords fitted with safety devices such as chain-break connections.

It advises parents against installing
blinds with cords, particularly in children’s bedrooms; to ensure any 
cords are short and out of reach; and to not hang toys on cots.
