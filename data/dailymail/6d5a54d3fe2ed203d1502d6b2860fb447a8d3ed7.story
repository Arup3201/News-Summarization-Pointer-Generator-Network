Far from being lonely at the top, people with power are happier than those without it, researchers have found.

Wielding power brings contentment and leads people to believe that they can be true to themselves.

Researchers conducted experiments to find out if holding a position of authority enhanced well-being through an increased feeling of authenticity.

Lonely at the top? Researchers found powerful employees were 26 per cent more satisfied in their job than their powerless colleagues and power can actually make people happier

Yona Kifer, of Tel Aviv University in 
Israel, and colleagues predicted that because the powerful can ‘navigate
their lives in congruence with their internal desires and 
inclinations’, they feel as if they are acting more authentically – more
like ‘themselves’ – and are therefore more content.

Their findings – published in 
Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological 
Science – revealed that  those who felt powerful at work, among friends,
or in romantic relationships were 16 per cent more satisfied with their
lives than the least powerful among the 350 participants who took part 
in the survey.

The effect was most pronounced in the 
workplace, with powerful employees 26 per cent more satisfied with their
jobs than powerless colleagues.

According to the research Bill Gates, left, and Barack Obama, right, who were named in Forbes list of World's Most Powerful People top four, will be happier because they can make decisions based on their own beliefs

The happiness discrepancy was less 
pronounced for friendships and relationships because, said the 
researchers, friendships are associated with a sense of community rather
than hierarchy, and having power in such situations is less important.

In other experiments, the team 
examined the relationship between power, feelings of authenticity, and 
general well-being, by manipulating each factor independently.

The results revealed that being in a 
position of power leads  people to feel more authentic  and ‘true to 
themselves’ by allowing their actions to more closely reflect their 
beliefs and desires.

Feelings of authenticity, in turn, enhanced 
feelings of well-being and happiness.

The findings suggested that even the 
perception of having power could lead people to live more authentic 
lives, thereby increasing their happiness and well-being.

‘By leading people to be true  to 
their desires and inclinations  – to be authentic – power leads 
individuals to experience greater happiness,’ the researchers conclude.

The team proposed that future research into power dynamics, happiness 
and authenticity should focus on specific kinds of power, both positive –
such as charisma – and negative – such as punishment.
