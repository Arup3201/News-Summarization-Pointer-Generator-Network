Kevin Ware has admitted that he was so far gone on pain medication for his surgically repaired leg that he doesn’t remember talking to Michelle Obama hours after suffering the gut-wrenching injury.

Ware sat down with the Today show on Day 2 of the star Louisville guard's media blitz after arriving with his teammates in Atlanta, where the Louisville Cardinals will take on Wichita State on Saturday.

He became a national hero and inspiration late Sunday night, when he jumped up to block a shot and came down awkwardly on his right leg, and six inches of his tibia ripped through the skin.

His story sparked a flurry of support
from all over the world including NBA basketball stars, celebrities and
even the first lady, who called Ware not long after the surgery to fix 
his leg.

When asked about the substance of 
that call, Ware said he could not recall - because he was too doped up 
on the painkillers he was taking post-surgery.

Laughing as he and his mother Lisa Junior spoke with Today's Craig Melvin: 'I was so drugged - honestly I don't know.'

Still donning his 'Win it for Kevin' t-shirt, Ware went on to say that he has not yet seen the video of his injury, and doesn't plan to in the near future.

He said: 'I haven't seen [the video]. Don't want to. I’m gonna stay as far away from that video as possible.'

He thought he had suffered only a broken ankle until he saw the look on coach Rick Pitino's face.

'Coach P's eyes gave it away. Looking at him, looking at my leg. It was automatic shock.'

But for Ware, the priority is the NCAA Championship trophy, before he begins the long road to recovery.

The Louisville guard thanked fans for their support and promised he would do his best to return to the court.

Ware admitted to a gaggle of 
reporters at the university that he did not know Louisville had gone on 
to win the game until he woke up on Monday morning, with the NCAA trophy
by his side.

His eyes watered as ESPN's Rece Davis asked him what that moment meant to him.

With tears streaming down his face, Ware told Davis: 'It meant everything to me. They went out there and did that for me.'

'Words
can’t explain. I love those guys to death. I wouldn’t trade them in for
the world.Those are the brothers I never had. And I just keep telling 
them the job ain’t done yet.'

Speaking
of the moment of the injury, he told ESPN: 'I honestly didn't feel 
pain. It was more shock. I've never felt anything like that.'
