Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina admits he is not sure where he will play next season after completing his one-year loan spell with Napoli.

Reina, who is currently training with Spain in preparation for the World Cup, has two years left on his current contract with Liverpool.

The 31-year-old was recently linked with a return to La Liga after a solid campaign with Napoli.

'Right now I'm only thinking of La Roja (Spain's national team),' Reina said to Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.

'With regards to a new club, I will first have to speak to Liverpool.

'My season on loan at Napoli has been very positive and I thank the Napoli people and the club.

'With Barcelona there is nothing, they have just acquired (German goalkeeper) Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, hence they have that role covered.

'I haven't had any contact either with Atletico Madrid, I think they will do all they can to keep (Thibaut) Courtois.

'I will return to be a Liverpool player but I think I'm not in the coaching plans.'

Reds manager Brendan Rodgers has indicated he does not see a future for Reina at Anfield.

The Spaniard made 30 league appearances to help Napoli finish third in Serie A and qualify for the Champions League.
