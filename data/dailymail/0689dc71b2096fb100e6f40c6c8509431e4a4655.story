Thomas Eric Duncan lied about his exposure to Ebola to hospital staff and to public health officials, even as he was suffering from projectile vomiting and other symptoms of the horrific disease at Texas Presbyterian, an emergency room nurse has revealed. 

Duncan initially claimed that he had not been around anyone who had died when he was in Liberia after he was admitted to the Dallas Hospital last month, Sidia Rose told '60 Minutes' on CBS.

It has since been revealed that he helped care for a pregnant woman who is believed to have died of Ebola in his native Liberia. It is believed  he contracted the illness from her.

Nurse Sidia Rose says Thomas Eric Duncan lied to her about his contact with Ebola victims - even as she cleaned up his infected bodily fluids

Authorities say that Duncan lied to airport screeners in Liberia in order to be allowed to fly from the Ebola-stricken West African nation to the United States. He died on October 8

Officials have accused Duncan of lying about his contact with Ebola in order to fly out of Liberia and into the United States. He was in Dallas for several day before he began to show symptoms of the disease.  

Ms Rose said that when she first saw Duncan he has projectile vomited on the walls of his isolation room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and was suffering from explosive diarrhea - usually the second phase of the illness.

The nurse, wearing rubber gloves and a face mask, cleaned up the bodily fluids, which contained the deadly virus.  

Still, when she asked him whether he had been in contact with anyone how had been sick when he was in Liberia, he responded: 'No. He said no,' Ms Rose told CBS. 

 

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has been widely criticized for its response to the Ebola outbreak in Dallas, though nurses who treated Duncan defended the hospital's actions

Nurses had drawn his blood and sent the samples to a lab to check for Ebola - but the results would not be due back for 48 hours.   

She followed up and asked him whether he had been in contact with anyone who had died. 

'And that's when he said to me his family had suffered a loss. That he had buried his daughter who had died in childbirth,' she said. 

However, when Texas public health officials later interviewed him, he died in own story about coming into contact with anyone who had died in Liberia. 

Nearly 4,700 people have contracted the deadly disease in Liberia and 2,700 have died - overwhelming the very poor nation's meager public health system. Doctors have still not been able to control the spread of the infection in Liberia and the other West African nations of Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Ms Rose says she had been reading about Ebola and efforts to contain the disease in Africa before Duncan was admitted. When she first went in to see Duncan, she says, she was 'very frightened.'

'I didn't allow fear to paralyze me. I got myself together. I'd done what I needed to get myself prepared mentally, emotionally, and physically, and went in there and did what I was supposed to,' she told CBS. 

Two Texas Presbyterian nurses contracted Ebola from 42-year-old Duncan while they were caring for him before his death on October 8. Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are both cured of the disease now, though their colleagues - including Ms Rose - are still nervously waiting out the 21-day incubation period.

The nurses defended the actions of the hospital, which as been widely criticized for its response to the Ebola outbreak in Dallas. They said they believed they were properly protected - to the level CDC guidelines at the time suggested - when caring for Duncan.
