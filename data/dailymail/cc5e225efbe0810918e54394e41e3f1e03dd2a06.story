Rugby bosses will on Thursday unveil a plan to tackle the threat posed by concussion. 

Players, support staff and referees in the professional game will have to complete an online course or face fines or suspensions, in what is another victory for the Mail On Sunday’s concussion campaign.

‘There will be a process of fining in place for non-completion,’ said Corin Palmer, Premier Rugby head of operations. 

All people involved in professional rugby, including players, coaches and referees, must do a new online course on concussion so everyone is on the same page for incidents such as this with Saracens' Charlie Hodgson

‘After 14 days if it is still not completed the fine will be doubled. Then the right to coach, play or indeed officiate will be taken away until they have completed it.’

Campaigners have called for medical staff to be allowed to make decisions without being pressured by coaches.

‘In the old days concussion was a badge of honour and you played on without knowing really what was wrong,’ said Harlequins director of rugby Conor O’Shea. ‘Those days are gone.’

The deadline for the online course to be completed is December 11, after which sanctions will be imposed.
