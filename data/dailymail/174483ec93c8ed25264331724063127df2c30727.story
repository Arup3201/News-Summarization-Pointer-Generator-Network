Warren Buffett is predicting that Hillary Clinton will not only run for president in 2016, but that she will also win the election.

'Hillary is going to run,' said the billionaire investor while speaking at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna
Niguel, California, earlier today.

He then went one step further, telling the audience, 'Hillary's going to win.'

Gambling man: Buffett (above) even told the audience at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit earlier today that he would 'bet money' on a Hillary win

Buffett, who is ranked by Forbes as the third-richest person in the world, even said he would 'bet money on it.'

He then added that betting money is not something he does easily. 

Speculation has swirled for years now as to whether former Secretary of State
Clinton will throw her hat into the ring for the next election. 

While she is considered a potential contender, if not the front-runner, for the job, she
herself has yet to announce her decision on running.

'She's going to announce it as late as possible,' Buffett speculated.

New job: Clinton (above with husband Bill and granddaughter Charlotte) recently became a grandmother

Buffett famously supported both President Barack Obama and Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, going to great lengths to let people know how capable and talented he believed both candidates were in a 2007 interview with The New York Times.

As for Clinton, she is enjoying another big role these days - as a grandmother.

Daughter Chelsea gave birth to her first child, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, late last month.
