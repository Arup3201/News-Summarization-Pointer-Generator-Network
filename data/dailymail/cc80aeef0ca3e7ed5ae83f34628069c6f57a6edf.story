Animal-rights campaigners have criticised Instagram for allowing users to sell unwanted pets and exotic animals online.

Some people even use the photo-sharing website to sell animals for slaughter as sacrifices at religious rituals.

Thousands of household pets such as puppies, kittens and rabbits are sold through Instagram posts with the hashtag #forsale.

Advertising: Some users have effectively turned their accounts into streams of classified ads for animals

Users can also browse through a selection of exotic animals requiring specialist care such as snakes, horses and turtles.

The adverts come in the form of photographs of the animals on sale, with details written in the captions, and can be read online through a computer or via Instagram's smartphone and tablet apps.

Searching for #forsale brings up more than 1million offerings - most are innocuous items such as clothes, shoes and jewellery, but many are live animals.

Instagram users in the Middle East run accounts selling animals such as sheep which are intended to be slaughtered.

An account based in Kuwait boasts: 'We have them all, sacrificial and carcasses of all ages. We will bring them to you for all events and birthdays.'

Animal Aid is now calling on the social media site, which is owned by Facebook, to ban this 'careless slave trading' of animals.

'This is a shocking situation to see animals being bred for money and traded like commodities,' the charity's director Andrew Tyler said.

'And this will only lead to suffering and more abuse towards animals.

'Animals are being manufactured and traded as products and this will encourage people to breed carelessly.

'The easier you make it to buy and sell animals online, the more casual and callous an approach people will take. We live in an age where people see animals as disposable and it's not right.

Unrestricted: Instagram does not currently have rules against the sale of animals on the site or app

'I urge everyone of conscience to join us and I urge Instagram not to play host to this careless, selfish and thoughtless trading of animals.

'This is a dismal development and Instagram need to recognise it as a very negative thing. It must be stopped.'

The site's terms of use do not currently contain any guidelines on the advertisement of items for sale, and do not mention the sale of animals.

By contrast, the leading online sales sites eBay and Amazon both strictly prohibit the listing and sale of live animals.

Instagram has declined to comment on the controversy.
