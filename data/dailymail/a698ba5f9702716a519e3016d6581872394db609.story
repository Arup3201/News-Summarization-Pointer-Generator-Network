De La Cruz was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'.

He was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation.

Myers was reported missing on December 18 by distraught relatives in Colorado who said her disappearance was 'out of character'.

She was last seen in in Grand Junction with friends and was believed to be heading to Salt Lake City.

Raymond Cordova, 47, an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house, the affidavit stated.

Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19.

An investigation traced her IP address to 3422 S. Decker Lake Drive in West Valley City, which is the Country Inn and Suites hotel. 

Investigators believe Myers died sometime on December 19. 

Her body was then placed in a black suitcase with a 'hard shell', an informant told police, according to The Deseret News.

De La Cruz had checked into the same hotel as Myers on the day she is believed to have died,police say.

The informant told investigators that he got into a car with Cordova and the suitcase.

He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'.

They then drove to Cactus Park - a hotspot for four-wheel truck drivers performing stunts - where they disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states.

On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. 

She described 'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. 

It was said as 'the smell as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states.

Myers' body was then located on February 28.  

The official cause of death has not been released. 

An autopsy has been completed. 

Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail as of Tuesday for investigation of drug-related charges.

Myers also had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine.  

Police initially believed Myers had fled Colorado for Utah.

Search: Myers went missing December 18, when family thought she had hitchhiked to friends in Utah

A search team was not sent out until January 19.

Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City. 

'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time. 

According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, Myers worked at Abra Formal Wear and attended Central High School.

A friend commented on her Facebook page: 'With a heavy heart I have to inform all my family and friends that they have found our sweet Kelly. Thank you to all who shared her information while she was missing. I only wish she had been found alive and well. We love you Kell Smell and I hope you sleep with the Angels and find peace.'
