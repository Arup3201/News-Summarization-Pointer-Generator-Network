A set of extremely rare identical triplets have been born in Indiana, defying one-in-100-million genetic odds.

Triplet girls Avery, Cassidy and Bentley Doss were born on Monday at St. Vincent Women’s Hospital in Indianapolis without assisted fertility treatment.

Parents Chad and Amanda Doss from Franklin have become one of several sets of parents to make headlines for giving birth to identical triplets this year after couples in the UK and America welcomed trios to their families.

Come in threes: Avery, Bentley and Cassidy - born on December 30 - defied the one-in-100-million genetic odds

Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception because the babies shared a placenta and chorionic sac but had their own amniotic sacs.

The odds of producing identical triplets without fertility drugs range from one-in-one-million to one-in-100-million according to various experts. The rarity makes it difficult to accurately calculate the frequency of such births.

Mrs Doss gave birth at 31 weeks just three months after a routine ultrasound revealed that she was carrying three babies.

A
 year ago, Mr Doss – who has two children, aged nine and 12 from a 
previous marriage – had a vasectomy procedure reversed as the couple 
starting trying for their own baby.

According to the Indy Star, Mrs Doss said: ‘It was just crazy to see three babies in three beds sitting here and doing well.

‘Seeing
 them for the first time was a very overwhelming experience, to feel 
them in my stomach for so long and just wonder what they will look like 
so to finally be able to see them was the best day ever.’

After more than a month’s bed rest, Mrs Doss was admitted to hospital in early December. There she felt contractions but progress was slow until Monday when her waters broke around midday. Within an hour she had given birth to three baby girls.

She said: ‘It was definitely just like in the blink of an eye that it happened.’

Avery, who was born weighing 3lbs 15on, and Bentley, born 4lbs 3on, can be held by their parents while Cassidy, who weighs 3lbs 11on, still requires of feeding tube through her umbilical cord.While Mrs Doss was discharged today, the babies are likely to remain in hospital for the next eight weeks.

The couple have traded in their two cars to purchase a minivan for their suddenly big family. 

In November Hannah and Tom Hepner, of Quincy, California gave birth to a rare set of naturally conceived identical triplets at Sutter Memorial Hospital.

Laura and Kevin Stier, of West Allis, Wisconsin weren’t even trying to get pregnant when they conceived their triplets, giving birth in October with their three babies having a collective body weight of less than 7lbs.
