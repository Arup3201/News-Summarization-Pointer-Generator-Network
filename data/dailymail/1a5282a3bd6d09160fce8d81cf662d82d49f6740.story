STUFFOCATION

by James Wallman

(Penguin, £9.99) 

Do you have too much stuff? Of course you do. Everybody has, and many of us are about to pop out to the shops and buy some more.

Shopping has become what people do for fun when they can’t think of anything else to do. And what do you get for it? A massive credit card bill, a pair of shoes that looked nicer in the shop and a horrible feeling at the back of your mind that there’s got to be more to life than this.

Stuffocation by James Wallman

And there is, says James Wallman, there really is!

Wallman isn’t the first writer to tell us that retail therapy is no kind of therapy at all — Oliver James has done so memorably in Affluenza and other books. But something about this one feels particularly timely.

Maybe it’s because it’s January, the month of regret. Or maybe the tide really is turning against the tyranny of having too much stuff. Wallman, who calls himself a ‘trend analyst’, begins with a description of one of those men who has successfully banished stuff from his life.

You know the type: no paintings on the walls, no books on the shelves, no shelves to have books on. Just a bed, a few clothes, a laptop and an insufferable smugness that makes you want to spike his mug of rooibos tea.

But some people will always go too far in any direction.

Wallman believes that stuffocation afflicts us all to some extent. Which of us doesn’t have a drawer in a cupboard somewhere that is full of bits of string and old batteries and other bits of rubbish that ‘might come in handy’?

When our cupboards can take no more, we’ll hire storage space before we get rid of it.

As Wallman reports, ‘the average British woman now buys 58 items of clothing each year. There are twice as many things in her wardrobe today as there were in her equivalent’s wardrobe in 1980. There are 22 things in there she has never worn.’

(It’s even worse in America, where they buy a new item of clothing, on average, every four or five days; they buy 279 million toasters a year, for heaven’s sake.)

Instead of materialism, Wallman believes we should favour what he calls ‘experientialism’, by which he means doing things, having experiences, using our minds and bodies and souls, and not just watching the TV.

Who can disagree? Stuffocation is effectively his manifesto for a better, fuller life, based on ‘the absolute imperative that happiness is more likely to come from the enjoyment of experiences rather than the accumulation of stuff’.

And he argues it well, if sometimes a little glibly, in the manner of someone who has written a lot of marketing documents.

Wallman reports, ‘the average British woman now buys 58 items of clothing each year. There are twice as many things in her wardrobe today as there were in her equivalent’s wardrobe in 1980. There are 22 things in there she has never worn.’

The very slight problem with ‘experientialism’ is that you still need money for it. The best things in life really aren’t free, and the wonderful holidays he seems to suggest we all take aren’t on the menu for most of us.

I sense that he’s mainly writing for an American readership (most of the examples he gives are American, although Wallman himself isn’t) and for bored businessmen on planes.

Nor am I entirely convinced that materialism is quite as washed-up as he would like it to be. Anyone who went to Argos in the week before Christmas knows that the British are addicted to shopping, dangerously so in some cases.

My son wanted a Playstation 4 because all his friends were getting one, which immediately rendered his Playstation 3 obsolete and surplus to requirements.

In other words, the manufacturers have him — and, therefore, me — exactly where they want us: within their grasp and being squeezed for every penny.

So rather than forecasting, there’s an element of wishful thinking to this book.

But why not? Even if he does occasionally write like a Dalek, I think Wallman is fundamentally right. Too many of us are working too hard in jobs we don’t enjoy in order to earn money to buy things we don’t need or want. There has to be a better way.

And he is spot on about the clutter. Indeed, it’s quite hard to read his book without looking round your home wondering what you can get rid of.

Staring up at my own overloaded bookshelves, I realised it might be time for another visit to Oxfam.

I’ll probably keep his book, though. Might come in handy.
