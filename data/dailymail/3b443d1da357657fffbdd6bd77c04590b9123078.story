A female prosecutor has turned the courthouse in a small Texas town into a fortress as she investigates who shot dead her boss, his wife and a co-worker in a series of planned attacks which some fear are the work of a violent white supremacist gang.

Brandi Fernandez, 42, has surrounded the Kaufman County Law Enforcement Center with armed police officers after Mike 
McLelland, the county's district attorney, and his wife Cynthia were shot dead at their home in Forney on Saturday.

Miss Fernandez, backed by her boss Mr McLelland, was responsible for prosecuting a senior member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas last year who received two life terms following a shoot out.

Courage: Brandi Fernandez, newly-named interim district attorney in Kaufman County, Texas has had security on high alert for all staff following the shooting

On guard: The Kaufman County Law Enforcement Center was protected by armed guards on Tuesday as the interim DA took up her position

Army veteran Mike McLelland, 63, and his 65-year-old wife, reportedly died from multiple gunshot wounds at their ranch set on one acre last weekend.

Their violent deaths follow the gunning down of assistant district attorney Mark Hasse at the Kaufman courthouse parking lot on January 31.

The investigations into their deaths was the primary concern of Miss Fernandez, named interim DA, as she slipped into the Kaufman County Courthouse for her first full day on Tuesday.

Praised as a smart, tough litigator and a fierce advocate for child victims of crime, Fernandez declined to address reporters and remained under close protection inside the courthouse throughout the day.

A police cruiser was parked outside her single-family home surrounded by trees on Monday and Tuesday.

As first assistant district attorney under McLelland, Fernandez, 42, was named to the interim job on Monday, after having worked in the office for nearly a decade.

Miss Fernandez began her role with the news that assistant DA Jay Hileman had walked off the large racketeering case  involving the Aryan Brotherhood on Tuesday.

He reportedly sent a short email to the defense team on the case saying that he was stepping down for security reasons, according to Dallas News.

A climate of fear has descended on Kaufman, an affluent town of around 7,000 people on the edge of Dallas' city limits, following the hits.

The Aryan Brotherhood, a violent gang of 'generals' who often dictate orders from jail, is suspected of 
being behind the assassinations.

However no evidence has tied the 
gang to the slayings and no one has been arrested over the deaths.

The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas has been in the state's prison system since the 1980s, when it began as a white supremacist gang to retaliate against black and Latino gangs.

It protected its members and ran illegal activities, including drug distribution, according to Terry Pelz, a former Texas prison warden and expert on the gang.

The group, which has a long history of violence and retribution, is now believed to have more than 4,000 members in and out of prison who deal in a variety of criminal enterprises, including prostitution, robbery and murder.

It has a paramilitary structure with five factions around the state. Each faction has a general, who is part of a steering committee known as the Wheel, which controls all criminal aspects of the gang, according to court papers.

Four top leaders of the group were indicted in October for crimes ranging from murder to drug trafficking. At the time, prosecutors called the 
indictments 'a devastating blow to the leadership' of the gang. Pelz 
said the indictments might have fragmented the gang's leadership.

Two months later, authorities issued the bulletin warning that the gang might try to retaliate against law enforcement for the investigation that also led to the arrest of 30 other members.

Killing law enforcement representatives would be uncharacteristic of the group, Pelz said.

'They don't go around killing officials. They don't draw heat upon themselves,' he said.

But Pelz, who worked in the Texas prison system for 21 years, said the gang has a history of threatening officials and of killing its own members or rivals. 

Dozens of federal agents have descended on Kaufman looking for answers.

Kaufman police instigated a crackdown on the Brotherhood late last year with 34 alleged members arrested.

The McLellands were murdered less than two weeks after Colorado's prison 
chief was shot to death on his doorstep, allegedly by an ex-convict.

Many members of the Texas legal community have increased 
their security details.

Harris
 County District Attorney Mike Anderson now has round-the-clock 
protection for him and his family after the assassinations. His district
 includes Houston.

Law 
enforcement agencies throughout Texas have been on high alert, and steps
 were being taken to better protect other DAs and their staffs.

Anderson said he also would take precautions at his office, the largest of its kind in Texas, with more than 270 prosecutors.

'I think district attorneys across Texas are still in a state of shock,' Anderson said on Sunday.

Mr McLelland, 63, was the 13th prosecutor
 killed in the U.S. since the 1960s.

Kaufman
 County Sheriff David Byrnes said there was nothing to indicate for certain 
whether the murders were connected to Mr Hasse's shooting.

In Colorado, sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Joe Roybal said 
investigators had so far found no evidence connecting the Texas killings
 to the Colorado case, but added: 'We're examining all possibilities.'

Colorado's
 corrections director Tom Clements was killed on March 19 when he 
answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs.

Evan
 Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected 
of shooting Clements, died in a shootout with Texas deputies two days 
later about 100 miles from Kaufman.

In
 an interview shortly after the Colorado slaying, Mr McLelland raised 
the possibility that Mr Hasse was gunned down by a white supremacist 
gang.

McLelland, elected in 2010, said his 
office had prosecuted several cases against such gangs, particularly one
 known as the Aryan Brotherhood.

The
 groups have a strong presence around Kaufman County, a mostly rural 
area dotted with subdivisions, with a population of about 104,000.

After Hasse's slaying, Mr McLelland said that he carried a gun everywhere around town even when walking his dog.

He
 figured assassins were more likely to try to attack him outside. He 
said he had warned all his employees to be constantly on the alert.

'The
 people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he 
said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more 
in the future.'
