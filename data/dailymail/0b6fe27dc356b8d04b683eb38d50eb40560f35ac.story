Whatever you have going on between midday and 4pm today - make sure you block out 15 minutes in your diary to cuddle up to an adorably irresistible fluffy kitten.

It's a win-win for animal lovers as not only will you be able to take your mind off work momentarily but you are also giving to a very worthy charity - and all for just $40.

Ride sharing app Uber has teamed up with six animal shelters across the country to deliver the fluffy felines to your office or front doorstep.

Whatever you have going on between midday and 4pm today - make sure you block out 15 minutes in your diary to cuddle up to an adorably irresistible fluffy kitten

All you have to do is download the app and request the kitten button to get some invaluable cat love to brighten up your day. 

The service will be benefitting the Animal Service League of Queensland for donations gathered in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, 

The Lort Smith Adoption Centre will receive the Geelong and Melbourne donations while Cat Haven in Perth, and the Cat Protection Society for Sydney will benrfit from the much-needed funds.

The sniggle initiative comes just months after Uber got slammed for a price surge during Sydney's cafe siege in December.

If the scheme takes off as planned there will be more Aussies cuddling up to kitties at home with millions of neglected animals in desperate need of good homes.

So if you can't bear parting with your little ball of fluff after just quarter of an hour - have a chat to the animal shelter representative who will be on hand during your exclusive cuddle time.

The U.S. service, which also runs a similar puppy initiative, saw six precious pussies adopted to loving families.

As the promo video says - press the button and say 'awwww'.

You know you want to and your colleagues will be your best friend - for at least 15 minutes anyway.
