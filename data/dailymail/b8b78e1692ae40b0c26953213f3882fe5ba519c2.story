A raunchy restaurant in Japan is using scantly-clad female robots instead of real life women to dance for its customers.

Revellers pay 23,000 Yen (£25) a time to enjoy the adult entertainment provided by the 'fembots' at the venue.

The statuesque 12ft machines are controlled by women wearing an equally small amount of clothes at the bizarre Robot Restaurant in Tokyo's Shinjuku Kabukicho red light district.

Scantily-clad: Robot Restaurant uses statuesque machines instead of real life women to dance for customers

Adult entrainment: The robots are controlled by real-life woman inside a dining room covered by neon lights

Long awaited: The restaurant, which serves alcoholic drinks and tea, was three years under construction

Customers can also jump onto a robot's lap and have a go at controlling the machine themselves.

The strange entertainment attracts men and women from a wide age range, who can enjoy the bikini-wearing robots with a tea or alcoholic drink.

The venue cost a reported 10 million yen (£70 million) to build. The robots are based on the character Valkyrie from the video game Soul Calibur.

The unusual sight should come as no surprise however, with Japan responsible for more than 50 per cent of the world's robot production.

The restaurant also boasts a nightly cabaret that include girls dancing, marching, riding around on motorbikes and in a tank.

Adding to the hallucinatory experience are the  eye-popping LEDs and neon lights, which cover every inch of the dining room.

To advertise the new endeavour, the Amazonian robots were recently paraded around the streets of the country's capital.

The restaurant serves sushi as well as alcoholic drinks and tea. Its doors opened last summer after three years under construction.
