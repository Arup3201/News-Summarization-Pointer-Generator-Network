The Football Association will wait on referee Mike Dean's report before deciding whether to take action against Steve Bruce or Gus Poyet for their touchline spat on Tuesday night.

Dean's report is due in to the FA on Wednesday, meaning if action is taken against the Hull and Sunderland managers it will be announced on Thursday at the earliest.

Sunderland boss Poyet has refused to apologise for the behaviour which saw him sent off during the 1-1 draw at the KC Stadium.

Things turned sour when Bruce and Poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart

Poyet was dismissed for kicking over a cooler box before clashing on the touchline with Bruce.

The rival bosses were only kept apart by the assistant referee and both could face further sanction should the FA investigate the clash which was sparked when Poyet sarcastically applauded in Bruce’s face.

But the Uruguayan blamed Dean for his reaction after he booked Jack Rodwell for diving.

Poyet said: ‘Kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious.

‘I was not happy with Paul McShane (Hull defender) dancing like he was in the theatre, or like he’d been shot, and won a free-kick before that.

‘Jack then dived and got a free-kick against him, I just want fairness.

‘I have no regrets whatsoever. I now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me.’ 

Jack Rodwell appeals for a foul but is booked for diving, a decision that led to Poyet's reaction

The two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other

Poyet's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined £25,000 by the FA after six of their players were booked, including Lee Cattermole who picked up a two-game ban following his 10th yellow of the season.

Bruce, meanwhile, did not reveal what Poyet had said to provoke his furious reaction. But he admitted it had been unsavoury.

‘I think it’s right that I keep what he said to myself,’ he said. ‘But it wasn’t very pleasant. It wasn’t “have a nice evening, Steve”. 

‘But I don’t know why I reacted like that. We all do stupid things but it was handbags.

‘I thank the assistant referee for stepping in. I’ll have to buy him a beer.

‘I just think Gus had seen it differently about Rodwell diving. But the referee got it right.

‘All I said to his assistant was that Rodwell had dived.

‘These things happen in the heat of the moment. Grown men acting like a couple of children. They happen in big games. Let’s forget about it and go and have a glass of wine.’ 

Poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game

The result moves Hull five points clear of the relegation zone with Sunderland a point behind.

And Bruce said: ‘We’re making a fist of it and I would say that is a point gained. We’re six clear of the relegation zone now if you take into account our goal difference.

‘We have to remember it’s our second season in the league. For Sunderland they’ve been there for eight.’

Dame N’Doye opened the scoring in the first half before Rodwell levelled late on, although the ball appeared to go in via his arm.

Bruce said: ‘I didn’t see it to be honest, but if Rodwell has said he handled it then I suppose he did. These things happen.’
