A new designer fragrance containing notes of asphalt and pollution has been created by fashion label Comme des Garçons.

The unisex scent, which will retail for £56 at the label’s Dover Street Market, was designed to mark the opening of the Serpentine Gallery’s new wing.

An homage to the gallery’s Hyde Park location, the scent boasts notes of grass, leaves, pollen, oxygen, asphalt, and ‘a little bit of pollution,’ according to Dover Street Market’s website.

City smell: Comme des Garcons's new Serpentine fragrance includes notes of 'pollution'

The term ‘pollution’ is of course 
figurative in this case.  Comme des Garçons has used the distilled essences of 
juniper wood, gaiac wood, and benzoin (a tree resin) to evoke London’s 
city smell.

Similarly, the label has mixed a variety of black musks and nutmeg to create an asphalt-type scent.

Serpentine comes bottled and boxed in packaging designed by Tracey Emin. The
 artist’s famous handwriting adorns the bottle in a silver script that 
reads: ‘The Grass, The Trees, The Lake, And You.’

While she has previously created everything from beach towels to dog bowls, Serpentine marks her first perfume-related project.

Ms Emin explained to The New York Times of her concept behind the bottle's quote: ‘I did it from a completely artistic point of view. I’ve always wanted to have a romantic rendezvous at the galleries — in those first days of spring when it’s warm and hazy and really sensual with the blossoms on the trees and the fresh-cut grass.’

A sketch of Ms Emin’s new sculpture The Hearts Has Its Reasons - which was created for the Serpentine’s new wing –  is inscribed on the inside of the fragrance’s box.

Taking inspiration: The Serpentine Galleries, located in Hyde Park, have just welcomed the addition of The Sackler Gallery - a Zaha Hadid-designed structure

The Serpentine’s newest exhibition space, The Sackler Gallery, was created by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid. It opened in September 2013.

It was built with contributions from the Sackler family foundation -  a well-known arts benefactor that has funded projects including the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Sackler wing, an Egyptian arts hall that houses the famous Temple of Dendur.
