The challenge came about when owner Dean Hawkins was approached by breakfast radio hosts Mike Bryne and Marie T from the local station River 94.9 - they couldn't decide which one to purchase 

Mr Hawkins, a self confessed Holden lover, said the challenge was sure to be hard but he was ready to take it on

'Marie's partner was looking at buying a new vehicle but he couldn't decide between a Ford Falcon or a Holden Commodore - they asked me what I thought and if we could put the two together,' Mr Hawkins told Daily Mail Australia. 

Mr Hawkins, a self confessed Holden lover, said the challenge was sure to be hard but he was ready to take it on.

'We made a plan on how we were going to do it, made a schedule and away we went.'

He said he knew of other auto wreckers who had tried to combine cars together.

'Others have cut cars  and just attached the front and back of two different vehicles but we actually got the two cars and cut them down the middle.

'We worked out how to cut them, got it wielded, got the  paint and added the stickers.'

The red and blue Falcodore is literally half Ford and Holden, with an engine made from a Ford Falcon motor, a Holden gear box and a Falcon diff.

The savvy car developer was amazed at how fast it took his team to create the Falcodore.

'I had six people working on it at different times and it only took us about four weeks to build which is pretty good,' Mr Hawkins said.  

'The result was great - I thought it was excellent.'  

As for Marnie's partner Mr Hawkins said he was blown away with the innovative Falcodore.

'It was built because he was undecided and once he saw it he loved it - he wanted to take it home,' he said. 

Mr Hawkins said the Falcodore can be driven, but unfortunately for Marnie's partner driving his ultimate car is not an option. 

'The car works - it can drive but it can't be registered which means we can't even drive it across the road.'
