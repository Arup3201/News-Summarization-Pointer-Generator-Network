Ashley Cole has revealed he gave up smoking after being caught out having a puff on holiday - and appealed for Jack Wilshere to think about doing the same.

Cole was reprimanded by Jose Mourinho after being photographed with a cigarette on holiday to America last year.

In a case of history repeating itself, Wilshere has been heavily criticised after pictures of him drinking and smoking at a pool party with England team-mate Joe Hart in Las Vegas were published on Tuesday, just a fortnight after England’s elimination from the World Cup.

Cole, now 33, insisted the occasional cigarette had not affected his form on the football pitch but said it was something that Wilshere who is a decade younger needed to consider.

The former Arsenal, Chelsea and England defender, who has just signed for Italian club Roma, said: ‘Everyone talks about footballers having to be professional and be an example, but we don’t know if the smoking affects him (Wilshere)

‘Of course I am not condoning smoking. We don’t want smoking. I have smoked before, I have stopped.

‘It didn’t really affect me the way I run but of course it’s not a good thing to do in public. But he is a young lad and he will learn.’

Cole smiled at the suggestion of giving the Arsenal youngster some direct advice: ‘I don’t think it is up to me to tell anyone what to do. I am not the prefect guy,’ said Cole.

‘I am not going to give him advice on how to behave. It is down to him to sort out.’
