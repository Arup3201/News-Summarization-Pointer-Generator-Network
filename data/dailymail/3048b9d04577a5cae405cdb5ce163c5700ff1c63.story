Bernie Ecclestone has no doubt Formula One will be making its debut in Russia in early October.

Earlier this week FIA race director Charlie Whiting gave the Sochi Autodrom circuit the green light to stage the inaugural event that runs from October 10-12.

There have, however, been calls for F1 to boycott Russia in light of the ongoing conflict in Crimea between pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine.

Sanctions were imposed against Russia by Western allies, with Russia retaliating by banning food imports from the West.

Politicians have been looking to F1 to make a stand against Russia, but the sport has long maintained it does not involve itself in politics.

On his return to the F1 paddock on Friday for the first time since the resolution of his trial in Munich earlier this month, supremo Ecclestone made clear there would be no pull out.

Speaking at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit ahead of this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, Ecclestone said: 'We have a contract.

'Our friends there are happy with the contract, we are happy. We will be there.

'If people have arguments with Russia, maybe they have, but we haven't got any.'

As far as Ecclestone was concerned, the discussion on Russia merely signaled it was business as usual for the 83-year-old who has run F1 for almost four decades.

Standing accused: Ecclestone agreed a settlement of $100million (£60million) to end his bribery trial

Such control, however, came under severe threat with the trial that could have resulted in him being imprisoned for 10 years if found guilty.

Charged with bribery of a German banker and incitement to breach of trust, the case was brought to a conclusion three months early with Ecclestone agreeing a settlement of $100million (£60million).
