Bersant Celina proved the hero for Manchester City's Under 21 side as the young Norwegian came off the bench to grab the winner for his team at Hyde's Ewen Fields ground.

Dominic Solanke gave Chelsea a dream start when he fired past City goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the third minute, but goals from Brandon Barker and Thierry Ambrose secured a 2-1 lead for the home side heading into the break. 

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini was present in the stands and would have been impressed with what he saw in the first 45 minutes.

Solanke completed his brace in the 68th minute to level matters once more with Nathan Ake and Ruben Loftus-Cheek impressing in midfield for the young Blues. 

The game looked to be heading to a stalemate, but Celina, who replaced Barker in the 75th minute, had other ideas.

The 17-year-old forward exchanged passes with the outstanding Oliver Ntcham to fire past Blues goalkeeper Mitchell Beeney to secure victory.

Patrick Vieira's side now move above Chelsea at the top of U21 Premier League table. They now have a two-point cushion over their rivals.
