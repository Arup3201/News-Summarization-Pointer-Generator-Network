A three-year-old British boy is believed to have died in Shanghai after being hit by a falling screen in a Turkish restaurant.

The little boy, who also held a Turkish passport, was killed at around 9pm last night at the Kervan restaurant in the Bund area of the city.

He was said to have been dining at the restaurant with his parents and family friends.

The death of a British national in Shanghai was confirmed by the UK consulate in the city, a report in the Telegraph said.

The little boy, who has not been named, was 'struck by a screen that fell', according to a report in Chinese newspaper the Shanghai Daily.

Witnesses told the newspaper the toddler might have accidentally touched the screen - often used to divide dining areas in restaurants in China - before it fell on him.

The circumstances surrounding the boy's death are not believed to be being treated as suspicious.

The report said the little boy had been 'rushed away for treatment', but a doctor from Shanghai's Huangpu District Central Hospital said he 'did not have a heartbeat' when he was brought in last night.

An employee at the restaurant today confirmed the incident, and said the boy's mother was nearby when it happened, but did not elaborate further.
