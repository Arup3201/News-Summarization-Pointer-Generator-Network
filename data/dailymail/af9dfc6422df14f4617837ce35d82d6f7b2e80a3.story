The father of Ashya King yesterday claimed British authorities threatened to remove his son for 11 years after he challenged doctors over his treatment.

Brett King said he fled abroad with his wife and seriously ill child after being warned that the youngster would be taken away until he was 16 with no contact with his parents or siblings.

He made the claim as his son was stretchered out of a pioneering cancer treatment centre in the Czech Republic clutching a teddy bear after doctors found no immediate signs of cancer regrowth since recent surgery on his brain tumour.

Five-year-old Ashya leaves the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague clutching a teddy bear after doctors found no immediate signs of cancer regrowth since the most recent surgery on his tumour 

British doctors opposed the plan to take Asha to the Prague clinic, saying it was not suitable for his condition, but the family disagreed and sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from hospital without permission and took him to the continent.

Mr King said: ‘They said to me if I question anything and ask questions as a father…they would take my son away from me, not just for the treatment but until he was 16.

‘I wouldn’t be able to see my son for 11 years.

‘I said to my wife this is something so serious that our son could be taken away until he is 16.

‘Eleven years without us, he wouldn’t know his parents, his brothers, his sisters or anyone.

‘We knew we couldn’t let that happen.

‘We couldn’t question them any more. We couldn’t let them know our feelings because one mistake on our side and they’d take him away.’

His father Brett King speaks to the media after leaving the specialist treatment centre in the Czech Republic 

Inside he spoke to doctors in a planning room where the preparations for his treatment were discussed 

Ashya’s parents removed him from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of doctors late last month and took him to Southern Spain where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment.

University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the King family was threatened.

After being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a Spanish jail for three nights.

They were released following a public outcry and reunited with Ashya who had been removed and put into a hospital in Malaga.

This week they succeeded in transferring him to Prague where he is due to start full treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre next week.

As part of the preparations he was yesterday put under general anaesthetic and measured for a specialist cocoon pouch and had an MRI scan.

Ashya previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 July and a further operation on his brain on 22 August.

Mr King said outside the Prague clinic: ‘The good news is that there is no visible signs that he has any regrowth of cancer.

‘We will find out in the next couple of days with a spinal tap if there is any microscopic cancer in his fluids, but we are hoping not.’

He said the proton beam machine his son would be treated with looked like ‘something like Nasa’.

Ashya’s parents had opposed the British doctors plans for traditional radiotherapy, preferring proton treatment which they believe is more accurate and has fewer side-effects.

Mr King and his wife Naghemeh were warned that their son could have been taken away from them for 11 years if they questioned any decisions made by the authorities 

Mr King said: ‘As a father I was not prepared for any other treatment, treatment that would be so strong it would be worse than the illness itself. I have complete confidence here that they will give my son the best possible start. This is all we wanted for him from the beginning.

‘If a child needs treatment they should give them the treatment. It’s not for the parents to say the hospital should do it.’

Portsmouth City Council have offered support to the family to help educate the couple’s other school age children who are currently still in Spain while their parents look after Ashya.

Mr King said: ‘I don’t want to get into any more trouble for my children being out of school.

‘We have told the English authorities that they are not being schooled in England and that we are exploring other avenues of either going to school here in Prague or in Spain.’
