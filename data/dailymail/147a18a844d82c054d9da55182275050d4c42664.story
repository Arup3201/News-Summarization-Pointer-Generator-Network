A bride who has been paralyzed from the waist down since the age of 17 has kept the vow she made when she first learned she was disabled, and walked down the aisle at her wedding at the weekend.

While most brides would be fussing about the last minute details in the days before their wedding, for Stevie Beale, from Toledo, Ohio, her focus was solely on whether she would be able to make it down the aisle.

Waiting for her at the other end was 32-year-old Jared VanAusdale, who she credits with bringing her 'back to life'.

'I was trying not to bawl like a baby in
front of 300 people. Seeing her on the walker, reaching that
goal that she swore she was going to hit, is something I will never 
forget,' her husband said.

Ms Beale lost all feeling from her belly button down after being involved in a car crash when she was in her junior year at high school, according to NBC Today.

The former softball player and gymnastics coach broke her back and severed her spinal cord after the car she was in crashed into a tree at 76mph, killing the driver, Charlie, who was Ms Beale's best friend.

The accident, caused after the teenagers were chased by a driver after one of the passengers threw a plastic bottle at a car, left Ms Beale feeling her life was over before it had begun.

'I thought I was doomed to my parents' 
house, to never have a boyfriend or never get married,' she said. 'I 
thought I was going to sit at home and rot away.'

However, Ms Beale's life took a step in the right direction when her parents put her in touch with a therapy 
center in Detroit, Michigan that focused on spinal cord 
recovery work. 

'The first appointment I had there was amazing because for the first time in six months people were looking at me as Stevie. Not that girl in a chair or Stevie, who got in that car accident.'

While she was there, Ms Beale met others who had similar injuries to her own, and who were living fulfilling lives.

The 24-year-old starting making contact with people who had suffered similar experiences, which soon led her to her future husband.

While she was visiting 16-year-old Bri Mullinger, who had lost a leg and her best friend after being hit by a train, Ms Beale was introduced to Mr VanAusdale, who was a family friend.

The couple hit it off immediately and soon Mr VanAusdale revealed he was falling for her.

Ms Beale was cautious at first, but finally decided to give their relationship a try, saying: 'I’m glad I did. I always tell him that he gave me the 
ability to enjoy life again and makes me continue to want to work hard.'

Her husband said: 'She could’ve felt sorry for herself. Instead she grabbed that situation by the horns, 
turned a negative into a positive and helped so many people along the 
way.'

He added: 'I never really saw her being in a chair
as a challenge just because if she was not in a chair, we would have 
challenges in other aspects ... every couple goes through challenges.'

After getting engaged while on vacation in Hawaii, the couple started to plan their wedding, which had a few special requirements, such as a tiled floor for her wheelchair.

The couple settled on the Toledo railway station for their wedding, which Ms Beale said was 'exactly what I wanted'.

From the start of their wedding planning, Mr VanAusdale encouraged his fiancee to attend physiotherapy sessions three times a week to help her achieve her goal, and helped her through the low points when she felt like giving up.

'It never really got easier, I just got better at it,' Ms Beale told ABC13, adding that the process of learning to walk again for her wedding was a low and painful one.

The moment she walked down the aisle was emotional for Ms Beale, her husband and her family.

'It was a day of pride for how hard 
she’s worked to get down the aisle and to even emotionally prepare 
herself for the rest of her life,' her mother, Sheryl, told NBC Today. 'I felt nothing but pride and joy.'

Now she has achieved her ambition walk down the aisle, Ms Beale has her sights set on completing a master's in counseling so she can help teenagers who have experienced traumatic events.
