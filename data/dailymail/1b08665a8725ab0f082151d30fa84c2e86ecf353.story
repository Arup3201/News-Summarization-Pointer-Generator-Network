David Jubb, the artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre, said he was 'overwhelmed' by public generosity after a fire ripped through the Grade II listed building last night

The 'heartbroken' artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre said he was overwhelmed by public generosity after a fire ripped through the Grade II listed building last night.

Donations began flooding in as soon as news broke that the 120-year-old arts building was on fire at just after 4.15pm yesterday, which engulfed the roof and destroyed the Grand Hall and Lower Hall.

Nearly 1,000 people have now given money to an appeal set up by the charity National Funding Scheme which has raised more than £22,000 in just 24 hours.

More than 80 firefighters battled to bring the blaze under control, some fighting the fire from above using aerial platform ladders.  

Billowing black smoke was seen for miles around the theatre while there were reports of people watching on in tears as flames engulfed the tower at the top of the centre, which then collapsed.

London Fire Brigade were able to save half of the building, including the 'priceless' octagonal dome, and salvage artwork from the centre, while some crews remained at the scene yesterday damping down hot spots.

The centre reopened parts of the building  undamaged by fire for performances last night.

Battersea's artistic director David Jubb said: 'The most important thing' was that nobody was hurt in the fire.

'It's heartbreaking. But we will get through this. Brick by brick.

'Huge thanks are owed to all the emergency services, who literally saved the front half of the building, to staff, artists and volunteers at Battersea Arts Centre, and to everyone who has shown their overwhelming support online over the last 24 hours.

'The passion for the building and the organisation is extraordinary. Thank you all for being part of this. We really need you at this time.'

The cause of the fire is unclear but investigators were continuing to sift through the ashes yesterday to look for clues.

Station Manager Matt Burrows, who visited the scene, said: 'Firefighters did a great job to save large parts of the building including the octagonal dome which I'm told is priceless and salvaged valuable art work.

'The centre are hopeful that they will be able to open unaffected areas of the building to the public today. We'll continue to damp down and our fire investigators are inspecting the building to find the cause.'

'Firefighters are working with a number of water jets around the building to contain the fire.'  

Twelve fire engines and around 80 firefighters were called to tackle the fire Battersea Arts Centre with two aerial appliances - similar to cherry pickers - used to fight the fire from above.

'Crowds had started to gather. There were two ladies outside with tears in their eyes. I heard one saying 'Please save it' as more firemen arrived.

'It is an institution, not just for Battersea, but for the whole of the city of London. It is hugely popular so this fire will affect a lot of people. The back of the building was under renovation.'

There was an outpouring of grief on Twitter as people expressed their horror yesterday at losing part of the Arts Centre.

Dan Price tweeted: 'So sad. London Fire fighting bravely to save Battersea Arts. Everyone is out safely.'

Baylen Leonard wrote on Twitter: ' Awful news about fire at Battersea Arts Centre, one of the most innovative and forward thinking arts centres in UK.'

Louise Allen-Jones posted: ' Devastated to hear Battersea Arts Centre is on fire. Love that building so much.' 

One twitter user said: 'Tower on the top of Battersea Arts Centre has just collapsed. People in tears. Police moving people back.' 

James Phillips added: 'The Battersea Arts Centre fire is apparently contained but large parts of the Grand Hall (which survived the Blitz) are gone. A tragic loss.' 

The building, which was designed in 1891 by E. W. Mountforcentre, was originally opened in 1893 as Battersea Town Hall. The space was converted to a community arts centre in 1974.
