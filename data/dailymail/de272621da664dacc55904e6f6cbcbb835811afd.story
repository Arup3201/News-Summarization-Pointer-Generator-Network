Jose Mourinho was seething after a decision to send off Branislav Ivanovic led to Chelsea conceding a last-minute equaliser at Manchester United.

The Blues had been leading through Didier Drogba's header but Ivanovic's foul on Angel di Maria saw the defender sent off for two bookable offences, and from the stoppage time free-kick, Robin van Persie slammed home.

The result kept Chelsea's gap at the top of the Barclays Premier League to four points and Mourinho said afterwards: 'We have a little space now for our mistakes... or for referees' mistakes.

Jose Mourinho gestures to the fourth official following Manchester United's equaliser

‘If I say what is in my heart, I will get in trouble. I prefer not to talk about this (Ivanovic incident), we had many things go against us, the result was not so good but acceptable.

'I'm very happy my team played a fantastic game, it's not easy to play against a Man United team that plays very compact and on the counter attack.

'We could score a couple more goals, especially the Hazard one. I am proud of my players though.

'He was not even able to train and play for 90 minutes like he did today, so I was happy with his performance. He (Drogba) has scored so many goals like this.'
