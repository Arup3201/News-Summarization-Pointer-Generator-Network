Business magnate Donald Trump is reportedly set to add one of the world's most famous golf courses to his portfolio.

The U.S. tycoon is close to completing a £35million deal to buy Scotland's Turnberry Golf Course, following months of secret negotiations.

The South Ayrshire course, which is tipped to host its fifth Open in the next 10 years, is currently owned by Leisurecorp, a subsidiary of the Dubai government.

Britain's first purpose built golf resort, Turnberry has hosted The Open championships four times in its history and is tipped to host the competition again in the next decade

They bought the complex, which includes a five star hotel, luxury self catering accommodation and a spa, for £52million in 2008.

But since the financial downturn swept the globe, the course has been unofficially up for sale.

One source told The Times: 'Turnberry will be the gem to crown Trump's golf portfolio and it is 95 per cent certain to go through.

'It is an open secret that Mr Trump had wanted an Open venue. This would be a tremendous coup for him.'

Billionaire property developer Trump recently added a five star golf resort on the west coast of Ireland to his collection, bringing the total resorts he owns across the world to 16.

The first purpose built golfing 
resort in Britain, Turnberry boasts three stunning courses, the Ailsa 
which has hosted the Open, the Kintyre and the Arran.

It was designed by Scottish architect James Miller and completed in 1906.

For many years golf at Turnberry was enjoyed only by locals. That was until the development of the railway as lines extended into Scotland, luring visitors from across the UK. 

To capitalise, South-Western Railway built its line from Ayr to Girvan, and the Station Hotel at Turnberry.

Rolling hills, sandy dunes, and a refreshing breeze blowing off the coast, draw thousands of golfers to the resort each year.

Turnberry's 
fairways have been shared by the game's elite players and amateur 
enthusiasts from all four corners of the globe.

The course was used as an airbase during the First World War and a landing strip built at the time remains, though is now no longer in use.

The Royal Flying Corps trained at Turnberry and the resort's hotel was used as a hospital for the wounded.

After the war the first and second courses were rebuilt and renamed Ailsa and Arran and a memorial to honour airmen who lost their lives during the conflict was erected and still stands overlooking the 12th green of the Ailsa course.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Turnberry was once again transformed, to play its part in the war effort. The hotel was commissioned as a hospital and the courses were seconded by the RAF. It is thought as many as 200 servicemen lost their lives training at the base.

Golf course designer Philip Mackenzie Ross restored Turnberry's courses to their pre-war glory and the Ailsa course was reopened in 1951.

The course first hosted The Open Championship in the late 1970s and 
since four spellbinding tournaments have graced the fairways and greens -
 the 106th in 1977, the 115th in 1986, the 123rd in 1994 and the last 
one in July 2009.

It is reported to be in line to host its fifth Open in the next decade.

The Ailsa has also hosted many other important tournaments, including the Women's British Open in 2002, the Walker Cup in 1963, the Amateur Championship in 1961, 1983, 1996 and 2008 and the Senior Open Championship six times between 1987 and 2006. 

The Women's British Open is to be staged at Turnberry next year.

The other two courses at Turnberry are the Kintyre Course and the nine-hole Arran course.

The Kintyre, designed by Donald Steel, opened in 2001 and is Turnberry's second championship standard course, that has hosted final qualifiying for The Open. The new Arran Course opened in 2002.

Turnberry is also home to the Colin Montgomerie Links Golf Academy, and a pitch and putt course.

In 2003 the 18th hold of the Ailsa couse was renamed Duel in the Sun, in honour of the famous battle between Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus during the 1977 Open tournament.

The
 resort is also served by a 149-bedroom five star hotel. The luxury 
collection hotel first opened in 1906 and underwent a multi-million 
renovation programme prior to hosting the 2009 Open tournament.

To play the Ailsa course between May 1 and October 12, will cost a visitor £250 per round. For the Kintyre course the price for that period is £90 while visitors will have to pay £40 per round on the Arran.

Prices range throughout the year from £110 per round on the Ailsa to £250, £55 to £90 on the Kintyre and £25 to £40 on the nine-hold Arran.

In February he lost a high-profile court battle after taking the Scottish government to task over their approval for an offshore wind farm in Aberdeen Bay.

Trump claimed the development would have a negative impact on the views from his luxury £750million links course in Menie.

As a result Trump announced his Trump Organisation would be focusing 'all of our investment and energy' on the Irish Doonbeg Golf Club in County Clare, with views over the Atlantic coast and renamed the Trump International Golf Links Ireland.

Donald Trump has said Menie golf resort in Aberdeenshire is not for sale.

The claim came after the property magnate pulled the plug on any future major investment after losing in his court battle with the Scottish government over plans to build an offshore windfarm in Aberdeen Bay.

Trump argued that the windfarm will blight the views from his resort.

The U.S. business tycoon purchased a large part of the Menie estate in 2006, with a view to building two 18-hole golf courses, a 450-room hotel, conference centre and spa, 36 golf villas and 950 holiday homes, accommodation for 400 staff and 500 homes.
