They are tales full of backstabbing and beheadings, and they are proving a massive hit.

The Royal Shakespeare Company is gearing up to put on two of its fastest selling shows on stage this month - both adaptations of highly-acclaimed Hilary Mantel novels.

Tickets for Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies, Mantel's Tudor court thrillers, sold out in hours after they went on sale in the spring.

Hilary Mantel, who became the first British writer to win the Man Booker Prize for Fiction twice, is having both books adapted for stage

Now the eagerly-awaited productions will take to the stage at the Swan theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon before they are expected to transfer to London in the new year.

The play will star Ben Miles, best known for appearing in the TV shows Coupling and Cold Feet, and Nathaniel Parker, star of the BBC's Inspector Lynley Mysteries.

Writer Mike Poulton, who had to adapted Mantel's second book less than a year after it was published, said: 'We had to create a viable play, rather than just try to put the novel on its feet â€“ because you can't do that.

'In a novel you take your time, you enjoy the pictures it creates in your mind, you go back and reread.'

Going head-to-head: Ben Miles (left), who played Patrick in the BBC sitcom Coupling, and (right) Mark Rylance, playing Richard III, will both play Tudor schemer Thomas Cromwell in stage and screen versions of the Mantel novel Wolf Hall

Mr Poulton, who has worked closely with Mantel, told The Observer he is planning some 'very telling dances' to tease out the tension in her books.

'The
 one thing you can't do is condense it and say we'll do broad 
brushstrokes. You can't ask an actor to play broad brushstrokes.'

Wolf Hall is also set to be brought to the small screen in a production commissioned by the BBC and America's Masterpiece Theatre.

The six-part serial will follow the meteoric rise of Cromwell in the Tudor court, from his lowly start as the son of a blacksmith to becoming King Henry VIIIâ€™s closest advisor.

Ben Miles and Mark Rylance will play Thomas Cromwell, the 1st Earl of Essex, who was a statesman who served as chief minister of King Henry VIII of England from 1532 to 1540

TV Bafta award-winning actor Mark Rylance is set to star in the lead role of arch-strategist Thomas Cromwell with Peter Kosminsky directing.

Filming is due to begin in Bruges in the spring.

BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow, Controller said: 'I'm so pleased that BBC Two will be the home to the adaptation of two of the great books of the last 10 years and I'm delighted we have talent of the standing of Mark Rylance and Peter Kosminsky at the helm of the drama.'

The BBC's drama commissioning controller Ben Stephenson said: 'I am excited to see this world-class team come together for the adaptation of Hilary Mantel's phenomenal books, Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies.

'This collaboration demonstrates the ambition of BBC Two drama and once again takes the scale of our content up another notch.'

In October last year Mantel became the first woman ever to win the Booker Prize twice after scooping the accolade for Bring Up the Bodies.

It followed the success of Wolf Hall, which won the prize in 2009. Both novels chronicle the dark 
world of Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII.
