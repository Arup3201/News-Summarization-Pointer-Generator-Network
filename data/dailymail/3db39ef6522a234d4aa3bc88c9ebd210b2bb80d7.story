A boy aged three died after a catalogue of failures by the NHS and in particular its out-of-hours services, a damning report is expected to reveal this week.

Sam Morrish died 36 hours after his parents first sought medical help for suspected flu and a chest infection.

In that crucial period, they say they experienced a series of shocking blunders from doctors, NHS Direct, an out-of-hours GP service and a hospital.

Sam Morrish died following a catalogue of errors by his local NHS providers in Devon in December 2010

The
 mistakes were compounded when the grieving couple asked the NHS to 
investigate the events leading to Sam’s death from septic shock to 
prevent future tragedies.

Two
 initial investigations failed to identify key problems, and Scott and 
Susanna Morrish said they were forced to relive ‘the life-shattering 
death’ of their child to get officials to finally act.

Mr
 Morrish, 41, said: ‘Sam was full of life. He was a force of nature, 
with an infectious sense of fun… If nobody listens and if the system is 
not changed then children like Sam will keep dying.’

Sam
 fell ill with suspected flu on December 21, 2010, and his mother took 
him to his local GP who said there was no sign of a chest infection. The
 toddler’s condition deteriorated overnight and his mother called the 
surgery the next morning to say he was worse and ‘constantly thirsty’.

She
 was asked if he had been passing urine and said he was too ill to get 
up and use the lavatory so she had kept him in a nappy. But the GP 
failed to ask if there was urine in the nappy. It was dry, a signal that
 Sam’s kidneys had begun to fail.

Sam was finally taken to Torbay Hospital, which is run by South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, where he died in December 2010

That
 evening after he vomited clear liquid containing thin strands which 
appeared to be blood his parents called NHS Direct, but their call was 
categorised as routine, not an emergency, and information was recorded 
wrongly.

Sam then vomited a 
black liquid and Mrs Morrish, 38, contacted an out-of-hours GP service, 
Devon Doctors, who told her to take Sam to a local treatment centre in 
Newton Abbot.

A young mother died from cancer after doctors told her to cure a lump on her breast with primrose oil ointment.

Samina Chaudhry, from Northampton, went back several times to say the treatment was not working.

Two years later, doctors sent a biopsy for analysis and advanced cancer was diagnosed. Scans found multiple tumours on her brain.

Her devastated husband Mohammed is now bringing up their sons Zeeshan, 13, and Usman, 11, on his own.

Mrs Chaudhry first visited her GP in 2006 when she was 27 and was referred to Northampton General Hospital where doctors diagnosed a skin condition similar to eczema and advised her to treat it with primrose oil ointment.

It wasn’t until November 2008 that a biopsy was sent to be examined. She died in 2012, aged 33.

Northampton General Hospital has now agreed to pay the family damages.

Mrs Morrish 
questioned the advice but was wrongly assured the treatment centre was 
her best option. The family learned later the advice was based on a 
conversation between the unqualified call handler and a driver.

At
 the treatment centre, the family were placed in a queue until Mrs 
Morrish flagged down a passing nurse who immediately raised the alarm.

The
 little boy was taken by ambulance to Torbay Hospital and prescribed 
antibiotics, but did not receive the drugs for three hours. By that time
 an invasive bacterial infection had entered his weakened system and he 
died from septic shock hours later on December 23.

The
 case highlighted concerns about the safety of out-of-hours care, 
including NHS Direct, which has since been replaced. But the family said
 their distress had been compounded by bureaucracy and failings in the 
complaints procedure.

According
 to the Patients Association, which has supported Mr and Mrs Morrish, 
two investigations commissioned by Devon NHS ‘failed to find answers and
 hold those involved to account’.

In
 March 2012 the couple complained to the Parliamentary and Health 
Service Ombudsman (PHSO), the highest authority on NHS complaints. But 
they said officials failed to understand information about the case.

The
 couple said they persevered in a bid to improve the health service for 
other patients, including their other sons, now aged nine and two.

The Patients Association said Sam’s death exposed ‘catastrophic and systemic’ failings in care and in how the NHS handles complaints.

Chief executive Katherine Murphy said: 'Having worked with the Morrish family over the last three years, our experience of the PHSO has been painful.

'The family wanted organisations to learn so that this would not happen again, but the ombudsman did not want to interview anyone about what went wrong.

'The PHSO is the body which is supposed to hold the NHS to account and set benchmarks but there seems to be a lack of accountability for its own actions.

'The Patients Association helpline has advised hundreds of people to contact the ombudsman but time and time again people have come back to us saying the PHSO has told them there’s nothing more they can do.

'At this point in time I would not advise anyone who came to our helpline to contact the PHSO, because I have no confidence in it. A senior executive within the PHSO told Mr Morrish and I the methodology used in their investigation into our complaints was not fit for purpose.

'It’s time that this organisation was subjected to greater scrutiny. It costs billions at a time when the NHS is struggling. If that money was invested in frontline staff we would have a very different NHS.'

The
 PHSO is due to publish its report into Sam’s death this week and is 
expected to uphold Mr and Mrs Morrish’s concerns about his treatment.

A
 PHSO spokesman said: ‘We recognise that we took too long to investigate
 this case.’ Devon Doctors said it was committed to ensuring such an 
occurrence cannot happen again.
