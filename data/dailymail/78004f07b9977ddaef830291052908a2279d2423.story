Sheffield has topped a list of Britain's happiest cities - with a third of the population saying they wake up with a smile on their face every day.

Tellingly, those polled ranked sex highly on the list of factors that keep them feeling upbeat, along with doing good deeds for others, spending time with family and being given a compliment.

The South Yorkshire steel centre beat southern spots including London, Bristol and popular seaside resort Brighton to the number one position.

Edinburgh was second on the list of the happiest cities, beating Brighton into third and the Welsh capital Cardiff into fourth position.

Other Scottish cities fared less well, with the study indicating that only 16 per cent of people in Glasgow feel good daily.

People in Norwich, which came in 13th place, rated sex highest on their list of factors that keep them feeling good seven days a week, with 43 per cent of people citing its importance - twice as many as in Belfast.

The study, commissioned by Transform Cosmetic Surgery Group, revealed 61 per cent of Britons say doing something nice for another person is what makes them feel good.

A substantial 72 per cent of people in the happiest city of Sheffield said doing good deeds puts them in a better mood.

In Manchester 60.9 per cent of people said the same, while 62.8 per cent of the population of Southampton said it was important to put other people's needs first in order to retain a sunny demeanour.

A total of 20.8 per cent of those surveyed said they felt at their best on a Saturday.

But the study also revealed a quarter of Britons never feel good about themselves. When asked to state the situation most likely to make them lose their confidence, over 25 per cent said looking at their own reflection.

Other situations likely to have a negative impact on a person's confidence were dealing with bank or utility companies, the study showed.

It suggested people's confidence peaks during the 24 to 35 age bracket.

A spokesman for Transform said: 'Although itâ€™s upsetting that still so many of us feel so low on a regular occurrence and how little confidence we have, itâ€™s refreshing to hear that confidence levels are on the up for the majority of us.'
