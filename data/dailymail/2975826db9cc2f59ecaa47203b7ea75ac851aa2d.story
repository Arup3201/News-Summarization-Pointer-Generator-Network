A New York teenager has opened the world's first sneaker pawnshop where other youngsters can  deposit their valuable trainers in return for cash.

The shop, which is the brainchild of Chase Reed, 16, from Harlem, stocks high-end designer models which are often high value because they are limited edition. 

Chase came up with the idea for Sneaker Pawn after asking his father, Troy, if he could borrow $50 (£29) just days after being bought a pair of expensive trainers.

Troy told the New York Post: 'I was like, ‘Are you serious?’ I’m holding these sneakers until I get my $50 back.'

The pair then opened the store - Chase sold his own 200-strong collection of trainers to raise funds for the opening.

Troy works in the shop during school hours, but the 10th grader works there after school and at weekends.

Shoes are only admitted once they have passed the smell test and owners are then given cash - they can redeem their sneakers at a later date or allow them to be sold.

Before any sale owners have first refusal and receive 80 per cent of the proceeds if they decide for it to go ahead.

Customers usually borrow around $100 per pair of lightly-worn trainers, although one was lent thousands of dollars after taking in a pair of sought-after Nike LeBron Crown Jewels and two pairs of Nike Air Jordans.

They must repay the loan at a rate of 20 per cent.

Mr Reed said: 'Young kids don’t have jewellery. They don’t have cars. But what they do have is the thousands of dollars worth of sneakers in their house.

'After we evaluate them, we’ll give the kid, say, $100 for the sneakers. If he wants them back, he’ll pay the $100, plus $20 for storing the sneakers.'

The pair said customers have pawned trainers for reasons indulging funeral costs,  and two teenage girls who wanted cash to buy prom dresses. 

The owner of the LeBron Crown Jewels used the money to move to the Bronx from Brooklyn.

In recent years limited edition and exclusive trainers have become big business.

A pair of Air Jordan 1s that were 
autographed by the basketball great himself once sold at auction for 
$60,000 - so Kanye West is a long way off entering the 'most expensive 
sneaker hall of fame'.

However,
 it took just 11 minutes for the hip hop mogul's special edition Nike 
sneakers to sell out after a surprise release was announced by
 the shoe giant - and about the same time for them to start and be 
hawked on eBay.

The shoes, called the Air Yeezy II Red Octobers, retailed for $245.

They are currently on sale on eBay for between $1,700 and $15,000.

In December chaos followed the release of Nike's Air Jordan 11 Gamma Blue sneaker as fights broke out in stores across the country between customers keen to get their hands on a pair.

Each year, the highly anticipated release of a new version of limited edition Air Jordans is released and each year, a spate of robberies, assaults, riots and even deaths occur.

In 2012, Joshua Woods, 22, was killed in Houston, Texas shortly after buying a pair of newly-released Air Jordans by four men who followed him from the mall.

His mother, Dazie Williams, has launched a campaign called Life Over Fashion which aims to change the way Nike distributes its sought-after sneakers.

'Nike nor Michael Jordan didn’t pull the trigger that killed my son, but with great power comes great responsibility. It’s product liability. If your name is on a product, you have to stand up.

'The first person that got killed [for Jordans] was in 1989, and here we are in 2013,' she said.
