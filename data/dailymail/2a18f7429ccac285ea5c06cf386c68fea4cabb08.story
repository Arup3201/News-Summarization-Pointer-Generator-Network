Little Ireland Nugent's parents have been trying to tell her their 2-year-old daughter that her legs have been amputated but they're having a hard time.

Three weeks ago, an horrific lawn-mower accident in Palm Harbor, Florida severed both of her legs below the knees.

Her mother Nicole Nugent told the Tampa Bay Times that they were trying to find the words in the the hope that she would understand.

Still my little girl: Jerry Nugent hugs his daughter, Ireland, in a Florida hospital. Just three weeks ago he accidentally cut off his daughters' legs after running her over with his lawnmower

Brave: Ireland's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb

Brave: Her parents are adament that their little girl, Ireland, will walk again

'We were playing with Mr. Potato Head yesterday and taking the feet on and off and I said, 'This is going to be like you, Ireland. We're going to take your feet on and off.' She doesn't really understand. She's honestly so little that I don't really think she gets that.'

Brave Ireland has asked virtually no questions about the past, but her parents worry about what is to come.

So far she's already had to undergo seven operations and now her parents, Jerry and Nicole are looking into prosthetic-limb providers and group therapy for themselves and their other children.

Incredibly, Ireland is managing to smile through it all and is keeping far calmer than her parents.

Simplicity: Ireland's mom, Nicole, is trying to get her daughter used to the idea of prosthetic leg. She told her that she was going to be like Mr Potatohead

Harrowing ordeal: Ireland, seen here in her hospital bed, has had to undergo seven surgeries since her accident three weeks ago

She is heavily drugged-up with pain medication and one of her arms is in cast.

However, when media were allowed to visit the girl for the first time yesterday, they reported that Ireland appeared to be awake, alert and full of curiosity with her cheeks sporting a healthy glow.

She was given a package of Play-doh and animal-shaped cookie cutters.

It's Ireland's smile that helps strengthen her family.

'She's just happy and spunky and it keeps us going,' her mom, Nicole said. 'She's been very strong through this whole process. In fact, it's been hard for us to even read that she's in pain at times. I kind of have to read her physical cues because she just doesn't cry.'

On Tuesday, her dad said that he was rubbing the ends of his daughter's legs.

The idea was to alleviate the 'phantom limb' sensations that trouble many amputees.

'I love your little legs,' he told her.

'Thank you, daddy,' she replied.

Comforting: The family are trying to make things as normal as possible for the little girl, even while she is still in hospital

Support: The family say the support from the community has been overwhelming. Her hospital room is awash with cards, toys and balloons

Support: Ireland Nugent's mom and dad have been with her every day since the accident on April 11th

The little girl was injured on April 11th when she ran after her father, Jerry, as he rode a lawn mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home.

Her mother, Nicole, frantically waved at him to stop, but he misunderstood and put the lawn mower in reverse backing over his child.

Both her legs were severed below the knee. Her hand was also cut and her thumb broken.

The Nugents say the financial and moral support they've received from the community has been overwhelming.

Balloons, toys, and cards fill her hospital room.

A fund established for Ireland's medical care and expenses at Trinity Presbyterian had raised about $85,000 and the family are continuing to raise money.

Bright future: Doctors plan to fit the toddler with prosthetic legs in a few weeks once her wounds dry and heal

The family is already making plans to have Ireland fitted for prosthetic limbs in Orlando.

 Two funds have been set up to accept donations for Ireland Nugent's family.

•
Trinity Presbyterian Church: Checks can be made out to 'Trinity 
Presbyterian Foundation' (with 'Ireland Nugent' on the memo line) and 
sent to Trinity Presbyterian Church, 2001 Rainbow Drive, Clearwater, FL 
33765. Or donate by credit card online: trinityclearwater.org.

•
The Pinellas County government has arranged for a special fund through 
Pinellas Federal Credit Union in Ireland Nugent's name. Find details 
online at pinellasfcu.org or call (727) 586-4422.

Her mother says she and her husband are looking towards the future and working out how they will cope when Ireland returns home.

They will have to make adjustments to the family home in order to make life as easy as possible for the little girl.

Her siblings may also need some counseling as they adjust to life without Ireland's legs.

Later today, doctors will do a final check of two skin grafts to make sure they've healed. If they have it would mean Ireland is one step closer to coming home.

Her mother told WSTP: 'This has been the biggest nightmare of my life, honestly. I never imagined that this would happen to her, but through this have come so many blessings,' Nicole says.

'First, she lived, and we didn't know when it first happened if that was going to happen.'

Ireland's father agrees. 'When I see her, it's just like a weight is lifted and I know she's there and she's going to be okay.'
