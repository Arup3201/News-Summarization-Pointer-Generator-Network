Thrill-seeking Britons sick of the average package holiday are snapping up alternative breaks to nuclear disaster zone Chernobyl, extremist Iran and even despot-ruled North Korea.

Keen backpacker Dylan Harris has set up Manchester-based Lupine Travel to cater for danger tourists who like him are desperate to explore some of the most hostile destinations on Earth.

Thousands have enjoyed golf trips in Iran, snow rugby in Mongolia and a body-destroying ultramarathon in Turkmenistan - where superhumans embark on a 162-mile run across deserts and vast desolate areas.

Three group holidays to North Korea were organised last year, with dozens heading to sight-see in Pyongyang and go on bus trips into the countryside.

Alternative: Dylan Harris set up Manchester-based Lupine Travel to cater for danger tourists who are desperate to explore some of the most hostile destinations on earth

Trips to Chernobyl start from as little 
as £119 and all costs are designed to suit budget travellers with a 
taste for the alternative.

And if that's not enough former librarian and IT support worker Dylan is plotting future ventures to the Gaza Strip and may even set up boat trips off the pirate ruled Somalian coast.

Politics graduate Dylan is an entrepreneur with a passion for travelling to out of the ordinary places.

Having built a successful business 
organising music gigs and club nights in Wigan, he turned his hand to 
catering for the niche market of extreme holidaying - a market that has 
exploded in recent years.

Dylan said: 'Since 2007 I've sent thousands of people on tours, with Chernobyl and North Korea proving to be the most popular.

'People are always really positive and a huge number come back and book further destinations with me.

'When I started the trips, I expected 
to attract a young backpacker crowd - but I've had everyone from young 
families with newborns travelling to North Korea, to a group of 
80-year-olds tackling the Trans-Mongolian trip.'

Dylan insists that the locations he takes his tours to are not dangerous, despite the Western media's profiling of them.

Many of his customers have a passion for history and politics and like to see these regions for themselves, while others are just curious.

But while many everyday people have a keen interest in exploring reclusive areas as a hobby, the process of getting into old warzones, disaster sites and dictatorships is a challenging process that is solely dependent on trust.

Dylan, 34, said: 'I'm actually going 
to Somaliland early next year - the supposedly safer northern part of 
Somalia - and will look into a paddle boating idea.

'I'm also looking into setting up trips to the Gaza Strip. A friend of mine works for Oxfam and has been over there recently.

'They recommended it as a possible future destination and passed on several contacts to me.'

He said: 'This is the most difficult part because no matter how well established you are with the authorities, one little mistake could throw it all away, it's all about trust.

'Many of these destinations don't allow journalists to visit so I need to be extra vigilant in case anyone applies with false employment details.

'This has happened occasionally in the past and set me back a long time and almost jeopardised my entire business so I have to ensure I employ extra check to ensure things like this don't happen again.'

Many of the world's most secret dictatorships, such as North Korea, rigorously scrutinise people travelling into the country, evening deleting pictures and confiscating souvenirs.
