Glorious weather, a carnival atmosphere and a defiant and emotional outpouring of support for those affected by the Boston bombs have made this year's London Marathon one to remember.

But while it will be filled with happy memories for thousands of runners and spectators, for James Carvel and Lianne Humphries it will be a day they never forget.

The couple both took part in the iconic race today and, like most of the exhausted athletes, were jubilant to cross the line after a gruelling 26 mile run.

However, as Lianne savoured the moment, James dropped to one knee and suddenly produced a hidden ring.

As fellow participants clapped, cheered and took pictures on their mobile phones, James popped the question.

Fortunately for him she said yes and the two shared their first kiss as an engaged couple.

Social media users also applauded the happy couple. Mike Alderson tweeted: 'Sweet: There was a wedding proposal during the London marathon,' while Ciny Logan tweeted: 'This is so cute.'

User Beauty by the Geeks added: 'Aww a marrage proposal with two running partners at the #londonmarathon finish line! Don't worry she said yes! :)'

The moment was just one of many happy moments in a well-attended event that many feared for in the wake of the Boston bombing.

Before the race the runners held a 30 second silence to remember the three dead and honour those injured in the blast.

'The best ever! A lot of emotion because of the Boston marathon,' said Nathan Comer, 38, catching his breath just after finishing his third London Marathon.

'The silence before the marathon was beautiful ... it just felt as if everyone was together,' he said.

One spectator held up a placard that read 'Come on London, do it for Boston!' while some runners had the name of the U.S. city emblazoned on their vests, but despite these sombre reminders the mood was overwhelmingly one of celebration.

The pair were both running for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity
