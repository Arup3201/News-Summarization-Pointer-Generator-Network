Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore has drawn criticism over a comment about concealed weapon permits.

The Las Vegas Republican came under fire from Assembly leaders and women's groups after she was quoted in the New York Times as saying 'hot little girls' need concealed weapons to defend themselves from rapists.

'If these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them,' Fiore told the newspaper. '

Speaking her mind: Assembly woman Michele Fiore, a conservative Las Vegas Republican, talked about her bill that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms on Nevada campuses 

Firey: Fiore is the main sponsor of a bill introduced last week that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to take their firearms onto the state's college campuses

Blunt: Fiore said assaults would decrease once sexual predators got bullets in their heads

'The sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head.' 

The Nevada Women's Lobby and Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Marilyn Kirkpatrick issued statements against Fiore's comments, calling them unrepresentative of rape victims and objectifying of women.

Fiore didn't back down from her statement and said on her website that the quote was not the most 'eloquent' but she still stood by the sentiment behind it. 

'That may not be the most eloquent way to phrase it,' she acknowledged in a statement released on Wednesday afternoon. 

'However, I stand wholeheartedly by that sentiment because I want every citizen, whether they're on a college campus or not, to have the right to defend him or herself from sexual assault.'

Different approach: Gun control advocates have linked the push to allow concealed carry based on a sexual assault prevention justification with the firearms industry's recent attempts to appeal more broadly to women

Outspoken: Ms. Fiore of Nevada, predicts the Republican-controlled Nevada Legislature and Republican governor would enact her bill which will allow guns to be carried on campus

Fiore is a fierce supporter of gun rights who has referred to herself as a 'conservative, Catholic, gun-toting, second amendment, strong-ass woman' and as 'someone that carries a firearm on me like my panties and bra.' 

She has acknowledged that she carries her firearm even in gun-free zones. 

Gun enthusiasts recently attempted to capitalize on the recent attention over the numbers of sexual assaults on college campuses to push their agenda. 

The gun lobby is increasingly trying to appeal to women and one of the ways they have been doing so recently is by telling women to take steps to prevent their own rapes.

'The gun lobby has seized on this tactic, this subject of sexual assault. It resonates with lawmakers,' Andy Pelosi, the executive director of the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, told the New York Times in the same article that included Fiore's comments.

University presidents, college students, and domestic violence experts are all opposed to the idea of allowing concealed weapons on school grounds.
