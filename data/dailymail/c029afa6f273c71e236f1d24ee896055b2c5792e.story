David Cameron concealed a private meeting with Rebekah Brooks two days after his communications director Andy Coulson was forced to quit over phone hacking, according to a controversial book.

The Prime Minister held at least two private conversations with Mrs Brooks that have not been disclosed by Downing Street and warned her they could not be seen together, it says.

The book, an updated unofficial biography of the Prime Minister, reveals that Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks met at the Heythrop point-to-point, a race meeting run by a hunt near both their homes in Oxfordshire.

Before they met Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks texted each other to make sure they were not seen together, it alleges.

The meeting is significant because it 
came on January 23, 2011 – two days after Mr Coulson was forced to 
resign as communications director as the hacking scandal spread.

Attending the infamous Christmas dinner with Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch at which the BSkyB bid was discussed was a mistake, David Cameron confessed two weeks ago.

The Prime Minister insisted he made no 'grand deal' with the pair in exchange for their media empire's support for the Tories.

Mr Cameron admitted having a conversation with Mr Murdoch over his father Rupert's proposed takeover of BSkyB at a party at the Oxfordshire home of Mrs Brooks, who is now on police bail in the phone-hacking investigation.

His remarks came amid claims Mrs Brooks, a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch's News International, is ready to disclose all private email and text message exchanges with Mr Cameron.

The dinner party took place on December 23, 2010, just two days after Business Secretary Vince Cable was stripped of responsibility for adjudicating on the BSkyB deal after boasting of having 'declared war' on the Murdoch empire.

Mr Cameron claimed he did not recall the exact details of his conversation with James Murdoch, but said it concerned the controversy over Mr Cable.

He was a close ally of Mrs Brooks and her successor as editor of the News of the World, where phone hacking took place.

A second meeting between Mr Cameron 
and Mrs Brooks at the Chipping Norton fair was also not disclosed by No 
10 when they released a list of Mr Cameron’s meetings with media 
executives.

No 10 admitted the conversations took 
place but said they were only bound to publish details of formal 
lunches, dinners or meetings with media chiefs, rather than social 
events.

It was claimed last night that 
photographs were taken of Mr Cameron, his wife Samantha and baby 
Florence with Mrs Brooks and her racehorse trainer husband Charlie at 
the point-to-point but have not been released at Mr Cameron’s request.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister asks photographers not to use pictures of his children.

The book, Cameron: Practically a 
Conservative by Francis Elliott and James Hanning, reveals startling new
details of Mr Cameron’s closeness to Mrs Brooks.

The Prime Minister texted the former 
chief executive of Rupert Murdoch’s News International firm telling her 
to ‘keep her head up’ in the same week as she resigned over the phone 
hacking scandal, it is alleged.

The authors also claim he assured her that she ‘would get through her difficulties’.

According to the book, even when he 
then cut off contact with her Mr Cameron sent Mrs Brooks an emissary 
apologising that ‘I couldn’t have been as loyal to you as you were to 
me’.

The claims come as Mrs Brooks prepares to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards tomorrow.

Downing Street is also braced for 
testimony today from Mr Coulson, who resigned as News of the World 
editor over phone hacking but went on to become Mr Cameron’s 
communications director.

The book says Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks would often ‘pop round to one another’s houses’ in Oxfordshire.

Mr Cameron was friends at Eton with 
Mrs Brooks’s husband Charlie and the pair let Mr Cameron ride a retired 
police horse loaned to her.

The book contains an extraordinary 
statement from Cabinet Minister Oliver Letwin that Mrs Brooks expected 
Mr Cameron to see her every week.

Last night Shadow Cabinet Office 
Minister Gareth Thomas said: ‘The Prime Minister needs to disclose fully
all his meetings, and their terms, with Rebekah Brooks and other staff 
at News International as a matter of urgency.’
