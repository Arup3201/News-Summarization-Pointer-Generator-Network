A teenager has had assault charges upgraded to murder in Queensland after the elderly man he's accused of attacking died in hospital.

The 72-year-old man was driving on Glenella Connection Road when an 18-year-old man allegedly threw an object at his four-wheel-drive, causing the windscreen to shatter on Saturday morning. 

The man suffered facial injuries from the glass and immediately stopped his vehicle around 4am.
