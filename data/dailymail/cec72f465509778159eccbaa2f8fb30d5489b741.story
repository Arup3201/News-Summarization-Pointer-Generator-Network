The Lockerbie bomber’s release was linked to a £400million arms deal with Libya, secret documents reveal.

They show ‘reprehensible’ connections between the Labour government boosting business and freeing the man convicted of Britain’s worst terrorist atrocity.

An email sent by the then UK ambassador in Tripoli to former premier Tony Blair explained how a prisoner transfer agreement will be signed once Libya ‘fulfils its promise’ to buy an air defence system.

The disclosure, obtained under Freedom of Information laws, reignites a row which is hugely embarrassing for Labour.

At the time of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi’s release in August 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown and his senior ministers insisted there was no link to ‘blood money’ trade deals with Colonel Gaddafi.

Megrahi, a Libyan, was convicted of killing 270 people by blowing up an American airliner over Lockerbie in December 1988. He was sent home early from a Scottish jail on compassionate grounds because he had terminal prostate cancer. He died last year. Ministers insisted his release was a decision taken solely by the Scottish government.

The email was sent by Sir Vincent Fean, then the UK’s top diplomat in Libya, to Mr Blair, ahead of his visit to Gaddafi in June 2008. It updated Mr Blair, who quit Downing Street a year earlier, on the UK’s ongoing relations with the brutal dictator.

Prior to this, Mr Blair met Gaddafi and his prime minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi in Sirte in a desert tent. The pair thrashed out a memorandum of understanding on prisoner transfers just before BP announced the firm was investing about £545million to search for £13billion of oil in Libya.

But according to the email, Mr Blair and Baghdadi agreed Libya would buy a missile defence system from MBDA, part-owned by BAE Systems. When he returned in June 2008 the Government appeared to see a chance for him to push for the arms deal to be sealed.

Sir Vincent wrote: ‘There is one bilateral issue which I hope TB [Tony Blair] can raise, as a legacy issue. On 29 May 07 in Sirte, he and Libya’s PM agreed that Libya would buy an air defence system (Jernas) from the UK (MBDA).

‘One year on, MBDA are now back in Tripoli aiming to agree and sign the contract now — worth £400million, and up to 2,000 jobs in the UK. We think we have Col Q’s [Gaddafi’s] goodwill for this contract. This issue can also be raised with Libya’s PM. It was PM Baghdadi who told the media on 29 May 07 that Libya would buy British.

‘Linked (by Libya) is the issue of the 4 bilateral justice agreements about which TB signed an MoU with Baghdadi on 29 May. The MoU says they will be negotiated within the year: they have been.

They are all ready for signature in London as soon as Libya fulfils its promise on Jernas.’ The prisoner transfer agreement was signed in November 2008.

Susan Cohen, whose daughter Theo, 20, was among those killed at Lockerbie, said: ‘These revelations simply serve to increase the awful stench that still surrounds the whole scandal. They turned human tragedy into a business transaction. It’s absolutely reprehensible.’

Lord Mandelson, Business Secretary at the time of Megrahi’s release, said then that it was ‘offensive’ to suggest it was linked to improving commercial relations with Libya.

He said yesterday: ‘I was not aware of the correspondence covered in this FOI request.’ Mr Blair’s spokesman said the email did not show ‘the UK government was trying to link the defence deal and Megrahi’. He said: ‘Actually it shows the opposite – that any linkage was from the Libyan side. As far as we’re aware there was no linkage on the UK side. What the email in fact shows is that, consistent with what we have always said, it was made clear to the then Libyan leader that the release of Megrahi was a matter for Scotland. Of course the Libyans, as they always did, raised Megrahi.’

MBDA said yesterday the Libyans never signed the arms deal.
