A father has set up a fake speed camera outside his home in a bid to slow down drivers after the family cat was run over by a car.

Antony Cull said his daughter was 'devastated' when their black-and-white cat Millie, who he called 'part of the family', was hit on a busy stretch of road near their home in Shrewton, Wiltshire.

The father-of-two decided to take the situation into his own hands, creating the dummy out of a painted kitchen cupboard and putting it up outside his home.

Taking control: Antony Cull made the camera out of wood from a kitchen cupboard and put it up outside his home in Shrewton, Wiltshire, after the family cat was run over. He said other residents supported his idea

Mr Cull, 27, said: 'Millie was a very happy, friendly cat. It really upset my children so I decided something had to be done.

'My speed camera has had a huge effect - drivers slow down and slam on their brakes when they see it.

'Someone
 in the village wrote on Facebook asking drivers to honk when they drove
 past if they supported me and we hear so many horns beeping.

'People have stopped and knocked on my door to say ‘Well done’ and tell me they agree with me.'

He said traffic collisions happened 
regularly on the 30mph road, which has a number of bends, and wants to 
see the speed limit dropped to 20mph.

The first fake camera, which was attached to a 5ft-stick in his garden, was pulled down and burnt on Saturday. Mr Cull and a neighbour made another one to replace it and had screwed it into a fence panel - but it has since been stolen. 

Now Mr Cull, a recovery driver, has vowed to weld a metal version to replace it.

Effective: Mr Cull said that the fake camera had been effective and that drivers on the busy stretch of road often slowed down when they spotted the distinctive yellow box. This version of the 'camera' has since been stolen

Wiltshire Council said that the fake speed camera is on council land and wants it removed. Mr Cull argues that it is on his land and added 'the main thing is that it works'.

But one councillor conceded that the makeshift speed camera was ‘very effective’.

Ian West, a Liberal Democrat, said: 'We want action. That fake camera is action.

'Although it’s probably not what authorities want to see it’s very effective at slowing traffic down and that’s what people are clearly for.'

Wiltshire Police said it was not illegal to put up a fake speed camera, as long as it was on the resident’s property.

A spokesperson said: 'You can put anything up on your property unless it’s distracting drivers and causing hazards.

Third time lucky: After having the first 'camera' stolen, Mr Cull built a second, pictured. This has since been stolen and he swears he will build a third, which he will weld on to the pole to stop it from being taken

'If Mr Cull had put it up on council land, it could then become a civil issue for them.'

Wiltshire Council said it has a ‘robust’ system for handling speeding issues.

A spokesman said: 'The council has a robust system for dealing with speeding issues raised by local communities.

'Issues should be referred to the local community area board, who will work with the local community to examine what speed control measures are appropriate for that particular road.

'The considerations to deal with speeding issues will include the use of the volunteer speedwatch scheme, installation of speed indicator devices or other direct measures.

'It is vital that any scheme introduced is effective and delivers the required result.

'The council would ask everyone to follow the approved procedure to ensure the best scheme is delivered to meet the community needs.'

A traffic survey monitoring vehicle movements on the A303 and through the surrounding villages started this week.

The monitoring exercise uses automatic number plate recognition technology to individually track the behaviour of motorists in the survey area.
