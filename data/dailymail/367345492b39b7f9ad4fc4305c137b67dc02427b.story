A woman with a prosthetic leg is fighting back after a neighbor left a scathing note on her car when she complained they had parked in her reserved space.

Ashley Brady, 26, has had to learn how to walk again after losing her right leg in an accident last summer and during the recent snowstorm, she struggled to cross the parking lot.

So her apartment complex in Miamisburg, Ohio created a handicapped parking spot  at the bottom of the steps to her home.

But on Saturday, two days after the spot was designated for handicapped people only, she found another car there with no placard displayed in its window, WKEF reported.

Shock: Ashley Brady, who lost her leg in an accident last year, found a threatening note beneath her windshield after she complained to a neighbor that they had parked in her disabled parking spot

Cruel: The note, which called her 'Handicap', told Brady to keep her hands off the person's car

So she left a note pointing out the error and warning the driver that their car would be towed if they left it there again. She was stunned when she found a note under her own windshield.

'Hey handicap! First, never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain't the only one with "struggles." You want pity go to a one leg support group! You messed with the wrong one! I don't care what your note said shove it, but you touch my car again I will file a report, I am not playing! I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I'm walking away with both mine! - B****.'

'Hey handicap!' it read. 'First, you never place your hands on my car again! Second, honey you ain't the only one with "struggles".'

The letter instructed Brady to go to 'a one leg support group' if she wanted pity and warned that the police would be contacted if Brady touched her car again.

'I let the office know the cry baby one leg touches my property I will cause trouble so go cry your struggles to someone who cares cause I'm walking away with both mine!' the letter read.

Brady said she was so shocked by how rude the note was that she had to read it several times to process it. 

Her sister then posted a picture of the note to Facebook to highlight the struggles faced by people with disabilities and it has since been shared more than 1,600 times.

Life-changing: Brady said she was relieved to get her own space because of the recent icy weather

New life: Brady shows her prosthetic, which has helped her walk again after losing her leg last summer

On the Facebook post, hundreds of people have given their support to Brady, calling for the writer of the note to be reported to the police or have their car towed.

Brady quipped: 'She told me to cry to someone who cares, so I went to the internet and it turns out a lot of people care.'

After receiving the note, Brady filed a grievance with the Miamisburg police and notified the management of her apartment complex.

The managers said they have not yet decided on a course of action.
