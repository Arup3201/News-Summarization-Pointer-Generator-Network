David Cameron today called on Turkey to do more to tackle jihadi fighters in Iraq and Syria – and help stop British fanatics joining them.

The Prime Minister met the country’s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara amid growing concern over Turkey’s failure to take the fight to the Islamist fanatics across its border.

Britain and the US have been pushing Turkey to do more in the battle against ISIS. There have also been calls for more help in tracking Britons travelling to the region to fight.

Turkey has been in discussions with US officials about the possibility of a no-fly zone over northern Syria in return for American use of a key airbase to launch strikes against Isis.

Mr Cameron and President Erdogan are also expected to discuss Turkey’s efforts to join the European Union, which the UK supports.

The PM’s visit to Turkey coincides with that of Federica Mogherini, the new EU foreign affairs commissioner, who wads due to visit a refugee camp on Turkey’s southern border and hold talks with its leaders.

Turkey has already absorbed up to 1.8 million refugees and is braced for more if the conflict intensifies.

Ms Mogherini, a former Italian foreign minister, took up the role at the beginning of November.

A statement from the EU said: 'This joint visit, early in the mandate of the new European commission, demonstrates the importance of Turkey… as a candidate country negotiating accession to the European Union and as a key partner and neighbour considering its strategic location and dynamic economy.

'It is also a clear sign of our willingness and determination to step up engagement across the whole range of the EU-Turkey relationship to fully reflect the strategic importance of our relations.'

The prime minister’s trip means he will miss his weekly clash in the House of Commons with the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, tomorrow.

His place at the dispatch box will be taken by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg - who has missed the weekly debate for the last three week.

Mr Clegg was also absent for last week’s autumn statement, as the Liberal Democrats ramp up their bid to differentiate themselves from the Tories ahead of the next election.
