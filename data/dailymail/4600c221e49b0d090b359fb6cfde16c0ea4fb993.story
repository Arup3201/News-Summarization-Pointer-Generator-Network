An elderly man shot dead two women before turning the gun on himself at their senior citizens' complex, police said.

Residents and staff at the southern California high-rise complex had complained about an elderly man's erratic behavior and wanted him evicted before the fatal shooting on Tuesday.

The man, in his 80s, allegedly shot the two women shortly after noon before turning the gun on himself in the lobby of the Golden West Tower apartments in Torrance, said Sgt Robert Watt.

One of the women was an employee of the 
apartment complex but victim identities are being withheld until next of
kin is notified.

Witness Arturo Ramirez, who works at the Golden West Towers, said he locked himself in an office to call 911 after seeing a man who lived in the facility holding a gun.

Ramirez said he heard one of the women killed say, 'Please, no! Please!' and then heard two gunshots. A final gunshot came a few minutes later.

Police are still investigating the man's motive but residents and staff from the senior center told a local TV station that the man had been behaving erratically, and many of them were seeking to have him kicked out of the complex.

'People knew that he was a little bit off,' Golden Tower employee Alex Galindo said.

'People were warned, but nobody did 
anything, so I know there's going to be blood on a lot of people's 
hands. That's all I can say at this point.'

A handgun was recovered at the scene. Sgt Watt said the building's management had received complaints about the alleged shooter but police were never alerted.

Police were trying to obtain surveillance-camera recordings of the shooting, Watt said.

According to the city of Torrance's website, Golden West Towers is a 180-unit, privately owned and operated facility. The low- and moderate-income housing is for seniors who can live independently.

A call to building management was not answered on Tuesday night.

The incident is the latest in a string of murder-suicides at Southern California senior centers.

In a shooting last month, investigators suspect 45-year-old Colin McGrattan shot and killed his ex-wife and her two nieces at O'Connor Woods Senior Living Center in Stockton before killing himself.

In 2010, 77-year-old Arthur Baar shot and killed his wife, Caryl, 72, before turning the gun on himself in Laguna Woods, the south Orange County retirement community formerly known as Leisure World.
