A feeble display from Arsene Wenger's side saw them sink to a 3-1 defeat at home to Monaco in the last 16 of the Champions League.

Geoffrey Kondogbia put Monaco ahead after 38 minutes and former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov doubled the lead eight minutes into the second half. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pulled one back as the game went into stoppage time, but Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco added a third for Monaco in the final seconds.

Arsenal (4-2-3-1):

David Ospina 7

Saved Arsenal on 61 minutes with smart reaction to Martial; couldn't do much for the deflected goal.

Hector Bellerin 4

Lost ball for second goal. Troubled by Anthony Martial all night and poor delivery going forward.

Arsenal defender and captain Mertesacker was not his usual authoritative self for his team on Wednesday 

Per Mertesacker 4

Meant to be the leader of the defence so has to take responsibility for the shocking display. Unlucky deflection for first goal? Maybe, but it was an ungainly attempt at a block.

Laurent Koscielny 4.5

Just as culpable. Where was he and what was he thinking for Monaco's second and third?

Kieran Gibbs 4.5

Had done better than his colleagues - until he was caught out for the third goal.

Francis Coquelin 4.5

Afforded Monaco far too much space and didn't provide defensive shield - that's his primary purpose.

Santi Cazorla's performance was not as purposeful as his previous impressive displays

Danny Welbeck (centre) lifted a good chance over the bar in the early exchanges of Arsenal against Monaco

Santi Cazorla 5.5

Not enough pace or purpose in the passing. Great free kick for Giroud but uncomfortable and unaccomplished in defensive duties

Danny Welbeck 5

Has to do better for the first goal; didn't do enough thereafter.

Mesut Ozil 4

It was for nights like this that Arsenal paid £42m. And it is on nights like these he continues to disappoint

Alexis Sanchez 6

The best of a bad bunch. Not good, just better than the rest.

Olivier Giroud missed a number of superb chances for Arsenal on a night to forget for the France international

Olivier Giroud 3.5

What to say? The header he missed on 52 minutes was bad enough; the open goal just awful.

Subs: 

Theo Walcott (Giroud 60) 6

Did his utmost but damage had been done. 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 7 (Coquelin 68) 

Great finish which should have given Arsenal hope.

Tomas Rosicky 6 (Cazorla 82) 

No blame attached. Introduced too late to have an impact. 

Manager: Arsene Wenger 4 

When a team defends this badly this often, the coach has to take the blame.

Monaco (4-1-4-1)

Danijel Subasic 7 

Solid throughout and a good foundation for the win.

Almamy Toure 8

Just superb for a raw youngster - crucial part in first goal.

Wallace 8.5 

His goal-line clearance from Danny Welbeck was just one moment in an outstanding night.

Monaco's central defender Wallace (right) was outstanding in the heart of his side's back line 

Aymen Abdennour 8 

Stand-in defender and he was accomplished and solid. 

Elderson 7.5

Excellent at left back, probing going forward. 

Fabinho 7.5

Playing out of position he provided the hard running and dirty defensive work for the midfield.

Anthony Martial 8

Incisive run and pace to set up the second goal - troubled Bellerin all night long.

Anthony Martial (right) helped Monaco defensively and also contributed to his side's second goal

Geoffrey Kondogbia 8.5

With Moutinho, outstanding, just the kind of player Arsenal need in midfield. Only marked down for turning his back on the Oxlade-Chamberlian strike

Joao Moutinho 9

Just a complete performance, defensively and going forward. His flick on 61 minutes to set up Martial? His volley on 63 minutes? The best moments of the match.

Nabil Dirar 7

The captain was probing going forward and diligent in protecting his young full back

Dimitar Berbatov 8

Three Arsenal defenders tried to prevent him getting his shot away - but he was never going to miss. Still exquisite at what he does best.

Berbatov (second right) scored Monaco's second with a composed finish under pressure

Subs:

Yannick Ferreira-Carrasaco (Berbatov 74) 8

Great run and finish for the killer third goal. 

Layvin Kurzawa (Dirar 82) 6

Solid and did his job when came on. 

Bernando Silva (Martial 83) 6

Added defensive steel when he came on for last seven minutes

Manager: Leonardo Jardim 9 

A perfectly-executed plan, his star continues to rise. His exploits here and at Sporting are noticed.

Ref: Deniz Aytekin 7 

The perfect performance for a ref - non descript
