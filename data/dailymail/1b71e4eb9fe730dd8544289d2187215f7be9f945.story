The relative size difference should have meant it was no contest.

But amazingly, this wasp was able to get the better of its formidable opponent.

The battle between the two creatures was filmed in Arizona, in the US.

The footage shows a two-inch Tarantula Hawk wasp, which as their name suggests, preys on tarantulas.

A female Tarantula Hawk can seek out its prey by its smell and, after finding its burrow, will go inside and force the spider out.

A battle ensues as the wasp attempts to sting the tarantula, often by flipping it on its back. If the wasp succeeds in stinging the tarantula, the tarantula will become paralyzed.

The wasp will drag the tarantula back to its own burrow and lay an egg in its abdomen. Once the egg hatches, the larva inside is able to feast on the spider’s flesh

Tarantula Hawk wasps are among the largest of the species. 

Their legs have hooked claws for grappling with their victims and the sting of the female is considered the second most painful insect sting in the world.
