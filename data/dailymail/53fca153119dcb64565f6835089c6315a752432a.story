He was essentially the most unpopular person in New York's East Village during the drastic renovations of his home.

But Friends star David Schwimmer seems to be slowly winning back his neighbors after helping police investigate a crime on Monday.

A brawl broke out in a first-floor apartment around 5.40am in a building that adjoins the actor's home on East Sixth Street.

The fight spilled into the hallway before the trio smashed through a glass lobby, according to The New York Post.

Cooperative: Actor David Schwimmer turned over video footage taken on the security cameras of his East Village home to the New York Police Department

Controversial: David Schwimmer paid $3.7 million for his East Village apartment, which sits at 331 E. Sixth St, in 2008, causing drama in the neighborhood when he knocked the existing building down

A 26-year-old man was taken to Bellevue Hospital with stab wounds to the face.

His transvestite prostitute ran away and the third man was arrested.

Robert Rainey, 21, of Newark, was charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and robbery.

Following the incident, police noticed a security camera on Schwimmer's property.

Investigators asked the 47-year-old if the cameras recorded any footage of the fight.

Schwimmer surrendered the tape, which may now be used in court.

The star, who played Ross Geller on Friends for 10 years, paid $4â€‰million for his 331 E. Sixth St. home in 2010.

He outraged locals in 2012 when he knocked down the existing building, which was 160-years-old.

'Four years ago, I would say David Schwimmer was the least popular guy on the block with the construction and all,' said resident Jayson Fillermutter, 31.

'But he has turned out to be a decent neighbor, and I am glad to hear he helped the cops with that stabbing.'

The structure Schwimmer bought was built in 1852.

He paid $3.7 million for it in 2008.

A demolition permit filed in 2011 listed 'demolition of front and rear facades, demolition of all floors roof structure, side masonry walls to remain'.

The cream-colored building was torn down and replaced with a brick building.
