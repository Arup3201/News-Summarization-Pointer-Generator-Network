Jordan Henderson has given the biggest indication yet that he will stay at Liverpool even though his contract runs out in 2016.

The England midfielder, tipped to succeed Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain, has been a revelation for club and country in the past 18 months and will face Italy on Tuesday as the mainstay of Roy Hodgson’s England midfield.

But Henderson insists that the ongoing talks with the club over a renewal to his contract will not distract him and has made it clear that he wants to sign a new deal to stay at Anfield.

‘Everybody else will make a big deal about it, but for me, I just let my agent and the club deal with it and whenever it gets sorted, it gets sorted,’ said Henderson. 

‘All I want to do is do my best for club or country. I don't want to get involved, really. Let the agents and the club deal with it, and we just focus on our football and I think that's the best way.’

Asked whether he was in the right place to win trophies and move forward with his career, Henderson said: ‘I definitely think so. I think obviously at Liverpool we've got fantastic players, real quality players and a lot of potential. 

'We're a young team and I think there is great potential and a big part of that is us wanting to be winners and winning trophies. I really feel we can do that. It is the same with England, I really feel we are going in the right direction and hopefully in the next Euros we can do something special.’

And Henderson insists he is not banking on replacing Gerrard as captain next season. ‘That's up to the manager in the summer,’ he said. ‘I'm not going to be captain as of yet. It could be anybody else in the team because we've got a lot of leaders and a lot of good characters in the team.

‘Of course it'd be an honour for me to do that, but when a big player like Stevie leaves, obviously it's disappointing, but everybody else has got to step up. 

'We've got a lot of young players in the team and next season, when he isn't there, it's time for everybody to show what they're capable of and show that little bit of extra responsibility. 

'And I wouldn't put that down to whoever is the next captain or one person in his position because for me there will never be another Steven Gerrard.’
