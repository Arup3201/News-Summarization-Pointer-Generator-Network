U.S. soldiers at a remote base in Afghanistan were left outraged after a large cross outside a chapel was taken down because it broke Army rules.

Servicemen at Camp Marmal in northern Afghanistan, a German base for NATO forces, said they found the cross ‘inspiring’ and ‘motivating’.

But the base chaplain was forced to take it down because his Army manual bans the permanent display of ‘distinctive religious symbols’.

‘Not having it there is really upsetting,’ one soldier told Politico. ‘Seeing the cross is a daily reminder of my faith and what Jesus accomplished for me.’

Another admitted that some of his fellow soldiers only get through foreign deployments because they can openly express their faith.

‘The chapel is the one place that feels like home,’ one soldier told Politico, adding that is a 'constant reminder for all of us that Jesus is here for us'.

One soldier claimed the chaplain simply told him he ‘had to take it down’ - and a Pentagon spokesman confirmed it was removed.

‘The removal was, in fact, in accordance with Army regulations,’ Commander William Speaks told Politico.

The Pentagon claimed the cross had been in place since mid-October but soldiers talking to Politico said it had been there for longer. The U.S. Army supervises the interfaith chapel.

Soldiers said there were no complaints about the cross from Muslims or Jews on the base, but the Pentagon told Fox News that there was one.

‘I really don’t understand why Christians are always attacked,’ a soldier told Politico, adding that a crescent moon on a mosque would have stayed put.
