'Living nightmare': Veteran BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall today vowed to battle sex offence allegations

Stuart Hall told yesterday how he had been driven to the brink of suicide by ‘spurious’ claims of rape and indecent assault.

The veteran broadcaster, 83, spoke out as he arrived at court to face one charge of raping a young woman and 14 counts of indecent assault against children as young as nine.

But, for the first time since allegations against him surfaced, the Radio 5 Live commentator defended himself, saying he had been through a ‘living nightmare’.

He said: ‘May I just say these allegations are pernicious, callous, cruel and above all spurious.‘And may I just say I am not guilty and will be defending these accusations.’ 

The sports pundit also questioned why it had taken almost four decades for the allegations to be made against him and defiantly vowed to clear his name.

He added: ‘Like a lot of other people in this country today I am wondering why it has taken 30 or 40 years for these allegations to surface.

‘The last two months of my life have been a living nightmare. I have never gone through so much stress in my life and I am finding it difficult to sustain.’

An emotional Hall added: ‘Fortunately I have a very loving family and they are very supportive and I think, but for their love, I might have been constrained to take my own life. They have encouraged me to fight on, to fight the charges and regain my reputation and good name and whatever I have represented to this country down the years.

‘I would like to thank everybody who has supported me for their good will which has sustained me through this absolutely horrific ordeal.’ 

The former It’s A Knockout presenter said he was nursing a heart complaint brought on by the stress of the ordeal.

‘As I say, I shall be defending 
myself. I am 83 years old. I was a healthy 83-year-old, but I am now 
incubating a heart complaint and I’ll be very lucky to survive another 
couple of years,’ he said.

‘But I hope to survive those two years and regain my honour and reputation and more than ever, my life.’ 

Hall, dressed in a navy suit, entered
no plea during the five minute hearing at Preston Magistrates Court. He
spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. Prosecutor 
Joanne Cunliffe called for the case to be sent to the Crown court 
because the allegations were too serious to be dealt with before 
magistrates.

The rape is alleged to have been in 
1976 on a 22-year-old and the 14 indecent assault offences are reported 
to have been committed between 1967 and 1986. They concern ten girls 
aged between nine and 16.

Hall had already been charged in 
December with indecently assaulting three girls. These charges included 
an alleged assault of an eight-year-old, an 11-year-old and a woman who 
was then aged 16. The allegations cover the period between 1974 and 
1984.

The arrest of the commentator, who 
lives with his wife of 44 years, Hazel, in Wilmslow, Cheshire, came as 
the BBC continues to deal with the fallout from the Jimmy Savile sex 
abuse scandal. Police said it did not form part of Operation Yewtree, 
the investigation into alleged sex offences by Savile and others.

'The
last two months of my life have been a living nightmare. I have never 
gone through so much stress in my life and I am finding it difficult to 
sustain. Fortunately I have a very loving family and they are very 
supportive and I think but for their love I might have been constrained 
to take my own life'

Gary Glitter, 68, comedian Freddie 
Starr, 69, DJ Dave Lee Travis, 67, and former BBC producer Wilfred 
De’Ath, 73, have been arrested and bailed as part of that probe.

Other celebrity arrests include 
comedian Jim Davidson, 59, and PR guru Max Clifford, 69. All deny any 
wrongdoing. Hall has previously said that he believes the pursuit of 
celebrities by the police has led to a string of allegations being made 
against him.

Speaking outside Hall’s home last 
month, his solicitor Louise Straw said: ‘The clear pursuit of 
celebrities – an 83-year-old in this instance – raises concerns about 
fairness and equal treatment.’ 
Hall, known for his distinctively 
highbrow approach to football commentary on Radio 5 Live, was yesterday 
bailed to appear before Preston Crown Court on March 1.

In December, his employers at BBC 
Radio 5 Live announced he would not be working for them while the 
investigation was continuing.

Hall and his wife, who have two grown-up children, Daniel, 50, and Francesca, 52, are popular among the local community.

He won legions of fans in the 1970s 
and 1980s for his inimitable style and habit of breaking down in fits of
laughter during It’s a Knockout. He became an OBE in the 2012 New Year 
Honours for services to broadcasting and charity.
