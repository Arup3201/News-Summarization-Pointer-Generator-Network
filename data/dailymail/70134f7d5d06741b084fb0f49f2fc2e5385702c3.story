For the first time since 1937 a baby has been born on one of Britain's tiniest and most remote islands.

Thea Windridge-Hicks arrived 76 years after the last birth on St Agnes in the Isles of Scilly, which has had its population increased to 73.

A midwife had to take a boat from the mainland to the island after Grace Windridge, 24, went into labour while having a bath.

Historic day: Proud mother Grace Windridge with her new born baby Thea Windridge-Hicks, the first child to be born on St Agnes in the Isles of Scilly since 1937

Distant idyll: St Agnes is one of the most distant parts of the UK and has 73 people living there permanently, half the population there 150 years ago

Pregnant women living on the islands normally travel to St Mary's, the largest of the islands, or Cornwall to give birth as there are no doctors or hospitals on St Agnes.

But parents Grace and Aiden Hicks, 24, who have a three-year-old son Joss, had planned a home birth.

The last person to have been born on St Agnes was Janice Nicholas, 76, who moved from the island several years ago.

Delighted Grace said: 'It was absolutely fantastic and went exactly how we wished it to.

'It felt extra special being able to give birth to our little girl on the island which we plan to bring her up on.

'Because my first labour was so quick we thought it would be best to plan the birth at home as we would have had to get a helicopter to the hospital on the mainland.

'It's really fortunate we did as there is no way we would have been able to get to the mainland in time for Thea to be born.'

She's a beauty: Thea is the first child born on the island since the 1930s after her mum opted for a home birth and a midwife who sped there by boat

Growing family: Thea's big brother Joss keeps a protective eye on the one-week-old little girl

One of the five inhabited islands that make up the Isles of Scilly, St Agnes is an archipelago 28 miles off Lands End - the most South Westerly point of the British Isles.

Its gloriously mild weather, bracing pollution-free sea air and abundant flora, all thanks to the nearby path of the Gulf Stream, make it one of the nicest places to live the UK

St Agnes, a small flower farming community, is completely untouched.

Birds, butterflies and wildflowers abound practically all year round here, including many rare species not found elsewhere in the UK.

Its main industry is tourism and this is reflected in its amenities, with several B&Bs, a tiny post office and a pub, the Turks Head. 

Its most famous landmark is the lighthouse (pictured) which has been keeping shipping safe since 1680.

She went into labour while 
having a bath on October 5 and she called her fiance Aiden, an 
electrician, who took her into the living room.

He
called midwife Annie, who is stationed at St Mary's, who got a boat to 
the island as soon as possible and arrived just in time.

Thea was born on the couple's living room floor at around 1pm on October 5 weighing a healthy 7lb 12oz.

Stay
at home motherGrace said: 'We thought at one point that Aiden would have 
to deliver the baby himself as everything was happening so fast.

'But
we had a home birthing kit ready and Annie told Aiden exactly what to 
do so we felt fully prepared .Aiden was fantastic and managed to stay 
very calm until Annie got to us.

'It felt so special to give birth at home as it meant Joss was able to come over straight after to meet his little sister.

'Aiden was bought up on the island so has a lot of family here who were also able to meet Thea very soon after birth.'

Grace is originally from Leicester and the engaged couple met when Grace got a summer job on the island aged 16.

The tiny island of St Agnes is the southernmost populated island of the Isles of Scilly and is only one mile long.

Though
amenities are limited, the island has a few B&Bs and self-catering 
cottages, an ice cream shop, a campsite, a small post office general 
store and a gift shop.

The island also has a pub and a cafe, although these are closed in the winter.
