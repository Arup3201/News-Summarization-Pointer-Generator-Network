Technology has already changed the way we communicate, but now it's revolutionising the way we fall - and stay - in love.

From gadgets that let you hold hands with distant loved ones to watches that share your heartbeat - the future of relationships is getting a lot more hi-tech.

But despite being heralded as a new era in expressing our affections, some experts have warned that a reliance on apps, gadgets and robots will leave us emotionally stunted.

‘Everything that is useful has within it the potential to be abused. So there are dangers ... just as there are with cars, trains and ships,’ said robotics expert Professor Martin Smith.

When one user squeezes their Frebble (pictured), the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other.

WRIST TO WRIST 

Apple is on of the first major firms to push 'virtual connection'.

Its Apple Watch, expected to launch in spring next year, includes a feature called 'Digital Touch' that lets wearers 'communicate without words.' 

Apple said it offers 'fun, spontaneous ways to connect with other Apple Watch wearers, wrist to wrist.'

Researchers recently claimed people are so engrossed in their phones, they are unable to accurately read how people are feeling in real-life.

This is the result of less face-to-face time interaction, according to a psychologist at the Children's Digital Media Center.

It found children in particular are glued to electronic devices for nearly five hours each day, and this could be leaving them emotionally stunted.

A separate study recently found that we spend more time on our smartphones than with our partner.

The average smartphone user tends to spend two hours (119 minutes) a day using their gadget, the study found.

Yet, the amount of time we spend with our other halves per day is just 97 minutes - a third less - on average.

The study, from network operator O2 looked at exactly what we use our phones for and how much time each activity takes each day. 

This includes being able to sketch messages to a friend, send voice memos, and also the ability to send a heartbeat. 

It reads a user's heart rate, using a built-in sensor, before sending it to a fellow wearer, who feels the heartbeat on their wrist. 

HOLD HANDS... EVEN IF YOU'RE 100 MILES AWAY 

Elsewhere, people who want to hold hands with someone miles away can buy a pair of Freebles.

When one user squeezes their Frebble, the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. 

When combined with Skype, for example, the experience is said to be 'immersive'.

Oculus Rift is also changing the way gamers virtually interact with characters - or even fake girlfriends.

LIE ON YOUR VIRTUAL GIRLFRIEND'S LAP 

Earlier this year, Japanese firm Up Frontier unveiled a bizarre pillow, shaped like a pair of girl's legs.

When used with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, it lets men sit next to a virtual girlfriend, 'touch' them and rest their head on her lap. 

Each of the virtual partners are based on the Unity-chan cartoon character, which is the mascot for an open-source cross-platform game engine called Unity designed by Unity Technologies Japan.

This 'lap pillow' mimics the shape of these character's legs.

Although many companies have attempted to create gadgets that help virtually connect loved ones, Apple became one of the first major firms to feature it in an upcoming product. Its Apple Watch includes being able to sketch messages to a friend (left), send voice memos but also the ability to send a heartbeat (right)

... OR EVEN FEEL HER BREASTS

The same firm also released a virtual breast simulator. 

This consisted of a model with a fake pair of breasts fitted with pressure sensors, and which connects to an Oculus Rift headset.

When the wearer squeezes the model's breasts, a virtual character squeals with shock and places her arms over her chest. 

CYBER HUGS ALL ROUND 

Elsewhere in Japan, a tech firm recently invented a chair that can hug people. 

Research has scientifically proven that receiving and giving hugs releases the body's natural 'love drug', oxytocin, calming the nervous system and boosting positive emotions.

The 'tranquility chair' is essentially a fabric doll built into a rocking chair. 

And its creators believe it could be particularly useful for the elderly and those who live alone.

THE SEEDY SIDE OF TECHNOLOGY 

Meanwhile, although cybersex isn't a new phenomenon, companies are looking at ways to make porn more immersive.

Family meals have been decimated by technology, with children often spending their entire time tapping away on their phone - if they can be removed from their bedroom to come to the table at all.

However, a free app claims to be able to solve the problem - by locking their gadgets at meal times.

The free DinnerTime app can show children how long they have, then lock their phone - and even show them how long is left until they can leave the table. 

Adult streaming platform SugarDVD, for example, recently announced it's building an app for Oculus Rift that will 'put viewers into the action.' 

And a recent study alluded to the fact that within 10 years humans could even start swapping human partners for robots. 

More than a quarter of the participants of a University of Middlesex study said they thought robots or intelligent computers would be capable of feeling human emotions in the future.

And almost half (46 per cent) thought technology was evolving too quickly and ‘undermining traditional ways of life.’

‘Everything that is useful has within it the potential to be abused. So there are dangers inherent in robots; just as there are with cars, trains and ships,’ said Professor Martin Smith who led the study. 

‘It has been said that when robots become more intelligent than us, if we are lucky, they might keep us as pets. If we are unlucky they might treat us in the same way as we treat chickens, pigs and cows.’

The rise of the machines was embraced by at least 17 per cent of those questioned who said they'd happily have sex with an android, while 29 per cent admitted they had no problem with other people enjoying android sex.

More than one in 10 even said they would like a robot child, similar to David in the 2001 movie A.I., and replacing a beloved animal with a robot appealed to nearly a fifth of pet owners. 

1. Military/soldiers (45 per cent)

2. Industry/factory workers and labourers (33 per cent)

3. Space exploration/astronauts (33 per cent)

4. Domestic chores/cleaners (23 per cent)

5. Motoring/chauffeurs and taxi drivers (20 per cent)

6. Policing/policemen and women (10 per cent)

7. Transport/train driver, pilots, truckers (8 per cent)

8. Service industry/shop assistant, customer service, waiters, bartenders (8 per cent)

9. Sex and sex workers (4 per cent)

10. Cooking/chefs (3 per cent)

TECHNOLOGY TEARING US APART? 

However, despite these technological connections, researchers recently claimed people are so engrossed in their phones, they are unable to accurately read how people are feeling in real-life.

This is the result of less face-to-face time interaction, according to a psychologist at the Children's Digital Media Center.

It found children in particular are glued to electronic devices for nearly five hours each day, and this could be leaving them emotionally stunted.

The study, from network operator O2 looked at exactly what we use our phones for and how much time each activity takes each day. 

In families, too, meals have been decimated by technology, with children often spending their entire time tapping away on their phone - if they can be removed from their bedroom to come to the table at all. 

ZeroDesktop recently released a free app that claims to be able to solve the problem - by locking their gadgets at meal times.
