Carlos Arredondo, a volunteer in the Boston Marathon bombings who was captured in a famous image helping victim and amputee Jeff Bauman, settled a police brutality case on Tuesday.

Arredondo claimed in a civil complaint seen by the Boston Herald that four Boston officersÂ  'dragged' him to the sidewalk when he refused to move his truck from police headquarters during a 2009 funeral procession for Sen. Ted Kennedy.

Officer 
David Roberto, Franciso Rodriguez, Bienvendio Delacruz and Dana Lamb 
'[threw him] to the pavement, facedown, and handcuffed with his arms 
behind his back,' the complaint said.

Arredondo, the paper reports, refused to move because he was going to take down a flag down from a pole and wait for wife Melida. Arredondo's car was 'decorated as a shrine' for his son Alexander, who died while fighting in the Marine Corps in Iraq.

Arredondo and City Hall agreed on an undisclosed sum after a five-hour mediation, the Herald says. Arrendondo, his attorney Bruce Macdonald, as well as city attorneys, did not comment.

Last Saturday, Arredondo appeared alongside Bauman as a commencement speaker at Fisher College. Both received honorary degrees.

In his speech with Bauman, Arredondo said 'I hope that my actions motivate others simply to love their neighbors through actions, good works and in times of need.'
