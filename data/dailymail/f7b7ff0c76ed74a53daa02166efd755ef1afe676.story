Liverpool defender Jose Enrique took to Instagram to announce his shock at being charged £9.50 for a glass of orange juice, the morning after his side's 1-0 Premier League win against Sunderland.

The Spaniard uploaded a picture of the receipt, showing that he had to pay £5.50 for the drink itself and another £4 for a 'tray charge'.

'The most expensive glass of orange juice ever,' Enrique wrote. 'They must have brought it from Spain walking.'

But Enrique, who was an unused substitute in the game at the Stadium of Light on Saturday, took some flack from his followers on the social network site for his moan.

The defender is reportedly earning £65,000 a week at Liverpool, so while £9.50 is unquestionably extortionate, it is not going to hurt his wallet too much.

Liverpool's next match sees them travel to the midlands on Saturday to take on Aston Villa, as Brendan Rodgers' side looks to continue their pursuit of top four finish.
