The World Cup is fast approaching and the tournament promises to be an epic, glorious spectacle. Overall, the game is growing and is in good health, but here are five New Year wishes for rugby — based on fundamental domestic and global issues...

On the home front, the Aviva Premiership has just enjoyed a glittering festive weekend which showcased its tribal appeal.

There were full houses all around — including a crowd of 82,000 at Twickenham for Harlequins v Northampton, which was the biggest sporting attendance in the country. Television ratings are up, many matches are producing thrilling and explosive action founded on a large core of English talent, and the scourge of crushingly predictable results which afflicts many leagues has been largely avoided.

The appeal of Rugby Union is strong, most evident with Premier League matches selling out at Twickenham

In the recent round of Christmas-cracker fixtures, five of the six games were settled by a combined margin of 23 points, but the exception to this photo-finish rule highlighted the major black mark against the Premiership’s good name.

London Welsh lost 24-9 at London Irish, which was in fact a heroic triumph when taken in the context of their miserable season.

The Oxford-based Exiles are doomed to a prompt return to the Championship, having already conceded 514 points in just 11 matches in the top division. That they are sadly out of their depth is abundantly clear and it paints the competition in a bad light, as the gulf needn’t be so stark.

Welsh receive just £1.5million in central funding, compared to the £4m which is handed out to their league rivals. This imbalance, which creates a horribly uneven playing field, is based on a convoluted shares system and has led to accusations from one MP that Premiership Rugby is operating a ‘cartel’, at the expense of promoted clubs.

Either Bristol or Worcester will come up from the Championship at the end of this season and they are both handsomely funded, so the imbalance won’t have such a profound impact, but it should be addressed and changed nonetheless.

The shares scheme is a throw-back to a newly-professional club game finding its feet, but PRL and its members have increasing TV revenue and gate receipts, so the funding should be universal, to remove this basic lack of sporting fairness. There has been a renewed debate about the merit of the salary cap in recent weeks, but instead of attempting to polarise the Premiership, the priority should be to support the weakest.

Officiating in rugby is in a mess — crippled by no-discretion edicts and uncertainty about how best to harness technology. This column does not possess the answers, but it can certainly highlight the pressing problems.

There needs to be absolute, global clarity about the use of Television Match Officials and some common sense applied to the witch-hunt against ‘dangerous’ tackles, some of which are nothing of the sort. 

Referees must resume policing scrum feeds and forward passes (to hell with the nonsense about ‘momentum’, it’s either forward or it’s not), and further crack down on time-wasting at the base of rucks.

And the creeping menace of players diving or demanding that opponents are shown cards must be emphatically, swiftly eradicated.

Fixture congestion is arguably the biggest threat to the sport, as it has such a wide-ranging impact. Player welfare is in danger as never before due to the excessive demands placed on those at the elite level, especially in Europe.

Measures to improve concussion awareness and treatment are to be applauded, but the toll of serious injuries keeps rising. Bodies are breaking under the strain. Clubs and countries want their pound of flesh, but the regular absence of star players reduces the quality of the game.

Too many Tests are being played to prop up unions’ finances and as well as causing injuries, it dilutes interest. Less can be more. This column continues to advocate a global season based on summer rugby in the northern hemisphere. One day, maybe...

Twickenham will be among the 13 stadiums which will play host to the 2015 Rugby World Cup

The thorny issue of made-for-TV kick-off times may well come to a head during the World Cup, due to the alarming prospect of night matches at Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium.

England’s opener against Fiji could bring transport chaos as it clashes with the weekly horror of the Friday evening rush-hour. In London, Cardiff and elsewhere, roads and trains will struggle with the task of ferrying fans home from venues.

Next month, Wales host England on a Friday night, which means another motorway marathon for those crossing the Severn Bridge from the east. At club level, the new European Champions Cup features games on Sunday evenings. Broadcasters have their wall-to-wall coverage, but the wishes of spectators, especially those travelling from afar, are compromised. Sadly, the trend won’t be reversed until screens are filled with empty stands.

England, celebrating the 2003 World Cup triumph, are the only Northern Hemisphere side to win the title

The scoreline stands at 6-1 to the South when it comes to World Cup titles. New Zealand, Australia and South Africa have each won the event twice, with only England in 2003 breaking this SANZAR grip on the Webb Ellis Cup. Here’s hoping for a Northern uprising in 2015. Ireland turned the tables on the raiders from the far side of the equator during the autumn, Stuart Lancaster’s England are capable of lowering the colours of any visitor at home and Wales may believe anything is possible now by beating the Springboks.

France can conquer any team if the mood takes them, and even Scotland are equipped to dish out the odd bloody nose.

The annual circus of hearing Kiwi players in particular reveal a total lack of awareness about the game in these parts is depressing and infuriating.

Only beating them makes them take notice and show due respect. That would be a welcome development.
