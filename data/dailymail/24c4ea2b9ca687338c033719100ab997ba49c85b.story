Living with a snoring partner can be nothing short of torture.

But former BBC journalist Rosie Millard claims to have found a cure to a problem which plagues millions of couples.

Miss Millard says she was forced to search for a remedy after her husband recently began to snore, preventing her from sleeping.

Problem solved: Rosie Millard and husband Pip Clothier who tried the Good Night Snoring Ring

Rather than use remedies such as nasal strips and mouth sprays, the mother of four says she persuaded her husband, 53-year-old TV producer Pip Clothier, to try the Good Night Snoring Ring, which works by applying acupressure to the wearer’s finger.

She claims that the £30 silver device fixed the problem almost immediately.

On her website, 47-year-old Miss Millard, BBC art correspondent between 1995 and 2004, said: ‘Mr Millard didn’t always snore. But recently, it’s been a bit noisy chez nous. So, he has tried two things. This is the first. The Good Night Snoring Ring.

‘As you can see, the ring has a 
little dimple on one side, and a sort of shelf on the other. These are 
crucial. They are twin acupressure points.

'Rather
 like those car-sickness bands which press key positions on the 
underside of your wrist (and work brilliantly), the snore ring does the 
same on your finger.

‘Thirty minutes before slumber time, 
The Snorer should place the ring at the base of his/her little finger 
with the gap facing upwards.

'The
 overall effect is that your partner is suddenly wearing a signet ring. 
Very posh.

'If you like this Downton effect, great. If you don’t, never 
mind. Just turn over and go to sleep. You will not be disturbed. 

‘In the morning, the ring comes off. You must not wear it during the day. Who knew?’

Miss Millard says the problem might also have been alleviated by a second measure. 

Her husband has taken up regular cycling, helping him lose weight.

Around one in four women and four in ten men are frequent snorers, while half the population is said to snore occasionally.

A recent US study has claimed that 
snorers are more likely to have a heart attack than smokers or the 
obese, and the condition could thicken the arteries, leading to brain 
haemorrhages, strokes and heart attacks.
