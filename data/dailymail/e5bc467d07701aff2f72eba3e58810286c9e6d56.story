Bali's pro-death penalty governor doesn't want Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran executed on his island, because it could be bad for business.

Made Mangku Pastika, a former head of Indonesia's national narcotics agency, testified against members of the Bali Nine in a 2007 challenge of their death sentences, believed that the Australians’ execution on the island would spoil the harmonious relationship between the two countries.

Indonesia is set to confirm it had a record one million visits from Australians in 2014, the vast majority of them to Bali.

A time and place is yet to be set for the executions. But General Pastika says they shouldn't be carried out in Bali. 

‘If it's possible, please not in Bali, just somewhere else," he told reporters, without giving his reasons.

‘I think they want Bali to keep in harmony, remain safe, remain peaceful. So if possible, not in Bali, please.’

It’s a change of tact for General Pastika who when testifying against members of the Bali Nine in a 2007 challenge of their death sentences described drug traffickers as ‘mass murderers’ who were deserving of death. 

The families of Chan and Sukumaran (seen as a child in picture above) are pleading for mercy

Sukumaran and Chan have now been denied presidential clemency and only a last-ditch legal bid stands between them and the firing squad.  

Their families have made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates.

On Thursday, Chan's last-ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Joko Widodo , following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia.

General Pastika made it clear he was against the executions taking place on the island saying:  'If it's possible, please not in Bali, just somewhere else.'

The decision comes as Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie and Alan Jones, have joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities. 

Relatives of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.

Raji Sukumaran, Myuran's mother, said that she was 'sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed' if he saw their efforts towards reforming themselves and every aspect of the running of the jail. 

Mrs Sukumaran told The Sydney Morning Herald that she was confident that if the president could see how much they had changed he would put a stop to the executions, which have been scheduled to happen this year. 

Ranjini Sukumaran, the mother of Bali Nine ringleader Myuran Sukumaran, said that he is a different person

The pair have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases.

Their families said that they were at a loss to deal with a prison system that was not structurally built to recognise the efforts of prisoners to reform themselves, but hoped that this would change.

Myuran's younger brother Chinthu Sukumaran said that Indonesian authorities needed to actually visit the prison to see the changes that had occured.

'Everyone who goes in there and spends a couple of minutes, they are just very impressed,' he said.

The pair have dedicated much of their time to advocating against the very illegal activity that landed them in jail- drugs.

Chan and Sukumaran have also instigated tertiary courses in computer studies, arts, English, and graphic design.

Sukumaran is only a year away from completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts through Monash University, and along with Chan has aided the introduction of cooking, philosophy and psychology lessons and a first aid course.

Bali locals have made a show of support, coming out to buy Sukumaran's art in the wake of his rejected clemency appeal. 

His mother made an emotional appeal on Saturday, speaking of how sorry her son was and how much he had changed as an individual.

'No mother should have to go through this, it's killing us. Please, something has to be done, please help,' Channel Seven reported Mrs Sukumaran as saying.

When testifying against members of the Bali Nine in a 2007 challenge of their death sentences,  General Pastika described drug traffickers as ‘mass murderers’ 

Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified'.

'I've been told my son will be taken out and shot at any time. I don't know what to do. He doesn't deserve to die.' 

The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. 

Chan and Sukumaran are still hoping that a last-ditch legal bid stands between them and a firing squad 

They have been informed that when they are executed they will face the firing squad together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia.

'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days.

'There are no words that would make it better, [it's] just to be there with him,' he said.  

Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke to both men's families on Friday and said the Australian government was 'continuing to make every possible effort' to stop the executions.

Mrs Sukumaran did not comment on what's being done to try to save her son but said she had full confidence in the Australian government.

'I'm not giving up and I know the Australian government will do everything it can to bring the boys home or even to stop the execution,' she said.

'They can't do this to them.'  

Andrew Chan's brother Michael said he was not giving up hope because 'there are things that are being done' that would remain 'behind closed doors'.

But the reality of his 31-year-old brother's fate was hitting home.

'The last couple of days have probably been worse for wear,' he said.

'I don't think I've felt this way, probably, since the beginning when it first all happened. But to know that we're sort of nearing the end of the road is heartbreaking.'   

Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006

Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th

Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution

Despite Indonesian President Joko Widodo vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said earlier in the week that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed.

'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said.

'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC.   

If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. 

The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest.  

Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot.

'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said.

Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad.  

Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.'

'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan. 

Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them.

'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said.

News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf.
