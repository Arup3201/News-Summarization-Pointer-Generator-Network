Guilty: Michael Barrymore, pictured arriving at court today, told the police officer: 'don't you think I've had enough f****** s*** from you lot over the years'

Entertainer Michael Barrymore tried to hide a stash of cocaine in his mouth after drunkenly telling police 'don't you think I've had enough f****** s*** from you lot over the years, I know the law', a court heard today.

The entertainer, 59, was found by police after his Citroen DS hit a kerb in Acton, west London, and he launched into a foul-mouthed verbal attack as they tried to question him about who was driving.

Police discovered the damaged vehicle while on a routine patrol with Barrymore - real name Michael Parker - and another man standing by it.

He was arrested after abusing the officers - and then tried to hide a stash of cocaine in his mouth at a police station, Ealing Magistrates Court heard.

The entertainer was fined £680 for possessing the Class A drug, ordered to pay £100 costs  and a £15 victim surcharge.

A second charge, of being drunk and disorderly, was withdrawn. He was held by the officers on November 22 at 4.30am.

Prosecutor Sally Peters said: 'The Citroen was a hired vehicle registered to Mr Parker.

'Therefore they went to speak to him to see if he had any knowledge of the driver of the vehicle. He was asked and he said "I am not answering you."

'It was then noted that he smelt strongly of alcohol. He then proceeded to be very abusive towards officers and told them, "don't you think I have had enough f****** s*** from you lot over the years, I know the law".'

The television star was arrested and taken to a police custody suite where he was seen trying to hide a white substance in his mouth.

Ms Peters added: 'He refused to spit it out. He was then stripped searched and a rock of white power was found in his pocket. Mr Parker tested positive for cocaine.'

Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and maroon tie, the star appeared shaky as he sat in the dock at Ealing Magistrates Court, looking nervously towards the gathered press and fumbling with the front of his suit jacket.

Earlier, the hearing was briefly adjourned after Barrymore's lawyer objected to his address being read out in court, citing 'intense attention' surrounding his client.

Magistrates declined permission for the address to be withheld however, and Richard Gowthorpe gave it as Fleet Street in central London.

Explaining their refusal to allow the address to be withheld, Chair of the Bench Moira Edmonds said: 'We won't be guided by any sort of sympathy for well-being.'

Mr Gowthrope said only a 'very small amount' of cocaine was involved and added that the entertainer had apologised to police for his behaviour.

While he now had a criminal conviction, his client had entered the court a man of good character, he noted.

'In many ways it's a sad day for Mr Parker to be before the courts and he's pleaded guilty to this offence,' he said.

'Certainly he will be punished to a degree by the conviction itself.'

Barrymore had urged his lawyer to 
point out that the evening in question had been 'exceptional' and that 
'there was an exceptional set of circumstances' at the time, Mr 
Gowthorpe added.

'This behaviour is wholly out of character. This is not part of a general lifestyle that Mr Parker is living.

'He's addressing the problem, he's addressing the temptation and there's no present drug use.'

Andrew de Cruze, from the Drugs Intervention Team, said that Barrymore had come to see them.

'Mr Parker did take the opportunity to come voluntarily,' he said.

'Since his arrest he has attended regularly. He has been very open with the team whilst being with them and has been honest about his circumstances. He has made good progress.'

He added that Barrymore was undergoing a cognitive behaviour therapy programme which 'is something Mr Parker has fond very helpful and he feels willing to engage in that process.

'He is also addressing the use of alcohol by attending meetings.'

Mr Gowthorpe added: 'Perhaps in a degree we are all flawed and Mr Parker is no exception. With the help of his family and friends he is progressing.'

Once one of Britain's highest-paid small screen stars, Barrymore has had a controversial career.

In the early 1980s, shows such as Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People attracted up to 13 million viewers and made him one of the best-known faces on TV, with a pay packet to match.

But in 1995 he announced he was gay and split from Cheryl, his manager and wife of 19 years, and his career foundered.

Less than a decade later, in 2004, the former Butlins Red Coat filed for bankruptcy.

More recently, he appeared on TV as a housemate on Celebrity Big Brother.

Public reaction to his appearance in 2006 was mixed but he was popular enough with viewers to take second place behind 'spoof' celebrity Chantelle Houghton.
