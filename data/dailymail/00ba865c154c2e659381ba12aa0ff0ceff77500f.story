The scale of West Bromwich Albion’s success in finding three wins in eight days can be measured by the changing chants from the Hawthorns stands.

Head coach Alan Irvine was asked for a wave and captain Chris Brunt heard his name sung.

During their previous Premier League home match — a defeat by Everton — Irvine was booed and Brunt jeered.

Since then, however, Tottenham and Hull have been defeated and this rout, the club’s biggest win since February 2012, boosted the feelgood factor as much as their league position. True, Burnley provided weak opposition but some of West Brom’s attacking play, spearheaded by Saido Berahino, suggested the good times can continue.

Man of the match: Saido Berahino

Referee: Jon Moss 6. 

This was the first time since November 2012 that Albion have recorded three consecutive victories in all competitions and they leapt from 17th place to 10th in one afternoon.

Berahino scored twice to become the leading English marksman in the top flight with four goals and back up his pre-match claim that to win senior international honours is not an unrealistic ambition.

With Roy Hodgson’s assistant Ray Lewington and England coach Gary Neville in the stands it is feasible the 21-year-old could be given a call-up for next month’s European qualifiers — particularly with Daniel Sturridge recovering from injury and Rickie Lambert faltering.

England manager Hodgson knows Berahino from his time at West Brom. ‘If he keeps on playing like that he’ll get all those rewards,’ said Irvine. ‘I don’t think Roy will be looking and saying he’s too young but right now Saido has just got to keep working as he does.’

Berahino, with eight goals in 11 games for England Under 21s, nodded in from two yards on the stroke of half-time to make it 2-0 and then applied a precise finish 11 minutes after the interval.

Craig Dawson had opened the scoring in the 31st minute and Graham Dorrans grabbed the goal his performance deserved with a clinical shot in the final minute.

‘We won’t get carried away,’ said Berahino. ‘We will focus and go to Liverpool (on Saturday) and make sure we get something there.’

For Burnley the worry is they have added defensively fragility to their limited offensive capabilities. This was their fifth Premier League game in a row without scoring, making it 526 minutes since Scott Arfield hit their only goal of the season against Chelsea.

Three points had been accrued via goalless draws to give Sean Dyche’s side the joint best defensive record in the division alongside Southampton going into this match. But their resistance crumbled spectacularly here.

‘That’s a massive learning curve,’ said Dyche, shorn of his usual midfield through injuries to David Jones and Dean Marney. ‘We were carrying too many players today.’

Burnley’s poor scoring record must be a huge concern. ‘That needs to be dealt with,’ he said. ‘Players get that weird feeling, “When are we going to score?”

‘One of the big mantras I say to the players is, “Be the man who makes a difference”.’

Irvine stuck with the team that won 1-0 at Spurs and it paid off. Dawson got the ball rolling, scoring against the club who tried three times to buy him in the summer. The defender should be glad his transfer request was rejected. Dawson rose higher than Jason Shackell to head in Brunt’s corner for his first West Brom goal.

Albion’s second came from the same source, although this time James Morrison delivered the corner, Dorrans flicked on and Berahino applied the final nod.

Then Berahino got his second with a neat finish across Tom Heaton and though Burnley tried to claw their way back into the game, West Brom keeper Ben Foster did well to save from Lukas Jutkiewicz.

West Brom supporters have taken to serenading their head coach with the chant, ‘Alan ****ing Irvine’, and did so again as the football flowed.

‘I’ve probably been called that a few times but not so much in that context,’ said the Glaswegian with a smile. He hopes the fans keep having cause to turn the air blue with joy.
