She once tackled secret agents who had a licence to kill.

Now former Bond girl Fiona Fullerton has been given a licence... to fell – and it’s landed her in hot water with her neighbours.

They have accused her of ‘vandalism’ over plans to chop down two towering trees as part of renovations to her £900,000 Regency mansion.

Miss
 Fullerton, 57, insists she is simply following guidance from council 
officers, who said the 70-year-old cypresses are unsafe.

But
 homeowners near the Gloucestershire pile believe they should be saved 
and have accused the actress-turned-property guru of putting profit 
before the community.

The 
Strictly Come Dancing contestant and husband Neil Shackell bought St 
John’s Lodge last year after the Grade II listed property, formerly used
 as an architect’s office, went on the market for £895,000.

And after 
submitting plans to turn it back into a six-bedroom home a tree 
preservation officer told them the trees were unsafe and ‘inappropriate 
for the area’.

Ms Fullerton says she is just following guidance from council officers who said the 70-year-old trees are unsafe.

‘We also 
took advice from three tree surgeons and one of the trees is old and 
unsafe,’ said Miss Fullerton, adding: ‘We are just doing what we have 
been directed to do. The trees will be replaced with Holm oaks, fitting 
in with the ones across the road. If neighbours have any concerns we are
 happy to talk to them about it.’

Miss
 Fullerton, who appeared on Strictly last year, added on Twitter 
yesterday: ‘They are cypress leylandii which are wrong for the area.’

The former Bond girl, who starred as a KGB spy in 1985 film A View to a 
Kill alongside Roger Moore, is now described as a ‘property queen’.

She 
has a ‘small portfolio’ of flats, houses and offices in London and 
Oxford and has written books with titles like How to Make Money From 
Your Property.

Sarah Knightly Brown, pictured, who has lived alongside the star's home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, for 30 years,  dubbed the trees 'iconic'

But she denies that her current project in Cheltenham was about making a quick buck, insisting: ‘It’s going to be our home.’

Sarah
 Knightly Brown, who has lived near the property for 30 years, described
 the trees as ‘iconic’.

She said: ‘The greenery of this area is what 
makes it so special. If you look at this road, the old trees are so 
important to the way it looks.

Refute: Ms Fuller flatly denied this project was about making a quick profit

Felling them will change the whole 
atmosphere. A lot of residents feel very strongly about this. We don’t 
want these trees to go. They are iconic and have been there ever since I
 moved in.’

Peter Swales, 
chairman of Cheltenham Bridge Club, who also lives by the property, 
added: ‘Felling these trees basically amounts to vandalism. It’s just 
property developers making some cash without a care for the community.’ 
Lindsey Mulraine, tree officer at Cheltenham Borough Council, said the 
cypresses had ‘reached the end of their useful life’. She added: ‘It is a
 shame to lose these two trees, but it was felt they were not worthy of a
 preservation order.

‘We did publicise the proposed works and no objections were received.’

Twice
 married Miss Fullerton sold her previous £2.5million home in the 
Cotswolds because she couldn’t face living in an ‘empty nest’ with no 
children, she explained last year.
