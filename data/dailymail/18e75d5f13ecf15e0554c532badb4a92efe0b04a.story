Australia is the most popular destination for British expats - with 1.2 million living Down Under. 

The US and Canada come in second and third place - with 700,000 and 675,000 Brits living there, according to a new infographic.

The research shows sunny Spain, which was the second most popular destination for a decade, has fallen out of favour with numbers decreasing rapidly in recent years.

The majority of Britons leave the country for more than four years, with those uprooting to other European countries being more likely to stay longer, according to the infographic by www.currencyfair.com. 

The graphic reveals the destinations most popular with British expats, how long they intend to stay there for, reasons for leaving - as well as tips and advice about the countries of choice.

Nearly half of expats living in Australia stay for longer than four years, compared to 70 per cent of Britons now living in Spain and 75 per cent living in France.
