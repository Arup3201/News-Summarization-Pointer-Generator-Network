A Denver sheriff's deputy who helped a felon escape told co-workers that he did so because he was threatened and told there was a contract out on him
and his family, according to court records.

Deputy Matthew Andrews faces felony 
charges that he aided in Sunday night's escape of Felix Trujillo, who 
spent three days on the run after walking out of the jail in a sheriff's
deputy's baseball cap and jacket.

An arrest affidavit released Thursday
said surveillance video showed Andrews and Trujillo walking away from 
the jail together on Sunday night.

Trujillo surrendered Wednesday after 
police received a call from a third party who said Trujillo wanted to 
turn himself in. Police arrested him without incident. Trujillo was in 
court Thursday morning but remains in custody on $100,000 bond.

The court records show Trujillo faces
escape and kidnapping charges. He was awaiting sentencing on aggravated
robbery charges when he fled.

On Wednesday, police said Marilyn 
Reeves, 47, also had been arrested on charges of aiding an escape. An 
arrest warrant affidavit said Reeves told police Trujillo is a close 
friend of her son. She allegedly said Trujillo had stayed at her home 
Sunday night, the affidavit said.

Police Cmdr. Ron Saunier said 
Wednesday there could be more arrests as police investigate who helped 
Trujillo while he was at large.

According to the court records, 
Andrews said he received a phone call from an unknown person demanding 
he help Trujillo escape to spare himself and his family. After Andrews 
dropped Trujillo off, he returned to the jail, where he was found 
crying.

Sheriff Department spokesman Maj. 
Frank Gale said investigators are still trying to determine whether 
others inside the jail were involved or violated policy.

'The scope of 
the investigation is big,' he said.

Undersheriff Gary Wilson has said the
department is reviewing its policies and training to make sure such a 
situation doesn't occur again.

Andrews, a two-year-veteran of the agency who worked general security duties at the jail, is on paid leave.
