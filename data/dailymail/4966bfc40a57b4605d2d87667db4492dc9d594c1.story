It has become something of a tradition for jewellers - creating a jewel encrusted 'bling' version of Apple's handset.

A US jeweller today launch preorders for the first diamond encrusted iPhone 6 - even though Apple hasn't actually released it yet.

Brikk's Lux line of gold, platinum, and diamond-encrusted versions of the iPhone 6 will cost $4,495 to $8,795 - and owners will have to wait until a month after the 'plain' version is released.

The $8,395 version of the iPhone 6, in white finished with 24k yellow gold.

Each handset  is disassembled by Brikk.

They are hand polished, prepared and plated with five layers of diverse metals before their final plating in either two layers of gold or platinum.

The diamonds are set with a microscope in a custom-made machined bezel.

Each piece is then reassembled and tested before shipping to clients, ensuring the product meets only the highest quality control standards.

'The Lux iPhone 6 is built with the 4.7-inch, 128GB model, and is available in 24-carat yellow gold, 24-carat pink gold and pure platinum,' the firm says.

Customers can also choose to embellish the familiar Apple logo with diamonds.

Prices range from $4,495 for the plated models, to $8,395 for the plated diamond logo models; all models are packaged in a custom metal box with a user manual and all accessories standard to the device.

Brikk is taking pre-orders for the first batch of phones before the expected official launch of the iPhone 6 by the Apple Corporation in September.

A $500 deposit is required for the pre-order program.

The Lux phones are expected to ship out 3-4 weeks after the official release of the iPhone.

Even the packaging of the handset gets a makeover
