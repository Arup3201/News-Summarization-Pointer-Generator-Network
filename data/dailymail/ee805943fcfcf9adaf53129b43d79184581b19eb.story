Thailand's military junta has blocked MailOnline today after the site revealed a video of the country's Crown Prince and his wife partying.

The clip of the decadent event, which was shot at the 
Thai Royal Palace in Bangkok, shows Princess Srirasmi – a former waitress
 – cavorting in just a tiny G-string as she feeds a pet dog cake, apparently to celebrate its birthday.

It is thought publishing the video yesterday has breached lese majeste laws which outlaw offending the Thai royal family. The country's new military junta which took power last week is thought to be keen to enforce such laws strictly.

Today's clampdown came as hundreds of protesters took to the streets in the Thai 
capital today defying the junta's warning against anti-coup demonstrations.

The story that has offended Thailand's military junta and led to MailOnline being blocked

Blocked: How MailOnline appears when accessed from Thailand

The senior 
general who staged last week's coup, Prayuth Chan-ocha, responded by telling people to 
avoid rallies, saying normal democratic principles cannot be applied at 
this time.

He also defended detaining dozens of politicians and activists, including former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, most of them associated with the ousted government.

The new block on MailOnline also then followed.

One user on a Thai visa forum said: 'The site is blocked due to military coup. That's the info that comes up when trying to access the site. Was accessible a few hours ago.'

Another asked: 'How far will censorship under the coup go?'

In recent months authorities have filtered out a number of sites deemed offensive to the Thai royal family and linked to pornography, piracy and gambling.

So far there has been no official statement from Thailand's ICT Ministry on today's clampdown and the Royal Thai Embassy in London was not available to comment.

However, the British minister of state responsible for South East Asia, Hugo Swire, told MailOnline: 'I am extremely concerned at the deterioration of the democratic environment in Thailand.

'Arbitrary detentions, restrictions on local and foreign media, and limitations on freedoms of expression and assembly undermine trust in the intentions of the military leaders.

'I urge the Thai military authorities 
to provide a clear timetable for the restoration of civilian government 
by means of elections, in line with democratic values, and to respond 
proportionately to peaceful protest and dissent. In view of these 
negative developments, the UK is reviewing the scope of its cooperation 
with Thailand.'

Thailand is 
one of the world's worst countries when it comes to censoring the 
Internet. According to the Asia Sentinel, in 2010 Thailand had over 
103,000 websites blocked.

Since then Yingluck Shinawatra's government was believed to have blocked around 200,000 websites.

Facebook, YouTube, Blogger and Twitter, have been periodically 
blocked in Thailand depending which comments are offensive to the Thai 
government.

Some web pages on the BBC, CNN and Human Rights Watch have also been blocked.

Under
 Thailand's strict lese majeste rules, insulting the monarchy or a 
member of the royal family can result in jail terms of up to 15 years.

Anyone can file a lese majeste complaint, and police are duty-bound to investigate it.

And under Thailand's computer crime law, introduced in 2007, acts of defamation and posting false rumours online are punishable by five years in jail.

Recent cases have sparked fierce debates, including over a 61-year-old man who was jailed in November 2011 for 20 years for sending text messages deemed insulting to the monarchy.

Thailand is ranked 130th out of 180 countries in the 2014 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.

Journalists are being required to register by the new military authorities.

Today, Pravit Rojanaphruk, an outspoken columnist for English-language daily The Nation, tweeted that he was reporting to the junta: 'On my way to see the new dictator of Thailand. Hopefully the last.'

The military, which is already holding most of the cabinet ousted in Thursday's coup in secret locations, said it would keep former prime minister Shinawatra and others in custody for up to a week to give them 'time to think' and keep the country calm.

Starting tomorrow, those in detention who have arrest warrants or face criminal charges will be handed over for prosecution, deputy military spokesman Colonel Winthai Suvaree said.

He also said that the general 'urged every group of citizens to avoid joining the anti-coup protests because at the moment the democratic principles cannot be executed normally'.

In the three days since Thailand's first coup in eight years, the junta has faced scattered protests that came amid growing concern over its intentions.

Yesterday, the military dissolved the senate - the last functioning democratic institution left - and absorbed its legislative powers.
