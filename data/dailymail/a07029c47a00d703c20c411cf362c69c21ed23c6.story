The once iconic MP3 player that cemented Apple's place in music history - and ultimately brought about the demise of Sony's Walkman - is facing its own inevitable death.

According to the latest earnings report, Apple sold 6million iPods during last quarter, and although this was almost double the sales of the previous three months, this equated to a 52 per cent drop in sales year-on-year.

Apple also lost 55 per cent in revenue on all models of the music player, compared to the previous year, and the iPod now makes up just 2 per cent of the company's overall income.

Apple sold 6million iPods, including the fifth-generation iPod touch pictured, last quarter. The music player now makes up just 2 per cent of Apple's overall income. This equates to a 52% drop in sales year-on-year, and a 55% drop in revenue

The drop in sales is being attributed to the increase in music apps, cloud storage and streaming services including Spotify.

Additionally, Apple iPhones come with iTunes built-in, making the iPod redundant for many iPhone owners.

The trend hasn't been helped by the fact Apple hasn't released a new version of the music player since the fifth-generation Touch and seventh-generation Nano launched in 2012.

Sales of iPods were at their highest during 2008 following the launch of the first iPod Touch at the end of 2007.

The iPod Touch was designed to look like an iPhone, played music and ran apps, but could not make calls.Â 

Similar sales were seen across 2009 thanks to the launch of the third-generation Shuffle, fourth-generation Nano and second-generation Touch.

Sales began to dip in 2010, but remained steady throughout 2011 and up to the third quarter of 2012, despite no new devices being launched during that time.

The last quarter of the year is, traditionally, the best for sales across the Apple range because of the Christmas surge.

With this in mind, sales of the iPod are expected to drop significantly over the next year. However, this hasn't stopped other 
companies launching similar products, including Sony with its 
latest ZX1 refreshed version of its Walkman.

The peak in sales in 2008 was attributed to the launch of the first iPod Touch, pictured left, at the end of 2007. The iPod touch was designed to look like an iPhone, played music and ran apps, but could not make calls. This was followed by the popular, colourful fourth-generation iPod Nano, pictured right, in 2008

Apple broke all-time sales records for iPhones and iPads in the last quarter, and reported a $13.1billion profit on $57.6billion revenue. However, the figures disappointed Wall Street and analysts had expected this to be even higher

By contrast, Apple's iPhone sales 
continued to rise with 51million being sold over the holiday period - up
 7 per cent year-on-year.

A
 total of 26million iPads were also sold during the same period, up 14 
per cent year-on-year.

Yet the largest sales increase in 2013 was for 
the Mac, which celebrated its 30th birthday with a 19 per cent sales 
increase.

Despite the drop 
in iPod sales, this boost in other areas of the business resulted in 
Apple posting record-breaking profits of $13.1 billion profit on $57.6 
billion in revenue.

Following the earnings call, Apple's stock shed $41.62, or more than 7.5 per cent, to $508.88. By the end of after-hours extended trading, the shares had plummeted further putting the total loss at almost 9 per cent

This revenue is up $3.1billion compared to the same quarter last year.

Yet,
 analysts had been expecting better, and following the earnings report 
call, shares of Apple stock plummeted by 9 per cent in after-hours 
trading.

Analysts were expecting even
 bigger things and had predicted about 55 million iPhones. Apple's stock had been rising on the expectation that the company would clear the hurdle.
