Things are quickly coming to a head at The View, as one fiasco after another has resulted in a top executive of the show deciding he's had enough.

Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively that Brian Balthazar, co-executive producer of the show, is leaving to join HGTV as vice president of programming. 

The producer, who previously launched the fourth hour of the Today Show with Hoda and Kathie Lee, was responsible for day-to-day running of the show and overseeing the volatile cast.

Staff were shocked as he is one of the few senior staff who can actively work with the co-hosts and they respect his point of view.

View to a kill: Things have gotten so tumultuous at The View the co-executive producer of the show is leaving

She's back: No sooner did Rosie Perez return to the set  than she made a major gaffe on air when she blamed a recent Lifetime biopic on Whitney Houston for her daughter Bobbi's ongoing medical emergency.

'He just had to throw up his hands,' a show insider told Daily Mail Online. 'There was only so much he could do. The Rosies are out of control.' 

Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez have had their share of squabbles and tantrums over the months as ratings for the show continues to plummet.The View is down 9 percent among its target audience of women ages 25 to 54 and for the first time the CBS's show The Talk outdid the veteran broadcast in the ratings.

Ad revenue for the show is down a whopping 29 percent according to The Hollywood Reporter. 

The drastic makeover of the show did nothing to bring back viewers, says insiders. And executives are looking closely at the co-hosts to make changes.

As Daily Mail Online reported exclusively last month, Perez was quietly fired from the show while Perez was busy rehearsing for her role in Larry David's new play Fish in the Dark. 

But the network did a speedy about-face after getting backlash not just from the public, but also co-host Rosie O'Donnell, who threw a hissy fit and went on air to deny the that Perez was a goner.

'What the BLEEP,' Rosie said as she was cut off from uttering what was sure to be the f-word.

But Rosie Perez was indeed let go, several ABC sources have confirmed to Daily Mail Online.

Now, Perez has returned to the show after a source close to ABC executives revealed that the network wanted to avoid 'an Ann Curry situation.' The firing of Ann Curry from Today by NBC executives ultimately reflected poorly on the morning news show.

And no sooner did she return than she made a major gaffe on air when she blamed a recent Lifetime biopic on Whitney Houston for her daughter Bobbi's ongoing medical emergency.

Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, was found unresponsive in a bathtub on Saturday at her Roswell, Georgia home nearly three years to the day after her famous mother died under similar circumstances.

'Just thought about the movie that came out, and this is no disrespect to Angela Bassett because I love Angela Bassett, but this unauthorized biography of her mom must have killed her,' Rosie said during the show's Hot Topics segment. 

'That was terrible phrasing,' the 50-year-old co-host quickly said as she gathered her thoughts.

Currently in its eighteenth season, The View, created by retired TV journalist Barbara Walters is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez.

Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show.
