Convention has it that women worry most about their bodies.

Men, however, are just as concerned, suffering the same lack of confidence about their shape – be it a tomato, brick, snowman or nacho.

Hundreds were asked to give details of their figures, allowing researchers to identify seven types among British males.

Snowman: James Cordon

Brick: Robbie Williams

Cucumber: Freddie Flintoff

String bean: Bradley Wiggins

Nacho: Tom Daley

Pear: Ricky Gervais

Tomato: Eamonn Holmes

PEARA little bit larger around the middle

CUCUMBER  Straight up and down with no extra weight

TOMATO  Slightly chubby all over

BRICK  Broad all over

NACHO  Broad shoulders and slim waistline

STRING BEAN  Very skinny and lean

SNOWMAN  Rounded around the stomach and chest creating a figure of eight like shape

Olympic swimmer Tom Daley's toned 
torso shows off the triangular 'nacho', with his broad shoulders and 
slim waist. Although the look is popular with women, only 5 per cent of 
men thought they lived up to this muscular ideal.

The biggest group – 49 per cent – 
admitted being a 'pear' like comedian Michael McIntyre, carrying a 
little extra round their middle.

The most coveted shape was a 'cucumber', the lean figure sported by former England cricket captain Andrew Flintoff.

Although 46 per cent wanted this, only 15 per cent managed it.

The 'brick' or generally broad all 
over figure similar to pop star Robbie Williams applied to 9 per cent of
 the 1,500 men quizzed by menswear retailer Jacamo.

On the chubby side 
were the one in ten who confessed to being a 'tomato' like television 
presenter Eamonn Holmes. 

Professor Brendan Gough, a body image expert at Leeds Metropolitan 
University, said that media portrayals of men (left) are making the 
average man (right) feel insecure about his looks

Fewer than 5 per cent were at the 
extremes of the 'snowman' – with the rounded chest and belly of  Robbie 
Coltrane – or the skinny physique of a 'string bean' like cycling 
champion Bradley Wiggins.

Few of the men surveyed were happy 
with their shape, with almost half admitting they needed to lose weight.
 In fact, almost three-quarters hated their body, proving that it is not
 just women who feel self-conscious about their looks.

Professor Brendan Gough, a 
psychologist at Leeds Metropolitan University, said modern men care much
 more about their appearance than previous generations.

'We live in a world where appearance 
is very important for guys – in work, relationships and well-being,' he 
added. 'Few live up to the  models on magazine covers, but more are 
moisturising, tanning and even wearing make-up. When men look good, they
 feel good.'

The survey found that men felt at 
their physical best aged 28. But, as they aged, they lost confidence and
 some even suffered depression about the way they looked.

Many felt pressure from magazines to 
look good but most admitted poor diets and lack of exercise stopped them
 having a better body.

According to the poll, Prince Harry, 28, probably feels quite confident about his looks

The age at which men feel most confident about their body peaks at 28, according to the same study.

Around 40 per cent admit that at this age they have the perfect shape for their age.

One in three men said they feel they can wear what they want 
at that age, while 41 per cent think they have the perfect weight for 
their size.

Professor Gough said: 
'Men are changing and so is masculinity. In our younger years, we are 
still struggling to find our identity and who we are.

'But when we get into our late twenties and reach 28 we become more comfortable with our bodies and assured about ourselves.

'At that age people are typically starting to get married, have children and establish themselves in their career.

'They become more comfortable in their body and it is the perfect age where you can still get away with eating less sensibility.

'When we get into our 30s our metabolism decreases and start to put on weight.

The last opportunity where we can get away with eating more and still feel good about our body is around 28.
