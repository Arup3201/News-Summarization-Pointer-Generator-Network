A Mercedes that has been abandoned in a multi-storey car park for three years has racked up thousands of pounds in parking charges. 

The owner of the car could be asked to foot a bill of £14,235 after leaving the vehicle at Broadway Plaza, Birmingham, where parking costs £13-a-day.  

But all attempts to contact the driver, understood someone from Coventry, have failed and police have warned that the car will be towed  if the owner is not found.

Abandoned: The Mercedes S-Class has been left in a multi-storey car park near Birmingham city centre

Questions: The doors were discovered to be unlocked, and the vehicle manual was found inside the car

 Missing: The owner of the car, left at Broadway Plaza car park, has yet to be traced by police officers

Car park staff discovered that the black Mercedes S-Class, which has a personalised licence plate, is unlocked but damage to the black axle means it cannot be driven away.

Police said they are still looking for the person who owns the car but warned that the council will be able to remove the vehicle if no one comes forward. 

If local authorities do remove the vehicle from the car park, which has 1,400 spaces, the owner will face further charges. 

There are no records of the Mercedes ever being stolen, or involved in any illegal activity.  

The saloon car has gathered a lot of dust and staff at the parking lot have placed a bright orange barrier in front of the bay. 

A spokesman from APCOA, the company that owns the car park said: 'The car in question has been in situ for a couple of years. 

Cordoned off: Car park staff have been forced to place a bright orange barrier in front of the parking bay

Filthy: The black saloon, which has a personalised licence plate, is now covered in a thick layer of dust

Outstanding charges: It costs £13-a-day to park in one of the 1,400 bays in the car park, owned by APCOA

'The reason why the vehicle is effectively cordoned-off is because one of the back wheel axles is loose, and the car is propped up on one side for reasons of safety.

'West Midlands Police were made aware of the vehicle in the event that it may have been stolen. However, police records confirmed otherwise.

'The police recommended APCOA write to Birmingham City Council to request the removal of the abandoned vehicle.' 

He said that the company had requested the removal of the vehicle approximately four months ago but nothing has been done. 

Clean record: There are no reports of the Mercedes ever being stolen, or involved in any illegal activity

Long stay: The owner will face further charges if the car is removed from the car park by local authorities

He added: 'We will follow-up the abandoned vehicle request in the coming days.'

A spokeswoman for the West Midlands Police said that officers will endeavour to find the owner of the abandoned vehicle. But if that is not possible, the local authority will put a notice on the car warning that it will be towed away seven days later.

A spokesman for the Birmingham City Council stated that the car park was not owned by them, and that the car owner could face a bill for having the car removed.
