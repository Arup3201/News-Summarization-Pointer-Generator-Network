The apartment where Jay Z used to store drugs during his dealing days has been put on the market.

The rapper revealed the location of his former 'stashspot' in the lyrics of his hit song 'Empire State Of Mind' and now the apartment at 560 State Street is for sale.

Though he only mentions the building address in the song and not the apartment number, it has been previously reported to be apartment 10C, which is now on the market for $870,000.

Open plan: The kitchen and living room of the duplex apartment are on the first floor

Spacious: The two-floor, two bedroom apartment feels much bigger than it's actual 1,045 square feet

Modern: The amenities have clearly been updated since Jay Z lived in this apartment in 1997

Outdoor section: The building has a large courtyard area that Jay Z visited recently during the filming of a documentary about his life and upbringing

Jay Z reportedly moved into the building in late 1996 or early 1997, according to Zillow.

The interest in the building came after he included the address in the 2009 hit song: 'I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's / Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's / Took it to my stashspot, 560 State St.'

From there, New York Magazine launched an investigation into the building's famous past, and initially reported that he lived in apartment 10B after speaking to long-term residents.

Global Grind later revealed that the Grammy winning-billionaire actually lived in 10C- as told by Jay Z himself.

New reason to visit: Jay Z and Beyonce are regular visitors to the Barclay's Center, which is just one block from his old digs on State Street

After one of his concerts that helped open the Barclay's Center- which is not far from his old home- Jay Z stopped by 560 State Street and looked at 10C for part of a documentary being filmed about his roots.

'He pointed out where he slept, how he had the place set up with music equipment and where he worked on some of his hip hop masterpieces in the late ’90s,' Amit Wehle, who lives in apartment 10B, told Global Grind.

Now that same apartment that Jay Z called home is on sale, with a price that has clearly appreciated over time.

The two-bedroom apartment in Boerum Hill has one and a half bathrooms and an open plan kitchen-living room.

The Sotheby's listing notes how light pours in the six oversized windows.

A duplex apartment with high ceilings, it comes as little surprise that it is described as being loft-like.
