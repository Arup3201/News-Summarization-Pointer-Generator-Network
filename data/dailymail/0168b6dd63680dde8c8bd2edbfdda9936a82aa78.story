It triggered unprecedented rumblings about his future as Prime Minister - but Tony Abbott is today standing by his decision to knight Prince Philip.  

But following public ridicule and dissension in his own ranks, Mr Abbott told reporters in Melbourne that he accepted people were upset with his decision.

'I stand by the decision. I understand why some people don't like it,' he said. 'I respect their right to be critical... and I take it on the chin, I take it on the chin.' 

His defence of the controversial decision on Wednesday immediately followed a meeting with another person honoured on Australia Day - domestic violence victim Rosie Batty, the Australian of the Year.

Meeting with Rosie Batty: Mr Abbott's statement today came after making a landmark announcement that the government would put domestic violence at the top of the agenda at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG)

Outspoken media mogul Rupert Murdoch, Cabinet minister Barnaby Joyce, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, the Northern Territory chief minister and two backbenchers all publicly criticised the 'captain's pick' on Tuesday - along with numerous unnamed colleagues. 

The prime minister - who confirmed he did not consult his own chief of staff Peta Credlin - said there would be 'considerable more consultation around these awards' in the future.

His humility today was a far cry from his defence of the decision earlier this week, where he wrote off online criticism as merely 'electronic graffiti'.

Mr Abbott said Prince Philip had made a 'great contribution' to Australian public life. He pointed to the thousands of Australians and the 1956 Melbourne Olympics as evidence of this. 

Queensland premier Campbell Newman, who is in the fight of his political life on the campaign trail, told reporters he disagreed with the decision and described it as a 'bolt from the blue'.

Nationals deputy leader Barnaby Joyce told ABC Radio: 'I'm always of the strong belief that all awards should be for Australians'.

Murdoch labelled the decision a 'joke and embarassment' in a Twitter post and called for knighthoods to be scrapped in Australia and in the United Kingdom. 

Political commentator Peter Van Onselen tweeted this morning: 'Based on chats with Libs this AM, for the 1st time (& i can't believe i'm saying this) I now don't think PM can make it to the next election.'

Mr Abbott this morning met with another person officially honoured on Australia Day - Australian of the Year Rosie Batty. 

He announced the government would push for a national Domestic Violence Order scheme - meaning orders would apply across state borders. 

Ms Batty was appointed as a founding member to an advisory council for the Council of Australian Governments.

Mr Abbott said COAG will place domestic violence at the top of its agenda for its next meeting. 

'I am determined that this (naming Ms Batty as Australian of the Year) won't simply be a statement,' he said.  

Ms Batty was photographed in discussions with Mr Abbott and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women Michaela Cash, but did not appear at today's press conference.
