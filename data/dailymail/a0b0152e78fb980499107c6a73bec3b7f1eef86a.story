Southampton are signing Serbia international Filip Djuricic on loan from Benfica.

The 22-year-old has been on loan at Bundesliga side Mainz but his representatives are cancelling that deal to push through the move to Southampton.

Ronald Koeman is keen to bolster his attacking options with Shane Long out injured with broken ribs and a punctured lung.

Djuricic, who can play as a forward, midfielder or left winger, played in Holland for Heerenveen before moving to Benfica in 2013 for £4.5m. He signed a five year deal with a release clause set at £32million. Celtic tried to sign him a year ago for £6million.

He will join Southampton until the end of the season and links up with international team-mate Dusan Tadic.

The Saints are currently flying in the Premier League, sitting pretty in third position, behind Chelsea and Manchester City.
