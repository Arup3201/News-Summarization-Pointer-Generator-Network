A Spanish councillor who resigned after her home-made porn video went viral is posing topless to ‘shut up her critics’.

Olvido Hormigos, 42, was forced to leave her position as a Socialist Workers Party electee in central Spain when a clip showing her pleasuring herself on a bed leaked online.

Now the primary school teacher and mother-of-two wants to put it all in the past by appearing in next-to-nothing in a Spanish magazine.

That'll teach em: Former councillor Olvido Hormigos, 42, who was forced to resign following the sex-tape leak, is now hitting back at her critics by taking her clothes off

Gracing the cover in nothing but a pair of see-through knickers and high heels, she told magazine Interviú, she wants to show the world that she can do ‘whatever she wants with her body’.

Ms Hormigos was forced to step down from her seat as councillor in Los Yébenes, Toledo, 80 miles south of Madrid, when the graphic footage she had sent to her footballer boyfriend was leaked on the internet.

The clip quickly spread around the town of 6,500 people before it was posted on YouTube and spread on social networks across Spain in September.

Party representative: Olvido was a Socialist Workers Party councillor in Toledo, central Spain, when the clip she sent to her then-partner, showing her pleasuring herself on a bed, leaked online

Upon her resignation Ms Hormigos branded the leak 'an attack on her privacy,' saying she handed in her notice 'out of respect for her family and to her party, the PSOE,’ she told Spanish newspaper El Mundo.

Now, Ms Hormigos says she wants revenge on her former partner.

‘All I want is that the recipient of the video who I dated for three months and that now walks around the town as usual, pays for it,’ she says in the interview accompanying the racy photos.

‘People would think I am made of ice, but it was horrible, although I had to get on with my life.’

‘Everybody has been saying for months that I was going to do it. Now I can laugh if they make jokes about the video,’ she said.
