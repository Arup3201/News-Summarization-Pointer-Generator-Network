A team of amputee war heroes are in the spotlight this season after their unbeatable softball skills saw them steam ahead of top able-bodied teams.

The Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team is made up of 15 war veterans, all of whom suffered horrific injuries out in Iraq or Afghanistan serving their country.

Each man on the team has lost one or 
more limbs in battle. Some have lost an arms, others feet or legs, 
amputated either above or below the knee. Between them they have over $2
million worth of prosthetics.

Success: The Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team regularly plays and beats able-bodied police, military and fire department teams

Skill: Most team members were high level softball players before joining the military. This player lost his right leg while serving for the US military.

Shortstop Matt Kinsey told Sport 
Illustrated: ‘Whatever part of your body you lost, you're not going to 
grow it back. So we don't really sit around feeling bad about what 
happened to us. We choose to just get on with it.’

Before joining the military, most 
team members played softball at a competitive level. They say they take 
nothing for granted anymore and are thriving off their triumph on the 
softball pitch.

War: Each team member has lost at least one limb in horrific battlefield injuries. This player lost his hand.

Success: The Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team regularly plays and beats able-bodied police, military and fire department teams. This man only has one leg.

Unbeatable: The Warriors beat an FBI team 35-10 in their first game. This man lost both his legs on the battlefield.

The Warriors will play around 75 games 
this year, all across the USA. Last September they played at Nationals 
Park and they will return on April 3.

Games are held against police, fire 
department and military sides and the team have been training at the 
same facilities as the Washington Nationals.

In
their first match in May last year, the Warriors thrashed an FBI team 
35-10, earning themselves the description of ‘flawless’ and paving the 
way for a long line of successful games.

Coach David Van Sleet told Fox News: ‘We
don’t always win. We have a winning record but we don’t always win. But
we have won because they’re living the life, they’ve survived.

Champions: Two players celebrate a victory. The man on the right only has one arm.

Tough: The players have all served and been injured in Iraq or Afghanistan. This man lost his left leg.

Inspirational: The Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team's slogan

'They didn’t know if they would survive, walk, more or less play a sport. But now that they’ve gone through extensive rehabilitation these guys want more and more.’

Amazingly some of the players have remained in the military and continue to serve their country. Others have gone to college or found work.

But for all of them it is the passion of softball that has turned their lives around.

Catcher Brian Urruela said: ‘I went through limb salvage for two years. I still had my leg but I couldn’t really do anything with it.

'So being out here is definitely, I never thought  it would be possible. I never thought having an amputation would make my life better but it has.’
