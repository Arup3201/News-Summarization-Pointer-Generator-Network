Louis van Gaal showed his sense of humour on Thursday as the Manchester United manager invited a round of applause for new signing Radamel Falcao after the Colombian spoke in English during his first press conference as a Red Devil.

The former Monaco striker looked slightly embarrassed as his new boss grabbed his hand after admitting that it took him a full season in Spain before the Dutchman began to speak the native tongue.

Van Gaal said: 'What do you think about his (Falcao's) English? Because I had the same situation in Spain.
