Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer is apparently a Fergie fan boy.

The former Microsoft CEO was spotted breaking it down with some impressive sideline dance moves as the Black Eyed Peas singer performed at the Staples Center Wednesday evening during his team's game against the Los Angeles Lakers.

He screamed, he flailed his arms, and he danced as if no one was watching.

'He danced exactly how I expected him to, but the enthusiasm is amazing' said Clippers player Blake Griffin. 

Head coach Doc Rivers said he had 'no comment' on Ballmer's dance moves, joking; 'Our relationship is too new.' 

He then added; 'It probably distracted the whole team, that's for sure.' 

Forward Matt Barnes may have had the best response however, saying; 'You can't have everything. You can't have money and moves.' 

This is not the first time Ballmer has commanded a room with his high energy behavior either, showing off some near identical moves during a 2006 presentation while still with Microsoft. 

Ballmer made headlines when he purchased the Clippers last August for $2billion in the wake of the Donald Sterling scandal.

And while the sale was one of the most expensive in NBA history, it has so far paid off for Ballmer, with the Clippers currently in second place in their division.

The team also improved their record last night, as after Ballmer's energetic dance performance they went on to defeat the Lakers.
