The percentage of American women currently in the workforce or actively seeking work has dropped to 56.7per cent - the lowest it has been since 1988.

According to new data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor participation rate of women age 16 and over in September was .2per cent lower than the rate in August.

One factor responsible for the change may be that young women these days are staying in college or graduate school longer than they used to.

The rate first began climbing in the 1950s, when women entered the workforce for the first time. It was at its peak in 2000 at 63per cent, and has been steadily declining ever since.

Meanwhile, the rate of male labor participation was 69.1per cent in September, down from 69.2per cent in August.

'Women have begun to depart the labor force in a way that's similar to men,' Mark Hamrick, Washington, D.C. bureau chief for Bankrate.com, told Market Watch.

According to Mitra Toosi, an economist for the Bureau, further education is one of the main reasons for this drop.

She says that with the struggling economy, many young people are staying in school until they see an improvement.

And those who are going into the workforce right after college run the risk of getting laid off during cutbacks. 

'During a recession, the young people are the last to be hired and the first to be fired and facing competition from more senior employees,' she explained.

What's more, women dominate the fields that got hit hardest by the financial crisis; they make up nearly 60per cent of local and state government employees and 70per cent of educators.  

Not only are fewer women entering the workforce, but the data also showed an increase in stay-at-home moms - from 23per cent in 1999 to 29per cent i 2012.

This is likely linked to the fact that childcare is the biggest household expense for many families, with the average annual cost of full-time infant care ranging from $4,863 in Mississippi to $16,430 in Massachusetts.

This may be because women are staying in college longer, they dominate the fields that were hit hardest by recession, and they are choosing to be stay-at-home momes since childcare is a huge household expense
