Moustache immaculately waxed, George Archibald Hewitt looks every inch the Edwardian gentleman ... but he had his stiffly-starched collar felt for using a false cheque.

Then there is bowler-hat-wearing  Ernest Bell, whose catalogue of crime included the theft of a bicycle, pigeons and ‘jellies’.

Theirs are just two of the portraits in a rogues’ gallery from a century ago which, sartorially, puts today’s hoodie-wearing thugs to shame.

The 'mugshot scrapbook' lists George Archibald Hewitt as using a false cheque. The 57-page book from 1909-12 goes on sale at Bonhams in London in March and could fetch more than £1,000

Ernest Bell, convicted of various misdemeanors, including stealing pigeons. His mugshots form part of a scrapbook compiled by Detective Inspector Robert Mather of the Manchester Police over 100 years ago

A police description of Ernest Bell and a list of his convictions, which shows that he also stole, among other things, bicycles in October 1903

In all, 65 convicts feature in a scrapbook compiled by a Manchester policeman between 1909 and 1912.

Detective Inspector Robert Mather compiled their photographs along with handwritten notes on their physical descriptions, aliases and criminal records and may have used the book to help identify them after arrest.

The 57-page book came to light after being put up for sale at auction by its anonymous owner.

There are 65 convicts recorded and their details include photographs, physical descriptions, aliases, and their crimes and punishments. A 'half-caste' criminal from 'Martinique Cuba' called Jose Dias (left), alias Joseph Dejouru, was sentenced to deportation in 1908

While the old time crooks’ neat 
appearance makes them look a far cry from their modern counterparts, 
their habitual offending was all too often depressingly familiar.

Examples include ‘safebreaker’ Thomas Frieth, whose photograph was taken by Barnsley Borough Police in 1911.

He apparently used the alias  Welson and is described as being 39, 5ft 5½in with dark-brown hair and grey eyes.

His list of convictions includes ‘receiving’, for which he got 18 months, and ‘shopbreaking’, another 18 months.

He then received a total of seven 
years for two counts of housebreaking and five years for shopbreaking. A
Charlie Chaplin lookalike named Michael Riley – alias James Dolan – was
a pickpocket and received a fine of five pounds and prison terms of 11 
then three weeks.

A criminal from ‘Martinique Cuba’ 
called Jose Dias, alias Joseph Dejouru, was sentenced to deportation in 
1908 after an appearance for robbery in front of Bow Street magistrates 
in London.

But he stayed and was later convicted
of stealing a golden watch and dressing case, and being in 
contravention of his expulsion order. Whether he was ever kicked out 
remains a mystery.

Samuel Learson, alias Jackson, was convicted of safe breaking

An account of Samuel Learson in the criminal scrapbook which says he has abscess scars around his neck, which might explain the scarf. Among the items he stole were silver shields

Ernest Bell, aged 20 in 1912, was 
fined £5 for the pigeon theft and received ‘12 strokes’ for stealing the
bicycle. He went on to serve five years in a reformatory for ‘stealing 
jellies’.

Then there are the Learson brothers, Samuel and Ernest. Ernest is grinning widely in his mugshot.

He is described as being 47 years 
old, 5ft 2½in with a light brown moustache and a scar between his 
eyebrows. He received six months for shopbreaking.

Samuel, who also used the name 
Jackson, is said to have ‘abscess scars around neck, scar on cheek and 
eyebrow, three dots on right forearm’.

Harry Roomains, 53, alias Donahue, was convicted in Liverpool, London, Bolton and Manchester of various misdemeanors

His description contains a pre-internet usage of the @ symbol to illustrate 'alias'

He was given six months for stealing 
silver shields, six years for housebreaking then five years for 
shopbreaking. Harry Roomains, 53, must have been a  thorn in the 
police’s side, being convicted of various crimes in Liverpool, London, 
Bolton and Manchester and receiving sentences from three months to six 
years.

Duncan Broady, curator of the 
Manchester Police Museums and Archive, said the official records of Det 
Insp Mather show he joined the force on July 7, 1890 and got his pension
on January 27, 1921.

Born in Stretford, he was a stoker by trade and before joining the police worked for the Manchester Corporation.

The book is expected to fetch £1,000 
when it is sold at Bonhams in London on March 27. Manuscripts expert 
Simon Roberts, from the auction house, said: ‘This looks like something 
the officer compiled for his own use.

‘Although some of the photographs are clearly official police pictures, the rest does not look official.

‘It might have been for his own amusement, but he might also have carried it around with him in order to spot criminals.

‘It measures 7½ inches by 4½ inches so it would have fitted into a large pocket.’

Mr Roberts added: ‘There are collectors who would like to have this and it might appeal to institutions, libraries and archives.’
