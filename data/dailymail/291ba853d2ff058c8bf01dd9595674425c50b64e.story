Shocking details have emerged which suggest one of the two men arrested in counter terrorism raids on Tuesday allegedly planned to kill people at random in the Blue Mountains.

The National Security Committee was told about the alleged attacks as part of a briefing on the men's broader terror plans shortly before they approved the Australian Federal Police's raids in Sydney's west.

It is thought that one of the men had planned to carry out guerrilla warfare in the Blue Mountains region - just outside Sydney - targeting and killing random people in the area's bushland, reports the Daily Telegraph.

It has been alleged a Sydney jihadist had planned to carry out random attacks in the Blue Mountains, NSW

The two men arrested during the terror raids have both been charged and refused bail.

One of the men previously stormed off the set of a television program while wearing an Islamic State symbol.

Sulayman Khalid has been placed behind bars after he was charged with possessing documents listing potential targets for a terrorist attack. 

Khalid, 20, from Regents Park in Sydney's west, was formally refused bail in Parramatta Local Court.

The Marsfield man, who cannot be named, was charged with breaching a Control Order. He was refused bail after a magistrate deemed him an 'unacceptable risk to the community'. 

The arrests followed raids around 1.30pm last Thursday where police seized a large number of documents outlining possible Federal and State government targets, a rifle and two shotguns. 

Deputy NSW Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said the men were arrested as part of an ongoing investigation into an apparent ring of 15 to 20 people.

She said 11 people have been charged so far under the counter-terrorism operation, known by the codename Appleby.  

The same investigation conducted the largest raids in the nation's history on September 18, which involved more than 800 NSW and Federal Police.   

AFP Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan told reporters the men shared the 'ideology' of the Islamic State terror group.

'It is a group of people here in Sydney who we've been actively monitoring for a long time,' he said. 'Certainly their ideology is linked to [Islamic State].' 

Adam Houda, Khalid's lawyer, told Daily Mail Australia his client has been charged with a very serious offence. 

'But I want to remind you that the authorities have got it wrong in the past many times,' Mr Houda said. 

'I ask that the court process be respected and for this matter to be determined on the evidence and not by politicians and the media.' 

A 21-year-old man was arrested for breaching a Control Order

The largest terror raids in the nation's history were conducted earlier this year

Under the name Abu Bakr, Khalid appeared on the SBS program Insight earlier this year for a forum about the Federal government's cancellation of terror suspect's passports. The part-time labourer had his passport suspended last December. 

He stormed off the set after facing a grilling over his support for the Islamic State terror group.

In a separate hearing, prosecutors alleged today that the Marsfield man breached the conditions of his control order by using a public telephone and a mobile phone which did not belong to him in the space of an hour on Monday evening. 

His lawyer, Arjun Chhabra, told the court the mobile belonged to his mother and said his age should be taken into consideration. 

Today's arrests follow an extraordinary pre-Christmas message from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, where he warned a terrorist attack remains 'likely'. 

'The briefing from the security agencies today indicated there has been a heightened level of terrorist chatter in the aftermath of the Martin Place siege,' he said. 

He said security agencies would be 'highly visible' as the nation moves into the festive season.

On December 15, crazed gunman Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Martin Place cafe. 

Barrister Katrina Dawson, hospitality worker Tori Johnson and Monis were killed on Tuesday morning as the siege came to a bloody end.
