Managerless Manchester United have agreed a deal with FK Vojvodina to sign Serbia youth goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic.

The 17-year-old will stay with the Serbian side next season before moving to Old Trafford to provide competition for first choice number one David de Gea.

The Spaniard has undoubtedly been United's standout player this season, winning both the Players' Player of the Year and the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year awards at the end of season awards.

Signed: Man Utd have acquired 17-year-old Serbian goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic

Milinkovic is a youth international, making six appearances for Serbia Under-17s in the recent UEFA Championship qualifying.

His transfer is the first by the 20-times English champions since they sacked manager David Moyes, who replaced legendary predecessor Alex Ferguson, in April after a disappointing first campaign.

Dutch coach Louis van Gaal is widely expected to be announced as the new head coach of United, who finished seventh in the league last term.
