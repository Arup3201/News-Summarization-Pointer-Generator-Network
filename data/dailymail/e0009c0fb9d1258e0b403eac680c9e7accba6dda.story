A bride-to-be from Hull who last year wouldn’t have been be found within a mile of a gym, is now a self confessed exercise addict who has found so much fulfillment from her training that she’s asked her personal trainer to be a witness at her wedding.

Gillian Shaw, 32, has lost over four stone since she began first took her first tentative steps into exercising last April with personal trainer, Tom Cowen, with the aim of trimming down for her wedding this August.

Weighing in at 15st, Gillian was a dress size 18-20, and had warnings from her doctor she was at risk of becoming diabetic.

Gillian's total lack of exercise and unhealthy diet of fast food saw her weight rise to 15st and she was warned she good develop diabetes

Now, after just over a year, Gillian  weighs 10st 8lb and has reached her target dress size 8-10

'Before starting the gym I was lazy from overeating and lack of exercise. Everyday was a struggle, I'd avoid activities and joining in things from the fear getting out of breath and embarrassment.

'Being the size I was walking running and even stairs where a struggle.

'Joining a gym was the last thing on my mind out of fear and anxiety from being the size I was and getting looked at.'

Gillian joined the gym in January but couldn’t turn down the crisps, cakes and takeaways, and her weight continued to rise.

Three months later Gillian decided enough was enough and, determined to fit into her dream size 8 wedding dress, she began training sessions with personal trainer Tom, twice a week and took on a total diet overhaul.

Now, after just over a year Gillian weighs 10st 8lb and has reached her target dress size 8-10.

Gillian and Tom got on so well during training sessions that they’ve become close friends and Gillian truly values how Tom has helped her to change her attitude towards food.

Fear and embarrassment over her size meant Gillian used to be scared of going to the gym

With Tom 
guiding her at every step of her weight loss in preparation for her big 
day, Gillian felt it was only right to ask him to be witness at her 
wedding.

Gillian said: 'I obviously needed the guidance that Tom gave me, when I was going to the gym by myself I wasn’t shifting any weight at all.

'I couldn’t have done it without him. Tom is such a lovely guy, he really pushes me but most importantly he’s believed in me.

Trainer Tom has become so close to Gillian during her transformation he is going to be a witness at her wedding

'I have him to thank for the size I’ll be on my wedding day, which is why I want him there as a witness.”

Tom is so proud of Gillian’s achievements that he recently booked her in for a surprise full make-over so Gillian could really see how much she’s changed in the past year.

'I’m immensely proud of Gill, and I wanted to do something for her to give her a little reward for her determination. I got in contact with a local beauty salon to ask if they could glam her up so everyone could see how amazing she really looks.

'The transformation is amazing and the smile says it all. I’m honoured to have a part in it.'

'I set Gillian on a strict healthy eating plan, getting rid of any starchy carbs and sugars from her diet.

'Gillian used to skip meals which effectively ruined her metabolism, so I had her eating little and often to repair the damage. Eating this way gave her more fuel for work outs.'
