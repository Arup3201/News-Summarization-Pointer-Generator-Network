Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes Eden Hazard's below-par showing against Aston Villa was a one off.

Hazard was Chelsea's startling performer last season and is likely to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge, staving off reported interest from Paris St Germain and Real Madrid.

The 23-year-old Belgium playmaker has spoken of his desire to claim the Ballon d'Or and wanted the number 10 shirt at Chelsea, worn by his idol Zinedine Zidane.

Jose Mourinho has dismissed the Belgian's poor performance as a one off

Suggested Hazard was below his best in Saturday's 3-0 defeat of Villa, Mourinho said: 'Yes. (I) agree.

'I don't know what he needs. I know he needs to play more than he did (against Villa).

'He started the season well. Eden played good matches with us.

'I think it's more an isolated not good performance than a period.

'No dramas and (I am) not too much worried about it, but (Saturday) was not his day, was not his performance.'

It is likely Mourinho will give Hazard another chance to return to his high-standard showings against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday in Champions League Group G.

Mourinho also hopes to select Diego Costa for a second match in quick succession in Portugal, but it remains to be seen how the prolific striker recovers, given his fragile hamstrings.
