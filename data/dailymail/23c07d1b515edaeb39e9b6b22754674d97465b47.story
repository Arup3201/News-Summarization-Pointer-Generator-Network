Six months on, a year long deep sea search for the Malaysian airlines plane, missing in the Indian Ocean, will commence in September. 

The southern part of the search zone will be prioritised looking for MH370 and will see towed vehicles equipped with sonar
and video cameras, dragged along the sea floor, off the coast of Perth. 

In Canberra, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss met with his Malaysian and Chinese counterparts and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered.

Mr Truss said analysis of the airline's failed satellite phone call attempt to Flight MH370 suggests the plane might have turned south earlier than previously expected. 

'A failed satellite telephone conversation was attempted between Malaysia Airlines on the ground and the aircraft, and
that has suggested to us that the aircraft may have turned south a little earlier than we had previously expected,'
Buzzfeed reported Mr Truss saying.

The 1.1 million square kilometres search zone remains the same size but authorities have been able to make refinements with satellite data. 

'The (data) expanded our knowledge of the area, indicating depths up to 1500 metres deeper than previously known, and
the identification of two underwater volcanos,' said Mr Truss. 

The expensive $52 million pricetag will be split between Australia and Malaysia. 

'We have so far committed and spent about $15 million (AUD) and we are also going to match the Australians in the
tender cost for this search for MH370. We need to find the plane, we need to find the black box to come to a conclusion,'
said Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai.

Buzzfeed reported that Australia had budgeted up to $90 million over the next two years to find the plane but there's question over whether
it would be extended over that period. 

'Malaysia’s pledge continued and unwavering support in response to the unprecedented nature and scale of this event  through our financial commitment, technical expertise, equipment, and stamina in our search for answers,' said Mr Truss. 

But It's a race against time.

More than 200 people have been employed by Dutch surveying group Fugro to get the job done as quickly as possible.

They have a one-year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, before they will be forced to move on by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).

Fugro must follow the lead provided by the ATSB. Forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months.

‘We know the time frame we have is about a year, after that we’ll be working in a new box as provided by the ATSB – they’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it (the plane wreckage) may be further south or north, they can order us to move at any time,' said Fugro Managing Director, Steve Duffield.

‘There’s certainly no time to waste.'

‘We’ve got one year to search inside our designated box, if you like, before moving on.'

The images (below) of the search process which have been provided to Daily Mail Australia by Fugro, give a sense of what the Dutch team is up against.

The Fugro, which is 65 metres long, is highlighted by the small circle, dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern Indian Ocean. It has just returned to the area after a crew change.

In a setback for the operation, Mr Duffield said the sister ship, Furgo Discovery, has had to be diverted via West Africa and away from the Suez Canal 'because we were worried about pirates, even though we went through the process of hardening the boat'. That included placing barbed wire right about Discovery to try and prevent any potential hijacking.

It should arrive in mid-September, about 10 days later than expected.

'I’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success,' Mr Duffield said.

Surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea-bed ahead of sensors being sent down. In some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down.

Using its advanced survey vessel, the Fugro Equator, fitted with state-of-the art multibeam echosounder equipment, Fugro is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area. The seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off Western Australia.

Fugro will spend more than $52 million in the next year in the search for MH370. 200 personnel will work on the project and are 'finding equipment from factories all around the world'

Mapping work continues in the area designated by the ATSB, as Fugro try to make the most of every possible minute.

‘They (the ATSB) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate,’ he said.

That ‘box’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean, an area approximately the size of Tasmania, 1600 kilometres off the West Australian coast.

‘We are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches,’ Mr Duffield said.

Optimistically, he added that ‘we expect to see a debris field’.

‘We are also expecting, in a worst-case scenario, that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object.

‘We’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn, so to speak. That's when we tow our sensors along the bottom.

'That's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the Blue Fins were unsuccessful - it's very deep water we're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places.

‘But our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date, is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea-bed.

‘I’m not really sure how this will search will end up, it’s a massive area about the size of Tasmania and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task.’

The search conducted by the Dutch firm Fugro will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre stretch of the Indian Ocean off the WA coast

MH370 went missing on March 8 on the way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, including six 
Australians and 153 Chinese nationals.

Initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following its disappearance indicated it most likely crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,500km south-west of Perth.

But despite an international search effort led by Australia and operated out of the Pearce Air Force base in Perth, no debris from the plane has been found.

Troubled carrier Malaysia Airlines is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17

The first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas, conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships, which concluded on April 28.

An acoustic search, accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted, also without success. The ocean floor search was completed on May 28.

As part of a major restructure, the Malaysian Government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private. Significant job losses are expected.

The overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of MH370 and MH17.

Mr Truss and Mr Lai also discussed ongoing recovery efforts for MH17 - the Malaysia Airlines jet downed by a missile 
strike over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing 298 people, including 38 Australians.
