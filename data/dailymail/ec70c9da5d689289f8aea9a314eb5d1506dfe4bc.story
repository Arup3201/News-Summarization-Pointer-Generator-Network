If you've ever dreamt of racing down the rapids and floating through the Grand Canyon, Google has made it a lot easier.

The firm undertook one of its riskiest missions yet to capture 286 miles of the river, including the most dangerous rapids.

To capture them, it mounted its multi-lens Street View camera on a dinghy before floating it down the river.

A team of rafters and runners combined to capture the images, taking the camera on the water and hikes close to the river.

Three staff from American Rivers joined Google Maps on an eight-day float through the Grand Canyon in August 2013 to capture the river imagery.

The Street View camera, on a special mount built for the raft, captured a full 360-degree photo sphere every few seconds.

The team captured 286 miles of the river, from Lee’s Ferry to Pearce Ferry.

Members of the team also wore the Street View Trekker camera to capture five popular side hikes, including the trail to the Nankoweap Granaries with a dramatic view overlooking the river.

'For 6 million years, the Colorado River has flowed through the heart of the desert southwest, its waters slowly carving out a canyon so vast it can be seen from space—yet so remote it didn’t appear on early maps of the region,' said Chris Williams, Senior Vice President of Conservation at American Rivers, who worked with Google on the project.

'It wasn’t until 1869, when John Wesley Powell led a small exploration party on a rafting trip, that the natural wonders of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon came fully into view.

'Now with Google Street View, you can ride the whitewater rapids, cruise the sleepy river bends, and discover the side canyons that make the Colorado River a treasured resource. '

'Supported by the outfitter Arizona River Runners, three of us from American Rivers joined Google Maps on an eight-day float through the Grand Canyon in August 2013 to capture the river imagery.

'This allows users to “join the raft” and explore 286 miles of the river, from Lee’s Ferry to Pearce Ferry. Members of the team (and American Rivers!) also wore the Street View Trekker camera to capture five popular side hikes, including the trail to the Nankoweap Granaries with a dramatic view overlooking the river.'

The addition is the first time Google Maps has used the Street View technology on a major whitewater river.

The raft braved the rapids without capsizing

The project brings renewed attention to the wonder and beauty of the Grand Canyon, as well as the challenges facing the Colorado River’s health. 

American Rivers named the Colorado River America’s Most Endangered River in 2013 because of the threat of outdated water management, over-allocation and persistent drought.

'Thirty-six million people from Denver to Los Angeles drink Colorado River water,' said Williams.

'The river irrigates nearly four million acres of land, which grows 15 percent of the nation’s crops.

'Over-allocation and drought have placed significant stress on water supplies and river health, and the basin is facing another drought this summer.

'Lower river flows threaten endangered fish and wildlife, along with the $26 billion dollar recreation economy that relies on the Colorado River.'

In conjunction with this launch, American Rivers is calling on President Obama and Congress to support federal programs that assist cities and farms in getting smarter about managing their water supplies.
