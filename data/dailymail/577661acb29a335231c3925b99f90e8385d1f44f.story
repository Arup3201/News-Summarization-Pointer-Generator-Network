The magnificent summer home of Egyptologist Lord Carnarvon, with 40 rooms, 31,000 square metres of parkland and magnificent views of the Italian Riviera, is going up for sale.

However, with an asking price of 34 million euros, potential buyers of Villa Altachiara will need deep pockets.

They will also need to be fairly fearless, because it's said to be jinxed by the Curse of Tutankhamun, after Lord Carnarvon uncovered the pharaoh's tomb.

The magnificent summer home of Egyptologist Lord Carnarvon, with 40 rooms, 31,000 square metres of parkland and magnificent views of the Italian Riviera, is going up for sale - but it's said to be jinxed

The 140-year-old villa, which goes under the hammer in November in Genoa, was eventually sold by the Carnarvons to the Agusta family of helicopter magnates

The imposing 19th century mansion built on a clifftop overlooking the chic seaside town of Portofino, was built by the fourth Lord Carnarvon, Henry, as his summer retreat.

His main home was Highclere Castle, famed for being used as the location of Downton Abbey. 

'Alta Chiara ' is Italian translation of the name of 'Highclere,'

His son, the fifth Lord Carnarvon, George, who inherited the villa, had been left with a permanent limp and badly injured lungs after an accident in his racing car.

Expensive: The villa has an asking price of 34 million euros

Advised by doctors to recover in a warm climate he took up the-then fashionable Egyptology. 

Working with famed English archaeologist Howard Carter, the two men made the extraordinary discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, the richest burial site ever found.

But soon after discovering the tomb of the boy pharoah in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, Lord Carnavon died from an infected mosquito bite in Cairo's Savoy Continental Hotel.

This unexpected death, so soon after the tomb had been opened, gave way to the myth that he was cursed by the young pharaoh for disturbing his eternal peace.

The legend was perpetuated when his nephew died months later, after falling down a flight of steps at the villa.

The 140-year-old villa, which goes under the hammer in November in Genoa, was eventually sold by the Carnarvons to the Agusta family of helicopter magnates.

It features a pool, a helicopter pad and 30 rooms. 

Then in 2001 another unexplained death followed when former Gucci model and heiress Countess Francesca Agusta, disappeared from the clip-top villa.

According to witnesses, she flew into a tranquilizer- and whisky-fuelled rage and stormed out in bathrobe and slippers with the words 'I'm going for a swim'.

Three weeks later, her body washed up near Saint-Tropez.

Although the coroner ruled her death was accidental, family suspected it was murder while others claimed it was suicide.

Boy king: Tutankhamen, who ruled Egypt between 1333 and 1323
