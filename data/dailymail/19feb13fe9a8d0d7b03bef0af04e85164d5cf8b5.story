Homecoming: Alexandra Greenwall, 10, returned to her Rio Rancho home on Saturday night

'I think that there was a collective sigh of relief in the City of Rio Rancho amongst everybody involved,' Rio Rancho Police Lt. Paul Rogers said, as reported by KQRE.

'Because she just appeared at the home, we don't know if she walked to the home, or if somebody dropped her off,' he also said.

Rio Rancho Police Chief Michael Geier earlier said that multiple agencies, including the FBI, the National Guard, as well as Alburquerque police and state police were involved in the search, ABQJournal.com reported.

Before Alexandra Greenwall was found, Rogers had said she may have left the home she lives in with her mother and stepfather in order to find a former stepfather of hers, according to the website.

The last time her mother Catherine Greenwall saw her daughter was Wednesday evening, when she tucked her into bed, the mother said, KQRE earlier reported.

Alexandra Greenwall seemed to pack her backpack with clothing before she left the house, her family had told the affiliate station.

Catherine Greenwall had said her daughter could have left because after some of her stuffed animals were taken away for bad behavior, KQRE reported.

What happened? The girl's mother, Catherine Greenwall, had believed her daughter may have gone off to find her former stepfather 

Speaking out: Alexandra Greenwall's mother Catherine and her most recent stepfather Lyle earlier addressed the media and asked for help
