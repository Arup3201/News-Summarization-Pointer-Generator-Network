This is the heart-stopping moment two British sailors are washed off the side of a yacht as it is capsizes while being buffeted by 115mph winds. 

Sarah Usher and Liz Richards are seen desperately trying to grab hold of the 70ft boat as they are swept overboard when the freak weather conditions hit.

Their 70ft yacht was blown onto one side as the wind built then smashed almost 180 degrees onto the other as the tornado struck.

The 70ft racing yacht is sailing in the Pacific Ocean north of Papua New Guinea in January when it capsizes 

In seconds, the boat is thrown sideways by the 115mph winds, washing two of the crew overboard 

The vessel remains on its side for more than 60 seconds as the tornado passes over the yacht

Winds of more than 115mph pinned the capsized yacht down for around 60 seconds.

Dramatic footage of the ordeal shows the boat’s crew dragging the pair out of the water and back on board the boat as the winds ease.

The tornado can then be seen disappearing into the distance as the boat returns to upright. 

Ms Usher, 34, from Hull, East Yorkshire, and Ms Richards, 65, from Dartmouth, Devon, were both wearing life jackets at the time and were shaken but uninjured in the ordeal.

They were part of an 18-strong crew on the Great Britain yacht competing in the Clipper Round the World Race, a 40,000-mile yacht race for amateur sailors.

The footage, filmed from a camera fixed to the yacht’s mast, was taken in the Pacific Ocean just north of Papua New Guinea in January as the fleet raced from Brisbane to Singapore.

It was released by race organisers as the fleet of 12 boats begins the final leg of the race from Den Helder in the Netherlands to the finish in London today. 

It comes just months after London sailor Andrew Taylor, 46, was swept overboard a rival yacht in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Andrew was rescued after spending 90 minutes in the water.

Like many of the competitors, Ms Usher, who manages sports events, had never sailed before signing up to to the race.

She joined the crew for the legs from Sydney to Hobart in Australia then from Brisbane to Singapore.

She said: 'We had been through a lot of squalls in the race and so we had a routine and we knew what we were doing.

'We could see another squall was coming and so another team mate and I went up to the mast to help reduce our sails.

'I couldn’t reach the mast from where I was so unclipped my safety line to clip it onto the mast and in that split second the waterspout hit.

'I remember being hit by a rush of water. I lost my balance and the force of the water just took me over the side.

As the winds begin to subside, the boat rights itself allowing the crew to safely rescue the two women

She said: 'I was shouting at my crew ‘I’m not clipped on, I’m not clipped on!’ My heart was in my mouth - it was pretty frightening.

'As the waterspout passed the boat started to right itself and I scrabbled around trying to grab hold of anything I could.

'Liz was also in the water next to me. Our team mates were able to grab us and pull us back onboard.

'It all happened so quickly and yet it felt like it was going on forever.

'The tornado passed and we were told to go down into the cabin. I was shaken but the support of the crew was amazing.

'After a while I was able to rejoin my watch on deck and I slowly got back into doing my jobs around the boat.

'It hasn’t put me off sailing but it has given me a new respect for the sea.'

Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, founder and chairman of the race, praised the crew of the yacht for their response to the drama.

He said: 'What this video shows is how well trained the crews are.

'They’re racing along on a 70ft boat and the next thing they know they are hit by a tornado and the boat is knocked onto its side.

'The forces inside these funnels wind are huge but no-one was hurt, everyone knew exactly what to do.

'The boat rights itself as soon as the tornado passes and the crew deal with the situation very quickly and professionally.

'It is incredibly rare to be hit by a tornado but our crews spend months being trained for every possibility.'

The Clipper Round the World Race teams are expected to arrive at Tower Bridge on Saturday.

More than 670 amateur sailors from all over the world have taken part in this year’s race, the ninth edition of the event, which started in Tower Bridge in September last year.

The youngest sailor was 18 and the oldest was 74.
