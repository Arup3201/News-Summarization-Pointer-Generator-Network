As many as half a million men are thought to have ditched the razor this month to grow a moustache in aid of the Movember appeal.

Now moustache mania has taken to the skies after airlines painted them beneath the noses of their jets to help raise awareness of prostate and testicular cancer.

British Airways, Virgin, Qantas and WestJet planes are all sporting the quirky additions - ranging from trim 'connoisseur' styles to a full-blown handlebar moustache and beard.

Last year male employees of British Airways raised Â£80,000 for the Prostate Cancer charity by sprouting moustaches for Movember.

This time around the airline has gone one step further by adding freshly-painted facial fuzz to its fleet of aircraft.

Head of health services Liz Wilkinson said: 'We're always delighted to support Movember, it's a charity that's very dear to our hearts here at British Airways, especially as our former CEO Lord Marshall suffered from the disease.'

The firm considered various styles for its planes - including the pencil, the handlebar, the horseshoe and the trucker - before finally settling on the neat connoisseur moustache.
