In the light of recent news that a British firm had created a 230 calorie Full English breakfast that you can drink, MailOnline felt duty bound to try it out.

Our verdict? It may be low fat, low cal and have what the firm describe as a 'powerful, distinctive and appealing' taste... but it looks like vomit.

Yes. If you were thinking of stocking up on these as a post-Christmas party hangover cure, think again. It's the sort of drink that could prompt a full-scale relapse if you're feeling a bit delicate.

Trial run: The firm's flavour kitchen has produced a batch of the liquid fry up drink to gauge reaction and understand whether it will be a commercial proposition

Proof is in the pudding: Bosses at Fuel admitted that whether people like the taste of the fry up drink very much depends on personal taste - and we would agree

Duty called though, so I gave the drink a sniff. Thankfully, it has barely any aroma, and the faint whiff it does have is not at all unpleasant. Think of the smell of a piece of chewed up toast - kind of sweet, and a bit carby.

But as the pale orange liquid rippled out of the mouth of the container into the cup, I watched in horror as foul-looking bobbly bits bumped and flowed over the carton's rim. My stomach convulsed with every one.

It reminded me of the time my twin sister got car sick after eating a bag of Hula Hoops and the resulting rubbery clusters pinged and bounced around the back seat.

That all-too-vivid memory coupled with the sensation of the vomity bobbles as they clung to my lips on the way in was enough to set off my sensitive gag reflex, which had sprung to attention as soon as I opened the carton.

Tasty treat: The liquid fry up is being developed as the perfect and fast breakfast on the go for the chisel-jawed action man. Right, reality bites as the drink is poured into a cup for tasting

The drink, which did taste essentially like a fry-up milkshake, had no chance. Its cloying, meaty sweetness clung to the back of my tongue. It was one of the most unwelcome things I have ever had in my mouth, and I have eaten everything from lamb's testicles and tongue to mealworms and grasshoppers.

Let's be fair though. I am neither the target audience nor the most ideal guinea pig. The liquid fry-up and I were never destined to be culinary soulmates. I like poached eggs with grilled vine tomatoes, a few slices of avocado and sourdough toast for my breakfast.

I would never eat or drink anything that contained mystery ingredients, anything with a chemical compound I couldn't pronounce (unless it was a Haribo Tangfastic), or anything with an even remotely 'meal replacement' vibe.

So what did one of my, ahem, less fussy colleagues, James - dubbed Human Dustbin by peers - make of the liquid fry-up?

For starters, despite saying it looked 'f****** disgusting', he downed the whole cup. Already way ahead of me.

But although he has got a stomach of iron and seemed not to flinch at the bobbly bits, in a rare moment of self-control, he refused to go back for more.

'It’s not often that I’d turn down the offer of a full English breakfast – but this is probably one of those times,' he said afterwards.

'With the consistency and appeal of a soggy bowl of cornflakes, the drink is sweet, filling and good for those on a diet – because one mouthful is plenty.'

I asked him if it turned his stomach. 'No, but then not a lot does,' he said. High praise there then... but, ever eager to give products a fair trial, I sought out another victim sorry, I mean guinea pig, to test the fry-up.

Victim #2, Karl, was less diplomatic. If that's possible. 'It tastes like sweet, milky sick,' he said (a man after my own heart).

'It looks like has tiny bits of satsuma floating in the top, and has a nasty oily sheen to boot. Ugh.'

A third victim admitted that it wasn't the best thing they'd ever drunk, but it 'definitely tasted of bacon and eggs', 'wasn't that bad' and they would 'definitely down it to get through to lunch'. A win!

With that though, the rest of the liquid fry-up had to go the way of the bin. Maybe the chisel-jawed action men it's targeted at will like it better than we did.

Sorry chaps!

Tucking into a full English breakfast
 is a favourite for millions... but now a British firm claims to have 
captured all the flavours in a drink, with a third of the calories.

In
 the mix are the tastes of two rashers of streaky bacon, one grilled 
Cumberland sausage, a poached egg, two fried tomatoes, baked beans, 
mushrooms, brown toast, salt, pepper and brown sauce.

Fuel,
 behind more recognisable breakfast drink flavours such as chocolate and
 latte, insists the ingredients have been distilled rather than pulped 
into a runny gloop.

As a 
result, each 330ml carton has about 6g of fat and 230 calories. Even a 
relatively modest fry-up would clock up 37g of fat with 618 calories.

Fuel
 co-founder Barney Mauleverer said: ‘It will not be for everyone, but 
for people who do like the flavour notes of a fry-up, I think it’s 
great. If it gets a positive reaction, then it will go into production.’

The
 company already has Fuel liquid breakfast cartons on the shelves of the
 likes of Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, which come in less alarming 
chocolate, strawberry or caramel latte flavours.

Just
 as busy Britons have given up on eating breakfast at the kitchen table 
in favour of cereal bars munched on the daily commute, so the new drinks
 could take the place of bacon and eggs.

Mr Mauleverer said his team have 
tested more than 500 fry up combinations to develop what they believe is
 a powerful,  distinctive and appealing taste.

‘We have taken about six months, testing hundreds of recipe combinations to get to this point,’ he said.

Breakfast time: Scientists have extracted infusions of flavours from a real fry up and added them to a milk base

Taste test: 'Frygella' gives the breakfast potion a try

‘What
 we have done is extract infusions of flavours from a real fry up, 
rather than blending up bacon and sausages which turns in to a bit of a 
lumpy mush.

‘The flavours have been mixed with a 
milk base, where we have added protein, fibre and vitamins. It is a bit 
like the clever techniques used by Heston Blumenthal to make his ice 
cream.’

At the moment, the 
firm’s flavour kitchen has produced a batch of the liquid fry up drink 
to gauge reaction and understand whether it will be a commercial 
proposition.

‘If people like it, we will take it on to the next level,’ he said. ‘The drink has a good level of protein, but we are not selling this as a muscle-building product.'

Rather the idea is that it is sufficiently tasty and filling that it will carry someone through until lunch.

He
 added: ‘We have managed to keep it below one per cent fat and we think it 
will be around 200-230 calories, which is a reasonable level for what is
 a meal replacement product.’

The company has carried out market research to identify a target market.

Domestic Goddess: The company has created a spoof Youtube video featuring a character called 'Frygella' to promote the idea

‘There
 is a big group of breakfast skippers between the ages of 17 and 35. 
They tend to be more male than female. People who roll out of bed, cycle
 into work and maybe grab a coffee and have something at their desk,’ he
 said.

‘You could almost 
call them the iPhone brigade who don’t take breakfast seriously. It is 
trying to help them with different breakfast formats that are 
convenient, portable and re-sealable.

At the same time, they get quite a
 good dose of nutrients without even thinking about it.’

The company has created a spoof YouTube video featuring a character called ‘Frygella’ to promote the idea.

Fuel
 was founded by Mr Mauleverer and friend Alex Matheson 18 months ago and
 began selling the breakfast drinks in April this year. The drinks sell 
for £1.49 and are free of VAT because they are sold as a food, rather 
than a sports nutrition product.

Mr
 Mauleverer is something of an extreme sports enthusiast, while the 39 
year-old’s exploits include a two week 220-mile trek through the Amazon 
jungle. Mr Matheson is a former tank commander in the British army.
