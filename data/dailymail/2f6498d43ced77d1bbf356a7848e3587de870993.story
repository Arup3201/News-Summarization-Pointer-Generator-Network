Popping to the pub for a pint is a characteristically British activity and partly why the nation’s favourite tipple has always been beer.

But according to new research, this is no longer the case.

We are in fact now a nation of wine-drinkers – with more people heading to the pub for a glass than ever before, a poll suggests.

It found 60 per cent of UK adults - including the majority in each age group and across all regions of the UK – are choosing it over other alcoholic drinks.

Wine has toppled the classic pint and is now the nations favourite drink, according to new research

Experts say the growth in popularity of wine in the UK – traditionally not a wine-drinking nation - is due in part to more education on the different types available.

This is due to increasing international travel to southern Europe and other traditional wine-drinking countries, as well as more information on television and in the media.

Despite often being associated with older generations and higher social classes – given in part to its costliness – the poll by Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) found this was no longer the case.

In fact, wine is now the preferred drink for 57 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.

WSTA Chief Executive Miles Beale said last night: ‘Our polling shows that regardless of the stereotypes, wine is now the nation’s favourite drink and is enjoyed by a majority of adults across all ages, regions and social classes.

‘With alcohol consumption falling by around a fifth in the past decade, consumers now are drinking less but better wines.

‘This change is greatly due to the opening up of inexpensive, good quality wines. We have seen growth in new world wines, with produce from places such as Chile, New Zealand and Australia readily available for UK consumers. There has also been an encouraging growth in high quality English wines.’

Increased international travel to southern Europe and other traditional wine-drinking countries is believed to be behind the change

By comparison, according to figures released by the British Beer & Pub Association’s (BBPA) quarterly ‘Beer Barometer’, last year pubs sold 2million fewer pints of beer than ten years earlier.

The UK wine industry, which includes a growing number of vineyards, is worth £17.3bn in economic activity to the British economy, supports nearly 270,000 jobs and contributes £8.6bn to the public finances annually.

However, tax paid on the wine sold in the UK is currently at a record high.

UK consumers currently pay nearly 60 per cent tax on an average priced bottle of wine.

When asked about current levels of alcohol tax, 64 per cent of the 4,049 adults interviewed in the poll said they think that alcohol duty is too high.

The move towards wine drinking by British consumers is reflected in the importance now placed on the UK wine market worldwide, with the UK now the sixth largest market globally.

UK drinkers are also drinking more responsibly. HMRC data shows that total alcohol consumption per head of the UK population fell by 18.4 per cent between 2004 and 2013, from 9.5 litres of pure alcohol per person to 7.7.

Leading wine expert Matthew Jukes said: ‘This polling finally dispels the myth that wine is elitist.’
