Scam: Cyclist Jack Cartwright, 24, tricked a driver into thinking she had injured his ankle, before his accomplice drove off in her car

A retired nurse was tricked into thinking she had hit a cyclist by thieves who then drove off in her £15,000 Volkswagen when she got out to help.

Cyclist Jack Cartwright, 24, pretended 
that he had injured his ankle, prompting the driver, Anne Boydell, to jump out of her 
VW Tiguan 4x4 in Ashton, Greater Manchester, to help him.

He told her that his ankle was swelling, but when the retired nurse asked him to show her his other ankle so she could compare them she noticed that he was wearing an electronic tag and guessed it was a scam.

Another man suddenly appeared, jumped into her vehicle and drove off, as Cartwright leapt onto his bike and followed him, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

Mrs Boydell, from Wigan, was left 
stranded without her phone or handbag, which had been in the car and 
contained a large sum of cash and her house keys.

Police recovered Cartwright’s socks at the scene but before they could be swabbed for DNA, he was identified from CCTV footage and arrested on two weeks later.

Cartwright, from St Helens, Merseyside later admitted to theft.

His accomplice, who is known to police, has not yet been tracked down and the vehicle, worth £15,000 is also still missing.

It was spotted several days after the incident with false registration plates and being driven by the other man, Peter Barr, prosecuting, told the court.

At the time of the theft, on June 19, Cartwright, who has 16 previous convictions, had been ordered to wear the electronic tag and had a suspended prison sentence hanging over him after a criminal damage offence.

Jailing him for two years Judge Alan Conrad, QC, told Cartwright today that he had 'a dreadful record' and that it had been 'a sophisticated offence'.

Trick: As Mrs Boydell guessed she was being tricked, another man suddenly appeared, jumped into her vehicle and drove off, while Cartwright leapt onto his bike and followed him, Liverpool Crown Court heard

He told the court that Cartwright had decided not to tell police where the car was, although he has since revealed where he last saw it.

The judge also said he was concerned by Cartwright’s unremorseful attitude when interviewed by a probation officer.

Judge Conrad ordered that the 12 week suspended sentence which Cartwright had breached should be served consecutively and he banned him from driving for two years.
