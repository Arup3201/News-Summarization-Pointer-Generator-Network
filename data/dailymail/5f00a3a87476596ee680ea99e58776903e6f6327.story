together a number of fights erupted with many fans kicking and throwing punches.

A small number of police officers rushed to the scene, and despite being overwhelmed, managed to push the fans apart.

around 9am, police on duty at Wembley spotted a large group
 of German fans fighting in the coach parking area of Wembley Stadium.

More than 150,000 fans descended on the capital for club football's biggest game, with 
many gathering in central London yesterday afternoon.

Supporters from both teams had been praised in the build-up to the big 
game with a party atmosphere in central London at some of the capital's 
famous landmarks.

Just
 under 90,000 spectators filled the home of football, including 
holders of 25,000 tickets officially sold to the fans of each club.

But an estimated 100,000 more are 
reported to have travelled without tickets by air, coach, ferry and 
Eurostar. There were 500,000 applications from Dortmund fans alone.

Many of the football fanatics gathered in Trafalgar Square as they counted down to the match.

landmarks and promote the team.

They displayed a joke poster 
featuring a deckchair next to a red phone box with a club towel on it and
 the slogan: 'From Dortmund with love'.

Londoners wished good luck to the 
fans in their silly hats and uniforms, but the love-in was spoiled by 
the German newspaper Bild.
