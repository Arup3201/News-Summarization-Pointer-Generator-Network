But tourists have already flocked to 
archaeological sites in Mexico and Central America where 'Apocalypse parties' are being held

With ten days to go before the Mayan apocalypse supposedly casts Earth into oblivion, time is running out for believers to find alien salvation.

But for those who have failed to book
 their spot in the shadow of France's Pic de Bugarach - apparently home to an extra-terrestrial mothership that will pluck believers to safety - there is another peak with similar powers.

Nestled deep within Serbia's Carpathian mountain range, Mount Rtanj is thought to house a 'pyramidal' structure left behind by alien visitors thousands of years ago that will emit a powerful force field at the moment of Armageddon, protecting those in its vicinity.

'The navel of the world'? Mount Rtanj, in Serbia, is thought to house a 'pyramidal' structure left behind by alien visitors thousands of years ago. New Agers believe it will emit a powerful force field that will protect them from Apocalypse

Now, hotels in the area are overflowing with doomsday cultists hoping to live past Christmas.

'In one day we had 500 people trying to 
book rooms. People want to bring their whole families,' Obrad Blecic, a 
local hotel manager, told The Telegraph.

Popular British science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke reportedly believed the peak contained a 'special energy' and labelled it 'the navel of the world'. 

Doom: An ancient Mayan calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns

Panic: The prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and has spread panic across the world

Mount Rtanj has long been believed to have mystical powers.

According to legend, a wizard lived in a great castle at its summit, guarding a hoard of buried treasure.

The castle is now gone, replaced by a small chapel to Patron Saint of England Saint George. The chapel, however, was destroyed by treasure hunters in the trying to unearth the hidden gold.

The mountain is also famed for its 'Rtanj tea', made from the savory herb and lauded as a powerful aphrodisiac and cure for chronic flatulence.

Ancient Mayans believed that a
5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count would come to a close  on December 21 2012.

Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, started counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21.

They
 say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle
 would be a milestone — but they have been keen to stress that it does 
not mark an end.

Conspiracy 
theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending 
astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from 
explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power 
grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's 
magnetic field.

The end-of-days prophesy is based on 
an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims an 
intergalactic planet is on a crash course with Earth and will impact on 
December 21 2012.

As 'zero hour' approaches, various theories have been posed as to how Planet Earth will meet its doom.

One claims that 
Nibiru, a rogue planet discovered by the ancient Sumerians, will crash into 
Earth on December 21, killing everyone.

The origins of those rumors have been 
linked to the works of the late Azerbaijani-born author Zecharia 
Sitchin, who wrote in 1976 that he had found and translated Sumerian 
documents identifying the rogue planet. Sitchin died in 2010 at the age 
of 90.

Scientists, however, say there is no such planet.

Another theory claims that the earth's magnetic field will reverse producing dire consequences such as violent hurricanes and the loss of all electronic communication systems.

Some believe the earth is unwittingly hurtling headlong towards a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way that will suck humanity into oblivion.

As a result, panic-buying of candles and other essentials has been reported in China and Russia, while in the United States the sale of survival shelters is booming.

News of Mount Rtanj's mystic powers follows claims that aliens will emerge from their 'spaceship garage' hidden deep 
within Pic de Bugarach mountain, in France's Pyrenees, and pluck anyone in 
the vicinity to safety.

Armageddon tourists and UFO spotters hoping for salvation have swarmed to the two-street hamlet where 'authentic Bugarach stones' are on sale for €1.50 (£1.20) a gram, a bottle of water from the local spring costs €15 (£12).

One landowner is even offering up his four-bedroom home with close up views of the mysterious peak for £1,200 a night, while tourists can also pop to the local Italian 
restaurant for an 'Apocalypse pizza', washed down with a local vintner's
'End Of The World' vintage.

But not everyone is taking the forecast so seriously.

Tourists have already flocked to archaeological sites in Mexico and Central America where 'Apocalypse parties' are being held to mark a new Mayan era on December 21.

Mexico is one of five countries preparing to observe the date, which marks the end of a more than 5,000-year era, according to the Mayan 'Long Count' calendar, which began in 3114 BC.

The start of the new Mayan calendar also is big business in this region, with tourism offices in no fewer than five countries aggressively promoting the date.

Millions of tourists are expected to flood into the region for celebrations that will include fireworks, concerts and other spectacles held at more than three dozen archaeological sites.

In addition to Mexico, celebrations will be held in Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador or Honduras, and at least two heads of state - President Otto Perez of Guatemala and President Porfirio Lobo of Honduras - have confirmed that they will take part in festivities in their respective countries.
