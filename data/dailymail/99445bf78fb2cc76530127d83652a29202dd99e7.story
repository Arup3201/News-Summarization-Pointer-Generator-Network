Schoolchildren returning to classrooms should be banned from choosing where they sit, under government rules.

Ministers say teachers should decide a seating plan for pupils and not just let youngsters pair up with friends.

Hardline guidance from Whitehall also includes threats of Saturday detentions, litter picking and writing out lines, and a demand for textbooks to be used instead of scruffy, photocopied worksheets.

Ministers have told teachers to take a tougher line on discipline, imposing a strict seating plan from the start of term and threatening pupils with Saturday detentions, writing lines or picking up litter

Millions of children return to lessons this week after their six week summer holiday.

Securing a good seat in the classroom used to be a key battle on the first days of term.

But ministers now say teachers must intervene and choose where every pupil sits.

Such a policy will stop disruptive pupils hiding at the back of the room, break up cliques of friends and ensuring the year groups chatterboxes are kept apart.

Tory education minister Lord Nash said: ’The Department believes that teachers should have a plan for pupil seating arrangements in classrooms, rather than leaving it to pupil preference or chance.

’Where and how pupils are seated will depend entirely on the lesson and its objectives. Teachers are best placed to take these decisions,' he said, in a series of responses to parliamentary questions.

The instructions are just the latest in a raft of rules designed to encourage teachers to take a stricter line on discipline.

It follows a survey which found one in three secondary school teachers ’lacked confidence in their powers to discipline pupils’.

As a result, new advice has been issued spelling out punishments teachers can use to bring pupils into line.

They include litter picking in the playground, removing graffiti and writing lines.

The Department for Education has also issued examples of how ’good schools manage behaviour’.

One radical idea is forcing children to attend school detentions on Saturdays, while others tell teachers and senior staff to be more ’visible’ during the school day.

’We remain determined to support schools in providing safe, calm and orderly classrooms where pupils can learn effectively, Lord Nash added.

Education minister Lord Nash said a return to textbooks would support the introduction of the new, tougher national curriculum

Teachers are also told to ditch worksheets and return to traditional textbooks as part of the new national curriculum.

It includes children aged five having to recite poetry by heart, 11-year-olds will sit maths exams without calculators and teenagers will study at least two Shakespeare plays.

Computer programming will be taught from five to 14, and foreign languages will be made compulsory at primary school.

There will be a new emphasis on spelling and grammar, and history will focus on the story of Britain. 

Lord Nash said: 'The Department for Education has made it clear that a return to textbooks would support the new national curriculum. 

'High-quality textbooks can prevent teachers from spending unnecessary time creating plans from scratch, and provide well-planned stretching activities for pupils.'
