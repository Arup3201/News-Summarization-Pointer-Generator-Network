Apple hasn’t confirmed any details about its upcoming handset, dubbed iPhone 6, but that hasn’t stopped knock-offs already hitting the market.

Users of Weibo have spotted a number of fake models claiming to be the next-generation device on sites such as China’s Taobao.

The hardware appears to match many of the rumours circulating about the phone, but experts believe the software is, instead, a skinned version of Android.

Reports claim Apple will introduce a new 4.7-inch iPhone alongside a larger 5.5-inch model later this year. 

The claims are said to have come from sources inside Apple’s supply chain. 

Apple’s display suppliers, including Sharp and LG, were expected to go into mass production last month.

Apple's iPhone 6 is also rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm.

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. 

By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm.

Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 8.1mm thick.

The phones are advertised from around 199 yen, which equates to just £18, or $32.

Images of the cloned devices have been posted online by Nowhereelse.fr and placed next to the Samsung Galaxy S III for comparison.

Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6, all with a thin, curved device and distinctive white 'bars' across the back.

However, a Japanese news agency recently claimed the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen.

Nikkei said the leaked pictures all show flaws - such as buttons that do not fit properly, of misaligned screens.

They claim this is because the units are unfinished - and that the final version will have polished glass in place of the bars seen in pictures.

It was thought Apple would release two devices this year - a 4.7-inch model, and a 5.5-inch phablet-style device.

However, analysts believe the firm has hit problems manufacturing the handset's case and screen, and will now only launch the smaller version at an event scheduled for September.

The handset is expected to have a new 'indestructible' sapphire glass screen and is still larger than the current 4-inch iPhone 5S.

Both iPhones are also thought to include an A8 system-on-a-chip for improved efficiency, performance boosts, and better battery life.

Apple also has the iWatch in the pipeline for release this year, which will include more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data.

Apple has been under pressure to release new products, as investors question whether the company that popularised the smartphone and the tablet computer is still able to innovate following the death of co-founder Steve Jobs.

Taiwan's Quanta Computer will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October, it has been claimed.
