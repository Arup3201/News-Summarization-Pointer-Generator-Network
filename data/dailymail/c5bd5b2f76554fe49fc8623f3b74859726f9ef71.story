The International Space Station will receive a historic package tomorrow - a parcel delivered by the first private company to successfully launch a module in to space.

The Dragon space capsule, launched on Tuesday, signals the dawn of a new 'space race', but one founded on profit and competition rather than nationalistic pride.

Today the unmanned module will fly-by the ISS, passing by at a 1.5 miles, a tiny distance considering the distances involved.

Scroll down for video of Tuesday's launch:

Today, SpaceX and NASE will remotely test the Dragon capsule's sensors and flight systems to check the module can berth with the ISS, which includes the 1.5 mile fly-by.

If NASA gives the green light, the Dragon will then approach the ISS on Friday.

The planned docking will be the first time a private ship has docked with the ISS.

The crew onboard the ISS will then use the station's robotic arm to capture the capsule as it drifts by, and then attach it to the orbiting research outpost.

The hatch of the Dragon will then open on Saturday to give the ISS a gift - 521 kilograms of cargo for the space lab.

On the last day of the month, Dragon will then depart back for Earth, hopefully splashing safely down in the Pacific.

The test flight of SpaceX's capsule, launched on the company's Falcon 9 rocket, will hopefully help America re-establish access to the ISS, after NASA retired its space shuttle fleet last year.

NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries told AFP: 'So far everything is going as planned', and said there was a 'sense of optimism' among the mission control team.

He added the capsule has completed the first part of its demonstration flight, including navigating via GPS, testing its reaction to an 'abort' demonstration, and a demonstration of 'free drift', a mode often used when interacting with the ISS.

The private space cargo firm's historic launch to the International Space Station blasted off at 8.44BST on Tuesday, carrying with it a capsule loaded with 1,000lbs of space station provisions.

Also on-board are the ashes of Star Trek legend James 'Scotty' Doohan, fulfilling his final wish to spend eternity resting in space.

While in space today, Dragon will go through a series of tests and will pass around one and a half miles below the station to see if its controls are testing properly.

If that checks out OK, the ISS will allow the Dragon capsule to within 10 feet and pull it in for docking all the while traveling at 17,500 mph.

Staying on board the space station for a week and a half, it will then be re-loaded and sent back to Earth where it will land in the Pacific and be retrieved.

The mission is the first by a private company to the $100billion orbital outpost, a project of 15 countries.

NASA is investing in SpaceX, as well as four other companies, to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles last summer.   

The first attempt on Saturday stalled, as the countdown reached all the way to practically zero before there was an automatic shutdown by on-board computers.

So instead of blasting off from Cape Canaveral on a delivery mission to the International Space Station, the rocket remained on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust.

Only governments have completed such a feat to date, with the SpaceX voyage the first time such a voyage has been completed by a private firm.

Ferrying the Dragon capsule into space, the mission to the ISS will be to deliver 1,000 pounds of non-essential cargo after passing a series of test maneuvers over the course of three days.

If successful in its first-of-a kind mission, the company behind the venture SpaceX would collect the remaining payments on the $396 million contract it has with NASA and then enter into a $1.6 billion agreement for 11 more flights to the ISS.

The first step in the commercialisation of space to non-governmental firms, SpaceX is hoping one day to deliver up to seven passengers to the ISS and other destinations in low-Earth orbit.
