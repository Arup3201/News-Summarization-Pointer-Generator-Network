Principles: Stevie Wonder has announced that he will no longer perform in any state which has a 'Stand Your Ground' law - specifically Florida - in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal

He said: 'I decided today that until the 'Stand Your Ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again. As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.'

He continued: 'The truth is that for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world, we can't bring them back.

'What we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That's what I know we can do.'

Florida officials have repeatedly said they will not consider scrapping the controversial law.

Zimmerman,29, was cleared of the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin after a trial that divided America.

'I decided today that until the ‘Stand Your Ground’ law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again. As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world. The truth is that — for those of you who’ve lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world — we can’t bring them back. What we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That’s what I know we can do.'

He has gone into hiding amid death threats.

Outrage over the Zimmerman verdict has led to an outpouring of anger on the streets of many US cities.

Black performers have used Twitter to express their anger that Zimmerman was not held accountable for the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.

Stars such as Jay-Z, Beyonce, A Tribe Called Quest and Q-Tip are among those who've dedicated live performances to the late teenager.

Since George Zimmerman's controversial acquittal, civil rights groups and leaders have called for legal action against the neighborhood watch volunteer.

On Sunday, in a move which could have dramatic ramifications, the Justice Department confirmed today that it will look into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal charges against George Zimmerman in the wake of his acquittal.

The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.

In a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of the civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and testimony from the state trial.

The statement said that, in the government's words, 'experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation.'

George Zimmerman's acquittal of the murder of Trayvon Marton has cast an enormous spotlight onto the controversial status of 'stand your ground' laws.The defense allowed people to defend themselves with force when they feel threatened in their home, business, car or any place they 'have a legal right to be'.However, at least 22 states have a similar law and it is not clear whether Stevie Wonder is aware of this, as he has only specifically mentioned Florida in relation to his boycott.The states where 'Stand Your Ground' exists in some form or another are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West VirginiaWhile George Zimmerman did not use 'stand your ground' as a defense, police did not arrest him for almost two months after Trayvon Martin's death.This was because police initially did not have the evidence to disprove Zimmerman's claim he acted in self defense, according to former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee.Mr. Lee resigned from Sanford police as a result of his failure to charge Zimmerman last year.Across the nation there are 22 states that have 'stand your ground law' with varying degrees of requirements of how and when deadly force is justified.Before 2005, a citizen was required to have attempted to flee the scene before defending themselves, but afterwards that was amended to remove the running away aspect.Some states just allow people to defend themselves in their homes or businesses, while others extend the law to cars or any place someone 'has a right to be.'

This moves follows demands from a furious NAACP for the Obama administration to intervene.

Already, over 100,000 people have signed up to an online petition and the NAACP has written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder urging the Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against 29-year-old Zimmerman.

In his first public statement since the verdict, President Barack Obama called for calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence.

'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,' Obama, the first black U.S. president, said in a statement.

'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.'

Obama, who last year said that 'if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' added that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings.

'And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,' he said.

The president urged Americans to broaden 'the circle of understanding and compassion' in their communities and put some of the emotion the case has aroused into curtailing gun violence.

'We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,' he said.

'We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.'

'That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin,' he added.

George Crump the family's attorney said that they will still be pursuing a civil case against George Zimmerman.

NAACP President Benjamin Jealous was unequivocal in his response to the not-guilty decision on Saturday by the Florida jury.

'We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,' NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement.

We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,' said Jealous.

Politicians such as Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y) and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson have all added their voices to the NAACP's position and demanded the administration review the case.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, called the verdict 'a sad day in the country' and 'a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country.'

'I think this is an atrocity,' Sharpton said. 'It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.'

Jesse Jackson called the verdict 'Old South justice.'

'I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,' Jackson said.

Jealous said Martin's family may bring a civil suit against Zimmerman but said federal criminal charges must be filed because evidence suggests race was a factor in the case.

He told CNN the black community is upset with a situation in which 'our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys. The robbers and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteer who think that they're keeping folks safer.'

Sharpton, who called the verdict 'a slap in the face to the American people,' cited the example of Rodney King, the man whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police triggered rioting two decades ago after a state criminal trial found the police officers not guilty.
