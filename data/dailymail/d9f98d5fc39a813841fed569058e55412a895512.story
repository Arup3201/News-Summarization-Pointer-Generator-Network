David Cameron has come under pressure to follow Spain's example tighten border controls

Britons living in Spain face tough income tests as the debt-ridden country launches a crackdown on migrants.

The move has led to demands from Tory MPs for David Cameron to take a tougher approach to EU nationals living in this country.

Earlier this month, Spain passed proposals for ‘proof of income’ and other tests.

Ministers hope to save 1billion euros (£780million) a year by forcing EU citizens to meet strict criteria if they wish to stay for three months or more.

Migrants must prove they have either a job or enough money to support themselves, and if they are jobless, they must produce health insurance.

If they cannot supply the evidence, their application for residency in Spain may be rejected.

It is unclear what effect the rules will have on those currently living in Spain. Currently, EU directives say that those living in member states for more than three months should not become an ‘unreasonable burden on social services’.

Yesterday, former Labour immigration minister Phil Woolas told the Mail on Sunday: ‘We do have the power to deport EU citizens – but they are ignored by the British authorities. We should heed the Spanish example and change our approach.’

The Home Office said yesterday it did not have figures for how many EU nationals were removed because they could not support themselves. Tory MP James Clappison, a member of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘This move drives a coach and horses through the freedom of movement principle and we should take inspiration from it.’

A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said: ‘We carry out enforcement operations up and down the country every day and wherever we encounter someone breaking the rules, we will take steps to remove them.’

A new ministerial order, slipped out by the Spanish government on July 9, states that any EU citizen living in Spain for more than three months must prove they will not become a financial burden on the State by producing a job contract or documents confirming they have enough money to support themselves.

If they are jobless, they must also show they are covered by health insurance. The decree, which potentially affects thousands of Britons seeking a new life in the country, declares that Spain will now adopt  a stricter interpretation of the ‘free movement’ principle.

The Spanish government has justified the measures by pointing to Article 7 of the 2004 EU directive on free movement, which gives EU member states the power to define it ‘without prejudice to national border controls’ – in other words, entry conditions can be imposed on other EU citizens by member governments.

Tough times: Spanish demonstrators take to the streets to protest against the country's austerity measures

The UK has also enacted the provision –
 and the Home Office insists that it does demand that EU citizens should
 not be ‘an unreasonable  burden on public funds’ before allowing them 
to stay in the UK.

Spain is in the grip of its worst  
economic crisis since the Forties and is almost certain to require a 
bailout in the coming weeks.

Official figures released on Friday 
show that unemployment has soared to a record 5.7 million – a staggering
 24.6 per cent of the workforce.

The centre-right government of prime 
minister Mariano Rajoy has introduced the new controls in an attempt to 
cut expenditure on health and social services. Health minister Ana Mato 
said recently that 700,000 foreigners had moved to Spain just to obtain 
free health care.

The country has become a favourite destination for ‘health tourists’ from other EU countries, attracted by short waiting lists, cheap treatment and excellent hospitals.

Under EU law, citizens of member states are entitled to receive health care in any member country. But Spanish authorities say their finances are being drained by the arrangement, with local media claiming Britons are the worst offenders.

In contrast to the Spanish regulations, EU citizens coming to live in Britain do not need to register or take out health insurance. And the only requirement on those not in work is that they should not become an ‘unreasonable burden’ on public funds. A spokesman for the Spanish Embassy in London said: ‘You either must hold a job or have the means to support yourself to ensure that you do not become a burden on the Spanish state.

‘Those people who do not hold a job would have to show that they have contracted a medical insurance service to cover them during their stay in Spain, and also that they have the appropriate means to support themselves and any other member of their families. Pensioners do not need medical insurance.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘This change simply brings Spain in line with many other EU countries. The British Embassy has issued guidance in English for British expatriates in Spain via its website. We understand the new rules will affect a relatively small number of expatriates.’

British holidaymakers would have borrowing limits on their credit cards lifted by the Government if they were caught up in the collapse of the euro, under new plans.

The move is one of a series of measures being considered by crisis- management teams in No 10, the Foreign Office and the Treasury following advice that Greece’s exit from the single currency is ‘near inevitable’ – and could come before the end of the summer-holiday season.

The deepening economic malaise on the Continent has led to the conclusion at the top of the Government that there will soon be an ‘orderly ejection’ of Greece from the euro – probably with only a few days’ notice.

If this ‘Grexit’ occurred in the height of the summer season, hundreds of thousands of British tourists could be stranded with euros that are no longer legal tender. Cash machines could freeze and credit-card companies are unlikely to process transactions.

The UK Government’s primary aim would be to avoid panic by allowing British tourists to remain in Greece until the end of their holiday.

Proposed measures include offering taxpayer-backed guarantees  to credit-card companies, enabling tourists to use the cards without  borrowing limits.

The companies would then be compensated for any losses. Euros could also be exchanged for Sterling on their return, with the British taxpayer again bearing the burden.

A Foreign Office source said: ‘We will have a key role to play in making sense of a confusing situation.’

GERMANY, Italy and France have pledged to do ‘whatever it takes’ to shore up the stricken euro, prompting speculation that the European Central Bank may take further measures. Meanwhile, 51 per cent of Germans think they would be better off leaving the euro and 71 per cent want Greece to leave if it does not meet its austerity promises, according to a survey.
