A DJ has become an internet sensation after he refused to take part in the 'NekNominate' drinking craze, choosing to finish his coffee instead of downing a cocktail of alcohol.

Ashley Abernethie, 25, from Plymouth was invited to join Facebook boozing game where users film themselves downing drinks before nominating others to do the same.

But instead of following in the footsteps of thousands of other social media users who have guzzled spirits and beer, he took a stand, finished his hot drink and said: 'It's getting a bit out of hand'.

The game has been linked to two deaths in Ireland, but videos of people consuming alcohol, as well as urine, dog food and even live goldfish, are still sweeping the web.

Refusal: Ashley Abernethie, 25, was invited to join Facebook boozing game where users film themselves downing a drink before nominating others to do the same. But instead of consuming alcohol he swilled coffee

In a minute-long video rebuke, the club DJ and producer said: 'Cheers for the nomination. To be honest, I've seen it all now on the internet.

Viral hit: The video has been liked by more than 50,000 people and shared over 11,000 times

'People necking dog food, goldfish, eggs - disgusting amounts of alcohol in a pint glass. I'm not one for not getting involved, but it's now getting a bit out of hand .

'For me to do anything that's going to create lots of likes, I would have to do something that's probably going to hurt me.'

Instead, Ashley finishes his coffee before adding: 'I will neck my coffee and go to work. Cheers.'

Ashley's video has amassed nearly 50,000 likes, 12,000 shares and hundreds of supportive comments since it was posted on Sunday. 

The club DJ said he was 'overwhelmed' with support shown by people backing his video.The married radio presenter, of Plymouth, said: 'The video was just a spur of the moment thing.

'When
 I posted it on Facebook I was expecting people to give me a bit of a 
ribbing or call me a wuss - but the response was the exact opposite.

'I've been overwhelmed with supportive messages, particularly from mums across the world worried about their kids.

'One wrote to say said I'd given her 
15-year-old son the strength to say no. We know from what happened in 
Ireland that this game can be deadly.

'I'm just happy to spread the message that this stuff is dangerous.'

Ashley sees plenty of drinking while working as a DJ but he reckons NekNominate takes it to dangerous levels.

He added: 'Don't get me wrong, I like a drink. I've downed beer, shots that sort of thing. But NekNominate is utter madness.

'A friend told me that someone he knew ended up in hospital having his stomach pumped after downing a litre of vodka.

'I've also seen videos of people necking urine, condiments, even some bloke drinking three live goldfish.

Support: Mr Abernathie said he was overwhelmed by the response to his video

'People feel they have to do this sort of stuff because their friends are into it but they are risking their health.

'It's not cool, so don't do it. Have a pint and a game of pool with your mates instead.'

One user, James Prowse says: 'Love this the party man himself goes famous for being anti-neknom!! Lmao.'

Paul Day added: 'Fantastic mate. Love the approach. About time someone was sensible! Legend!'

Ashley's
 intervention comes after police and alcohol awareness charities warned 
about the 'catastrophic dangers' of NekNominate after it was linked to 
two deaths in Ireland.

Advice: Pictured with his wife Amy Louise, he said on Facebook: 'It's not cool, so don't do it. Have a pint and a game of pool with your mates instead.'

Peer pressure: He said people are risking their health by getting involved in the game

The Neknominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world.

The
 concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck 
your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. 
The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink 
Responsible'.

The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet.

One
 popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down 
the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain 
bowl to lap it up.

Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'Young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in, but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise.

'Quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess, there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the 'cyber shame' some young people may experience.

'Drinkaware research shows nearly half of 18 to 24-year-olds admitted 'un-tagging' drunk photos of themselves on Facebook that they didn't want others to see.'

Devon and Cornwall Police urged more Facebook users to follow Ashley's example and refuse to play NekNominate.

A spokesman said: 'Getting involved in such irresponsible activity not only poses obvious health risks but increases the possibility of anti-social behaviour and other criminal behaviour which, ultimately, can have a devastating effect on a young person's life which they may later regret.'

Two young men died in Ireland over the weekend, both suspected victims of the 'NekNominate' drinking craze.

Ross
 Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early 
hours of Saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was
 drinking spirits at the time of his death.

Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination.
