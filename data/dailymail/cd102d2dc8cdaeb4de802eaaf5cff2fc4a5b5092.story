Team Sky are expected to unveil a string of ambitious new targets when they outline another five-year plan at the British squad's Majorca training camp on Sunday.

Team principal Sir Dave Brailsford raised eyebrows in 2009 when he announced his aim for a British Tour de France winner within five years but victories for Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and Chris Froome 12 months later ensured his optimism was more than justified.

Now the irrepressible team boss is ready for a fresh challenge.

Sir Bradley Wiggins' relationship with Team Sky will end in April as he prepares to launches own cycling team

A chastening experience at last year's Tour de France means the team will first and foremost be desperate to see Froome regain the yellow jersey after he was forced to pull out on stage five following three crashes in two days.

It will be no easy task for the 29-year-old, who was initially reluctant to commit to the race given a route which does not seem to favour him compared to reigning champion Vincenzo Nibali and six-time Grand Tour winner Alberto Contador.

It may also mean a different approach for the team too.

Sir Bradley Wiggins will bring an end to a five-and-a-half-year affiliation with Team Sky in April

Brailsford insisted last summer he would not "throw the baby out with the bathwater" but last year's Tour was the first time Sky had come away without a stage win since their debut in 2010, and a wider process of reinvigoration may be required.

Aside from the Grand Tours, a victory in one of the major Spring Classics continues to elude Brailsford's men and the main target will be Paris-Roubaix, which gets under way on April 12.

Welsh rider Geraint Thomas, who impressed at the Tour de France, came seventh last time out but the heaviest burden of expectation will sit on the shoulders of Wiggins.

The four-time Olympic champion finally confirmed the launch of 'Team Wiggins' on Thursday and Paris-Roubaix will likely be the 34-year-old's last competitive road race for Sky before he returns to the track and diverts his focus entirely towards Rio 2016.

Ben Swift and Peter Kennaugh will be hoping to benefit from the team's latest innovations in 2015

Wiggins' final contract with Sky expires in April, bringing an end to a five-and-a-half-year affiliation that Brailsford described as "one of the greatest stories in British sport over the last 10 years".

Brailsford will also have to answer questions on doping after another eventful 12 months off the bike.

The team terminated Jonathan Tiernan-Locke's contract in July after discrepancies were found in his biological passport and they fielded criticism too regarding Froome's use of TUEs (therapeutic user exemption certificate) for asthma medication at the Tour de Romandie.

Sky's zero-tolerance approach to doping effectively rules out the recruitment of a number of more experienced riders and coaches but, despite boasting a vast budget, Brailsford has always maintained a preference for younger talent.

Thomas, Ben Swift, Andy Fenn, Luke Rowe and Peter Kennaugh will be among those hoping to benefit from the team's latest innovations in 2015.
