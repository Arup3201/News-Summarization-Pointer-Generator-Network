Edinson Cavani is intent on leaving Paris Saint-Germain in a move that will invite an offer from Manchester United in the summer.

According to sources at the club, the Uruguay striker is unhappy with his role at the club - particularly because of the system favoured by Laurent Blanc.

The PSG boss uses Cavani on one flank or the other to accommodate Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the attacking spearhead, but the 26-year-old has had enough.

A move would bring an end to a short-lived relationship - the French side having shelled out £54million for his services back in July.

Evidently, Blanc has done his utmost to make it work and keep Cavani onside, but there is now an acceptance he will be allowed to leave.

As previously reported by Sportsmail, PSG will not entertain the idea of selling him this month, but the thought of capturing one of Europe’s most accomplished finishers for next season must appeal to United manager David Moyes.

The news comes as United are geared up for the £37m arrival of Juan Mata - a signal of intent that the board are willing to back Moyes in order to arrest an alarming slide this season.

They lie a staggering 14 points off top spot in the Premier League and are out of both domestic cup competitions.

Moyes' misery was compounded on Wednesday night when his side conspired to go out of the Capital One Cup on penalties against Sunderland at Old Trafford.
