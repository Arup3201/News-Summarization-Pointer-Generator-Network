An alleged arsonist has been arrested on suspicion of starting an out-of-control Northern California wildfire that has driven nearly 2,800 people from their homes and continues to grow, authorities said on Thursday.

Wayne Allen Huntsman, 37, is suspected of starting the fire east of Sacramento on Saturday, authorities said at a news conference today. He was arrested late on Wednesday in Placerville and booked into El Dorado County Jail, where he was being held on $10 million bail.

Huntsman is charged with one count of arson of forest land for willfully and maliciously setting a fire, according to a criminal complaint. He also faces a special allegation of arson with aggravating factors because the blaze east of Sacramento put a dozen firefighters in serious danger, forcing them to deploy their fire shields. They all escaped unharmed as it emerged today that four crew had lost their homes. 

By Thursday, the blaze had burned through 111 square miles - doubling in size overnight on Wednesday - as winds surged to 25 mph and continued to fuel its rapid expansion, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The King Fire doubled in size from 44 square miles on Wednesday when it forced additional evacuations. It was 5 per cent contained.

'This fire is definitely eye-opening,' Cal Fire spokeswoman Alyssa Smith said as it emerged that four firefighters had lost their homes in the furious blaze.

The fire has been fueled by heavy timber and grass that is extremely dry because of California's third straight year of drought.

Many of the more than 2,000 threatened homes were in Pollock Pines, 60 miles east of Sacramento. Though the fire grew substantially late on Wednesday, it burned mostly into wilderness land in the El Dorado National Forest away from the town, according to Cal Fire.

The blaze was burning about 20 miles from the Desolation Wilderness, a popular hiking area south of Lake Tahoe.

Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency late on Wednesday, freeing up funds for the two fires. Brown had also secured federal grants to fight each of them. 

A NASA satellite image, taken on Wednesday, revealed just how far the King Fire had spread as a towering cloud of smoke rose into the sky.

This image provided by NASA shows the King Fire taken by satellite on Wednesday. The out-of-control wildfire in Northern California threatened more than 2,000 homes and consumed huge swaths of timber land east of Sacramento while another town near the Oregon border took account of the damage done by a wildfire that burned 200 homes earlier in the week

Fire crews in California's rugged Sierra Nevada battled to gain the upper hand yesterday against a blaze that threatened at least 2,000 homes in the area

East of Sacramento, 2,500 firefighters took on the blaze that was threatening 2,003 homes and another 1,505 smaller structures, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.

'It's been an explosive couple of days,' added CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant.

Most of the threatened homes were in Pollock Pines, 60 miles east of Sacramento. Hundreds of them are under evacuation orders, but it was not immediately clear exactly how many.

'We are faced with a large and dangerous fire,' Laurence Crabtree, a U.S. Forest Service supervisor for the Eldorado National Forest, told the Sacramento Bee. 'We have had significant losses of public timber land, private timber land and watershed.'

In the town of Weed, teams of firefighters went house-to-house on Wednesday to pin down the damage done by a wildfire that began on Monday.

Officials estimate that it has destroyed 110 homes and damaged another 90. Four firefighters lost their homes.

The new figures  brought a marked increase from the initial estimate that a total of 150 structures had been destroyed or damaged in the blaze that rapidly swept across the town.

Two churches, a community center and the library also burned to the ground, while an elementary school and the city's last wood-products mill were damaged by flames that had been pushed by 40-mph winds.

'I mean it was devastating,' said Maureen Campbell, music minister at Holy Family Catholic Church who was baptized, confirmed and married at the church, along with her children. She lost her home to the fire.

'The house up there is no big deal. It can be rebuilt,' she said. 'But this is my family church, you know? It's much more endearing to me.'

Blowing embers started spot fires as much as a half-mile ahead of the fire front, and evacuations were called for the town of Weed

Tasha Davis, 30, said she was given two minutes to grab what she could from her apartment and evacuate.

'We then packed my car and sat on the road and just watched everything burn,' she said on Tuesday in an email from Mount Shasta, where she spent the night with her family. 

Insurance companies worked to find places to live for the people who lost their homes.

The cause of the blaze was under investigation. It was 60 per cent contained after burning 375 acres. The town and the forest that surrounds it were a tinderbox this summer after three years of drought.

The steady breezes were what attracted town founder Abner Weed to build his lumber business there in 1897, after he realized that wood dried more quickly when fanned by nature. 

But it is these winds - reaching up to 40mph -  that helped the wildfire rage across the lumber town.

'It went through here so fast it was unbelievable. I've never seen anything like this,' Jim Taylor, a retired butcher who has lived in the town for 30 years said Tuesday. 'I'm not a real religious person, but somebody was looking out for me.'

Taylor said fire bombers dropped retardant over his house. As his home and his deck furniture turned pink from the retardant, another house nearby erupted into flames. 

Across the street, pine and oak trees were burned to a crisp, and small flames and smoke drifted up from chunky embers. 

Burned neighborhoods remain off-limits, but people have been finding ways in since the fire started.

The Rev. Bill Hofer, pastor of Weed Berean Church, said power was back on in his home, which was still standing on the edge of the devastation zone, and he was planning to return Wednesday night - despite the evacuation order - to deter vandalism.

'The more people home with the lights on, the better,' he said.
