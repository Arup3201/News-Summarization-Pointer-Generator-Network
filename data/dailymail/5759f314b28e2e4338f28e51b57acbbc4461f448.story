A man who was charged over a hijack scare on a Virgin flight from Brisbane to Bali has been found not guilty of interfering with a crew member.

Matt Christopher Lockley, 28, triggered the airline's hijack procedure in April when he allegedly bashed on the cockpit door and demanded entry.

Mr Lockley, from NSW in Australia, pleaded not guilty to interfering with a crew member in October, arguing he was trying to get into the toilet and was confused because he was having a panic attack.

The Brisbane Magistrates Court heard Lockley, who was suffering from a medical condition, was paranoid that someone had interfered with his luggage.

Magistrate Judith Daley on Friday found Lockley not guilty of interfering with the crew as there was insufficient evidence he had meant to knock on the cockpit.

She also accepted that he was suffering from an undetermined medical condition.

Lockley said he 'definitely had a panic attack'.  

He told reporters outside court, 'I am very relieved ... I never tried to get in anywhere, it was a big misunderstanding.

'It's been a lot of stress for myself and my family. We're all very, very happy. At the moment I want to jump up and down but I'm still a bit shocked, that's for sure.'

The 28-year-old said his employment was on a fly-in fly-out basis and he had flown since the incident.

He referred to the saga as 'traumatic' and said he was relieved there would be no permanent impact on his job.

'There had been dramas as you could understand, but it's all good now.' 

 Mr Lockley was flying to Bali to search for his Indonesian wife who had left him, reports ABC.

Mr Lockley allegedly sparked the international incident en route to Bali in April, when attendants activated Virgin's hijack procedure drill

Flight attendants had previously testified that about four hours into the flight Lockley complained that other passengers had tampered with his bag and that he was being followed. 

Mr Lockley told flight attendants he knew 'the ramifications of entering Indonesia with illicit drugs'.

Lockley allegedly complained of feeling claustrophobic, and said he had 'perhaps watched too many movies and he'd had a drink the night before', flight attendant Abigail Tilley said. 

Attendant Angela Demo said Lockley's eyes were dilated and he seemed nervous and possibly under the influence of drugs. 

Mr Lockley was later seen pounding loudly on the cockpit door, rattling the handle and saying, 'let me in'.

Ms Demo said when Lockley refused to stop she activated Virgin's hijack procedure drill by giving a verbal code to the flight deck.

'I was frightened,' she said.

'I came across as feeling threatened and felt that he was being aggressive.'
