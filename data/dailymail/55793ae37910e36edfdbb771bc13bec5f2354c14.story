Jailed: Nicole Minetti has been sentenced to five years for grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi's bunga bunga parties

An Anglo-Italian showgirl has been sentenced to five years in prison for procuring and grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi’s bunga bunga parties.

Nicole Minetti, whose mother is British, acted as a Madame running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-premier’s sex parties, a court in Milan ruled.

Minetti, 28, a regional councillor for Berlusconi’s People of Freedom party in Milan, helped to recruit 33 female guests, who were given envelopes stuffed with 500 Euro notes and expensive gifts after the dinners at the prime minister’s luxury villa near Milan.

Convicted alongside Miss Minetti were former TV anchor Emilio Fede and talent scout Lele Mora who each received seven year jail sentences.

Prosecutor Pietro Forno had told the court that Minetti acted as ‘the brothel manager, paying salaries and choosing locations’.

Files included a telephone tap transcript in which a former police officer told a friend sordid details about the bawdy parties.

He said: ‘Minetti was there with her chest out kissing Berlusconi continuously. It was a real whorehouse. All the girls were given rings and necklaces.’

In a separate but related trial that ended last month, Berlusconi was convicted of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, then just 17.

Ruby, real name Karima El Mahroug, who testified at Minetti’s trial, reportedly performed a lesbian kiss with Minetti at one of the bunga bunga parties.

El Mahroug told the court that Minetti was a central figure at the parties and had dressed up as a nun for Berlusconi before stripping down to her underwear.

Minetti had been lining up call girls just hours before the investigation into Berlusconi began, the court heard.

In text messages intercepted by investigators, Marystell Polanco, a television star, wrote: ‘Papi is here Saturday,’ to which Minetti replied: ‘How do you know he is here Saturday?’

At the same time Minetti messaged the glamour model Floriana Marincea writing: ‘He’s here Saturday. We absolutely must be there. Do you have a pretty friend we can take?’

Miss Marincea texted back: ‘Yes, I’ll find someone, pretty.’

Miss Minetti replied: ‘Who is it?’ getting the reply: ‘She’s very trustworthy, good-looking. I’ve known her since she was 14 and she’s now 25.’

But the defence claimed Minetti was ‘not the organiser of the parties but instead one of many women who had an affectionate relationship with the prime minister - some were given Land Rovers others were given positions in local government.

Former lawyer Corso added the relationship was a bit like 'you scratch my back and I will scratch yours'.

A trained dental hygienist, Minetti, whose mother Georgina Reed is from Newcastle upon Tyne, treated Mr Berlusconi’s broken teeth after he was hit in the face with a statue at a rally in December 2009.

There were raised eyebrows when despite zero experience she was entered as a candidate for local elections, winning a seat on the council for the Lombardy region.

In a ‘spontaneous declaration’ to the court, Minetti claimed she had been in a relationship with Berlusconi.

‘He began court me discreetly and I don’t deny being fascinated by him,' she said.

She added: ‘My feelings for the prime minister were true love.’

Last night Minetti’s lawyer Pasquale Pantano said she was ‘stupefied by the excessive sentence’.
