The TV licence fee could be scrapped and replaced with subscriptions in the biggest shake-up since the BBC was founded in 1922.

Some members of the Cabinet are understood to believe the compulsory £145.50 annual charge for television ownership is increasingly outdated.

Senior industry figures also believe a fundamental rethink is required in a multi-channel age with more and more viewers using computers and mobile phones to watch programmes on internet catch-up services.

Last week Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told the Mail the licence fee could be cut, saying: '£145.50 is a lot of money for some people'

The BBC’s royal charter, which sets out the corporation’s scope and remit, and funding arrangement – both ten-year agreements – is up for renewal at the end of 2016.

The Government has already announced a review of whether non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised. Ministers say it cannot be right that 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a TV licence.

They face fines of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, with more than 50 a year going to prison.

One possibility is for new technology to be used to cut off BBC channels for those who have not paid. 

Decriminalising non-payment for a licence, supported by most of the Cabinet, would pave the way for more fundamental reform in the charter review, which will begin in earnest after the election.

David Elstein, who was a member of a review panel set up by the BBC to assess the corporation’s future, strongly supported decriminalisation of the non-payment of licence fees

One possibility is a subscription model, whereby viewers who want BBC services purchase a ‘bundle’ of channels, or even individual programmes or series. 

Subscriptions could replace some or all of the compulsory licence fee – breaking the link between owning a TV set and the licence fee. 

An alternative model, being used in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, would see a payment for the national broadcaster simply rolled into household taxes.

Like other areas of public spending it would be subject to cuts in times of austerity.

Last week Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told the Mail the licence fee could be cut. ‘£145.50 is a lot of money for some people,’ he said. ‘It’s incumbent on all public bodies to be vigilant when spending other people’s money and the BBC is no exception to this.’

The Commons culture and media committee has launched an inquiry into the future of the BBC. John Whittingdale, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told a party conference meeting this week it was ‘getting steadily harder to sustain the licence fee’.

He described compulsory licences as deeply unfair on those who cannot afford to pay the fee and end up in jail.

David Elstein, a former Sky and ITV television executive, who was a member of a review panel set up by the BBC to assess the corporation’s future, said earlier this year: ‘It is socially unjust that so many are fined and indeed go to prison for not paying the licence fee.

‘And it makes more sense too for the BBC to move to subscription from 2020, which is about the date when set-boxes go, and standard definition TV is phased out.’

You need a TV licence if you watch or record TV as it is being broadcast. This includes the use of devices such as a computer, mobile or DVD recorder. Under a subscription model, rival broadcasters such as ITV would be free.

A BBC spokesman said: 'At 40p a day the Licence Fee is tremendous value and ensures that everyone gets access to great content that informs, educates and entertains. 

'Support for the licence fee has risen by 22 per cent since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the BBC across all ages and socio-economic backgrounds.'
