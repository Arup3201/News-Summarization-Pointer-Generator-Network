It was a stunning goal that will live long in the memory - Robin van Persie soaring through the air to head Holland level in their World Cup opener against defending champions Spain.

Here, from Daley Blind's inch-perfect 50-yard ball from the flank to his exuberant high-five celebration with coach Louis van Gaal on the sidelines, here's the goal step-by-step.

A routine ball out from the back comes to Daley Blind who controls the ball, takes another touch and looks up to Van Persie calling for the ball

The Manchester United striker spots an opportunity with Gerard Pique jeopardising Spain’s high line by dropping back to mark Arjen Robben, Blind’s most likely target

With Van Persie sprinting for space, Blind gambles and hits a 51-yard pass from the left-hand touchline in search of his side’s chief goal-getter

Van Persie knows by now that he is Blind’s intended target and he darts away from a surprised Sergio Ramos, who is left trailing in his wake

With Ramos’ marking now an afterthought, Van Persie is on his own as he reaches the edge of the area. But with Blind’s ball coming in a couple of yards ahead of him he recognises that he needs to improvise

Iker Casillas comes off his line to help deal with the danger of Van Persie running through, only to realise that the Dutchman is certain to get there first

Van Persie throws himself, head first, at the ball as it comes across him and makes contact that most would struggle to control from 15 yards out

The 30-year-old centre forward’s header brilliantly floats above the Spanish ‘keeper with van Persie watching on as he falls to the floor

Casillas can only watch on as the header drops beneath the crossbar and nestles neatly in the back of his net

Van Persie, by now sprawled on the ground, watches his wondergoal cross the line before jumping up to celebrate with Louis van Gaal on the touchline
