First a declaration.

Malky Mackay is a man I have known and liked for 16 years.

To describe him as a personal friend would be stretching things but you take people as you find them.

In football, players are quick to take umbrage at negative writeups but, in 20 years as a journalist, Mackay remains the only one ever to utter a thank-you for a good one.

Revelation: How Sportsmail broke the story of Mackay and Iain Moody's text message exchanges

Sorry: Mackay issued a poorly-worded statement through the League Managers Association

In May, our professional acquaintance, stretching back to his days as a Celtic defender, prompted an invitation to the annual Scottish football writers' awards dinner.

Mackay and his father couldn't make it. If he had, some of those hammering him now would have been quick to shake his hand.

There comes a time, of course, when you simply cannot defend the indefensible.

Text messages of a gravely ill-judged, offensive nature have left Mackay clinging to his personal and professional reputation. His career is on the line.

People now ask openly if he can possibly hope to return to frontline management, while those of us who have always regarded him as a thoroughly decent man have a sense of unease over recent revelations.

Ten of the 12 shocking text messages exposed by this newspaper were sent by former Cardiff colleague Iain Moody.

Of 10,000 communications found on Moody's computer, Mackay last night admitted sending three. And three is too many.

One referred to 'fkn chinkys' in relation to his South Korean signing Kim Bo-Kyung. It was crass and degrading.

Another concerned football agent, Phil Smith, and was hurtful and anti-Semitic in nature.

To a public who previously regarded him as a solid citizen, Mackay is now tarnished. But the fact the texts are grossly at odds with his public persona make this a disturbingly sad story.

In a bid to stem the loss of blood, the League Managers Association issued a statement on Mackay's behalf. 'I'm sorry' might have sufficed but, instead, the texts were described by the usually slick LMA as 'friendly text-message banter'.

A poorer choice of words is hard to imagine. It suggested a casual, almost complacent, approach to racism in British football.

The LMA were, quite rightly, apologising for their apology.

There is now a long line of critics setting their sights on Mackay. Some branded him an 'abhorrent individual'. The vast majority of whom have never met him.

Shock: Moody, Crystal Palace's director of football and Mackay's former colleague, was also reported

Let's be clear. There shouldn't be a person anywhere who thinks these texts deserve anything other than the deepest condemnation. The Glaswegian's exchanges with Iain Moody were at the extreme end of the scale, no question.

They will plague him for the rest of his days. Just ask Ron Atkinson.

Sacked last December, the former Celtic defender's first mistake was to become more popular than Cardiff owner Vincent Tan. His second was to pursue him for compensation.

Tan appeared to win that spat in May when Mackay issued an 'unreserved apology' for his role in his own sacking and dropped his compensation claim against the club.

From there, the Scot hoped both parties could move on. But Tan is clearly not a man to either forgive or forget.

He appears to have held the worst of the texts back as a loaded gun. And he fired the bullet in a missive to the Football Association the day before Mackay planned to become the new manager of Crystal Palace.

A coincidence? Possibly. But the problem for Mackay is that Tan is beginning to look like a wronged party in all of this. Like a reformed campaigner shining a light on the seedy underbelly of racism, sexism and homophobia in British football.

A cynic might see him as something else. They may see a rich man with a grudge who is nursing a vengeful desire to settle old scores and get his way at any cost. A dangerous adversary hellbent on destroying Mackay while taking Richard Bevan, the chief of the LMA, down as well.

If you were to chose an enemy, you certainly wouldn't start with Vincent Tan.

You would pay a penny for current Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's thoughts right now. You would pay substantially more for Malky Mackay's.

He broke cover to offer up his apology. For the sake of his blameless young family and the people slighted by an ugly episode, it was the least he could do. Time will tell if it was enough.

Tortured Gazza's demise makes painful viewing 

The life of Paul Gascoigne has become a heart-rending tragedy. A slow moving train wreck increasingly likely to end in tears. Ours, not his. To supporters of Rangers, Newcastle United, England — even Celtic — the latest images on Mail Online of a once brilliant footballer are depressing, worrying and grim.

Clutching a bottle of gin, the former England international was captured, eyes half shut, face swollen, being led from his Dorset home by police. In one picture, he sat head in hands, looking older than his 47 years.

Some pictures require no caption.

The bleak truth is that Gazza is an alcoholic. He is ill. Last September, when dry, he spoke in a television documentary of his fears that he might start drinking again.

The fears proved depressingly well-founded. At the time, he spent his money on botox to counter the effects of the drinking and was spending £1,000 a year on cosmetic injections. This is how it goes.

Whatever Gascoigne does, he does to extremes. At one point, football was his high of choice. At Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Rangers, he was a mesmerising talent. 

The rights and wrongs of how Rangers financed their signings during the David Murray era are a source of lingering bitterness. But the sight of Gascoigne in the Scottish league added colour to a black and white scene. The problem was always going to come when the curtain fell and the floodlights dimmed.

Early promise: Paul Gascoigne in action for Newcastle against Tranmere in 1988

For a book on football's flawed geniuses, his former manager, Walter Smith, once told me: 'Those of us who knew Paul thought it was always going to be a problem once they took away the focal point of his life — the football. 'If he had been able to train for 16 to 18 hours a day, then come back the next day, he would have been happy.' That's not how life works, of course.

Eventually, even the fittest of men — those free of addiction and tortured nights — must hang up their boots.

And for most, it's the worst experience of their life.

The lifestyle, which sustained them on the straight and narrow, is bent out of all recognition. The lucky ones find solace in management. But Gascoigne was never cut out for that.

Nor was he equipped for an easy number on the Match of the Day sofa. Football simply had no place for him. And for all of us, that's a shame. Because when the cheers dry up, the tears are a truly painful sight.
