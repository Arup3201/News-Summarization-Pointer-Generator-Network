A photograph of Castle Howard, the 18th-century stately home which was immortalised in the television adaptation of Brideshead Revisited, dominates the web site of the local Thirsk and Malton Conservative Association.

Evelyn Waugh’s tale of middle-class Charles Ryder and the aristocratic Marchmain family is a classic of 20th-century literature.

But today a real-life drama is being fought out in the shadow of the imposing mansion, and it has the potential to cause severe embarrassment to David Cameron.

Battle: Anne McIntosh, left, could be ousted at the next election and replaced with Edward Legard, right

The sitting MP Anne McIntosh, 59, who has been fighting a year-long battle against deselection, will learn today whether she has seen off the local party bigwigs who want to get rid of her. If she loses, she will be the first female Tory MP in modern history to be sacked by her local party.

McIntosh has one of the few safe Conservative seats in the north of England, with a majority of 11,000. She is also one of only three women Tory MPs in the North.

But she has had to fight members of her own party to keep her seat on no fewer than three occasions. She survived her first deselection vote in 2006, as well as in 2009 and again in 2013. Now the 2013 ballot is being rerun and the outcome this time is far less certain.

McIntosh’s supporters claim she is the target of dirty tricks from old-guard diehards in the constituency association, who resent having a woman as their MP.

They say she was the victim of a vote-rigging row like the one in Falkirk in Scotland, which tore the Labour Party apart last year — when the Unite trade union was accused of boosting membership of the local Labour Party by paying people’s subscription without their knowledge, and using their votes to try to fix their own candidate’s victory.

On the face of it, the McIntosh supporters have a point. A leaked report of an inquiry into the affair revealed that the Thirsk Conservative association flagrantly broke the rules when it tried to deselect her last January.

Just before holding the vote, the association’s executive committee had taken on a significant number of new members — and it was these who ensured she was deselected.

The stench of misogyny also engulfed the process when one unnamed local activist told the Yorkshire Post their MP was a ‘silly girl’ who should be replaced by London Mayor Boris Johnson or Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

Long service: Anne McIntosh was elected in 1997 and is unafraid to criticise the government

The decision to force out McIntosh caused uproar. Her supporters demanded an inquiry by Conservative Central Office in London. Central Office set aside the vote and ordered that the executive committee should be reformed in accordance with the party’s rules.

Now, the local association is trying once again to get rid of its MP. And her critics believe it will be third time lucky.

Meanwhile, in a twist which could have come from the pen of Evelyn Waugh, a dashing former officer in the Light Dragoons called Edward Legard, an Old Etonian school chum of David Cameron, appears to be the choice of the party high command to replace Anne McIntosh.

So what is the truth? Do McIntosh’s critics have a genuine grievance against their MP? Or is this truly the Conservative Party’s Falkirk, in which unscrupulous chauvinists of the old guard are determined to see off a female foe at any cost — with Cameron supporters eyeing the chance to replace her with one of their own?

Whatever the case, there is no doubt that this episode has been deeply damaging to the Tories.

A report by the party’s disciplinary committee warned that the situation in the ‘divided and fractious’ association had ‘spiralled out of control’ and was ‘potentially damaging to the party’.

This time, all 560 members of the local party will vote on McIntosh’s future — as opposed to a cabal of just 30, which is what happened last January. And in a sign of the mutual distrust and loathing in the constituency, the ballot is being counted at Tory Party HQ in London, which will announce the result today.

What has created the crisis, according to local sources, is that McIntosh is a woman with a strong personality who has a knack for telling it as it is — and rubbing people up the wrong way.

None of her critics questions her work rate at Westminster, where she has missed fewer than 17 per cent of votes and spoken more than 100 times in the past 12 months — way above average.

But with the ballot result too close to call, even friends concede McIntosh can be ‘awkward’ and ‘difficult’ — which explains why she faces an unprecedented third no-confidence vote since first being elected in 1997 to what was the Vale of York seat before it became Thirsk and Malton.

Two former constituency agents in the Vale of York fell out with McIntosh. One of them, Diane Clarke, who is a now a regional director for the Tories, was said to have been reduced to tears more than once by the MP.

Her enemies also claim she has fallen out with 11 of her 12 association chairmen in the two constituencies in which she has served — a statistic denied by her allies. And if Ms McIntosh wins, it will be without the backing of some of the party’s biggest hitters, including Chancellor George Osborne and Education Secretary Michael Gove. Such Cabinet heavyweights have come to the aid of the former minister Tim Yeo, 68, who is facing a similar challenge in his Suffolk South constituency.

McIntosh’s supporters are in no doubt as to why there is a distinct lack of support from the Cabinet — although Foreign Secretary and neighbouring MP William Hague is a rare supporter. They believe the Tory high command is keen for the Prime Minister’s suave Eton chum Edward Legard to take over.

Legard, 47, a barrister and judge, is heir to a baronetcy created in 1660. After Eton with Cameron,  he went to St Andrews University and then Sandhurst, followed by UN peace-keeping duties in Bosnia. A well-connected local councillor for ten years, he is married with three children and looks and sounds like a future Cabinet minister.

It is all strikingly different from McIntosh who was born in Edinburgh, studied law at the city’s university, and worked in the EU before becoming an MEP in 1989. Happily married for 21 years to John Harvey, a business executive, she has  no children.

The fallout has led the small town of Thirsk to be dubbed the Tory equivalent of Falkirk, Labour's scandal seat

Despite her 17 years as an MP, she has been overlooked for ministerial office. She is chairman of the Environment and Rural Affairs select committee and only this week was criticising the Government’s handling of flooding in the West Country.

Legard, who lives in the constituency, insists he has not made any move against Ms McIntosh. Yet his name appeared — mistakenly, he says — on an email from two of her leading opponents attacking her record as an MP, which went to every member of the association.

‘It’s no secret I’m on the candidates list, but I don’t know what action I will take if Anne does not win,’ he says.

Spot the difference: The leadership has been keener to help Tim Yeo, who is in a similar predicament

Few Tories believe him. ‘Of course he’s going to run,’ said one supporter of Ms McIntosh. ‘He’s ambitious and we are convinced No 10 is behind him.’

If Mr Legard prevails it will reinforce the view that Mr Cameron’s Tory Party is dominated by a public-school-educated clique of white middle aged men. Whatever happens, the bitterness will linger in the association for years to come.

In picturesque Thirsk, home of James Herriott, author of the vet series All Creatures Great and Small, the feud in the Conservative party is a talking point in the bars and cafes dotted around the market square.

One of the most frequent gripes is that locals rarely see McIntosh in the constituency. A visit to her isolated property on an estate on the outskirts of Thirsk bears out that criticism — there is still Christmas tinsel on the window sill next to last year’s Christmas cards.

However, at Johnsons the butchers they were backing her. Andrew Truman, 44, the owner said: ‘She regularly calls in here and you see her at the cattle market doing her surgery. She’s a good MP and I would be sorry to see her go.’

Ronnie Duckett, who used to own a shop on the square, said: ‘I can’t understand what she’s done to upset them. She’s a good MP who fights our corner at Westminster.’ 

But Andrew  Newton, 40, a prominent local health campaigner whose six-year-old daughter has cerebral palsy, said: ‘I am heavily involved in the re-organisation of children’s hospitals and she will not talk to me. I’m a Conservative but if she is still the candidate next time I will stand as an independent. I’m serious. She has to go.’

Damp reception: The MP has poured disapproval on the government's response to floods in Somerset

A letter in the Darlington & Stockton Times from Ruth Robinson, a retired hotelier and well-known figure in Thirsk, goes to the nub of the argument: ‘As a consequence of her re-selection [last year], and possibly disenchantment with the present government, many loyal members cancelled their subscriptions.

'I am wondering what lessons Anne has learned from the fact that 11 chairmen have been unable to work with her and what it is that is driving her to attempt to cling on as MP in the teeth of opposition.’

In a statement, McIntosh accepted she had her detractors, but added: ‘I believe I have the support of the overwhelming majority of party members.’

She will find out soon enough — once this unedifying selection process which is tearing the Tories apart is finally decided.
