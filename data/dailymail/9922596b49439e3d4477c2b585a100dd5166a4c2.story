Bobbi Kristina Brown's aunt has claimed that her boyfriend Nick Gordon is being investigated by police for trying to murder her.

Leolah Brown wrote on Facebook that her family has 'strong evidence of foul play' relating to the day in January when Brown, 22, was found face-down in a bathtub.

She is currently on life support in Atlanta, Georgia. The dramatic claims are part of a long-running family feud between Gordon and other parts of the Brown clan.

Leolah made the claims - which she says law enforcement are aware of and following up - in response to Gordon, 25, being invited on the Dr Phil chat show.

In a message addressed to host Phil McGraw, she said: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece Bobby Kristina Brown.

'We have strong evidence of foul play. Until this investigation is completed by law enforcement, I would ask that you or anyone else not provide this individual a platform to spin this situation to his benefit.

'If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and/or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece's body was found in a bathtub, he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded.'

Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub at the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia.

Police in the town were not immediately able to comment on the attempted murder allegation when contacted by DailyMail.com. 

It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived. Few other details have emerged.

There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub.

Leolah kept up the attack in later comments on her Facebook page. She later wrote: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' 

The show is describing the episode,  due to air March 11, as an 'intervention'.

A spokesman for the show said Gordon and his mother, Michelle, described him as haunted by what happened to Brown and the similar tragedy that befell the late Whitney Houston. 

Houston was found face-down and unresponsive in about a foot of water in a bathtub in the Beverly Hilton hotel on Feb. 11, 2012, just before the Grammys.

On the show, Michelle said: 'As we sit here right now, my son's life hangs in the balance.  When Whitney was found, he administered CPR to her and called me as he was standing in front of her saying, "Mom, why couldn't I do it? I couldn't get air into her lungs."

'He won't let go of the guilt.'

Gordon said he has suffered mental anguish and panic attacks since Brown was found, and over Houston's death.
