Formally conjoined twins Emmett and Owen Ezell celebrated their first birthday yesterday ... with the very doctors and nurses who gave them life.

The twin boys, who were born sharing a kidney and intestine, returned to Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, Texas, for a party with balloons, presents and a giant cake.

And while they may have been separated just a month after their birth, they enjoyed their big day as one - wearing matching babygrows and red bow ties.

Happy family: Dad Dave plants a kiss on Emmett while mum Jenni laughs holding Owen as family, friends and staff from the hospital where the boys were separated in August look on

Separated: The twins, who shared a liver and intestines when born, left the hospital for inpatient rehabilitation in April and finally were able to go home in June

The boys, who turned one last week, were separated at the hospital last August, about a month after their birth.

The boys now breathe on their own but still rely on feeding tubes.

Growing up: Proud Jenni says Owen (pictured) is about to start crawling, and she thinks Emmett will soon be doing likewise

After the celebration, the boys will return to their home in Guthrie, Oklahoma, with their doting parents, Jenni, a speech-language pathologist, and Dave, a geologist. They have two brothers, Ethan, eight, and Liam, two.

Proud Jenni says Owen is about to start crawling, and she thinks Emmett will soon be doing likewise.

Writing earlier this month on her family blog, Jenni said: 'Owen is also learning to transition from sitting to tummy-time, and by transition, I mean he performs feats of acrobatics with similarities to failed somersaults.

Connected: The boys were born with a shared liver and intestines when born in July last year

Individual together: But since they were separated they are developing their own, very distinct, personalities

'It's exactly what it sounds like - leaning too far forward until he falls forward! It is quite cute.

'Emmett is too chill to try acrobatics yet. He is such a content baby, though when he sees a toy he REALLY wants, he will take a small tumble as well!

'Both boys are all smiles all the time, and I LOVE seeing their smiling faces first thing in the morning, throughout the day, and before they go to sleep.'
