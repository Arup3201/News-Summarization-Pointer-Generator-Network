Labour has accused the Tories of breaking a pre-election promise as it emerged that the vast majority of rail services will not be running today.

Seventeen major operators are offering no trains at all while the rest have only limited or Sunday services – causing misery for the public on a day when many families, as well as sports fans, will be trying to travel.

The Boxing Day shutdown comes despite the fact that the Conservatives in opposition repeatedly complained about a lack of rail services on the day after Christmas.

Football fans and  shoppers were left furious today as many were left unable to get to matches or the Boxing Day sales.

QPR fans hit out at South West Trains on Twitter as no services ran from into London from the western suburbs and towns.

Manchester United fans living outside the city are also selling their tickets online because Virgin Trains are not running services.

A Twitter user called Neil Armstrong wrote: 'Wish Virgin Trains would join the rest of us in the 21st Century and run a service today.'

He added: 'Given how much Virgin Trains hike prices for football fans, there must be serious profit to be made today.'

And a woman in eastern England tweeted: 'Just got to the train station for Boxing Day sales to find out there are no trains. Are you having a laugh Greater Anglia?'

Labour said the shutdown showed the Tories’ hypocrisy that four and a half years after taking power, they have done nothing to improve the situation.

In opposition, in 2008 and 2009, the Tories accused Labour of not having the ‘interest of the travelling public at heart’. But this year, there are almost no Boxing Day rail services across the country.

Michael Dugher, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: ‘The travelling public are facing misery on Boxing Day as yet again ministers have allowed the rail network to shut down for the day. Before the last General Election, the Tories repeatedly criticised the lack of rail services on Boxing Day.

‘But it is clear they have done absolutely nothing about it in government. Yet again, this Tory-led Government has been shown to be all talk and no action.’

The low level of service contrasts sharply with the demands of former Tory transport spokesman Stephen Hammond – now a transport minister – who in 2008 called for an increase in Boxing Day rail services.

He said at the time: ‘Boxing Day is a traditional sporting fixture across the country for many sports, not just football.

'Families and football fans will be given no choice but to get into their cars, pump more CO2 into the atmosphere and put up with potentially eye-watering levels of congestion because the railways remain shut.’

A year later he repeated the attack, saying: ‘If Labour had the interest of the travelling public at heart they would not cut people off from the railway at the very time when they need a fast, reliable and pleasant way to travel long distance across the UK.’

Yet today’s virtual shutdown comes on the fifth Boxing Day since the Conservatives took office and the third since Mr Hammond was appointed as a transport minister.

A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ‘Deciding the level of service on specific days is a matter for train operators. But we know passengers want to travel on Boxing Day, and that’s why we have worked with the rail industry to ensure there are limited services on some franchises on that day.

‘Network Rail and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open over the Christmas/New Year period and alternative routes are provided where the lines are closed for essential engineering work, and that these are communicated properly to the public.’
