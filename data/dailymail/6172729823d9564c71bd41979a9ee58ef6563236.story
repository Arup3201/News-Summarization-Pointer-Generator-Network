James Clarke, 22, who was paralysed in a motorbike crash in 2009, choked on a feeding tube after it became blocked in this throat at his home in Walsall, West Midlands, while carers left him unsupervised

Two carers watched TV and played on their phones while a quadriplegic patient they were supposed to be supervising suffocated to death in the next room, an inquest heard.

James Clarke, 22, who was paralysed in a motorbike accident in 2009, choked on a feeding tube after it became blocked in this throat at his home in Walsall, West Midlands.

An inquest into his death heard how two female carers were supposed to be monitoring him every 15 minutes throughout the night - but only checked on him every three hours.

Instead, Beverley Kent and Mandy Evans watched television in the living room and chatted and joked between themselves as James died next door.

Emergency services were called to the address after the carers found him unresponsive at 6am when his feeding peg bleeped.

The inquest at Smethwick Council House heard Mrs Evans gave chest compressions under instruction from 999 handlers until the ambulance arrived.

However rigor mortis had started to set in, further resuscitation attempts proved unsuccessful and he was declared dead at the scene.

Black Country coroner Robin Balmain yesterday slammed Mr Clarke's quality of care and ruled his death was due to neglect.

He said he would be writing to the Care Quality Commission demanding answers about the standard of care provided.

The coroner ruled that Mr Clarke, who a tracheotomy tube fitted to enable him to breathe following his accident, died of asphyxiation after the tube became blocked.

Mr Balmain blasted Complete Care Service - the company in charge of his care package - and described their approach as 'profit over performance.'

He also criticised the Walsall Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which employed the firm, for not checking that the correct care was being given.

Mr Balmain concluded that Mr Clarke's death on April 4, 2011 was due to neglect compounding injuries suffered in the motorcycle accident.

However, he said he sympathised with the carers, describing their training as 'slapdash' and said 'insufficient attention' was given by Walsall CCG as to what the care company was doing.

Mr Balmain added: 'They seem to have missed some pretty obvious failings.'

Mr Clarke was paralysed in a motorbike accident in March 2009, when he just 19 (pictured before the crash)

Mr Clarke had been left dependent on round-the-clock care following his accident in March 2009.

He fell from his bike and slid into the path of an oncoming car when he was aged just 19.

After nine months in hospital he returned home where he was cared for by his mother Paula with help from carers.

The carer's responsibilities included checking on his comfort and breathing, and changing his tracheotomy tube when necessary.

Night-time carers were assigned to him so his mother could sleep.

At 10pm on the night he died, the two women arrived to take over from Mrs Clarke who then went to bed.

Over the next eight hours the women only checked on him three times - at 1am, 4am and finally at 6am.

Giving evidence at the inquest, Mrs Kent claimed they had been told by Mrs Clarke's mother not to sit in the same room as her son in case they disturbed him.

But Mrs Clarke disagreed and the claim was dismissed by the coroner as 'unimaginable.'

In her statement to police, Mrs Kent said it was 'common practice' to sit in the living room.

Mrs Evans told police she was playing on her mobile phone as the two women chatted and watched TV with the volume turned down.

Asked how they would know when the tube required clearing, Mrs Evans said Mr Clarke would cough or give a 'rattling' sound.

Although the tracheotomy tube often became blocked and had to be cleared, carers had only been provided with classroom training but no practical tuition.

The inquest also heard that another firm employed to carry out the training had not been told until the last minute that it was for tracheotomy care, so no notes were handed out or demonstrations given.

Complete Care Services quality manager Manjit Kaur said she expected the instructions for Mr Clarke to be checked 'every so often' to mean 'every 15 or 30 minutes'.

After the case Steve Smith, managing director of Complete Care Services, said: 'As far as we were concerned, external trainers had signed our staff off as fully trained.'
