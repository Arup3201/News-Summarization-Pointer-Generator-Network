Meet Lolita Richi, the youngest 'Human Barbie' yet to emerge, who claims to be the most doll-like beauty yet.Â 

Lolita, 16, from Kiev, Ukraine, boasts the same improbable body proportions and blank facial features as a Barbie. She has a tiny 20-inch waist, a 32F bra size and wears contact lenses that give her a wide-eyed, doll-like stare.

Lolita maintains that her striking looks were achieved without plastic surgery, dieting or Photoshop.

At the age of just 16, Lolita claims to be the most doll-like beauty yet - and it's all natural (apart from the coloured contact lenses)

Lolita has a 20-inch waist, which she shows off in various costumes and outfits

Lolita, pictured aged six, says as a child she was a tomboy with no real interest in dolls or dressing up

The outspoken high-school student, who is now temporarily living in Turkmenistan, says: 'I think I've achieved this image better than anyone else. I'm the ultimate vamp woman. I haven't even heard of Valeria Lukyanov.

'People have openly told me that they're jealous of me and how good I look. All of the boys at school fancy me as well but I don't like any of them. They are not to my taste.'

Growing up, Lolita was a playful tomboy who showed no interest in her appearance.

She says: 'I never thought about playing with dolls when I was younger. I was always outside playing with the boys.'

Despite the provocative nature of many of the pictures she posts online, her mother approves - in fact, she takes all the photographs

Lolita claims she never uses Photoshop on her pictures and has never had any surgery

It was only a year ago that super-confident Lolita first adopted the doll look. She has since gained a devoted band of followers on Russian social network VK.

Lolita explains: 'I started dressing up like this because I want to look perfect. I think that all women should be well-kept and immaculate. I wanted to be my own inspiration.

'If a girl doesn't have beautiful eyes then they should wear contact lenses to sort it out. If they have a crooked nose, then she must do something about it, whether that's plastic surgery or not.

The confident teenager has amassed many fans on Russian social network VK

'I had great features to start with and I just improved on them. My big breasts are natural although I something wear a push-up bra to enhance them.

'I have a gorgeous figure so I don't even have to diet. I just eat whatever's available in the fridge whether that's sausages or fruit.

'I started wearing affordable contact lenses and make-up. My mother used to be an actress so I borrow her wigs.

'I feel comfortable and confident in my appearance. There are many women who want to look like this.'

However Lolita confesses that she does receive a fair share of negative criticism online.

She says: 'People make good and bad comments about me online. I've blocked a few users who have been particularly mean about my appearance.

'But I do get nice compliments too, I like when men admire my hands.'

Lolita hopes to find fame through her Barbie-like looks, but says her ultimate aim is to be a psychologist

One person who is wholly supportive of her eccentric look is Lolita's mother, Anya Richi, 33. Anya is her photographer and captures all of the snaps that Lolita uploads online.

She says:'My mum doesn't say anything about my appearance. She allows me to dress however I want. My mum's proud of how I look.'

Lolita says there is no man out there at the moment who is a worthy candidate for her affections.

'I'm not attracted to any of the boys at school, although they all like me. They aren't good enough for me and they have an immature mentality.

'I did have one serious boyfriend in the past but I dumped him because we kept having little disagreements. In the end, we were incompatible.

'I want to be with a really manly man who is polite, sensible and who doesn't run away from problems. He also needs to have a full head of hair. I don't like bald men.'

Lolita wants to become a psychologist after she finishes school but would love to achieve fame for her look.

She says, 'I'm only 5ft 4in tall so I can't become a model unfortunately. But if I can become famous for my appearance in some other way, I will be extremely happy.'
