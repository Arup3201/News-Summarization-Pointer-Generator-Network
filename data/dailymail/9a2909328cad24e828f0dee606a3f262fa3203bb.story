This is the moment a stunned group of Russian fisherman looked on in horror as their cars disappeared beneath the ice and into the freezing water below.

The friends had driven out to Gertner Bay in eastern Russia's Sea of Okhotsk for a spot of ice fishing.

They parked up on the frozen water and set up their fishing equipment a little distance off. The group had just drilled their fishing holes and settled down in the subzero temperatures to wait for a nibble when they heard a loud cracking sound.

That sinking feeling: A group of friends had driven out onto the frozen Gertner Bay in eastern Russia's Sea of Okhotsk when their cars began to disappear beneath the ice

Fisherman Iskander Aksakov, 45, said: 'We all looked at each other and then turned to see what had happened.

'We were all thinking the same thing - that the ice was cracking and we would go in.

'But when we saw it was our Jeeps going in we were completely shocked.'

The pictures reveal the men's desperate attempts to save their jeeps before they slipped into the Sea of Okhotsk.

'Someone shouted out 'Noooo' and ran over to try and grab his vehicle but it was too late,' added Iskander.

The other men leapt up and ran to try and save their vehicles as the ice melted taking some of the cars under.

Stunned Iskander Aksakov, 45, and his friends had left the cars parked up on the ice to go fishing when they heard the ice cracking under their weight and saw them sinking

The men had leapt up and attempted to save their vehicles as the ice melted taking some of the cars under

Some, such as Jaroslav Andrejew, were able to get to their jeeps before they went under- Andrejew then used it to pull out a friend's car

Jaroslav Andrejew, 38, said: 'Luckily, I managed to get to my car - a Toyota Surf - before it went down.

'I then tied a rope to the front and the other end to my mate's car and pulled it out.

'But there was no way I could get all of them.'

But not everyone was so lucky. Many of the group were not able to get their cars out in time and by the end, a dozen vehicles had been lost beneath the ice.

Climate officials in Russia warned that fishing on frozen lakes or sea in the afternoon sun was 'highly dangerous' as the melting ice may not be able to take the weight of a person- let alone that of a vehicle.

Weather expert Dmitry Aksyonov said: 'This sort of thing happens every year.

'Those who go out onto frozen lakes at night are generally fine. But for those who are still there in the afternoon, as this group was, it is highly dangerous as the ice is melting.

'Although it might be able to hold a man, it certainly isn't strong enough for a two-tonne vehicle.' 

Many were not as lucky a Andrejew and were not able to save their vehicles in time to stop them going under

A total of 12 cars were lost during the incident after the ice on eastern Russia's Sea of Okhotsk began to melt

Weather experts warned these incidents were fairly common as the ice began melting in the afternoons creating 'highly dangerous' conditions
