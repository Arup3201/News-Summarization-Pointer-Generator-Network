Ed Miliband was accused of ‘economic vandalism’ yesterday after his shock proposal to fix energy prices wiped almost £2billion from the value of Britain’s two largest power firms.

The Labour leader faced a storm of criticism at his ‘insane’ plan to enforce price controls if he enters Downing Street.

A defiant Mr Miliband said it was possible that a government he led would also seek to control other markets, fuelling speculation that Labour might step in to regulate water, rail and petrol.

In a brutal backlash against his announcement, energy investors warned the 1970s-style policies would lead to economic shutdown.

Shares in British Gas owner Centrica and SSE – the only two ‘big six’ power giants on the London Stock Exchange – plunged by 5 per cent, wiping £1.9billion from their combined value.

More than 200 pensions and investment funds holding the life savings of millions of people across the UK are exposed to Centrica’s share price. 

And the giant company warned ‘it would not be economically viable to continue’ supplying energy in Britain if prices were capped while costs were rising.

Lord Mandelson, a former Business Secretary under Labour, last night criticised Mr Miliband’s demand for a resetting of the energy market. He said: ‘I believe that perceptions of Labour policy are in danger of being taken backwards.

'At the Business Department I tried to move on from the conventional choice in industrial policy between state control and laissez faire.'

Critics said Mr Miliband had the chance to change the industry when he was Energy Secretary before the last election, but chose not to.

Challenge: In an open letter to the ¿big six¿ energy companies, Mr Miliband said that the public had lost faith in them

Official figures show that the largest rise in energy prices since 1997 was during the years when Mr Miliband had the job.

A senior regulatory source said: ‘Miliband was presented with a plan in 2010, which aimed to secure the supply of affordable energy to British households – but he sat on it and did nothing.’ 

Centrica’s largest shareholder, Neil Woodford from Invesco, who controls the savings and pension investments of millions, fiercely attacked the Labour leader. He said: ‘This policy is economic vandalism at a time when this country needs all the help it can get.

It is insane. If Centrica and SSE cannot make any money supplying electricity to the retail market then they won’t supply it. The lights will go off, the economy will shut down.’

One former Labour government minister warned Mr Miliband’s ‘socialist’ policies would push unemployment beyond three million.

Digby Jones, who served as trade minister under Gordon Brown, said: ‘The sheer damage it will do to the economy does not bear thinking about. They are talking that this will be the end of the energy market – it’s far more dangerous.

'This is sheer, unbridled socialism. He is going to hijack the organs of management.’ 

The crossbench peer, a former head of business group the CBI, added: ‘I go around the world, banging the drum for Britain, trying to get companies to invest in Britain. Yesterday just made that a little more difficult. He is going to sacrifice Britain’s prosperity on the altar of social tribalism.’ 

Mr Miliband dismissed the idea that his party conference speech on Tuesday marked a shift to the Left, and rejected his ‘Red Ed’ nickname.

‘I’m One Nation Ed,’ he said. ‘I think what people are interested in is not labels, people are interested in how somebody’s going to tackle the problems in their life.’ 

Polls suggest that Mr Miliband’s confrontation with the energy firms could prove popular.

A recent YouGov poll found that 38 per cent of Britons trusted energy companies less than the year before, and 76 per cent wanted government to do more to reduce energy prices.

In an open letter to the ‘big six’ energy companies, Mr Miliband said that the public had lost faith in them: ‘There is a crisis of confidence. We face a stark choice. We can work together on the basis of this price freeze to make the market work in the future.

'Or you can reinforce in the public mind that you are part of the problem not the solution.’ 

Mr Miliband conceded it was possible firms might try to increase bills just before the proposed price freeze kicked in, but warned them that would be against the law.

Energy analyst Peter Atherton from Liberum Capital told the Daily Mail: ‘This is a clarion call to disinvest from the UK energy sector. It’s a screaming headline that people should rush to pull their money out of Britain.

‘That’s why, in the 25 years since privatisation, no-one has gone near energy price controls.’ 

The move is also likely to breach EU rules and could be slapped down as illegal, he claimed.

Tony Cocker, the chief executive of E.on, wrote to Mr Miliband to say ‘at a stroke’ bills could be greatly reduced by funding green levies through general taxation rather than loading them on to households.

The value of Centrica, owner of British Gas, and Scottish and Southern Energy fell by a combined £2billion in London trading

Ed Miliband’s attempt to fix energy prices has already had a devastating impact on the shares of Britain’s power giants.

The value of Centrica, owner of British Gas, and Scottish and Southern Energy fell by a combined £2billion in London trading.

This was no knee-jerk reaction. City analysts and investors believe that Mr Miliband has made a major blunder that could potentially damage energy investment between now and 2017 – the point at which his price freeze would be lifted.

Here are my predictions for what could be the fall-out from his declaration.

Markets require certainty of pricing to invest. As a result, major shareholders will not fund new energy projects if they do not believe that their spending will be profitable.

The UK faces a one-in-four chance of power cuts this winter, according to confidential calculations by the energy regulator Ofgem. Mr Miliband’s price freeze would make it  more likely that such outages would occur, as long-awaited investment in new storage facilities, particularly for gas, would be delayed.

Centrica and SSE, the only UK-owned power companies, have the largest number of mothballed gas-production facilities. With no guarantees that economic energy prices can be delivered, those plants are unlikely to be brought back into production as the Government had hoped.

The Government and EDF – the state-owned French company – are currently in intense negotiations over a guaranteed price for future nuclear energy output. The talks have reached a stalemate, as the Treasury has been reluctant to accept EDF’s demand for  £98 per kilowatt hour. Mr  Miliband’s intervention could make the negotiation of a future price even more difficult. Some believe it may cause EDF to pull back from one of the biggest investments ever planned for the UK.

The prospects of greater competition in the energy supply market will be crushed.  A number of new, smaller  competitors have recently entered the market, seeking  to undercut the bigger operators. There will be no prospect of that if prices are controlled by a new Labour government.

The immediate impact of Mr Miliband’s speech will be felt by every person in the country with a pension fund invested in the UK’s power firms.  Profits and dividends would have to be cut to deal with his proposed price controls; this would be particularly painful for the three million private investors in Centrica, who bought shares following the Tell Sid campaign in 1986.

A price freeze would also destroy faith in private-sector investment in our utility companies. It could have a disastrous effect on the upcoming share offering of the Royal Mail, if investors believe that an incoming Labour government would seek to impose new price controls on the postal service as well.

Ed Miliband may have declared war on energy price rises, but he was the minister who brought in crippling green taxes which greatly inflated fuel and power bills for every household.

Mr Miliband was Labour’s Energy Secretary between 2008 and 2010 when household energy bills rose at more than double the pace than they have done under the Coalition.

Mr Miliband pushed through the Climate Change Act in 2008, committing the UK to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.

He committed Britain to building thousands of wind farms and other costly green measures as he warned ‘there is no low-cost energy future’.

To pay for them, green ‘stealth taxes’ were added to household bills. 

Green levies now account for £110 or 11 per cent of the average £1,000 household energy bill. By 2020, the figure will rise to an average of £280.

Yesterday energy firms said a more ‘honest’ approach would be for the Government to pay for green measures out of general taxation.

Alistair Phillips-Davies, boss of Scottish and Southern Energy, said: ‘If Labour removed these stealth taxes from bills and paid for them through taxation, not only would it reduce bills, it would have the progressive effect of shifting the burden of paying from those who can’t afford to pay to those who can.’

Gas bills jumped nearly 28 per cent in 2008 and 2009, while the price of electricity rose more than 14 per cent.

The Office for National Statistics figures show gas bills rose about 13 per cent and electricity bills by just over 6 per cent in 2011 and 2012 – the first full two years of the current government.
