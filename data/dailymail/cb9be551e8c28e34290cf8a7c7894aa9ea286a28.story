A new housing boom could be on the way - with a relaxation of planning laws prompting a surge in the number of large housing estates being forced through by developers, a study claimed today.

England’s local authorities approved 195,000 planning applications over the past year, which is a 9 per cent rise on the average before legal changes came in promoting sustainable development.

Planning permission for large residential developments increased by a quarter from 4,000 in 2010/11 to 4,900 in 2013/14 – with a rise in the approval rate from 73 per cent to 77 per cent.

The figures come as a Conservative peer said hundreds of thousands of homes must be built on 800 square miles of British countryside where there are ‘big, open, flat fields of no agricultural merit’.

Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise said the Government must allow construction on greenfield areas - and added that he does not believe the country is already over-developed.

The 46-year-old chief executive of retailer Next said ‘beautiful countryside’ must be preserved, but the proportion of the UK that has been developed should be increased from 8 per cent to 9 per cent.

Lord Wolfson told The Daily Telegraph: ‘There is a lot of justifiable fear about development. People assume that there is very little countryside left which isn’t true.

‘When people say we need more land for
 homes they summon up the Cotswolds and South Downs in their 
imagination, and imagine it all ruined. And no-one wants that.

‘But equally there are lots of parts of 
the countryside where no one walks in – that are just big, open, flat 
fields of no agricultural merit.’

He claimed that an extra 300,000 homes would add 3 per cent to the UK’s gross domestic product.

BROWNFIELD SITES are found on derelict or disused land. They improve the appearance of these areas and are often found near towns or cities – so reduce the need for car use.

But they are more expensive to build on - because the land often must be cleared first - and are more available in the North and Midlands, despite the biggest housing demand being found in the South-East.

GREENFIELD SITES are
 areas on which nothing has been previously constructed. They are 
praised for being cheaper to build on, but also mean the destruction of parts of
the countryside and encourage road commuting.

Environmentalists also 
argue that they promote urban sprawl, which is the spread of an urban 
area into its surrounding countryside.

Lord Wolfson - who is married to George Osborne’s economic adviser Eleanor Shawcross - is seen as  an ally of the Chancellor, and his comments echo those of the Prime Minister last November.

Mr Cameron said at the time that rural voters opposed to new planning rules were killing off the chances of young people achieving the ‘dream of home ownership’.

The Prime Minister accused grassroots Conservatives and countryside groups that oppose building on greenfield land of putting their own interests before the country’s.

But a hard-hitting report two months ago claimed that rural towns and villages were being placed under siege by the threat of 700,000 new homes in the countryside.

Almost 200,000 of these are earmarked for supposedly protected Green Belt land thanks to the Government's changes to planning laws, the Campaign to Protect Rural England warned.

Its report revealed that just 84 local
 authorities – a quarter of those outside London – propose to prioritise
 building on brownfield sites.

Lord Wolfson’s Next has taken some of its
 540 UK stores out of town to industrial estates over the past decade.

In 2012 it was claimed that the company was the fifth top retail park 
tenant in the UK, measured by the total area occupied - behind B&Q, 
Homebase, Currys and Matalan.

The study on planning figures by construction industry analysts Glenigan published in the Telegraph comes following the launch of National Planning Policy Framework planning reforms.

Lord Wolfson

CPRE chief executive Shaun Spiers told MailOnline: ‘Lord Wolfson is a businessman who has come to hate the planning system because it stops him plonking big retail sheds in the countryside on the edge of towns.

‘Now he says he wants to preserve a few beauty spots, but he clearly has no sense of the richness of the “ordinary” countryside that people love so much. That’s a great pity, but he should not be allowed to impose his aesthetic limitations – or his disdain for farming – on the rest of us.

‘Of course the country needs many more homes, particularly affordable homes, and some of those will have to go on greenfield sites.

‘But let’s start by developing the thousands of brownfield sites now lying derelict across the country. That will not only save the countryside from being eaten away. It will also vastly improve our towns and cities, and make them better places to live.’
