The middle of July may normally see the sun shine and temperatures soar, but it seemed a long way from the height of summer today as heavy downpours hit Britain.

The prospect of a barbecue summer was put on hold nationwide over the weekend as forecasters warned the wet weather is likely to last into next week.

Heavy showers, thunder and windy conditions battered western and northern England, as well as the South-East, including The Open golf championship at Royal St George's in Kent.

Many families will hope that, with school holidays just a week away, Britain defies the ancient St Swithin's Day folklore promising rain for a further 40 days.

But the prospect of sunny spells looks uncertain as forecasters said the wind and rain is expected to last at least until Monday.

Further wet spells are expected well 
into next week across large parts of the country, with the Met Office 
saying some parts of the UK might not see settled sunnier spells until 
the last week of July.

After heavy showers hit the UK last 
weekend and again on St Swithin's Day yesterday, the old rhyme may have 
some truth to it after all.

The Met office were even forced to issue severe weather warnings for parts of Scotland due to the unprecedented downpours.

The Highlands, Grampian and central areas of Scotland were told to 'be aware' of severe wet weather both today and tomorrow.

Elsewhere, the world's best golfers did battle with the elements on the third day of the Open championship in Sandwich, Kent.

The
likes of Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke were made to contend with 
driving rain and 30mph winds lashing the course from the Kent coastline.

Forecasters
had predicted autumnal conditions well into the start of next week, 
with up to an inch of rain today and gusts of up to 50mph.

The wet and wild weekend follows a mixed first half of July for much of the country, and a decidedly average June.

Met
Office spokesman Dan Williams said: 'By Sunday, it will be very 
unsettled with showers and longer spells of rain affecting most areas. 
There will be strong winds and blustery conditions, particularly near 
southern and western coasts, which could cause problems.

'Temperatures
will be lower than average for the time of year – around the mid-teens 
–  and with the wind and rain it will feel chilly for July.'

Winds
could be strong enough to cause damage to trees over the weekend, with 
speeds of up to 46mph – bordering force nine of 12 on the Beaufort 
scale.
