The beautiful 25-year-old from Connecticut who was last night crowned Miss USA is not just a pretty face it seems as it was revealed today that she is an accountant.

Erin Brady beat out 51 other beauty queens from across the country when she was announced as the winner of the beauty pageant at Planet Hollywood hotel-casino in Las Vegas.

And she said she was looking forward to telling her bosses at Prudnetial Financial that she would not be coming in today - or ever again.

The Central Connecticut State University finance major wore an elegant white and gold gown as she was given her crown by last year's winner Miss Maryland, Nana Meriwether.

Modelling days: It is Erin's goal to help break the cycle of addiction as she plans to be an advocate for children of alcohol and substance abuse

Childhood: Erin was raised in a home heavily influenced by alcohol and substance abuse and she sadly remembers the lack of support and places to turn to for the children of addicts, such as her

Siblings: Her father Francis said he always knew his math-oriented daughter was a glamour girl. She and her sisters used to strut around and pretend they were beauty queens

Earlier, judge and personality Mo Rocca said he was looking for a winner who reminded him of Abraham Lincoln 'without the beard'.

Brady impressed the judges by answering a question about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold 
widespread DNA tests. Asked if she agreed with the decision, Brady said 
she did.

But her fellow contestant Miss Utah, Marissa Powell did not fare so well when asked she was posed a question by a panelist - her amusing response has now gone viral.

She was asked: 'A recent report shows
that in 40 per cent of American families with children, women are the 
primary earners yet they continue to earn less than men. What does this 
say about society?"

Miss Powell nodded, paused and then 
responded:'I think we can relate this back to education, and how we are 
continuing to try to strive … to … figure out how to create jobs right 
now. That is the biggest problem right now.

'I think, especially the men are … um … seen as the leaders of this, and
so we need to see how to … create education better. So that we can 
solve this problem. Thank you.'

Younger days: Erin Brady is a graduate of Central Connecticut State University with a degree in Finance and a minor in Criminal Justice

Job: Erin is a Financial Accountant for Prudential Retirement in Hartford, CT, where she works behind the scenes by running the controls that ensure every member of her team has performed their work correctly and efficiently

Child's play: Erin plans to pursue an MBA in the near future and hopes to get involved with Pension Risk Transfers

Brady gets the crown 
and a New York apartment for one year. She is expected to spend her 
title reign on a nationwide speaking tour and raising breast and ovarian
cancer awareness, the organization's official cause.

She
beat Miss Louisiana, Miss Texas and Miss Illinois and contestants from 
South Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Utah, Alabama, North Carolina and Nevada, who got down to the final round.

As
the stage emptied, Brady spoke about her commitment to fighting drug 
and alcohol abuse, which have marked her family, and her excitement at 
the prospect of telling her bosses at Prudential Financial she wasn't 
coming in tomorrow. Or ever again.

'They're going to be very upset to learn that I'm not coming,' she said.

Asked
what she was looking forward to, now that the competition is over, she 
described a routine that sounded not very different from her training 
regime: getting in her beauty sleep and hitting the gym.

Her father Francis said he always 
knew his math-oriented daughter was a glamour girl. She and her sisters 
used to strut around and pretend they were beauty queens.

'My grandmother used to have a video 
camera and she's tell us to walk around the pool like Miss America,' 
Brady's sister Lauren said.

In
a twist, organizers announced they would allow fans to save one of the 
eliminated women by announcing their support on Twitter.

During
the swimsuit competition, the ladies threw off sheer wraps to reveal 
skimpy blue, gold and orange bikinis. They strutted in stilettos to the 
Jonas Brothers' live performance of 'Pom Poms.'

The women also strutted to Calvin 
Harris' electronica-infused 'Sweet Nothing' in an array of spangled, 
flowing evening gowns. Trains, gauze and long wavy hair were the 
preferred looks.

Unlike the rival Miss America pageant, Miss USA doesn't ask its queens to perform a talent or choose a charity mission.

The judge's panel included over-the-top fashion designer Betsey Johnson, 'Biggest Loser' star Bob Harper and Rocca.

Rocca praised the pageant as a prime example of Americana backstage.

The
pageant aired live on NBC, hosted by Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers 
pop act and Giuliana Rancic, co-anchor of 'E! News.' The Jonas Brothers 
and DJ Pauly D were expected to perform.

The winner will represent the United States at the Miss Universe pageant in the winter.

Last year's Miss USA, Olivia Culpo, 
won that international crown, becoming the first Miss USA to ascend to 
Miss Universe in 16 years. Meriwether, who had been first runner-up, 
took over for her for the remainder of the year.

The Miss USA hopefuls stayed at the 
Planet Hollywood casino for the past week, but the flashing slot 
machines and ubiquitous oversized novelty drinks have been little more 
than a background to a stuffed schedule of product tie-in media events, 
including hairdo contests and paddleboat competitions.

The
animal rights organization People For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals 
is using the pageant to stage a protest of fur and the tradition of 
awarding furs to winners of some state pageants.

PETA
has made a provocative ad featuring four nude former Miss USA winners. 
The tagline is: 'Feel Beautiful in Your Own Skin, and Let Animals Keep 
Theirs.'
