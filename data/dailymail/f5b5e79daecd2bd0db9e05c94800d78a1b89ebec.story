Some manufacturers are charging more than a 1,000 per cent markup for extra storage on tablet computers, according to a Which? investigation.

A 16GB iPad Air, for example, costs £399 while a 32GB iPad Air costs £479 – a difference of £80 for 16GB of extra storage. 

This is despite the fact the market price for 16GB of additional memory is only £5.95, the watchdog claims.

Which? Magazine compared the prices companies including Apple and Google charge for a 16GB tablet, compared to the same model with 32GB of storage. Apple was found to charge £80 for the extra storage on its new iPad Air, pictured, even though the market price for the same amount of storage is just £5.95

The report comes just weeks after figures from analytics firm IHS found Apple makes £225 profit on every iPad Air it sells. 

The Colorado-based firm took the tablet to pieces and worked out how much each individual component would cost to manufacture.

It discovered the cheapest 16GB Wi-Fi-only iPad Air costs
$274 to make, based on preliminary results, yet sells for $499.

IHS’ Teardown Analysis Service only looked at the price in
dollars.

If the figures are converted to UK prices this works out at £170
production costs compared to a retail price of £399.

This works out at a markup of 129 per cent.

Google charges an extra £50 to increase the memory on its Nexus 10 from 16GB to 32GB, while Amazon charges £40 for the same storage increase on its Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.

Which? described the markups as ‘outrageous’ and advised potential customers to buy a tablet with an SD or microSD slot and add a memory card for a fraction of the cost.

The report said: ‘The best thing about using a tablet is filling it with apps, songs and videos that you love. But all of this content gobbles up storage space fast, and tablets use flash memory that's limited in size.

‘Unlike with PCs, tablet storage is difficult to upgrade after you've purchased your model. That's because most tablet bodies are sealed and don't let you install further hardware.’

Which? also added the true amount of storage space is not the same as advertised because operating systems and built-in apps take up space.

It found just 10GB of free space was left available for the customer's songs, apps and photos on a 16GB Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, for example.

Google charges an extra £50 for a 32GB model of its Nexus 10, pictured, compared to the smaller 16GB version. There is also a £40 difference between the 16GB and 32GB models of its Nexus 7

Ben Miles of Chillbast, a UK-based computer manufacturer which buys its flash memory from some of the same suppliers who make the flash storage components found in tablets, told Which?: ‘16GB of flash memory is mind-numbingly cheap now.

Which? also found full storage space is rarely what's advertised. For example, there is only 10GB free space on a 16GB Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, pictured

‘As a general rule, for manufacturers like ourselves, flash costs less than 40p per GB, so for companies to charge so much for an extra 16GB seems scandalous.

‘The difference in cost between manufacturing a product with 16GB and 32GB of memory would probably equate to less than $10 (£6).’

Which? editor Richard Headland added: ‘With tablets in demand this Christmas, buyers will be shocked to discover what a raw deal they're getting on built-in memory.'

Apple and Google declined to comment on the Which? report, while Samsung told Which?: ‘It is Samsung policy to provide the most reasonable market price to customers.’
