The BBC has been accused of ‘exploitation’ after it allowed an apparently drunk Charles Kennedy to take part in Question Time.

The former Liberal Democrat leader, who has a history of problems with alcohol, slurred during the discussion show on Thursday and appeared to be struggling to follow the arguments of other guests on the panel.

He gave confused and disjointed answers, misinterpreted comments from fellow panellists and wagged his finger.

Mr Kennedy resigned as party leader in 2006 after losing the support of MPs in the wake of his public admission that he had a drink problem.

Viewers criticised the BBC after Charles Kennedy gave confusing answers to some questions he was asked

The former Lib Dem leader, who is a recovering alcoholic, represented his party on the show last night

Mr Kennedy, MP for home seat of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, was on the panel last night alongside Conservative minister Anna Soubry, Labour's Lucy Powell MP, Green leader Natalie Bennett and Private Eye editor Ian Hislop for the debate filmed in Leeds. 

He spoke about defence spending, predicted a minority government after the election and gave his views on intelligence gathering on terror suspects.

He later shared an anecdote about Jeremy Clarkson throwing a Biro at Ian Hislop, saying: 'I was there. It's true. I saw Mr Hislop give forth blood.'

Asked what he thought of Clarkson's suspension, he said: 'Jeremy Clarkson, the future, this is very politically incorrect of me, but, end of Gone With The Wind, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.'

It is understood Mr Kennedy agreed to appear on the programme after being approached by the BBC directly and was not put forward as a spokesman by Lib Dem HQ.

A Lib Dem source said: ‘It was quite clear that he was not his usual self last night.’

Many of those watching the show took to Twitter to suggest he was a poor choice of panellist by the programme's makers. 

The children’s writer and poet Michael Rosen said: ‘I don’t think the BBC is safeguarding the safety of Charles Kennedy.’ 

Davey Stewart tweeted: 'Charles Kennedy on #bbcqt was very uncomfortable viewing. A visibly broken soul! Shame on #BBC for allowing him onto the panel #DutyOfCare'

A website user called fenwench added: 'Charles Kennedy has admitted to alcoholism. It was very clear to 1000s watching tonight that his fight is ongoing. BBC should be ashamed.'

And Robert Richard wrote: 'Irresponsible of the BBC to let Charles Kennedy on in that state. Hope the man finds the help, care, and peace which he needs.'

John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the BBC had taken advantage of Mr Kennedy.

‘The BBC has been exploitative here,’ he added. ‘What is the duty of care of the broadcaster to the people who appear on television? Is it to exploit them? The BBC doesn’t seem to be setting out to inform people, but to entertain people.

‘My question is whether they provided booze in the green room [where TV guests sit before appearances].’ 

The appearance prompted concern among viewers as well as criticism of the BBC for inviting him to speak

Other Twitter users rounded of those appearing to make fun of Mr Kennedy.

Former footballer Stan Collymore tweeted: 'Seeing a lot of mocking towards Charles Kennedy. A good man who needs a little help. Like many people do now and again.'

And Sarah Raad added: I don't know if Charles Kennedy is drunk or not but I wish some tweeters would have some bloody humanity & stop being so spiteful. #bbcqt'

Mr Kennedy became the youngest sitting member of parliament when he won the Scottish seat of Ross, Cromarty and Skye at the age of 23.

He has been an MP ever since and is currently battling for re-election, though one poll has suggested he could lose his 37% majority to the SNP in the May General Election.

He has recently campaigned on issues of fuel poverty and spoken in support of taxes on banks and is currently visiting schools in his constituency to encourage youngsters to take an interest in politics.

Mr Kennedy was Lib Dem leader from 1999 to 2006, when a leadership contest was called after he admitted battling drink.

It came after he was questioned about his drinking habits by Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman in 2002.

Speaking in 2006, he said: 'Over the past 18 months I've been coming to terms with and seeking to cope with a drink problem, and I've come to learn through that process that a drink problem is a serious problem indeed.

'It's serious for yourself and it's serious for those around you. I've sought professional help and I believe today that this issue is essentially resolved.'

In March 2008 he was due to take part in Radio 4’s Any Questions but missed a train from London’s Euston Station, again raising questions over his health. 

In 2010, he split from his wife Sarah after eight years. The couple have a son together who is called Donald.

Mr Kennedy's office have yet to comment on the appearance. The BBC declined to comment.

A source close to the show said the green room was usually stocked with wine and beer, but that Mr Kennedy arrived late for his appearance, suggesting he might not have had time to drink. The reason for his late arrival is not known.

Last Thursday was not the first time Mr Kennedy has appeared drunk on TV. A BBC source said he had a reputation for doing a good job even when the worse for wear, although this was not in evidence on Question Time.

Charles Kennedy: 'Did I miss something here? Did the Defence Secretary say that it was a terrible mistake that the House of Commons did not vote to invade Syria?'

Anna Soubry: 'No I didn't say that. I said it was a terrible mistake that we didn't keep our options open.'

David Dimbleby: 'What about the issue raised in the question of committing to a real terms increase in defence spending?'

Charles Kennedy: 'I'm sorry?'

David Dimbleby: 'What about the issue of committing to a real terms increase in defence spending?'

Charles Kennedy: 'I'm committed to two per cent.'

Asked about a potential coalition between Labout and the SNP...

Charles Kennedy: 'Do you know folks I don't know where to begin. I'm speaking as a Scot. Erm, the er, and I've heard an awful lot of claptrap in the last few minutes, it has to be said. The question was would the Labour Party go into... what were the words exactly?'

After Ian Hislop told how Jeremy Clarkson threw a pen at him...

Charles Kennedy: 'I was there. It's a true story, I saw Mr Hislop give forth blood.'

David Dimbleby: 'Charles Kennedy, in or out for Clarkson?'

Charles Kennedy: 'In or out? Jeremy Clarkson, the future, this is very politically incorrect of me, but, end of Gone With The Wind, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.'
