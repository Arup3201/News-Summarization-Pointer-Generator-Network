Quaffing cocktails at beach houses and an Ivy League education - it is a lifestyle that seems at odds with someone capable of unleashing foul-mouthed tweets on British politicians.

A day after sticking up two fingers at the British establishment, images reveal the charmed life of Nell Diamond, the Princeton-educated daughter of disgraced Barclays Bank chief Bob Diamond.

Images capture the 23-year-old cosying up to award-winning New York designer Prabal Gurung, whose creations are adored by celebrities including Michelle Obama and Lady Gaga.

Other photographs show Nell, who enjoyed a privileged upbringing in British schools and now works for Deutsche Bank on Wall Street, parading designer dresses at Fashion Week or charity events.

She is also captured laughing with The Chew presenter Daphne Oz, the daughter of Doctor Oz, and enjoying gin and tonics in the sun on breaks to Nantucket with friends.

In another photograph, she is shown vacationing in Aspen, Colorado and standing outside the five-star Little Nell hotel, where rooms cost between $650 and $4,000 a night.

But despite this apparent hard partying lifestyle, friends told MailOnline Nell does not drink and she spent more time in the library during her university years than in bars.

This work ethic has continued in her job as an analyst for Deutsche Bank, where she works 14-hour days and briefly attends social events before returning home to bed, friends said.

They added that she is humble about where she came from as she recognises her father, who earned millions each year as Barclays chief, did not have much money in his younger years.

One friend said she is not talking about her father's recent resignation and, even though they are close, she will not be rushing to his side. Instead, she has the outlook that 'life goes on'.

Nell has
stayed in touch with university friends, and shares a rented apartment 
with them in Manhattan.

She studied at the $25,000-a-year Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, before going
to Princeton, where she was president of the Pi 
Phi sorority.

The Deutsche Bank analyst is also a 
campaigner for Unicef and was named by website Business Insider as one 
of 'Wall Street’s Hottest Offspring'.

This privileged education and 
high-flying career - as well as her well-preened appearance - are at 
odds with the foul-mouthed remarks she made on Twitter on Tuesday.

Nell jumped to the defense of her father Bob Diamond after he quit his $8 million-a-year role over the Libor interest rate fixing scandal.

She took to Twitter to tell British politicians George Osborne and Ed Miliband to 'go ahead and #HMD' - an abbreviation for 'hold my d***'.

Just moments later, Nell thought better of the tweet and deleted it.

Instead, she wrote: 'No one in the world I admire more than my dad. 16yrs building 
Barclays. Shame to see the mistakes of few tarnish the hard work of so 
many.'

Miss Diamond did not respond to MailOnline's requests for a comment.

Amid pictures of designer shoes and fashion shows on Nell's own Twitter account, other images hint at her close relationship with her father.

In November last year she tweeted a 
picture of them together at a Jay-Z concert making his famous 'diamond' 
hand gesture - actually a symbol for his Roc-A-Fella Records company.

Her tweets came after Mr Diamond fell on his sword amid intense pressure from on the bank to force 
him out, it was claimed.

As he announced his resignation, Mr Diamond said he was standing down because: 'The external pressure placed on Barclays has reached a level that risks damaging the franchise.'

Mr
Diamond was grilled in the Commons by the Treasury Select Committee on 
Wednesday and his resignation a day earlier left him free to speak 
openly about what went on at the bank.

He apologised as he admitted there 
had 'clearly been mistakes' and 'reprehensible behaviour' at the bank, 
while adding that he had stepped down to prevent anymore damage to the 
bank.

But he declared 'I love 
Barclays', and added: 'History will judge Barclays as an incredible 
institution because of its people. We need to get through this and best 
way was for me to step down.'

The millionaire banker, 61, came 
under pressure from visibly angry MPs as he swerved questions, 
repeatedly saying that it had been 'wrong' for a 'handful' of traders to
fix the rate at which Barclays borrowed from other banks - potentially 
affecting millions of homeowners.

All a Twitter: She took down her offensive tweet minutes after posting it, but not before it was retweeted by Times journalist David Rose

Sense of humour: She also retweeted cutting messages about her father Bob Diamond

Mr Diamond admitted his shame over 
damming emails between staff who were fixing the interest rate.

In one, a trader 
at a different bank wrote to 'Trader G' at Barclays: 'Dude. I owe you 
big time! Come over one day after work and I’m opening a bottle of 
Bollinger.'

Mr Diamond said he was ‘physically ill’ when he read emails.

Other emails revealed how they would 
‘shout’ across the desk at each other to ‘beg’ for the interest rate to 
be fixed at a certain level in the hope of making millions for 
themselves.

Another said: ‘Coffees will be coming
your way either way, just to say thank you for your help in the past 
few weeks.’ His colleague replied: ‘Done...for you big boy.’

Mr Diamond said: ‘That behaviour was 
reprehensible, it was wrong. I’m sorry, I’m disappointed and I’m also 
angry. There is absolutely no excuse for this type of behaviour.'

But he pointed the finger at '14
or 15' other banks - including government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland,
Lloyds and Halifax Bank of Scotland - suggesting that they were lying 
about their rates.

Mr Diamond is said to be furious that
he and the bank have been blamed for ‘lowballing’ the rates at which 
Barclays said it could borrow from rivals.

Bankers insist the authorities knew 
these rates were inaccurate but did not act because they feared the 
truth would destabilise the markets. It is also claimed that regulators 
possessed evidence of rate-fixing.

Mr Diamond is in line to pocket 13.2million shares worth $35 million - which he 
is entitled to because he has served for more than 15 years - as part of
a golden pay off.

Barclays said the terms of Mr Diamond's severance package are 'still under discussion'.

Shareholders will reportedly attempt 
to force the banker to surrender $30 million worth of unvested shares 
awarded to him in previous years.

However, he will receive a minimum of at least a year's salary worth $2.1 million.

Mr Diamond, who joined the 
bank 16 years ago, said in his resignation statement: 'I am deeply
disappointed that the impression created by the events announced last 
week about what Barclays and its people stand for could not be further 
from the truth.'

'My motivation has always been to do what I 
believed to be in the best interests of Barclays. No decision over that 
period was as hard as the one that I make now to stand down as chief 
executive.'

He went on: 'I know that each and 
every one of the people at Barclays works hard every day to serve our 
customers and clients. That is how we support economic growth and the 
communities in which we live and work.'

He
added: 'I leave behind an extraordinarily talented management team that
I know is well placed to help the business emerge from this difficult 
period as one of the leaders in the global banking industry.'

George Osborne said Mr 
Diamond's resignation was 'the right decision for Barclays' and the 
'right decision for the country'.
