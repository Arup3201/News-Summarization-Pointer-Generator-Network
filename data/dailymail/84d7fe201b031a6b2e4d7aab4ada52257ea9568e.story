She is one of Britain's best ambassadors when it comes to style. And on the nine-day tour of Asia and the South Pacific that came to a glorious end last night, the Duchess of Cambridge frequently flew the flag for her nation's fashion.

The 30-year-old Duchess wore predominantly British designs, with Jaeger, Alexander McQueen, Jonathan Saunders and Zara featuring in her tour wardrobe, as well as one piece by little known Nepalese designer Prabal Gurung.

And for the grand finale, Kate chose a floral silk dress by British-based Project D London, a label set up by friends Tabitha Somerset Webb and Dannii Minogue.

Given the care Kate devotes to 
ensuring the labels she chooses are appropriate for the occasion, it is 
fitting that she chose Project D London - a brand owned by a Brit and an 
Australian - for the last leg of her tour and the journey by plane from Tuvalu to Brisbane.

The brand, which launched in 2010, was the result of a chance conversation between the two fashion lovers.

'It
all started with one of our girlie chats by the River Thames about our 
dreams and aspirations,' the two say on their website.

'Within
minutes we knew the time was right for us to start a fashion label 
together, so later that night over a bottle of wine we sketched our 
favourite dresses and shared our passion for style icons of old.

'We
realised that with our combined enthusiasm, we could create something 
unique and new that we loved.

'We decided to create a label that produced
gracefully feminine and effortlessly wearable dresses that followed the
curves of women’s bodies.

'That
day, Project D London was born. Since our first designs went on sale, 
we’ve been working on creating collections that make women – look and 
feel – amazing.'

Kate is not the only one of her 
circle to wear Project D - her sister Pippa Middleton chose a beautiful 
swallow print dress for a day in the Royal Box at Wimbledon in June 
earlier this year. 

Tabitha and Dannii declined to comment, but friends say the two are privately delighted that the elegant Duchess chose one of their designs on the tour.

 When she made an appearance int he Royal Box at Wimbledon in June, Pippa chose a printed silk dress by Project D.

Lauren Stevenson, PR Director at My-Wardrobe.com,
which stocks the line, said at the time she believes the reason the dresses are so popular 
is because they strike the right balance of cool and sophisticated.

'It's a classic case of women 
designing for women, with Dannii and Tabitha focusing on the silhouette 
and feminine detailing,' she said.

'The
youthful elegance of Project D's dresses are perfect for choice the 
young Royals... They hit the right note of glamorous sophistication.'
