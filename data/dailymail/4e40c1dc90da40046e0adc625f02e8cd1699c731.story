Living in a pub, you might expect being woken up by frantic bangs on the front door to mean that there is someone in need of emergency food and drink.

However, Lorna Brown, daughter of the landlord of the Grove Arms in Ludwell, Wiltshire, had a different kind of situation on her hands when she heard someone thumping on the door.

The 20-year-old trainee paramedic had just finished a night shift and was drifting off at 8.15am on Friday when prison officer Graham Bashford, 58, pulled up outside the pub.

His daughter, Hayley Jayes, 29, had just gone into labour and he was on his way to the hospital.

However, 10 miles into the 30-mile 
journey, Miss Jayes told him that she could not go any further so her 
father stopped outside the 500-year-old pub to get help.

Just 25 minutes after stopping, mother-of-two Miss Jayes gave birth to Jasmine who weighed 7lb 7oz.

The proud new mother, from Gillingham, Dorset, said: 'She was fabulous, great. I do not know what I would have done without her. We are both fine.Â 

'I did not expect to give birth in the front seat of my dad's car but I had no choice. I could not reach the hospital.'

Miss Brown, a student paramedic for the South
Western Ambulance Service, added: '[I was] just in my pyjamas. I dashed 
downstairs and ran five feet to the car outside the pub.

'I was woken at 8.15am and the baby was born at 8.40am. I was 25-minutes with mum before the baby was born.'

Ten minutes later an ambulance turned up and Hayley and Jasmine were rushed to Salisbury District Hospital in Wiltshire.

Lorna has just finished studying obstetrics and gynaecology.

Her father and licensee Ben Brown ,49, described how desperate Graham turned up on the doorstep saying 'I need an ambulance my daughter is giving birth now outside your pub'.

Ben said: 'He had pulled up outside at 8.15am in the morning in a blind panic.

'But my daughter came to the rescue - luckily she had just finished doing gynaecology. She was primed beautifully for the occasion.'
