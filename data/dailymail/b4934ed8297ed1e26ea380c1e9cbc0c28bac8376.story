The Government today gave the green-light to its first controversial new toll road since David Cameron announced his radical  pay-as-you-drive policy in Spring.

But it sparked an immediate row as motoring groups said it marked a U-turn by allowing tolling on existing roads – not just on those which were new or enhanced.

Drivers will have to pay to use a 20-mile section of the main A14 through Cambridgeshire which will form part of a major investment in highways in eastern England.

Although no charges have yet been set, drivers could expect to pay between £3 and £5 for the privilege.

It is the first tolling announcement since Prime Minister Cameron revealed in March a 'radical' plan to kick-start the economy by allowing private firms and investment fund companies to compete to build, operate and maintain the major motorways and trunk roads in England and Wales, noting: 'There's nothing green about a traffic jam - and gridlock holds the economy back.'

He said radical solutions were needed to unblock Britain's gridlocked roads  at a time  when 'frankly, there isn't enough money'.

He added: 'Road tolling is one option - but we are only considering this for new, not existing, capacity.'

Motorists would not pay tolls to use existing roads, he insisted at the time.

However, experts say today's announcement suggests a significant policy shift as the Transport Department said entire stretches of existing roads which are 'enhanced' can now be tolled – not just the extra lanes which are added, often dubbed 'Lexus lanes'.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said the tolling was an 'imaginative solution' to beating congestion.

Critics say it is privatisation by the back door.

The A14 corridor scheme in Cambridgeshire has been added to the Department for Transport's major projects programme and work could start by 2018.

Funding for the improvements could be generated in part through tolling a length of the enhanced A14, featuring 20 miles of new or widened road.

But more work would be done 'to determine the best tolling solution, including what length the tolled section should be, how users would pay and what the tariff should be'.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation and a supporter said: 'Today's announcement is significant.

'Ministers have gone further than before by opening the possibility for tolling existing roads and not just brand new capacity - in this case a widened section of the A14, a critical international trade route.

'Faced with the necessity to generate new funds for infrastructure this news demonstrates that Government is being innovative in its thinking.

'We would hope that work on enhancing the A14 starts sooner rather than later and certainly before 2018.'

He added: 'Under this plan parts of the A14 will be enhanced, widened and tolled in their entirety. This is new and goes further than was mentioned previously.'

Edmund King, the AA's president, condemned the change. He said: 'The worry is that essential traffic will divert off the toll route and clog up local routes leading to more congestion, pollution and accidents.'

The Department for Transport said: 'Two new roads would be built in parallel to, with one on each side of, the current A14 immediately north of Cambridge for local use.

'Meanwhile, the existing A14 carriageway will be upgraded through the removal of accesses and junctions, and improvements to junctions at the northern and southern ends. '

The Department added: 'Study work has 
confirmed that funding for these can be generated in part through 
tolling a length of the enhanced A14, featuring around 20 miles of new 
or widened road.

'However, 
more work will be taken to determine the best tolling solution, 
including what length the tolled section should be, how users would pay 
and what the tariff should be.'

Plan: The A14 corridor scheme in Cambridgeshire has been added to the Department for Transport's major projects programme and work could start by 2018

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said: 'The A14 is a crucial strategic route for the east of England, vital not only for international road traffic using the port of Felixstowe but everyone who relies on it daily.

'This is why my department has been working hard to generate innovative and imaginative solutions to tackling long term congestion.'

Labour said the tolls on existing  
parts of the A14 was a significant policy u-turn and could open the way 
for 'a tolling free for all' on the nation's roads.

John Woodcock MP, Labour's Shadow 
Transport Minister, said: 'Tolling existing roads is another broken 
promise to motorists who are being squeezed like never before by this 
out of touch Government. Ministers need to spell out how many road users
will be caught by the new tolls they are set to impose on existing 
roads.'

The AA said it welcomed the decision to improve capacity in the area but felt that 20 miles of tolls could backfire as a road to nowhere for Britain's 35 million drivers.

An AA/Populus poll in 2011 found that 58 per cent opposed the tolling of new roads (39per cent were strongly opposed). While improved local roads alongside the A14 would be welcome they would risk becoming clogged with drivers diverting to avoid the tolls, the AA said.
