A 20-year-old Georgia woman has died 
from an apparent asthma attack, and according to sheriff’s deputies, her
friends did nothing to help beyond dumping her body on the side of a 
road.

Taylor Smith was found dead in Jasper near a vacant mobile home just down the road from the county jail.

One man has since been jailed in connection to the case, and three others are facing possible charges.

Tragic: The body of Taylor Smith (right), 20, pictured here with her mother, was dumped
by her friends on the side of a road after she had died from an 
apparent asthma attack

According to investigators, Smith was spending time with some friends over the weekend when she suffered an asthma attack, the station WSB-TV reported.

Instead of seeking medical help for the 20-year-old, Pickens County sheriff’s officials say the people she was with attempted to revive her with a cold shower and the next morning dumped her lifeless body off Robin Lane.

Someone, however, had dialled 911, which allowed the Georgia Bureau of investigations to track down the suspects.

Marty Gaddis, 38, has been arrested and charged with concealing a death, abandonment of a body and tampering with evidence. He also faces drug and reckless conduct counts.

'As a mother, I'm angry. I'm so angry that they treated her the way they did,' said Tanya Smith, Taylor's mother.

Mrs Smith, who serves as a lieutenant 
with the Holly Springs Police Department, told the station that her 
daughter, a former cheerleader at Creekside High School, had wanted to 
experience ‘everything’ before settling into a 'normal life.'   

Taylor
had suffered from asthma her entire life, and her grieving mother said 
that had her friends truly cared about her, they could have saved her by
taking her to a hospital or calling 911.

'She
didn't deserve just to be dumped on the side of the road, just because 
they didn't know what else to do,' Tanya Smith said.

Furious and heartbroken: Taylor's mother, police officer Tanya Smith, wants her daughter's so-called friends to pay for failing to seek medical attention for the 20-year-old 

Devastated: Tanya Smith never got the chance to say goodbye to her daughter (pictured), who she said did not deserve to be dumped outside

She added, ‘it a precious thing to get to say goodbye and I hate that that was taken from me.’Now, Tanya Smith wants her late daughter's so-called friends to pay for their callous behavior.

Authorities expect to make additional arrests in connection to Smith's death. Online records indicate that Marty Gaddis has a criminal record, which includes a 1998 arrest on a charge of misdemeanour riot.
