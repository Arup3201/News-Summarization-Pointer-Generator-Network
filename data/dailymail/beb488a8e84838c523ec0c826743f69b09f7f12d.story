The mother of a three-year-old boy killed by a hit-and-run driver after wandering into the road have made a desperate plea for the driver to come forward.

Kayren Wake was walking with her son Danny Wake in Darlington, County Durham, when he strayed into the road and was knocked over. Danny had been on his way home from picking up an Argos catalogue, which he was going to choose his Christmas presents from.

A 24-year-old local man was initially arrested but later released without charge.

Today Ms Wake and other members of Danny's family made an emotional appeal at a news conference in Durham, where they paid tribute to their 'beautiful little angel'. They asked witnesses to come forward to give them 'find the answers we need'.

A statement on behalf of Ms Winter, Danny's uncle Scott Sherlock, and the boy's father, who is also called Danny Wake, said: 'Words cannot describe how we as a family are feeling since the loss of our beautiful little angel Danny.'

'Since Monday morning we can only describe our lives as a living nightmare as we struggle to come to terms with the thought of never seeing our boy again.

'The best way we can describe Danny is as a fun-loving, happy little boy with an incredibly cheeky little smile.

'He was loved by so many and really was the light of our lives.'

'Instead of looking forward to planning 
our Christmas as a family we are now facing the devastating task of 
planning Dannyâ€™s funeral. We desperately need to know how and why this 
has happened.

'Our family want to appeal to the person who did this or who knows who did this to find it in their hearts to come forward so we can find the answers we need.

'Imagine if this was your little boy and how you would be feeling. With this is mind please contact police urgently.'

Police had previously released CCTV footage of the moments Danny and his family were walking along the street in Darlington, directly before the fatal collision.

In the images, 
Danny is shown trailing behind his mother who is wheeling a pushchair 
with a girl closer behind.

The little boy, in a hat and thick green coat, is shown walking happily in the sunshine moments before the tragedy.

They also issued images of passengers getting off a nearby bus, hoping to trace additional witnesses to the crash.

Officers said they had received an 'excellent' response from local people so far, and are revealing large amounts of evidence submitted since the incident, which is believed to have been 'a terrible, terrible accident.'

Chief Inspector Ed Turner, of Durham Constabulary, said: 'This is a unique and isolated incident and when we have to deal with them they are very tragic and very difficult for the family to come to terms with.

Christmas shopping: Danny, who is seen with his back to the bus camera, had been returning home from a trip to the shops to pick up a catalogue to choose Christmas presents when the tragic incident happened

Investigation: A local man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after the crash but police now believe he is unconnected with the incident

''It's quite a complicated incident and 
we have put out an appeal for anybody that was driving a vehicle on 
Neasham Road and Falmer Road on Monday morning.

Detective Superintendent Kevin Weir, who is leading the investigation, added: 'We have reason to believe a 
Mercedes Sprinter style van light in colour was in the Farmer Road area 
at about 10.35 on Monday morning.

'This van is being described as having distinct red markings which could perhaps be a logo.

'We are really keen to speak with the
driver of this vehicle as they may have important information to assist
us with our enquries.'
