The iconic Louvre in Paris was forced to close its doors to the public today after staff staged a walk out in protest at the increasing number of pickpocket thefts by Romanian immigrant children at the museum.

Hundreds of staff refused to work because of the increasing number of thieves targeting tourists at the city's famous landmark, which normally attracts up to 30,000 visitors a day.

Many of the thieves are said to be the children of Romanian immigrants who get into the museum for free and then start asking tourists for money.

They usually ask their victims whether they speak English before surrounding them and taking money and other possessions.

Although the problem of pickpocketing is said to be a widespread problem throughout the city, the Louvre seems to have become a particularly popular target for thieves.

The museum had asked for extra help from the police at the end of last year, but the problem has persisted.

One member of staff, who did not wish to be named, said: 'The children are tough and very well organised.

'They stop at nothing to get what they want, and work in gangs.

'We can only do so much, but arrests are usually impossible because of their young age.

'If they are kicked out, they return the next day. They are very aggressive towards staff, putting people in danger of attack.'

Members of museum staff trade unions visited the Ministry of Culture following today's walk-out to demand action.

Two years ago, France's then Interior Minister said that the vast majority of street robberies in Paris were being carried out by the children of Romanian immigrants.

Claude Gueant said the notoriously poor and corrupt eastern European state was responsible for exporting some of the most notorious sneak thieves in the world.

Many operated in gangs around the Gare du Nord Eurostar station, preying on British travellers as they arrived by high-speed train from London.

France has shut down illegal Roma camps full of Romanian immigrants which have sprung up around the French capital, but Romanian crime remains a huge problem.

Romania joined the EU in 2007 but faced restrictions on immigration which are set to be lifted next year, leading to an expected influx into countries like Britain.

Around eight million people a year visit the Louvre, which is full of artistic treasures including the Mona Lisa.
