A millionaire who built a 10,000sq ft leisure centre in his garden for his family with a 16-seat cinema, squash court, casino, bar and bowling alley has been told he must pull it down.

Graham Wildin, 62, spent more than a year constructing what is described as Britain's most 'elaborate play pad' but has been involved in a row with his local council after he told them: 'As far as I am concerned, I don't need planning permission'. 

The leisure-centre style complex also features a 25ft tall, three-storey doll's house, a soft play area and indoor tennis and badminton courts, and was dug down 18ft into the ground to avoid obstructing neighbours' views of the Gloucestershire countryside.

Legal battle: Millionaire accountant Graham Wildin, 62, has been told he must pull down a leisure centre, which includes a bowling alley, built for his family in his garden

Struggle: Mr Wildin said the structure, pictured, did not require planning permission but the local council disagree and want it demolished

But planners from Forest of Dean District Council say the luxury extension at the back of his six-bedroom home in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, must be demolished.

Today Mr Wildin has been given two years to destroy the structure after failing in his appeal against an enforcement notice.

The planning inspectorate ruled that the building is a 'bulky structure' and 'totally out of scale and proportion with the surrounding development.'

He declined to comment today but when he launched his appeal he insisted he had meticulously followed planning laws to avoid intruding on neighbours.

Mr Wildin, who runs an accountants based in Lydney, Gloucestershire, said: 'As far as I am concerned, I don't need planning permission as I have permitted development rights and I had this designed to take advantage of those rights, so I am within the law and I still consider that to be the case.

'This is for my family. I have three children and five grandchildren; I love them to bits and they come to my home on a regular basis. I have lived here for 32 years.'

Grand: The 10,000sq ft structure was branded Britain's most 'elaborate play pad' and contains a casino for family and friends to use

Argument: The 62-year-old said the centre was not bothering anyone and that he had built it for his grandchildren. He is pictured in the 16-seat cinema

Grand: Table tennis, badminton and tennis are among the activities Mr Wildin had in mind when building the impressive structure for his family

Mr Wildin, 62, has maintained that he did not think he needed permission when he started construction.

'This is my family home,' he said. 'All my children and my grandchildren come to visit, it's the place they all go.

'If all this fuss hadn't been kicked up nobody would know it was there.

'I have spoken to all my neighbours and none are bothered. They have all written letters of support to the council.' 

But not all neighbours were happy with the development. 

Andrew Buckmaster, 59, whose house is immediately next door to the bowling alley part of the extension, was the only one to lodge a formal objection with the council.

He said the decision to tear it down was 'brilliant'. 

'It should come down and go back to a garden,' he said. 'But why did the council allow it to be built in the first place? People told them.

'I don't think he will take it down. He is going to build a house in front of it, which he has planning permission for, so how will they be able to get back there and take it down?'

Angry: Neighbour Andrew Buckmaster, 59, said: 'It should come down and go back to a garden. Why did the council allow it to be built?'

Triumph: Mr Buckmaster, whose house is next to the bowling alley part of the extension, said the decision to tear it down was 'brilliant'

Modern: A state-of-the-art gym has also been installed in the complex in the complex which has taken almost a year to complete since breaking ground

The soft play area for his five grandchildren as it was being built over the past year. Mr Wildin spent months working on the property and maintains it is all unfair 'fuss'

Fun house: As well as a cinema room, the accountant built a games room with plush leather sofas, a table-football game and chess boards

These include, but are not limited to:

A five-metre tall wall stands about a metre and a half from the side of Mr Buckmaster's house, where he has lived for seven years.

The plumber added: 'When my neighbour started the project he told me it was not going to exceed 2.5 metres in height.

'He erected the steel and came and stood by me and looked up and said "that does exceed 2.5 metres doesn't it?".

'Today two men appeared and went to work on a back wall. The brickie said he has two more weeks' work to do.'  

Mr Buckmaster told the council he was unhappy about the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley.

'At night, it is one of the quietest places you could live,' he said. 'But the other night he had a practice with his skittle alley and it sounded like it was in my house.'  

Mr Wildin – who refuses to disclose how much the development has cost – said he wanted his family to be able to watch a movie, play roulette and go bowling without leaving home.

'If you look at the building from the street you can't see it at all,' he said. 'You can maybe just see a fence. You'd have to be in a helicopter to see it. 

'I looked at the rules permitting development before I started. They are very generous rules. There are five steps that must be adhered to, and this qualified in all of those. I built it to take advantage of all those things.'  

Mr Wildin has purchased the bungalow next door and is planning more works on his land.

The enforcement notice issued by Forest of Dean District Council states: 'The construction of walls and the erection of a building on the area of land which has been excavated is harmful to the residential amenity of the surrounding land in terms of the overbearing impact of a physical structure and the level of impact from the uncontrolled use of the building.'  

Construction: Mr Wildin dug out 9,000 tonnes of soil from his back garden to make room for the building and maintains that it is not imposing to neighbours

Complaint: Only one neighbour complained because he was unhappy with the height of the complex – and the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've got no issue with him and get on really well with him.

'To be fair, the lorries have been a bloody nightmare - the traffic and whatever. I can see why the people living immediately next door have got major issues. People think that maybe he thinks he can possibly do what he wants, but I'm not going to slaughter him.

'I don't know if it's jealousy - I don't know. People were signing a petition to get it taken down. 

'A neighbour the other day said to me 'has he got his comeuppance' but he works hard - he's up at 5am and not done till five or six at night.

'I just can't see him knocking it down. Is he going to pay the same men to take it down as put it up?'
