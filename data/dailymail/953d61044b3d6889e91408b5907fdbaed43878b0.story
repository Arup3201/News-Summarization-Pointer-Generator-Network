The widow of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev has started acting more like her old self by watching movies, listening to rock music and reconnecting with her family, her relatives have said.

Katherine Russell, 24, is living at her parents' home in Rhode Island with her daughter by Tsarnaev, and she is enjoying the activities once forbidden by her late husband.

She has changed her name back to Katherine Russell from Karima Tsarnaeva, the name she adopted after marrying Tsarnaev, who was killed earlier this year following a police shootout.

Moving on: Katherine Russell, 24, is pictured leaving her parents' home in North Kingston, Rhode Island, where relatives say she is becoming more like her old self by enjoying movies and music

'We're seeing glimpses of the old Katie 
again, and it's wonderful,' a relative told People magazine. 'We thought
she was gone forever.'

Even though she is becoming more relaxed in certain aspects of her life - including using nail varnish and visiting fast food restaurants, according to some reports - she has stayed strict in others.

'She
has made it clear to her entire family that she is a Muslim and will 
remain a Muslim,' the relative said. 'That's non-negotiable. The family respects that.'

Earlier reports said that her parents, Warren and Judith, were hopeful she would revert to her Christian beliefs, but she has continued to wear her full Muslim dress when leaving the house.

But they are relieved that she is on the path back to her old life after she was in the control of Tsarnaev for so many years, her friends said.

'She still wanted to hang out with her friends,
but he wasn't letting her,' Jesse Coyle, who used to date Russell's best friend, said of Tsarnaev.

'He made her get rid of her Facebook account,
and she always had to text him and let him know what she was doing. All
her friends told her to leave him, but she was hooked on him.'

It had previously been reported that she drastically changed after meeting Tsarnaev while at a club during her college years.

'Katherine was completely sub­servient to him,' a source told the Enquirer. 'She cowered around him.'

She is cooperating with officials in 
the investigation, but claims she had no idea her husband was plotting 
to bomb the Boston marathon as she was working 80 hours a week as a 
health care aide.

She has not been accused of any 
wrongdoing, but the FBI have questioned her to find out if 
she had any clue as to her husband's plans.

The bombing at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and injured more than 260.

Tsarnaev
and his brother Dzhokhar, originally from Chechnya, are believed to 
have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs.

Her lawyer Joshue Dratel, from New York, said that he joined Russell's legal team 
to help her navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her 
interests.

He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep co-operating.

'I
don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,' he said. 'There's 
no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.'

She was widowed when Tamer­lan was killed in a police shootout on April 19 – four days after he and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly set off bombs during the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed in the cowardly attack and 264 more were wounded, sev­eral of whom lost limbs.

Dzhokhar, 19, has pleaded not guilty to 30 charges, including 17 that carry the death penalty.

Before the bombings, Russell,
24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her husband and 
two-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North 
Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed.

Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it.

Two U.S. officials have said that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband.

One of her lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.
