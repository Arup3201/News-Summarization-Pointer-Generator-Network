Brave: Aid worker Cal Sarwar, from Falkirk, Scotland, who infiltrated the Taliban and lived to tell the tale

A British man may be the first Western civilian to infiltrate a Taliban training camp and escape to tell the tale.

Cal Sarwar from Falkirk, Scotland, posed as a disillusioned Muslim with a deep hatred of the West to join Taliban fighters in lawless Waziristan, north-west Pakistan.

If his cover had been blown, Sarwar - who has not military experience and who went in with no back up or escape plan - believes he would have been immediately murdered or taken hostage.

But he earned their trust and returned alive after an experience that was, he said, 'terrifying' in an environment that 'glamorised and normalised violence'.

After returning to Britain Sarwar has reported his experience to police and he has debriefed counter-terrorism officers with a description of what he encountered.

Speaking for the first time about his extraordinary mission he said: 'Since 9/11, I became increasingly concerned about the threat of terrorism and, more specifically, about the risk of my own family - and other innocent British youngsters - being brainwashed by these extremists through clever internet marketing.

'Having harboured this fear for many years, my chance came to do something about it when I travelled to Pakistan on an aid mission.

'I knew that this was my best chance to understand how these terror organisations operate and, armed with that knowledge, I wanted to prevent my own family, their friends and many other vulnerable British Muslims and non-Muslims from falling prey to these beasts.

'Having made some surreptitious enquiries, I met a Taliban fixer who, for a fee, escorted me to the training camp. What I learnt, and what I saw, filled me with dread. The place was far from a holiday camp, but I could see its appeal and excitement from a teenager’s point of view.

'It glamorised and normalised violence - it managed to make it appear acceptable.'

The fundamentalist Islamic Taliban emerged in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan in the chaos and internecine warfare following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

Starting with fewer than 50 armed madrassah students, the movement spread throughout Afghanistan by taking on corrupt warlords and cracking down on the widespread practice of 'bacha bazi', a form of child sex slavery.

It ruled the country as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from September 1996 until December 2001, with Kandahar as the capital, until the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Now it leads the resistance to the occupation.

'There is nothing, absolutely nothing, which prepares you for the Taliban’s brutality,' Mr Sarwar said.

In disguise: Mr Sarwar infiltrated the camp while on an aid mission to northern Pakistan

Cal Sarwar said a typical day in the Taliban training camp began with prayers at 4am. 

He said: 'To protect themselves and the camp, fighters sleep in shifts with at least three men on armed sentry duty at all times.

'If the others aren't sleeping, they will practice operations at night where drones can't see them from above.

'At 4am, or sunrise, morning prayers will start. For security reasons, such as in the event of an ambush, camp members will pray on a rota system.

'Prayers last for about 15 minutes and will include a reading from the Quran. Only after prayers do the occupants come together and eat breakfast in a communal space.

'At 5am, once breakfast has finished, the camp will plan the day's operations. There didn't seem to be a strict formula for the day's activities. Men would be told what to do in the morning.

'The camp generally seemed to separate in small groups, though. Some may undertake reconnaissance work, others will sit around cleaning weapons and waiting for orders.

'If members of the camp do head off from camp, they are under instructions to remain relatively close for safety reasons - usually a maximum of 30 minutes' walk.

'At around 8am, and if the men are in camp, they will pray again.

'Taliban camps aren't generally permanent, so if the group decides to move on they will do so now. They don't generally move far, but will do so under heavy armed guard.

'Interestingly, some of the men will go back to their villages to check on their families and children.

'If the camp isn't moving on, they will eat in shifts at around midday.

'Like with everything, cooking is done on a rota basis; if people aren't cooking or out on patrol, they'll be sleeping.

'At 3pm there are generally more prayers, and again at 6pm following an evening meal. In the evening, most of the camp will be on high alert from the Pakistani military.

'Those left in the camp overnight will say their final prayers at around 9pm before sleeping in rota patterns.'

Mr Sarwar witnessed the Taliban's brutality when he visited Pakistan on a four-week-long aid mission with The Equality Insaaf Human Rights Foundation in 2012.

During his mission to distribute hygiene packs, he visited orphanages and madrassas across the Punjab and northern Pakistan, where he claims he witnessed clerics and elders beating and abusing young children. 

He witnessed kids as young as four receive vicious beatings - often for minor offences such as looking the wrong way, failing to recite a passage in the Quran correctly, or for talking during prayers.

The beatings ranged in severity from slaps to 'full-blown' attacks with bats, sticks or metal poles.

It was not uncommon for children aged between four and 16 to suffer from broken bones, he said.

'They justified these beatings by claiming that the children were not being "proper" Muslims and that they had to be taught a lesson,' said Sarwar.

'This is a culture where forced education and corporal punishment go hand-in-hand.

'It's a culture where children are made to fear their elders, and Islam generally, from a very, very young age.'

Nevertheless orphanages were recruiting grounds for the terrorists, who took advantage of the youngsters’ vulnerability and desire to find a family environment. 

It was in the Pakistani city of Multan, in the Punjab region, where Sarwar decided to learn more about the Taliban and attempt to infiltrate their ranks.

He drove north to an area known for its strong links with the Taliban, where he 'put the word out' among local sympathisers.

Within a few days, a deal was cut with a tribal elder who arranged for Sarwar to meet a ‘fixer’, a former Afghan Army soldier called Masood, in the dangerous Shawal Valley of North Waziristan.

Masood, who was carrying a pistol, escorted Mr Sarwar to a Taliban settlement where he was grilled by an armed leader about his intentions.

'I was questioned for 45 minutes under the watchful eye of his guards - and I was terrified,' said Mr Sarwar.

'He said the Taliban needed money, so I told them that I could arrange this for them in the UK. This seemed to do the trick - it was the "in" I needed.'

He was asked to return the following day, and was taken back to the camp in a 4x4 packed with armed insurgents.

'This was the only time that I genuinely believed that I may be killed - that I was being whisked away into the middle of the mountains for some heinous purpose,' said Sarwar.

But to his surprise, he was welcomed 'with open arms' and went on to meet many of the camp’s members.

He also caught a glimpse of their weapons cache - a tent packed with bags of pistols, Kalashnikov assault rifles, and ammunition.

One of the leaders told him that the camp was 'doing well' and that it was training seven or eight British men from London.

Mr Sarwar was later offered full training at the 'academy' in exchange for £1,000. This, he was told, would be used to fund training facilities and to buy bomb-making components.

Feigning interest, he left after two days on the pretence of getting the cash - but never returned.

He said: 'It was incredible to think that I managed to meet - and be invited to join - the Taliban within just seven days.

'If I was able to accomplish this on a whim and without any prior research, it is no surprise that British youngsters are being recruited by the Taliban, ISIS and others.'

Mr Sarwar said the experience will help him to protect his own children from joining homegrown terror cells, or from becoming ‘lone wolfs’.

He decided to write a fictionalised account of his experiences in a bid to engage with more people and provide insight into the 'terrorist mind-set and machinery'.

The book - The Cell, The Wolf & The Faith: They Love Death More Than We Love Life - published by E&P, is now on sale in print and eBook format.

Mr Sarwar chose not to publish the book, written as a thriller, under a pseudonym.

'As a Muslim myself I am not in any way criticising Islam, a religion I hold dear to my heart,' he said.

'I have had my manuscript read by many Islamic scholars and clerics from around the world and I have been assured my book does not contain anything blasphemous, insulting or derogatory about any religion or faith including Islam.

'I criticise only the tiny proportion of Muslims who continue to use the name of Islam in vain and for their own political or militarist purposes.'
