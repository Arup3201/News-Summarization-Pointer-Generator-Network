Jailed: David Griffiths, 50, billed himself as 'Britain's answer to Steven Spielberg' to take £800,000 from would-be investors

A businessman who posed as 'Britain’s answer to Steven Spielberg' to trick animation companies into investing more than £800,000 has been jailed for three years.

David Griffiths, 50, conned investors by pretending to be a multi-millionnaire owner of a successful production company with close links to animation giants Pixar.

A court heard he used 'smoke and mirrors' to swindle victims into investing in seven children’s TV shows which he claimed had the potential to be 'successful global phenomenons'.

But only one - called Boblins - was ever made, which turned out to be a flop when it aired in the UK in 2006.

Other shows - called Odd Jobbers, Monster School, Galactic Circus, Ambers’ Animals, Inuit Adventures and - never made it to air.

Birmingham Crown Court was told Griffiths claimed to be Britain’s answer to Steven Spielberg’s Dreamworks studios to dupe victims into investing heavily in the shows.

He even lied to interested parties about having backing from McDonalds - who he said were interested in putting toy merchandise based on Boblins into Happy Meals.

In January he went on trial accused of a string of a string of fraud charges alongside his business partner Simon Drew.

Following a four-month trial a jury found Griffiths guilty of one count of fraud and three of procuring the execution of a valuable security.

Drew, 49, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, was cleared of all charges.

On Wednesday, Griffiths was jailed for three years by Judge Roderick Henderson who told him: 'You were carried away with the enthusiasm of your scheme and lost control with the result the businesses were developed at reckless speed.

'You told significant lies to potential investors with the result that they invested in your schemes when they otherwise might not.'

Scam: Griffiths persuaded companies to invest in seven TV shows but only one was made. Boblins flopped in 2006. Odd Jobbers, Monster School, Galactic Circus, Ambers' Animals and Inuit Adventures never made it to air

The court heard Griffiths and Drew ran a company called InspireGLG Limited in Bewdley, Worcestershire.

Over £6million was invested in the show Boblins which was also unsuccessful in Sweden, Norway, Canada and New Zealand.

Almost £14million was paid out between 2004 and 2009 but many programmes never made it to air.

Jurors were told by 2008 the company was in dire financial difficulty and the police were called in to investigate.

Cleared: His business partner Simon Drew, 49, also stood trial but was cleared of all the fraud charges

Prosecutor Malcolm Morse previously told the jury Griffiths was the driving force behind the fraud and victims were induced by using figures relating to the success of Disney products or Thomas the Tank Engine.

He said: 'You are being sold the notion that here in Bewdley, the West Midlands, is the answer to DreamWorks if you are just so lucky as to put your money in his care.'

Griffiths, from Oreton, Shropshire, was acquitted of 17 counts of deception and 12 other fraud charges.

The judge said he accepted the business had not been been set up with the intention to cheat people out of their money.
