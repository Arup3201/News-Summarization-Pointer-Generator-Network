Surgery: Angelina Jolie had a preventative mastectomy but a survey found one in four British women are afraid to find out if they are at risk

British women at risk of ovarian cancer have been accused of ‘burying their heads in the sand’ after a quarter of respondents to a new survey admitted they would be ‘too scared’ to undergo DNA tests to find out whether they had a 50 per cent genetic chance of developing the disease.

In the same survey, one in three claimed to have a family history of the disease, but 40 per cent said they had taken no action yet to find out their own genetic risk.

Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynaecological cancer, killing one woman every two hours in Britain.

There are more than 7,000 new UK diagnoses each year, a third of which are caught at a late stage, due to lack of awareness of the symptoms earlier on.

Almost one in five cases of ovarian cancer are due to a mutation in the BRCA1/2 gene, which also increases the chances of developing breast cancer to 87 per cent and is the cause of one in ten cases.

Genetic testing is offered on the NHS to any woman with a family history of either disease who requests it, and now campaigners want screening to be offered to all patients at the point of diagnosis.

Many who test positive for the BRCA gene mutation choose to have preventative surgery – a mastectomy (surgical removal of the breasts) and removal of the female reproductive organs – which reduces the risk of disease to ‘almost nothing’, according to experts.

In 2013, actress Angelina Jolie became the highest-profile star to undergo a preventative mastectomy after discovering she carried the BRCA gene. Jolie has said she is considering surgery to remove her ovaries.

In the months after her revelation, referrals for genetic testing in Britain doubled to 4,847 compared with 1,981 referrals in the same period in 2012, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. 

Whether the ‘Jolie effect’ has been sustained remains to be seen, as the UK Genetic Testing Network has not released up-to-date figures.

Charity Ovarian Cancer Action released their figures ahead of Ovarian Cancer Action Month this month and are calling for women to be ‘BRCA aware’ by completing an online risk calculator on their website, ovarian.org.uk.

Katherine Taylor, chief executive of the charity, said: ‘Knowing that you’re at greater risk of developing cancer can be frightening but the benefits of knowing far outweigh a temptation to bury your head in the sand.’

There’s no screening tool or routine testing for ovarian cancer, as there is with breast cancer, and symptoms are often confused, by both women and doctors, for other conditions.

Of the women surveyed, more than half were unaware that persistent stomach pains and bloating could be a sign, while 33 per cent said they didn’t know of any symptoms associated with ovarian cancer.

‘We want women to know there is support and information given before and after genetic testing, and surgery is not the only option,’ added Taylor.
