Radical plan: Business Secretary Vince Cable aims to break the stranglehold of the four big lenders with a state-backed business bank

A state-backed small business bank will be handed £1billion of taxpayers’ money to break the stranglehold of the big four lenders, Vince Cable will say today.

The Business Secretary will unveil details of Treasury plans to sponsor a new bank which is to offer credit through smaller providers such as Handelsbanken, the Co-Op and the Aldermore.

Mr Cable has scored a significant victory over Chancellor George Osborne in securing new public money for the institution.

The Treasury had initially intended simply to put existing Government lending initiatives under one roof and call it a business bank.

Both Mr Cable’s business department and the Treasury will contribute to the £1billion public money put into the project, potentially meaning more spending cuts.

The private sector is expected to contribute at least as much again, allowing the bank to underwrite around £10billion of lending to small businesses.

However, despite the urgency of the squeeze on firms, the new bank is not expected to be up and running for 12 to 18 months.

Mr Cable admits many firms still face serious problems in raising finance, with 33 per cent which applied for a loan in the last year being turned down.

The creation of the state-backed business bank is a tacit admission that Project Merlin, the Government’s attempt to set tough new lending targets for the big four banks – Lloyds TSB, Barclays, RBS and HSBC – has done little to help.

Business groups have been calling for a single institution, backed by the state, to address the gaps in the supply of finance for several years. The proposal is inspired by similar models in Germany, the U.S. and Ireland.

The Business Secretary will say: ‘For decades British industry has lacked the sort of diverse, long-term finance that is normal elsewhere. We need a British business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending rapidly and we are now going to get it.

‘Alongside the private sector, the bank will get the market lending to manufacturers, exporters and growth companies that so desperately need support. It will be a lasting monument to our determination to reshape finance so it can finally serve industry the way it should.

‘Its success will not be the scale of its own direct interventions but how far it shakes up the market in business finance and helps to ease constraints for high-growth firms.’

Mr Cable will tell the Liberal Democrat conference that the bank will support up to £10billion of finance to small and medium businesses – a significant portion of all the lending available.

The bank, he will say, will operate at arm’s length from Government and be commercially focused.

John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘We are pleased that ministers are heeding our call to create a business bank that goes well beyond a re-badging of existing schemes.

‘The funding announced by Vince Cable is the first step in a journey toward a British Business Bank that enables new and growing companies to get access to capital in the same way that they do in Germany, South Korea, and the USA.’

John Walker, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The small business bank is a good thing – we’ve been calling for this for a long time and we are delighted to see it finally get off the ground.

‘We are certain it will help boost confidence and deliver growth.’

The Daily Mail has highlighted the plight of struggling small firms with its ‘Make the Banks Lend’ campaign for several years.

The small business loan market currently has around £50billion of outstanding loans, and the typical amount of capital set aside by a large high street bank for supporting this area of the economy is at most a few billion pounds.

Mr Cable warned Tory colleagues last night that regional public sector pay – an idea being examined by Chancellor George Osborne – was ‘completely unacceptable’ and ‘terrible economics’.

He said, however, that the Lib Dems were prepared to contemplate a degree of flexibility in different parts of the country to aid recruitment.
