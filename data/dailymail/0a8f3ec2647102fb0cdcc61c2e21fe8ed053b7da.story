The gleam in Leeza Gibbons' eyes these days isn't only because she's managed to make the cut on Celebrity Apprentice along with seven of the original 16 contestants. Leeza, who launched one line of jewelry last year, is about to introduce her second line of jewelry.

Since she was a young girl growing up in Irmo, South Carolina, the 57-year-old former Entertainment Tonight host has had a thing for bling, insisting everything looks better with a little sparkle and shine. 

Her father Carlos, a school superintendent turned antique shop owner, shared his love of fabulous finds with his daughter.

'I've always loved jewelry,' Gibbons tells Daily Mail Online in an exclusive interview. 'And I could get lost in the rows of pearls and broaches Daddy displayed at his shop.'

'My sister and I used to joke that we had to hide any pieces of our own that w  truly loved, because Dad was likely to slap a price tag on it, put it in a display case and offer it up to customers.'

Sparkle: Leeza Gibbons has managed to make the cut on Celebrity Apprentice along with seven of the original 16 contestants. And now she's ready to launch a new jewelry line. 

Arms of love: Leeza's inspiration was actually a picture she had of her mom after she was diagnosed. Says Leeza. 'In the photo I had my arms wrapped around mom and I was telling her I would always protect her'

Shop 'til they drop: Leeza and her father Carlos still search flea markets for funky costume jewelry as well as more pricey estate baubles

Leeza and her dad still search flea markets for funky costume jewelry as well as more pricey estate type baubles.

She admits that she became an even more avid collector once she launched her TV career. And she says that since the 1970s, she's amassed a huge collection of costume jewelry.

'I am not kidding, I have entire closets devoted to my jewelry collection,' the glamorous mother of three reveals.

Now, however, the Emmy Award-winning Gibbons, who co-hosted Entertainment Tonight from 1984 to 2000, is turning her passion into a business venture and has launched not one, but two, jewelry lines.

The first, Arms of Love, was inspired by love for her late mother Gloria Jean who died in 2008  of Alzheimer's disease

'My inspiration was actually a picture I had of my mother and I together after she was diagnosed,' says Leeza. 'In the photo I had my arms wrapped around mom and I was telling her I would always protect her.

'Of course I couldn't do anything to stop the progression of that life-changing illness, but I could let her know that she would be wrapped in my love always and forever no matter what.

'In fact, to this day whenever I write a card, note or email to one of my three children, I always sign it AFNMW - always and forever, no matter what. And if you turn over each piece in my Arms of Love Jewelry line, you will see those very initials engraved on the back.'

'Brandi and I bonded during production of Celebrity Apprentice because of our love for our kids,' says Leeza. She gave her these necklaces as a gift

The Arms of Love collection features pieces in 10 Karat gold and sterling silver with most containing a small diamond. Prices start as $200 and go up to $320.

Gibbon's newest line – Wishes & Dreams – is due out in February and will be available at Kohl's stores and online. She says it's a real opportunity for her to share her message with the viewers and listeners who have grown up with her.

'I am a strong believer in making your dreams come true,' says Gibbons. 'A wish is a really powerful thing and when you fuel it with your intentions and believe in it with all your heart, your dreams can become reality. So for this line, we designed pieces that signify all types of wishes and dreams.'

Leeza says she has had a lot of fun gifting her close friends with early pieces from her collections.

'One of the first pieces I gave away from Arms of Love, was to my dear friend Olivia Newton John,' says Gibbons. 'I consider her my mentor and when I was younger I wanted to have just a fraction of her goodness and likability. 

'In 2008 Olivia and I became close friends when we walked the Great Wall of China together to raise money for her cancer and wellness center. That's when I met her new husband for the first time. I was so encouraged by the way she found love for a second time, that I allowed myself to open my heart and trust again even though I had not been able to make marriage work before.

'That was the energy shift I needed because I found my current husband Steven and we couldn't be happier.'

Leeza recently surprised her friend Brandi Glanville with a piece from her line Wishes & Dreams.

'Brandi and I bonded during production of Celebrity Apprentice because of our love for our kids. We both wished the world for them and that all their dreams would come true, so I wanted her to have a necklace from my Wishes & Dreams collection.'

Let's get serious: Leeza and Brandi made a wicked team on one episode of Celebrity Apprentice

'Working with Donald Trump has been a real learning experience,' says Leeza.

Season seven of Celebrity Apprentice began production with 16 contestants and  is now down to a cast of eight.

So far Gibbons has outlasted such favorites as Lorenzo Lamas, Keisha Knight Pulliam, Gilbert Gottfried, Kate Gosselin and Kevin Jonas.

'It's been a blast working with all these great people and working with Donald Trump has been a real learning experience,' says Leeza. 'There has been a whole lot of craziness going on this season as well as a whole lot of toxicity! But come on folks, the toxicity is what makes it so good!'

While Leeza loves her own creations, these days some of her favorite pieces are gifts from her husband of nearly four years, NY Times best selling author, Steven Fenton, 45.

True love: Leeza says she opened her heart and learned to trust again with husband Steven Fenton even though she had not been able to make marriage work before

'Every year, Steven gives me a special locket of some kind on Valentine's Day that contains a photo of us together taken the previous New Years' Eve. Some of the lockets are simple gold, some have diamonds and some are vintage pieces, but they are all treasures.

'I love the idea that my jewelry is a celebration of moments between lovers, family and friends,' says Leeza. 'I try and design the sort of pieces men love to give, and women love to receive, and it's a great feeling to know that in some way I am helping others build the same kind of memories Steven and I have built.

'A piece of jewelry is an intimate exchange of an expression,' she adds. 'It represents something precious and private that we share and that makes the giving and receiving of jewelry so special.'

Leeza's Arms of Love collection is available at Reeds.com.
