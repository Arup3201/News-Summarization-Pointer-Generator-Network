Jessops has closed all its stores with immediate effect, triggering the loss of up to 2,000 jobs.

The high street camera chain, which has 187 stores, is the first of what is expected to be many retail casualties in 2013.

The shops will not re-open and about 1,370 store staff will lose their jobs immediately. The rest, who work at Jessops’ Leicester headquarters, are likely to follow soon afterwards.

No hope: Administrators Pricewaterhouse Coopers have announced that all 187 branches of camera chain Jessops will close with the loss of 1,370 jobs

Customers who bought products in the run-up to Christmas will be unable to get repairs or refunds on faulty goods and gift tokens will not be honoured.

It appears that poor festive trading 
was the final nail in the coffin for a Britain’s only specialist 
nationwide camera retailer, a fixture on High Streets for almost 80 
years.

Pricewaterhouse-Coopers (PwC) were appointed earlier this week after it became clear Jessops had effectively run out of cash.

Yesterday, they admitted the chain, which can trace its roots to 1935, has no future and so the shops would close with immediate effect.

PwC's Rob Hunt said: 'Since my appointment, we have reviewed the position of the business and 
held extensive discussions with suppliers around their support for 
ongoing trading.

Closed: Every branch of Jessops, including this one in Bath, will shut for good at the end of trading today with customers unable to return goods

'It is apparent that we cannot continue to trade and as a result we have had to make the difficult decision to begin the closure of all 187 Jessops stores at the close of business today.

'Regrettably, this will result in around 1,370 job losses across the stores with further job losses likely, in due course, at the head office in Leicester.

'The stock will be collected over the coming days and returned to a central warehouse.

'It will be returned to suppliers if they are entitled to it.

'As a consequence of the closure, Jessops is no longer able to accept returned product from customers.

'This is an extremely sad day for Jessops and its employees.

'We are very grateful for the support we have received since our appointment and we will continue to ensure that employees are paid as they assist us during the closure.'

Jessops had 192 high street stores, although five of them were closed after Christmas, before the appointment of the administrators.

Branches in Torquay, Tamworth, Weston super Mare, Hereford and Walsall were all shut with the loss of a total of 23 jobs.

Administrator PwC had already said that Jessops would not
in a position to honour any gift vouchers purchased, and it would also not 
accept returned goods.

PwC said the company’s core market had
seen a ‘significant decline’ in 2012 and its position had 
‘deteriorated’ in the run-up to Christmas, as a result of reducing 
confidence in UK retail.

Forecasts for 2013 had indicated the 
decline would continue, PwC added. It said extra funding was made 
available to the company, but Jessops did not generate the profits it 
had planned over Christmas.

Mr Hunt said discussions to raise 
additional financial support had been held between the directors, 
lenders and suppliers over the past few days. But the directors had 
appointed administrators in light of ‘irreconcilable differences’.

1935 - Jessops started trading when Frank Jessop opened his first store in Leicester selling 16mm cine films. The business expanded significantly when Frank’s son Alan Jessop came on board, and set about transforming it into a cut-price retailer of photographic equipment.

1970s - Jessops moves to a new 20,000 sq ft site on Leicester's Hinckley Road, which is later named as the largest photography store in the world by Guinness World Records.

1980 - A second store is opened on the Finchley Road in London. By the end of the decade the retailer had 50 stores.

1996 - Alan Jessop retires and firm is sold in a management buyout.

2001 - The 200th store opened in July. The retailer had expanded to cover Aberdeen to Penzance, as well as stores in Jersey, Guernsey and Ireland.

2002 - ABN AMRO acquired a controlling interest in the business.

2004 - The retailer was floated on the London Stock Exchange. 

2008 - Jessops' Hinckley Road premises in Leicester is closed.

2009 - Jessops narrowly avoided administration by securing a debt-for-equity swap with its lenders HSBC.

2012 - The retailer made losses of £5.2million, when it also lost both its chief executive Trevor Moore and chairman David Adams. 

The chain was launched in 1935 by Frank Jessop, who opened the first photography store in Leicester.

But the firm has had a rocky few 
years. It managed to avoid administration in 2009 after its bank wiped 
out its debts in return for a 47 per cent stake in the business.

A number of household names – Comet, 
Peacocks, La Senza, Blacks, Game, Clinton Cards, and JJB Sports – all 
went into administration in 2012 and the British Retail Consortium has 
warned the pattern could continue into 2013.

BRC Director general Helen Dickinson 
said: ‘If you look at the amount of money people have got in their 
pockets, that is expected to continue to be under pressure.’

Jessops is the latest of
several household names that has fallen into administration in recent 
months as struggling families cut down on spending.

The number of High Street chains
going bust has increased by almost a
fifth in two years, figures released last week showed.

Some 194 stores and chains fell into
administration during 2012, compared
to 183 in 2011 and 165 during 2010,
according to data from Deloitte.

Everything must go: Last year saw the demise of La Senza, left, and Comet, right, among others, as consumers cut back on their spending in 2012

Last year saw the demise of Comet,
La Senza and Clinton Cards, with JJB
Sports, Blacks and Game also entering
administration.

But the number going under in the
run-up to Christmas dropped, with 37
chains folding in the final three months
of 2012, compared with 42 in the same
period in 2011.

The closure of Jessops stores has marked the first high profile 
retail collapse of 2013, with others certain to follow.

■ Online retailer Play.com is to shut down its retail business and become solely a marketplace for other retailers from March.

The Jersey-based company blamed the end of the Value Consignment Relief loophole which allowed items under £15 to be sold to the UK VAT free from the Channel Islands.
