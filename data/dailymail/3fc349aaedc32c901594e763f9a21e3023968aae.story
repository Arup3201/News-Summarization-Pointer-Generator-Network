The private lives of a council leader and his wife found shot dead outside their home in an apparent murder suicide will be investigated in the hunt for a motive, police said.

Norfolk Police believe North Norfolk District Council leader Keith Johnson, 58, killed his wife Andrea, 44, with a shotgun before taking his own life.

They are investigating possible motives, including aspects of both of their personal lives after it emerged that some people say they saw Mr Johnson looking depressed the day before the shootings.

Some neighbours suggested that the couple were in a 'very open relationship' but their family said that this was not the case and they loved one another.

Police are looking into the private lives of Keith and Andrea Johnson to see if they can discover a motive into what drove him to kill her and then himself

The family of Mrs Johnson, formerly Chadwick, issued a statement saying: 'We are devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter Andrea, she was a wonderful daughter, aunt and sister.

'She was so bubbly and full of life, she adored her family and has been tragically taken from us. She will be very sorely missed.'

It is understood Mr Johnson’s family will not be issuing any tribute.

The force this morning published the results of a post-mortem examination showing that both died of gunshot wounds.

The couple were found dead outside their bungalow in Norfolk at 2.50pm on Sunday.

Police were called to the property in Compit Hills, Roughton, near Cromer, after reports of gunshots.

A police spokesman said: 'Local neighbourhood officers and police community support officers also remain at the scene and will be working with the major investigations team over the coming days to support and reassure their families and the wider community affected by these tragic events.'

Neighbours and colleagues of Mr Johnson have spoken of their shock and disbelief.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Guy said it appeared as though Mr Johnson had used one of four shotguns owned and registered to his wife in the attack.

The couple did not have children but Mr Johnson had a family from a previous marriage. They had been together for 18 years and married in 2004.

Mr Johnson was also a former Cromer mayor, a long-serving member of both the district and town council and a football referee.

He was elected as council leader earlier this year and had helped organise the town’s Christmas market, launched at the weekend as part of a series of festive events.

He was seen attending civic events on Friday.

Mrs Johnson worked in customer services at Homebase in the town.

The Johnsons married in 2004 but had been together for 18 years. Both had been married previously and Mr Johnson had three grown-up sons and grandchildren. One friend, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It was common knowledge that they had quite an open relationship.’

Another said: ‘A lot of people raised 
their eyebrows when Keith became the leader of the council. They were 
famous drinkers. She would quite regularly get so drunk that she would 
fall into people – and more.’

Mrs Johnson’s grieving parents 
dismissed the rumours as ‘complete rubbish’. Her father, John Chadwick, 
said: ‘There was nothing wrong with their relationship. This was a 
lovers’ tiff that has gone wrong.’

Close neighbour Hilda Reardon, 72, 
said she thought Mr and Mrs Johnson had gone on a celebration cruise 
this year after she beat cancer.

She said: 'Andrea was very ill until 
fairly recently, I think she was suffering with cancer, she was 
practically housebound for almost two years and people didn't think she 
would pull through. Her parents would often visit in that time - she was
incredibly poorly.

'Keith was always very supportive of her, you could see how desperate he was for her to get better.

'In the last year or so, her health took a turn for the better and they both went on a cruise to celebrate.

'They seemed very happy and very much 
in love, I never heard them argue. Whatever has happened is truly 
tragic. I am completely shocked.'

Neighbours also reported unusually 
erratic behaviour from Cllr Johnson during his regular Saturday morning 
paper round. The former mayor was seen making deliveries in shorts 
despite sub-zero temperatures.

Jean Cheesman, 72, who lived in the house behind the couple, said Mr Johnson had been a 'little out of sorts.'

She said: 'He delivered my paper most 
days and we would always have a little bit of chit-chat on the doorstep,
pulling each other's legs.

'On Saturday he turned up on my door 
with the newspaper and he was wearing shorts and I said to him, "it's 
too cold for shorts this time of year, we don't want you to get poorly".

'I thought it was a little out of 
character given the temperature outside, and I wondered if he was a 
little out of sorts. He said another woman had said the same thing, 
smiled and went about his business.

'The next thing I knew, the helicopter was landing behind my house and police were everywhere - it's terrible.'

Cromer deputy mayor David Pritchard 
said: 'My wife and I were deeply shocked and upset to hear of the deaths
of Andrea and Keith Johnson.

'Keith and Andrea were a lovely couple and I was not aware that they were having any problems.

'I know that Keith was a beater for pheasant shoots and I know from conversation that they kept a shotgun in their house.

'She did not have children of her own, but she doted on his grandchildren.'

The couple were said to enjoy a lively lifestyle despite Mrs Johnson's reported illness.

Neighbours said the 'prominent and 
much-loved' pillars of the community could often be heard enjoying hot 
tub parties with friends in their garden.

They regularly holidayed with friends and are understood to have visited the Canary Islands earlier this year.

The area around the couple's £230,000 
bungalow remained cordoned off by police last night, with Norfolk police
conducting forensic searches to establish the sequence of events.

A tent protecting evidence was seen in the couple's front garden, yards from a second tent in a neighbour's garden.

Mrs Johnson’s Porsche Boxster was parked on the couple’s front lawn, with Mr Johnson’s Mercedes E220 on the driveway.

Mr Johnson, elected council leader 
earlier this year, had opened a Waitrose supermarket in North Walsham on
Friday and oversaw the launch of Cromer's Christmas market at the 
weekend.
