A number of teenagers have fallen ill after a skate park was transformed into a makeshift pool filled with river water.

Crowds of young people flocked to the skate park in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, when word spread that it had somehow been filled with water from the nearby River Calder to cool off.

Pictures show at least 20 young people swimming in the dirty, brown water during the recent heatwave.

But the decision backfired when several have since fallen ill and are believed to be suffering from sickness and diarrhoea.

Dangerous: A number of teenagers have fallen ill after swimming in river water which was pumped into a skate park

Ingenious or stupidity? It is understood the water was somehow pumped in from the nearby River Calder

Ill-advised: The teenagers are understood to have been suffering sickness and diarrhoea since jumping into the dirty water

The skate park has since been drained and Calderdale Council has launched an investigation to determine exactly how the river water ended up there.

It is understood the water may have somehow been pumped into the concrete crater rather than it being filled by hand.

A nearby high school, Calder High in Mytholmroyd, has written to parents saying a number of students had become ill after taking part in what was 'not an officially organised activity'.

Environmental Health officers are advising anyone with concerns to contact their GP.

Emergency services across the country have warned against swimming in open water after a spate of deaths in the hot weather.

Daniel Clemo, 24, drowned while cooling off in a reservoir in the 
Brecon Beacons, South Wales, on Sunday.

And a 16-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man both died in separate incidents while swimming in a quarry near King's 
Lynn, Norfolk, last night.

Daniel visited the Cantref Reservoir 
near Merthyr Tydfil with his girlfriend Laurie and he 
returned the following day with friends when he made the fateful 
decision to go for a swim.

Daniel's heartbroken mother Christina today warned people to stay out of the water at the reservoir.

'I
 just want people to look at this and to stay away from the water - It 
entices all ages but it’s no good. They’ve got to go somewhere else,' 
she said.
