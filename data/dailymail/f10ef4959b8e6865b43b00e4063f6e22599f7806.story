Measles cases in a region hit by an epidemic less than four months ago have tripled in the last fortnight.

There are now 36 cases of measles in south Wales, up from 13 just two weeks ago, as children from four schools have reported symptoms.

Doctors are urging parents to properly vaccinate their children after fears of a second epidemic in Swansea have spread.

Cases of measles at four schools in south Wales have tripled in two weeks after doctors warned that two million children across the UK have not had an MMR jab

Despite an uptake of MMR vaccinations during the outbreak which killed one and infected 1,200 last November, health chiefs warned that 30,000 children aged 10-18 are still unprotected.

In April Dr Helen Bedford, of University College London’s Institute of Child Health, warned that two million children across the UK are still unvaccinated, while figures showed 81 per cent of children in London had no protection from the disease.

Figured from Public Health England revealed that there are 300,000 children without an MMR jab that are being targetted by a new catchup campaign.

Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was 'very frustrated' that a significant number of young people had been given the first dose of an MMR vaccine, but had failed to follow it up with a booster shot within one month.

Parents are being urged to make sure their children have been given two MMR jabs to fully protect against the viral disease

It continued to stress that two doses of the vaccination was the only way to protect against the outbreak.

Dr Jorg Hoffmann, PHW consultant in communicable disease control, said: 'Parents and young people should not underestimate how serious measles can be and how quickly it can spread.

'In a school setting, one child with measles sitting in a classroom for just one hour will lead to at least 70% of other pupils who are not vaccinated catching measles.

'To prevent this outbreak from spreading even further, it's crucial that unvaccinated children and young people receive two doses of MMR urgently and that those with symptoms do not attend school.'

Cases of measles have steadily risen since a now-discredited report by Andrew Wakefield claimed autism was linked to the MMR jab in the late 90s.

The outbreak in 2012 lasted for more than eight months and sparked a massive vaccination programme.

Dr Hoffmann added: 'Parents who have decided not to vaccinate their children are not only risking their children's health, but are putting other children at risk, children either too young to be vaccinated or with medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated.

'We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year and we are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease.

A now-discredited report by Andrew Wakefield (pictured centre) in the late 90s linked the MMR injection with autism and scared many parents off vaccinating their children

'The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine.'

Adults who have either never had the disease or work in close contact with children are being encourage to speak to their GP about getting vaccinated as well.

Dr Richard Pebody of Public Health England said: 'It is important to remember that measles is highly infectious and spreads easily in the classroom.

'Children who are fully vaccinated with MMR help to stop the spread of measles and therefore to protect their friends and families. 

'This protection is particularly important for those who have health problems such as weakened immune systems and who cannot be vaccinated but are at most risk if exposed to the disease.

'Those who have not received a dose of the MMR vaccine should contact their GP urgently. After the second dose individuals achieve almost complete protection.'

Measles is an airborne viral infection picked up after inhaling or touching droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

Children aged between one and four are the most vulnerable, and the infection can lead to blindness and even death.

The symptoms include fever, sensitivity to light, red eyes, and greyish white spots near the mouth and throat. A red-brown spotty rash also develops around the ears and can spread around the head and neck before going to the legs and the rest of the body.
