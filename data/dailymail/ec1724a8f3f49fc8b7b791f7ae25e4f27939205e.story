A serial killer who murdered an 18-year-old barista waited at the coffee shop where she worked to kill her boyfriend, police have revealed.

Israel Keyes, who recently took his own life in his jail cell, abducted Samantha Koenig from the coffee stand in Anchorage, Atlanta, after climbing in through the drive-thru window.

Homicide police Detective Monique Doll said Keyes bound Koenig with zip ties and then waited with his victim on the floor of the darkened structure.

Ms Doll said investigators reviewing the abduction captured on CCTV footage initially thought Keyes had Miss Koenig on the floor to wait and see if anyone had seen him climb through the window.

But after watching the tapes again, police now believe he was waiting for Miss Koenig's boyfriend who often picked her up from work.

Ms Doll added: 'What we found when we interviewed Mr Keyes was that he knew that the coffee kiosk closed at 8pm and he knew that because Samantha didn't have a vehicle there, somebody was going to come and pick her up.

'He was waiting for her ride to come there because he intended to take that person as well.'

Keyes, 34, ended up leaving with Miss Koenig shortly before the arrival of her boyfriend, Duane Tortolani II.

Ms Doll said she doesn't know why Keyes changed his mind about also killing the boyfriend, as he had also killed a Vermont couple last year.

She continued: 'I don't know why he left, but he made it very clear that was part of the plan. It was very fortuitous for Mr Tortolani not to have run into Mr Keyes.'

Mr Tortolani reported seeing someone in a mask standing near his truck at about 3am the following morning.

He confronted the person, whom Ms Doll said was Keyes trying to steal a debit card from the pickup.

Mr Tortolani then ran inside the home he shared with Koenig and her father to get his help.

Keyes, who had parked a distance from the house, was gone by the time the men came out, Ms Doll added. A debit card for an account Miss Koenig shared with Mr Tortolani was also missing.

Ms Doll said the once-methodical Keyes was losing control before he was arrested. She likened this to a drug addict's need to continue to take more drugs to match the feeling of the initial high.

In Keyes' case, this escalation went from single victims to the desire to kill pairs.

Shortly before killing the Vermont couple, Keyes came close to killing a couple parked in a car at an Anchorage park, police said.

He also considered shooting the police officer who came to shoo the pair away from the closed park, but abandoned his plan when a backup officer arrived.

Stolen: After killing Koenig, police said Keyes stole a debit card from her boyfriend's truck the following morning

Keyes, who confessed to killing Miss Koenig and at least seven others across the country, told investigators he raped and strangled Miss Koenig, leaving her body in a shed for two weeks while he went on a cruise.

Keyes was arrested in Lufkin, Texas, in March after using the boyfriend's stolen debit card.

Three weeks after Keyes was arrested, Miss Koenig's dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage.

Keyes was found dead earlier this month after slitting a wrist and strangling himself with a rolled up sheet in his Anchorage jail cell, where he was awaiting trial next year for Miss Koenig's slaying.

Before his death, Keyes also confessed to four murders in Washington state, two in Vermont and one on the East Coast with the body disposed of in New York over the past decade. There also could be three additional victims, for a total of 11 murders, according to the FBI.
