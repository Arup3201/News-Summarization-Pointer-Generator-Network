It's a video guaranteed to send shivers down your spine: A man attempts to tightrope walk, or 'highline' between two ice shelves, without a safety harness or net, the first time that this will ever have been achieved.

The video footage shows Frenchman Tancrède Melet attempting the 
first ever crevasse highline in 
Chamonix's famous Vallée Blanche.

It's just one of new online short film series directed by Sébastien Montaz-Rosse which shows three extreme athletes, for whom risk and adventure is a way of life, in a range of death defying situations.

Highlining over an icy crevasse without a safety harness or net, skiing down an almost vertical mountainside and conquering the highest alpine peaks, all three men push themselves to the limit in the name of adventure.

Barefoot, without a harness or a net, extreme athlete Tancrède Melet, shows what it takes to live life to the extreme as he attempts to highline between two ice sheets

It's a genuine heart in mouth moment as the highliner loses his balance and his footing, and falls from the wire stretching across the glacier but grabs it with his hand

Tancrède dangles by his FEET for sometime while he regains his composure, far above the icy crevasse

The extreme acts are captured in three separate videos on Sébastien Montaz-Rosset’s YouTube channels for Nivea Men, who commissioned the adventurers to cling to the side of mountains to promote their sensitive skin care range.

Melet is
 one athlete who is clearly not afraid of the unknown. Installing a line between two ice walls, he tries to cross the line unattached - balancing precariously above the gaping opening into the bottomless depths of the Géant glacier.

Tancrède confronts fear and comes out the other side triumphant. High in the air with only a rope between himself and oblivion, composure is vital or an icy death awaits. 

It's literally a heart in the mouth moment as Tancrede starts to wobble halfway across, lose his balance and slip.

Undeterred, Melet climbs back onto the highwire and continues his crossing without any safety harness

Nearly there: Highliner Melet continues across the sheer drop with only an icy crevass beneath him, to finish triumphant

But he manages to catch hold of the wire, where he dangles high above the crevasse, then turning himself upsidedown and hanging by his feet until he regains his composure.

Tancrede gets back onto the rope and finishes his death defying crossing, giving high fives to the cameraman on the other side of the crevasse as he steps to safety.

Joining highliner Tancrède Melet in the series of three videos are steep skier Vivian Bruchez and mountaineer Antoine Moineville in the French Alps.

Growing up in the mountains of Chamonix, skier Bruchez spends his spare time scoping out new descents and exploring new lines.

Sheer courage: Steep-skier Vivian Bruchez prepares to begin the ascent of an almost vertical mountain covered with precipitous rocks as well as snow

The final ascent: Mountaineer Antoine Moineville reaches the tope of a towering granite peak on Mont Blanc

His technique of 'dry skiing' alllows him to reach places with his skis on, where most wouldn't even venture. Setting off from the Aiguille du Midi, he enters into a labyrinth of couloirs and rocky dead ends hoping to find a way through to the untouched powder fields beyond.

Meanwhile Antoine's passion is climbing mountains. Already halfway through the training to become a high mountain guide, he takes his twin brother into the towering granite peaks of the Mont Blanc massif to share his love for climbing.

With a quick lesson on belay technique, Antoine sets off on a highly technical rock climbing pitch - hoping his brother will remember what to do if he falls.

The three videos commissioned by Nivea Men are linked by the comapny's strapline, 'when you’re clinging to the side of a mountain the last thing you want to think about is an awkward itch!'
