A web series poking fun at Bravo's 'Real Housewives' franchise is gaining a serious following of it's own.

'The Real Housewives of Benning Road' parodies the popular reality shows by pretending to profile the less glamorous women of Washington, DC.

The series has skyrocketed on YouTube where the first episode has nearly 250,000 views and some of the actors say they've been recognized in public.

Making fun: The Real Housewives of Benning Road started off as a parody trailer but turned into a weekly web series due to high demand

At first 'The Real Housewives of Benning Road' started out as just a spoof trailer.

Creator Mike Brooks liked the sound of  'The Real Housewives of Benning Road' and he thought a lot of people would find it interesting enough to click on.

'First of all I thought the title would be hilarious: The Housewives of Benning Road. A lot of the urban neighborhoods in the city, the stereotype can be hoodrats and ghetto fabulous and all of that, so I thought the title would be real creative,' Brooks told the Washington Post.

So he made a one-off spoof trailer.The low budget video was created after a quick call for actors on Facebook.

But when that video got over a hundred thousand views, he decided to turn it into a weekly web series.

'A lot of people on YouTube were saying we should make it a [series],' Brooks said. 'I decided okay, I'll just give them what they want. I'll keep producing episodes and see what happens.'

'The Real Housewives of Benning Road' follows the lives of characters called ReeRee, Lil Trina and N.E. Mandi.

The first episode features an especially funny scene where two characters go to get fake lashes and the extensions end up being almost three inches long, making it hard for the characters to see.

Brooks is aware that the show plays into stereotypes of low-income communities, but he says it's all in good fun.

'A lot of times, we like to laugh at our pain,' he said. 'I guess everything I look at, I try to find the funny in it. Whether it's good or whether it's bad. So It's not really to bring anybody down. It's to make light of where we live.

While some of the humor is DC-centric, the appeal of the show has spread and Brooks says he's gotten positive feedback from viewers all over the country.

Now Brooks hopes to find an even bigger audience for his show.

'Hopefully it will be on a network,' Brooks told My Fox DC. 'Food Network, wherever we start out it really doesn't matter as long as we get on the air.'

The second season of 'The Real Housewives of Benning Road' premiered today on YouTube.
