Steve Scott and Charlotte Kerwood became double trap Commonwealth champions as Team England claimed four of six medals on offer in the shooting.

Scott and Kerwood are both coached by Sheik Ahmed Al Maktoum — one of the richest men in the world — who also helped Peter Wilson to Olympic gold in 2012. Scott praised him for the positive impact he has had on his performances.

Double trouble: Steve Scott and Charlotte Kerwood of England celebrate with their gold medals on Sunday

‘Peter was
 generous enough to let me be coached by him after he won gold and it’s 
obviously working,’ said Scott, who blasted a perfect 30 to secure gold 
in an all-English final, beating his team-mate Matthew French, who 
himself nailed 29 of the 30 targets.

‘That
 normally wins, by quite a margin,’ French shrugged. ‘I couldn’t have 
wished to have been beaten by a better guy. An England one-two — you 
can’t get much better than that!’

Kerwood
 nailed 94 of her 120 clays in the double trap to win her fourth 
Commonwealth gold and finish two shots clear of India’s Shreyasi Singh.

Kerwood, who won her first Commonwealth gold in Manchester in 2002, when she was just 15, said:

‘It feels pretty good, I can’t quite believe it. The Commonwealth Games obviously like me, it’s a good event to come to.’

Kerwood had little time to celebrate as she lines up in her favoured event, the Olympic trap.

Rachel
 Parish took bronze behind Kerwood and plans to let loose. ‘I think 
there will be some champagne now,’ she said. ‘Possibly a lot!’
