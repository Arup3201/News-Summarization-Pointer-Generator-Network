A bungling drug dealer was arrested after a noise complaint led cops five pounds of heroin sitting on his kitchen table.

Neighbors of Frank Giardina, 49, called police complaining his music was too loud, he answered the door with a marijuana pipe in his hands, invited police in and they immediately found the stash, authorities said.

The haul totalled five pounds in heroin on the kitchen table and another 1,948 glassine baggies of the deadly drug, as well as packing materials and equipment, police said.

Fellow tenants in the Flushing apartment building made the call just after 11pm Friday, cops said.

The two officers standing in Giardina’s doorway were content to write him a summons for the pipe, but the dope invited them inside while searching for identification, said police.

The heroin was found almost immediately.

Police arrested Giardina and were able to seize the drugs after obtaining a search warrant.

A department spokesperson said it was too early to tell if the stash house was linked to the recent spate of heroin deaths from drugs labelled ‘bud ice,’ ‘income tax’ and ‘theraflu.’

Giardina was hit with three counts including possession greater than eight ounces and intent to sell.
