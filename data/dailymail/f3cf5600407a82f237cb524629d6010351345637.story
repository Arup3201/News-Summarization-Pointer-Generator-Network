Ikea is recalling 169,000 baby mattresses in the U.S. and Canada over fears they could trap or suffocate a child.

The furniture retailer says five models of sleeping pads fail to fit cribs snugly and the gap - greater than 3cm - could prove hazardous.

To date the company has received more than ten reports of infants getting trapped between  mattresses and the end panels of their beds. The children were not injured.

Warning: Ikea is recalling 169,000 baby mattresses in the U.S. and Canada (including the model pictured) over fears they could trap or suffocate a child

The recall applies to  the Vyssa Vacker, Vyssa Vinka, Vyssa Spelevink, Vyssa Sloa and Vyssa Slummer mattresses.

The involved products were manufactured in Mexico on May 4, 2014 or earlier. 

They have been sold in the U.S. since August 2010.

Flawed design: The furniture retailer says five models of sleeping pads fail to fit cribs snugly and the gap - greater than 3cm - could prove hazardous.

They range from $50 to $100 a piece.

Proof of purchase is not required to receive an exchange or a full refund for the return.  

Ikea spokeswoman Daniela Rogosic said Thursday the recall only affects U.S. and Canadian stores because the mattress supplier in question had not been used in other markets.
