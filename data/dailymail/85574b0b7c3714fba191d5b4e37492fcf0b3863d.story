Santi Cazorla was the first casualty of the Premier League's vanishing spray, as the Arsenal midfielder was covered by referee Jon Moss while waiting to take a free-kick against Crystal Palace.

The vanishing spray, which has been picked up by leagues across Europe after its successful use at this summer's World Cup in Brazil, has been cheered at grounds across the country on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. 

Fortunately for Moss, Cazorla saw the funny side of the incident at the Emirates when he took a dose of vanishing spray to the face in the 41st minute of the London derby on Saturday afternoon.

Despite Moss's troubles in north London, the spray has gone down a storm in England, with fans even cheering its use by officials during the first round of Premier League fixtures.  

It was used for the first time in English football at the Community Shield match between Arsenal and Manchester City at Wembley on August 10.

The spray is used by referees to mark out a line for the wall to stand at free-kicks, 10 yards away from the ball, and disappears after a couple of minutes.

It will also be used in the Premier League for the new season after its success at the World Cup.

FA general secretary Alex Horne said: 'Vanishing spray was a great innovation at the 2014 World Cup, having been trialled in South America, and the FA were instrumental in allowing this into the laws of the game in 2012 through our role in the International FA Board.'
