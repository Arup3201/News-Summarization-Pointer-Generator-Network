They are the ancient Egyptian monuments that people flock from all over the world to see.

So perhaps it is unsurprising that Egyptian architects have taken inspiration from the Pyramids at Giza to create a new skyscraper in the capital Cairo.

Plans for a spectacular addition to the city's skyline have been unveiled and the shape will look very familiar - not only is the pyramid building borrowing from Ancient Egypt, at 200 metres (656ft) tall, it will be taller than the Great Pyramid itself and the highest building in the country.

The Zayed Crystal Spark project will feature not one, but two pyramid shaped features. The smaller pyramid at the front will boast an impressive entrance and walkway, surrounded by cascading waterfalls 

The Great Pyramid is thought to have been built around 2550BC and reaches 147 metres (481ft).

There are three pyramids at Giza - built as burial chambers for three important kings, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure - and they are famed as one of the original Seven Wonders of the World.

The modern project will be known as the Zayed Crystal Spark, occupying a 798,000-square metre spot in West Cairo’s Sheikh Zayed district. 

It will be multi-purpose and have potential to be used for administrative, commercial and entertainment ventures.  

The development would be created by real estate developers and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA). 

The Ministry of Housing have announced plans for a spectacular 200 metre high pyramid skyscaper, which will be the tallest building in the country. The shining pillar will be adorned with a glowing capstone and commemorate the nation's prized landmarks

Egypt’s Minister of Housing Moustafa Madbouly omitted revealing the investment cost of the project, but said further plans would be revealed at March's economic summit. 

It was announced by the Ministry of Housing that 150 real estate developers, in the private sector, have been invited to attend the conference this month. 

It is hoped the project will attract fresh investment and help to boost the city’s job market, economy and landscape.

The complex will cover a 798,000-square metre spot in West Cairo’s Sheikh Zayed district and will be used for administrative, commercial and entertainment ventures

The structure pays homage to Egypt's most iconic wonder, and further plans will be unveiled at economic summit scheduled for this month
