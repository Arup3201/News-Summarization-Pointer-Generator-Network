America may run on Dunkin' Donuts - but apparently the state of Florida gets naked at the popular coffee and doughnut chain.

A West Palm Beach woman was arrested over the weekend after police found her sitting completely naked outside of a Dunkin' Donuts in Greenacres, Florida.

Shakara Martin. 32. told officers from the Greenacres Department of Public Safety she had gotten nude outside of the shop on a dare.

Martin, who was charged with indecent exposure, said she was doing on a dare from a dance troupe

She accepted the challenge and got 'fully exposed' as part of a pledge to join a dance troupe, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

The nude woman began apologizing when police arrived, the Palm Beach Post reported. 

She was offered clothes several times, but refused to take them. 

Martin was arrested for indecent exposure and brought to the Palm Beach County Jail.

The arresting officer did ask if she needed medical attention, according to the arrest report. 

She was released from jail after about an hour on her own recognizance. 

It was not clear whether she's retained an attorney and a phone number wasn't available for her.
