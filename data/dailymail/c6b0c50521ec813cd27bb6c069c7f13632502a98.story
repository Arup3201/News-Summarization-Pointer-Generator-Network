Bribery: John Geary has been accused of using his job as welfare worker to get sexual favours

A state welfare worker who allegedly offered extra benefits to a female claimant in exchange for sex has appeared in court.

Case worker John Geary, 41, from North Versailles in Pittsburgh, reportedly told a halfway house tenant that he would give her extra money and benefits in exchange for sexual favours.

The woman told investigators that Mr Geary offered her $40 for a specific sex act.

He also told her there could be more money involved depending on what she would do for him.

She described how he took her to a secluded part of the office and said: 'I help girls who help me out,' and, 'there's nothing like getting high and getting a (sex act) at the same time.'

Mr Geary allegedly boasted that he had 'helped' other girls in the woman's situation.

He said that he could invite women to his home at night because his wife works then and his children sleep on the second floor.

The director of the halfway house first notified authorities about Mr Geary’s behavior because the victim was too afraid.

Mike Manko from the District Attorney’s office told CBS Pittsburgh: 'She’s probably scared to say anything about this because for fear she’ll lose benefits and be ostracised by this man in his positions'

'She doesn’t know he can do to her benefits-wise, take away money, take away food stamps, things like that.'

Mr Geary allegedly told the woman that he had done the same thing with women in the past.

Mr Geary appeared on counts of patronising prostitutes, bribery in official and political matters, promoting prostitution, official oppression and criminal solicitation on Tuesday.

His formal arraignment is scheduled for July 16.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
