If his PR machine is a reliable source of information, North Korea's Dear Leader Kim Jong Un is constantly touring his domain offering his 'field guidance' on everything from missile launches to mushroom farms.

After five years at Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung University, the despot is no doubt a highly efficient technocrat. 

But these pictures show him working on a problem he can really sink his teeth into - food.

Serious work: North Korea's leader Kim Jon Un inspects cellophane-wrapped snacks as he gives field guidance to workers at the Kumkop General Foodstuff Factory for Sportspersons

Pitiless: Aides look on nervously and take notes as Kim inspects rows of soft drinks at the factory

Kim is seen here staring intently at rows of packaged snacks and soft drinks, as he offered his nuggets of wisdom to the workers at the Kumkop General Foodstuff Factory for Sportspersons. 

Appearing jovial in most pictures, the 32-year-old First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea chatted happily to staff and henchmen, who eagerly took down his advice in tiny notebooks.

However, he turned serious when confronted with the final packaged products, staring pitilessly at bottles of soft drinks and squatting down on his haunches to get a closer look at cellophane-wrapped snacks.

As white-coated aides peered nervously over their Dear Leader's shoulder, he took one package of unidentified multi-coloured sportspersons' foodstuff in hand and glowered at the rest.

The fate of the snacks is not known, but it is understood that the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army has a prodigious appetite.

I'll have these delivered to my country retreat: Kim talks to factory managers in front of stacks of bottled soft drinks - which from afar look curiously similar to capitalist equivalents available in the West

Next time I want a white coat that does up: Factory bosses scribble notes as Kim - who is a graduate of five years military officer training school - pronounces on the best way to run a food factory

Resisting temptation: Kim keeps his hands stuffed firmly in his pockets as he peers into a storage bin that looks like it contains thousands of crisps that assembly line workers are toiling to make in the background

Last September, after North Korea admitted Kim was ill, rumours swept the world that the tubby tyrant may have gout - a condition linked to an overindulgent lifestyle that is historically known as 'the disease of kings'.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. North Korea observers have speculated that Kim's weight and family background may have contributed to his apparent gout.

As pictures emerged today of Kim contemplating foodstuffs for sportspersons, on the world stage former senior U.S. officials met with North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator in Singapore.

Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council, a U.S.-based nonprofit, said the meeting would cover the North's nuclear missile programmes.

He said: 'It's two ways of taking each other's temperature.'

I like this place: Kim grins, although his aides are beginning to look rather uncomfortable behind him

You can all live, except the old guy! The aide pictured far right looks particularly unhappy with the visit

The U.S. and North Korea have no formal diplomatic ties, but former U.S. officials occasionally meet the North's diplomats in a bid to settle the impasse over Pyongyang's apparent pursuit of a long-range nuclear missile that could hit the U.S. mainland.

Pyongyang is thought to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs and has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006. But experts are divided on how far the opaque government has come in the technology needed to miniaturise a warhead.

Pictures of tyrant Kim's tours of his domain's nuclear weapons facilities have as yet not been released by North Korean state media.

His interest in healthier food may be as a result of his rumoured gout
