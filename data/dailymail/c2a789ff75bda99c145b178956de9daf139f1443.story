Sadistic: Nicola Tedder has been jailed for seven years for inflicting hideous injuries on the child

A sadistic woman who jumped on a little boy's stomach after losing her patience with him has been jailed for seven years.

The savage assault led to the child being rushed to hospital with a perforated bowel, Guildford Crown Court heard.

Nicola Tedder, 32, inflicted a catalogue of cruelties on the child, including plunging her fingers into his eyes, holding his feet against a piping hot radiator until they burnt and clasping her hands around his throat and pushing him under water.

She hit him on the head with kitchen utensils and even rubbed his face in his own excrement if he soiled himself.

Tedder, from Haslemere, Surrey, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

She was also convicted of four offences of assault causing actual bodily harm and one of child cruelty after a five-week trial at Guildford Crown Court.

Alexia Durran, prosecuting, said: 'On one occasion she held his feet against a radiator which was hot enough to cause burning to his feet.

'On another occasion, she poked her fingers into his eyes, causing him ulcers and abrasions to his eyes. It looked like something out of a horror film.'

The court was told that the defendant would put her hands around the boy’s throat and shove his head under bath water as well as hitting him over the head with kitchen utensils and rubbing his nose in his own excrement if he soiled himself.

But the most serious assault was when Tedder jumped up and down on the youngster last year.

Ms Durran said the injured boy was rushed to the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, suffering from excruciating abdominal pain.

'It was as a result of his stomach 
being stamped upon. A doctor said he had only seen an injury like this 
from a karate kick - which will give some idea of the force used,' she 
said.

Ms Durran said: 'The 
victim said that the defendant had jumped on his stomach with both feet.
 She was wearing flip-flops at the time.'

Tedder claimed that the boy was clumsy and injured himself

She said that a tear was discovered in the boy’s colon and he had to be transferred to St. George’s Hospital, Tooting, for specialist treatment.

The incident led to Tedder being arrested and prosecuted. The defendant denied all the charges against her.

Tedder claimed that the boy was clumsy and injured himself.

Jailing the defendant, Judge Michael Addison said: 'You deliberately jumped on his stomach. This caused very serious injuries.'

He said it would probably never be clear why Tedder had inflicted such violence on the child.

'You may have a short temper or a cruel disposition,' added Judge Addison.

He said the innocent child might well suffer from long-term psychological damage as a result of his suffering at her hands

The court was told that staff at the victim’s school had already noticed that the boy seemed to suffer cuts and bruising with a greater regularity than was considered normal for a child of his age.

'One of the staff remarked last year that the boy was walking like an old man,' said Ms Durran.

Andrew Turton, defending, said his client had never been in trouble with the law before.

'She continues to deny committing these offences which makes mitigation very difficult,' he said.

'These incidents took place against a background of stress,' he added.

The child cannot be named for legal reasons.
