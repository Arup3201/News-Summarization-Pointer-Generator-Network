One QPR fan couldn't believe his eyes when he came home from work to find that his dog had eaten his play-off final tickets as the post arrived when he was out.

The fan tweeted a picture of his ruined tickets with the caption 'The dog beat me to the post... #QPR #Wembley# Playoffs'.

The picture went viral and it came to the attention of Rangers' striker Charlie Austin who tweeted his sympathy to the fan and asked the club to do something about it.

Gutted: The fan couldn't believe that his dog had eaten the tickets

Hero: QPR striker Charlie Austin called upon the club to do something about the situation

Leader: Austin is QPR's top scorer this season with 20 goals in all competitions

To QPR's credit they responded to the request and told the fan that if he came to the box office they would reprint his tickets.

The fan's brother then sent a picture after the matter was resolved with the dog in a QPR shirt and a letter of apology.

QPR take on Derby in the play-off final on Saturday and will be hoping to bounce straight back from relegation the previous season.

Result: Austin's intervention prompted the club to offer to reprint the fan's tickets

Guilty: The fan's brother tweeted this photo of apology from the dog after the incident was sorted
