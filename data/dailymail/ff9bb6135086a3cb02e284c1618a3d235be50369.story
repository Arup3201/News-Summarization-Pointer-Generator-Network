A man has been killed and another injured after a £250 million building collapse in an exclusive part of central London this afternoon.

The worker, believed to be in his 30s, was killed in the accident at the former U.S. Navy building, in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair.

A spokesman from London Fire Brigade said a mini-digger on the second floor of the six-floor building fell to the floor below.

The victim was confirmed dead by emergency medics at the scene. The two men had fallen from the second floor to the first floor.

A general view of the site in Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, central London, were the partial collapse occurred. It was formerly the U.S. Naval Building

Grosvenor Square, in London's Mayfair, is the site of a number of embassies, including the American Embassy, which has a significant presence there

It is believed the demonstration is related to the current unrest in Ukraine.

Receptionist Salima Cherrad, 26, told Sky News: 'We saw a helicopter here in Grosvenor Square and we assumed it was something that happened with the guys and the scaffolding.

'There were lots of them who came out of the building at the same time and they were all gathering at one spot in the square.'

A spokesman from the London Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 15.43 to Grosvenor Square to reports of an accident.

'We sent three ambulance crews, three single responders in cars, the Dangerous Area Response Team, London's Air Ambulance and two ambulance officers.

'Sadly one person, a man, was pronounced dead at the scene by Air Ambulance doctors.

'A second patient, a man, was treated for minor injuries and was taken to University College Hospital.'

The building, which is close to the U.S Embassy, was sold in 2007 for £250m 
and the new owners planned to turn it into 41 residential apartments.

The Abu Dhabi Investment Corporation and property developer Finchatton 
then bought the building for the same amount in April 2013, with 
planning permission to convert the building into 31 luxury apartments.

Declan Sherry, chief executive of site contractor McGee, said: 'At approximately 4pm today, an incident occurred on the construction site at 20 Grosvenor Square which required an ambulance to be called for two workers who were taken to hospital.

'McGee, the contractor responsible for the site, is liaising with the workers’ families. We cannot, therefore, release any further details at this time.'

Property prices in Grosvenor Square have increased by a staggering 310 per cent since 2000, making it the most expensive square in London.

A  police spokesman said: 'At least one other person has been injured. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed'
