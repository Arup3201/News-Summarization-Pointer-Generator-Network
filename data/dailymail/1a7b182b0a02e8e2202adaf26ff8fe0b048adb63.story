Amelie Mauresmo has no plans to make major changes to Andy Murray's game, but believes she can help him refine his mental approach as he prepares the defence of his Wimbledon title.

Mauresmo, the former women's number one, was named as Murray's coach earlier this month, giving her only a couple of weeks to work with the Scot before his Wimbledon schedule gets under way with a first round clash against David Goffin on Monday.

'His DNA is not going to change dramatically,' Mauresmo said in the Independent on Sunday. 'Maybe I'm trying to add a few little things here and there, but the timing is difficult.'

Fighting against time: Mauresmo has only worked with Murray for a few weeks after beoming his coach earlier this month

While the short time available is one factor, the Frenchwoman noted she is not the sort of coach who plans to work on technical details, and will instead take a more philosophical approach.

'Andy knows that,' she added. 'We've talked about this. That's what I did with both Marion (Bartoli) and Vika (Victoria Azarenka), more about the game, how to play, but also how to approach it, approach the moment, approach competitions, and, with Marion last year, (how to) approach the length of the Grand Slam - which Andy knows pretty well already. I'm not going to invent any fancy new drills or anything.'

The philosophy Mauresmo espouses could hardly be more different, and more laid back, than Murray's previous coach, the intense Ivan Lendl.

'It's tough to compare Ivan and me,' she said. 'We are so different - in every way. I think our personalities are very different. I don't know Ivan very well. I know him through Andy's eyes. I don't think I will bring him the same as Ivan, which is good, because Ivan brought him a lot and maybe I can bring him different things.'

Murray's victory at Wimbledon last summer ended a 77-year wait for a British winner of the men's title in SW19.

Mauresmo, a former winner herself, has already seen the difference in Murray's approach with the burden lifted.

'It feels great, I think the pressure is less important now that he's won last year,' she said. 'I would say it's pure joy. Of course there is the goal (of winning again) and focusing on the game and what to do on the court, and how to be. But I feel first of all it's joy and being so proud to be there to defend the title.'Â
