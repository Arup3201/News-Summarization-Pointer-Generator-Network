A nine-year-old boy has given his little brother a life-saving Christmas present by offering him a bone marrow transplant.

Kiran Merrick donated bone marrow to save his five-year-old brother, Sam, who has chronic lung disease and a rare immune deficiency.

The boys’ parents, Louise, 32, and Paul, 38, of Waterlooville, Hampshire, have been told there is an 80 per cent chance the transplant will cure their youngest son.

Sam Merrick (pictured), five, has been given a life-saving bone marrow transplant thanks to his brother, Kiran, nine, who agreed to donate his bone marrow for the procedure

Mother-of-four, Mrs Merrick said: ‘We were all tested but Kiran was the one who had a 10 out of 10 match, which is the best match there could be.

‘Kiran told us he was scared so we talked to him in depth about it and said that if he didn't want to do it we would understand.

‘But he said he wanted to help Sam and started having numerous tests.

‘It was hard work with Sam and Kiran both in hospital but Kiran has done us both proud.

‘When Sam is ill now he always offers to give him more bone marrow to help his brother.

‘Sam's disease has meant he's caught more than the usual amount of childhood viruses and infections, with the severity much worse.

Sam (front right) was born prematurely at just 26 weeks. He has a weak immune system and has had so many viruses that his lungs are full of scar tissue. He is pictured with his brothers Kiran (back right), Liam, 7, (front left) and Jordan, 13, (back left)

Sam had such a weak immune system he had to be protected from germs as much as possible. He is pictured having treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital - he spent six hours a day, for ten days, in this plastic tent

‘But Sam has defied all the odds in so many ways and has many more good days now.

‘All the boys adore him and love spending quality time with him.’

Sam, who also has two other brothers, Liam and Jordan, was born prematurely at just 26 weeks.

He has a weak immune system and his mother says he has suffered from so many viruses that his lungs are full of scar tissue meaning he has lung disease.

Before the bone marrow transplant, he had to have 60 per cent of his right lung removed and was very isolated due to his illness.

Since the bone marrow transplant, Sam has become strong enough to be able to catch up on many of the childhood experiences he had missed out on. He visited Father Christmas, been swimming and started school

He had to have a rain coat over his buggy when he went out in case he breathed in germs.

Now, he is able to go to the shops, attend school and play with friends.

Mrs Merrick, who is Sam's full-time carer, said: ‘Sam fights infections a lot better and we are noticing a huge difference in him.

‘We hope this will be his first Christmas at home and not in hospital.

Sam's family is raising money to buy a caravan to allow other families with sick children to go on holiday

‘This year we reached numerous milestones such as being able to take him to a Santa's grotto and although he went really quiet in front of Santa he was chuffed to bits to receive a book.

‘He has also just started school full time and has been swimming for the first time.

‘This is a huge step in the progress Sam is making and a huge part of childhood memories that he has been missing out on.’

The family are now hoping to raise £30,000 to buy a caravan in Pagham, West Sussex, to provide much needed breaks for other families with sick children.
