Police should be allowed to catch 40 winks while on duty – and given special 'sleep pods' where they can nod off, say experts.

Work time 'sleep breaks' could help reduce fatigue and promote better concentration, according to researchers.

Instead of reaching for high sugar, high carb foods to maintain alertness, officers on night shifts could take brief power naps in pods like those used by multinational firms like Google.

Thousands of police from six forces are taking part in an 'officer wellbeing' study commissioned by the Police Federation into the benefits of dozing at work. 

Study leader Marcus de Guingand, who runs the 'fatigue management' firm Third Pillar of Health, said the results of his study – due to be published later this year – would recommend 'power naps'.

He said: 'There appears to be a caffeine culture among police officers – they use counter-measures to maintain their alertness. People working the night shift are a lot more likely to reach for high sugar, high carb foods to give them the quick lift they need.

'All that has a significant effect on health and performance. Together with increased workloads as a result of widespread budget cuts there appears to be rising levels of stress as well as absence.'

He added: 'I would suggest that where there is the ability to set up a room with appropriate furniture (beds or sleep pods), that would be a very appropriate strategy.'

Mr de Guingand said Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill both 'napped' during the day and that a 'siesta culture' was important for a person's wellbeing.

Senior police, however, have said the idea would be 'unworkable' and that the public would expect officers to be wide awake while on duty.

Although there is no 'official' ban on officers snoozing on duty, it is widely discouraged among the workforce. 

One inspector at Sussex Police, who asked not to be named, said: 'If someone is murdered and it comes out that half the response officers on duty at the time were asleep it would obviously not look good for us.'

Irene Curtis, president of the Police Superintendents' Association, said officers do need to be in a 'position to respond'.

She explained: 'I'm not aware of any prohibition on napping but the reality is officers do need to be in a position to respond.

'I am conscious officer wellbeing needs to be on the agenda of all forces in the future as numbers are reduced and officers are being asked to do more.'

Meanwhile Will Eastwood, of the North Yorkshire Police Federation, added: 'We hope that this study will go some way to assisting our officers and organisations in improving the management of fatigue in the future.

'The potential benefits of this being firstly an assessment that will make instant recommendations, often small changes that will improve quality of life, and secondly the collection of data which will enable analysis of what makes the most impact on officer fatigue.

'We have since been joined in the study by several other services, including, Sussex, Thames Valley and South Yorkshire; their participation will strengthen the quality of data gathered and is a great boost.'

A spokesman for the College of Policing said it was acting to reduce fatigue by working with occupational health, welfare and safety experts in individual forces. 

The study will be discussed by police chiefs later this year, with a view to piloting the scheme in several forces.
