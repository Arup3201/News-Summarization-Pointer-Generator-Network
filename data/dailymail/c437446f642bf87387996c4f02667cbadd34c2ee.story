This extraordinary ‘bayonet hat’ would have allowed British soldiers in the First World War to attack the enemy with their heads if it was given the go-ahead, it has emerged.

However, the incredibly rare prototype cap - which comes with a sharp six inch blade fixed to the top of it - was deemed too dangerous for soldiers after being considered by the War Office.

It has now been discovered nearly 100 years after the war and is expected to sell for more than £3,000.

The extraordinary 'bayonet hat', was the brainchild of British solicitor Philip Baker, would have allowed soldiers in the First World War to attack the enemy with their heads if it was given the go-ahead by the War Office

It is thought the idea was for the wearer to stab the enemy with the knife on the hat, either by running at them head first and ramming the weapon into them or by removing the hat and using it as a conventional knife

The item was the brainchild of British solicitor Philip Baker who patented the invention in 1916 and offered it up to the War Office for consideration.

He gave them a prototype cap along with drawings showing how it worked.

It is thought the idea was for the wearer to stab the enemy with the knife on the top of the hat, either by ramming their head at them or by removing the hat and using it as a conventional knife.

The design allowed the knife to be covered by a scabbard and locked in the down position when the wearer was in his own trench.

But, when in close combat attack, the soldier would have flicked the knife 90 degrees upwards and used it as a weapon along with his rifle and regular bayonet.

Both army-issue caps and steel helmets were to be modified with the foldable knife, with the latter doubling as a small shield and the dagger acting as the handle.

However, the War Office didn’t take up the option of the bayonet cap as it was considered too dangerous for the wearer.

It was one of numerous quirky weapon inventions that were produced during the First World War in a bid to give the British soldiers on the Western Front the upper hand.

Now the prototype hat, complete with knife fixed in position, has emerged for sale and is expected to sell for more than £3,000 when it is auctioned on June 25.

The original patent document is being sold with it, along with the basic drawings.

Matthew Tredwin, of C&T Auctioneers in Kent which is selling the item, said: ‘Many inventors and members of the public came up with ideas for items of uniform that may have helped protect the soldiers at the front.

‘This bayonet hat was meant for hand-to-hand combat and would have quite a barbaric weapon when you think about it.

‘We can only assume this item was made to present to the War Office to gain approval, but obviously was not considered as was not by any means practical.

‘It is very rare however to find any examples of items that were created but never put into production. It is truly a unique item, that you will never find another example of.’

The prototype has been held by the Wilson Military Headgear History Research Centre in the US for many years.

The centre was set up by the late philanthropist Robert Wilson. He died last year from cancer and the hat has now returned to Britain where it is now being sold.

Terry Charman, of the Imperial War Museum, said: ‘After the war settled down into trench warfare, uniforms and weapons were tailored for hand-to-hand fighting.

‘This hat is one of the weird and wonderful inventions that people produced to give the British the upper hand over their opponents.’

Tanks:

The first tank, the British Mark I, was designed in 1915 by William Foster & Co.

It was first demonstrated to the British Army in February, 1916 before going into combat at the Somme in September of that year.

British tanks were originally referred to as ‘landships’ by the Landships Committee, but were later named tanks after it emerged factory workers at William Foster referred to the first prototype as ‘the tank’ because of its resemblance to a steel water tank.

The French fielded their first tanks in April, 1917 and went on to produce more tanks than all the other combatants combined.

Flamethrowers:

The flamethrower, which projects a long, controllable stream of fire, was first used by German troops in February, 1915.

Some flamethrowers project a stream of ignited flammable liquid while some project a long gas flame. They can be used hand-held or attached to a tank.

The first design for a modern flamethrower was submitted to the German Army by Richard Fiedler in 1901.

They are primarily used in battlefield fortifications, bunkers, and other protected emplacements, causing horrific injury or death to enemy soldiers in confined spaces.

Aircraft Carriers:

The first proper aircraft carrier was the HMS Furious, which was built for the Royal Navy during the First World War.

It was originally a 786 foot long battle cruiser equipped with two 18-inch guns, but was reclassified as an aircraft carrier in September 1925.

The forward turret was removed and an area suitable for landing aircraft was installed in its place.

HMS Furious was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft and later as a training carrier once the new armoured carriers like Ark Royal entered service in the late 1930s.

In August, 1917, while performing trials, Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup, believed to have been N6453, successfully on board HMS Furious, becoming the first person ever to land an aircraft on a moving ship.

Air Traffic Control:

The First World War accelerated development of aviation technology and pilot training.

Before the war, there was very little, if any, communication between the pilot of an aircraft and the mainland.

However, during the war, the US Army installed the first operational two-way radio in planes.

Developments for the radio began in San Diego in 1915 and by 1916, technicians could send a radio telegraph over a distance of 140 miles.

In 1917, a human voice was transmitted by radio from a plane in flight to an operator on the ground for the very first time.

In 1921, Croydon Airport in London was the first airport in the world to officially introduce air traffic control to commercial flights.
