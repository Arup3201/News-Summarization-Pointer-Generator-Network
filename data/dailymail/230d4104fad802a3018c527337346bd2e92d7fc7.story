A new health watchdog has claimed some parents are 'in denial' over their children's obesity

Parents in ‘denial’ about their children being obese should be identified to prevent them becoming a barrier to losing weight, a national health watchdog says.

Thirty per cent of youngsters are overweight or obese, putting them at risk of serious conditions in adulthood such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence claimed parents may undermine efforts to get fat children and teenagers to face up to the problem.

‘Efforts to manage a child or young person’s weight are not always supported, and are sometimes undermined, by members of the wider family,’ it said.

‘This is possibly because of a lack of understanding of the aims of lifestyle weight management programmes and the importance of managing the weight of obese or overweight children and young people.’

New guidance from Nice says families must be encouraged to recognise the problem – particularly as children with at least one obese parent are more likely to become obese themselves.

The watchdog said it is ‘important to ensure the family and the youngster recognise and accept that they are overweight or obese’.

It added that a ‘lack of recognition, or denial’ can prevent them from joining, and adhering to, a weight management course.

These programmes can include Weight Watchers, which runs schemes of the type recommended by Nice.

Figures released earlier this year showed
the NHS has spent £4 million on Weight Watchers courses for fat people 
since 2007, with two-thirds of local health authorities offering them.

Many overweight and obese children and young people may have, or come 
from a family with, a ‘history of failed attempts to manage their 
weight’ says the guidance.

A family’s attitudes towards diet, exercise and the amount of time spent being sedentary should all be explored, it added.

In 2011 in England, around 30 per cent of boys and girls aged two to 15 were either overweight or obese.

In the 2011/2012 school year, around 23 per cent of children in 
reception and 34 per cent in year 6 were either overweight or obese.

Children and teens are being encouraged to follow weight management programmes such as Weight Watchers

The guidance calls for information to help families ‘master skills’ in reading food labels, ways to build activity into daily life and for providers to offer activities such as games, dancing and aerobics.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said Nice was ‘spot on’ with what needs to be done but added councils needed cash to carry out the job.

Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at Nice, said ‘Parents should not have to face the challenge of obesity on their own.

‘Obesity in children and young people is a serious and growing concern.

‘We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice.

‘These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long-term.

Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games.

‘Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child’s quality of life.

‘It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised. Local commissioners - including local authorities - need to make sure that the right services are available when families need them.

‘They also need to be convenient and easy to access - so parents and their children can stick with them.’
