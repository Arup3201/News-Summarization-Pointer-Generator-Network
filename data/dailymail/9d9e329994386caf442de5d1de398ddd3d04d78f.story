An eight year old boy suffered a fractured skull after being struck by a leaping sturgeon fish.

Nathaniel Smith was knocked unconscious after the fish suddenly jumped from the water and slammed into his head.

He was airlifted to hospital in serious condition with a double fracture of the skull following the terrifying encounter with the four foot long fish in Florida.

Freak accident: Nathaniel Smith is pictured in the neck brace he must now wear as he recovers from a fractured skull he got from an airborne sturgeon that leapt over his family's boat

The youngster is now recovering at home but has to wear a neck brace until further medical tests are carried out.

Two other children, his nephew Austin, 14, and 16-year-old daughter were also struck.

‘It happened so quick, and it was a big fish,’ said Nathaniel’s  father Scott.

‘When I saw it come over the boat it was too late. But I yelled, "Watch out!"'

Massive: While on the Choctawhatchee River near Vernon, Florida, a 4-foot sturgeon like this one jumped into the air and struck Smith, leaving his bleeding from the nose and ears

He said the fish leapt from the river and struck the children while he was preparing to dock the family’s 16-foot boat on the Choctawhatchee River near Vernon, Florida, last month.

Scott said his son was bleeding from his ears and mouth after being struck.

‘It was the scariest moment of my life,’ he said.

According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Sturgeon in the Gulf area can grow up to 200 pounds and 8 feet in length.

Scott Smith said the sturgeon that struck his son was at least 4 feet in length and may have weighed 100 pounds.

In the spring, sturgeon migrate from saltwater to freshwater, where they live through the summer. During that time, rivers in the Florida Panhandle are highly populated by the fish, said FWC spokesman Stan Kirkland.

Mystery: Florida rivers like the Choctawhatchee (pictured) are the summer home to sturgeon that can reach 200 pounds and leap six feet in the air, though scientists don't know why the fish do it

Nathaniel Smith is the second person to be injured by an airborne sturgeon on the Choctawhatchee River in the last 11 years, according to FWC.

Brian Clemens, of Chipley, suffered a collapsed lung, broken sternum, several broken ribs, and damage to internal organs when he was struck in the chest by an airborne sturgeon in 2002. He had been fishing on the Choctawhatchee River.

Scientists are unsure why sturgeon leap from the water, but U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish biologist Adam Kaeser said it could be a way for the fish to communicate with each other.

‘Another idea,’ Kaeser said, ‘is that they’re actually jumping to keep balance in their swim bladder, which is the organ that helps to maintain buoyancy underwater. But the short answer is we just don’t know why they jump.’

Kaeser said sturgeon can leap as high as six feet above the water.

And though it’s rare that sturgeon strike people, Kirkland urges boaters on the Choctawhatchee to slow down and be observant.

He also said FWC will be installing signs this week at Choctawhatchee River boat ramps to warn boaters of the sturgeon’s summer presence.
