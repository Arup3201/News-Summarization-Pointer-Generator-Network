Viewers have been shocked by Channel 4’s Benefits Street, portraying the lives of welfare-dependent residents on a road  in Birmingham.

Turn back the clock 100 years or so, and the newly built James Turner Street was a very different place, full of poor but hard-working families living in cramped conditions. But as this 1915 picture shows, a spirit of community prevailed.

The first people to move in in 1891 included blacksmiths, bricklayers, toolmakers, railway workers, jewellers and even a 13-year-old boy, described as a boilermaker.

Now: James Turner Street in Birmingham whose residents are featured in the Channel 4 TV show

According to census information, the 
terrace house now occupied by Deirdre ‘White Dee’ Kelly, was lived in by
 labourer James Jones, his wife and their five children, and his 
brother-in-law and sister-in-law. The current home of mother-of-three 
Charlene Wilson was lived in by the Roberts family of five and two 
lodgers. Next door was another family of six, a lodger and his two 
daughters.

Historian Bill 
Dargue said many people in the street 100 years ago worked in the iron 
trade, which would have would have been ‘hard and physical’. In 
contrast, James Turner Street today is blighted with crime and 
unemployment. Residents include alcoholic James Clarke, known as Fungi, 
and Mark Thomas, who admitted fiddling his benefits.

The history of James Turner Street, made
 famous by Channel 4's Benefits Street program, is revealed on a local 
website which details the background of Winson Green, Birmingham.

Ex-residents of the street speak of its 
crime-free and community feel and say they don't recognise the street 
portrayed on the program.

Researchers say the area used to be full of tradesmen and labourers as families moved in for work.

A website devoted to the area and its history, www.winsongreentobrookfields.co.uk, collects memories and photographs of James Turner Street's bygone days.

One ex-resident, John Cahill, wrote he was 'horrified' to see James Turner Street on the Channel 4 program.

He said: 'I was brought up in that street and considering how it was 45 years ago, a genuine community. I am ashamed to tell any one I spent my childhood there.'

Another nostalgic contributor wrote: 'I have just come across your site whilst looking for something else, and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw James Turner Street. My grandfather Edwin Rogers lived there.

'Those were the days when you didnt lock your door in the day unless the siren from the prison went off.'
