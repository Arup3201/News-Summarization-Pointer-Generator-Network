Diving and feigning injury are the scourge of the modern game. We used to blame foreigners but now everybody is at it and it needs to be stopped. How? By making sure we punish the offenders.

Last weekend James Tomkins and Ross Barkley got away with ridiculous play-acting. Barkley dived over thin air and Tomkins farcically held his face after he was pushed in the chest.

British players used to have a reputation for being strong and honest but that stereotype has disappeared. Since 2006, the three worst culprits in the Premier League are British. Gareth Bale (7), David Bentley (5) and Ashley Young (4) were all booked multiple times for diving.

Marouane Fellaini is no angel but he deserves credit for not reacting to Jack Wilshere’s head in his chest. He could easily have gone down to try to get Wilshere sent off.

Everything is appealed for — throw-ins, corners, tackles. Players are hard-wired to challenge the referee’s decision to try to gain as much of an advantage as possible. Diving and faking injury is an extension of that.

It’s ultra-competitive but it’s not very sporting.

One of the most important elements of any sport is being able to trust your opponent. You can go hammer and tongs for 90 minutes and then shake hands at the end knowing it was an honest battle. That’s where you earn the respect of your opponents.

When I played you never wanted to show you had been hurt — you’d only limp when your opponent wasn’t watching! In the second half of my career that changed.

I certainly wouldn’t be on a list of Premier League do-gooders but I relished scraps with Alan Shearer and Mark Hughes because they were hard but fair. One of the reasons the infamous incident with Ruud van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford came about was because I didn’t trust him — he was constantly falling over trying to win a free-kick.

The sad truth is that conning a referee is now part of a player’s decision-making process. They think: ‘Do I pass, take this player on or knock it forward and try to win a free-kick.’

Gamesmanship like that scrapes at the fabric of sportsmanship and it’s one of the issues that makes players’ and fans’ blood boil.

Player dishonesty also leads to a risk of further incidents. Dives provoke players, which increases the likelihood of retaliation. Football is full of injustices but if referees aren’t careful, aggression spills over.

It would be refreshing if managers castigated their own players but the best punishment is a ban. Fines don’t work, particularly on clubs for failing to control players. It’s far better to hit offenders where it hurts: with a suspension.

If a player dives then he should be banned. For a serial offender, double the number of games. The same goes for feigning injury. If these punishments already existed then the problem might already be eradicated.

This is an embarrassing issue and governing bodies need to look closely at it. Do we really want parents telling kids to take a dive or fake an injury in their Sunday league games? The standards set in the Premier League send out the biggest message of all. It’s time they got this one right.

PS 

Southampton v Manchester City is a defining match for both of them. For the Saints it’s a massive test. Are the big boys too much for them or is it gloves off and time to fight? Can City be champions again? There will probably be a lot of mixed feelings about that in their camp. The Bayern result was big but if they don’t beat Southampton, their title challenge could be over.
