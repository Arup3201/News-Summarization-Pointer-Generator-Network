Sightseers were stunned after spotting this £200,000 Ferrari stuck on a beach in Cornwall.

The lime green 458 Spider, which has a top speed of 200MPH and is capable of 0-60mph in just over three seconds, was spotted trapped in the sand at Watergate Bay, near Newquay yesterday.

Although there were concerns the vehicle had been driven onto the beach by a reckless owner, it later emerged that it was in fact being used in a fashion shoot for Official Ferrari Magazine - although it still required a tractor and trailer to pull it out the sand.

Stuck: Ferrari confirmed that a 458 Spider became trapped on Watergate Bay, but said it had been driven there as part of a fashion shoot for Official Ferrari Magazine. It added that the car was towed to safety by a tractor

The vehicle had been loaned to the magazine by the Carrs Ferrari dealership in Exeter and the plan was for it to take centre stage in a fashion shoot that will appear in a forthcoming issue.

Shortly after the vehicle was unloaded, however, its wheels became embedded in grooves in the sand that had been left by a tractor that delivered it onto the beach.

Ferrari confirmed that the incident had taken place, but said at no point was the vehicle at risk of being swept out to sea.

In a statement, a spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the Ferrari 458 Spider pictured on the beach at Watergate Bay on Wednesday.'

Power: The Ferrari 458 Spider boasts a 4.5-litre V8 engine, an F1 dual clutch 7-speed transmission and an aluminium roof that can be retracted in 14 seconds

'Unfortunately, when the Ferrari 458 Spider was off-loaded from the trailer, the rear wheels bedded-down into the ruts created by the tractor, giving the impression that the car had beached itself,' he added.

Watergate Bay is a private beach owned by the Watergate Bay Hotel, who gave Ferrari permission to run the photo shoot.

Ferrari said that at no point was the 458 Spider actually driven on to the beach, and confirmed that the tractor was able to pull it off the sand without any damage.

The Ferrari 458 Spider boasts a 4.5-litre V8 engine, an F1 dual clutch 7-speed transmission and an aluminium roof that can be retracted in 14 seconds.

The on-the-road price is £198,936 and is believed to be the first car ever to combine a mid-rear engine with a convertible roof.

Ferrari claims this is a key innovation that guarantees in-car comfort far superior to a traditional softtop, adding it has an 'extraordinarily fast deployment and retraction time and is far lighter and simpler than any package of its kind.
