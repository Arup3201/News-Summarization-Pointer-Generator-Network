Martin O’Neill hailed his ‘never say die’ players after the Republic of Ireland pulled off their second successive Euro 2016 escape act.

‘It’s a precious point and it might be vital at the end of the campaign,’ said O’Neill after John O’Shea’s 94th minute equaliser in Gelsenkirchen clinched a 1-1 draw and rocked world champions Germany.

A month after Aiden McGeady’s last gasp winner in Tbilisi, O’Shea, wearing the captains’ armband after Robbie Keane was substituted, gave his 100th appearance a gold-embossed crown.

‘To see John scoring, wearing the armband too, and it so late in the game, well it had everything,’ grinned O’Neill who has overseen an unbeaten start to Group D.

‘We’ve had two tough away games and we’ve got seven points. This result tonight keeps us going to next month when we play Scotland in Glasgow.’

‘It was a great point for us, in the context of coming to the home of the world champions and getting something from the game,’ said O’Neill.

‘I still feel Germany are the strongest team in the group,’ he added.

O’Neill felt his players deserved immense credit for their application, courage and deep reserves of self-belief as they climbed off the canvass to cancel out Toni Kroos’ opening goal in the 71st minute.

O'Neill believes his players were worthy of a point against Joachim Low's Germany side

‘We never gave up. It was a bit like Georgia. I never felt that we were out of the game despite their goal, which we should have done better with,' said O'Neill.

‘We were missing a couple of players too. And with respect, our injury blows would cause more problems than the German game.’

The result extended O’Neill’s remarkable career record against German opposition.

As a player, he captained Northern Ireland to victory, home and away, against West Germany in the 1984 European Championships.

He also won the European Cup twice, the first time on German soil, and the second against a German team, Hamburg.

On Tuesday night, he penned another chapter in his 35-year Germanic success story.

Joachim Low, the German coach, was clearly shook up by the dramatic ending which saw Germany, so long the hunters of world football, become the hunted.

Low was disappointed at his side's lack of concentration in the final stages of the Euro 2016 qualifier

‘It is extremely annoying for us not to have won the game,’ he sniffed.

‘Ireland basically had one single chance and in the final second of the game managed to equalise.

‘On the other hand if there’s anyone to blame, the blame has to be on us. ‘Something like that shouldn’t have happened in the dying seconds of the game.

‘We lost possession too easily, we misplaced passes, we passed too often back to (Manuel) Neuer.

‘Despite being 1-0 up we showed a lot of nervousness in the game, we stopped controlling the game and gave too many chances to the opponents.

‘We let them (Ireland) rise again,’ he stressed.

‘It was hellishly difficult against a team as defensively minded as Ireland. We created fewer chances than we did against Poland but we did at least score.’

The result has left Germany in a perilous position in Group D and Low needs to get the whip out.

‘We had hoped for more points getting out of October,’ he admitted.

‘Somehow it was we expected we would fall into a World Cup hole,’ he said.

‘You can see it in the players’ eyes; they are a little exhausted after long season, the World Cup, then a short pre-season.

‘There is a little bit missing from some of them but next year we will be better,’ he vowed.

With Poland and Scotland sharing four goals, O’Neill is where he wants to be for his emotive Glasgow reunion on November 14.

The stakes couldn’t he higher but the Irish squad have a wet sail at their back, and a manager whom they believe in at the helm.
