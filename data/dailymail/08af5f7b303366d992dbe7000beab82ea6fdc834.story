Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will be charged with 17 counts of murder, assault and a string of other offenses in the massacre of Afghan villagers as they slept, a U.S. official said today.

The charges were revealed as it emerged today that the soldier was accused of forcing a woman to grab his crotch, and beating up her boyfriend, in a second drunken assault in 2008.

The charges against Bales include 17 counts of murder, six counts of attempted murder, and six counts of aggravated assault, as well as dereliction of duty and other violations of military law, the official said on condition of anonymity because the charges had not been announced.

Accused: Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will be charged with 17 counts of murder, assault and a string of other offenses in the massacre of Afghan villagers

The 38-year-old soldier and 
father-of-two, who lives in Lake Tapps, Washington, will be charged with 
going on a shooting rampage in two villages near his Southern 
Afghanistan military post in the early hours of March 11, gunning down 
nine Afghan children and eight adults, and burning some of the victims' 
bodies.

The charges are to be read to Bales on Friday. He is being held in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and faces trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The killings were yet another blow to U.S-Afghan relations, following a series of missteps, including the accidental burning of Qurans, which prompted violent protests and revenge killings American troops in the war zone.

The brutal shooting rampage also prompted renewed debate in the United States about health care for the troops, who have experienced record suicide rates and high rates of post-traumatic stress and brain injuries during repeated deployments over a decade of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Bales was on his fourth tour of duty, having served three tours in Iraq, where he suffered a head injury and a foot injury.

His civilian attorney, John Henry Browne, has portrayed his client as a patriot, loving father and devoted husband who had been traumatized by a comrade's injury and sent into combat one too many times.

But details of a second incident 
involving alcohol and violence surfaced today in the background of 
the Army staff sergeant.

A
Pierce County Sheriff's Department incident report obtained by The 
Associated Press quoted a woman claiming that an 'extremely intoxicated'
Bales told her she was beautiful, then 'pulled her hand to his 
crotch' outside a Tacoma, Washington, bowling alley in 2008.

Myra
Jo Irish told the responding officer that when her boyfriend demanded 
an apology, Bales began punching and kicking him. When the boyfriend 
raised one leg to stop the kicking, Bales grabbed the leg and pushed him
to the pavement.

The report indicates that Irish, her boyfriend and Bales were drunk, to the point of mumbling and slurring their speech.

Details of the incident follow a report this week that Bales had been arrested in 2002 for a drunken assault of a security guard at a Tacoma casino.

U.S. military officials say Bales was drinking on a southern Afghanistan base before he crept away to two villages overnight March 11 and shooting his 17 victims - eleven of which belonged to one family.

The charge stemming from the casino incident was dismissed after Bales completed 20 hours of anger management training. Records show that Bales was not charged in the 2008 incident at the Paradise Bowl.

Irish today denied that she and her boyfriend were intoxicated at the time of the brawl. 'I was just basically in shock that some stranger would walk up and do that,' she said.

Irish added that Bales was with a group that pleaded with her not to file charges. They told her Bales was drunk and if she 'could be so kind' not to file an official report.

'His friend said he was married and in the service, and it would destroy him,' if she filed charges, Irish said.

Also in 2008, Bales 
was involved in a hit-and-run accident in which records show he ran 
bleeding in military clothes into the woods. He told police he fell 
asleep at the wheel and paid a fine to get the charges dismissed, 
according to court records.

In 1998, Bales was cited for possessing alcohol at a Florida beach, though the citation was later dropped.

It also emerged today that the U.S. military attempted to erase all references to the staff sergeant from the internet after his arrest – but failed.

The army waited six days before identifying Bales, while it tried to delete all mentions of his combat service – including photographs and a battle account - from the web, according to McClatchy Newspapers.

‘Protecting a military family has to be a priority,’ a Pentagon official told McClatchy. ‘I think the feeding frenzy we saw after his name was released was evidence that we were right to try.’

Bales joined the Army in 2001 after a Florida investment business failed and after he had worked with a string of securities operations. Bales and a broker at one company were hit in 2003 with a $1.5 million arbitration ruling after an elderly couple charged that their holdings were decimated.
