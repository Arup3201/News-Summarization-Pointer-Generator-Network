The man they call Bomber is recalling his part in the last FA Cup tie between West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City. He is picturing the coach journey through streets filled with people, the tense atmosphere and the celebrations that followed.

It is 47 years since Tony Brown sent a missile into the net to secure West Brom a 2-0 victory and propel his team to their most recent piece of major silverware.

That semi-final, in front of more than 60,000 fans, took place on April 27, 1968, at Villa Park, the stadium equidistant from these local rivals.

On Saturday they meet again, in the fourth round of the Cup at St Andrew’s; an encounter eagerly anticipated by both sets of supporters.

‘It brings back memories,’ says Brown. ‘Since the draw we’ve had Blues supporters saying they’ll get their own back for ’68 — they haven’t forgotten. The city is very excited.’

In a club-record 720 competitive matches between 1963 and 1980 Brown, now 69, scored a club-record 279 goals, despite operating in midfield. Perhaps none will be treasured more than his rocket at Villa Park.

‘Bobby Hope put me through at the edge of the box and I drilled an angled shot into the far corner. That settled it really,’ he says with the same straightness as the shot was hit. The late Jeff Astle, another legendary figure for the club, had scored the opener.

Brown adds: ‘We had a free-kick just outside the box. Bobby Hope touched the ball to me and I drove it. The keeper dived and saved it, but parried it out and Jeff followed it up.’

Astle also scored the only goal in the final at Wembley against an Everton side containing World Cup winners Alan Ball and Ray Wilson. Lifting that trophy remains perhaps the highest peak in the club’s history.

The win over Birmingham provided the perfect penultimate chapter. ‘It was a tremendous day,’ says Brown. ‘Especially because it was a local derby. It was a sell-out crowd and there was all the ballyhoo of knowing Wembley was the prize. It added an extra tingle to the game.

‘We all had to meet at The Hawthorns to get a coach that would drive us the short distance to Villa Park. We passed through swarms of fans lining the way. It is a tremendous ground.

‘Both sets of fans made the occasion. You could cut the atmosphere with a knife. We were nervous, too. I know we won 2-0 but they had better chances than us. Fred Pickering, their lad up front, had three or four but didn’t stick them away. Fortunately Jeff and I did.’

Brown says good fortune played a part throughout their run. ‘In the third round we had Colchester away. They scored first and I equalised with a penalty.

‘Then, with about three minutes to go, they scored again and we thought we were out. John Talbut, our big centre half, kicked the ball out of the ground in disgust. But the referee for some reason disallowed it. Even today our lads don’t know why. We got them back to our place and won comfortably.

‘In the next round we were losing at home to Southampton and I hit one from outside the box but never got a good connection. Their goalkeeper went down on one knee to collect but the ball hit a divot, bounced over his shoulder and into the back of the net. We could easily have gone out. When we beat Liverpool in the quarter-final after a second replay we really believed it would be our year.‘

Brown nearly missed the final with a thigh injury — ‘it was touch and go’ — but recovered and was able to enjoy the day he had dreamed of as a schoolboy.

‘The first thing we did was take the Cup straight in the bath and drink champagne from it,’ he says. ‘We stayed in London that night and went to the Astor Club, had a good sing-song. One thing that sticks in my mind was the manager Alan Ashman not letting the trophy out of his grasp.’

Brown knows Tony Pulis craves a similar scenario, even if Premier League survival is his primary mission. ‘He’s said a couple of times in interviews that he likes the FA Cup and wants to do well in it — that’s music to my ears. We’ve had one or two managers in the past who haven’t really bothered about it.

‘It has changed. The priority nowadays is to stay in the Premier League because that’s where all the money is — that didn’t come into the equation through the years I played. Cup games were something special.

‘The youngsters must get all these stories about Wembley from their parents and grandparents. I know it’s a long way off but it’s the dream the fans have — and players should as well.

‘I think it will be a really hard-fought game. Blues have picked up since Gary Rowett has come in. He’s put a bit of spirit back into them. He’ll be steaming into them, emphasising there is a big scalp here to be won.

‘I’m sure Tony will have the lads up for it. What I’ve noticed in these few games is that he plays every ball. His passion for the game is clear. You hope that gets through to the lads in the dressing room. I’m sure it does.’
