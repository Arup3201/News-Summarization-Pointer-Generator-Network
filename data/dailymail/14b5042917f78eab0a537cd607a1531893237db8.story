Some may dream of country mansions and huge yachts, but for the average Briton the cost of luxury is somewhat cheaper.

Most believe they could afford a life of luxury on £4,413 a month after tax and national insurance are deducted, a study found.

Although this would require an annual salary of more than £80,000 – which is more than three times the national average of £26,100 – it is a long way short of a tycoon’s earnings.

Just right: Most people think £1,922.75 a month is the amount needed for a comfortable lifestyle (file picture)

The poll of 2,000 people also revealed that most think they need a take-home income of £1,722 a month – £26,500 a year before tax and NI are deducted – to survive. They believe they could live comfortably on £1,922 a month – around £30,000 a year.

The study found that millions rank money more highly than friendship or their families.

Three out of ten said money was more important to them than their friends, while 28 per cent named it as more of a priority to them than spending time with their family.

More than one in four Britons considered it to be more important than job security, while 29 per cent think it is more significant than how happy they are in their career.

For a quarter of those polled, socialising with friends is the first thing to be sacrificed when money is tight.

Another one in ten save money by going out less with their partner while one in 20 spend less on their families.

'Extras': Gym memberships, charitable donations and new clothes were some of the first things to fall by the wayside for those on a budget (file picture)

Luxuries such as clothes and good food are the most common items to go when on a budget, while gym memberships and charitable donations also get the chop.

The research, commissioned by Skrill, an e-commerce business that facilitates online payments, found that more than one in five think cash will disappear over the next 20 years, with the internet and mobile phones being used for purchases instead.

Already, 30 per cent of people use their debit or credit cards to pay for every transaction, however small.

The survey follows David Cameron’s much-ridiculed £2million state research project into the nation’s ‘emotional’ wellbeing.

Last month it found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that those who have more money are generally a lot happier with their lives. But there is a ‘squeezed middle’ who appear slightly less happy than those lower down or higher up in the earnings table.
