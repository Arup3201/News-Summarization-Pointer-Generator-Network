A group of female NYPD officers are facing disciplinary action after photos of them in uniform were posted on sexy Instagram account.

The policewomen posted photos of themselves posing away from work alongside images of them wearing their badges - allegedly violating the department's social media policy.

The collection of shots, which have appeared alongside other officers from around the country, are then turning up on sites such as Blueline Beauties which describes itself as being: 'Dedicated to Law Enforcement Women'. 

One of the female officers posted a picture of herself with Santa Claus pin above her badge alongside one of her on a night out. They could face disciplinary action for violating NYPD social media policy 

The policewomen involved are allegedly breaking the department's social media regulations because they are uploading photos of themselves away from official ceremonies 

Those who want to be featured on the profile have to send in their pictures. 

One of officers had a Santa badge pinned above her suit with an accompanying snap of her wearing a tiny black dress, showing off a tattoo on her thigh. 

Another took a selfie while wearing uniform and sent it in along with a shot flaunting her cleavage and another pursing her lips while preparing for a night out.  

The New York Daily News reported that cops are not allowed to take photos of themselves in uniform and post them online unless they are at official ceremonies.  

The force began issuing guidelines for how officers should use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media sites in 2013.

An internal order revealed members of the nation's largest police department to be careful with what they reveal online.

It includes being vigilant when identifying themselves with the force.

The document stated that officers 'are to exercise good judgment and demonstrate professionalism expected of them while performing their official duties.' 

It also warns that 'personal social media sites may be used against them to undermine the credibility of the department, interfere with official police business, compromise ongoing investigations and affect their employment status.' 

 The cops could be punished as a result of the actions, with the severity ranging from the loss of vacation days to termination from the force 

The same year, Mail Online revealed that an investigation had begun into NYPD officers posing alongside force patrol cars and motorcycles on their dating profiles.

In a statement in response to the probe, John J. McCarthy, NYPD Deputy Commissioner, said: 'Members of the Police Department are prohibited from posting photographs of themselves in uniform without the prior authorization.

'This does not include photographs taken during official department ceremonies. This directive is in compliance with the New York City Social Media Policy and is in part intended to protect officers from divulging identifying information on social media sites that may endanger officer safety. 

Breach of these guidelines can result in harsh disciplinary action including termination. However sources told the Daily News that the female officers involved could lose 10 days vacation. 

It is unknown whether officers from other departments around the country could be punished as the policies vary between forces. 

According to the Baltimore Sun the city's police department do not regulate their use of social media.  

Cops from around the country, including this one from Baltimore PD, have also sent their pictures to the profile for them to be uploaded. Policies regarding social media vary between departments across the country
