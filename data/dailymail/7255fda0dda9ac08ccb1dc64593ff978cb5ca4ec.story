Despite ISIS wanting to introduce its own currency the terrorist group is offering to pay a cash reward for anyone who captures a Western spy - in American dollars. 

In a leaflet circulated via ISIS's social media accounts, the group offered to pay $5,000 to anyone who captures 'an agent of the crusaders' or provides information that leads to them finding a spy working for the West. 

The leaflet, published yesterday, is being disseminated in Syria's Aleppo province. 

Despite ISIS wanting to introduce its own currency the terrorist group is offering to pay a cash reward for anyone who captures a Western spy - in American dollars; the leaflet above offering the payment has been circulated via the terrorist group's media accounts

The leaflet reads that it is 'imperative for every Muslim' to help ISIS catch Western spies 

According to Vocative.com the leaflet reads: 'The crusaders and the Arab dictators are using agents and spies to plant electronic chips in places of the Mujahideen, in order to bomb them with the crusaders' coalition airstrikes. 

'Persecuting and bringing agents in is imperative for every Muslim.'

The website reports that the latest ploy by ISIS could be motivated by the success of several recent U.S. led airstrikes, including one that almost killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the town of al-Qaim, on the border between Iraq and Syria.

Earlier this month Mail Online revealed that ISIS wanted to introduce its own Islamic currency as part of its attempts to solidify its makeshift caliphate.

Militants were said to want to bring back the original dinar, which is an ancient currency from early Islam, and religious figures in Mosul and Iraq’s Nineveh province have apparently announced its return in mosques.

The currency known as the dinar, which once consisted purely of gold and silver coins, is today used by a variety of countries, but the coins are created from different materials to the originals.

However, the jihadi group is understood to be planning to return to the original gold and silver coins, which were first introduced during the Caliphate of Uthman in 634 CE. 

The original Islamic dinar was a gold coin which was the weight of gold equivalent to 4.3 grams. Its silver counterpart, known as the Islamic dirham, was a silver coin equal in weight to 3 grams of silver.

Both were round in shape and one side of the coin was typically stamped with an Islamic message, while the other featured the date of minting and the country’s ruler.

While ISIS has yet to confirm the introduction of its currency, social media is awash with claims that leading religious figures announced the plans during recent prayers in Mosul and Nineveh province.

It is believed ISIS wants to use the independent currency in areas it controls as part of its war on the West.

The currency, which could be introduced within the next few weeks, will involve changing from regular dinars and Lira to golden dinars and silver dirhams.

Last month, it emerged that ISIS is making about $1million a day from black market oil sales alone.

The group extracts oil from territory captured across Syria and Iraq, and sells it to smugglers.

David Cohen, who leads the Treasury Department's effort to undermine the Islamic State's finances, said the extremists also get several million dollars a month from wealthy donors, extortion rackets and other criminal activities, such as robbing banks.

In addition, he said the group has taken in at least $20million in ransom payments this year from kidnappings.
