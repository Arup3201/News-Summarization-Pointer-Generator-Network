World Cup winners Germany resume their qualifying campaign for Euro 2016 with a trip to Georgia on Sunday and Lukas Podolski was delighted to be back with his international team-mates at training on Monday.

Striker Podolski, who is on loan at Inter Milan from Arsenal, uploaded an image to Instagram alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger and Holger Badstuber, who has returned to the international fold after recovering from a long term thigh injury. 

'Happy reunion with DFB mates - even better with Holger being back!' Podolski wrote alongside the picture of the trio.

Germany have struggled to take their imperious World Cup form into qualifying for France 2016.

Joachim Loew's side are currently second in Group D with seven points from four games. Rivals Poland are the early pacesetters on 10 points.

But before Loew's team aim for three points against Georgia, they will take on Australia in a friendly, which promises to be a challenging fixture with the Socceroos riding the crest of a wave after their Asian Cup triumph in January. 

Oliver Bierhoff, first team caretaker for Germany, wants his team to return to their best over the course of the two matches.

'The aim is to qualify comfortably for the Euros,' Bierhoff said. 'We want to finish top of the group. The game against Australia will allow us to regain our momentum. 

'The aim is to win in Georgia, even thought it might be awkward playing against a supposedly small opposition.'

Bierhoff also praised Badstuber on his return to the international setup, who is back in the Germany squad alongside Ilkay Gundogan, who has had problems with a back injury.

'We’re very happy to have both players back,' Bierhoff said. 'It’s often the case that players come back even better after setbacks.'
