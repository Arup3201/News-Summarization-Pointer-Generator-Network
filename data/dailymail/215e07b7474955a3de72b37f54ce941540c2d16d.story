Warning: Lord Ashdown said today that British forces must withdraw from Afghanistan as quickly as possible before any more troops are killed

It is 'crystal clear' the war in Afghanistan is completely lost and is not worth wasting the life of one more British soldier, Lord Ashdown has said today.

In the 11-year-conflict 438 Britons have died and the former Liberal Democrat leader believes that our armed forces should 'get out now' to avoid any more bloodshed.

The Prime Minister wants to withdraw the 9,000 British troops by the end of 2014 as long as it fits with America's own plans.

But Lord Ashdown says it should be much sooner saying 'the longer it takes, the greater the sacrifice' as more deaths are not in battle, they are at the hands of members of the Afghan police or army.

Despite being trained by Allied forces traitors have killed 14 UK soldiers and 47 others so far this year.

'It is now crystal clear that we have lost in Afghanistan,' Lord Ashdown wrote in The Times today, adding: 'It is 
  not worth wasting one more life in Afghanistan.

'What can be done to stop Afghanistan internally unravelling into 
chaos has already been done. The only outcome of staying longer is more 
deaths for no purpose; most of them now caused not by the enemy in front of 
our troops, but by the enemy among them.'

The fourteen British troops who have been killed by their Afghan allies this 
year account for almost one in three of all fatalities in the country, which is 61.

The latest murder involved a British Army officer who was shot dead by an Afghan soldier as he played in a Remembrance Day football match.

Captain Walter Barrie, 41, from The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, was killed at Forward Operating Base Shawqat in the Nad-e Ali district.

Capt Barrie, from Glasgow, was shot when the traitor opened fire with an AK47 assault rifle as UK and Afghan forces took part in the kickabout.

The Ministry of Defence also confirmed that two troops shot dead last month – female Army medic Corporal Channing Day, 25, and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, a Royal Marine – were also killed by a renegade Afghan policeman.

A British Army commander also warned last month that the threat from inside will continue to increase.

Brigadier Doug Chalmers says a proportion of Afghan forces will always be unreliable, leading to calls that they should be better vetted.

Lord Ashdown says there is nothing that can be achieved in the war-torn country now.

'All that we can achieve has now been achieved,' Lord Ashdown wrote. 'All 
that we might have achieved if we had done things differently has been lost. 
The only rational policy is to leave quickly, in good order and in the 
company of our allies. This is the only cause for which further lives should 
be risked.

'We have succeeded in only one thing; albeit the big thing we first said we 
went to war for — driving out al-Qaeda. In almost all the other tasks we set 
ourselves, especially the establishment of a sustainable state, we have 
failed.'
