Gazing suggestively at the camera, Georgia May Jagger’s modelling campaign for Just Cavalli perfume certainly looks provocative.

However, it’s not the 22-year-old’s sultry pose that has triggered controversy, but the H-like symbol on her wrist.

The advert featuring the model daughter of Mick Jagger, part of a campaign by Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli, has been singled out by followers of a branch of Islam, who said it ‘cheapens’ and ‘degrades’ one of its holiest symbols.

Controversial: The Just Cavalli campaign sees Georgia May Jagger, 22, with an ornate H-like symbol on her wrist, and has prompted demonstrations by Sufi Muslims in London

The pictures of Georgia May – daughter of the Rolling Stones frontman, 70, and model Jerry Hall, 57 – have prompted demonstrations by Sufi Muslims in London, outside Harrods, as well as in Dusseldorf, Germany, and Los Angeles, since they were first released in the middle of last year.

The campaign – put together by Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli to promote a designer fragrance – shows Miss Jagger with an ornate H-like symbol on her skin.

It’s similar to a sign Sufis use to refer to Allah and representatives of the community have said it is ‘heartbreaking’ to see it used to make money.

There are an estimated 500,000 adherents of Sufism worldwide and they are demanding the symbol, which they have previously had trademarked, be removed from the adverts.

American student Nasim Bahadorani, one of the protest organisers, said: ‘To use something that means so much to us for corporate profit cheapens our sacred symbol. It’s disrespectful, offensive and degrading.

‘We have this sign that to us represents blessed peace. It’s a refuge. To see it disgraced like this for a company to make money is heartbreaking.’

Roberto Cavalli, which has used the image in campaigns since 2011, claims the symbols are not the same. It is a stance supported by the EU, which last month rejected a request by Sufi groups to ban the company from using the sign.

A spokesman for the fashion house said they are ‘deeply saddened by the distress expressed by’ the Sufi community but that they hope the EU ruling will ‘convince the Sufist religion of the complete good faith and the groundlessness of their requests’.

Despite the ruling, campaigners have kept up the pressure on social media using the hashtag ‘TakeOffJustLogo’ and have singled out Miss Jagger’s campaign, which includes a video where the model refers to the symbol as a ‘snakebite’ and a ‘sign of seduction’.

In a video produced by Sufi activists, which has been watched more than 12,000 times on YouTube, they accuse Robert Cavalli of ‘tearing communities apart’.

They pose the questions: ‘How long should people wait for action to be taken against the injustices witnessed around the world?

‘How long should we allow and tolerate Cavalli’s vindictive attack on faith by supporting and encouraging mistreatment of faith?’

This is not the first time Roberto Cavalli has run into trouble over the use of religious symbols.

Ten years ago, they made a line of bikinis which depicted Hindu gods.

The swimwear was stocked by Harrods but was pulled off the shelves after a backlash from faith groups.

The fashion house apologised at the time and said any offence was unintentional.

Miss Jagger has also modelled for brands including Chanel, Versace and Vivienne Westwood and appeared in the London Olympics Opening Ceremony as one of the representatives of British fashion, alongside Naomi Campbell, 44, and Kate Moss, 40
