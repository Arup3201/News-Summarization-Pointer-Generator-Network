Iraqis have endured their deadliest day of the year so far after a spate of bombings and shootings across the country claimed at least 103 lives.

Nearly 200 people were also injured in today's attacks which come days after a man purporting to be Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, warned that the militant group is reestablishing itself.

The outbreak of violence sent a 
chilling warning that militant organisation is slowly resurging in the security 
vacuum created since the departure of the U.S. military seven months 
ago.

The onslaught which took place in 13 Iraqi
cities and towns appeared coordinated: The blasts all happened within
a few hours of each other and they struck mostly at security forces and 
government officials - two of al-Qaida's favorite targets in Iraq.

'It was a thunderous explosion,' said Mohammed Munim, 35, who was working at an Interior Ministry office that issues government ID cards to residents in Baghdad's Shiite Sadr City neighborhood when a car exploded outside. Sixteen people were killed in the single attack.

'The only thing I remember was the smoke and fire, which was everywhere, said Munim from his bed in the emergency room at Sadr City hospital. He was hit by shrapnel in his neck and back.

The worst attack happened in the town of Taji, about 12 miles north of the capital. Police said bombs planted around five houses in the Sunni town exploded an hour after dawn, killing 17.

Officers who rushed to the scene to help were hit by a suicide bomber in the crowd, killing another 11.

And in a brazen attack on Iraq's 
military, three carloads of gunmen pulled up at an army base near the 
northeast town of town of Udaim and started firing at forces.

Thirteen soldiers were killed, and the gunmen escaped before they could be caught, two senior police officials said.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.

The overall toll made it the deadliest day in Iraq since U.S. troops left in mid-December.

Before today, the deadliest day was January 5, when a wave of bombings targeting Shiites killed 78 people in Baghdad and outside the southern city of Nasiriyah.

Last weekend in a statement that
was posted on a militant website Bakr al-Baghdadi said: 'The majority of the Sunnis in Iraq 
support al-Qaida and are waiting for its return.'

Iraqi militants have kept up a steady drumbeat of deadly attacks since the U.S. pulled out in December, ending nearly a decade of war.

'Al-Qaida is trying to send a message that it is still strong and can choose the time and places to attack,' said Shiite lawmaker Hakim al-Zamili, a member of parliament's security and defense committee.

He said weaknesses in Iraq's ability to gather intelligence about terror plots, or stop them despite security checkpoints has shown how toothless the government is in protecting its people.

Sectarian tensions have risen due to a political crisis stemming from terror charges the Shiite-led government has filed against one of the country's vice presidents, who is one of Iraq's top Sunni officials. He says they are politically inspired.Â
