Diego Costa is a major doubt for Chelsea's trip to Manchester United on Sunday after being taken to hospital with a mystery illness.

The £32m striker has not trained since returning from international duty with Spain and missed the win at Crystal Palace but his condition is improving following treatment in hospital.

The absence of Costa, who has scored 10 goals for club and country this season, is a big blow for Jose Mourinho ahead of the Old Trafford visit.

Costa also returned from Spain's Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg with a groin strain which could keep him out even if he recovers from the bug.

Mourinho is also without Loic Remy, who faces a fortnight on the sidelines after sustaining a groin injury in Chelsea's Champions League rout of Maribor on Tuesday.

It means the 36-year-old Didier Drogba could lead the Blues line against Louis van Gaal's team on Sunday.

Chelsea remain unbeaten this season and currently have a five-point lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League.
