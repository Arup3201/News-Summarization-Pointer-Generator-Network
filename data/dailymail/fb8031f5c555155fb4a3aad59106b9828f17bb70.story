Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has won a trophy in his first season at every club he's managed, except for AZ Alkmaar.

United lost 2-1 against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final on Monday night at Old Trafford, all but ending Van Gaal's search for silverware in his debut season in England.

Van Gaal won the Uefa Cup with Ajax in his first year, the La Liga title with Barcelona and the Bundesliga and DFB Cup with Bayern Munich previously.

United lost 2-1 against Arsenal as they must now concentrate on qualifying for the top four

The Dutchman's night only got worse on Monday as former United players showed what they were lacking at the Theatre of Dreams. 

Nani scored for Sporting Lisbon, Paul Pogba sent Juventus 11 points clear at the top of Serie A with a screamer, and it was Danny Welbeck who found the winner for Arsenal at Old Trafford.

United will now concentrate on finishing in the top four of the Premier League as they fight with Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton for Champions League qualification.
