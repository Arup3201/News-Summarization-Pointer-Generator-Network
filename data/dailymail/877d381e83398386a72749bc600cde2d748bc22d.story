Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has pledged to cover hundreds of miles this winter to gen up on the opposition as he strives to deliver League Two glory to Burton Albion.

The Dutchman achieved a winning start in his new job when the Brewers won 3-1 at Wycombe Wanderers in front of the Sky Sports cameras on Monday night.

And Hasselbaink, who says he is influenced by compatriots Louis van Gaal and Guus Hiddink, has pledged to make his team ‘as exciting as possible.’

Burton’s appointment of the former Leeds United and Chelsea striker raised a few eyebrows, especially since Hasselbaink has only one season of managerial experience under his belt - at Royal Antwerp in the Belgian second division.

But the 42-year-old is more than happy to work his way up from the bottom tier of the English Football League.

He said: ‘For me, it’s not about starting in League Two, League One, the Championship or the Premier League. It’s about the job, it’s about the project and where the club wants to go.

‘You look at the history, the people who run the club, the potential - those were the important bits, not that Burton are in League Two.

‘This is a club going in the right direction and I want to be part of that. I feel we are a good fit.’

Hasselbaink added: ‘I’m not too proud to work at this level - it’s still the same game. OK, it might be a bit different, but we are still here to win football matches and it’s about passion. I love football because of the passion, whatever the level.’

There was plenty of excitement around the former Premier League star trying his hand in the lower leagues

That passion will see Hasselbaink cover the length and breadth of the country over the coming weeks and months to ensure Burton can maintain and perhaps improve on their current fourth position in the table.

‘If we are not playing and future opponents have a game, I will drive hundreds of miles to go and watch them if necessary,’ he said.

‘And I would do that if I was working in the Championship, or at the majority of Premier League clubs, as well. It’s just part of the job. Maybe the Premier League is a bit different because every game is on TV.

‘I have been at clubs with two analysts instead of the one we have at Burton; and we have one scout for every three or four that other clubs might have.

‘It’s the detail where things are just a little different, but that doesn’t matter - it is what it is, and I’m ready for it.’

We saw a first glimpse of the type of football Hasselbaink’s Burton will be playing when they cruised to a 3-1 win over fellow promotion contenders Wycombe at Adams Park and it is clear a philosophy is taking shape.

Hasselbaink said: ‘Every manager you have played under or worked for, you learn from them all. There are always things you like and, sometimes, things you don’t like, but you use them to your benefit.

‘I’m very fond of Steve McClaren (they worked together at Nottingham Forest), I’m fond of Louis van Gaal, Guus Hiddink, the list goes on. I’m very fortunate, I’ve worked with some top managers.

‘We’re going to try to be as exciting as possible. I like my team to be positive, whatever that is, and there’s still a lot of work to be done. But I do have a good group to work with here, and they are willing to learn.’

Hasselbaink only had the luxury of three training sessions to prepare his team for the trip to Wycombe and the fixture list doesn’t get any easier. 

They welcome current league leaders Luton to the Pirelli Stadium on Saturday and then travel to second-placed Shrewsbury next weekend.
