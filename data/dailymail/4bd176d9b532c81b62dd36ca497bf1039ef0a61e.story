Purposeful pregnancy: Janet Vertesi actively tried to keep any mentions of her pregnancy offline to prove a point about invasive internet marketers

A sociology professor has taken her latest lesson out of the classroom by actively trying to keep her internet browser from figuring out she was pregnant in order to avoid marketing schemes.

Janet Vertesi is a sociologist with a focus on science and technology at Princeton University and she actively fought to keep her pregnancy from the internet.

She avoided buying anything on the internet and called her friends and relatives to tell them the news of her pregnancy rather than announcing it on Facebook or via email.

In the call, she told all of her friends and family about the project and urged them to keep all of their upcoming comments on her social media accounts free of any baby mentions.

One uncle failed to follow the rules, and prompted got un-friended.

She spoke about the experience at a technology conference in Brooklyn on Friday, telling how she has 'a very personal perspective of what it takes to avoid being collected, being tracked and being placed into databases'.

Ms Vertesi's experiment wasn't motivated by a vendetta against federal privacy infringement, but rather the invasive marketing tactics used by firms who use internet data collection as a way to predict spending patterns.

'This became especially important in my life about nine months ago because pregnant women, as you may know, are incredibly valuable to digital marketing databases,' she said at the Theorizing The Web conference, according to Mashable.

Cash only: She and her husband avoided online shopping, but some purchases couldn't be stopped, and in those instances they used cash to buy Amazon gift cards that were not associated with their names or addresses

Her ideas about the value of pregnant mothers to marketers is based in facts, as an average non-pregnant person's data is worth 10 cents to marketers, while the identity and information about a pregnant woman is $1.50.

'This is because we are making decisions for the first time about particular kinds of consumption patterns that are going to dictate our lives for the next number of years,' Ms Vertesi said.

Prenatal items and maternity wear were all purchased in cash, in person, and though she and her husband tried to do that throughout the nearly nine months that the experiment has gone on for, some things were unavoidable.

For the instances where online was the only option, they purchased Amazon gift cards in cash and then used the coupon codes to purchase baby-centric items online.

Valuable: Internet marketing firms are able to sell data about pregnant women to interested companies for 150% more than their non-pregnant counterparts

As an extra precaution, they had said items shipped to a specially-purchased locker so that it couldn't be connected to her real address.

When her husband went to get upwards of $500 in Amazon gift certificates to purchase their stroller, they ran into some slight legal trouble when he realized that New York laws dictate that Rite Aid has to report the 'excessive transactions' to the authorities since it is a practice associated with shadier dealings.

Another darker twist came when she turned to Tor, an untraceable internet browser that has been associated with illegal dealings like that of drug dealers or bitcoin exchanges.

'Those kinds of activities, when you take them in the aggregate ... are exactly the kinds of things that tag you as likely engaging in criminal activity, as opposed to just having a baby,' she said.
