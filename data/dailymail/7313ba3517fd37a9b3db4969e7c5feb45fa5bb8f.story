Murdered: The Facebook profile picture of Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, who was stabbed to death at a house party

A schoolgirl was yesterday stabbed to death during a house party thrown by a teenage boy whose parents were on holiday.

The 15-year-old girl, named locally as Megan Peat, was declared dead by emergency services at about 1.30am.

Neighbours claim they saw a man covered in blood with a partially severed finger running from the semi-detatched house after the attack.

Minutes later police arrested a 19-year-old man in a nearby street on suspicion of murder.

Officers were last night trying to contact the parents of the boy who had held the party.

A woman living near the scene in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, told how she found the tyres of her blue Vauxhall Astra spattered with blood.

'My neighbour who knows the family involved said it was a 15-year-old girl who had been stabbed.

'The
parents of the boy are currently away on holiday. I had heard that 
there were several youngsters in the house and they had earlier been in 
the cellar bar at the White Hart pub smoking dope.

'At some point they must have gone back to the house and that's when it happened.

'I think the blood on my car came from the boy as he was fleeing,' she said.

Another neighbour, who also wanted to
remain anonymous, said: 'The family moved in about four months ago. 
They are a couple aged in their 40s and their son, who I would say is in
his late teens.

'They seemed like quite normal people. I had seen the boy outside doing the garden.

'My
husband did hear something last night, but it wasn't that unusual 
because over the last couple of weeks there have been a number of 
parties at that house.

'Nothing too raucous, the sort you would expect when you have a son in his late teens.

'I don't know whether the boy works or goes to college but I have seen him about, walking a dog,' she said.

Friends of Megan, a pupil at Harlington Upper School in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, paid tribute to her yesterday.

Lou Baxter wrote on Twitter: 'Sleep tight beautiful. You'll never be forgotten. How someone could do that to you?'

Armani Moore write: 'RIP beautiful Megan Peat. You will always be in our hearts.'

James Cammack write: 'RIP Megan Peat. Sick people in our world. Too young to die.'

Emergency: police and paramedics were called to the house at around 1.30 this morning

Logan Hall said: 'My thoughts and respect are with Megan Peat's family at this sad time. RIP Megan.'

It
was understood that when paramedics arrived at the house, Megan was 
unconscious and not breathing, after suffering a full cardiac arrest. 
She was certified dead at the scene. The paramedics left her body for a 
police surgeon and pathologist to examine.

Sources said that the victim and the arrested youth knew each other but they were not related.

A
murder investigation, led by Detective Superintendent Martin Brunning 
on behalf of the Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire Major 
Crime Unit, was immediately launched following the girl's death.

A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: 'We have begun a murder investigation after a woman died from serious injuries earlier today.

'Officers attended the scene where a body was discovered and Scenes of Crime Officers are now undertaking a full forensic examination of the area,' said the spokesman.

'A 19-year-old man has been arrested in connection with this incident. No further information relating to the victim is available at this time.'

It was understood that a pathologist had been called in to carry out a post mortem examination to ascertain the exact cause of the woman's death.

The arrested teenager was being held in police cells but was not expected to be interviewed by detectives until later in the day.Â
