A Colorado man asked Meghan McCain out on Reddit – and she said yes.

Propositioning the buxom blonde during her Reddit Ask Me Almost Anything (AMAA) Friday, Luke Carey scored a date with the daughter of a former presidential candidate.

The majority of Ms McCain’s AMAA centered around politics, the environment and legalizing marijuana, but the digital Don Juan kept his eye on the prize.

Mr Carey didn’t beat around the bush either.

‘I genuinely think we’d have a great time on a date. Sushi and beer next time you’re in Denver?’ He asked.

Ms McCain tried to give herself some wiggle room by saying she only dates guy between 29 and 45-years-old.

‘Perfect,’ Carey replied. ‘I’m 30. It’ll kick ass.

The blogger/reality show star then agreed to the date, saying ‘it’s on like Donkey Kong' and plans to have dinner with the senior recruiter for a medical personnel firm the next time she's in Denver.

Not content to take just one yes for an answer, Mr Carey followed up the budding romance by tweeting a picture of himself to Ms McCain with the caption ‘Get excited!’

Ms McCain, the daughter of Senator John McCain, conducted the AMAA to promote RaisingMcCain, her new reality talk show premiering Saturday night on the recently-launched Pivot network.
