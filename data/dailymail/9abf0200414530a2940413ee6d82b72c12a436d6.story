These are the shocking images which show how public housing commission tenants are leasing their properties to pocket some extra cash and then trashing them in the process.

In an investigation by Nine Network's A Current Affair on Tuesday night, it was revealed that a number of public housing homes have illegally been placed on the rental market.

Housing commission tenant Tammy Kenyon, from Geelong in Victoria - who also goes by the online alias 'Holdenchick Kenyon' - has been caught acting as a landlord while advertising her property on Facebook.

Records of conversations on Facebook and text messages between Ms Kenyon and potential tenants for her housing commission property have been released, showing how she's targeted vulnerable families who are desperate for a new home.

Other public housing properties, including ones in Melbourne and Adelaide, are also believed to be leased out.

Ms Kenyon is  under investigation from the department of housing after she was found to be sub-letting her public housing property and pocketing the cash.

The Salvation Army granted Tammy Kenyon and her partner Jamie Hutchinson a commission home in the southern suburb of Belmont last year.

The mother-of-three was exposed after advertising the property and rental prices on her Facebook page.

'Three bedrooms, large yard, carpet all the way through, kitchen, bathroom and laundry have lino, $280 a week, $600 bond,' one of the posts reads.

In another, she claimed to sympathise with the would-be tenant about knowing what it’s like to be without a home.

'If you want to make easy [sic] for you I can make bond 300 as I know what it [sic] like to be homeless.'

The messages show how Ms Kenyon requested the money to be transferred into her account, then pocketed the cash without ever planning to move out of the property.

It is believed a number of different tenants have lived in this housing commission property

In a separate case, housing trust tenant Hayden Patterson has been caught advertising a spare room in his property in Goodward - south of Adelaide - for $65 a night on tourist accommodation website AirBnB.

The advertisement further stated the bedroom could sleep up to six guests for a minimum of two nights for about  $350, The Advertiser reports.

With the consent of Housing SA, trust tenants are allowed to lease out a room however they could not confirm whether permission had been granted to Mr Patterson. 

In Melbourne, residents have alerted authorities of a housing commission property, which has turned into a dump, after its tenant vacated the home so he can rent it out.

Single mother Leonie O'Connor has told of how she fell victim to Ms Kenyon's scam after getting repeated burglaries at their family home.

Ms O'Connor is particularly desperate to move out of her current home as her two special needs children have been attacked and bullied.

She paid a $400 bond, but became suspicious when she noticed the home was still being promoted on Facebook.

'She spent my bond money and I don't think I am ever going to get it back,' Ms O'Connor said.

'Sometimes I feel like I want to break down and cry but I want to stay strong for my kids.'
