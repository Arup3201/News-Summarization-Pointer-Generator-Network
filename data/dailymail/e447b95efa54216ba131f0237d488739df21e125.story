It may not leave James Bond shaken and stirred but this Aston Martin DB6 is set to sell for more than £400,000 - despite being an estate car rather than a sleeker number.

Only six of the models were ever produced after Aston Martin boss David Brown wanted a sports car with room for his shotguns and dogs to take on his regular hunting trips.

His team of designers came up with the 1965 Aston Martin DB6 Vantage Shooting Brake.

The rare Aston Martin, converted into an estate car, is up for sale at a Florida auction house this week

The car was designed by Aston Martin after the company's boss David Brown wanted a sports car that had room for his shotguns and dogs

Mr Brown wanted a car that he could take to the country for hunting - and coachbuilders Radford & Co converted only six DB6s into spacious vehicles

Bespoke coachbuilders Radford & Co then converted the six Aston Martin DB6s into the longer and larger versions of the vehicle.

Although the front looks like a classic Aston Martin, its rear end is large and practical with plenty of space in the boot.

Now the car is worth twice as much as its DB6 cousin.

It has air conditioning and has powerful and superior Vantage specifications.

The Aston Martin, which has an all-aluminium straight six engine, will be auctioned by Bonhams auctioneers in Florida this week.

The car is believed to have been ordered in 1967 or 1968 by a James Harrison, of Madison Avenue, New York, which is why it is a left hand drive.

A Bonhams spokesman said: 'This DB6 was clearly used in the UK as it carried a British registration.

'Close inspection of the car reveals a remarkably original and unspoilt car.

A DB6 complete with roof rack is an unusual find - hence the expected sale price of £400,000

The original leather interior is still intact in this customised left hand drive

It may not be as sleek as the more familiar Aston Martin, but being only one of six, it's worth twice as much as its cousins

'The original leather beige interior remains in place and from stem to stern the car has the feeling of being as it was when its conversion was finished, complete with period luggage rack on its roof.

'As Aston Martin values continue to escalate, it is the rarest variants that are the most sought-after and in that respect, they don't come much better than this.

'Vantage, air-conditioning, left hand drive and with space to actually carry a decent sized picnic or hunting equipment this ultra rare Shooting Brake will stand out from the crowd.'

The Aston Martin goes under the hammer at Bonhams in Boca Raton, Florida, on February 23.
