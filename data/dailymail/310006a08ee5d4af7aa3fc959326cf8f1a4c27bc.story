A newborn orangutan cuddles up and nestles in its mother’s arms as it enjoys a nice snooze in the sunshine.

The little ape, less than a month old, appears to content in its mothers strong arms.

The 18-year-old mother, Mali, poses for the camera with her baby at her home at Devon's Paignton Zoo.

It was the first birth at the zoo for 18 years and workers are confident that the baby ape is a girl.

Phil Knowling, a spokesperson for the zoo, said the the pair are doing well after the birth.

He said: 'We are pretty sure it’s a girl. Keepers are 99.9 per cent sure that the baby, now a month old, is female.

'Mali and the baby are doing well. They have the largest of the orangutan islands and even have an off show den to themselves.

On the brink: Orangutans are at risk because of human encroachment into their territory, notably by palm oil producers

'We hope that visitors will be able to catch a glimpse of the youngster, which will become more mobile over the coming months.'

The pair are Bornean orangutans and they have suffered declines where the population is estimated to just be 50,000.

The baby will remain with its mother for up to 10 years - before it might move to another zoo as part of the European Endangered Species Programme.

The expansion of oil palm plantations into high conservation value forests in their natural habitat is recognised as a leading threat to critically endangered species including orangutans, elephants and tigers.

As well as being cute, the baby girl will most likely be smart too - orangutans are regarded as the most intelligent of the primates.

They are known for being able to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools and make elaborate nests to sleep in. Experts have extensively studied the species for their learning capability.

Bornean orangutans, which are native to the island of Borneo, belongs to the only genus of great apes native to Asia. They share around 97 per cent of their DNA with humans.

Bornean orangutans live in tropical and subtropical forests in lowland and mountainous areas of Borneo. The species lives in the tree canopy and moves large distances in search of food.

As well as the destruction of their natural habitat, they are also killed for the 'bushmeat trade,' while young orangutans are sometimes caught to be sold as pets.

Around 55,000 Borean orangutans live in the wild, and a number are in preservation programmes throughout the world
