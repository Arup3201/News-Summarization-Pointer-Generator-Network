A seven-year-old girl has become one of the 
first children in the UK to have stem cells banked using her baby teeth - after they were
extracted by her dentist father.

Becca Graham’s parents Callum and 
Heather decided to freeze and store their daughter’s milk teeth so the 
youngster can take advantage of future medical advances in stem cell 
research.

Stem cells from bone marrow and 
umbilical cord blood have been used for decades to treat leukaemia and 
other blood-related diseases.

Teeth are an 'incredible source' of stem
cells, Mr Graham said, and researchers are studying how they could be 
used to treat a number of diseases and conditions including diabetes, 
spinal cord injuries, stroke and liver problems.

Becca, who lives in East Kilbride, South
Lanarkshire, had her two wobbly front teeth removed by her father at 
his Glasgow dental practice Queens Drive Dental.

The dental pulp from the milk teeth will be collected, frozen and stored for 30 years or more until needed.

Becca said the extraction was 'a little bit sore' but that her real concern was about the tooth fairy.

'I wrote a wee letter to her to explain and she sent me back £5,' she said.

Doctors have already used dental cells 
to regenerate dental bone and treat periodontal disease, said Mr Graham.

The dentist and his wife started to 
think about banking stem cells around the time of Becca’s birth but were
too late to arrange for cells to be taken from the umbilical cord.

They got the idea of using their daughter’s teeth after seeing a leaflet for cell banking company Precious Cells at the surgery.

Father-of-three Mr Graham said: 'There’s
been an awful lot of research lately regarding stem cells and how to 
deliver them and use them to cure diseases, leukaemia, diabetes and 
cancers. We had been looking for a way to store stem cells when Rebecca 
was born. We’d heard all about it and thought it was a good idea.

'Although there’s not a lot of 
treatments just now, we knew there was a future in it, in personalised 
bio-technology, where everybody cures themselves. It’s a fabulous 
service to be able to offer your children.

'Becca was brilliant. We explained the relevance of it, why we were going to take her tooth and she was a brilliant patient.

'It’s always a little bit nerve-wracking
treating members of your family or your friends. You feel a great deal 
of empathy with them, as you do with all your patients, but more so with
people you know.'

Mrs Graham, who works as an 
administrator for the surgery, said: 'I knew I wanted to keep her teeth 
to bank them because with the progress that science has made now, and 
the things that stem cells can do at the moment, who knows what it’s 
going to be like in 10 years, 20 or 30 years.

'It’s such a gift to be able to give your child. We told her that inside her tooth 
there are cells and they’ll go underground in a big freezer, and if ever
she needs an operation or if something happens, her cells are there to 
make her better.

'The only thing she was worried about was the tooth fairy.'
