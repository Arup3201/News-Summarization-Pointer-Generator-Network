A science question asking whether a woman named LaShamanda would pass on her 'big bootie' to her daughter has been removed from lessons after parents said it was racist.

Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, featured a genetics question in which students were asked to work out the likelihood of a child - LaPrincess - getting 'her mama's big bootie'.

Outraged parents question seized upon the question's language, which they said uses racial stereotypes and belittles black people, causing school authorities to withdraw it from tests.

'Racist' question: The item, above, from a genetics quiz, asked students in Charlotte, North Carolina, to work out the likelihood of LaPrincess - daughter to LaShamanda and 'her man' Fontavius - getting a 'big bootie'

The question, reported by WBTV, was designed to tests whether the students could understand the difference between a dominant trait, which parents are likely to pass on, and a recessive one, which they are not.

It begins: 'LaShamanda has a heterozygous big bootie, the dominant trait. Her man Fontavius has a small bootie which is recesiive. They get married and have a baby named LaPrincess.'

After asking students to show their workings, two questions were asked:

The mother of an Ardrey High student said: 'This is not appropriate language at all for the children in the school'.

A father whose child goes to the school said: 'It's racist - absolutely - and stereotypical.'

An initial response to a parent who complained from an Ardrey High teacher apologized for the offence - but attempted to justify its inclusion by saying students could skip the question and choose another.

However, after renewed complaints the school district distanced itself from the question and said it would be pulled.

A statement from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS), which operates Ardrey High, said: 'The worksheet does not appear to be a document created by CMS.

'The school has taken the worksheet out of circulation and requested its teachers to discontinue using it.'
