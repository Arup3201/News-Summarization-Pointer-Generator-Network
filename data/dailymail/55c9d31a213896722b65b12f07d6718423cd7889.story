Coca-Cola has taken over Innocent after the ethical smoothie maker's young founders decided to sell up their remaining stakes for a dizzying £100million, according to reports.

The fizzy drinks empire, which already owned 58 per cent of Innocent, snapped up the shareholdings of founders Richard Reed, Adam Balon and John Wright in a deal that gives Coca Cola at least 90 per cent ownership and values Innocent in the region of £320million.

The brand’s creators
 - Cambridge graduates who first sold their smoothies 15 years ago from a music festival stall - will give up day-to-day management responsibilities in May, but they 
will remain on the executive committee and insisted the brand's ethic would not be compromised by the takeover.

Innocent was founded in 1998 to capitalise on the growing market for healthy drinks and smoothies.

Mr Reed, 36, Adam Balon, 37, and Jon Wright, 36, who had all been friends at Cambridge, initially bought £500 of fruit to make smoothies at the Jazz on the Green festival in Parsons Green, south-west London.

Customers told them the drinks were so good they should leave their jobs in management consultancy and advertising to set up Innocent.

By 2007, Innocent had cornered the smoothie market and made a profit of £8million, but a year later provoked controversy after selling an 18 per cent stake to Coca-Cola for £30million.

In 2010, Coca Cola bought out original backer Maurice Pinto and his friend Jules Hydleman, who first invested £250,000 
into the business, paying another £65million to increase its ownership 
to 58 per cent.

One pot at a time: Innocent first launched its healthy veg pot range in September 2008

Stay smooth: Innocent is most famous for its range of fruit smoothies but in more recent years it has branched out to launch a juice and healthy veg ready meal range.

Neither firm has disclosed the exact valuation of the deal announced by Coca-Cola today,

Innocent has doubled its sales to £209million since first striking a
 deal with Coca-Cola and a report in the Financial Times last week claimed 
that Innocent is now worth £100million.

In
 anticipation of a backlash from those who value the Innocent image and 
reputation, co-founder Richard Reed, said: ‘Innocent has flourished 
since our deal with Coca-Cola four years ago.

'They have been hugely supportive of 
our mission of getting natural, healthy foods to more people and have 
been 100 per cent committed to protecting our brand and the values it 
stands for.' 

'Given
 the success of the relationship, they will be increasing their 
investment, supporting even more innovation and international expansion.

'Importantly for us, the business will be run by a home-grown innocent 
team in the same unique innocent way, with the founders remaining 
involved to support the business in the years ahead.’

Innocent
 launched thirteen years ago to sell natural healthy products and has 
grown to stock products in 15 countries and employs 250 people across 
Europe.

The firm is most famous of its range 
of fruit smoothies but in more recent years it has launched successful 
juice and healthy vegetable ready meal lines.

Richard Reed said that Innocent would continue to be run by its own team as well as James Quincey, who already runs the Coca-Cola business in Europe.

James Quincey said: ‘Our relationship with innocent continues to flourish and our investment has fuelled the business’s expansion.

'We remain confident in the long-term growth potential of the company and the team and consider the brand values as fundamental to continued success.

'We are excited about the future and getting innocent’s products to more people in more countries with the valuable input and continued support of the founders.’
