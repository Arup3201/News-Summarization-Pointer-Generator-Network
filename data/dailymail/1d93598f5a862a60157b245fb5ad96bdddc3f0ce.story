Jose Mourinho wants to keep out-of contract trio John Terry, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole at Chelsea.

‘Was the Norwich game the last game for Cole, Lampard and Terry? I don’t think so,’ said Mourinho.

The Chelsea boss is also recommending the permanent return of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who has spent the previous three seasons at Atletico Madrid, as part of his comprehensive end-of-season report for owner Roman Abramovich.

Uncertain future: John Terry earned a new contract, but Cole and Frank Lampard are yet to receive an offer

The file, which Mourinho will submit on Monday, contains his vision for next season and addresses the futures of strikers Samuel Eto’o, Demba Ba, Fernando Torres and Romelu Lukaku, who is on loan at Everton.

‘I’ve been doing a report for a long time,’ said Mourinho. ‘I’ll give it in on Monday. After that we meet and address these cases. I always do it because it’s the way I like to do things. I always do written reports from the manager to the board. 

‘I do that during the season and with a final report at the end of the season where I try to have my point of view, my analysis on every aspect of the season, and every aspect of the club relating to the first-team.

‘I’m the manager. I have an opinion. I inform the club about my opinion; not just a simple comment made in a corridor, in a proper way, to be committed with my opinions, and I do that in writing, always. That’s the proper way to do it officially.

‘That’s my job. My job is to analyse things, to have opinions, and make my decisions. After that the club is the club and obviously I have to work for and with the club, and respect the club’s decisions.’

On the futures of Belgian duo Courtois and Lukaku, Mourinho continued: ‘Have I made a decision on Courtois for next season? Yes — but I’m not the club.

‘It was a successful loan for Thibaut, a long loan in this case. Lukaku had a successful loan, too.

‘Sometimes the players go on loan and we cannot find a positive reason for that loan at the end of the season.

‘But Lukaku has played all the time, had minutes of experience in a good team with a good coach, scoring his goals.

‘So he’s a successful case of loans and those are the ones we have to analyse.’

Ryan Bertrand could leave Chelsea this summer after talks with Mourinho. The left-back, 24, wants regular game time. ‘To go back next year to Chelsea and sit on the bench is not what I want,’ Bertrand said.

‘If I was to leave I want to stay within the best teams in the Premier League. To keep my own ambitions to progress and play for England I need to be right up there, playing consistently at a decent level.’
