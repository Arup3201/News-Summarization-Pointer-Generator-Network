Benetton have again risked the fury of world leaders by unfurling a billboard ad in one of Israel's biggest cities showing its prime minister kissing his long-time enemy, the president of neighbouring Palestine.

The high-impact image of Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas puckering up is part of the Italian clothing label's controversial advertising campaign, Unhate, which was launched less than a fortnight ago.

It has already received plenty of 
attention, but the installation of one of the series' most provocative 
images in Tel Aviv may cause an even stronger reaction.

Political pout: Workers unfurl a billboard ad in Tel Aviv showing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kissing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas

Friendly: The doctored image in the Benetton advert is likely to upset many people in the Israeli city

The doctored photographs have already
caused outrage across the world, with the Vatican insisting the 
'disrespectful' picture of the Pope kissing an Egyptian imam was 
withdrawn from the campaign.

Now the politically daring fashion firm are 
displaying their forthright message of acceptance on a giant billboard 
in the heart of a country long troubled by its difficult relations with 
Palestine.

The move follows Benetton's 
humiliating climbdown on the day of the launch when the company was 
forced to pull one of its images.

The Italian firm withdrew the 
photograph featuring Pope Benedict XVI kissing a senior Egyptian imam on
the lips after the Vatican denounced it as unacceptable.

Controversial: This mocked-up image of the Pope embracing Ahmed Mohamed el-Tayeb as part of Benetton's new advertising campaign has been called 'totally unacceptable' by the Vatican

Edgy: Benetton's Unhate Campaign includes this picture of U.S. President Barack Obama and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez kissing

Mocked-up: Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel in a clinch with French president Nicolas Sarkozy

Benetton
had claimed the campaign was aimed 
at fostering tolerance and 'global love', but would have known how much 
trouble they were likely to stir up.

The digitally altered pictures 
include U.S. President Barack Obama kissing Venezuela's socialist leader
Hugo Chavez and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il locking lips with South
Korean President Lee Myung-bak.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 
French president Nicolas Sarkozy also take time out from dealing with 
the financial crisis engulfing Europe to give each other a smacker.

But it is the shot of His Holiness 
planting a kiss on Sheik Ahmed el-Tayeb of Cairo's al-Azhar institute, 
the pre-eminent theological school of Sunni Islam, that raised the 
strongest objections.

It pulled from Benetton's website on the day of the launch about an hour after the Vatican's protest.

Combating hatred: Benetton hope the controversial images will help create tolerance around the world. This picture shows China's leader Hu Jintao and Barack Obama

Enemies: North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Lee Myung-bak, President of South Korea, are unlikely to be keen on this picture

Al-Azhar suspended interfaith talks 
with the Vatican earlier this year after Benedict called for greater 
protections for Egypt's minority Christians.

Images were unfurled in Milan, New York, Paris, Tel Aviv and Rome, but a large banner of the image has been removed from a spot near the Vatican.

Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico 
Lombardi called the ad an 'unacceptable' manipulation of the pope's 
likeness that offended the religious sentiments of the faithful.

'It shows a serious lack of respect for the Pope,' Lombardi said.

Shock ads have long been a part of 
Benetton's publicity strategy, with photographer Oliviero Toscani's 
famous campaigns featuring death row inmates and people dying of AIDS.

Benetton said the photographs of 
political and religious leaders kissing were 'symbolic images of 
reconciliation - with a touch of ironic hope and constructive 
provocation - to stimulate reflection on how politics, faith and ideas, 
when they are divergent and mutually opposed, must still lead to 
dialogue and mediation.'

In a statement, the Treviso-based manufacturer said: 'We are sorry that the use of an image of
the pontiff and the imam should have offended the sensibilities of the 
faithful in this way. We have decided with immediate effect to withdraw 
this image from every publication.'

According to the Wall Street Journal,
Alessandro Benetton, deputy chairman of Benetton Group SpA and son of 
the founder of the family-controlled company, said: 'It means not 
hating.

'In a moment of
darkness, with the financial crisis, what's going on in North African 
countries, in Athens, this is an attitude we can all embrace that can 
have positive energy.'
