Desperate: Jobless Martin Bailey from Nottingham who has resorted to wearing with a sandwich board to try and attract potential employers

There's no doubt that many people are finding landing a job difficult in the current economic climate.

But one down-on-his-luck job hunter is resorting to desperate measures in a bid to find work and avoid claiming benefits.

Martin Bailey, 50, has taken to standing on a busy roundabout each morning wearing a sandwich board asking for someone to employ him.

He hopes that his unorthodox way of looking for an income will not only win him a job but also help him win back the love of his life with whom he split last year because he was unable to offer her a stable life.

The divorced father-of-two dresses in his suit and heads out in Nottingham each day wearing the board which reads: 'Quality worker seeks job; honk if you can help'.

Dedicated Martin, who worked for more than two decades as a civil servant at the Land Registry until he was made redundant last year, has gone the extra mile in his bid to get a new job after dozens of application forms and more than 50 speculative CVs failed to find him work.

He even attempted to set up his own business in an attempt to make an honest crust, running a fancy dress store until it was forced to close on Saturday due to a lack of business.

He said: 'I was made redundant a year ago from my job in the civil service. So I used the money to set up my own business.

'But it was a struggle since the day we opened and I had to shut up shop last Saturday.

'Unfortunately the day we opened a massive fancy dress centre opened in the city centre and, while our business did gradually improve, we just didn't get the visitors in.

'I don't want to be unemployed and I don't want to claim benefits.

Hopeful: Martin Bailey says that the response to his quest for work has been positive so far and that he has handed out business cards to several motorists

Out of luck: Martin hopes to find work after closing his business on Saturday. He is also looking to win back the love of his life by offering her 'something stable'

'I hate the idea of not being productive, I'm prepared to do anything, I'd love to do customer services but I can do driving jobs, admin, and jobs with anti-social hours don't bother me.

'I thought I would show my initiative, get up first thing in the morning in the cold and get myself out there rather than standing in the dole queue.

'I felt a bit stupid to start with and it was bitterly cold, but I handed out at least half a dozen business cards yesterday and hopefully this will all end in a job.

'So far I've had a great response, loads of people honking so it's pretty loud round there, but I've been given some fantastic business cards by people who want my CV and like my pro-activeness.'

Martin is also determined to get back on his feet in order to win back a woman he broke up with last year.

Graduate Adam Pacitti also went to drastic measures in a bid to get a job, spending his last £500 on this billboard

He added: 'I do have another slight push to do this, I met the love of my life last year called Joan and we split because I couldn't offer her anything stable.

'I am hoping that if I get a job I can win her back.'

Martin is not the only job seeker to take such drastic action to find work.

Unemployed Adam Pacitti, 24, spent his last £500 on a giant billboard asking for a job after sending CVs for more than 250 posts.

Adam, who has a first class honours degree in Media Production from the University of Winchester, also set up a website with a video CV and posted pictures of the billboard on Twitter.

He said that his phone 'exploded' following the post and he had more than 7,000 re-Tweets.
