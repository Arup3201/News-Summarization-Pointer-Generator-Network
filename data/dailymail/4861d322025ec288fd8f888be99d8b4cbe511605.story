Toronto FC striker Jermain Defoe has decided to show off his musical talent by singing along to Shaun Escoffery's Space Rider.

The former Tottenham man, who looks incredibly cool in his sunglasses and snapback, gets into the mood by moving his head to the beat.

Defoe, who uploaded the video onto his official Instagram account, then bursts out the chorus of the song which was released in March 2001.

Defoe seems to be having a lot of success away from the music scene as Toronto FC are third in the current standings of the Eastern Conference.

The MLS outfit were hammered 4-1 by Sporting Kansas City on Saturday but were without leading scorer Defoe.

Defoe has scored 11 goals so far this season for former Premier League defender Ryan Nelsen's side.
