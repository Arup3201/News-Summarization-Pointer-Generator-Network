Tony Pulis has told Saido Berahino that being selected for England Under-21s in a 'big honour in itself' after the West Bromwich Albion striker missed out on a senior call-up.

Berahino was in Roy Hodgson's squad for the matches against Slovenia and Scotland last November but did not feature and will instead play for Gareth Southgate's junior side against the Czech Republic and Germany at the end of this month.

Despite scoring 18 goals this season and four in his last seven games, Hodgson preferred Harry Kane, while also recalling fit-again Daniel Sturridge to his squad.

Baggies boss Tony Pulis has insisted that Berahino's call-up to the England Under-21s side is a 'big honour'

'I haven't spoken to him about it. I haven't got a clue,' Pulis said when asked about Berahino's mindset. 'I think if he gets selected for the U21s (side) that's a big honour in itself.

'The lad's been very good lately in his attitude and his approach to everything we have done has been excellent.

'He's not said anything to me about it. He has been carrying an injury for the past few weeks but has still shown great character.' 

On whether Kane might return to the England Under-21 team for the European Championships in the summer, Pulis said: 'I think England should pick their strongest team for every proper tournament but Roy will always have a young player who he think is ready for the senior squad.'
