Family photographs have emerged showing a Chicago mother and the daughter who is accused of beating her to death and stuffing her body in a suitcase, during far happier times, as the teen refuses to cooperate with police in Bali.

Victim Sheila von Wiese-Mack and 19-year-old Heather Mack are seen smiling and embracing lovingly in the pictures, which appear to have been taken a few years back.

But on Tuesday, Mrs von Wiese-Mack met a grisly end, and Indonesian police believe the young woman who once welcomed her mother's affections, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are responsible.

The young couple were arrested Wednesday morning, a day after her mother's battered body was discovered in the bloody suitcase that was left in a taxi outside the luxury St Regis resort in Nusa 
Dua, where they had been staying.

Victim: Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, had a tempestuous relationship with her daughter, reports have claimed

Ida
 Bagus Putu Alit, a forensic expert at the hospital that conducted an 
autopsy, said the victim had been 'hit by a blunt object and the blows 
were concentrated on the face and head'.

On Thursday, police said they were had run psychiatric tests on Ms Mack and an Indonesian lawyer said the teen was demanding U.S. legal representation.

'We have 
done blood and psychiatric tests to try to find out their motive in the 
case, maybe they are mentally unstable,' Djoko Hariutomo, police chief 
for Bali's provincial capital Denpasar, told reporters.

'So far we haven't gotten any information on what is behind the murder. Is it financial or something else? We don't know.'

Television
 broadcast images of Mack, dressed in a pale grey hoodie and denim 
shorts, laughing and telling a group of reporters following her, 'You 
are crazy,' as she walked between rooms in the police station.

'She
 doesn't want to comment on the incident and she declined to give any 
information,' Haposan Sihombing, an Indonesian lawyer appointed by 
police to represent Mack, told Reuters last night.

The 19-year-old peers out from beneath a newspaper: An Indonesian appointed lawyer for Mack told Reuters last night that the American teenager had refused to cooperate with police until she could see a U.S. lawyer

'She kept asking to be represented by a lawyer from the United States,' said Mr Sihombing.

Djoko said Thursday he was looking into whether it was possible under Indonesian law to meet that request.

Neither
 Mack nor Schaefer have been charged. However, Djoko said Thursday that 
the pair have been declared suspects in the case.

According to Indonesian law, police can keep suspects in custody for up to 20 days.

The two suspects will be questioned separately, he said, and Schaefer will also undergo a psychological assessment.

The
 family photographs come after it emerged Schaefer told friends he 
didn't expect to return from his trip to the paradise island.

Schaefer
 wrote on Facebook that he was going to Indonesia and 'wasn't sure when 
he was coming back', then going to China, a former college friend said.

According to CNN affiliate
 Trans TV, the couple told police they had been taken captive at the 
resort by an armed gang, whose members killed Sheila von Weise Mack, but
 they escaped.

Cryptic message: A friend of Schaeffer's who lived with him at university said he had posted a message on Facebook saying he was going to Indonesia and then to China, and didn't know when he was coming back

However, Djoko said that police hadn't found anything on surveillance camera footage from the hotel that supported the claim of an attack by an armed gang.

More details
 have emerged about the lives of the young couple in the past few hours,
 including Mack's tempestuous relationship with her mother, 62, who was 
based in Chicago.

A friend of Schaefer's, who lived in the same dorm as him at Northern Illinois University before he dropped out last year, told NBC Chicago of an 'odd' comment he'd made before traveling to join Mack and her mother in Bali.

Brittany
 Strangmann said: 'A few days ago on Facebook he said he was going to 
Indonesia and wasn't sure when he was coming back, and then going to 
China. I thought that was odd.'

U.S. State 
Department spokesman Marie Harf told Reuters it was aware of reports of a
 U.S. citizen's death in Bali and the arrests of two people in 
connection with the case.

'Obviously
 we are monitoring it and will provide any consular access as 
appropriate,' Ms Harf said, declining to give details due to privacy 
considerations.

An official 
with the U.S. consulate general in Bali, who met Mack at the police 
station on Thursday, declined to comment after the meeting.

Police
 said the young couple left a bloodied suitcase along with other luggage
 in the taxi before checking out of the five-star St Regis hotel, where a
 single room can cost as much as $1,340 a night.

After the couple did not return the driver took the luggage to police, who found Mrs von Wiese-Mack's body.

Ida
 Bagus Putu Alit, a forensic expert at the hospital that conducted an 
autopsy, said the victim had been 'hit by a blunt object and the blows 
were concentrated on the face and head'.

'There were signs of a struggle by the victim as there were bruises on her arms and some fingers were broken,' Alit said.

A St. Regis hotel official said the apparent murder was believed to have taken place in a room booked by Schaefer.

Mack and Schaefer were arrested at a budget hotel about a mile from the St. Regis after a day-long police search.

Staff at the Risata Bali resort said they were immediately suspicious of the couple after they checked in without any luggage.

Risata
 Bali security confirmed their identities after Schaefer asked resort 
staff for a voucher to use the Internet and they alerted authorities, 
said Nyoman Wija, a hotel manager.

Television
 footage showed the two being questioned by police with Schaefer in 
handcuffs. At one point, Mack is shown shielding her face with her hand 
asking a police official why a cameraman was being allowed to film her.

The Mack family lived for a number of years in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois.

Oak Park spokesman David Powers said on Wednesday police responded to 86 calls from the Mack home due to incidents between mother and daughter from 2004 through to June 2013.

No arrests were ever made from the calls, which were a combination of reports of domestic violence, theft, missing person and 911 hang-ups, Powers said.

Mrs von Wiese-Mack more recently had moved to a condominium in Chicago. Her husband and the father of Heather, classical music composer James Mack, died in 2006.

Laura Voigt, a pianist in Oak Park and friend of James Mack, said she remembered seeing mother and daughter fight outside the local high school one morning.

'I was worried about Sheila,' Ms Voigt said.

Mrs von Wiese-Mack had worked as an editor for famed oral historian Studs Terkel and later studied with writer Saul Bellow at the University of Chicago.

Georgia Parchem, a neighbour and friend in Oak Park, said Mrs von Wiese-Mack was a 'lovely, charming woman' and the Macks often held parties involving 'artists and friends from all over the city'.
