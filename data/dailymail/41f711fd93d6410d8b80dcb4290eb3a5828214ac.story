Most people think spare change just weighs them down.

But one California man put his to good use - saving up enough coins and dollar bills to pay his hefty $14,000 property tax bill.

Larry Gasper shocked tellers at a Redding bank branch when he showed up with a wheelbarrow full of change this week.

The grandfather said he'd hit tough times financially so his friends and family decided to chip in to help get him out of debt.

They gave Gasper whatever they could afford, in coins and dollar bills.

'I had to borrow some money,' he told ABC News.

He added that that he'd skipped 
mortgage payments on the house he lives in to make up the balance and 
also raided piggy banks to fill the barrow with change.

'I've missed a few payments on my home to pay for my taxes for this piece of property.

'My grandkids' piggy banks, my daughters' piggy banks, my money, my change and a lot of people have offered to help a bit.'

Heavy: Gasper said he rolled all the money, pictured, himself before packing the $14,000 in the back of his car and driving to the bank

Counting: A video of the transaction shows the teller's jaw drop before she calls over a colleague to witness the bizarre transaction and the two begin to count the mountain of change

Gasper said he was relieved to no longer have the debt - or change - weighing him down.
