It has encountered little difficulty attracting stars from the world of showbusiness.

But those required for hygiene and safety are proving harder to gain for the Chiltern Firehouse.

The exclusive London restaurant has been given only two out of five stars by food health inspectors, meaning an improvement in the kitchen’s cleanliness is necessary.

Officers discovered several areas were not clean, food had not been cooked to its own recommended safe levels and large amounts of the kitchen had no soap for staff to wash their hands.

David Cameron and wife Samantha visited Chiltern Firehouse on one of their 'date nights' in June this year. The restaurant has now been criticised in a local council health and safety report

The restaurant, in Marylebone, central London, has become the place to be seen for London's elite

Prime Minister David Cameron took his wife Samantha there last month for one of their ‘date-nights’ and he is not the only one.

David Beckham, former US President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey and Kylie Minogue have all dined at the popular nightspot in recent weeks but they may not have been keen to try its signature dish of crab-stuffed doughnuts had they read the report compiled by inspectors last month.

It reveals the service fridge, fryer, freezer, and floor in the area which stores the kitchen’s dry food were all deemed ‘dirty’.

Broken glass was found on the shelves of the freezer and the fly screen that prevented insects entering where food is prepared was also judged not to be clean.

There were also gaps in an external store that could have posed a risk of pests entering the kitchen.

A report reveals staff were unable to effectively wash their hands as there was no soap or hot water in the basins in the kitchen’s food preparation area, pastry preparation or grill station. There was also no hot water available at the sink by the kitchen’s entrance.

A spokesman for the restaurant said the points highlighted in the report have already been rectified

Meals involving ‘high-risk’ meats, such as beef, lamb and pork, were cooked but recorded at temperatures below safe levels set in its own manuals. Inspectors criticised the restaurant for not writing down what happened to these dishes – allowing them to tell whether it was thrown away or served to customers.

The restaurant, which opened earlier this year, is part of a hotel housed in the Grade II-listed former Marylebone Fire Station and run by André Balazs, who owns the glamorous Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and the Mercer hotel in New York.

The menu by head chef Nuno Mendes, is not overtly expensive with most main courses costing £25. Typical dishes include chargrilled iberico pork and blackened salmon with sea kale. 

Other A-listers to have visited the venue include singer Lily Allen, supermodel Kate Moss, music mogul Simon Cowell, actress Linsday Lohan, former prime minister Tony Blair and actors Bradley Cooper and Orlando Bloom have all been photographed sneaking out of the back door.

The stream of celebrity diners has made the restaurant one of the most sought after places to eat in the capital

Commenting on the food inspection, Westminster’s food safety manager James Armitage said: ‘When we inspected the Chiltern Firehouse kitchens, we found a number of areas that raised concern including cleanliness and the state of repair of various ceilings, walls and floor coverings. Also, several of the hand basins in the kitchen were lacking soap and hot water.’

A Chiltern Firehouse spokesman said: ‘We are very proud of the restaurant at Chiltern Firehouse, and appreciate the tremendously supportive reviews it has received.

'The vast majority of the issues identified in the council report were related to the expansion of the kitchen and have already been rectified.

‘We have requested a re-inspection and look forward to a significantly higher rating at the earliest opportunity.’
