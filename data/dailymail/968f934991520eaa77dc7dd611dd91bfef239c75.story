A dashboard camera captures the moment a truck swerves to avoid an oncoming vehicle, flips over and appears to unload its cargo of live cows all over the road.

The footage, filmed in Russia, shows the cows tumbling out of the truck and after a few moments of shock, getting to their feet.

The video has been widely touted on YouTube and received in excess of three million hits. SomeÂ  commentators have called it a hoax.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Oh no: Truck swerves across the middle of the road and on to its side, from which point there is no turning back

Over it goes: The truck flips and the cows come tumbling out

Spillage: The cows slide across the road on their backs as the truck comes to a standstill

Legs in the air: The cows roll around on the road. Fortunately there is no oncoming traffic

Up and about: Within a few seconds of spilling out of the overturned truck the cows get back on their feet

One commentator referred to it as 'extreme cow tipping.' Another quipped: 'There's no point crying over spilt milk.'

The driver, like the cows is said to have survived the ordeal.

Russia has become notorious for its terrible driving conditions and high crime rates on the road, so more and more motorists are using dashboard cameras to capture any incident for insurance purposes.

Many truck and bus companies have installed them into their vehicles to 
stop employees from stealing merchandise or pulling illegal stunts while
behind the wheel.

As a result, more and more footage of shocking traffic incidents are emerging from the country.

A compilation video of accidents recently posted online showed jaywalking horses, low-flying fighter jets, errant lorry wheels bouncing towards traffic and crazed gun-firing pedestrians.

In one such clip a couple riding a quad bike somehow flipped their vehicle while travelling one night - leaving them stranded stranded in the middle of the road.
