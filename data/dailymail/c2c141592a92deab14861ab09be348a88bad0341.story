With Princess Beatrice, the Princess Royal and Pippa Middleton among her clients, milliner Rosie Olivia is no stranger to designing hats for well-bred wearers.

But her latest venture, an unusual photo shoot to mark the start of Aintree, sees her creations appear on well-bred models of an entirely different sort.

Strutting their stuff for the camera is a succession of equine stars, most of whom appear happy - if bemused - to find themselves swapping head collars for hats.

Dapper: Lovely though this cobalt straw cap is, its equine wearer seems less than impressed

Looking good! A glamorous dapple grey sports an elaborate hot pink bloom enlivened with delicate crystals

Highlights include a spectacular gold glittery fascinator topped with a lime bow and modelled by a handsome chestnut, and a pink silk number worn by a bored-looking dapple grey.

So good did the equine models look in the hats, milliner Rosie Olivia, who described the shoot as 'brilliantly bizarre', said the horses would be in with an excellent chance of triumphing in the style stakes come Ladies' Day on Friday.

'I spend my days creating weird and 
wonderful designs for fashion-forward ladies, but never did I think I'd 
be styling my hats on models of the four-legged variety,' she revealed.

'It
 was a brilliantly bizarre day, but I think they all look fabulous and 
are definitely a contender for the most stylish appearance this racing 
season.'

Not too keen: This horse appears distinctly unamused with the feather and straw creation perched on his head

Sparkling: This glossy chestnut model looks lovely in his gold glittering fascinator topped with a lime bow

The unusual photo shoot was the brainchild of local portrait company Venture Photography, which set up a mobile studio at the Red House Stables in Warrington, Cheshire, where the shoot took place.

'I've not photographed a horse wearing a designer hat before,' admitted Richard Mayfield, creative director of Venture Photography, 'and it's safe to say I probably won't do so again!'

Although the equine stars of the shoot probably won't get the chance to show off their hats at Aintree, Rosie Olivia's designs are likely to get an airing at the race meeting.

Last year, hats by the milliner, which can cost up to £400, were spotted on scores of racegoers, and have also proved a hit with Princess Beatrice who has been photographed in Rosie Olivia on numerous occasions, including a bespoke creation worn for the Christmas Day service at Sandringham.
