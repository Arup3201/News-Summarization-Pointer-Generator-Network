It's the age old debate: which day is best for booking flights to ensure you get the best deal?

And it may have just been settled.

According to new research from Expedia and the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), it's best to buy tickets on a Tuesday - and ideally, more than 21 days in advance - to take advantage of the best possible rates.

To take advantage of the best prices, book your air travel on a Tuesday and at least three weeks in advance

Travellers who are able to fly on a Thursday and return on a Monday will enjoy the greatest savings on a long weekend away.

Alternatively, those booking a Saturday to Tuesday short-haul weekend flight can save up to 25 per cent, particularly when compared to the more expensive Sunday return. 

Expedia recommends booking your flights at least seven weeks in advance.

For domestic routes, the lowest fares are usually found 50 to 100 days before departure, with the absolute lowest fares found around 57 days prior. 

Cheers to that! According to Expedia's research, it will be cheaper to fly premium in 2015

The report is predicting a general price drop across Europe and North America 

When it comes to international flights, the lowest fares were found even farther in advance - between 150 and 225 days - with the lowest price around the 171 day mark.

And package deals are another way to save cash.

By booking the flight and hotel at the same time, you can save up to US$540 (£344) across all destinations.

In big resort destinations, like Mexico or Hawaii, you can actually save a whopping US$1,100 (£700) simply by bundling.  

For the best deal on a short-haul domestic flight, the lowest rates can be found about 57 days in advance

The findings are contained in a report, Preparing for Takeoff: Air Travel Trends for 2015, which highlights all of the changes that passengers can expect in upcoming months.

And there's good news for travellers. Expedia and the ARC predict that many ticket prices will decrease overall.

This can be attributed to an increase in scheduled flights and a drop in fuel prices, which will mean a general price drop across Europe and North America.

For international flights, booking anywhere between 150-225 days ahead will offer the best deal

Tuesday remains the best day to book a flight, with the lowest prices across the board

In Europe, another major factor will be the rise of low-cost carriers, which 'unbundle' amenities and force the big-name carriers to do the same to compete.

Not only that, but it's going to be cheaper to fly in the premium cabins.

The research indicates that the gap in fares between flying premium and coach will continue to narrow - and ultimately, could even get to a point where premium-class tickets aren't that much more expensive than tickets in coach.

This may not hold true for all flights, but it won't hurt to check the price of first- and business-class seats before you book an economy ticket.
