Two childhood sweethearts who fell in love in the school playground almost 50 years ago have finally married - just like TV's Last Tango in Halifax.

John Hemstalk, 62, and his first love Cathy Orton, 61, were reunited by Facebook in thesame way as the golden oldies in the hit romantic drama.

John was a 14-year-old schoolboy when he first fell head over heels for classmate Cathy.

Cathy was also 14 when she doodled John's name over her school pencil case back in the 1960s.

But their puppy love didn't last and a year later she fell for another boy.

The couple left school but stayed good friends and John was a guest when local beauty queen Cathy got married in 1972.

When John was wed in his twenties the pair lost touch and decided to get on with their lives.

But they met again through Facebook 40 years later and have finally tied the knot.

Their story echoes the hit comedy drama Last Tango in Halifax starring Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid who play pensioners who meet up through the social networking site after being childhood sweethearts.

John told how he turned to Facebook three years ago after going through a divorce. He said: 'My daughter told me to get a life - she was a bit worried about me.

'So I joined Facebook hoping to connect with some old pals and two weeks later a message popped up on his screen.

"Is that the John Hemstalk from all those years ago?"

'My heart stopped. It was Cathy, my first love, after all these years. I replied straight away and before long we were chatting on the phone for hours.'

John, 62, from Sheffield, asked his schoolyard sweetheart for a date and the pair met up for the first time in 38 years.

Father-of-two John said: 'I recognised her sparkling bright blue eyes the moment she walked towards me.

'I never forgot Cathy, she was in my thoughts for those 38 years. I never imagined she would come back to me.

'We didn't stop talking and it wasn't long before we both knew it - we still loved each other.'

John proposed and they married in a small private ceremony - no longer lovesick teenagers - but golden oldies in their sixties.

Mother-of-two Cathy, from Dronfield, Derbyshire, said: 'John was my first love. He was so lovely and used to send me little romantic notes.

'I used to doodle his name all over my pencil case in class. But we were only kids and I broke off our romance but he was always in the back of my mind.

'When we met up for the first time in 38 years I knew him straightaway. It was a moment frozen in time. We just looked at each other and hugged and kissed.

'From that meeting I knew I wanted to be with him. Getting married to John after all these years apart is just wonderful - we've come full circle.

'Of course I think: "What if?" But I try not to focus on the past, I'm just so glad we met up again and will spend the rest of lives together.'

Award-winning Last Tango in Halifax tells the story of Alan and Celia, childhood sweethearts who have been apart for 60 years.

The BBC drama, which has just finished its second series, had more than seven million viewers for its final episode.

It's just like the movies Cathy and John's story is just like that of award-winning Last Tango in Halifax, which tells the tale of Alan and Celia, childhood sweethearts who have been apart for 60 years.
