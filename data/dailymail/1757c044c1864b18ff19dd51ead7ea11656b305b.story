The Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bras are known as being some of the most showstopping lingerie designs in history and the ornate lingerie designs have served as the glittering finale of almost every one of the brand's hotly-anticipated fashion shows since 2001.

In honor of this year's show, which will mark a milestone in the history of the Fantasy Bra with not one, but two of the designs being modeled on the catwalk by models Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio, FEMAIL takes a look back at all 19 Fantasy Bra designs. 

The first Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra was designed in 1996 and modeled by Claudia Schiffer on the cover of the brand's Christmas catalogue, however it was never used in the catwalk show, reportedly because of the incredible security risk involved in showcasing such a valuable item. Ironically, the $1million is the cheapest Fantasy Bra ever to have been designed by the brand and pales in comparison to some of the more recent lingerie sets featured in recent years. 

Although Victoria's Secret continued to design a new Fantasy Bra each year following the success of its original 1996 design, it wasn't until 2001 that the concept was included in the brand's annual catwalk show. Model Heidi Klum, who has had the honor of modeling the Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra on three occasions, was the first Angel to wear one of the designs on the catwalk. 

The most expensive Fantasy Bra design was valued at $15million and holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive lingerie ever created. It was modeled by Gisele Bündchen in 2000 and was made of red satin decorated with more than 300 carats of Thai rubies.
