Chilling leaked footage of South African paralympian Oscar Pistorius re-enacting the moment he shot and killed his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was taken illegally, according to the athlete's lawyers.

The harrowing video, which shows Pistorius as he runs towards the the camera with one arm outstretched as if holding a gun, was broadcast on the Sunday Night documentary slot of 
Australia's Channel Seven.

But a statement from Pistorius' lawyers Ramsay Webber said the 'visual mapping' re-enactment was only for trial preparation. They alleged the footage had been 'obtained  illegally' by Channel Seven.

In the footage from Australia's Channel Seven, Pistorius is seen running awkwardly through a living room without his prosthetic legs. His right arm is stretched out in front of him, as if he was clutching a gun

Further into the video, he can be seen lifting a woman re-creating the moment he found Reeva shot

'For the family, the airing of this footage constitutes a staggering breach of trust and an invasion of the family's privacy,' Brian Webber said in a statement, according to Reuters.

They said no permission for the disclosure of the material had been given.

One legal expert in Johannesburg, Professor Stephen Tuson of the Wits School of Law, told Reuters the screening of the re-enactment footage could be a breach of sub-judice laws that prohibit the publication outside the courtroom of evidence or material that could influence the outcome of the trial.

"If this was done in preparation for the trial in the context of attorney-client confidentiality, it would be privileged and its publication would be a breach of the sub-judice rule. Its consequences could be a reviewable irregularity," Tuson told Reuters.

Sunday Night Executive Producer, Mark Llewellyn, said in a statement that the story 'was a significant investigation by Walkley Award-winning journalists'.

'We would not have run the footage if we thought we had obtained it illegally. The story was run in Australia only and not made available to any other territory,' Mr Llewellyn said.

'The material shown on Sunday Night goes to the heart of both the prosecution and defense cases, including the account provided by Oscar Pistorius.'

Pistorius, who was born without a fibula bone in either leg and had his lower legs amputated before he could walk, is seen moving quite quickly and with a high level of agility for a man without the bottom half of his legs.

Pistorius can be seen running towards and away from the camera and circling back around the living room of his home. As he re-enacts the scene he explains to investigators: 'I heard the noise and fired four shots.'

Pistorius' lawyers alleged the usage of the video filmed by a U.S. company specialising in forensic animation, The Evidence Room, which had been engaged by Pistorius' defence team, also breached a non-disclosure agreement made with the Cleveland, Ohio company, Reuters reports.

The footage is overlayed with a recording of Pistorious' voice, a recreation of the moment he claims he warned what he believed was an intruder in the bathroom.

'I'll call the police, get out, get out! Get the f*** out!,' he said.

The paralympian can then be heard screaming and shouting hysterically after he opened the door to find his girlfriend dead on the bathroom floor.

'Please, God, please, please help. Help me. Help me!'

In another scene the athlete can be seen on all fours, dragging a woman from a bathroom similar to the one in which he shot Miss Steenkamp.

Later in the chilling footage, Pistorius is timed on how long it takes him to put his prosthetic legs on, just over 25 seconds.

He then recreates the moment, slumping himself over the toilet with his legs splayed on the floor, he found his girlfriend 'bleeding to death' after he beat down the bathroom door with a cricket bat.

Scott Roder, an American crime scene specialist, told Sunday Night that when he had his legs or blades on Pistorius was a confident man. However when he was without them he felt vulnerable.

'When he's on his stumps, he's short, the confidence washes away from his face,' Mr Roder said.

The program reported that Mr Roder prepared a full analysis of the crime scene and supplied it to Pistorius' defence team.

Earlier on Sunday a leaked promotional clip was released by Seven.

This week a psychiatrist told the Pretoria court that Pistorius could not simply run away if he found himself in a vulnerable position. Even turning around is 'quite a process', he said.

The video is reported to have been shot by an American company and Pistorius' lawyers are said to be livid at how the video was released.

Pistorius' spokeswoman Anneliese Burgress has said the 27-year-old's legal advisors are seeking 'urgent clarification' from the broadcaster in relation to the footage.

It was reported before the trial that an American firm called The Evidence Room was preparing an animated re-enactment of the events, but no mention was made of it in court. 

Pistorius, 27, 
is accused of deliberately murdering Reeva Steenkamp. He shot her four times through a locked toilet door at his Pretoria home on Valentine’s Day last year.

The
 double amputee told the court he was convinced she was an intruder and that he fired his 9mm pistol accidentally out of fear and panic. He said he went to 
investigate the noises coming from the cubicle before he fired.

Pistorius' trial resumed last week after a lengthy adjournment so the paralympian could undergo intense psychiatric evaluation.

The trial heard that Pistorius has a 'split personality' with a superstar 
status in front of the cameras and a private life as a disabled man.

His legal team said he was acting out of 'morbid fear not anger' when he shot dead his girlfriend.

As
 the Paralympic star’s lengthy trial finally draws to a close, his legal
 team have presented Pistorius as a highly 
vulnerable double amputee who battled great pain and genuine fears every
 day of his life. The prosecution paint a picture of a volatile, gun-toting man.

Reading
 from a psychiatric report into Pistorius’ mindset, defence counsel 
Kenny Oldwage told Pretoria’s High Court on Wednesday that the runner was 'the 
international superstar more confident and in control' standing six feet
 tall on his famous carbon blades.

While he was 'a vulnerable and fearful 
disabled person' barely five feet tall on his stumps.

Professor
 Wayne Derman, who specialises in treating disabled athletes, is the 
final witness to appear in defence of the sprinter who.

He said: 'Although he loathes to be pitied in any way, the 
hard truth is that he does not have lower legs. You’ve got a paradox, 
of an individual who is supremely able and an individual who is 
significantly disabled.'

Professor Derman will face a second day of gruelling cross-examination from prosecutor Gerrie Nel when the trial resumes on Monday.

Pistorius,
 whose carbon running prosthetics have earned him the nickname the 
‘Blade Runner’, denies murder and three firearms charges.

Miss Steenkamp’s mother June, who has seen much of the trial at Pretoria High Court, hopes her daughter will rest in peace after the verdict. She said: 'I don’t hate Oscar, I’ve forgiven him. But I am determined to face him.'
