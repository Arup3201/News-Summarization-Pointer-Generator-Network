At least 10 civilian parachutists were killed alongside a pilot today when their light plane crashed into a field in Belgium.

Four
of those on board the stricken Pilatus PC-6 Porter had been seen 
desperately trying to get out after the aircraft caught fire and a wing 
dropped off.

But they 
were unable to open their chutes before the plane crashed into the 
ground near the town of Marchovelette, in the southern Namur region.

At least 10 people are dead after a plane carrying a group of parachutists crashed into this field close to the town of Marchovelette in Belgium. The pilot is thought to be among the dead

Crash site: The crash took place near the city of Namur in souther Belgium

The
horrific accident took place at around 3.45pm after the aircraft had 
taken off from Temploux airfield, some 45 miles south east of Brussels, 
and hit the ground some ten minutes later.

Jean-Claude Nihoul, the mayor of nearby Fernelmont, said there were ‘at least 10 passengers on board and probably one pilot’.

Mr
Nihoul said most of those on board had been due to take part in a 
parachute jump but ‘crashed around 10 minutes after take-off.’

One
eyewitness told Belgium radio station RTL he saw ‘a plane lose its wing
mid-flight and crash with a massive bang. I didn't see anyone parachute
out.’

There were no survivors in the crash, which saw the plane burnt to a wreck by the time firefighters arrived.

Neither the names nor nationalities of those killed were immediately available.

Deaths: It was confirmed that the crash had no survivors

Protection: Firefighters install a screen around the crash site, near the village of Marchovelette

Investigation: Firefighters were at the scene searching the wreckage this afternoon

Condolences: Belgian president Elio Di Rupo tweeted about the crash. His tweet translates to: 'On the plane accident near Namur: My heartfelt thoughts go first and foremost to the victims, their families and their loved ones.'

Another
witness involved in the rescue effort said: ‘The plane lost a wing, 
which was found up to a kilometer from the scene of the accident. Some 
spoke of an in-flight explosion, but I think the main explosion occurred
on impact with the grown.

‘Pieces
came off the plane, then it nosedived. There were reports of up to four
parachutists trying to get out so as to jump to safety, but all were 
unsuccessful’.

A crisis centre has been set up to assist with relatives of victims, and those who saw the accident. Elio
Di Rupo, the Belgian Prime Minister, said he was ‘hugely moved’ by the 
tragic accident, and offered ‘sincere condolences’ to all those 
connected to the deceased.

Depute prime minister Joelle Milquet, said: ‘All our thoughts are with the victims, their families and their friends.’

The Pilatus PC-6 Porter is a single-engine short take-off and landing aircraft which is often used by sports parachutists.

Made
and designed by Swiss company Pilatus Aircraft, it went into production
in 1959 and has also since been built by US company Fairchild Hiller.
