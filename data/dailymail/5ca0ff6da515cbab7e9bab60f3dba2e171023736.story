This adorable little marsupial might not know it, but he will soon become a vital link in an Australian-only conservation program designed to preserve the dwindling Yellow-Bellied Glider from extinction.

This four-month old marsupial, who is not yet named, is one of a declining number of vulnerable gliders who are being displaced from their habitat at an alarming rate. Found mostly along Australia's eastern seaboard, their homes - old-growth trees of more than 120 years old - are being uprooted and cleared as new development moves in.

The situation, wildlife expert Wendy Gleen said, will become dire without human intervention: 'We need to get the message out there that we must do everything we can, because they will disappear if we don't help.'

This Yellow-Bellied glider emerged from her mother's pouch last week, and is less than the size of a normal human hand

apart from being 'very very cute' Australian animals wildlife keeper Wendy Gleen said the marsupial is a very social and friendly animal

Luckily, it is vital reproductive projects like Sydney's Taronga Zoo which is heeding the call and coming to the tiny marsupial's rescue. The captivity breeding program is the only program worldwide which is aiming to undergo a rapid turnaround in the animal's dwindling population.

This tiny glider is one of 13 joeys already born into the captivity breeding program. He emerged bright eyed and bushy tailed last week from his mother's pouch where he was swiftly taken into the capable hands of the zoo's animal handlers

In the last few days, keepers at the nocturnal exhibit, Australian Nightlife, have been able to get a good look at the little youngster who is roughly the same size as a rabbit.

Also known as the Fluffy Glider, the remarkable marsupials weigh just 700g but can effortlessly glide from treetop to treetop at an incredible distance of up to 140 metres. It is most distinguishable by its grey-brown fur which is highlighted by the orange to yellow fur on its belly.

Australian Mammals keeper Wendy Gleen said: 'they have the softest fur of any animal. It’s so soft that you can see your hand touching it but can’t actually feel it against your hand.'

If it's cute and fluffy appearance isn't enough to persuade people to help, than Mrs Gleen said she don't know what will. She said the Yellow-Bellied Glider faces an uphill battle of survival as recent development along Australia's eastern seaboard, where the glider inhabits, has seen the removal of much of its natural bushland.

At full size the animal weighs less than 1kg and is roughly the same size as a rabbit

The biggest problem facing the declining animal population is the destruction of its habitat along the eastern seaboard of Australia

Taronga Zoo's social media team are running a naming competition on Facebook with an Australian-based theme for this little marsupial

This little joey, when fully grown, has the ability to fly up to about 140 metres between treetop-to-treetop

It requires an area the size of 50-hectares to fly in, and old-growth trees of up to 120 years old to nest. Ms Gleen said many Australians who live with the animal by its back door do not even know it exists.

'The biggest problem for the gliders is local bushland being broken up by development along the eastern seaboard where they’re found,' Ms Gleen said. 'I live in the Central Coast and you would be amazed at how many people don't know what the Yellow-Bellied Glider is.'

She is urging people to help regenerate the population's natural habitat by planting trees, such as the mahogany, which it is best suited too. 'People can help by planting trees and shrubs that are found locally in backyards to create wildlife corridors and by getting involved with local bush regeneration groups.'

She said it is vital that the message of the animal's vulnerability is spread throughout the community.

Taronga Zoo’s Education team is launching its new project Yellow-bellied Glider with school students on the Central Coast as part of its very successful community wildlife education program, which focuses on threatened Australian wildlife including Little Penguins, Regent Honeyeaters and platypus.

There already are 160 students from four schools involved in the Yellow-bellied Glider project. Taronga Zoo will also  be launching a naming competition for the joey through its Facebook and Instagram pages.
