A scowling cat who became an internet sensation known as the 'Grumpy Cat' has launched her own book.

The mixed breed cat achieved overnight fame last year after photos of her sour puss look went viral.

But that down in the dumps expression has now helped the two-year-old family pet whose name is Tardar Sauce win global fame.

Strike a pose: She kept up her grumpy persona as he sat on a velvet cushion

As part of her new starry life, she attended her book launch in Santa Monica last night along with owner Tabatha Bundesen.

She kept up her grumpy persona as she sat on a velvet cushion next to a copy of her book Grumpy Cat: A Grumpy Book in Los Angeles!

She also posed for pictures with his fans, although she still did not raise a smile.

Hollywood producer Todd Garner plans 
to make a film featuring the permanently unhappy feline in which she 
will be given the power of speech in a family-orientated comedy.

Garner,
who has worked on the Adam Sandler comedy 'Jack and Jill,' said: 'This 
started off as a picture of a cat, but rare is an image that evokes that
much comedy.

'You read all
of the memes and the comments, and one is funnier than the next. We 
think we can build a big family comedy around this character.'

The Grumpy Cat's sour faced expression is caused by dwarfism and under bite.

A photo of the sour faced look was posted on the web by her owner Tabatha Bundesen.

It quickly went viral and the cat achieved almost one million 'likes' on her Facebook page.

She was featured on US TV and even interviewed by Time magazine.

Fans at the SXSW film and music festival in Texas queued for hours to meet the cat.

Hollywood talent agent Ben Lashes signed the cat as a client and helped negotiate the film deal for her owners from Morristown, Arizona.

He told the Wall St. journal his new client was unimpressed with deal - and even talk of lucrative merchandising spin-offs.

'She hates movies,' said Lashes.
