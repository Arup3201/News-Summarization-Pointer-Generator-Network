Instead of a complimentary breakfast , access to a fitness
centre or even simple free coffee most hotel guests say their number one need
is access to free Wi-Fi.

Reflecting how the internet has become indispensable in our
modern lives a new survey by Hotels.com has revealed 38 percent of travellers said
free Wi-Fi was a must while only 25 percent said breakfast was essential.

On top of those findings, the survey said that 35 percent
wanted Wi-Fi to become more available in hotels and just over one third at 31
percent answered that they wanted it to become mandatory in hotels.

Essential: 31 percent of those surveyed by Hotels.com say that free Wi-Fi should be mandatory in rooms

‘Given the explosion of mobile use in the past three years,
it is no surprise that travellers are requiring free and fast Wi-Fi,’ said
Taylor L. Cole, director of public relations and social media for Hotels.com.

‘Many guests never travel without their tablets, smartphones
and laptops.

‘It’s intuitive as packing a toothbrush. Guests use these
items in their rooms to plan activities for the next day.’

The survey of 415 guests polled by Hotels.com offered up
surprising and some not so surprising findings.

Linked in with the need for wireless internet in rooms, 23
percent of guests said that their favourite modern in-room amenity was the use
of their iPad.

However, in a reminder of a more traditional hotel stay, 45
percent reported that their favourite new amenity at a hotel is a happy hour at
the bar, a wine tasting evening or any activities involving free food and
drinks.

And what hotel stay would not be complete without a little
judicious theft from your room?

Fourteen percent of guests admitted to stealing towels from
their rooms and 12 percent admitted taking a magazine or a book.

However, maybe not so surprisingly, 66 percent of guests
protested their innocence and claimed never to have stolen an item from their
hotel room.

The gender gap was reflected well in the survey too, with 23
percent of women preferring to see designer toiletries in their rooms, while 27
percent of men wanted access to the fitness centre and spa.

If offered a celebrity style stay, the top option for 35
percent of men and 38 percent of women was to have a pre-stocked kitchen with
their favourite food and drink to hand.

And in a piece of customer research that hotels may want to
heed, 37 percent of those polled said that they never ever touched the bathroom
phone.
