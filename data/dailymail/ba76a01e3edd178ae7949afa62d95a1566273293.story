Two brazen thieves were caught on camera lounging on a sofa while swigging stolen wine after breaking into a house in broad daylight.

Craig Law, 34, and Luke Smith, 22, can be clearly seen on the footage searching the front room of the house in Dudley, Birmingham, before complaining there's nothing to steal from the property.

They call the owner ‘cheap’ and whinge that they will only get ‘a tenner’ for the Freesat box.

The pair were caught on police cameras 
which had been set up in the property, a decoy house to catch burglars, 
which is one of many houses, sheds and garages in the area being used to
‘blitz’ crime in the West Midlands.

Caught on camera: Luke Smith, 22, pictured left holding a stolen bottle of wine and Freesat box, and Craig Law, 34, pictured right, were both filmed breaking in to a property before complaining there wasn't much to steal

Brazen: Craig Law, 34, then decided to take a few minutes to relax on the sofa while swigging wine stolen from the kitchen - before tipping it over the floor when he realised it had been filled with water

The 34-year-old then disappears from the screen before returning with a wine bottle and plonks himself down on the sofa.

The thief then opens the bottle of wine before complaining it has been filled with water and chucks it on the floor. He then tries to wipe off his fingerprints with his top.

Eventually Smith, in a coat, suggests they should leave before neighbours raise the alarm.

Law, 34, who lived in the same street as the targeted house, was arrested within hours of the offence on 24 June. 

Complaining: The pair can be heard on the video footage calling the owner of the property in Dudley, Birmingham, cheap while whinging they will only get a' tenner' for the Freesat box

In no rush: Craig Law can be seen sitting on the sofa in the property - apparently unconcerned about being caught by the owners

Smith handed himself in weeks later - bringing the Freesat box with him.

Law was jailed for eight months and Smith was given a ten-week suspended sentence after both pleaded guilty to burglary last month.

Sergeant Matt Morgan, from Dudley CID, said: 'The pair were completely unaware that their every move was being filmed by the cameras that were dotted around the property.

'We are using more and more of these sites to catch unsuspecting thieves - houses, sheds garages and outbuildings can be fitted with equipment which is portable and easy to install, meaning any property in a burglary hot spot area can be quickly converted to capture thieves.

Ignorant bliss: The pair eventually decide its time to leave - completely unaware that everything has been caught on camera

In court: Craig Law was jailed for eight months while Luke Smith was given a 10-week suspended sentence for burglary

'The cameras also work on infra-red meaning we can download clear images - even ones filmed at night.

'We also work with the local community to reduce the likelihood of being a victim of crime in the first place and officers continue to offer crime prevention advice and encourage people to register property through the online property recording website immobilise.

'As police officers we see the negative impact crime can have on, not only people’s property but also their sense of safety and their quality of life. That is why we will relentlessly pursue burglars and ensure they are brought before the courts.'
