One of Manchester United's many global partners Nissin have created an animation featuring Wayne Rooney, Angel di Maria and Robin van Persie.

The Japanese food company, which makes instant noodles, became United's 29th official sponsor in June and has unveiled it's new marketing campaign 'Hungry to Win' which it is hoped will reflect Manchester United's vision to be the best both on and off the pitch.

The animation is the first time United's players have been depicted in such a way.

On Saturday an exclusive screening was held at Old Trafford while three of the club's star men themselves - Rooney, Di Maria and van Persie were challenged to draw some of their fellow team-mates.

Whilst  Rooney and Di Maria each appeared to draw Marouane Fellaini with his distinctive hair or Dutch team-mate Daley Blind, Van Persie's picture of goalkeeper David de Gea was just about the best effort of the night.

The Red Devils defeated Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday to move up to sixth in the Premier League table, 13 points behind leaders Chelsea.
