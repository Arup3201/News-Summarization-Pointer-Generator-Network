The body of a stowaway was found inside a passenger jet that landed at Heathrow today.

British Airways said the corpse was inside the landing gear bay of a Boeing 747 after it arrived at the London airport from Cape Town in South Africa.

'We are liaising with the South African authorities and Cape Town airport after a body was found in the landing gear bay of one of our aircraft,' a company spokesman said.

Mystery: The stowaway was found on a BA flight when it landed at Heathrow this morning

'They are investigating how this incident took place, which involved a Boeing 747 which arrived this morning from Cape Town.

'This is a very rare and sad event and our thoughts are with the individual’s family.'

The Metropolitan Police said the body was a man who was not a member of the jumbo jet’s crew or a passenger on the flight.

'Police were called at approximately 6.25am on Thursday August 23 to an incoming flight at Heathrow Airport following the discovery of a man’s body,' a spokesman said.

'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended.

'The man was pronounced dead at 7.07am.

'The death is being treated as non-suspicious.

'Inquiries are ongoing to establish the man’s identity.'

It
is believed the dead man could be a person who was spotted scaling the 
fence at Cape Town International Airport last night before heading 
towards a BA flight getting ready to take off.

Airports Company South Africa, which runs the airport, said it was carrying out an investigation.

A
spokeswoman said: 'Last night at approximately 8.40pm a person was 
detected scaling the perimeter fence at Cape Town International Airport 
(CTIA).

'The airport 
immediately responded and, as a security patrol officer attempted to 
apprehend the man, he ran in the direction of a British Airways aircraft
already in its holding pattern ready for take-off.

'Airports Company South Africa is concerned about the loss of life and thus views this incident in the utmost serious light. A full investigation will be undertaken.'
