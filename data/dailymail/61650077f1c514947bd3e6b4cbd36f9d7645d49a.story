A mother sacrificed her life to save her daughter by pushing the little girl out of the path of an oncoming car that suddenly accelerated towards them.

Colleen Segbers, 33, had less than a second to react and push 10-year-old daughter Gwen to safety as the pair walked towards a Walgreens store in St. Louis, Missouri.

The mother was struck by a vehicle that had lost control after the driver accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake, according to St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.

Speaking from the scene, a law enforcement official told KSDK: 'The mother was actually able to push the child out of the way of the vehicle as they were trying to avoid being hit.

'The child was not struck. However, she was pretty upset given the circumstances.'

 A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money for funeral expenses and care for Gwen, who it says 'must continue this journey without her mother and best friend'.

'She was an outstanding mother, dependable and honest friend, an ambassador of doing the 'Right' thing and do it now!

'She will be missed by many and memories of her dancing, laughing, enjoying life, being a great example of a mother, friend, sister, daughter, co-worker, soldier for the greater good and the most recent about her heroic ending will echo eternally.'
