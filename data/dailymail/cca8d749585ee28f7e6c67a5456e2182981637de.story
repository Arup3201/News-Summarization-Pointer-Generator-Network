Trading has made a positive start on the New York Stock Exchange after resuming for the first time since being shut for two days by Hurricane Sandy.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg rang
the opening bell at 9.30am (1.30pm GMT), right on schedule, as stock traders cheered
from the iconic trading floor below, falsely rumored to be flooded, but
dry Wednesday morning, and festive.

'It's good for the city, good for 
country, it's good for everyone to get back to work,' he said moments later while leaving the exchange building at 11 Wall Street.

The market got off to a good start after the shutdown. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18 points to 13,125 in the first hour of trading.

The last time the exchange closed because of weather for two consecutive days was during the Blizzard of 1888 - 124 years ago.

The exchange is running Wednesday on backup generators since power is nonexistent in large parts of downtown Manhattan.

'It's been very smooth,' Duncan Niederauer, CEO of NYSE Euronext, told CNBC from the floor of the exchange. 'The market-making community is more than staffed enough to be open.'

He added: 'We jokingly said this morning we may be the only building south of Midtown that has water, lights and food.'

The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down a fraction of a point to 1,411. The Nasdaq composite lost 16 points to 2,971.

General Motors jumped $1.46 to $24.74 after beating most analysts' profit forecasts for the third quarter.

MasterCard's net income rose strongly in the third quarter, and Visa will report after the closing bell as well.

Dozens of quarterly earnings reports that had been postponed because of the storm will be arriving over the next two days.

The government releases its October employment report on Friday.

Stock futures had been rising ahead of
the first opening for Wall Street this week after being forced to close
down before the superstorm struck the city.

Stressful: While opening trading was mainly positive, this trader was clearly feeling the strain

Tense times: The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose five points to 1,417 in the the first half-hour of trading, while the Nasdaq composite slipped two points to 2,985

Unique situation: Tuesday marks the first time since 1888 that the NYSE remained closed for two consecutive days because of weather

Global
markets remained relatively buoyant during the outage caused by the 
hurricane and rose again Wednesday on strong airlines earnings from 
Europe and a strong quarter from Mazda in Asia. 

Dow Jones industrial futures were up 55 
points to 13,109. The broader S&P futures have tacked on 9.1 points 
to 1,416.70. Nasdaq futures are up 12.25 points to 2,671.25.

Corporate earnings coming out 
Wednesday include General Motors, MasterCard and Visa. Dozens of 
quarterly reports which had been postponed will be arriving over the 
next two days.

There had been erroneous reports 
Monday that the exchange floor had flooded. Exchange spokesman Ray 
Pellecchia said the exchange's building did not have any flooding or 
damage.

Tuesday marks the first time since 
1888 that the NYSE remained closed for two consecutive days because of 
weather. The earlier shutdown was caused by a massive snow storm.

Sections of Manhattan were flooded on Tuesday and power was shut off to millions of people and 
businesses up and down the East Coast.

Manhattan's financial district was 
one of the hardest hit when Hurricane Sandy slammed New York Monday 
afternoon and through the night.

Initial reports that the exchange was three feet underwater were denied by a press spokesman.

'There has been no damage to our 
building or systems, and we will conduct tests with the industry today 
with the aim of reopening U.S. markets on Wednesday,' NYSE spokesman Ray
Pellecchia said in a statement.

The closure has made several records 
in the history of the exchange, as Monday's closing was the first time 
that the markets were formally shut since the days following the 
September 11 attacks in 2001.

Beyond that, it was the first time that it closed since Hurricane Gloria 27 years ago.

Like much of the city, the Exchange 
braced for the impact of Hurricane Sandy on Sunday, lining up a sandbag 
barrier outside the building on iconic Wall Street.

CNN earned itself another black eye after wrongly reporting that the New York Stock Exchange was flooded with three feet of water following the worst of Hurricane Sandy.

‘There has been no damage to our building or systems, and we will conduct tests with the industry today with the aim of reopening U.S. markets on Wednesday,’ NYSE spokesman Ray Pellecchia said in a statement.

During a live segment on Piers Morgan’s show Monday night, the anchor spoke with the network’s meteorologist who based the sensational claim solely on a comment left in a chat room.

‘You have an update on the stock exchange situation. Do we still think that three feet of water got into the exchange? There seem to be conflicting reports now,’ Morgan asked meteorologist Chad Myers.

‘Oh, is that right? You know, I got that from the National Weather Service chat bulletin board. It was right on there; it said three feet of water on the floor. I don’t know if there’s conflicting reports or not,’ Myers said.

The claim instantly went viral, spreading quickly on social networks and circulating as fact.

An NYSE official quickly tried to thwart the rumor, saying that the infrastructure of the landmark Wall Street building was ‘fine’.

A spokesman for the network issued a vague apology, purposefully avoiding the point of the fact that their sources were as murky as the alleged sea water that covered much of lower Manhattan.

‘Chad referenced a National Weather Service report that turned out to be incorrect. We quickly made an on air correction. We regret the error,’ CNN spokesman Bridget Leininger said.

Nasdaq officials began employing 
their contingency plans as soon as they came to the decision to close on
Sunday around 10.30pm.

Traders were able to continue to 
complete a drastically-reduced level of orders electronically, as many 
banks have remote systems set up so that employees can work from home in
crisis situations.

The New York Stock Exchange, which is
a privately-held company in itself, keeps a secondary location up and 
running in case of emergency where all data is stored.

The problem there, however, is that 
the data centre is in Mahwah, New Jersey, which is dealing with 
potentially more structural damage than New York.

According to Wall Street and Tech, 
the centre boasts a supply of 28 megawatts of power, which equates to 
the amount used to power 4,500 residential homes.

Additionally NYSE spokesman Robert 
Rendine told The New York Times that they have a number of generators 
and sufficient fuel to power the site for at least one week if 
electricity does not return.

'I'm a little surprised that the 
exchanges couldn't secure the technology needed to keep the market 
operating,' said Dominic Salvino, a trader from the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange told Bloomberg Businessweek.

'It seems unreasonable that the 
nation's financial markets have to shut down just because everyone has 
located themselves within five miles of each other in New Jersey.

'A snow
storm in Chicago wouldn't shut down trading on the East Coast.'

The ripple effects are already being 
seen, as companies are postponing their quarterly earnings, which were 
scheduled to be released earlier this week.

According to CBS News, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and media conglomerate Thomson Reuters were two of the tardy reportees.

Dozens of companies have postponed 
earnings reports this week because of the storm, but Ford Motor Co. did 
release results for the third quarter that topped Wall Street 
expectations.

Ford's revenue fell 3 percent to 
$32.1 billion because of the economic crisis in Europe and falling sales
in South America.
