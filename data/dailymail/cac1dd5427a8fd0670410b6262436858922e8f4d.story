Defending champion Charl Schwartzel will try to make it three Alfred Dunhill Championships in a row when he tees it up at the Leopard Creek Country Club this week.

The 2011 Masters winner has won by 12 shots and four shots in the last two years and he is going for the hat-trick, having won his maiden European Tour title on this course a decade ago.

'Even if I am playing badly it seems to treat me well,' Schwartzel told European Tour Radio ahead of the second event of the 2015 schedule.

The South African won the Alfred Dunhill Championship with a score of -17 last year in Malelane

'It is 11 years now I've been on tour and you get courses that suit you and this is one where I feel more comfortable than other courses.

'2004 was my breakthrough win and I think those are the ones you never forget.'

The Malelane course, bordering Kruger National Park, is also a favourite of Schwartzel's compatriot Louis Oosthuizen even if his record is not the best there.

Since a second place at the start of the 2006 season, the 2010 Open champion has missed five cuts at the venue.

Schwartzel speaks to the media ahead of the Alfred Dunhill Championship in South Africa this week

'I always come here and have a great time, just being out in the wildlife but I am focused on the golf, ' said the 32-year-old, who has registered three top-10s in his last four tournaments.

'I want to have a good finish and hopefully this week Leopard Creek can be kind to me for a change.

'This is definitely my favourite golf course in South Africa. I always love coming here and it's always in great condition.'

Yorkshireman Danny Willett considered pulling out of the event after winning last week's NedBank Challenge in Sun City but decided to honour his commitment despite a hectic few days.

'Last night was the first night I'd slept properly,' he said.

'But last week's gone, as brilliant as it was, and it is a new job to do this week.

'Luckily I am playing this week so I'll not be day-dreaming all week.'
