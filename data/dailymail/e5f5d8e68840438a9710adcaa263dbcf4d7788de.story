Resplendent in elaborate feathered headdresses, flowing gowns and bizarre bejewelled make-up, it looked as if Halloween had come early as the Mao Geping Make-up Trends Launch show got underway in Beijing.

The biannual China Fashion Week pulls in crowds of fashionistas from across Asia and the Pacific and showcases the work of some of the country's biggest designer names, among them NE TIGER and Wang Yutao.

But this time around, all eyes were on make-up artist Mao Geping, who is famous for his outré take on cosmetics and the dramatic couture-style shows he puts on each time.

Spectacular: Models on the runway at Mao Geping's make-up trends launch in Beijing sported a variety of elaborate looks

Inspiration: For his show, Mao Geping, who is China's most famous make-up artist, looked to the pasty for inspiration

Bold: Not even male models were allowed to go unadorned, as this gold-leaf heavy look demonstrates

Silver style: Pale bejewelled lips and elaborately decorated eyebrows are set to be big trends in 2015 according to Mr Geping

Striking: Mr Geping's opulent make-up looks were combined with elaborate feathered hats and dramatic flowing gowns

While last season saw him put his unique spin on Victorian dewy prettiness, this time it was China's Ming empresses who got the Geping treatment, with models sporting elaborated bejewelled hairstyles and colourful feathered eyelashes.

Others were sent down the catwalk bearing pale beaded lip art, while more still wore brightly coloured jewellery woven into their eyebrows and stuck in swirls to their eyelids.

Spectacular though Mr Geping's work was, he had serious competition in the shape of NE TIGER, who also referenced China's imperial past in his couture collection.

The opening show of China Fashion Week, the new collection from the Beijing stalwart featured a spectacular series of dresses, many in red and gold, as well as a series of dramatic evening dresses, many of which made use of traditional Chinoiserie prints.

Glamorous: Along with beaded and feathered eyes, glittery red lips appeared repeatedly on Mr Geping's catwalk

Pink perfection: A model shows off a striking pale pink couture gown during the Mao Geping show in Beijing

Elaborate: Hair was also given the Geping treatment and was fashioned into elegant plaited buns and sculptural up-dos

Keeping it simple: Not every look featured glitter galore. Others, such as this one, offered relatively simple smoky eyes and red lips

Bejwelled: It wasn't just eyes that that got the beading treatment - hair too was given a glamorous twist courtesy of some crystals

Stunning: This beautiful beaded headdress referenced China's Ming Dynasty - as did the opulent bejewelled eye make-up

Colourful: According to Mr Geping, navy blue enlivened with pink are the new smoky eye colours du jour

Swirl: This pretty bridal look comes complete with bold scarlet lips and elaborately bejewelled eyes

Lovely: In addition to Mr Geping's spectacular take on make-up, models were given a series of pretty hats to wear

Spectacular: This elaborate design, complete with bejewelled and feathered eyebrows, was one of the standout looks of the show

Other highlights from Beijing so far include Shenbai Peng Jing and Galatea Ren Chunhua's glamorous take on bridal wear, while hipster label EVE'S TEMPTATION also proved a hit with local critics.

China Fashion Week, which continues until Sunday and includes 66 shows, also features designers from foreign shores, among them Denmark which sent Kopenhagen Fur to fly the flag for Danish style.

Highlights scheduled in for later in the week include Wu Huanran's hotly anticipated new collection for URBAN EQUIPMENT and Watermark Deng Zhaoping's latest offerings. 

Highlight: Mr Geping's collection is one of the highlights of China Fashion Week, which is now in its 17th season

Big news: China Fashion Week is building an impressive international reputation and also hosts designers from other parts of the world

Popular: Denmark and Russia both sent designers to China, with Kopenhagen Fur flying the flag for Danish style

Low key: While some looks, such as this one, are pared down, much of the fashion on show in China is notable for opulence

Smooth moves: Along with Mr Geping's efforts, other highlights of China Fashion Week include NE TIGER and Wang Yutao

Thinking alike: Like Mr Geping, NE TIGER showed a Ming Dynasty inspired collection during his show on Saturday

Loved: The event, which features work by 66 different designers, is enormously popular with China's fashion set

He might not have been striding down the catwalk but Polish novelist Michał Witkowski, 39, made sure all eyes were on him as he appeared front row at Fashion Week Poland sporting a bizarre hat that came complete with live maggots.

Mr Witkowski was attending a show in Lodz when he appeared in the hat, which also featured a series of tubes and hypodermic syringes, and was held in place by a piece of white netting.

The novelist, who is famous for his 2001 debut novel Copyright and the 2004 follow-up Lubiewo, completed the all-white ensemble with a fringed handbag containing a substance that looked suspiciously like urine.

Unusual look: Michał Witkowski accessorised his maggot hat with a fringed bag containing something that looked suspiciously like urine

Live and kicking: Despite being confined to a hat festooned with syringes, the maggots appeared happy with their lot
