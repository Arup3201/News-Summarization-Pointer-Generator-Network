It's often used to treat cradle cap, dry skin and other childhood ailments.

But mothers looking to buy Johnson's Baby Oil from Amazon got more than they bargained for when the site also suggested sex dice, blindfolds and lube as some related potential purchases.

Under the 'Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought' section, Amazon offered a string of kinky suggestions for those looking to buy baby oil, which more closely resembled a shopping list from Fifty Shades Of Grey than one for baby skincare.

Kinky links: Shoppers looking to buy Johnson's Baby Oil on Amazon found that Adult Love Dice and Durex also came up in their search

Top of the list were Adult Sex Love Dice priced at £2.82, which have an instruction on each side of the die such as 'suck', 'blow' and 'lick', to 'help couples spice things up in the bedroom'.

Alternatively, Amazon reveals other baby oil customers also purchased blindfolds for just £1.15 and boxes of 'extra safe' Durex.

The shopping website suggests related products to customers based on what others have purchased together in recent days - resulting in some unusual recommendations.

Customers hoping to buy some rope are also recommended whips, handcuffs and various types of bondage gear.

Time for some shut-eye? Other baby oil shoppers also purchased blindfolds and lube

While those wanted to purchase a balaclava are also pointed in the direction of baseball bats and knives.

And shoppers browsing for a set of pocket-sized scales were matched up with grip seal bags while those looking for a cigarette roller also found Rizlas and grinders were available.

Amazon's site states: 'The decision on which items are out together is based on same-day sales.

'So if item x and item y have been purchased on the same day by the same customer, they are counted. The item with the highest same-day sales will be displayed.'
