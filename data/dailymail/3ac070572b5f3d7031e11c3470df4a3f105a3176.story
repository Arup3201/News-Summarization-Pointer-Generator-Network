Millionaire fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood has suggested poorer people should 'eat less' so they can afford to buy organic food. 

The outspoken designer made the comments as she delivered a petition to Downing Street protesting about genetically modified food. 

When told that not everyone can afford to eat organic food she replied, saying: 'Eat less'.

Dame Vivienne Westwood made the remarks after delivering a petition to Downing Street warning British people of the dangers of GM food and farming 

Her comments drew criticism from the food bank charity Trussell Trust, which works to ensure everyone has access to food. 

Chris Mould, Trussell Trust Chairman told MailOnline: 'Every day Trussell Trust foodbanks provide thousands of people who are facing going hungry with three days' nutritionally balanced food. 

'The question for us is not about whether food is organic or not, it's about how we ensure that everyone has access to affordable, healthy food. 

'At the moment there are far too many people who are struggling to feed their families full stop, that is the challenge.' 

But today, Ms Westwood told MailOnline that people should 'eat less' meat and junk food. 

She said: 'I'm deeply upset if anyone would think I don't care about starving people or don't understand the terrible situation some people are in, quite the opposite, I have spent years campaigning for social and human rights issues. 

'My comments were related to eating less meat and junk food. 

'People are eating far too much factory farmed meat and junk food which is bad for you and doesn't provide the nutrients you need. 

'You can source good food and farmed meat for less.'

Ms Westwood, who is an ardent environmental campaigner, made the controversial remarks in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live after delivering the petition to Number 10.  

She spoke over an interview with Labour MP Michael Meacher to suggest people should 'eat less' so they can afford organic food.

She said: 'They don't have any choice that's the point. We have got all these processed food which is the main reason people are getting fat. 

'They're not actually good for you - they don't give you strength, they give you weight.

'I eat vegetables and fruit. I don't eat meat. I believe meat is bad for me - I don't eat it. It's also bad for the animals. But if there was a movement to produce more organic food and less of the horrible food, then organic food would obviously be a good value price, wouldn't it?'

Ms Westwood, who is part of British fashion history best-known for pioneering the punk look, has previously said that food prices should be increased because they do not reflect the impact that food manufacturing processes have on the environment. 

Last month she said that ‘clothes should cost more’, adding: ‘Food should cost more too. Something is wrong when you can buy a cooked chicken for £2.’

Despite making her fortune from selling clothes, she added: ‘Fashion is a terrible thing, it’s all about tempting to buy. But they should buy less.’

She has also previously said that being a vegetarian can cure the disabled.

Discussing the health benefits of choosing a veggie lifestyle, the fashion designer said people in wheelchairs have recovered due to a meat-free diet.

She also argued she living proof of the apparently miracle diet, claiming that it healed rheumatism in her finger.

'There are certain clinics where it is really strict vegetarian and there are people who have been in wheelchairs who have recovered from this diet,' she said.

'It does cure all kinds of things if you have a vegetarian diet,' she added. 'I used to have rheumatism — and I have a crocked finger.

'But now I don't have any rheumatic pain any more.'  

Miss Westwood lives in a smart townhouse in Clapham, south London with her husband Andreas Kronthaler, who is 25 years her junior.

In a 1989 issue of Tatler, Vivienne Westwood appeared on the magazine's cover dressed in a suit she had made for then prime minister Margaret Thatcher.

Her flame-hair conservatively coiffed, beneath the designer's image were the word: 'This woman used to be a punk'. Westwood's appearance on Tatler reportedly infuriated Mrs Thatcher. 

The edition has been hailed as one of the best British magazine covers of all time. 

In 1992, Westwood was awarded an OBE, which she collected from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. 

At the ceremony, Westwood was knicker-less, which was later captured by a photographer in the courtyard of Buckingham Palace. 

Years later, she sent a model down the catwalk yielding a sign in support of the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. 

It read: 'Fair trial my a***! Justice for the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Reprieve'  

Slowing down climate change and preventing fracking are other causes dear to the designer's heart. 

Elsewhere she has been pictured at Occupy London protests and visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy. 

This year, she cut off her hair because, according to her spokesman, 'we must all wake up to Climate Change.'

In September she used her packed London Fashion Week showcase to pledge her undivided support of the Yes campaign for Scottish independence.

Sending models sporting Yes badges down the runway, the designer left a statement explaining her views on every seat in the packed venue.

Later brandishing Better Together campaigners as 'frightened and stupid', Dame Vivienne said tearing the 307-year-old union apart could be 'the turning point towards a better world'.
