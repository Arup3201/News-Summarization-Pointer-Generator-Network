Two couples perished Thursday flying from their homes in South Florida to Virginia to attend a wedding.

The victims have been identified as Theodore Bradshaw, 61, and Mary Anne Bradshaw, 48 of Cooper City, Florida and Charles Rodd, 64, and Diane Rodd, 58, of Boynton Beach, Florida.

Mr Bradshaw was piloting the twin-propeller Cessna 340 when it took off Thursday morning from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport.

Lost: Charles and Diane Rodd were two of the passengers on a private flight that crashed in Virginia's Great Dismal Swamp on Thursday

What went wrong? The Cessna 340 plane was being piloted by 61-year-old Theodore Bradshaw who Virginia State Police say had 30 years of flying experience. The crash is still under investigation

The group was due to arrive at the Hampton Roads Executive Airport around noon, but the airport lost communication with the airplane about twenty miles away - on the Virginia side of the Great Dismal Swamp.

On Friday, the plane crash site was discovered by crews using a privately-owned helicopter.

Since the crash site is in such a remote and swampy area, crews had to work on Saturday clearing a path to the scene for vehicles.

Teams hope to recover the bodies of the pilot and three passengers on Sunday.

Authorities are still investigating what caused the crash

According to the Virignia State Police, Mr Bradshaw had 30 years of piloting experience. He was a retired firefighter with Sunrise Fire-Rescue.

The group was flying to Virignia to attend the wedding of his nephew. Apparently the two women on board were sisters.

According to passenger Charles Rodd's ex-wife Marie Rodd - he was a Vietnam veteran who served two tours of duty and earned two Purple Hearts.

'He was very patriotic. He was a wonderful husband, a wonderful father,' she told the Sun-Sentinel. 'He was a very nice friend.'

Mr Rodd also recently had lung cancer, but it had gone into remission.

Corinne Stephenson was Charles and Diane Rodd's next-door neighbors. She said they were 'wonderful neighbors' considerate enough to send her a get-well card during a recent hospital stay.

They were in the middle of a home renovation when the crash happened.

'They planned to stay there the rest of their lives.'

The crash is currently under investigation by the Virginia State Police, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board.
