A fridge that tells you when you’re running low on food? A remote control washing machine?

Suddenly doing the housework doesn’t seem like quite so much of a chore, thanks to LG’s line of HomeChat appliances.

The electronics company have created a washing machine, fridge and oven that you can communicate with via Line Messaging, a smartphone app which sends instant messages, similar to WhatsApp.

Well-stocked: LG's new HomeChat appliances will tell you via instant messaging service Line Messaging, how how food you have in your fridge

Technology is built into the appliances with which the app communicates, so by using the app users can communicate with their various gizmos as if they were just another contact in their phone book.

You can ask the appliance specific questions and provide additional information to alter their functions, which means you can be sitting at your desk at work whilst putting a load of washing on.

You’ll be able to use the app to simultaneously check the temperature inside your fridge as well as the status of how much milk is left.

Using its built-in camera, the fridge can scan its own contents and send you a damage report on request.

This remarkable technology, says Rocket News 24, also has the ability to tell the vacuum cleaner to run about the house looking for 
dust or turn the central heating down a few degrees.

Currently the HomeChat appliances are only available to buy in LG’s native South Korea, though LG have said they want to expand availability worldwide.

Fortunately, Samsung have it’s own version of the washing machine, and it’s available in Britain’s very own John Lewis for £1,699.

The WW9000 - available in two colours, white or graphite – follows the same experience as HomeChat.

You can pause or start a wash using your mobile device, plus get notifications telling you how long there is left and when a cycle has finished.

It also stores around a month’s worth of detergent, releasing with each wash the exact amount needed for the size of the load.

It also features a handy touchscreen and different programmes to target specific stains: The Gardening cycle shifts soil and grass stains whilst Cooking & Dining gets rid of food and grease marks.

And, thanks to it’s speed, a 2kg wash can be done in just 15 minutes.
