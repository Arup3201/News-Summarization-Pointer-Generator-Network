A homeless man has gone from the proverbial penthouse to the big house after he was found sleeping in the presidential suite at one of Pittsburgh's swankiest hotels on Tuesday night.

Jeffrey Lennon Watson, 48, was arrested at Omni William Penn Hotel and sent to jail after guests checking into their estimated $2500-a-night room found him sleeping on a couch about 7.30pm.

The rough sleeper told police he was from Los Angeles and was passing through the city to return to California.

He just needed a bed: Jeffrey Lennon Watson, 48, was arrested at Omni William Penn Hotel after guests checking into their estimated $2500-a-night room found the homeless man sleeping on a couch

Struggling: Watson told police 'he has been in Pittsburgh for over a month and sleeps wherever he can locate somewhere comfortable to rest his head'

Police said hotel security officers woke him up, took him to their office and called police.

Watson told police 'he has been in Pittsburgh for over a month and sleeps wherever he can locate somewhere comfortable to rest his head'.

The hotel's general manager, Eric DeStefano, said the presidential suite was programmed earlier that day to remain unlocked for an event.

'There was an isolated incident of an unregistered occupant being found in the parlor area of the Presidential Suite, which is a general-use area for receptions and small events,' DeStefano said in a statement, according to International Business Times.

This is one of the swanky rooms at the Omni William Penn hotel in Pittsburgh where a homeless man was found sleeping

Police took Watson to the Allegheny 
County Jail where he remains, unable to post $15,000 bond.

He
faces a preliminary hearing on November 19 on charges of criminal trespass and
theft of services.

It is not clear how long Watson was in the room or how he got in.

However, there aren't too many places more comfortable than Watson's chosen location.

The
16th-floor suite features a 1,300-square-foot parlor plus three 
bedrooms, and includes crystal chandeliers, a dining room, grand piano, a
full kitchenette, wet bar and sitting room, according to the hotel's 
website.
