Team news

Aston Villa 

Joe Cole and Carlos Sanchez are set to make their competitive Aston Villa debuts against Newcastle at Villa Park on Saturday.

Cole missed last week's opening-day 1-0 win at Stoke as he recovered from a thigh injury while Sanchez had only just signed from Elche.

But the Colombia international has trained this week and boss Paul Lambert has confirmed he is available for the Barclays Premier League clash with the Magpies.

Cole runnings: Joe Cole (centre) trains in the run up to a potential debut for Aston Villa at Villa Park

Jores Okore is also in contention after playing in an Under 21s game against Stoke on Monday. The defender suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury last September after just four appearances following his £4m arrival from FC Nordsjaelland.

Strikers Christian Benteke (achilles) and Libor Kozak (broken leg) remain sidelined.

Provisional squad: Guzan, Given, Baker, Vlaar, Okore, Clark, Senderos, Richardson, Hutton, Cissokho, Lowton, Stevens, Bacuna, El Ahmadi, Sanchez, Cole, Westwood, Delph, Herd, Gardner, N'Zogbia, Grealish, Weimann, Agbonlahor, Bent.

Newcastle 

Summer signing Siem de Jong could be handed a Barclays Premier League debut as Newcastle head for Aston Villa on Saturday.

Former Ajax midfielder De Jong is available after missing the opener against Manchester City with the foot injury he suffered in pre-season, and will be joined in the squad by loan striker Facundo Ferreyra for the first time.

On the bounce: Siem de Jong could be set to make his Newcastle debut at Aston Villa

Midfielder Cheick Tiote will sit out once again with a hamstring problem, while central defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa picked up a knock in training last week and full-back Davide Santon is unlikely to return to the squad until November after undergoing knee surgery during the closed season.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, Coloccini, Wiliamson, S Taylor, Anita, Abeid, Gouffran, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, De Jong, Obertan, Aarons, Riviere, Ferreyra, Perez.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Aston Villa have scored exactly one goal in six of their last seven Premier League games against Newcastle.

Newcastle have taken 13 points from their last five  Premier League encounters with Aston Villa.

Aston Villa have won only nine of their last 31 Premier League home games.

Newcastle drew only one of their 19 Premier League away games last season (W7 L11).

Having the edge: Newcastle's Loic Remy scored the winning goal when they last played Aston Villa in February

Newcastle have lost each of their last five Premier League away games. They last lost six in a row in March 2008.

Only one of Newcastle’s 43 goals in 2013-14 was scored by an English player.

Newcastle were the only team not to hit a shot on target on the opening weekend.

Andreas Weimann, who scored for Villa at Stoke last weekend, has scored the club’s last two Premier League goals at Villa Park.

Four of Villa’s last five Premier League goals at home have come before half-time.

Newcastle debutant Remy Cabella created three goalscoring chances last weekend, more than any of his team-mates.
