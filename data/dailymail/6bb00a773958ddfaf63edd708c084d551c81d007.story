A Massachusetts woman drove her minivan into the path of an oncoming train last night after following instructions given by her GPS device.

The mother, who was not identified, and her two children who were also in the vehicle managed to get out of the car before it was struck by the speeding locomotive, which left it a mangled mess.

The incident happened as the woman was driving southbound on Brighton Street in Belmont shortly before 9 p.m.

Just before she got to Hittenger Street, the navigation device indicated for her to take a right-hand turn, police said.

Following the instructions, he woman drove onto the Massachusetts Bay Transport Authority train tracks with the two children, aged 7 and 10, inside the car.

After she realized where the GPS had led her, she frantically tried to drive the minivan off the tracks, but she couldn't.

'Unfortunately the right hand turn positioned her vehicle onto the railroad tracks,' MBTA police said in a statement.

'After attempts to drive off the tracks were unsuccessful, the driver of the vehicle along with two minor children exited and moved away from the track area to a safe location.'

Smashed: The vehicle was severely damaged by the train

Moments later, a MBTA Fitchburg bound commuter rail train plowed through the car, leaving it looking as though it had gone through a compactor.

There were about 70 passengers on the train at the time of the crash ut no one was injured.

The driver was not cited, police said.

This wasn't the first time GPS has led a driver to danger.

Last summer, a South Attleborough, Massachusetts woman told police her navigation device directed her onto a train track in Brookline.

Her car got stuck on the tracks, but there were luckily no trains in the area at the time.
