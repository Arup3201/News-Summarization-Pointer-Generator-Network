To some teenage girls, their long locks are their most prized possession.

But that didn't stop 17 teenagers from Cheltenham Girls High in Sydney from shaving off their hair this morning - all in the name of charity.

And as if the task wasn't daunting enough - they even signed up to complete the challenge live on television, raising more than $30,000 (£16,480) for the Leukaemia Foundation.

Brave: 17 students from Cheltenham Girls shaved off their hair on live TV and raised more than $30,000 for the Leukaemia Foundation

Lifesavers: The money raised from this fundraising event will help people with blood cancer, Australia's second most common cause of cancer-related deaths

A Channel 9 spokeswoman said one of the girls burst into tears during the shave and had to be consoled by her parents afterwards.

'We actually had more of the parents crying than the girls themselves,' she said.

The annual World's Greatest Shave raises money for people with blood cancer.

Blood cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in Australia, with one person losing their life every two hours from the disease.

Mornings host Sonia Kruger said all the girls were extremely brave for raising funds and awareness in this way.

When Kruger asked 14-year-old Angela Tung if she was nervous about having her hair shaved off, she replied: 'Yeah a little bit, but there are plus sides so it's OK.'

Those said advantages included not accidentally getting her hair in her mouth anymore.

Kruger was then coerced by her co-host David Campbell to pick up the scissors and cut Angela's hair.

'There's so much hair!' she exclaimed, before handing the student her ponytail.

The teenager said the process was a lot easier knowing she had so much support around her.

'When I walked into class this morning everyone stood up and started clapping and cheering. It was really nice,' Angela said.

'Quite a few people have said it looks really good and hopefully I've inspired a few others to do the same next year because it's such a great cause.'

Angela alone raised $3,000 - well over what she was expecting from her family and friends..

'I was expecting a couple hundred at the most,' she said.

'Dad's workmates all chipped in so it was good.'

Cheltenham Girls High principal Susan Bridge said she was very proud of her students.

'They are so brave and they are so strong,' she said.

'They're such wonderful young women and they are doing it for such a wonderful cause. All of the girls have volunteered to have this done today in order to raise money for the Leukaemia Foundation.

Before going on air, the girls had raised $28,000 between them until Campbell announced Mornings and Boost Media would kick in an additional $2000.

One student said it felt 'kind of weird', while another said she was 'freaking out'.

'It feels a little odd not having hair,' she said.

'I'm not going to be able to spend 20 minutes doing my hair...it will take like two seconds.'
