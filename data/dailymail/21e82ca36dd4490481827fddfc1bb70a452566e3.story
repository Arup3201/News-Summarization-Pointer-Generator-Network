FA chairman Greg Dyke’s next stated ambition after his England Commission is to restructure the management of the FA. That doesn’t look like good news for the Club England set-up established by Sir Dave Richards in 2010 to run international football for the FA.

Two members of the Club England board, Sir Trevor Brooking and general secretary Alex Horne, have left or are leaving the FA. That gives Dyke the opening to disband the group and hand the responsibility of running England business to Dan Ashworth, technical director designate, and performance services chief Dave Reddin. They both impressed the main FA board with a presentation about the way forward for England after the World Cup debacle.

A perplexed Football League can’t help identify who is responsible for posting an advertisement in The Times offering a full-time professional football club for sale that owns the stadium and is situated in a ‘fast expanding city in England’. However, Milton Keynes, Peterborough, Plymouth and Coventry fit that description.

Whoever wins the race to host the 2024 Olympics can thank the Swedish Olympic Committee for bringing about the bid reform recommendations that were influential to the changes being rubber stamped in December. Sweden combined with Austria, Switzerland and Germany in formulating a document of proposals for future bids sent to IOC president Thomas Bach. And Sweden, who withdrew from bidding for the 2022 Winter Games, said they would have re-engaged in the process if the new regulations had come in earlier.

One wonders why American sports tycoon Josh Harris, owner of ice hockey’s New Jersey Devils and basketball’s Philadelphia 76ers, turned up at the recent Leaders in Sport conference when he was already well down the road in his Crystal Palace takeover and then denied any interest in acquiring a Premier League club.

A Koch and bull story

FIFA executive Alexander Koch made an extraordinary claim that temporary buildings are the only real cost of staging a World Cup and that FIFA spent three times more than Brazil on the 2014 tournament.

FIFA’s corporate communications manager told the Host City summit that $600m — the cost of temporary structures — was the real Brazil bill, while the governing body had forked out $1.7billion. FIFA’s spending for Russia 2018 is estimated at $2.1bn.

Koch said: ‘There is a complete misunderstanding of what are the costs of staging a World Cup. In Brazil every metro or bus line was put under the cost to get this number of $31bn. But what does this have to do with the World Cup? We don’t need a new bus line or changing a favela. It was never required. The temporary infrastructure, yes, that’s the only cost.’

Koch also added that Germany and South Africa had a vision of why they wanted a World Cup but FIFA were ‘still wondering’ what Brazil’s was — apart from winning it. Whatever Koch’s left-field views, FIFA still made a profit of $2.7bn from the Brazil tournament.
