A flight was forced to turn back because of a furious argument between a passenger and the crew over the price of a sandwich.

The Virgin flight had left Darwin, in northern Australia, for Perth today but trouble began when the man began shouting at flight attendants.

Passengers Kirsten and Claudia Lloyd told ABC News he eventually had to be handcuffed and taken to the back of the aircraft.

'It kind of started over a sandwich, I think,' one said.

'Yeah, $10 for a sandwich, I think it was. Then he got all hyped up and started pushing all the flight attendants down the aisle.'

The sandwich at fault is believed to be a gourmet chicken and salad sandwich, created with celebrity chef Luke Mangan.

According to the Virgin in-flight menu it costs 10 Australian dollars - the equivalent of around £6.50.

‘He was rambling, his behaviour was erratic and he was shouting,’ one passenger told the Northern Territory News.

‘It wasn’t mayhem, but he disturbed a few of the kids on board.’ 

When the captain heard that the man 
was still causing trouble and continuing to complain 
it was decided to abort the flight and return to Darwin.

Australian Federal Police, who are 
responsible for airport security, were waiting to arrest the man when 
flight DJ1432 touched down.

A spokesperson said he was taken to Royal Darwin Hospital due to concerns about his mental health.

A Virgin Australia spokesperson said the captain decided to return to Darwin because of the passenger's 'disruptive' behaviour.

She added that the plane would be ‘absorbed back into the flight schedule’ and 
passengers would arrive in Perth several hours late.
