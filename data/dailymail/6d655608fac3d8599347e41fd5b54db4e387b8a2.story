Suspect: Nurse Rebecca Leighton has been charged tonight and will appear before magistrates tomorrow

A nurse has been charged in connection with the death of five patients at Stepping Hill Hospital which is at the centre of a tampering probe, police said tonight.

Rebecca Leighton, 27, has been charged with six counts of causing damage with intent to endanger life. She will appear before magistrates in the morning.

If found guilty of the offences, the hospital worker faces a potential life sentence. A police investigation was launched after five unexplained deaths at the hospital.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said tonight: 'A woman arrested by detectives investigating five deaths at Stepping Hill hospital has been charged.

'Rebecca Leighton, of Heaviley, is charged with six counts under section one of the criminal damage act, causing damage with intent to endanger life or being reckless to whether life is being endangered.

'She is also charged with one count of theft of medicine from Stepping Hill Hospital.

'She is due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Saturday.'

Tonight police named Vera Pearson, 84, as the fifth victim to be linked to the investigation. Derek Weaver, 83, who died yesterday, has also been linked with the investigation.

She was not one of the 14 patients police 
initially believed had been treated with 36 vials of saline contaminated
with insulin.

The pensioner's family said they wanted to be left alone to grieve in peace. Detectives are expected to continue to investigate the case over the coming days.

Detectives had been given until 9pm 
tonight to continue to question nurse Rebecca Leighton as they investigated the deaths of George Keep, 84, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and 
Tracey Arden, 44.

Miss Leighton, 27 - herself born at Stepping Hill - was described by colleagues as 'dedicated'.

She
was arrested at 6am on Wednesday in the flat she shares with her fianc√©
Tim Papworth, 28, a 15-minute walk from Stepping Hill.

Chris Burke, chief executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are aware that Greater Manchester Police have charged the 27 year old female suspect.

'Our thoughts are with the families affected by this incident. All of the staff here are extremely shocked and appalled by what has happened and we have ensured there is appropriate support available.'

Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West, said: 'These are serious charges that relate to allegations that Rebecca Leighton tampered with medical products, saline ampoules and saline bags in Stepping Hill Hospital and by doing so endangered the lives of patients.

'This is a complex, ongoing police investigation. We will continue to work with police and provide advice as they continue their detailed inquiries. We will of course review any further evidence they provide to us and decide whether any further charges should be brought.'

Miss Leighton was registered as a nurse in 2008.

Mr Weaver, who died yesterday, was a retired businessman who lived near the hospital.

He
is understood to have deteriorated suddenly after suffering a serious 
low blood sugar episode on July 11, the day before the inquiry was 
launched.

Last night Mr Weaver's sister, Lynda Bleasdale, said: 'Everyone in the hospital has said what a charming, lovely gentleman he is. The staff have been absolutely wonderful with him.'
