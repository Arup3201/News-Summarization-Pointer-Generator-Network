Savvy supermarket shoppers often buy in bulk in order to get the best deal.

But larger ‘value packs’ may not always beat smaller ones on price, according to a study by the website canieatit.co.uk.

It found that Tesco customers buying two boxes of six Happy Eggs at £1.98 each, rather than a large box of ten at £3.49, were paying 33p per egg instead of 35p.

Discrepancy: The study found that six-packs of Happy Eggs in Tesco, and 70cl bottles of Gordon's gin in Morrisons, were better value than larger containers of the same product

And a litre of  Gordon’s Special Dry London Gin at Morrisons cost £21.29 or £2.13 per 100ml, which is more expensive than a 70cl bottle costing £13.00, or £1.85 per 100ml.

Website founder Martin Isark said: ‘Supermarkets know shoppers automatically grab bigger packs, so when they feel they can get  away with it they make them the most expensive.’

Last year a survey revealed that supermarkets were selling wine for artificially high prices in order to make discounts seem more appealing.

One store marketed a pinot grigio as ‘33 per cent off’, when it had only been sold at the higher price for 16 days in the year.
