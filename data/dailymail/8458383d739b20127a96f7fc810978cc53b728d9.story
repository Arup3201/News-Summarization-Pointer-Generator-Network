England’s players were forced to train on Wednesday against a deafening back-drop of Welsh singing blaring from speakers, as they desperately strive to avoid a repeat of their 2013 calamity in Cardiff.

The national team’s state-of-the-art headquarters in Surrey resounded to the sound of Welsh folk singer Max Boyce’s Hymns and Arias, which has been adopted by fans as one of their anthems, to replicate the fervent din they will face at the Millennium Stadium tomorrow night.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster used the ploy to prepare his squad for the RBS Six Nations opener, as part of a drive to combat the partisan atmosphere which is likely to include a refusal to have the roof closed for the game.

Two years ago, England slumped to a record 30-3 defeat in the Welsh capital and they are on guard about the threat of another noisy ambush. ‘One of the bits of feedback we gave the players before the game two years ago was that the acoustics of the stadium are so loud that sometimes you can’t hear the communication on the field,’ said Lancaster. ‘Mike Catt kept repeatedly saying this and all the players nodded their heads, but until they had actually experienced it, they didn’t really know.’

Asked about the loud playing of Welsh songs, he added: ‘I didn’t want to leave it to chance this time around. It was only for 10 minutes but I wanted them to get the sense of what it feels like to play there. We did some phase play attack without the players being able to hear themselves think. We have eight players who haven’t played in the Millennium Stadium before, so it was preparation.’

George Ford, the England fly-half, understood the reasoning behind the musical accompaniment to training, saying: ‘We expect it to be loud and a good atmosphere, so it was important to practise under those situations, because we want the communication to be good.’

The Bath No 10 isn’t concerned if he is booed when he is lining up goal-kicks, adding: ‘It doesn’t make it easier or harder if it’s noisy. You’re in your own little bubble, concentrating on the kick.’

Wales have expressed a desire for the Millennium Stadium roof to be closed on Friday night, but England are destined to exercise their right to veto the move. Lancaster said: ‘It looks like it is set fair and if it is, then we will probably want it open. It’s forecast to be dry and part of the reason you’d have a roof is to keep the conditions dry. If it’s going to be dry, why do you need a roof?’ The head coach rejected the notion that having the roof open would dilute the atmosphere, adding: ‘It’s going to be pretty noisy anyway.’

Wales assistant coach Rob Howley reacted to news of England’s training soundtrack by arguing that it is evidence of their ‘meticulous’ approach. He also suggested that it is up to the home team to inspire the crowd to make a difference, saying: ‘We all talk about the cauldron, but that stadium is only as good as the players’ performance.’

However, Wales’ Lions full back, Leigh Halfpenny, has urged home fans to replicate the crescendo they produced in 2013.

‘That anthem two years ago was the loudest I’ve ever heard it,’ he said. ‘Running out into that packed Millennium Stadium is the best feeling ever and the crowd were just incredible. It gave us that buzz going into game. There is always that buzz about Wales v England and the history that goes with it.’
