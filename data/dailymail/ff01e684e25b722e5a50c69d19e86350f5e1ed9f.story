Scientists have been left stumped by a giant jellyfish with no tentacles that was found off the coast of Australia.

The huge creature, called Keesingia giga, has been described by experts as extremely venomous and 'as long as a human arm'.

It is thought to cause Irukandji syndrome, a condition that can be fatal to humans.

A giant new species of lethal jellyfish discovered in Australian waters. Keesingia gigas (shown) are gargantuan members of the Irukandji jellyfish family. They can grow to be as long as a human arm, but other members of its genus are only as big as a fingernail

The jellyfish was found off the north-west coast of Western Australia by Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin, the director of Marine Stinger Advisory Services in Queensland reports The Guardian.

It is a species of Irukandji jelly, which are normally only about as big as a fingernail in size.

Keesingia gigas, however, was found to be almost as big as a person’s arm. 

Such animals have been spotted before but a specimen was not captured until 2013.

‘It is absolutely humongous - the body is about 30 to 50 centimetres [12 to 20 inches] tall... It's an absolute whopper of a jellyfish,’ Dr Gershwin told ABC Australia.

In her paper discussing the species, she mentions how the sting of the jellyfish has been studied previously.

In one instance a person was struck with severe Irukandji syndrome, while another victim had just local and groin pain.

In the past Irukandji syndrome has been fatal in humans, as it can cause strokes or heart failures in addition to nausea and vomiting.

Scientists are confused as the jellyfish has been found with no tentacles (seen in picture). It is also known to carry a powerful venom that can cause Irukandji syndrome. This can cause nausea and vomiting and in some instances can even be fatal in humans

For
 those who do get stung by a jellyfish, treatments vary according to the
 nature of the sting and which type of jellyfish is responsible.

‘The
 most important thing to remember is that when you are stung the 
jellyfish usually leaves its tentacle on you, so you should wash the 
wound and add ice,' says Dr Peter Richardson, director of the Marine 
Conservation Society’s biodiversity programme.

Taking
 antihistamines, scraping the skin with a (not-too-sharp) knife edge and
 applying iced water to the injured area are just three methods used to 
soothe injuries.

There’s
 no ‘miracle cure’ for a jellyfish sting. Urinating on the wound does 
not help - although it is widely believed that it does.

But
 if you are stung by a particularly venomous jellyfish like a box 
jellyfish overseas - or even a Lion’s Mane here in Britain - you must 
seek medical attention. 

Every Kessingia gigas that has been found so far, however, has been seen to have no tentacles - leading to some confusion.

It is widely accepted that the sting is transmitted through tentacles, so quite how this creature performs an attack is a mystery.

‘Jellyfish always have tentacles...that’s how they catch their food. The tentacles are where they concentrate their stinging cells,' Dr Gershwin told the Australian Assocaited Press.

'I think probably it does have tentacles but by random chance the specimens that we photographed and obtained don’t have them anymore.'

This could have been because it sheds them on a regular occasions as a defence mechanism, Dr Gershwin added.

'I think it's probably a fairly tame explanation - I just don't know what it is.'

A spokesperson from the Marine Conservation Society, meanwhile, tells MailOnline: 'Clearly there is enough toxin in the stinging cells in the bell of this jellyfish to negate the need for tentacles that are used to physically "capture" or "hold onto" prey.

'Many species evolve in different ways and there are many different ways to survive as an "ocean drifter".

'Clearly this jellyfish has developed the necessary tools to capture and deal with prey that allows it survive very well in the open water environment.'

And Dr Jane Fromont of the Western Australian Museum, where the species will be kept, has warmed that swimmers should be wary of these creatures in future.

However, it is not necessarily the size of the jellyfish that should be feared - previous Irukandji jellyfish that have killed humans have been known to be as small as a peanut.

Pictured here is a Malo kingi jellyfish, part of the same family as Keesingia gigas, which has been known to kill a human. Irukandji jellyfish are normally about this size, that of a fingernail, making the recent finding of Keesingia gigas all the more astounding
