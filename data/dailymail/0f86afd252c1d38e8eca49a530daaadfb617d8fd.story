The sight of mounted police units could be banished to the history books after a number of forces revealed they had scrapped the use of police horses to save money.

The units, commonly used to police large events such as football matches, are under threat as police forces across the country try to make savings in light of budgetary cutbacks.

The decision has been criticised as 'myopic' by policing bodies who said that the closure of police units is 'too important to lose completely'.

Police horses were widely used across the country to police last summer's riots, leading some officers to question the decision to close the units to make savings.

Nottinghamshire and Essex Police forces decided to get rid of their stables earlier this year, while three other forces are reported to be relocating their stables into one amalgamated operation at a separate location.

It is thought that South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Humberside police forces have decided to amalgamate their operations, which could lead to a decrease in the size of the individual units.

The cutbacks have prompted the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) to consider commissioning a study aimed at protecting the UK's remaining 14 mounted patrols.

The study, which would be carried out by 
two academics from Oxford University,  would look at the cost of the 
units and hope to show how they deal with public order offences.

Acpo's Rod Hansen said that a study would emphasise the value of mounted patrols to UK policing.

The Police Federation's Rick Nelson said that closing forces had already lost 'invaluable experience forever' and said police horses were 'essential' for effective policing.

Speaking to The Independent, Mr Nelson said: 'To reduce or disband mounted branches is extremely myopic.

'Once numbers fall below a certain level, we will have lost invaluable experience forever and it will be hard to regain the experience which we as a federation believe is essential for even basic quality policing of big public order events or high pro-file policing.

'On occasions savings of this type may end up costing the service more in the long run.

'Police horses at football and other public order situations or high profile community can reduce the total number of officers required at the event considerably.'

Nottinghamshire's unit was disbanded earlier this year, reportedly saving the force £105,000 a year.

'Four of the serving horses have been retired to private homes or went to sanctuaries,' said a spokesman.

'The remaining three continue in active service with Greater Manchester, South Wales and City of London.'

Essex Police announced it was to disband the unit in October, blaming 'increasing financial pressures'.

The force said the cutbacks would save approximately £600,000 but said that it made the decision with 'great reluctance'.

Assistant Chief Constable Sue Harrison 
said: 'We know that the public, police officers and staff hold the 
Mounted Section in great affection and the unit has provided great 
service over the years.

'However the financial pressures we face need to be met head on and inevitably difficult decisions have to be made.

'The
disbanding of the Mounted Section will lead to approximately £600,000 
of savings annually and the decision to remove these posts is part of 
the on-going planned reduction of police officer numbers over the four 
year Reform change programme.

'Officers based within the unit will take up new roles elsewhere in the force and staff members will be eligible for redeployment.

'A detailed plan for the disbanding of the unit is now being progressed. If we were not to have taken this decision, then Essex Police would have had to lose an even greater number of officer posts from across the force.

'Securing a good home for the horses will continue to be paramount and we will explore all avenues to achieve this including transferring them to other forces.'

Police horses were first used in London in 1760, when Sir John Fielding, the Bow Street magistrate, developed a plan to introduce mounted units in order to deal with highwaymen.

The initial introduction of eight horses proved so successful that a patrol of more than 50 horses was put in place in 1805.

Wearing red waistcoats, blue coats and trousers, the Bow Street Horse Patrol gave protection on all major roads within 20 miles of Charing Cross.

While police horses are now associated with patrolling large public events, they were once used to protect people from thieves while transporting livestock.

Guards atop the horses often carried a sword and revolver.

Mounted police officers have been used by police in West Yorkshire since the early 1890s.

The modern-day Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch was established in 1919 when Lt Col Laurie, the ex-Commanding officer of the Royal Scots Grey Regiment, became Assistant Commissioner of the Met.

A white police horse named Billy helped clear fans off the pitch at the FA Cup final at Wembley in 1923 after a pitch invasion.

The game has since been referred to as the White Horse Final. Its rider, PC George Scorey received one of  Billy's hooves, which was polished and mounted, when the horse died in 1930.

Horses usually retire between 18 and 20 years of age, where they can usually expect to retire to a long-term home.

David Cameron was left embarrassed earlier this year when he admitted riding a police horse lent to former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks.

There are currently 286 horses used by police across 14 mounted units in England, Scotland and Wales.
