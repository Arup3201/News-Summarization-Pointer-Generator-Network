Three children and two teachers murdered in last week's Connecticut elementary school shooting are being laid to rest today, along with six others who are being memorialized.

Western Connecticut has been inundated with funerals as the community continues to bury the 20 first grade students and and six adults gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School last Friday. 

Six other wakes and memorial services are scheduled today for the victims - just the latest in a long series of ceremonies for the 26 dead in the horrifying rampage that shook the small community - and the nation - to its core.

A wake for six-year-old Jesse Lewis
at Newtown's only funeral home clogged the streets of the city's 
downtown - a daily occurrence since services for the victims began on 
Monday.
