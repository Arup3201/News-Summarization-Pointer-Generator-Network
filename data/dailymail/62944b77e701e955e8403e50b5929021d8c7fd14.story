Arsenal scout Brian McDermott was at Espanyol against Valencia on Tuesday evening as he ran the rule over Hector Moreno. 

The 26-year-old Mexico international has been a target for Tottenham, Swansea, Everton and Hull in recent seasons.

However it is thought Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is keen to sign the 57 time capped centre back to bolster his defence.

Moreno starred for Mexico in the World Cup last summer but Wenger will have to fend of interest from Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, who worked with the 26-year-old during his time at Espanyol.

The Mexican has been limited to only five first-team appearances for the La Liga outfit this season having recovered from a broken leg.

Wenger looks set to be active in the January transfer window, especially after Mathieu Debuchy dislocated his shoulder at the weekend against Stoke. 

Debuchy will see a specialist in the next 48 hours to establish whether an operation is required, and if so he could miss three more months of the season. 

Moreno, with 57 caps, would provide the Arsenal back line plenty of top level experience
