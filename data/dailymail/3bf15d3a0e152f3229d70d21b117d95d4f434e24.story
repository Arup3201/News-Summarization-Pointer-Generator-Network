A gang of robbers have today been jailed for ransacking a jeweller’s home before bundling him into his own car and taking him to his own showroom so they could steal nearly £100,000 pounds worth of gems.

Damon Denham, Stephen Evers and Eugene Gunderman burst into Mark Reid’s house, in Ockham, Surrey, tied him up, put a pillowcase over his head and then plundered £22,000 worth of jewellery from his personal collection. 

They then drove the 48-year-old victim to Gordon Marks Silver and Goldsmiths, in nearby Cobham, in his own car and forced him to unlock the shop.

The group barged in and smashed open display cases with a crowbar to get to the diamond jewellery inside. 

Sentenced: Stephen Evers, 42 (left), and Damon Denham, 27 (right), were jailed for 13-and-a-half years each after they broke into Mark Reid's house in Ockham, Surrey, before stealing £100,000 worth of gems

With them distracted by the shiny trinkets, Mr Reid seized his chance and fled into the road, shouting for help.

Jailing the trio for a total of 39 years at Guildford Crown Court, Judge Peter Moss said of the victim’s ordeal: 'It’s difficult to imagine how terrifying that must have been.'

A DNA sample from a crowbar at the shop matched 27-year-old Denham, while another from Mr Reid’s jeans from his bedroom matched 42-year-old Evers. 

Jurors during the trial heard that Mr Reid had been home alone in his large, detached house on the evening of October 14, 2012.

He was sitting on the sofa, watching television, when the gang struck.

Prosecutor Graham Smith told the court: 'Without warning, he was confronted by several intruders, bursting through his patio windows. These men were wearing balaclavas, dark clothing and gloves.'

The robbers had hurled two concrete breeze blocks through the double-glazed doors before piling in to the building.

Driver: Eugene Gunderman, 27, was jailed for 12-and-a-half years for his part in the terrifying double raid

The shocked victim leaped up and tried to flee the men up the stairs to his bedroom, where he had a panic alarm button.

The victim himself later told the court: 'Two of them were fast behind me. I got to my bedroom. There are two bolts on the door. I just got to the bolt and a crowbar came through and separated the door.

'They pushed the door open. They kicked me a couple of times and trod on my arm and said: ‘Don’t mess about’.'

They tied his hands, placed a pillow case over his head and then rifled through his entire house, tearing a grandfather clock from the wall and taking a bronze sculpture.

One man held what Mr Reid thought was a knife to his leg as he told them he did not have a safe.

In total they stole about £22,000 pounds worth of items from his house.

Mr Smith said: 'Whilst at the house they started asking him about the jewellery shop, whether there were valuables there. He had not mentioned he had a jewellery shop.'

They bundled him into his Toyota iQ and, with him and at least three of them in the vehicle, drove to his shop, where one of them cut the tie to allow Mr Reid to unlock his business.

He went to get keys to unlock the silverware cases but one robber told him: 'I don’t want that s***. Let’s go for the big stuff.'

But as he fumbled for the right keys in the dark, the thieves began forcing the cases open with crowbars. Mr Reid was left in the dark.

'I thought: "No one’s watching me" and I legged it,' he said. They took £98,700 pounds worth of jewels.

Mobile phone analysis revealed calls between Denham and Gunderman, 27, and also that Denham and Evers had both called the same two phone numbers around the time of the raid.

Some of the jewellery was recovered after Gunderman had given it as presents to his then girlfriend, Danielle Church.

Plundered: The gang forced a terrified Mr Reid to open up Gordon Marks Silver and Goldsmiths in Cobham, Surrey, before they barged in and smashed the display cabinets with a crow bar 

The judge told the trio: 'It’s totally plain that this was a professional operation, a gang operating for high stakes, at night, with careful planning. You were all party to a professionally planned and organised robbery of the most serious kind.

'I bear in mind this (charge) was a conspiracy to rob but it was a conspiracy which was carried through completely.'

Yet he added: 'I cannot and do not sentence any of you as taking a leading role in this.'

All three men had criminal records but none for anything similar to this offence.

The judge jailed Denham, from Old Windsor, Berkshire, and Evers, Feltham, Middlesex, for 13-and-a-half years, and reduced the sentence for Gunderman, of Queens Close, Old Windsor, to 12 years because of his guilty plea. 

Afterwards Detective Inspector from Surrey Police, Jake Nuttall said: 'The sentences handed out to Denham, Evers and Gunderman reflect the severity of the incident, which was a terrifying and traumatic experience for the victim.'

Denham and Evers had both denied the charge of conspiracy to rob, claiming cross-contamination was behind the genetic evidence.

Gunderman admitted the charge on the first day of trial but on the basis that he had driven others to a location near the house.

He abandoned this basis after Judge Moss suggested it was implausible.
