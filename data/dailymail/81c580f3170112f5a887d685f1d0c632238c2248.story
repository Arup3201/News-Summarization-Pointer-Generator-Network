An entire shoal of fish has been frozen mid-swim off the coast of Norway.

Thanks to a sharp eastern wind, part of the ocean froze near Lovund, a small island just a few miles from the northern shores of the Norway mainland.

It was only -7.8 degrees, but the wind made wind chill cold enough to freeze the large amount of fish in place.

The fish frozen in their shoal off of the coast of Lovund, a small island on the Northern coast of Norway, in ice so thick walkers have been able to safely take their dog out for a walk on it

Aril Slotte of the Norwegian marine research institute Havforskningsinstituttet told the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) that he thinks the fish were being chased by a predator, which have made them group up in such big numbers.

Ingolf Kristiansen said that because the ice was so frozen, no birds were able to fish in the seas.

This is not the first instance of an animal being caught frozen in a Norweigian body of water.

An elk was found frozen solid after falling through the icy surface of a Norwegian lake, found half visible above the ice.

It appears as though it was trying to cross the ice, when it cracked, trapping the elk in the freezing water.

Inger Sj√∏berg, 47, found the animal as she was skating across the lake, reported The Local.

'I was out skating with my boyfriend, and we saw something dark on the ice,' she told the Norway edition of the English language website.

'I thought it was some wood or some grass or something, and when we looked at it, we saw that it was an elk. I have never seen it before, a frozen animal in the ice.'

'We had to go out a bit from land, so the ice was strong enough when he started to walk, but then further out it was not strong enough. It's part of nature that animals die in this way.'

But it's not just large animals that have trouble with the frigid Norwegian winters, as smaller animals like frogs have been stopped in their tracks by freezing temperatures.

It was thought that this frog was crossing lake ice near Oslo to try and seek out a mate, but was frozen solid in the process.

The winter weather in Norway is some of the coldest in the world, with temperatures in inland areas sometimes reaching -40 degrees.

The coldest temperature ever recorded in Norway was around -52 degrees in 1886 in one of the northernmost towns in the country.
