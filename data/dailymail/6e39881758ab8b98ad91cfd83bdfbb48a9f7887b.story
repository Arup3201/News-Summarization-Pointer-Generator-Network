Though best known for her role as Sex And The City's vivacious, hyper-sexual Samantha, 56-year-old actress Kim Catrrall has revealed she has less in common with her most famous character than most people think.

Speaking to Woman & Home magazine, Cattrall, 56, said she likes to 'step outside of what people's idea of me might be', adding that the men in her life see her as the person she is, rather than the characters she has played.

In the interview the actress also discussed staying in shape, admitting that she has 'been on a diet since 1974', and that as she gets older she has to work harder to stay in shape.

Kim Cattrall gives an open interview to Women & Home, explaining that she isn't really looking for a man, but the qualities she values in men are intelligence, humour and compatibility

The blonde star said: 'I 
take care of myself, which includes dieting, exercising and minimising 
stress. I joke that I've been on a diet since 1974, which is basically 
true.

'I like to eat, and my body type is not naturally this thin, 
especially at this age. So I do watch what I eat and drink but I'm not 
obsessive - it's just a way of life.

'So I don't have dessert after every
 meal - I just can't do it. I have a big appetite, and staying on top of
 that is about knowing myself and saying, "I can eat that today but 
tomorrow I'm not going to."

'And I'm always aware - from gaining and 
losing weight for parts - that the time in the gym trying to lose extra weight is really hard work! I always have that in my mind.'

Cattrall explained that she works out every other day and does cardiovascular exercise three or four times a week: 'I've had injuries in the past, so I also do "physio yoga" - a 
combination of physio and yoga, so I'm constantly trying to rehabilitate
 my body.

'The older I get, the less jarring I want my exercise to be, 
and I find that a long walk is equally as helpful and satisfying as a 
three-mile jog.'

She said: 'And I'm always aware - from gaining and
 
losing weight for parts - that the time in the gym trying to lose extra 
weight is really hard work! I always have that in my mind'

Speaking about her relationships with men, Cattrall - who has been married three times and gone through two divorces and one annulment - said: and divorced three times, said: 'I
 don't know if men are intimidated by me - you'll have to ask men!

'If my
 accomplishments frighten someone, it's nothing to do with me - that's 
to do with them. But the men who are in my life see me as a person - as a
 woman - not as a character I've played.

'My male friends don't seem to 
have any feelings of intimidation that I'm a 100-watt sex bomb  standing
 next to them; they are able to distinguish between the Kim that is 
their friend, and the characters I have played.'

She added: 'I'm
 not really looking for a man. But the qualities I value in a man are 
intelligence, humour and compatibility - someone who has a temperament 
that works with mine. I'm not volatile. My professional life has a lot of ups and downs but in my personal life, I'm pretty easy-going.'

Cattrall also discussed her relationship with her parents, secretary Gladys Shane and construction engineer Dennis Cattrall, who emigrated to BC in Canada from Liverpool when Cattrall was three months old.

She said: 'My
 mother and my two aunts were a huge influence. I come from a family of 
four children, and three of them, including me, are women.

'Most of my 
teachers and mentors have been women - it's what I was exposed to. My 
father travelled a lot when I was young and my mother was always there -
 so that was where I got my consistency and my values from, more than from my father's side.

But
 I was very close to my father. They say that children need their 
mother, but I think that children need their mother and their father - 
particularly later in life. When I started to go away to school and 
jobs, that was when I needed my father.

'My
 father, who died last year, had dementia. You don't ever get over that.
 When you lose someone you love, you never get over it. You celebrate 
your memories of them. You never let it go.'

In the candid interview Cattrall also explained how the roles she wishes to play have changed over the years, admitting 'when
 I hit my forties I thought, "I canâ€™t play a sexy siren any more".'

She said: 'Almost 20 years later, it's still going on. I think that's because given
 a I like to step outside of what people's idea of me might be.

'I 
suppose that makes me a bit of a rule breaker. I like to take chances 
and make choices that sometimes feel like climbing a mountain.

'Such as 
coming to the West End in 2005 when I was thought of as a TV actress, 
then going on to work in some terrific theatres with great directors.

'My
 generation and the one before me had the freedom to make up our own 
rules.

'There has been a huge change over the past 15 years of what a 
woman in her fifties and sixties can be - we're much more open to 
choice.

'We're taking much better care of ourselves; we are all healthier
 and living longer, and creating lives for ourselves that are more than 
our mothers had.

'So there is more opportunity - and women are not 
beholden to a man or even a job to get fulfilment.'
