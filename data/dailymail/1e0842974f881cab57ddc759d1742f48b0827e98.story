Christian Eriksen insists Tottenham Hotspur have the characters in their dressing room to put the club's reputation as perennial bottlers to bed and qualify for the Champions League.

Spurs face Leicester City at White Hart Lane on Saturday, six points behind fourth-placed Manchester United but with two of their top four rivals in Liverpool and United set to face each other at Anfield on Sunday.

And Eriksen says he is desperate to change the perception of Tottenham as the sort of team that fail to live up to their expectations after defeat by Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final this month.

'We can change the reputation, I really think so,' Eriksen said. 'We have a really young team and people can still develop into something better. Hopefully, it will go in the right direction and, definitely, we have to show we can be a team to cross the line.

'It helped that we played the final, with the pressure. Everybody got in the mood and I don’t think anybody wants that feeling of losing again – exhausted and still just moaning because we could have done better. That helped everyone to take a look at what is needed at the top level and in important games.'

While many are almost counting Spurs out of the race for the Champions League after a run of form that has seen them take just seven points from a possible 15 in a crucial period in the Barclays Premier League, Eriksen still believes Mauricio Pochettino's young side can find themselves at Europe's top table next season.

'We’ve still got nine games to go,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You lose one game and you are supposedly out of it. You win one and you are in again. So, hopefully, we will keep winning and we will see where we are.

'Everybody who has played in the Champions League knows that the feeling is different. Right now you sit at home and you watch it on the TV, and then you speak about it the next day. It’s just about the Champions League, "did you see this? Did you see that?" It gives you such a boost to play in the Champions League.'
