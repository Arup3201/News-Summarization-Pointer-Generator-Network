The Electoral Commission has splashed out nearly £54,000 on a website warning people that if they fail to register to vote, they face being ‘vaporised’ by a giant cat with laser eyes.

Would-be voters are asked to type in their postcode on the website, ItsYourVote.org.uk.

They are then given a visual simulation of how their neighbourhood can be laser-beamed away by a huge ginger cat, wiped out by a giant ice cream scoop or flung into the air by massive mechanical claws.

Would-be voters are not to register or 'they may as well be vaporised by Catzilla's rainbow lasers

The website is meant to convince voters that not registering to vote will bring disaster to their postcode.

It warns: ‘Register to vote now or come election time you may as well be vaporised by Catzilla’s rainbow lasers.’

The Electoral Commission confirmed that it cost £46,483 to design and a further £7,369 to maintain for high end advertising agency DLKW Lowe to design the website.

Taxpayers have so far been billed £53,852, according to a Freedom of Information request by The Commentator website.

The Electoral Commission said that the website had received 20,000 hits with 5,000 going on another website, Aboutmyvote.co.uk, where they can download a voter registration form.

It is not known how many of them then went on to download, print and post the form to register, however.

If all 5,000 visitors to the page went on to register, the cost would be more than £10 per registered  voter.

The website was condemned as an expensive gimmick by the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be astounded that more than £50,000 of their cash has been spent on this gimmicky website.

'Whilst encouraging voter registration may be important, most people will struggle to believe that this bizarre project is the right way to do it, let alone being value for taxpayers’ money.’

But a spokesman for the Electoral Commission defended the expenditure, saying it was ‘important to reach out to young voters’ in a ‘creative’ way.

Many of the visitors to the website had come through Facebook, he added.

‘Only 56 per cent of 19 to 24 year-olds are registered to vote compared to 94 per cent for those aged 65 and over. We recognise that we need to reach out to young people.’

The spokesman added that the Electoral Commission would review the ‘success’ and ‘learn any lessons’ of the website after the local elections on May 2.
