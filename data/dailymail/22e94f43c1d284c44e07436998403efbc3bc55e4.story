Two women accused of drug smuggling in Peru could serve their sentences in the UK if Britain agrees to a transfer, Peruvian prosecutors said.

Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check-in for a flight from Lima to Madrid, on August 6.

The women claimed they were kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families.

But this week, they suggested they would plead guilty in order to secure shorter sentences, after conceding that detectives did not believe their story.

They are expected to receive a sentence of six years and eight months if they admit drug trafficking at their next court hearing.

Now, Peruvian counter narcotics prosecutor Luis Mendoza has said the women could apply to serve their sentences in Britain.

He said: 'It's very possible that they may complete their sentence in the United Kingdom.'

Miss Reid's father William, 53, from Glasgow, claimed they would apply for her to be moved to a UK prison at the earliest opportunity, saying: 'We could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland.'

But a legal source close to the case told the Mail a transfer could take many years, by which time they could be free.

The women are expected to serve 
two-and-a-half years of a six-year-and-eight-month sentence, after which
time they can apply to serve their parole in Britain anyway.

The source said: 'The process is very slow.

'There
are two British men in jail for drug smuggling in Peru right now, who 
have been trying for several years to be transferred back home to 
complete their sentence there.

'It
is a very long process and Britain does not often agree to it. It is 
not in their interest to. Why would they want them in their prisons?'

A
2008 Peruvian law gives foreigners the option to serve sentences back 
home, and Britain has a prisoner transfer agreement with Lima.

Miss Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly, from Northern Ireland, will need to show they behaved well in jail, pass 'legal, social, medical and psychological tests' and can fund their own tickets back.

They are currently being held in the tough Virgen de Fatima prison, on the outskirts of Lima.

Charities warn of dire conditions and claim poorer inmates are forced to prostitute themselves in return for food.

However, Miss Reid has compared it to a 'Brownie camp', and said she spent a whole day helping Miss McCollum Connolly to dye her hair brown and take out her hair extensions.

Hope: William Reid, father of Melissa, believes he can start the ball rolling to get his daughter moved to Glasgow. Pictured here on Daybreak earlier this month
