The manipulation of Libor by Barclays is likely to be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ in terms of fraudulent activities by banks, according to a former head of the U.S. securities regulator.

Hervey Pitt, the former chairman of the Washington-based Securities and Exchange Commission, said: ‘It is in Barclays’ interest to prove the old adage that misery loves company and I expect they’ll be implicating a lot of their colleagues in other banks.

‘This is the proverbial tip of the iceberg.’

Dramatic: Shares in RBS Group were hit hard as details of the Barclays penalty rattled the banking sector

Barclays was fined £130million by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the largest penalty ever by the agency.

It has also agreed to pay £100million to the US Justice Department, whose criminal investigation continues.

The U.S. Justice Department decided to levy the fine rather than pursue litigation against Barclays.

Mr Pitt said this was a matter of ‘taking the bird in hand’ rather than risk taking action through the courts.

The £230million in fines in the U.S. 
makes up most of the £292million levied on Barclays and its subsidiaries
 on both sides of the Atlantic, following an agreement between 
regulators in Washington and London.

Speaking to Bloomberg Television, Mr 
Pitt continued: ‘This is a phenomenal example of the ability of both the
 UK and the U.S. authorities to work together.

‘This really should give marketplace 
participants a lot of hope, and for those who are thinking of violating 
the law a lot of fear, that different governments will work together 
constructively and come up with cases of this nature.’

The massive fines are unlikely to be 
the end of the pain for Barclays.

The cost of lawsuits related to the 
Libor scandal are likely to be bigger, according to Sandy Chen, banking 
analyst at Cenkos Securities.

He added: ‘Since Royal Bank of 
Scotland, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group have also been named in 
lawsuits, we expect they will also face significant fines and damages.

‘We are pencilling in multi-year provisions that could run into the billions.’

The Barclays case follows co-ordinated
 investigations lasting years and is just the first in a series of 
potential cases against other financial firms, including HSBC, Citigroup
 and JPMorgan Chase.

American regulators have issued 
subpoenas to banks including UBS, Citigroup, and Bank of America 
regarding how Libor rates are calculated.

Canada’s Competition Bureau is looking into the activities of Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and others.

At least nine agencies have carried 
out investigations into Libor, including the Financial Services 
Authority in Britain and Japan’s Financial Supervisory Agency.

Authorities across the world are also looking into the activity surrounding similar interest benchmarks such as

Tibor, the Tokyo interbank rate, and Euribor, the eurozone rate.

Bart Chilton, commissioner of the 
CFTC, said: ‘This thing was about smoke, mirrors and sneaky backroom 
dealings with potentially dangerous effects on the world economy.’

He added that it was essential that 
there be ‘a sturdy firewall’ between bank workers involved in setting 
the Libor rate and traders.
