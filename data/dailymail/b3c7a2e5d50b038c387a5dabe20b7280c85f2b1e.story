Oregon shoppers were stunned with the automatic doors of their local supermarket opened and a baby bear strolled down the aisle. 

The cub spent sometime wandering through the streets of Ashland, firstly walking into the Super 8 motel before crossing the road to the  RiteAid supermarket. 

Shoppers filmed the cub - thought to be about one month old - as it strolled through the feminine hygiene section and past the mouth wash.

According to Kobi5.com Ashland Police were able to trap the bear using a shopping basket. 

The bear is currently being cared for by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. 

They said it is unlikely that the bear can be released back into the wild as it has had contact with humans. They are now looking to rehouse it in a zoo or a wildlife reserve. 

According to the ODFW, there are approximately 25,000-30,000 bears living in Oregon's forests. 

Despite their fearsome reputation, bears are omnivores whose primary diet includes nuts, berries, grasses and insects. 

However, they will eat small mammals, amphibians and fish.  

The one-month-old cub showed very little interest to any of the mouth wash products on the shelves 

Unsurprisingly, the bear cub walked straight past the the selection of razors before it was captured
