A mugger knocked down a three-year-old girl in broad daylight just so she could steal her iPad.

The pretty youngster - who has not been named - was waiting for her mother to take her nine-month-old brother out of the family car outside their home in Houston, Texas.

Her mother, who asked for herself and her family not to be named, said she spotted the female thief loitering in the shadows of an alleyway with a man moments before she struck.

Victim: The youngster - who has not been named - was waiting for her mother to take her nine-month-old brother out of the family car outside their home in Houston, Texas

She believes the attack was premeditated and the couple had targeted her family because they knew the young child would be unable to put up a fight.

As the youngster played innocently on the iPad, the crook waited until her mother's back was turned and ran towards the girl, barged her to the ground and snatched the tablet, worth up to $900.

'When I turned around to grab the baby from the car seat, 
she came running towards her, knocked her down and took her iPad,' she told KPRC-TV News.

Premeditated: The girl's mother said she spotted the female thief loitering in the shadows of an alleyway with a man in the moments before the attack

Tough: The girl's mother said she had dealt with the ordeal remarkably well and suffered little more than a little shock

'They came over here and they were waiting for us to come through 
the breezeway I guess so they could take the iPad. So, I guess they 
didn't see me coming right away.'

She added: 'What the Hell? How can anyone do that to a little girl. Get a job.'

Police have launched a manhunt for the thief and her male accomplice and have asked anyone with information that might help snare them to come forward.

The girl's mother said she had dealt with the ordeal remarkably well and suffered little more than a little shock.
