Police divers have recovered the body of a six-year-old boy, two days after he went missing while swimming in the Murray River in northern Victoria.

At 2pm on Monday his body was located by Deniliquin Local Area Command. 

The boy was found 7.5 kilometres north of where he was last seen at a campside on Gunbower Island in Koondrook, Victoria, near the NSW border.

The boy has been formally identified and an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident is underway.

A report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner.

The child had been swimming with six other children when they all started to struggle in the water, drifting downstream. 

Police were called to the scene at around 2.30pm and spent around 48 hours searching for the missing child

Four of the children managed to get themselves out of the water, but the other three began to struggle against the current.

Several adults jumped into the water and managed to rescue two of the children out but were unable to locate the six-year-old boy. 

Police were called to the scene at about 2.30pm on Saturday, after the child could not be found. 

A search – involving NSW Police, Victoria Police, NSW SES, NSW Maritime, NSW Volunteer Rescue Association, NSW Police Divers and a number of civilians – commenced immediately. 

The young boy was found 7.5 kilometres north of the campsite where he was last seen

The young boy was swimming with six other children at a campsite on Gunbower Island is Koondrook, Victoria, when the river's current began pulling them downstream

Gunbower Island is located in the Gunbower National Park, and is a popular tourist destination for fishing, swimming, and boating. 

In 2010, a toddler drowned in the Gunbower Creek after wandering away from the two adults supervising him.

They found him floating in the river and performed CPR on him until an ambulance arrived, but paramedics were not able to revive him.
