'Scrooge': Jane Porter, Headteacher of Whitehill Primary School in Gravesend, has defended her ban on Christmas

A primary school headmistress has forbidden children as young as four from mentioning Christmas, threatening to cut their play time if they break the rule.

Jane Porter has imposed a Christmas ban on all pupils and staff at Whitehill Primary School in Gravesend, Kent until December.

Outraged parents say their children are being punished over something they are too young to understand.

Mrs Porter claims holiday excitement has been taking hold too early and is distracting the pupils at the Kent school.

She says starting Christmas celebrations too early means the true spirit of the event is lost.

However, parents at Whitehill say many of the children, who are aged four and upwards, do not understand why they are not allowed to mention Christmas, and are branding Mrs Porter a 'Scrooge'.

Father-of-three Robert Dalton, 31, an electrician, said: ‘I feel this is wrong and immoral.

‘Kids have Christmas rammed down their throat by TV advertising from as early as September and yet they can be punished for mentioning it at school.

‘If they are caught saying the word Christmas they stand to lose their golden time flexi playtime which is used as a reward for good work and behaviour.’

An anonymous parent added: 'How dare a headteacher threaten children with losing their golden time like this?

'She’s a Scrooge is ever there was one - all the kids are doing is talking about what they would like for Christmas or where they are going to spend the holidays.'

Mrs. Porter said: ‘It has always been the case that Christmas, a Christian festival, starts on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, and that’s December 1 this year.

‘It’s always been the case at our school. It’s been like that since I started here in 1997 and it was like that before then too.

‘I would have to question why people would want it to start any earlier.’

Festivity ban: Children at Whitehill Primary School, who are aged from four and upwards, have been banned from mentioning the word Christmas or anything related to the holiday or face losing 'golden playtime'

She added: ‘One of our rules is to work hard, so if the children are not working hard, talking about Christmas for instance, then they will lose their golden time.

‘That would be the case with anything not related to school - they shouldn’t be talking about David Beckham, for example.

‘If they’re talking about something they shouldn’t be, they’re not working hard.

‘We’re a school, we’re about education, not retail.’

Whitehill Primary was rated ‘good’ this year by Ofsted, which praised teachers and pupils.

The report said: ‘The clear vision of the head teacher has been pivotal in improving the school.

‘Her high aspirations and focused development have been pursued with rigour and resulted in clear improvements in pupils’ progress, behaviour and the quality of teaching.’

Advent, the period of anticipation before Christmas, begins on the fourth Sunday before December 25, which this year is December 1.
