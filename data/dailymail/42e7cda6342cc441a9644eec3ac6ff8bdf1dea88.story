British travellers have to pay the highest airline taxes in the world - forking out up to 25 times as much as the French, according to new.

Just a handful of countries impose a tax like the UK's Air Passenger Duty (APD) and those that do only charge a fraction of what British holidaymakers are forced to pay.

UK holidaymakers pay between £13 and £91 each, per flight, depending on the route, but other European countries pay as little as 90p per flight.

Rip-off: Families can pay up to £91 each, per flight, for long haul journeys, or £13 for short haul trips

Campaign group A Fair Tax on Flying looked at five European countries that levy a comparable tax - Britain, Austria, Italy, France and Germany.

The UK has three levels of APD, £13.00 a person for short haul flights, like those to most European countries, £69 a head mid-haul, which includes Dubai and Israel and £91 each for those going long haul.

Even the most expensive, Germany, starts with £5.99 for short haul, up to £18.70 for mid haul and just £33.66 for long haul.

AUSTRIA: Short haul £5.59 - mid haul £11.97 - long haul - £27.93

FRANCE: Short haul £0.90 - mid haul £3.60 - long haul £3.60

GERMANY: Short haul £5.99 - mid haul £18.70 - long haul - £33.66

ITALY: Short haul £5.99 - mid haul £5.99 - long haul £5.99

UK: Short haul £13.00 - mid haul £69.00 - long haul £91.00

Note: All amounts refer to economy tickets. Exchange rate used was £1 = 1.253 euro

But in contrast Italy, for instance, just charges £5.99 tax on all flights, no matter where they go.

The travel industry and economic groups want the government to lower or abolish the rates to make it fairer for travellers.

They calculate that abolishing the tax completely would increase the numbers flying by so much that the exchequer would not lose out anyway.

Darren Caplan, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: 'These figures illustrate starkly the extent to which passengers from UK airports are paying a premium compared with people flying from other airports across Europe.

Money-spinner: The UK pays the highest airline tax in the world and up to 25 times more than our French counterparts

'It's impossible not to conclude that APD makes the UK less competitive.

'This is adversely impacting our connectivity, making it harder for businesses to access overseas markets, and damaging our all-important tourism sector.'

And Mark Tanzer, CEO of travel agent organisation ABTA, said: 'There is still a huge disparity in the levels of air tax UK passengers are paying compared with our European neighbours.'

A spokesman for A Fair Tax on Flying said: 'We believe APD is making UK goods and services more expensive, discouraging inbound tourists and investment and making the family holiday abroad - and visiting friends and relatives - less affordable.'
