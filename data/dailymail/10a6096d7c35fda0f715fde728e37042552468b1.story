A legal battle has been sparked by plans to auction off the one of Oskar Schindler's original lists for Â£2million.

An original version of the document, which saved some 1,200 European Jews from the Nazi gas chambers, has gone up for sale on the website of a U.S. memorabilia dealer.

But Erika Rosenberg, an heiress of the Schindlers, says the historic document should be in a museum and is trying to block its sale.

Outrage: Erika Rosenberg, an heir of the Schindlers, says the list should be on display in a museum

Quoted in the Daily Mirror, she said: 'Oskar and Emilie died poor and they desired that these documents be displayed in museums.

'It is very sad to to see this list be commercialised for millions of dollars.

'This legal fight is not for money but for social justice.'

Schindler's List, the inspiration for the 1993 film of the same name, was produced by German industrialists Oskar and Emilie Schindler.

They gave jobs in their weapons factories to some 1,200 Jewish workers to save them from Nazi concentration camps.

The website of Gary Zimet, the dealer who has arranged the sale, says the 'exceedingly rare' original copy of the list is 'the only one ever to be on the market'.

The website claims that the list's 'ironclad' provenance stems from its links to the family of Yitzhak Stern, Schindler's Jewish accountant and co-conspirator.

It is one of only four versions of the list known, it is claimed, with two housed in Yad Vashem, the holocaust museum in Jerusalem, Israel, and the only other in the U.S. Holocaust Museum.

'This version of the list (there are seven all told) is the penultimate, being 14 pages in length and listing 801 names, dated April 18, 1945,' the website says.

'A more poignant and historic World War 2 relic cannot be imagined. This is the opportunity of a lifetime to acquire an item of truly incredible magnitude.'

According to the Daily Mirror, a previous auction for the list was suspended in 2010 after a lawsuit was taken out by Ms Rosenberg, 60.

The daughter of Germans who fled to Argentina in 1940, Ms Rosenberg met Emilie Schindler in Buenos Aires in 1990.

When Mrs Schindler died childless in 2001, she chose Ms Rosenberg as one of five heiresses.

Ms Rosenberg had sought to block the sale of the list on copyright grounds.

She lost the legal battle, but now she and her lawyers are investigating the possibility of appealing to an international court.
