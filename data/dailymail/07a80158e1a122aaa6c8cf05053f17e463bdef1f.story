A Canadian pastry chef has come up with the next calorie-laden bakery must-have: the crookie.

The cookie-croissant mix is made by stuffing croissant dough with crushed Double Stuf Oreos and icing sugar, then baking it with half an Oreo placed on top.

The sweet invention, born in the ovens of Toronto's Clafouti Patisserie et Cafe, materialises into a delicious-looking cake, flaky and gooey all at once.

Olivier's decided to attempt integrating Oreos with universally loved croissants

'When you bite in, it's creamy and 
sweet, with the cream wrapping itself in the croissant dough and a 
crunchiness from the Oreo bits,' says Clafouti owner and baker Olivier Jansen-Reynaud according to Thrillist.

Toronto-based publication The Grid TO challenged Jansen-Reynaud to create a new dessert using two classic but different ingredients.

Oreos became French-born Olivier's favorite cookie when he arrived in Canada many years ago, and so he decided to attempt integrating them with universally loved croissants.

It took several tries to get the shape correct so that the oozy Oreo cream stayed within the flaky pastry layers.

And now Canadian customers are ordering the perfected dessert by the half-dozen, and Jansen-Reynaud says the looks forward to ramping up production to keep up with increasing demand.

If they start making them in the USA, the
 crookie poses a viable alternative for office workers who don't have 
half an hour to spend queuing up for a trendy cronut - the famous croissant-donut hybrid.

Manhattan bakery Dominique Ansel invented the cronut - half
 croissant, half donut - in May and now attracts huge queues to form outside its premises, selling out within an hour.

The cronut, which has already received interest from curious pastry chefs in Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Los Angeles, is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian vanilla cream.

Rose-flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer, which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake; finally, crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish.

'A cronut is not as simple as frying up some croissant dough,' said the chef. 'We actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded different than a croissant'.
