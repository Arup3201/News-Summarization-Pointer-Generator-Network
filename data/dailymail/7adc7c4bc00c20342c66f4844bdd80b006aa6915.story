A 44-year-old Ohio woman has been arrested for the murder of her housemate after blood from the victim was discovered in her car.

Roxanne Buck, who rented a basement room from her alleged victim, Michelle Johnson, has been charged with murder and tampering with evidence.

The Burger King worker is accused of repeatedly stabbing and cutting Miss Johnson, 21, in her basement room, and then trying to clear away evidence.

Victim: Michelle Johnson had been stabbed and cut repeatedly

Miss Johnson's body was found on Saturday, a few days after her mother, Dianna, who lived in the upstairs part of the Stow home with her, had last heard from her.

An autopsy showed she had died from sharp-force neck trauma. The murder weapon has not been found.

'It was a pretty violent crime scene,' police chief Louis 
Dirker told Ohio.com. 'It was obvious there was a lot of passion involved. 
Passion is the best way I can put it. It was obviously a lot of 
passion.'

The motive for the killing is not clear, but Buck had recently been asked to leave the property after falling behind on rent.

She allegedly told police she wasn't bothered about being evicted, and had been due to move out in April.

Police believe that after the killing, which is thought to have taken place Friday, Buck went to her job at a Burger King, 19 Action News reported.

When she was first questioned by police, Buck was described as being 'cooperative but evasive'.

Officers later found blood from the victim on books inside Buck's car.

Buck, who has a previous arrest for domestic violence, is being held in jail on $1 million bond.
