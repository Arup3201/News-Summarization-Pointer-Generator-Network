A pickpocket who kept a 'to do' list of crimes to carry out has been spared a jail sentence - after a judge heard she gave birth in custody while awaiting a court appearance.

Pregnant Claire White, 34, and boyfriend Timothy Myers, 41, were caught snatching handbags from shoppers at a supermarket in Hull, Yorkshire.

But after Judge Mark Berry heard that White had given birth to her first child behind bars, after breaching a previous suspended sentence, he decided to let the pair walk free from court as that experience was 'punishment enough'.

Hull Crown Court heard that White had even kept a diary recording information about her thefts - writing herself reminder notes of which bushes she had flung purses and handbags into while running away, so she could go back and find them.

Judge Berry told White: 'It’s been a difficult time with your baby being born in custody.

'If that’s not punishment enough for these offences, I don’t know what is.

White was caught running across a Sainsbury’s supermarket car park last May - when she was six months pregnant - after her partner assaulted a security guard who tried to stop the pair.

The couple were bailed and re-arrested twice before appearing in court on Monday, where White admitted 11 charges of theft.

Nigel Clive, prosecuting, said: 'When police searched their house, they found other items, including shoes from Debenhams, teddy bears from the Early Learning Centre and Boots advantage cards.'

Myers admitted five thefts, an assault and possession of diazepam.

The court heard Myers, 41, was yet to see his new baby and had made progress in kicking his drug habit.

Judge Berry added: 'You haven’t been able to look after your baby in prison and now he is in care.

'If you do not buck your ideas up, that is where he will stay.'

The couple were handed 12-month community orders.

White was given 150 hours of unpaid work, while Myers - who posted a series of bizarre pictures on his Facebook account which show him butchering a deer - has to complete a six-month drug rehabilitation course.
