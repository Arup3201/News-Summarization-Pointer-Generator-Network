Xavi only has one regret in his career - he never got to play with Manchester United legend Paul Scholes.

The Barcelona pass master has called time on his international career with Spain which saw him win the World Cup and two European Championships.

But despite a glittering 16 years at the highest level for club and country, the one black mark for Xavi is he never got to be in a midfield duo with Old Trafford hero Scholes.

'When I think about all I have won with Spain and Barcelona and all they great players I have played with - it is impossible for me to have any regrets,' said Xavi.

'Maybe one small regret is that I never got to play with Paul Scholes - but I was never going to leave Barcelona and he was never going to leave Manchester United.'

The Catalan star also paid tribute to his national team-mates despite their group-stage World Cup exit.

He said: 'I was going to retire after we won the European Championship in 2012 - but I don't look back and think I wished I had.

'Of course Brazil was very disappointing for us - but I am always proud to represent Spain. We stick together as a team even when things do not go well.'
