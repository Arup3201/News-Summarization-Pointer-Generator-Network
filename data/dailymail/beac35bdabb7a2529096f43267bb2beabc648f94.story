This year's Super Bowl at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey was tailgate free meaning there was no wild and beer infused pre-game party in the football stadium's parking lot.

Not only was there no tailgate debauchery and no smells of hamburgers sizzling on the grill, there was also very limited parking space. For all the 83,000 game tickets sold there were only 13,000 parking spaces costing $150 each.

'You will be allowed to have food in 
your car and have drink in your car. And provided you're in the 
boundaries of a single parking space, you'll be able to eat or drink 
right next to your car. However, you're not going to be able to take out
 a lounge chair, you're not going to be able to take out a grill, and 
you're not going to be able to take up more than one parking space. And 
it'll all be watched very carefully.' said CEO of The Super Bowl 
committee Al Kelly prior to the event.

New Jersey State Police provided security for Super Bowl XLVIII between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks and made sure no one broke the tailgating rule

Ever since 9/11, the Department of 
Homeland Security stepped up regulations at sporting events nationwide 
and aimed to limit potentially dangerous crowding outside the stadium , 
reports the International Business Times.

Some feel as though fans were at a 
serious loss. And some fans were vocal on twitter about the lack of 
tailgating to be had and the crowded trains.

'You’re
 losing the smell of smoke in the air, you’re losing the visual power of
 seeing a big piece of meat cooking over an open flame, Bradford 
Thompson, a chef whose tailgate parties prior to Giants games at MetLife
 Stadium have become legendary, told The New York Daily News.

'I think that’s a loss because as a chef, your visual, your smell... 
people start showing up that you don’t know, they come over... ‘What are
 you guys doing?’ They see smoke, they smell something different. So 
there’s an anticipation, sitting in the cold parking lot drinking a 
beer, waiting for the pork to be done or waiting for the steak to come 
off. The anticipation builds,' he continued.

Taxis and car services like Uber weren't even allowed into the stadium's parking lot. Fans were told that they wouldn't be able to walk to the game either, reported The New York Times.

That means roughly 70,000 fans had to find a way to get to the stadium without driving, cabbing,or walking--and they weren't too thrilled.

Tailgating is a tradition for many US sporting events

Even though The New Jersey Turnpike and the I95 were clear of traffic, the railroads were an utter nightmare.

Since
 there were such few spots in the game parking lot, journalists and VIPs
 were shuttled by bus and other attendees took the PATH train to the 
game.

The Fan Express 
bus was a bus that picked up from several locations around the city to 
transport people to the stadium but tickets cost $51.

Denver
 Broncos and Seattle Seahawks Fans were so disgruntled from the crowded 
trek they yelled, 'New Jersey, your Super Bowl sucks,' reported breitbart.com.

David Fleming of ESPN posted a pic on Twitter along with the caption, ' world's Saddest tailgate.

This was probably the Super Bowl with the world's most frustrated fans.

This is the world's saddest tailgate party
