Five pounds doesn't get you a lot these days. Barely a pint of beer, let alone a square meal. But those who parted with a fiver at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night were handsomely rewarded.

For their admission money, they saw a quite brilliant FA Youth Cup semi-final. The academies of Chelsea and Tottenham boast some of the most-gifted teenage players in the country and how they delivered here - 90 minutes of end-to-end football and seven goals.

And on the day Chancellor George Osborne promised the public would soon have a few more spare fivers in their wallets and declared Britain the 'comeback country' in his Budget, Chelsea were the 'comeback kids'.

Trailing by two from the first leg at White Hart Lane, the defending champions were on the ropes when Shayon Harrison extended Tottenham's advantage with a spectacular opener.

But thanks to doubles from Dominic Solanke and Charlie Colkett, plus another from Izzy Brown, Chelsea roared back to recover the deficit, offset Harrison's late reply, and reach a fourth consecutive final. And with talents such as this, they'll be in the black for many years to come.

Manchester City are likely to be their opponents, they lead Leicester City 3-0 from the first leg. But, as was shown here on Wednesday night, that kind of lead can count for little.

Somewhat bizarrely, Chelsea's head of youth development Neil Bath was formally presented with the Youth Cup trophy for last season's triumph by two FA suits in the press room ahead of the match.

It was a very belated coronation, some 10 months after they edged Fulham in a rollercoaster final here. This game definitely had echoes of that memorable occasion.

But while Bath had another addition for the burgeoning academy trophy cabinet, Chelsea's grip on their crown had been loosened by Spurs in the first leg, goals from Josh Onomah and Kazaiah Sterling gave the north London a commanding lead at tie's midway point.

And in the opening stages, the visitors looked the more likely to extend that advantage as long-range sighters from first Onomah and then Harrison forced goalkeeper Bradley Collins into evasive action.

But as they had in the first leg, Chelsea soon began to dominate possession, largely reducing Spurs to a counter-attacking role. Jay Dasilva, the England under 17 international, was fleet-footed down the left, swapping lightning-quick passes with his colleagues and darting beyond Kyle Walker-Peters at every opportunity.

His whipped crosses were causing a headache for Spurs keeper Harry Voss - one in the sixth minute was comically bundled into his own net under pressure from Tammy Abraham, the referee sparing his blushes. And another on the half-hour had to be acrobatically pushed to safety.

But that agility was matched by the impressive Harrison moments later. When Zenon Stylianides hooked a half-cleared corner into the danger zone, the Spurs starlet watched the ball's flight like a hawk before pivoting and volleying it home left footed while falling backwards.

It was a goal that had the Vine-makers reaching for their smartphones, rushing to share the moment on social media. Harrison appreciated his goal's importance in the context of the tie, Spurs now three goals to the good.

But we have learned never to write off any Chelsea team and, as half-time approached, they suddenly snapped out of the malaise and raised their game to another level.

Five before the break, Solanke gave them hope of a comeback when he turned in Brown's accurate delivery from the right-side and the crowd was buzzing when Brown rammed the ball home from close range minutes later.

It will have delighted those charged with nurturing a new generation of English talent to see those two names on the scoresheet. It also continued Solanke's marvellous run of scoring in every round of this season's Youth Cup, eight goals in total.

Spurs were shell-shocked and simply couldn't stem the Blue waves at the start of the second period. Eight became nine when Solanke powered home a header to level the aggregate score on 51 minutes.

And when the excellent Chelsea captain Colkett caught Voss dozing with a smart curling free-kick from 30 yards, they led for the first time after 144 minutes of the tie.

The hosts were rampant though Spurs may have levelled things again when Charlie Owens fired against the post from a low Stylianides cross.

Chelsea knew they would feel more secure with a fifth goal and it duly arrived when Anton Walkes clumsily clipped Aina inside the box. Colkett, who didn't put a foot wrong all night, coolly stroked home the penalty.

But that security was short-lived. With eight minutes to play, Fikayo Tomori was adjudged to have handled on the floor as Harrison tried to weave his way to goal. The Spurs man ultimately found it from 12 yards but they couldn't get another to force extra time.

Incredibly, this was the fourth time these two teams have met at under 18 standard in the past 19 days. Spurs must be well and truly sick of their blue-shirted foes. For Chelsea, yet another final beckons.
