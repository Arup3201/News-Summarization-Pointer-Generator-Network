Michael Gove said schools could be said to parent some pupils simply as they took an interest

Michael Gove yesterday attacked parents who send their children to school hungry, saying it was due to their ‘chaotic’ lives rather than a lack of cash.

The Education Secretary said increasing numbers of children grew up with ‘guesting parents’, fleeting figures such as parents’ boyfriends or girlfriends who offer little stability.

Mr Gove told a Church of England seminar hosted by the Archbishop of Canterbury that schools could be said to parent some pupils simply because they take an interest in them.

He said: ‘When children arrive at school not having eaten breakfast, it’s more often or not because they’ve grown up in chaotic homes rather than the fact that the finite amount of financial resources entering that home is insufficient to ensure that the children are fed.’

He also urged the Church of England to engage more in the Coalition’s academies and free schools programme.

He said: ‘I want the Church to recover the spirit which infused its educational mission in Victorian times and support more new schools to bring educational excellence to the nation’s poorest children.’

Last year Mr Gove said the state should launch an ‘early intervention’ when youngsters are at risk of being so badly damaged by their appalling childhoods.

In October, Mr Gove warned that significant numbers of children arrive at primary school ‘simply incapable of learning’ because of their chaotic home lives.

During a question and answer session at think-tank Politeia, he said the state must launch an ‘early intervention’ when youngsters are at risk of being so badly damaged by their appalling childhoods.

The Department for Education later confirmed this could include taking these youngsters into care if necessary.

Months earlier, during a speech about adoption, Mr Gove said that social workers do everything they can to keep families together, but it was ‘far better’ for them to ‘follow their instincts to intervene and rescue rather than acquiesce in abusive or neglectful parenting in the hope things will improve’.

Meanwhile, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, sparked controversy last summer when he said that thousands of children from ‘dysfunctional’ homes should be taken from their parents and put in boarding schools.
