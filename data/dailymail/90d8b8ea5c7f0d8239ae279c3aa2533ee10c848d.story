A newborn baby was found alive, stuffed into trash bag and thrown in a dumpster, at an apartment complex in Houston, Texas this morning.

Maintenance worker Carlos Michel made the sad discovery around 8:30am when he said he heard what sounded like a cat mewing near the dumpster at The Reserve apartments.

After throwing in a bag of trash, he says the sound got louder so he went to investigate.

Strange noises: Maintenance worker Carlos Michel discovered the baby after hearing what sounded like a cat mewing coming from the dumpster

Sad discovery: The baby was found stuffed in a trash bag among food containers, scraps and school homework

Inside a white trash bag along with food containers, scraps and school homework, Michel found a 7-8 pound baby boy with four inches of its umbilical cord still attached.

Michel and another man took the baby to a nearby car to keep it warm while they waited for police and paramedics to arrive.

The boy was found purple and having a hard time breathing but appears to be doing well now at Memorial Hermann Hospital.

The police have since identified the mother as a 16-year-old who attends South Houston High School.

She is currently under examination at the same hospital where her baby is being cared for. Once released she will be questioned by police, who will then decide whether to bring up charges.

Other residents in the apartment early speculated on who the mother was.

'The maintenance lady said that it's a young girl who is pregnant and hiding it all the time,' resident Shawntal Posey told KHOU.

Adding to the tragedy is the fact that Texas has a special law to help new mothers who can't take care of their children.

The Baby Moses law states that a babies up to 60-days-old can be dropped off without fear of prosecution at any hospital, fire station or ambulance station - as long as the baby is handed off to a person.

The whole incident has scared Michel, who is a grandfather himself.

'It made a big impact,' he told the Houston Chronicle.
