Manny Pacquiao has enticed a 'secret sparring partner' from Floyd Mayweather Jnr's gym to help him prepare for their $300million (£200m) mega-fight, according to his trainer Freddie Roach.

The build-up to the showdown on May 2 has been dominated by tales from sparring sessions after a report that Mayweather dropped one of his dance partners with a body shot last weekend.

And Roach previously claimed that Mayweather's manager Al Haymon was paying fighters not to spar with his Filipino charge.

He now believes he has played his trump card by luring an unnamed boxer from his Las Vegas gym.

'I have a secret sparring partner,' Roach told GMA News. 'He doesn't want to get beat up or something like that because he's leaving Mayweather's camp.

'I'm happy with Manny. Me and Manny are on the same page. We're really happy with each other right now.'

Pacquiao and Mayweather will come face-to-face on Wednesday night in their only press conference before fight week.
