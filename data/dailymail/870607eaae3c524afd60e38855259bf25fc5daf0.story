At first glance, it looks uncannily like a human brain.

However, in fact this could be proof of the volcanoes that once flowed across the Marian surface.

The huge circular area is nearly 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, and is described as a 'circular island' by Nasa.

The huge circular area spotted by Nasa is nearly 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, and is in the Athabasca region of the red planet

The Athabasca Valles is an outflow channel on Mars, cut into its surface by catastrophic flooding.  

The very high spatial resolution images from the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed that all the flood features are draped by lava flows. 

This flow, near Athabasca Valles, could be the youngest lava flow on Mars. 

'It looks like a circular island surrounded by a 'sea' of smooth-looking lava flows,' Nasa said.

The Athabasca region where the unique shape was spotted contains some of the youngest lava flows on Mars. 

'Therefore, it is highly possible that volcanism played a role in creating this feature,' Nasa's experts claim. 

'Perhaps lava has intruded underneath this mound and pushed it up from beneath. 

'It looks as if material is missing from the mound, so it is also possible that there was a significant amount of ice in the mound that was driven out by the heat of the lava. 

There are an array of features like this in the region that continue to puzzle scientists.

'We hope that close inspection of this HiRISE image, and others around it, will provide some clues regarding its formation,' they say.

The Athabasca Valles is an outflow channel on Mars, cut into its surface by catastrophic flooding.  

The very high spatial resolution images from the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed that all the flood features are draped by lava flows.

HiRISE is one of six instruments on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  

The 65 kg (143 lb), $40 million instrument was built under the direction of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.

It consists of a 0.5 m (19.7 in) aperture reflecting telescope, the largest so far of any deep space mission, which allows it to take pictures of Mars with resolutions of 0.3 m/pixel (about 1 foot), resolving objects below a meter across. 

Research published in January 2010, described the discovery of a vast single lava flow, the size of the state of Oregon, that 'was put in place turbulently over the span of several weeks at most.'

This flow, near Athabasca Valles, is the youngest lava flow on Mars. 

It is thought to be of Late Amazonian Age.

The floor of Athabasca Valles is peppered with thousands of small cones and rings formed as steam exploded through the lava flow. 

Because the flood-carved surface is now covered by lava, it is no longer easy to determine the age of the water floods that passed through Athabasca Valles. 

It is plausible that the flood was triggered by rising magma.

Around 80% of the craters in Athabasca Valles are secondary craters from the impact that created Zunil crater.
