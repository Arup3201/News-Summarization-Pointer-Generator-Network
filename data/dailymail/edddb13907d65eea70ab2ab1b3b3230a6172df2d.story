Police are staking out a lay-by after local astronomers claimed it is being used as a dogging site - causing queues of traffic waiting to get ‘a slot’.

They claim dozens of cars are often seen trying to get into a lay-by big 
enough for just three cars, with weekends being the ‘busiest time’.

The complaints from members of the Croydon Astronomical 
Society, which has an observatory just a short walk from the dogging 
site in Kenley, south London, has prompted the police to set up a stake out at the lay-by.

They hope catching the doggers in the act will deter others from visiting the site.

Speaking at a local police meeting this week, PCSO Kelly Evans reassured locals that police were doing all they could to stop the doggers and that she had been up to the site to see if there were ‘any heads popping up from inside cars’.

She said that on average there were between four and 12 cars using the lay-by every night and promised to crack down on doggers, although she said no arrests have yet been made.

One member of the Croydon Astronomical Society, who only wanted to be known as AstroJohn, said: 'The sex sessions are normally in the secluded lay-by area in Waterhouse Lane, just off Hayes Lane in Kenley.

'The police should be aware as we have told them about this in the past.'

Local resident Simon Lawson, 43, said: 'Every time you drive past that lay-by you see cars queuing up to get a slot.

'You can only get three cars in, at a push four, and sometimes the cars queuing up cause quite a problem for other drivers, who just want to get to home.'

He added: 'The police need to go there on a Saturday night and just nick everyone there - it won’t be hard to catch them, they’ll have their pants around their ankles.'

Police said that are investigating the complaints.
