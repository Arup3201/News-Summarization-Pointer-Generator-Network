Republican Senator John McCain labeled Russia as nothing but a 'gas station masquerading as a country' in a television appearance Sunday where he called out president Obama's 'disturbing lack of realism' in dealing with the crisis in Crimea.

Just back from a visit to Ukraine, McCain urged the Obama administration to do more. He called for military assistance to Ukraine, resumption of development of a U.S. missile defense system for Eastern Europe and steps toward NATO membership for Georgia and Moldova.

'The United States of America has to first of all have a fundamental reassessment of our relationship with Vladimir Putin. No more 'reset' button,' McCain told CNN's State of the Union.

Offensive: Senator John McCain appeared on CNN Sunday after a trip Kiev. He blasted Russia as weak and vulnerable and suggested the Obama's worldview has shrunken America's place on the world stage

The senator referred to Obama's focused outreach to Russia early in his first term that has since been abandoned.

'Treat him for what he is,' McCain said, referring to Putin. 'That does not mean re-ignition of the Cold War. But it does mean treating him in the way that we understand an individual who believes in restoring the old Russian empire.'

Much of his argument dealt with Russia's reliance on fossil fuels to drive its economy.

'Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country,' McCain told Candy Crowley. 'It's kleptocracy, it's corruption, it's a nation that's really only dependent upon oil and gas for their economy.'

McCain urged the Obama administration to use that reliance to pressure Russia out of Ukraine using economic sanctions.

He also went a step further to suggest sending in 'some military assistance to Ukrainians.'

Demands: McCain's CNN appearance came just after his return from a trip to Ukraine, where he spoke with fellow senators (at rear is Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois) on Saturday and called for military aid to be sent to the region

'At least so they can defend themselves,' McCain argued. 'Resume the missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Look at Moldova and Georgia, both of whom are occupied by Russian troops as we speak, a path toward membership in NATO.'

While in Kiev over the weekend, McCain urged a group of fellow senators to help get both 'lethal and non-lethal' military equiment to Ukraine, calling it 'the right and decent thing to do.'

As they sat powerless while Crimeans voted to unite with Russia, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said the right thing is exactly what the White House is trying to do.

'We are putting as much pressure on the Russians as we can to do the right thing,' he said Sunday.

Pfeiffer insisted the United States would not recognize the results of the referendum and said the administration was working with European partners to step up pressure on Russia in the worst East-West standoff since the Cold War. Crimea's pro-Russian regional government went ahead with the referendum despite U.S. and European threats against Moscow.

'You can expect sanctions designations in the coming days,' Pfeiffer told NBC's Meet the Press, as the administration prepares to identify Russians whom the United States will seek to punish with visa bans and asset freezes the president authorized last week.

While the United States and its allies essentially have ruled out military action, Pfeiffer sidestepped the question of whether Washington would provide military aid to Ukraine's interim government, which has accused Russia of violating its sovereignty over Crimea.

'We're looking at all ways of assistance,' Pfeiffer said.

White House response: Also on Sunday, senior White House official Dan Pfeiffer appeared on NBC's Meet the Press and said the U.S. intends to apply pressure through sanctions and other means in order to 'do the right thing'
