Cycling, running and swimming in a gruelling triathlon over more than 15 miles, Anthony Connor appeared as fit as a fiddle.

The 39-year-old swam 800 yards before jumping on a bike and riding 12 miles, then running three miles...all in the space of two-and-a-half hours.

Pretty impressive for a man who was claiming disability benefits.

On his toes: Investigators secretly filmed Connor 
swimming, cycling and running (pictured right) for a total of 25km during the Tatton Park
triathlon in Knutsford, Cheshire

A massive stroke, he told welfare 
officials, had left him unable to walk up and down stairs without help, 
or climb into the bath without assistance. As far as walking was 
concerned, he could cover 80 yards, but even that took him five minutes.

Connor’s lies saw him falsely claim 
£17,000 in benefits. But his luck ran out after investigators filmed him
in the 25km Tatton Park triathlon in Knutsford, Cheshire.

Covert footage showed the athlete 
whizzing past spectators on his bike and later raising his arms in 
victory as he completed the run.

Yesterday Connor, from Baguley, 
Manchester, was facing jail after he admitted a charge of failing to 
notify officials of an improvement in his condition.

He will be 
sentenced at a later date.

Magistrates were told he had claimed 
benefits legitimately in 2006 after having  a stroke and had been 
granted disability living allowance, income support, housing benefits 
and council tax benefit.

Harold Smith, prosecuting, said: ‘The
defendant said he had been left with a weakness in his left side and 
couldn’t walk more than 75 metres in five minutes. He said he walked 
with a limp and needed someone with him, seven days a week, to ensure 
his safety.’

But after a tip-off, officials from 
the Department for Work and Pensions began filming Connor and caught up 
with him as he took part in the triathlon in September 2010.

Benefits: As well as disability handouts Connor also claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit

It also emerged he had become  a self-employed floor polisher,  carrying tools and equipment without difficulty.

The court heard the benefit over-payments from June 2010 to July 2011 amounted to £17,000.

Chris Joseph, defending, said Connor 
had entered the triathlon as a ‘challenge to himself’ and was 
‘completely out of action’ for some weeks after. Mr Joseph said the 
recovery process from the stroke was ‘complex’.

‘Some days he felt he could get up 
and work but some days he felt he could be wiped out for days on end,’ 
he said. ‘In that grey area he became reliant on his benefits and took 
it too far.’
