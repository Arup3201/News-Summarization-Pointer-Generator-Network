This horrifying video shows the moment a teenager lost a game of chicken with a 54mph lorry.

Against all odds, the 14-year-old boy escaped with minor injuries after being hit by the 40-tonne truck.

The incident happened in October on the A449 near Penkridge, Staffordshire, and the clip has been released to deter youngsters from playing with their lives during the half term break. 

Cheating death: This teenage boy lost a game of chicken with a 40-tonne truck - but somehow survived

It shows three youngsters on a grass verge next to the broad single carriageway before two boys began running across.

One of the boys easily cleared the path of the truck as it came screeching to a halt, but the other realised seconds before impact that he would be hit.

He appeared to change direction and try outrunning the lorry, a tactic which lasted just a fraction of a second before the HGV smashed into him - still travelling at 45mph.

The boy tumbled forwards into the road, rolling over until he briefly came face to face with the driver.

He then hobbled off without any sign of serious injury. 

The video was filmed by the truck driver's dashboard camera, which showed the exact location and the time of the crash along with the speed of the lorry.

The footage appears to suggest that the HGV driver was exceeding the speed limit, which is 40mph for HGVs on single carriageway main roads.

The limit was due to rise from 40mph to 50mph early this year, the government announced last summer. It is 60mph for cars.

Horror: The incident, caught on the driver's dashboard camera, happened in the middle of the day in October

Frightening: The driver was travelling at 54mph on the A449 near Penkridge, Staffordshire, when it unfolded

Impact: The boy's hood flew into the air as the truck, screeching to a halt, hit him at around 45mph

Concerned that the boy would contact police, the truck driver trumped him by approaching officers and handing in the footage.

Police quickly decided no crime had been committed by the driver, who was described as 'extremely shaken'.

The risk of death increases hugely once cars or trucks are travelling at more than 40mph.

However, the number of pedestrians killed on Britain's roads has fallen almost every year for the past decade.

Some 857 pedestrians were killed on the roads in 2000, a figure which had fallen below 600 by 2007 and fell below 400 for the first time in 2013.

Ranked by the total number of deaths, a car is still the most dangerous place to be on the roads. Some 785 car occupants died in crashes in 2013, compared to 109 cyclists and 331 bikers.

Gone: The boy's legs were whisked out of shot as truck mowed him down

Tumble: The boy rolled over several times in the road before coming to a halt some way in front of the truck

More than half of truckers now have dashboard cameras to help them provide evidence to insurance firms and police.

The footage was released by SmartWitness, which manufactured the camera which filmed the incident.

Sales director Mark Berry said: 'It happened on a rural road with no witnesses. Let's imagine what might have happened if it had not been captured on the camera.

'Obviously it was a huge relief to everyone that this lad was not more badly hurt.

'His escape is frankly remarkable given the size of the truck and the speed it was travelling at the time of the collision. He only had a badly bruised ankle. 

'We have released the footage this week during half-term to show the crazy risk a very small number of youths are taking by playing chicken.

'I don't think anyone viewing the footage would ever contemplate playing chicken again.' 

Survival: For a brief moment, the teenager came face to face with the driver, who handed footage to police

Hobbling: The boy made his escape with no more than a badly bruised ankle, but left the driver shaken

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'We received a call at 1pm on 26 October 2014, reporting a collision involving a HGV and a pedestrian on the A449 at Dunston.

'Officers attended the scene. A 14-year-old boy was taken to Newcross Hospital with minor injuries to his hand and knee.

'The incident was looked into and no further action was taken against any parties.'
