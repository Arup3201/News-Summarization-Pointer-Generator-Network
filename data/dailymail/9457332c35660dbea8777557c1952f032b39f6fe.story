Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos has revealed that the penalty given against him in the defeat by Atletico Madrid further emphasised why he prefers the Premier League ahead of La Liga.

The league leaders lost for the second match in a row against their near rivals in the first leg of their last-16 Copa del Rey clash on Wednesday, with the Spain international adjudged to have fouled Raul Garcia for the spot kick that gave Atletico the all-important lead. 

After the game the 28-year-old underlined his frustration at the award of the penalty, indicating such a decision wouldn't have been made in the English game.

The 28-year-old can't believe what is seeing after being penalised for a foul on Atletico Madrid's Raul Garcia

He told AS: 'I'm not going to talk about controversial issues and certainly not that incident.

'The only thing I will say is that, with every passing day, I prefer the English Premier League.

'What am I talking about? Obviously not about the ball-boys... the style of play, refereeing. 

'People enjoy watching that competition. When one loses, it's easy to focus on the refereeing decisions.'

Madrid now face a uphill battle to maintain their chance of retaining their Copa del Rey trophy, but Ramos insists that his team will fight to the bitter end.

He added: 'Real Madrid as an institution obliges us to do our best to try and overcome this tie.

'Our focus is initially on Saturday's game against Espanyol and then on the return leg.'
