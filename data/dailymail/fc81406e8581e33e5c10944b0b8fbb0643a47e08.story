A new Home Office report says a rise in heroin use in the early 1990s could have been behind a huge spike in thefts and other crimes

A fall in the number of drug addicts using heroin and crack cocaine could have led to a 60 per cent drop in crime in the last 20 years, according to a new report.

Home Office research claims an 'epidemic' in class A drug use in the late 1980s and early 1990s - made famous in the book and film Trainspotting - was a huge driver in the rise in acquisitive crime.

But the new report suggests the current generation of young people have turned their backs on the drugs, leading to a large drop in crimes linked to the substances.

Experts have previously disagreed over what has caused the recent fall in levels of thefts and burglaries.

Some academics have suggested higher conviction rates are behind the drop, others say greater security technology could be the cause, while others even suggested reduced amounts of lead in petrol are making people less aggressive.

The new government paper, written by researcher Nick Morgan, suggests levels of heroin and crack use are key to understanding the rise and fall.

He states: 'The number of heroin users increased markedly through the 1980s and early 1990s and many also used crack as their drug-using career developed.

'This "epidemic" spread from area to area but the national peak probably occurred between 1993 and 2000. Crime peaked between 1993 and 1995.'

He added: 'Evidence suggests that, for at least some users, heroin/crack was the catalyst for offending, and for others it probably accelerated and extended their criminal career.'

Statistics reveal that 13 police forces saw the number of burglaries peak in 1992/1993, with a further 19 forces seeing the offence peak the following year.

After rising by more than 70 per cent between 1989 and 1994, the offence has generally fallen in the years since.

The study highlighted Merseyside and Edinburgh, where Irvine Welsh's book Trainspotting is set, as areas which appeared to show a correlation between the use of hard drugs and the rise in crime.

Trainspotting was made into a film in 1996 and followed a group of heroin addicts in the late 1980s in Edinburgh and their life beyond.

The report continues: 'The starkest example of regional variation was Merseyside, which had a recorded acquisitive crime peak five years before other police force areas.

'Evidence also suggests that Merseyside was one of the first areas to be hit by the heroin epidemic and the first to mount a concerted treatment response.'

Mr Morgan suggests that tackling the use of the hard drugs could be seen as key to addressing crime problems in the future.

He wrote: 'Evidence also suggests that, for volume-crime reduction, it is crucial to maintain a focus on heroin/crack, despite the higher prevalence of other illicit drugs like cannabis, powder cocaine and ecstasy, and the emergence of new psychoactive substances.

'Specifically, it remains important to identify the minority of heroin/crack users who commit large volumes of crime during addiction periods.

'If that can be done, and those periods of addiction and offending can be shortened or prevented, the potential for further reductions in crime remains significant.'
