An astonishing collection of 30 unique doll houses from around the world are being put up for auction by the 89-year-old pensioner who has spent her life collecting them.

Nora Boll was just two-years-old when her mother bought her first dolls house in 1925.

Since then, Mrs Boll has spent her life building on her collection and filling her houses with pieces from all over the world.

Life-long passion: Pensioner Nora Boll has spent her life collecting the miniature homes after her mother bought her a dolls house in 1925 when she was just two-years-old

For sale: Nora Bell's collection - which includes furniture pieces from around the world - will be sold at auction

Her collection totals around 30 doll houses filled with everything from tiny chandeliers and silk curtains made from parachutes, to minute toilet rolls and even a toilet brush.

Mrs Boll picked up the unique miniature furniture items from various countries including Japan, Switzerland and Yugoslavia, as well as from fairs, junk shops and gypsy markets while on her holidays.

She also picked up pieces from auctions and fairs, including Swiss Lundy furniture, which kitted out an entire house.

Now the unique collection of houses will go under the hammer at the Newcastle salerooms of Anderson & Garland, though it is so large that it will be split across two separate auctions, the first of which is being held tomorrow while the second will be a fortnight later.

The sale will also include hundreds of pieces of furniture.

Mrs Bell's mother bought her first second-hand dolls house with furniture in 1925 when Nora was just two and they lived in Elswick, Newcastle.

This was joiner-made and made around 1910 - meaning it has survived two world wars.

Over time the collection grew and they would buy from different shops, including a toy shop in Newcastle called Alfreds, where they would pick up furniture.

The hobby stopped however when Mrs Bell's mother died at the beginning of World War II and everything in the house was split up.

Fortunately, Mrs Boll's brother kept on to the house and a box of furniture to be passed on to Mrs Bell after the war and she picked up the hobby again after retiring as a physiotherapist.

One of her favourite purchases was the house made up entirely with Swiss Lundy furniture which has three tiers to it - each one has a different type of painted furniture on it.

She also loved the largest house which was bought at Featonby's and can be accessed from the front and back.

The furniture from that particular house was made around the 1940s with the curtains made up of parachute material.

Mrs Boll would love the dolls houses to either go to a museum or someone who will cherish them like she has.

She couldn't ever afford to buy a lot in one go and so she painstakingly collected piece by piece over time and looked after them with love and care.

John Anderson, of Anderson & Garland, said dolls houses are still popular collectors items today.

He added: 'There is something of a cult hobby based on dolls' houses and furniture.

'Modern dolls' houses are to the same scale and there are small specialist makers turning out items such as chandeliers and grandfather clocks. It is a cottage industry.

'It appeals to people who can't furnish a Grand Designs dream home but they can do it in miniature.

'But the dolls' houses in this collection are to different scales.

'Some items of dolls' house furniture can be expensive and it has happened that we have sold some which has fetched a higher price than the real life-size equivalent items.'

Alex Kingsley, PR consultant for Anderson & Garland, added: 'There has been a lot of interest already.

'It is such a unique collection. It includes stuff from Japan, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. It's quite an interesting collection.

'I've never seen one so big and to come from an old house in Heaton it's quite bizarre.

'It can be collectors who are interested in this sort of thing. A lot of people collect dolls houses and have quite big collections.

'A lot of the time people have collected them when they were young and are still interested when they are retired.

'Also a lot of the time people buy them who want to live in a dream house themselves but can't afford it.

'Those people will often buy expensive things for dolls houses, like a crystal chandelier because they can't afford a real one, people enjoy that.

'I think they will go for quite a lot. Some of the things are really rare and so old they should go for quite a bit.

'It is nice for the old lady who they belonged to.'
