It is the country which idolises beauty queens and adores plastic surgery - but whose hard-left government's policies have left it struggling with shortages of everything women want to stay beautiful.

Venezuela's famed models and
aspiring beauty queens are struggling to doll themselves up as
shortages turn eye shadow and breast implants into coveted
luxuries.

Even basics like deodorant are now at times
tricky to find as strict currency controls have led to a
scarcity of dollars for imported goods.

A shortage of beauty products and cosmetic surgery supplies - including breast implants - has hit Venezeula. The country is said to have one of the largest number of people to have undergone cosmetic operations such as breast augmentation, who include Georgina Osuna, a student, 23, who was treated by Dr Jonathan Veliz

Even stilletos are in short supply in Venezuela. In a Caracas modelling academy, some are reduced to taping themselves into shoes that are too large for them. The academies train girls as young as three in a country where being a beauty queen is revered

Students at a Caracas modelling academy are learning to model without all the make-up and shoes they need. Currency controls are causing shortages of goods of all kind in the country, from toilet roll to razors

Determined models and pageant competitors are doing their
utmost to keep the show on the road.

'I exhaust myself visiting pharmacies, I look everywhere for
makeup,' said Ileanne Davila, a 19-year-old civil engineering
student and model.

'Once I couldn't find red eye shadow... so I used lipstick,' she said as she took a break from a photo shoot. 'I can't find
powder for my skin color. So sometimes I mix two hues.'

Her long dark hair straightened and her lips and eyes
covered in black makeup for a rock'n'roll-inspired shoot,
Davila said she aspires to break into commercials or television
because, she explained with a sigh, she is not tall enough to
compete in Miss Venezuela.

Davila is one of dozens of girls aged three and up who attend a 
modeling academy run by Gisselle Reyes, a former Miss Venezuela
candidate who now prepares girls for the pageant, to learn how
to strut down a runway and perfect pageant etiquette in the
hopes of one day being crowned queen.

But even at this glamorous holdout in Caracas' affluent
Altamira area, shortages are crimping plans to follow in Reyes'
footsteps - sometimes quite literally.

Young girls don their mothers' heels because they can't find
stilettos their size. Teachers usually make them work the runway
barefoot - or strap them into their mothers' oversized shoes
with scotch tape.

Girls share makeup and look up YouTube videos on how to make
deodorant at home. Even when they can find the beauty products
they want, some are unable to pay for them as scarcity drives up
prices.

Davila estimates the price of a good face powder, for
instance, has increased 500 percent in the last 18 months.

Modelling is a career of choice in Venezuela with the country producing more Miss Universes than anywhere except the United States. But even competitors for Miss Venezuela are struggling to get basic supplies

Even aspiring Miss Venezuelas are having trouble getting
their hands on makeup ahead of the pageant next month, said an
instructor who, like the candidates, is barred from speaking to
the press in the run-up to the event.

The quest for beauty is one of the rare pastimes that unites
this polarized oil-rich nation.

The country boasts seven Miss Universes, a record only
topped by the United States. Venezuela is thought to have one of
the highest rates of breast implants in the world, and plastic
surgeries are sometimes given away as raffle prizes.

Venezuela's government says parts of the capital and seven western states were left without electricity after two generating plants had technical problems.

The blackout began at 1.30 pm on Thursday in Caracas and lasted about an hour. It caused traffic jams in parts of the capital as street lights stopped working and office buildings were evacuated, causing hundreds of people to walk in the middle of streets because sidewalks were overflowing.

Electrical energy minister Jesse Chacon said frequency fluctuations caused problems in "two large generating machines" in the Andean region. He said seven of Venezuela's 23 states were affected.

The socialist country suffered major blackouts in 2012 and 2013. The administration blamed those outages on sabotage, while opponents said they were the result of government incompetence.

But now, doctors say beloved Botox and breast implants can
be hard to come by.

When Maria Eugenia Espinoza decided to replace her
eight-year old implants, equivalent to bra size 36, she was told
only implants equivalent to size 42 and up were available.

'Imagine!' said the 46 year-old mother of two. 'I would have
looked like one of those dancing girls!'

After searching for five months, Espinoza found implants in
the nick of time for her scheduled operation. 

Critics have long said Venezuela's cult of beauty
objectifies women and promotes shallow values. And Osmel Sousa,
the president of the Miss Venezuela pageant, gave them more
ammunition when he said last year that ugly women invented the
concept of inner beauty to feel better about themselves.

The shortages of beauty products can seem frivolous when
compared with the scarcity of medicines and basic goods from
flour to diapers.

Venezuela's scarcity index hit a record 28 percent in
January, indicating that 28 of 100 basic consumer goods were
scarce. The central bank hasn't given data on shortages since.

Currency controls first enacted by former socialist
president Hugo Chavez more than a decade ago mean companies
struggle to get hold of the hard currency required for imports.

Chavez's hand-picked successor, President Nicolas Maduro, 
blames the shortages on rapacious smugglers who scoop up
price-controlled goods, including shampoo, to resell them on the
local black market or even in neighboring Colombia.

Some government supporters scoff that a pampered elite is
overstating the magnitude of shortages to try to weaken the
president.

Venezuela is grappling with 60 percent annual inflation and
sky-high crime rates, and is widely believed to be in recession.

Maduro says the country's problems are the result of an
"economic war" waged against him by Venezuelan business leaders
and foreign companies.

But, paradoxically, some say the hardships are actually
pushing some Venezuelans to dedicate even more time to their
appearance.

'Venezuelans ... might not have enough money to eat, but
they'll have enough money to be beautiful,' said Miguel Torres,
who runs a beauty parlor and used to work for Miss Venezuela.

Jeweller George Wittels designs the crowns for many Venezuelan beauty pageants. But the women taking part struggle without access to basic make-up. The cost of face powder has soared 500 per cent in just 18 months

Not only women are affected by the lack of beauty products. Daniel Eduardo, a barber in Caracas spends his days off in search of wax - and uses gelatin when it has run out  

Greisy Palacios, a 30 year-old receptionist, spends hours in
lines for everything from soap to nail polish remover and says 
she would only leave her house without makeup if she were
depressed.

'If you're not made up, don't go out,' she said as she got
her nails done. But Palacios is finding it ever harder to abide
by that mantra.

Recently, for instance, friends alerted her that razors had
arrived at a nearby pharmacy. Palacios dashed out of the office.

'But the lines are like a kilometer long, just for razors!' she said. 'I'm going crazy waiting for the country to change. I
regret voting for Maduro.'

The industry that caters to image-conscious Venezuelans is
also feeling the pinch.

In a Caracas salon, beautician Janeth Canaveral points to a
small table covered with a dozen pots of creams and wax: 'That's what I have left.'

At this rate, Canaveral, a single mother of three, said she
will be forced to shut down her business within a year. 'How do
I start again at age 50?'

 

Shortages are a fact of every day life in Venezuela, with shoppers having to rush when items become available

Imported products are more expensive and scarcer because of currency controls which stop dollars being brought into the country 

Barber Daniel Eduardo said he spends Mondays - his day off
- hunting down products. 

'If I don't have wax I go out to walk
and look for some,' he said, speaking above pulsating music in a
buzzing salon in Caracas' Catia slum.

'And if there's no wax, well, I use gelatin,' he shrugged. 'You have to be a magician here.'

Bigger companies are often better able to cope with red tape
and expensive imports.

Nidal Nouaihed, a designer who has dressed the current Miss
Venezuela, hired five people to help him import fabrics like
silk and chiffon. Costs have skyrocketed, but he says his
high-end business is still booming.

'During times of crisis, there's a lot of anxiety and people
want more luxury, want to be more glamorous, they want to
forget,' said Nouaihed. 'We create a parallel world.'
