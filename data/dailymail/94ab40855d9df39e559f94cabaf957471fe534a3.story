This is the moment residents and pets had to be rescued from their homes in a inflatable raft after their street flooded with thousands of litres of water due to a burst water main. 

More than 20 properties were evacuated when the underground pipe suddenly ruptured in Kingswood, Bristol, at around 5pm yesterday.

The water filled Fisher Road and was knee-deep in 15 houses, with 17 people and six dogs having to be rescued.

The water supply was also affected for homes in surrounding areas, including Pucklechurch, Mangotsfield, Oldland Common and Whitchurch.

A spokesman for Avon Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Firefighters in dry suits assisted in the rescue of 17 people from their homes, some of whom were helped to safety using an inflatable rescue raft. 

'Six dogs were also removed from homes by the crews.

'The British Red Cross provided support to those displaced by the incident at a nearby church hall.

'Staff from Bristol Water worked to isolate the water leak; however, due to concerns that the leak may have caused damage to an underground gas main.

'The decision was taken to evacuate around half a dozen homes in a near by cul-de-sac as a precaution.'

At 9.30pm, gas engineers confirmed that the gas main had not been affected and fire crews were able to leave the incident in the hands of the local authority and water board, he said.

A spokeswoman for Bristol Water said bowsers had been put in position in five locations, with customers advised to bring their own containers to collect water.

She said: 'We are sorry that this emergency is causing disruption and inconvenience to customers and assure you that we are working hard to reinstate water supplies back to normal as soon as we can make the necessary repairs to our burst main.'
