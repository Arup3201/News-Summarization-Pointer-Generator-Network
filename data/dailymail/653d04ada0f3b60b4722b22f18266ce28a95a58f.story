It's a menu that is enough to make even the most jaded of diners sit up and take notice.

Featuring such delicacies as poached veal's tongue, honey roast locusts, 'dragon' eggs and flaming suckling pig, this is the 15-course banquet inspired by Game of Thrones

These exotic dishes will be making an appearance from Friday 13 February to Sunday 15 February  at London's latest pop-up restaurant,  All Men Must Dine, in the Andaz Hotel in London's Liverpool Street.

All Men Must Dine is a pop-up inspired by season four of Game of Thrones. The dining hall at Andaz Hotel in London's Liverpool Street has been transformed to resemble a medieval banquet room 

The Murder of King Joffrey: Spiced pigeon, dried fruit and almond pie is one of the dishes on the menu 

Pop-up experts The Wandering Chef,  the chefs behind popular temporary bar and restaurant The Little Yellow Door, created the one-of-a-kind epic banquet.

Along with poached veal tongue, the menu includes spiced pigeon, dried fruit and almond pie, and a salad of flowers with dandelion, nasturtium, mustard flowers, pickled walnuts and pear.

Other dishes include the burning pyre - flaming suckling pig stuffed with black pudding, apple, rye bread and sage and served with black pudding ash and a warm salad of pickled baby vegetables, sour apple and watercress.

For pudding guests can tuck into The Battlefield, a bread pudding wall made with bone marrow crème brulee, French meringue, citrus snow and cherry sauce.

Diners will also get to enjoy specially created cocktails, including the Song of Fire and Ice and Dornish wine.

Jamie Hazel, chef and co-founder of caterers The Wandering Chef, said: 'We wanted to to celebrate sort of all of the excess and debauchery of the 'Game of Thrones' world.

'The idea was to recreate a meeting of the Small Council at King's Landing, so we've tried to bring in all the sort of ideas of excess and luxury, a sort of insight into how the rich and privileged in Westeros behaved behind closed doors.'
