A host of celebrities have revealed their most intimate childhood memories of Disney as part of a campaign to raise £1million for charity.

The Great Ormond Street Hospital's Million Disney Memories drive, launched today, is encouraging people to 'donate' their earliest recollections on the kids' movie franchise.

When they reach one million memories, Disney will donate £1million for the charity.

Looking back: Sir Michael Caine talks about his early memories of Bambi as part of the Million Disney Memories campaign

Several stars say Bambi left them in floods of tears when they were children.

Sir Michael Caine said: 'My memories were Snow White and Bambi in those days, I remember crying my eyes out when Bambi’s mother died in the forest and laughing my head off at the Seven Dwarfs.

'I grew up with cartoons. My favourite Disney villain would have to be the wicked witch from Snow White, I think she is great and my favourite Disney hero is Mickey Mouse, he was my first hero and my favourite.'

Cold Feet star Fay Ripley also said one of her first Disney memories was of Bambi.

Sharing is caring: Edith Bowman has shared her first Disney memory which will help to raise money for Great Ormond Street

'I went to see Bambi and I ran into that cinema full of the joys of life and I ran out of it sobbing.'

Will Mellor remembers 'crying my eyes out as a kid' during the movie.

'It was a really sad film. My kids haven’t watched it yet, but I’m going to introduce them to it, to share my tears.'

Alesha Dixon was more optimistic.

'It was the most beautiful experience and highly emotional,' she said.

'Disney literally transported me to another world that I didn't want to end.'

Gavin and Stacey actress Joanna Page was more scared while watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

'I was quite traumatised and I cried a lot,' she said.

'I
remember thinking it was so awful for poor Snow White and I felt so 
terrible about all the dwarfs and it really, really upset me.

'Then
my parents got me a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs book and put my 
name in it as if I was their friend and I remember being very frightened
by that, thinking that I was involved in the story – although I think 
I’d quite like that now.'

Dear deer: Cold Feet star Fay Ripley said her first Disney memory was of Bambi

Harry Potter villain Jason Isaacs revealed he has music from The Jungle Book on his iPod that he still sings along to with his children.

Mel C said she had a foam Mickey Mouse toy that she used to bite chunks out of.

Lewis Hamilton said his mum has a photo of him in infant school in which he is wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt which had buttons on it you could press which made the ears squeak.

He added that he met the character during a trip to Disneyland in Los Angeles.

Extras' Ashley Jensen said her first Disney memory was of Bedknobs and Broomsticks 'because there was a flying bed and then I used to get a little bit scared that there were elves under my bed'.

And I'd Do Anything winner Jodie Prenger said she would always remember the first time she 'met' Snow White.

'I Can still remember what I wore to this day and I kind of hugged her so much that I didn’t want to let go.'

Jungle fever: Angela Griffin remembers The Jungle book for the campaign

Other celebrities involved in the 
campaign include Thandie Newton, Patsy Kensit, Julie Walters, Sophie Ellis Bexter, Emma Bunton, Billy 
Connolly, Edith Bowman, Angela Griffin and Dermot O'Leary.

The campaign was created following research which found that 92 per cent of UK parents and grandparents believe memories of Disney characters stay with you for life.

More than half of the British public have shared their own Disney memories with their family.

The campaign builds on Disney's longstanding partnership with the charity, raising money for the hospital redevelopment and new clinical building, aiming to raise £10million in total.

People can donate their memories by logging into their Facebook account and visiting www.facebook.com/disneyjunioruk or searching for Disney Junior (UK).

If they don't have a Facebook account, they can ask a friend to post their memory.
