American citizens must pay their fair share of tax, the US ambassador to London warned today as Boris Johnson refuses to hand over more than £100,000.

The American-born Mayor of London has said it is outrageous that the taxman in the US is chasing him for unpaid bill worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Matthew Barzun, the White House's man in London, today defended the rules, insisting people who enjoy the benefits of being a US citizen must 'pay your fair share in taxes'.

But he also leapt to the defence of US firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon, insisting they were doing nothing wrong by avoiding pay tax in the UK but were just 'playing by the rules'.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who spent today playing in Ealing, has branded US tax laws 'outrageous'

Mr Johns was born in New York and has both and British and an American passport

Mr Johnson was born in New York and has an American passport as well as a British one.

The law means that American citizens must pay income tax to US authorities if they earn more than £62,000.

The can also be taxed on capital gains on selling a main house made anywhere in the world.

Rejecting the demands, Mr Johnson said: 'I think it's outrageous! No is the answer. Why should I?'

But today Mr Barzun insisted that all Americans must pay their share, wherever they live.

Speaking to a press gallery event in Parliament, he told journalists that he would not discuss Mr Johnson's tax affairs.

He said: 'If you are an American citizen we have the Privacy Act where we as government officials don't talk about you or your tax or health or your other information without your express consent.

'I won't comment on a specific American citizen and their status because of that.'

America wants Britain to stay in the European Union, Matthew Barzun said today.

The US ambassador to London stressed the importance of the UK's membership of theEU days after David Cameron signalled he would be prepared to lead the country out of the 28-member bloc unless there are major reforms.

Mr Barzun said Britain's membership of the EU was a 'really good thing' from an American point of view and US leaders 'really value a strong United Kingdom in a strong EU' because the nations see 'eye to eye' on a range of crucial international issues.

The Prime Minister has vowed to renegotiate the UK's relationship with Europe ahead of an in/out referendum by the end of 2017 if he is returned to Downing Street after the general election.

In a landmark speech less than a fortnight ago setting out plans to tighten welfare rules for EU migrants, Mr Cameron warned that he will 'rule nothing out' if other countries turn a deaf ear to British concerns.

At a Westminster lunch, Mr Barzun was asked whether a British exit would reduce the importance of the UK's special relationship with the US.

Mr Barzun said: 'If you ask us, we really value a strong United Kingdom in a strong EU because we see eye to eye ... on the important issues of the challenges we face - look at Isil, Ebola, climate change, Russian aggression - Europe and the UK are the first places we turn to deal with that.

'That's on the negative side. On the positive side, look at the transatlantic trade deal.

'We see eye to eye. So from a selfish point of view it's a really good thing.

'From a selfish point of you, it's a really good thing but it's entirely up to you folks to figure out your relationship with and within Europe.' 

But he made clear that any US citizen had to pay the tax that is due. He added: 'Look, I mean we have our rules and we expect people to play by them.

'And if you get the benefits of being an American citizen you pay your fair share in taxes.'

However, he defended US companies who have been accused of using international law and cross-borders deals to avoid tax bills in Britain.

Asked if US companies Amazon, Google and Facebook are 'international tax dodgers', Mr Barzun replied sharply: 'No.'

He went on to insist that the tax rules are set by national governments which they then apply legally.

'I'm not the spokesman for any of those great American companies.

'These companies and other companies who do work are clever about using international, the rules that exist, as written by the way by all of us: that's US government British government, we make these rules and they are playing by them.

'And I hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well.'

Last month, on a visit to New York, Mr Johnson revealed that he was refusing to pay a tax bill on the sale of his house in London.

In an NPR interview designed to promote his new book, he said he was subject to Uncle Sam's 'global taxation' policy.

He claimed he was facing a bill on the profits made from selling his first home in London, which is exempt from tax in the UK, but would be taxed in the US.

It is thought he made around £720,000 on the sale. The relevant tax for 2009 sales was 15 per cent, which would give him a total bill of almost £110,000.

Mr Johnson said: 'The great United States of America does have some pretty tough rules, you know.

'You may not believe this but if you're an American citizen, America exercises this incredible doctrine of global taxation...'

'Even though tax rates in the UK are far higher and I'm Mayor of London - I pay all my tax in the UK and so I pay a much higher proportion of my income in tax than I would if I lived in America - the United States comes after me...'

'Would you believe it? For capital gains tax on the sale of your first residence, which is not taxable in Britain, but they're trying to hit me with some bill. Can you believe it?'

Today he took part in the netball match at Ealing, Hammersmith & West London College

Earlier he had a coffee with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for a walkabout with local officers in Ealing town centre

When asked whether he would pay up anyway, Johnson replied: 'I think it's outrageous! No is the answer. Why should I?

'I haven't lived in the United States for, you know, well, since I was five years old. I could [afford the bill] - but I pay the lion's share of my tax. I pay my taxes to the full in the United Kingdom where I live and work.'

The IRS rules state: 'If you are a US citizen or resident alien, the rules for filing income, estate, and gift tax returns and paying estimated tax are generally the same whether you are in the United States or abroad.

'Your worldwide income is subject to US income tax, regardless of where you reside.'

However, Mr Johnson has made his own demands for the US Embassy in London to pay the congestion charge.

Latest figures suggest Mr Barzun's embassy owes more than £8million for driving officials and dignitaries around London.

But Mr Barzun made clear he will continue to refuse to pay up, citing rules which allow embassies to avoid paying tax which would affect business operating in host countries.
