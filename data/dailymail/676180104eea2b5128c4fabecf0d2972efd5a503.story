Dejan Lovren has revealed he rejected a number of highly lucrative deals in order to seal a move to Liverpool.

Lovren, who impressed for the Reds against his former side on Sunday afternoon, sealed a £20million move to Liverpool at the end of July.

The Croatian international has revealed he received a number of lucrative offers to leave St Mary's but had his heart set on a move to Brendan Rodgers' side.

Lovren said on his move to last season's Premier League runners-up: 'I had better offers financially but from the first day I said I want to come to Liverpool.

'I want to achieve something here because I know this club is big and Brendan Rodgers is a great manager.

'There is a lot of talent here - amazing players - and last season they showed they can do something. I'm really confident in this team.'

The 25-year-old's competitive debut went to plan as Liverpool sealed a 2-1 win over the side who brought him to the Premier League in June 2013.

Lovren's new team-mates Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge netted either side of Nathaniel Clyne's second-half strike.
