Kevin Davies can see similarities between Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and his old Bolton boss, Sam Allardyce.

Van Gaal reacted angrily to Allardyce’s comments last weekend that United went route one against West Ham  but Davies thinks the two managers have more in common than they’d like to think.

‘Neither of them will leave any stone unturned,’ said Davies.

Van Gaal reacted angrily to the long ball jibe and set out to prove Allardyce wrong in a press conference

‘When we had team photos at Bolton, there were more staff than players. If Sam dropped a player, he’d slap a load of stats down to justify the decision; distance covered, speed, recovery.

'Every 10 weeks, everyone would be evaluated, how much you were doing in training and matches and where you had to improve.

‘I think Van Gaal is that kind of person as well, in the way he studies games. How many managers would take off a goalkeeper at the end of a World Cup game because the substitute had better stats saving penalties?’
