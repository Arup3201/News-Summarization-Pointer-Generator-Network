Who knows what David and Samantha Cameron were chatting about as they relaxed on their recent break in Ibiza?

But, if former No 10 spin doctor Andy Coulson is to be believed, they should have been discussing the key role she could play in helping her husband win the next election.

Mr Coulson claims Samantha is ‘badly needed in the trenches’ to save Mr Cameron’s premiership.

Holiday: Samantha and David Cameron are on a half-term break in Ibiza this week but former adviser Andy Coulson urged Mrs Cameron to join the battle now for Tory victory in 2015

In a damning critique of Tory 
prospects, he said the Prime Minister’s wife should make more public 
appearances to boost his ‘slim’ chances of winning a majority in 2015.

And he called on her to join ‘small select strategy meetings’ because 
she is one of the few people around Mr Cameron who gives him good 
advice.

The Prime Minister may not want to 
hear from his former communications director who resigned in January 
2011 and is now facing trial over allegations related to phone-hacking.

But Mr Coulson used an article for GQ magazine to deliver a withering 
assessment of Downing Street’s performance.

He said Mrs Cameron is needed now to 
boost the Premier’s appeal to women and prove to voters that the couple 
are committed to staying in No 10.

He writes: ‘The time has now come for
Sam to play a more public role and take some risks.

‘She only joined the 2010 campaign 
once it formally kicked off. She should now be persuaded that the 2015 
campaign is already underway and she’s badly needed in the trenches.

Causes: Since moving into Number 10 Mrs Cameron's media appearances have often been linked to charity work, including this visit with Save The Children to a refugee settlement in Lebanon, close to the Syria border in March

Fun: The PM's wife donned a bright red wig in the run-up to Comic Relief's Red Nose Day as she baked cakes in her Downing Street kitchen

Forces: She has also been heavily involved in promoting the Tickets For Troops project to secure entry to major events for military personnel

‘Sam might also take a more active 
part behind the scenes. She is one of the few people able to see 
straight to the heart of a matter and offer a clear, sensible view.

There are few people in No 10 with a better eye and she could play a key
role in the winning back of female voters.’

Mr Coulson says the Conservatives have
a ‘real chance’ of being the largest party after the next election but 
predicts a hung parliament rather than a Tory majority, with the Lib 
Dems ‘likely to hold on to the balance of power’.

He repeats rumours swirling in 
Westminster that No 10 is considering ditching live election TV debates 
in the run-up to the poll.

But he says Downing Street should make clear 
now that the debates ‘are very much on’ and should press for a town 
hall-style debate with questions from the public rather than 
journalists.

Mr Coulson is damning in his criticism
of the way Mr Cameron has run his government over the past two years.

Echoing the concerns of many Tories that the Premier’s inner circle is 
out of touch, Mr Coulson warned that the public are ‘dangerously 
disconnected’ from politicians.

‘Westminster has never been more 
detached from the real world and... he and his office must take 
responsibility and use the next two years to stop the rot,’ Mr Coulson 
writes.

He says the Prime Minister delivers ‘turbo charged oratory’ but ‘only when his back is against the wall’.

Mr Coulson criticises Mr  Cameron for 
failing to keep his MPs on-side and advises: ‘David should be better at
recognising and supporting the talent he has throughout the party 
including the lower ranks.’

He also calls for the return of the ‘currently under-employed’ Liam Fox, who resigned as defence secretary two years ago.

Popular: In the United States First Lady Michelle Obama has remained much more popular than husband Barack, something Mrs Cameron could replicate here

Tips: Andy Coulson urged his old boss David Cameron to listen to his wife's advice more and rely less on civil servants

The former spin doctor is critical of 
Mr Cameron’s reliance on senior civil servants, dismissing Cabinet 
Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood as ‘Sir Jeremy Who-Wood’.

And in an implied criticism of his 
successors, Mr Coulson says Tory high command need to be better at 
getting their message across.

He concludes that the Tories should 
‘identify a handful of issues that really matter to people and actually 
do something about them’.

A No 10 source said there were ‘currently no 
plans’ to increase Mrs Cameron’s public appearances.

Mr Cameron has already hired 
strategist Lynton Crosby, who masterminded Boris Johnson’s two London 
mayoral election victories, to help run the campaign in 2015.

Senior Tories have since suggested 
that the party turn to the London Mayor to help woo voters, and say Mr 
Johnson has agreed to play a leading role as a ‘frontman’ in the 
campaign.
