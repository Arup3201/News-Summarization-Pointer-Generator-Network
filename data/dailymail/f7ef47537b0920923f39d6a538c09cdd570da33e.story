Kim Sears has been subjected to a vile online backlash from Czech tennis fans after her courtside outburst while supporting fiancée Andy Murray.

Sick trolls have posted hateful messages on a Facebook fan page dedicated to Miss Sears, who appeared to call Murray's opponent Tomas Berdych a 'Czech flash f***' during a tense moment in yesterday's Australian Open semi final.

The hurtful posts say they hope Miss Sears 'dies', and that she 'deserves a couple of slaps' for her foul-mouthed rant during the match.

Ms Sears was caught on camera using colourful language as Murray secured a break in the third set to put himself firmly in control of the match with Czech Tomas Berdych

During one of the highly-charged moments in yesterday's match, Miss Sears, 27, appeared to hurl a string of expletives in the direction of the Czech player.

As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’.

The sickening messages were written just hours after Murray emerged victorious from his duel with Berdych, sending the Briton into the final.

Posting on the unofficial Facebook page, Pavel Kratochvil, from Prague, wrote: 'Die. you s***.'

Karel Zelezny added: 'F***ing English B****! Such a f***ing p****. You deserve someone to give you couple of slaps.'

While David Carbol added: 'Little stupid cow. I'm czech.'

Other posts called Miss Sears a 'bad sport s***', a 'silly stupid girl' and a 'British f***'. 

Abuse flooded in just hours after Murray's victory, with expletive-ridden posts filling the Kim Sears fan page

Last night Andy Murray was quick to defend his fiance, saying that the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match.

He told reporters: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal.

'The whole first set, everyone was tight. My physical trainer, physio, I'm sure for Dani it was uncomfortable.

'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' 

The dramatic outburst came as Murray won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7.

Luckily, there were no microphones nearby to pick up her exact choice of colourful words - but it was evident Ms Sears was deeply invested in the match.

Amid the vile backlash, hundreds of people pledge their support for Miss Sears, who has often remained quiet and reserved during matches.

German tennis player Andrea Petkovic tweeted, in capitals: 'I love Kim Sears so much.'

Comedian Jack Whitehall also took to Twitter and said: 'Anyone else find Kim Sears incredibly sexy when she's angry?' 

Television presenter Anita Rani said: 'Kim Sears swears! So f***ing what? Newsflash - women swear.'

It was the first time Murray had played Berdych (pictured) since he hired Murray's former coach, which no doubt added a fiery edge to the match

The highly-charged match was the first time Murray and Berdych had come head-to-head since the latter hired Murray's former trainer Dani Vallverdu. 

Mr Vallverdu helped Murray win his two grand slam titles and an Olympic gold before they stopped working together in November.

Speaking on court, Murray said: 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We've been friends since we were 15 and I felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary.

'This is sport, there is more to life and I thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension. 

'It was there definitely at the beginning but I think everyone calmed down after the start of the match.'

But the Scot also used his victory to heap praise on his coach, Amelie Mauresmo.

He said: 'A lot of people criticised me for working with her and I think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well. 

'Madison Keys, who reached the semi-finals here, is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward so I am very thankful to Amelie for doing it.

'I would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.'  

Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final on Sunday morning after the Serb defeated Swiss player Stanislas Wawrinka.

The pair, both 27, had been together for nine years when Murray proposed in November last year

Kim Sears' astonishing court-side outburst quickly went viral.

The video showing her swearing profusely, apparently at Berdych, was soon retweeted thousands of times on Twitter.

Very quickly 'Kim Sears' was trending on Twitter and remains in the top 10 this morning - making her one of the most tweeted about topics in the last 24 hours.

For the most part social media users have been supportive, with many finding her unexpected aptitude for swearing both funny and endearing. 

As the video and subsequent pictures went viral, she was branded 'a legend' and 'hilarious' by people on Twitter and Facebook.

Kim was even given the 'Thug Life' treatment - a spoof meme which juxtaposes unlikely subjects with a Tupac Shakur quote.
