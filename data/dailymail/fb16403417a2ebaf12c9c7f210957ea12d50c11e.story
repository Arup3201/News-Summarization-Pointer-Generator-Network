It was 42 minutes past midnight when Gareth Bale shared a photograph of his Champions League winners’ medal with his three-point-something million Twitter followers.

Very soon, it had been retweeted more than 10,000 times. A picture of him holding the European Cup aloft had been posted little more than an hour before and proved to be even more popular.

Somewhere in between the two, he shuffled through the interview area in the concrete bowels of Benfica’s Stadium of Light, bashful and reluctant to stop and dwell on the most amazing night of his professional life.

Some of his team-mates couldn’t stop talking. They left still wearing their white Real match-shirts, or the specially printed “La Decima” tee-shirts, but Bale looked slick and well-groomed, fresh in his black club suit and skinny tie, with a silver gong dangling from his neck on a blue ribbon.

He did not even look in the slightest bit tired. That’s euphoria (and supreme fitness levels) for you. He had the medal, he had lifted the trophy every footballer wants to get their hands on and Bale had made a vital contribution.

Perhaps it was not THE most vital contribution. That accolade belongs to Sergio Ramos. Real Madrid were around 120 seconds from heartbreak when he headed in the equaliser which took the game into extra-time.

Without Ramos, leaping to score in the 93rd minute from a Luka Modric corner, this would have been a tale of woe for Bale, a disappointment at the end of an otherwise promising first campaign in Spain when he shouldered manfully the burden of being the world’s most expensive footballer.

There would have been no extra 30 minutes for Bale and Angel di Maria to display their phenomenal stamina and running ability against an industrious Atletico Madrid team who were quickly running out of steam.

Until the Ramos equaliser, Bale would have been cast as a villain rather than a hero. He had missed good chances, clear chances, one in each half, with another, much sharper chance in between.

He had missed the target with them all and yet, even while performing poorly in front of goal, he had offered much great threat than either Karim Benzema or Cristiano Ronaldo.

His moment came after 110 minutes. Few would have had the power in their legs at this stage of the night to have followed in Di Maria’s shot with such energy and expectation. It was a fine example of his desire and determination, despite earlier misses, to follow the ball. He would not hide.

When Di Maria’s effort hit Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois on the foot and spun into the air it sat perfectly for him to spring and convert a header from a yard or so, and Bale became the first Welshman to score in the European Cup final and the 20th Brit.

For the record, the other 19 are: Tommy Gemmell (2), Stevie Chalmers, Bobby Charlton, Brian Kidd, George Best, Terry McDermott, Tommy Smith, Phil Neal (2), Kenny Dalglish, John Robertson, Alan Kennedy, Trevor Francis, Peter Withe, Teddy Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard, Sol Campbell, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney.

This was far removed from Bale’s exhilarating solo goal to win the Copa del Rey against Barcelona last month and yet so much more meaningful and precious to a club which has been obsessed for the last 12 years with winning their tenth European title.

At last, here it is and Bale was central to it all. His goal destroyed Atletico to such an extent that they conceded two more goals, the sort typically conceded by weary and exhausted teams.

It was to all intents and purposes the killer strike - the winner-  although everyone in the Real camp seemed relieved when Ronaldo managed to engineer and then convert a penalty and spare them all the inevitable sulk.

This was supposed to be his night in Lisbon – the stage had been set after all - but not even the over-worked and self-important celebration of the otherwise meaningless fourth goal could distract from the fact this was ultimately about more than one man.

Real Madrid achieved their dream and Bale played a key part. Nine months after leaving Tottenham he could not dared to have hope for more.
