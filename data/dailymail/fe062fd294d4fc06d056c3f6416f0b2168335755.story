The family of GP Elizabeth Kinston, 37, pictured with daughter Elise, have paid tribute to 'an amazing mum, daughter, sister, wife and friend'

The family of a GP whose body was found on grassland two weeks after she went missing from her home has paid tribute to 'our beautiful Lizzie'.

Mother-of-two Elizabeth Kinston, 37, was last seen on November 1 after leaving her home in Beeston, Nottinghamshire.

Today her devastated family released a statement calling her 'an amazing mum, daughter, sister, wife and friend'.

Mrs Kinston, who leaves husband David, 36, and daughters Sophia, three, and Elise, 10 months, had been battling with post-natal depression since the birth of her second child in January.

Officers searching for the popular family doctor, who had been on maternity leave, discovered her body in the Dunkirk area of Nottingham last Thursday.

Nottinghamshire Police said formal identification had now taken place and that her family had been informed.

In a statement, Ms Kinston’s family thanked people for their support and police for their efforts during the search.

They said: 'We would like to thank all of our friends, her patients and members of the public who have offered support, love and well wishes during the last few weeks.

'A special thanks to the police, who worked tirelessly.

'Our beautiful Lizzie was found resting peacefully on Thursday 14 November.

'We love her so much and are so incredibly proud of everything she achieved during her wonderful life.

'An amazing mum, daughter, sister, wife and friend. We love you Lizzie.'

The GP’s body was found by officers 
on grassland near Enterprise Way just after noon last Thursday, leaving 
her husband 'beyond heartbroken'.

The find came after emotional appeals were made by Mr Kinston and Mrs Kinston's sister Charlotte for her to return home.

Post-mortem tests have been carried out on her body but the results are expected to take several weeks.

Nottinghamshire
Police said they are not treating the death as suspicious at this stage
and that a file is being prepared for the coroner.

The mother of two failed to return home on November 1 and later that morning was captured 
on CCTV walking past a pub near Nottingham railway station.

Members
of the public saw her in her Audi at a petrol station and at a car
park in Nottingham, where it was found in the car park the next day,
with her purse and phone still inside.

Dr Kinston worked as a GP at a medical centre in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, but had been on maternity leave since Elise’s birth.

Previously 
Mr Kinston had said: ‘She went to the doctor’s because she wasn’t 
sleeping and was anxious. We’d had a discussion, not just myself and 
her, the family as well, and we thought she should go and seek advice.’

He also described how his wife, a devoted mother, had been tearful as 
she said a final goodbye to her family on the day she disappeared.

Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic)

Feeling 'low' after having a baby, 
also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, 
but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and 
long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND).

It
usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on 
gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite
severe.

Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby.  They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel hopeless about the future.

Many of those who 
suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say that if PND 
is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and to be less 
severe.

Treatments for PND 
include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be
very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered 
for short-term use.

Some 
women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, 
and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and 
anxiety.

Practical and 
emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a 
great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other 
parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and 
anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an 
antidepressant.

Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness
provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering 
from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 
Monday-Friday 10am-2pm.

Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401.

Other telephone helplines available 24 hours a day include Parentline on 0808 800 2222 or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90.
