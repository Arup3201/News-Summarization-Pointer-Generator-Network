Two people have died and 16 have been hospitalized in North Carolina after contracting a superbug which led to the deaths of two patients in Los Angeles.

Eighteen people have contracted carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, in the state so far this year, officials have confirmed. 

Kevin McCarthy, a spokesman with the Carolinas HealthCare System, told CNN 15 of the patients had CRE upon admission to the unnamed hospital in Charlotte, three acquired it in the hospital.

Concerning: Health officials give a news conference outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center of Los Angeles after seven people contracted a killer superbug. Eighteen people have also been diagnosed with the deadly strain in Charlotte, North Carolina 

It comes after two people died at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center last week after routine endoscopic procedures. 

Seven people, including an eighteen-year-old man, were diagnosed with the superbug and has been linked to surgical tools used on as many as 500,000 patients. 

Officials warned that as many as 179 people who had endoscopies at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center may have been exposed to the so-called superbug. The procedures were done between October 3 and January 28.

All five of the confirmed infected patients who remain alive are under treatment, said UCLA spokeswoman Dale Tate.

The infections all occurred during procedures in which a specialized scope, known as a duodenoscope, was inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases. The outbreak has raised questions about whether methods for cleaning the endoscopes were adequate.

The 18-year-old man, whose name has not been released, was among those infected by CRE, said attorney Kevin Boyle, a member of his legal team.

The man went to the medical center in mid-2014 for a pancreatic ailment and received an endoscopy, Boyle said. The man became ill and was hospitalized a short time later.

By November, he had been diagnosed with CRE. The youth spent 83 days in the hospital, mostly in the intensive care unit, the attorney said.

'It's definitely a severe infection,' he said, adding that the infection had landed the young man back in a Los Angeles hospital. The 18-year-old was not in the intensive care unit but was under 24-hour monitoring.

'The (man's) prognosis is unknown,' Boyle said on Saturday. He would not give the name of the hospital where the young man is being treated.

Deadly strain: The patients were infected with the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria (artists impression). It has been linked to an endoscope used in routine procedures 

Further details on the conditions of the five infected patients have not been disclosed, and details on the circumstances of the two deaths have not been made public.

Officials have said there is no broader threat to public health, and that hospital officials have called and sent letters to at-risk former patients. 

All of them are at home, rather than at a hospital, Tate said. No further infections have been reported.

Corey Egel, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health, said the short-term risk window for additional CRE infections among the patients who came into contact with the scopes was over.

There remains, however, a possibility of future infections if the organism was able to colonize inside any of the patients.

'Any person who is colonized with any multi-drug resistant organism is at some increased risk in the future of developing an infection with that organism,' he said.

The medical center has said that it had been sterilizing the duodenoscopes implicated in the infection, which it began using in June, according to manufacturer standards. It has said it now uses a more rigorous process that exceeds national standards.

The two infected scopes were immediately removed from use for return to the manufacturer, Olympus Medical Systems Group . Olympus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients.

California's public health department said no other hospitals in the state have seen a similar outbreak.
