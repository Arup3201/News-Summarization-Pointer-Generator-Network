Gus Poyet will make changes to the team thrashed 8-0 at Southampton when Arsenal visit the Stadium of Light on Saturday.

And the Black Cats boss says no player can complain if they find themselves axed from the starting XI.

‘Whatever I want to do on Saturday I can do it – freedom,’ he said.

‘My common sense can go away, I can pick the team I want. No-one can disagree.

‘Because of the squad I can’t change 10, and 75 per cent of the team will have the chance to play. But I would like to play the game now.’

The squad met to go over the club-record loss on Tuesday, and Poyet went on: ‘I didn’t want to see them on Sunday and we had something already planned for Monday.

‘We had a unique meeting on Tuesday. I’m not a great fan of looking at so many negative things, but this was an exception.

‘It was very quiet, as quiet as I remember. It wasn’t easy for anyone. I imagine they felt embarrassed.’

Poyet hinted earlier this week that he was not responsible for the depth of his squad and has since signed defender Anthony Reveillere.

And he added: ‘We are still waiting for international clearance.

‘But we are short of defenders, that’s no secret. He will be involved.

‘I meant exactly what I said – I have four defenders and I played four defenders.’
