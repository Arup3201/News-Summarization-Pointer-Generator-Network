This cat has outlived all of her nine lives.

Tiffany Two, a tortoiseshell feline holds the Guinness World Record for the oldest living cat and reached another milestone Friday when she turned 27 years old.

The cat, who was born on March 13, 1988 in San Diego, California has now lived the equivalent of 125 human years.

Owner: Sharon Voorhees, pictured, paid just $10 for Tiffany Two when the cat was just six weeks old and has been caring for her ever since

Tiffany Two's owner Sharon Voorhees said she paid just $10 for the cat when she bought her from a pet store at six weeks old.

She boasts that it was the 'best money she ever spent.'

According to the Guinness World Records the short-haired black and orange tortoiseshell is officially the world's oldest living cat. 

Voorhees recalls that at the time she bought Tiffany Two she also purchased two dogs, born around the same time, but they died years ago.

Meanwhile, she explains that the cat's unusual name was  a tribute to another tortoiseshell cat she owned in the 1970s.

And while the 27-year-old is generally in good health, she does suffer from high blood pressure.

But Vorhees says she still enjoys roaming around outside and is 'not feeble and still able to go up and down stairs'.

Years ago, Tiffany Two had a stint on the open road after she went missing for two years. It's not known where she went. 

Today, she enjoys  staying inside but does venture outdoors sometimes. 

Voorhees said: 'She's not afraid of anything or anyone. She walks right past the dogs, she's very feisty!'

As Tiffany Two  grows old gracefully she still has good sight and hearing and eats both 'wet food and dry food.'

However, the record-breaker is not the oldest cat ever recorded throughout history.

That achievement belongs to a feline from Austin, Texas, called Creme Puff who was born on 3 August 1967 and died on until 6 August 2005 at the ripe old age of 38.

Milestone: Her owner Sharon Voorhees has kept pictures of her cat's growth since 1988
