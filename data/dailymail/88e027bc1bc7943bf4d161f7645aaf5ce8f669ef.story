A grandmother was left with horrific cuts and bruises to her face and neck after new tiling created an optical illusion that hid a trip hazard.

The new paving in Pontypridd, South Wales, has been blamed for a spate of falls after more than 20 shoppers were taken to hospital.

The patterned tiles, part of a £10.5million town centre makeover, has created a hidden trap for many unable to spot the edge of the kerb.

Treacherous trip hazard: Morfydd Jenkins, 75, suffered horrific cuts and bruises to her face and neck after tripping on new tiles in the Pontypridd town centre which created an optical illusion

Grandmother Morfydd Jenkins, 75, was left badly bruised when she fell over on the tiles while rushing to get a bus.

She said: ‘I was going to the bus stop and all I remember is falling over the kerb - I didn’t see it.

‘I was taken to hospital and had X-rays and I had a lot of bruising and cuts to my face and neck.

‘I’m feeling alright now but I’m much more cautious about going out on my own.’

The tile pattern at street level is 
very similar to the loading bay - four inches below - and many pedestrians are 
unable to see the drop.

Can you see the kerb? The new tiles (pictured) have created an optical illusion, hiding the edge of the kerb on Taff Street

Optical illusion: This is the kerb after the redesign, blamed for the spate of falls. It is four inches above ground level and on a slight slope

Before the revamp: On the left is the spot before the £10.5m revamp of the town centre. The revamp was completed in May and aimed to make the town safer

The Welsh Ambulance Service said it had been called to the spot 20 times since the redesign was completed in May.

Cheryl
 Hull, manager of Shaws the Drapers, works opposite the paving stones 
and has already called an ambulance for around 10 shoppers.

She said: ‘The regeneration made them the same colour and this is causing an optical illusion.

‘It tends to blend into one - some people see the edge of the kerb but others don’t.

‘Surely they can do something to try to highlight the pavement. At some angles it can look as if it’s all one level.

‘I think when older people are rushing for the bus, they might not see it, especially as their eyesight tends to be bad.

Safety first: The new tiling has been blamed for a spate of falls after more than 20 shoppers have been taken to hospital

‘And
 at that age they fall quite heavily and some of the people I’ve helped 
have been quite badly hurt. At that age, it can really be a big deal 
too.’

Sarah Crumb, who works at Age Cymru directly across the road from the troublesome spot, has seen plenty of people fall.

She said: ‘Obviously they’re mostly elderly people but I’ve seen some young people fall too.

‘It’s slightly sloped and even though the tiles are different shades, a lot of people say they can’t see the difference where the step is.

Town revamp: The new tiling is part of a £10.5m makeover of the Pontypridd town centre

‘Maybe it should be painted with a yellow line to make it stand out. It wouldn’t be as pretty but safety is more important.’

Rhondda Cynon Taf Council claimed the revamp, completed in May this year, had made the town centre safer.

A spokesman said: ‘Accessibility throughout Pontypridd has been greatly improved due to the regeneration scheme.

‘Throughout the town improvements have been made with more accessible floor surfaces.

‘We have introduced flat surfaces where possible which greatly assists those with mobility issues.

‘There are some areas in the town that do require a kerb to ensure services such as buses and

deliveries to shops can continue to be provided.’

The council is yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment on how they would deal with the safety issue.
