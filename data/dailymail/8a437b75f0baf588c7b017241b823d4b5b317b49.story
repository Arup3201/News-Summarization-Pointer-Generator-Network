Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has taken the time to post pictures of his wife and smiling schoolchildren online, despite the bloody civil war that is tearing his country apart.

The pictures of a grinning and waving al-Assad, his British-born wife Asma and jubilant youngsters appeared on his Instagram account, enraging human rights groups.

The President's pictures were posted a short time after another batch of photos showing the harrowing state of obliterated cities like Homs was released.

project an image of normality

More than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the Syrian conflict since it started two years ago

But as millions have fled the fighting to neighbouring states, the Syrian regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life-as-normal image for the President.

In his Instagram account - where pictures were first posed on July 24 - the leader can be seen smiling, doing paperwork, meeting children and waving to cheering crowds.

His wife Asma is also featured on the account speaking to smiling school children and tasting home-cooked food.

An Amnesty International campaigner said: 'No 
amount of photos or tweets or Facebook posts will ever wash away the 
stain on the Syrian government's record'

Cynicism: Instagram users stated their incredulity at the pictures

Nadim Houry, deputy director for Human Rights Watch in the Middle East and East Africa, said Al-Assad's Instagram account was something different to previous leaders like the deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

He said: 'I think it is a generational thing, I am not aware older leaders like Mubarak and Gaddafi used social networking, but the Syrian regime has always been keen to show a business-like image to the world.

'I am not surprised by this account, but it is a parallel between the regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality for the people subjected to the bombs, arbitrary arrests, human rights abuses and violence.

'Bashar Al-Assad is not going to show the millions of people displaced, it's not going to show attacks on civilians.'

Amnesty International UK Syria campaign manager, Kristyan Benedict, said: 'On one level you'd have to say that it's not surprising to find any government, even the rigid and oppressive one in Damascus, using social media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view.

'Image obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative stability is important in President Assad's "love me or I'll kill you" strategy.

'Naturally, we'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in Syria - of the torture chambers or places of execution. Seeing the Assads in hospitals only reminds you of the fact that Syrian government hospitals have been used as places of torture.

'No amount of photos or tweets or Facebook posts will ever wash away the stain on the Syrian government's record.'
