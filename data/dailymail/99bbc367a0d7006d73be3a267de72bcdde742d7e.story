They were young men - aged 17, 18 and 20 - when they were sentenced to death in 1975 for a crime they didn't commit.

Now three childhood friends who were wrongly imprisoned for nearly 40 years have sat down together for their first proper interview since being exonerated in November, discussing how they are coping living in the 'new world', the lives they missed out on living, and the first thing they did after being freed.

Ricky Jackson, now 58 - who holds the U.S. record for  serving the longest time for a wrongful conviction, after 39 years, three months and nine days in prison - and Wiley Bridgeman, 60, walked free last year after the sole witness in their case confessed his testimony had been 'all lies'.

Ronnie Bridgeman, 57, Wiley's brother, was released on parole in 2003, after all three sentences were commuted to life  after a Supreme Court ruling in 1978.

'We all have scars that we are never going to be able to recover from,' Jackson told Fusion.

'A lot of people want us to feel bitter, resentful and spiteful, (but) i don't.

'That's something that happened. Everyone is going through something in their life. This was our something.' 

The men were convicted of the May 19, 1975, murder of Cleveland businessman Harry Franks, who was attacked, robbed and shot to death.

The trio had walked passed the crime scene and inquired what had happened, and not long after became the prime suspects. 

They were locked up, and believed everything would be 'straightened out', but were soon facing trial for Franks' murder. 

The prosecutions case was based on the testimony of a 12-year-old, Eddie Vernon, who said he saw the murder.

There was no physical evidence linking the three to Franks.

Vernon, now 52, eventually recanted his testimony, saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details about the case.

Changing his account in 2013, he said: 'All the information was fed to me - I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime', Cleveland.com reported.

Revisiting the scene: During the interview, the men returned to the street corner where Harry Franks was killed in 1975. They had walked by the scene, and quickly became suspects

A lifetime ago: Ohio businessman Harry Franks was attacked, robbed and shot to death on this Cleveland corner 40 years ago, and these three men were wrongly convicted of his murder

All three men were officially exonerated on November 21, 2014.

The ruling released Ricky Jackson and Wiley Bridgeman.

And it allowed them to be reunited - finally - with Ronnie Bridgeman, who has changed his name to Kwame Ajamu.

According to Fusion, a recent ruling by a judge that acknowledged all three were wrongly convicted makes each of them eligible for up to $40,000 from the state for every year were in prison.

That makes Jackson, the longest-serving, eligible for over $1.5 million. 

But money can't exactly make up for the lives that were stolen from each of them.

They each missed important funerals, and the experiencing of being involved with their families. 

But above all, they missed the chance to have families of their own.

'Whatever we lost is gone ... we can't ever recapture it,' Jackson said.

'I think the opportunity for justice to be served was lost the day we went to court. 

'None of us have kids. Just think about that alone. That's what they took away from us. 

'I'm not going to forget that.'

However the first thing the men did was go to lunch together at Red Lobster.

'I just wanted to go somewhere and talk and eat and drink,' Jackson said. 

'That day, I felt like I'd never been locked up.'

In the initial court hearings, Vernon said he was on a bus with other schoolchildren when he heard gunshots near the a grocery store called Cut-Rite.

Other children on the bus have said Vernon would not have been able to see anything from his seat - and he has since admitted that was true.

I'm out! Jackson walks smiling out of the jail after his sentence was quashed. He said he was on 'an emotional high' from being freed

He now claims detectives talked him into testifying, then said if he claimed he was lying his parents could be put in prison for perjury.

When he dismissed Jackson's case, Judge Richard McMonagle said, 'Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.'

'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling,' Jackson, 57, said as he exited the building Friday. 'I'm on an emotional high.'

Bridgeman, 60, said he never lost hope that he would be freed for good.

'You keep struggling, you keep trying,' he said.

Bridgeman embraced his brother Ronnie, who changed his name to Kwame Ajamu, as he walked out of the courthouse.

All he could say was that he is unsure what the future holds other than a celebratory fish dinner.

Ajamu told him: 'Stick with me. You'll be all right. I ain't never going to let you go.'

Jackson and his lawyers planned to celebrate Friday at a hotel. Asked where he was going to live, Jackson replied: 'It's ironic. For 39 years, I've had a place to stay. Now, you know, that's precarious.'

Ajamu said in an interview Thursday that the prospect of the three being together again is 'mind-boggling.' He spent his 18th birthday on death row and was in prison when his mother, a brother and a sister died.

He said: 'The idea that my brother - both of those guys are my brothers - are getting out? I don't even care about me.'

The Bridgemans' death sentences were commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1978. Jackson's sentence was commuted in 1977 because of a technical mistake.

Their cases were first re-evaluated after a 2011 article in the Cleveland Scene magazine highlighted Vernon's unreliable testimony. 

Vernon broke down during a court hearing for Jackson on Tuesday as he described the threats by detectives and the burden of guilt he had carried for so long.

Jackson said he holds no animosity toward Vernon.

'It took a lot of courage to do what he did,' he said. 'He's been carrying a burden around for 39 years, like we have. But in the end, he came through, and I'm grateful for that.' 

Joe Frolik, a spokesman for county prosecutor Tim McGinty, declined to comment on Thursday except to reiterate a statement McGinty made Tuesday: 'The state concedes the obvious.'
