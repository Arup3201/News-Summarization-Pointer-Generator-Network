A seven-year-old boy battling an inoperable brain tumour has been honoured as a ‘hero’ by his school friends who donned their capes and wands in tribute.

Jack Norman was diagnosed with his fourth brain tumour this year and in October his family were given the devastating news that surgery was no longer an option.

Showing their support for the much loved boy, students and teachers at Marrickville West Primary School, in Sydney’s inner west, posed for a colourful school photo in his honour.

Batman, Superwoman, Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles and a handful of Elsa’s from the Disney film Frozen all walked through the school gates on Thursday.

Principal Ruth Bradfield-Ling told Daily Mail Australia the idea for a superhero day was put forward by a member of staff at the school after a conversation with the children.

‘Jack is very well loved amongst our school community and is considered a bit of a hero,’ she explained.

‘His parents have proved themselves to be outstanding in courage and resilience to carry on in terms of the very difficult circumstance so we also wanted to acknowledge their heroisms and give the kids something a little bit fun.’

Jack's family and the NSW Police Legacy Charity are raising money to give him the best quality of life 

Earlier this year Jack and his family appeared in a video for Cancer Council to help raise awareness 

Jack’s father Craig, who works for the NSW Police Force, commented on the moving photos: ‘Thank you everybody, we've told Jack about the pictures and he was very happy. His sister will be too when she sees them, lots of Frozen outfits there!’

Jack was diagnosed with his first brain tumour in 2012, halfway through his first year at Marrickville West Primary School.

He was four years old when he began suffering symptoms including including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of concentration and lethargy.

But his cancer was not diagnosed by a doctor until he collapsed in a capark while shopping with his dad.

After being rushed to hospital a CT scan revealed a tumour at the base of his brain and life-saving surgery followed.

Over the past two years he has fought three more occurrences of the cancer with his father Craig, mother Tanya and little sister Sophie by his side.

Jack has suffered permanent hearing loss and is currently undergoing radiation therapies to try to shrink the inoperable tumour behind his eyes.

His family continue to discuss treatment options with his medical team at Sydney Children's Hospital, in Randwick, to give him the best possible quality of life.
