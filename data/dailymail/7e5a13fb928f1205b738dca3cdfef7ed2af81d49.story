Manchester United star Angel di Maria's traumatised wife has told her husband she's unwilling to return to their family home after thugs attempted to smash their way into the house using scaffold poles.

Jorgelina Cardoso has told di Maria, 26, she never wants to return to their family home in Cheshire after she was left shaken and traumatised by the terrifying raid on Saturday night.

The couple, along with their one-year-old daughter Mia, were at home eating dinner when the gang of three tried to break through patio doors just hours after Manchester United's victory over Leicester City.

The family have been staying at the Lowry Hotel in Manchester following the harrowing ordeal. Here the couple are pictured giving their daughter Mia a kiss at Christmas time

On Sunday Manchester United placed security guards at their house, while photographs of the property showed a window was boarded up.

The couple were whisked to the Lowry Hotel in Manchester after the attack and remain staying there in a bid to ease Mrs Cardoso's concerns,The Sun reported.

A source told the paper: 'Angel's wife is completely freaked out.

'She has told Angel that she never wants to go back. She may calm down in time but she is very family oriented so she has been really shaken by what happened.'

The former Real Madrid winger was shadowed by a security guard on Sunday as he drove from his hotel in his Range Rover.

Di Maria's agent confirmed the incident on Sunday and Cheshire police are investigating reports of a burglary.

'At 7.30pm on Saturday, January 31, police received reports of a burglary at a house in Prestbury,' a spokesman told MailOnline.

'A number of offenders tried to gain access to the property by trying to smash the back door.

'The alarm was raised before the men got inside and they fled the scene.'

The Argentina international signed for Manchester United from Real Madrid in August for a British record transfer fee of £59.7million, moving to Cheshire with his wife, who he married in 2011, and daughter, who is almost 22-months-old. 

Due to its proximity to both Manchester and Liverpool, Cheshire is popular with Premier League footballers and several players' homes have been targeted by burglars in the past.

Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka was robbed at knifepoint at his home near Knutsford in 2009.

Stoke striker Peter Crouch suffered two break-ins, in 2011 and 2006, at two properties he's owned in Cheshire.

United star Darren Fletcher's wife and mother were threatened with a knife when raiders burst into their home in Bowdon in 2009.

Little Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013. He and his wife have backed charity Unicef's campaign to raise awareness of premature babies

And the wife of Bolton striker Emile Heskey was also held at knifepoint when a gang raided their mansion in Hale during his time with Wigan Athletic in 2008.

The series of raids led to claims that top footballers were installing panic rooms in their homes. 

Di Maria's daughter Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013 - the night before her father's then team Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League semi-final.

Di Maria missed the game to be with his wife and their baby spent the next two months in intensive care before the couple were allowed to take her home.

The footballer has previously said of his little girl: ‘My daughter taught me that everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put the effort in and wait for the rewards.

‘She transmitted so much energy to me and it helped me to have the spectacular year that I had.’ 

Di Maria’s wife had suffered pregnancy complications and doctors had given the couple’s baby a 30 per cent chance of survival if the birth was not induced
