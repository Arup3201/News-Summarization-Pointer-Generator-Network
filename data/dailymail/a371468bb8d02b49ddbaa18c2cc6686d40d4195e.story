Ikea customers say the furniture store is the latest to be hit by a delivery backlog - with some claiming packages have been dropped off after midnight.

A huge boom in online shopping and a rush before Christmas has seen delivery drivers for a number of companies struggle to keep up with soaring demand.

Courier firm Yodel admitted it was delivering items up to two days late earlier this month following huge sales on so-called Cyber Monday.

Ikea is said to be the latest hit by the problems, with some customers in London reporting long waits and late deliveries

Joanna Bird (pictured with daughter Lili) was among customers left fuming after their Ikea deliveries took hours - and in some case days - to arrive as the company deals with huge pre-Christmas orders

Joanna Bird, a mother-of-one from Pinner in the north west of the capital said she was forced to twice delay the delivery of a children's wardrobe after a  driver couldn't arrive until late in the evening, when her child would be asleep.

The 40-year-old bookbinder said: 'I was expecting the delivery before 9pm on the day I bought it as I paid £30 for same day delivery.

'When the driver phoned up at 10.30pm and said he was on his way I just told him it was too late as my four-year-old was fast asleep and I told him to come back the next day.

'I thought it would arrive at a sensible time, but at 9pm I was calling Ikea to complain, but couldn't get through for more than an hour.

'The driver then phoned up just after 10pm and said he would be late and I told him to forget it.

 'When the same thing happened the next day - three days in a row - I couldn't believe it.

'The driver eventually called at 10.30pm and told me he was on his way I just thought I should get it over and done with otherwise I'd never get it. The driver said he was desperate to 'get rid' of the wardrobe.

'He arrived at midnight and he said he still had a couple of deliveries to do.

She added: ''When I asked him if he thought it was appropriate to be delivering stuff after midnight he just shrugged his shoulders and said he "had his orders".

'What really get to me is that I ended up paying to phone the Ikea hotline endless times and they never apologised - all they did was give me the £30 delivery charge back.

'The emailed apology even got my name wrong and called me Mr Bird and said the case was resolved to my satisfaction, which it most certainly wasn't.'

Another customer in Watford, north of the capital, said he had waited in for four days running earlier this month  after being told £1,500 of furniture would be delivered before 9pm. It eventually turned up at 11.15pm, four days later.

Customers of Ikea living in London say they are having to wait hours for pre-Christmas deliveries to arrive

The 35-year-old said: 'The driver never called before 9pm, often calling around 10pm and no matter what I did - or what I told Ikea customers services - the delivery was four days late.

'The first day I got a call about 10.30pm saying he was on his way and nobody turned up by 11.30pm so I went to bed and put in some earplugs.

'The next day it took me an hour to get through to customer service and they were no good at all - they just said my furniture would arrive before 9pm.

'Safe to say it didn't and I got a call again after 10pm, but I was out with friends by then, so told him to come back to next day.

'The third day I heard nothing and the furniture eventually arrived four days after I ordered it, arriving at 11.15pm.'

Customers have also taken to Twitter to complain about the Swedish chain. 

London's Verity Symes tweeted: '@IKEA two days waiting in for delivery, no phone call, no help from your call centre other than they don't care if I cancel?!?'

Natalia Barua, also living in the capital, added: '@IKEA 4 failed deliveries and a total call waiting time of 2.5 hours in 1 week.Incompetent delivery providers & call centre team.'

Ikea has yet to comment on whether deliveries are being made after midnight.

But Gerard Bos, Customer Relations Manager, apologised for late deliveries, saying that 'elements outside the control of the delivery crew' could mean they were delivered after 9pm.

He said: 'We do everything possible to deliver to our customers within their communicated time window.

'Occasionally elements outside of our control can affect our deliveries as planned. We appreciate that late deliveries can be frustrating so in such circumstances, we always attempt to make contact to check if it is still convenient to deliver or if a new delivery slot should be arranged.

'We apologise for any inconvenience caused by late deliveries and are continuously looking for ways to improve our services for the future.'

Yodel has said its delivery backlog has now been cleared.

A spokesman said: 'Yodel is now operating a normal Christmas service and we're working to make sure that all deliveries are made as swiftly as possible.'

It comes after delivery company Yodel suffered a huge backlog following huge online sales before Christmas
