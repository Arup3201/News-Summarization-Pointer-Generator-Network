Antonia shows off her fabulous new figure

Last week I revealed how I lost  my pregnancy weight thanks to the latest scientifically proven exercise regime that involves just three sessions of less than 15 minutes  a week.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can transform your figure more effectively than spending twice as long on more moderate exercises.

The key is working out as hard as you can in short bursts.

After I embarked on a routine under the guidance of Zana Morris, owner of The Library gym in West London, I lost an astonishing 10 lb in six weeks - and I was exercising just 38 minutes a week.

Last week I detailed the exercises I did for each of the three sessions - for legs, chest and back, and shoulders and arms.

Today, I reveal a three-minute ab-blaster, plus some more of Zana's exercises.

Do these exercises in order every time you work out. Keep your knees together at all times to  make the exercises more efficient.

With all these exercises, if you end up tensing, you tend to hunch your shoulders and put strain on the neck. So remember: shoulders down and relaxed, neck long, face up to the ceiling. You should aim to be pulling with your core. If you struggle, start with sets of ten and work up to 20. The key to success is pace. Each workout should be performed correctly and as swiftly as possible. Do not rest.

FRONT CRUNCHES

HOW: Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, hands resting behind your ears.

Pushing your lower back into the floor, pull your upper back off the floor with your stomach muscles, aiming your chest to the ceiling.  Curl upwards and forwards. Keep your chin tilted slightly, leaving space between your chin and your chest.

Lower your body back to the floor. Repeat.

DO: 1 SET OF 20

SIDE CRUNCHES

HOW: Adopt the same position as front crunches.

Pushing your lower back into the floor, pull your upper back off the floor with your stomach muscles while twisting your upper body to  the right. Your left elbow should get as close to your right knee as possible without moving your arms from the start position

Lower your upper body to the  first position.

Pull your upper body off the floor while twisting your upper body to  the left, this time trying to get your right elbow close to your left knee.

Lower your body to the floor.  This is one rep. Repeat.

Fighting fit: Antonia's story last week

DO: 1 SET OF 20

SIDE BENDS

HOW: Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, elbows out and hands resting  behind your ears. Lift your upper back 4in off the floor.

Using your abdominal muscles and keeping your upper back the same distance from the floor, swing your upper body from your waist as far as you can to the right, towards your lower body. Try to get your right elbow close to your right knee.

Swing your body back to first position and without pausing repeat the movement to your left side,  trying to get your left elbow as close as you can to your left knee.n Return to first position. This is one rep. Repeat.

DO: 1 SET OF 20

LOWER ABDOMINAL  LEG RAISES

HOW:
 Lie on your back with your upper back off the floor and arms on the 
floor straight by your sides. Bend your legs, knees together and lift 
your feet until your calves  are parallel to the floor. n Using your
 lower abdominals, lift your bottom  off the floor bringing your knees 
as close to your chest as possible. Keep your legs relaxed.n Lower your bottom back to the floor. Repeat.DO: 1 SET OF 20

SIDE ABDOMINAL  LEG RAISES

HOW:
 Lie on your back, with your arms on the floor straight by your sides 
and legs bent at a 45 degree angle, and feet on the floor.

Lie on your back, with your arms on the floor straight by your sides and legs bent at a 45 degree angle

While trying to keep your back flat on the floor, rotate your legs to the right, aiming to get your right knee to touch the floor. Your left hip will be facing up. Your left shoulder may naturally raise up a bit - that's OK.

Turn your head to the left (the opposite way to your knees), exhale, lift both legs off the floor, keeping them bent. Do not jerk or swing. n Inhale, lowering to the first position. Repeat.

DO: 2 SETS OF 20  (ONE SET ON EACH SIDE)

These can added to the relevant exercise day. For the first set, use the heaviest weight you can manage to complete the set.  The fifth repetition should be a slight struggle - any earlier and  the weight is probably too heavy. For subsequent sets, reduce the weight by one increment.

ABDUCTOR

HOW: This can be done standing at a cable machine with the weight attached to your ankle, but most gyms have a specific machine where you are seated.n Sit upright with legs bent, knees together and the weight pads on the outside of each knee. n Exhale, push knees against the weight pads until your legs are as far apart as possible.n Inhale, returning to first position. Repeat.DO: 3 SETS OF 6

ADDUCTOR

HOW: Again, most gyms have a specific machine. Sit upright, legs as far apart as possible with the weight pads on the inside of each knee.

Exhale, using your inner thigh muscles to bring weights together.

Inhale, return to first position. Repeat.

DO: 3 SETS OF 6

LATERAL RAISE

HOW: This can be done with free weights. Sit on a bench, back straight, arms bent, elbows bent by your sides and forearms straight out in front of you. Grasp a weight with each hand, palms facing towards each other.

Exhale, lift your elbows up so they are as high as your shoulders or slightly higher. Keep your arms bent, forearms straight in front of you.

Inhale, return to first position. Repeat.

DO: 3 SETS OF 6

TRICEPS PRESS

The cable should be at a  45-degree downward angle from the machine to your hands

HOW: This can be done at a cable machine with a wide bar grip attached to the high clip. Sit upright on a bench facing away from the machine. The cable should be at a  45-degree downward angle from the machine to your hands.

Bend your arms at right angles behind you, keeping elbows as close as possible to your head, forearms parallel to the floor, clasping the bar with your palms facing upwards.

Exhale, pull your forearms above your head until your arms are straight.

Inhale, return to first position. Repeat.

DO: 3 SETS OF 6

PULLOVER

HOW: This can be done on a  cable machine or with free weights. On a cable machine, position the bench 2ft from the machine.  A straight bar should be attached to the bottom clip or, if it's adjustable, move it so it's level with your head when you're  lying down.

Lie on your back. With your arms stretched straight behind you grab the bar. If using free weights, lie on the floor, knees bent, feet flat on  the floor, arms on the floor straight out behind you. Hold your weights, palms facing up.

Exhale, lift the weight in an arch over your head and forward, stopping when it is above your chest at around 45 degrees from the floor. Keep your elbows slightly bent and don't change the angle of your arms.

Inhale, return the weight to first position. Repeat.

DO: 3 SETS OF 6

HYPEREXTENSIONS

HOW: Use a hyperextension bench.

With ankles under the pads at your feet and arms crossed over your chest, hold your body straight, to form a diagonal line at about a  45-degree angle from the floor.

Exhale, bending at your waist only and keeping your back straight, slowly lower your upper body until your forehead faces the floor. Keep movement controlled and use only your lower back to move the weight, not your entire body.

Inhale, return to first position. Repeat.

DO: 1 SET OF 20

These workouts were designed as part of a supervised training programme. Supervision by a qualified instructor is highly recommended for the first six to 12 sessions. See a doctor to rule outhealth concerns before starting any fitness regime.
