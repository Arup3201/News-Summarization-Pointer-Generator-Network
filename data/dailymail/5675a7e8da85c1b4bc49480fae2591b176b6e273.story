She recently went to the U.S. to launch her daughter as a beauty pageant star. But Sarah Burge has made a swift return to the UK after being condemned on live television for giving her teenage daughter Botox injections.

But instead of shying away from the 
cameras the 51-year-old, self-confessed plastic surgery addict stepped
 off the plane and shuttled straight to a London television studio to appear on ITV's Daybreak.

Sporting a bronzed complexion and peroxide blonde hair the mother-of-three wheeled her youngest daughter Poppy, 8, out of Heathrow airport with a sparkling beauty pageant crown and certificate proudly on display.

The duo later appeared on breakfast television to discuss their time in America.

Miss Burge, who opted for a thigh skimming red dress met with Daybreak hosts - and this time her screen time wasn't cut short.

Last month American talk show host Anderson Cooper decided to stop his interview with her as she justified giving her 15-year-old daughter Botox injections.

'I
 would prefer to oversee my daughter's Botox than have her going 
underground finding a voodoo witchdoctor or getting it off the internet 
and administrating it herself,' she said defiantly.

But appalled by her behaviour, Anderson shook his head in disbelief stating: 'I try and to be really polite to all my guests. I just think you're dreadful and I honestly don’t want to talk to you anymore, so I’m just going to stop.'

She decided to relocate to the U.S. to launch Poppy as a child beauty pageant star, believing she could give the stars of the controversial show Toddlers & Tiaras a run for their money.

However her insistence on teaching her young daughters to pole dance, giving them vouchers to spend on plastic surgery and throwing them Botox parties has proved unpopular on both sides of the Atlantic.

Following the show Anderson added: 'I regret having here on in the first place. I think encouraging her little daughter to pole dance and giving her plastic surgery vouchers and then telling the media about it... I wish her the best, I certainly don’t want to be rude to anybody.'

But today on Daybreak Miss Burge portrayed her time in the U.S. in a posistive way and also revealed that she has secured a deal to front her own reality show.

Talking about her appearance on Anderson Copper's show she said: 'It was just drama, drama,  drama. We were actually over in America filming our own reality show.

'We were invited on the show and in my opinion he actually wanted to throw me off before I actually got on there. Everything gets distorted in the press. People only hear half the story.'

Miss Burge, who has spent more than £500,000 on her own surgical enhancements, first made headlines in 2010 when she confessed to teaching her then six-year-old daughter to pole dance.

And she has since been in the spotlight numerous times - for all the wrong reasons.

Last year Miss Burge, who then resided in a £500,000 four-bedroom home in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, boasted that she gave a £6,000 breast enlargement voucher to her daughter.

She said in an interview with Closer magazine at the time: 'Poppy begged me for a boob job, so I gave her the voucher so she can have it after she's 16, when it's legal. If she develops naturally big boobs, she can have something else done with it.'

The voucher was part of a £12,000 'exotic pamper party' that she organised to mark her daughter's birthday. Poppy and seven friends had manicures, pedicures and makeovers. They dressed up with fake tattoos, drank pretend champagne in the back of a pink pamper bus and ate a designer cake costing £250.

'I honestly don't want to talk to you anymore so I'm just going to stop,' Anderson told Miss Burge

Poppy wore a £300 dress for the party, adding nail varnish, eyeshadow and hair extensions. Miss Burge said: 'Poppy isn't interested in bouncy castles or pass the parcel, so I splashed out on something a little more grown-up.

'The girls got lots of attention from our neighbours. They love having all eyes on them and were posing and pouting for photos,' she said.

As well as the breast enlargement voucher, Miss Burge bought her daughter thousands of pounds worth of gifts, including a £250 computer, a £450 pink Swarovski crystal ring and necklace set and the promise of a £4,000 spa break. The main event though, was the breast enlargement voucher.

Poppy said: 'I wanted a new computer, a holiday and a voucher for surgery. When I got it all, it was a dream come true. All my friends were jealous. I can't wait to be like Mummy with big boobs. They're pretty.'

Anderson also asked Burge to explain the photos of her eight-year-old daughter (who was seven at the time) on a stripper pole, and points out, 'It doesn't just happen to wind up in the paper, you contact the British tabloids, you contact the papers and let them know about this stuff.'

Burge responded: 'I let people know that it's good, it's good exercise and in fact, more people should actually try it than stuffing their faces with burgers.'
