With his big, black eyes, forlorn expression and ginger fur, this adorable ginger cat bears an uncanny resemblance to the famous on-screen feline from the Shrek films.

And just like Puss in Boots - who is known for his ability to mesmerize characters with his wide-eyed gaze - Marty the cat knows how to get his own way by pulling the meek kitty cat expression.

Owner Colleen Pettit, 27, snapped the hilarious photograph when Marty realized he was unable to sit in his favorite spot on the sofa - Colleen's lap.

Puss in Boots was known for his ability to mesmerize characters in Shrek 2 with his wide-eyed meek gaze

In a desperate effort to get some cuddles, Marty is seen staring intently at his owner until she finally caves and puts her work to one side.

Colleen, who lives in San Francisco, said: 'Marty is very possessive of me.

'At the time of the photo, I was sitting on the couch with my computer on my lap, which is strictly his spot.

'I think the combination of my lap being occupied and my typing made him a little upset.

'I looked down and thought he looked so funny that I called for my partner, Cliff, to come and take a photo of him.

'The first thing I thought of when I looked at him was how much he looks like Puss in Boots from the Shrek movies.

Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas in Shrek, was known to switch from a bold fighter  into a meek pussycat who softened his enemies with his cute expression.

Colleen added: 'Marty demands for you to lie or sit a specific way and if you don't pet him enough, he will serve you a nice little 'love bite'.

'He is certainly a complex feline, he is very open with his feelings and lets us know if he hungry, playful, or in need of attention.

'It works every single time, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to give into a face like that.'
