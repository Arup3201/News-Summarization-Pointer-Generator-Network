It's a musuem curator's worst nightmare - a priceless antique falls off a table and breaks.

But that's what happened at the Spanish Royal Palace in Madrid where an extremely rare Stradivarius cello is reported to have broken while it was being handled by experts during a photoshoot.

An official at the palace has confirmed that the hand-crafted instrument, which is thought to be worth in excess of $20million (roughly £13million) has been damaged.

Bad note: A priceless Stradivarius cello, similar to the one shown here, worth an estimated $20million was damaged when it fell off a table during a photoshoot at the Royal Palace in Madrid.

However they refused to expand further on a report about the unfortunate incident which was printed in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo.

The newspaper said the instrument fell off a table during a photo session about three weeks ago, but exactly how it happened is yet to be confirmed.

Considered the best stringed instruments ever made, Stradivarius' cellos, violins lutes, mandolins, guitars and harps were all handcrafted by Antonio Stradivari in 17th and 18th century Italy.Stradivari designed and crafted more than 1,000 and other instruments during his lifetime, many of which still exist today.

They are considered the finest instruments ever made and continue to be the standard in form, sound and beauty.

The earliest known Stradivarius violin was made in 1666, when Stradivari was only 22-years-old.

During his golden period, Stradivari created violins whose sound boxes are unmatched even today.

Stradivari continued to craft unmatched instruments into his late 70s. As he grew older his work appears slightly less immaculate than his earlier creations. However, he continued to handcraft instruments until his death in 1737.

Today, artisans and scientists still try to recreate what can only be the beauty and sound of a Stradivarius instrument.

They are prized possessions housed in museums and personal collections around the world.

But some of the details about the damage the instrument sustained have been revealed.

A piece which joins the neck of the 17th century cello to its body broke and fell off.

The broken piece was not original but rather a replacement installed in the 19th century.

The official said the cello can and will be repaired, but the cost of this work and the breakage's impact on the instrument's value is not clear.

The official said it was part of a set of instruments which also included two violins and a viola which are together known as 'The Quartet'.

The cello is one of five antique instruments made by Italian Antonio Stradivari, renowned for the exquisite sound of his instruments, that were acquired by king Felipe V who ruled Spain at the turn of the 18th century.

The instruments were given the quartet name because they were commissioned at the same time.

Tim Ingles, head of the musical instrument department at Sotheby's auction house in London, placed the  $20 million price tag on the instrument.

Of the approximately 1100 legendary stringed instruments Stradivari made, only around 650 remain, including an estimated nine violas and 50 cellos.

Only the best musicians have had the honour of playing them.
