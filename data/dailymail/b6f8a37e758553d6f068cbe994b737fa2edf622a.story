Nass and MIT has given a spacecraft orbiting the moon a super high speed internet connection far faster than most users on Earth.

The team admit they were stunned by the results, which pave to way for 3D video and remote robotic exploration of other moons and planets.

The team say their groundbreaking test 'worked like gangbusters'.

The test, in October of last year, beamed data, via laser, at speeds reaching 622 megabits per second, to Earth from a spacecraft orbiting the moon.

Radio-frequency systems used for space communications today are usually tens of times slower.

'It worked like gangbusters,' Don 
Boroson, who led the LLCD design team at Lincoln Lab, and presented the 
demo’s results at the SPIE Photonics West conference said.

NASA and Lincoln Lab engineers tested the first-ever two-way laser link between the moon and the earth for about a month, according to Spectrum IEEE.

'The system did what it needed to do,' Boroson said.

'The concept is right, and the system is reliable. We think it’s ready for prime time.'

NASA’s follow-up laser communication mission, the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD), which is scheduled for launch in 2017, will attempt to establish laser links at a rate of over 1 gigabit per second between Earth and a satellite in geosynchronous orbit (which is ten times closer than the moon).

Nasa is planning to ditch primitive radio transmissions and start communicating with lasers in space. The experiment is part of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) mission which will be hosted aboard  LADEE satellite (pictured)

The LCRD will operate for five years in order to demonstrate the reliability of laser communication technology.

As well as HD video it could, for instance, also allow humans to remotely control machines for tasks such as asteroid mining or building structures on the moon.

LLCD is Nasa’s first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. 

‘The goal of the LLCD experiment is to validate and build confidence in this technology so that future missions will consider using it,’ said Don Cornwell, LLCD manager.

‘We can even envision such a laser-based system enabling a robotic mission to an asteroid,’ he added.

‘It could have 3D, high-definition video signals transmitted to Earth providing essentially “telepresence” to a human controller on the ground.’

Since Nasa first ventured into space, radio frequency (RF) communication has been the communications platform used. But it is now reaching its limit as demand for more data capacity increases.

According to Nasa, laser communication would be less likely to suffer from interference, another limitation of radio frequency (RF) signals.

‘LLCD is designed to send six times more data from the moon using a smaller transmitter with 25 per cent less power as compared to the equivalent state-of-the-art radio (RF) system,’ said Cornwell.

‘Lasers are also more secure and less susceptible to interference and jamming.’

The LLCD experiment is hosted aboard Nasa’s LADEE: a 100-day robotic mission designed, built, integrated, tested and will be operated by Ames.

The LADEE spacecraft will take 30 days to reach the moon because of its flight path.

LLCD will begin operations shortly after arrival into lunar orbit and continue for 30 days afterward.

LLCD’s main mission objective is to transmit hundreds of millions of bits of data per second from the moon to Earth.

This is equivalent to transmitting more than 100 HD television channels simultaneously.

LLCD receiving capability will also be tested as tens of millions of bits per second are sent from Earth to the spacecraft.

There is a primary ground terminal at Nasa’s White Sands Complex in New Mexico, to receive and transmit LLCD signals.

An MIT team designed, built, and tested the terminal. They also will be responsible for LLCD’s operation at that site.

There are two alternate sites, one located at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, which is for receiving only.

The other is being provided by the European Space Agency on the Spanish island of Tenerife, off the coast of Africa.

It will have two-way communication capability with LLCD.

'Having several sites gives us alternatives which greatly reduces the possibility of interference from clouds,' said Cornwell. 

Nasa engineers believe this technology is even more exciting for communications beyond Earth’s orbit.

In the past, Nasa has experimented with sending low amounts of individual pulses to cameras on far-away space probes near Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury.

Recently, an image of Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, the Mona Lisa, was transmitted to Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft orbiting the moon.

‘But this was done at only hundreds of data bits per second,’ said Cornwell.

‘LLCD will be the first dedicated optical communication system and will send data millions of times faster.’
