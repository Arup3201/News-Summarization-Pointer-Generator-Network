Phillip Schofield confessed he had bought alcohol-filled advent calendars, but Christian groups failed to find his choice of gifts  amusing

It was for Phillip Schofield a fun festive gesture.

Confessing he had recently purchased three advent calendars filled with miniature bottles of alcohol, he jokily added: 'I have some friends who appreciate the wonders and diversity of alcohol.'

Unfortunately for the popular TV presenter, 52, Christian groups yesterday failed to find his choice of gifts quite as amusing.

To them the calendars, which feature a tipple behind every window, are silly gimmicks, which distract from the meaning of Christmas.

The advent period, which begins on December 1 and is seen as the countdown to Christmas, is marked with candles or calendars which relate to the Christmas story. Sometimes there are chocolates behind each daily window.

Now shoppers can pick up advent calendars with a range of treats hidden away, including alcohol.

Stocked in high-end department stores and online, the calendars feature 24 miniature bottles of spirits.

Harvey Nichols, Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason all sell 'Drinks By The Dram' advent calendars made by the alcohol company Masters of Malt.

There is also a whisky one, a gin one – nicknamed 'ginvent' – and also rum or cognac-based calendars, with prices ranging from £132.50 to £175.

The company also offers a tequila calendar, which is available online for around £150. A premium whisky calendar costs £279.95 on the brand's website.

Schofield, who has two daughters with his wife Stephanie Lowe and is co-host of ITV show This Morning, revealed his choice of gifts in an interview with Waitrose Weekend in which he said: 'Three little advent calendars. 

In one, behind every window there's a little bottle of tequila – all different kinds. For two other friends, I've got calendars with miniatures of different gins. I have some friends who appreciate the wonders and diversity of alcohol.'

Reacting to his comments, David Marshall, whose company The Meaningful Chocolate Company claims to sell the UK's only Fairtrade, charitable and Christmas story-telling advent calendar, said: 'We all like a tipple at Christmas but a bottle of booze everyday seems to be far away from the spirit and the meaning of Christmas.

'Advent is a time of preparation for Christmas and to replace that preparation with mini bottles of booze seems to be taking a step away from what most people would call the true meaning of Christmas.'

Stephen Green, a spokesman for the organisation Christian Voice, said: 'Advent is not a time for feasting, it's a time for reflection and waiting. The time for feasting is Christmas Day. 

'People need to think, is Christmas really all about drinking and living it up, or is it about reflecting on the fact that God became man in Jesus Christ, who was born as a baby in a manger. 

'That's really what it is, that God became one of us in Jesus Christ, we can do without the silliness of alcohol in advent calendars.'

The Methodist Church, which only serves non-alcoholic wine at Holy Communion – the ceremony where churchgoers traditionally take a sip of wine – agreed. A spokesman said: 'Christmas is about celebrating the birth of Christ. It's when people come together to worship, praise and remember the birth of Jesus.'
