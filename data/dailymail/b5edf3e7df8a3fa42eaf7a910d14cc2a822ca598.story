It has been sung by football fans across Britain for decades.

Now, the answer to the mocking chant 'Who ate all the pies?' has been revealed.

Southampton supporters' eating habits have seen a whopping 310,000 pies bought at the Tesco store nearest to St Mary's Stadium every year.

They ate all the pies: Shoppers in Southampton buy an average of two pies each per visit to the Tesco store

Shoppers purchase an average of two pies each per visit - with the favourite being steak and chicken tikka, according to new figures.

It is the highest number of pies a year sold in any Tesco near a Premier League ground in the UK - and twice as many as those purchased near St James's Park in Newcastle.

Leicester City fans were revealed as the second most likely to devour pies during football matches, with shoppers buying 270,000 every 12 months from the store nearest to King Power Stadium.

Unlike those favoured by Southampton supporters, their top filling was steak and kidney.

West Bromwich Albion were named as third (200,000 purchases near The Hawthorns), Swansea City as fourth (190,000 near Liberty Stadium) and Burnley as fifth (165,000 near Turf Moor).

Meanwhile, Crystal Palace supporters were revealed as the least likely to fill up on pies as they watch their team take to the pitch.

Shoppers purchase an average of just 30,000 pies a year from the Tesco nearest to Selhurst Park, according to the figures obtained by the Daily Mirror.

Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea were also ranked among the bottom of the league, buying only 55,000 and 50,000 pies per year respectively.

Speaking of Southampton fans' taste for pies, Tesco buyer, Tom Nicolson, said: 'It provides a definitive answer to the age-old chant: "who ate all the pies?".'

The famous song is chanted from football terraces at anyone with a less than Twiggy-like figure.

In the past, this has included former Newcastle United frontman Mickey Quinn, who took the phrase 'Who ate 
all the pies?' as the title of his autobiography.

It is believed to have first been sung in 1894 by Sheffield United supporters at the club's goalkeeper William 'Fatty' Foulke, who weighed more than 300lb.
