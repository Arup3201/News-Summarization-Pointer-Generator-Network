It was the beginning of April and Everton, riding on the crest of a wave after a run of victories, were preparing for their biggest challenge of the season.

Arsenal were due in town and as Roberto Martinez spoke about the problems he anticipated from the side who were going head-to-head for the final Champions League place, the conversation slowly turned to Arsene Wenger and managerial longevity.

Wenger was in the middle of arguably the most testing spell of his tenure, while Martinez was being feted for transforming Everton’s fortunes. Having been linked with a number of positions, Martinez was asked how it felt to see his stock rise so much and whether that made him feel secure.

His reply was laced with realism.

‘If I could control it I would love to start a project and develop it until you see you can’t take it any further,’ said Martinez. ‘Unfortunately in the modern game you can’t talk about that. You’ve seen Sir Alex Ferguson have 27 years and Arsene Wenger but you don’t see that sort of profile.

‘I think (that profile) is the success model in the game (but) there are too many influences nowadays. You’re always three defeats away from a sacking. In the modern game you would love to say if you do well you want to stay here as long as you can but you don’t know what is happening.’

For all that Martinez was being pragmatic, the reality was different. If he was to lose three games on the spin, his theory would not be tested as Bill Kenwright wouldn’t contemplate jettisoning him; Everton’s chairman and the board of directors know they have an impressive figure at the helm.

It is why, in what promises to be a summer of new deals at Goodison Park, Martinez was handed new, lucrative terms after leading Everton back into Europe with a club Premier League record of 72 points on the back of some outstanding displays, such as the 3-0 dismantling of Arsenal.

‘Roberto undertakes his business with great style, confidence, positivity and class,’ said Kenwright, when announcing Martinez’s new five-year contract. ‘He is an Everton man. There is no magical ingredient to what we do at Everton.

‘We are a football club and recognise the fundamental importance of our manager.  When we find our man, we empower him. We support and provide him with everything at our disposal. We commit to our managers, and we’re immensely pleased that Roberto has committed to us.’

As Kenwight explained, taking over from David Moyes was not easy but Martinez’s relentless positivity, his unfailing optimism and unshakable belief in his methods have catapulted Everton forward and will be crucial in maintaining progress.

Some would accuse Martinez of naivety in thinking Everton will be able to keep their place in the top five but he, for instance, would look at Chelsea spending £160million on new midfielders over the past 12 months and relish the challenge of trying to find a way to beat them.

That, of course, is admirable but Martinez will know those who asked questions of him when he was appointed 53 weeks ago will do so again ahead of the new campaign: how will they juggle the demands of Europe? What if his movement in the transfer market is not as successful?

What Martinez has in his favour, though, is the unshakable backing of his chairman. Kenwright absolutely made the right decision to appoint Martinez, who describes his support as 'incredible' and he made the right decision once again to reward his outstanding first 12 months.

Big questions: Can Martinez do the same brilliant business that brought Lukaku to Goodison Park on loan?

At home: Ideally, Martinez wants to see his vision through from start to finish, and at Everton he may get the rare chance to do that

A number of clubs, including Tottenham, would have liked to have taken Martinez away from Goodison but he has a vision for Everton – some of his plans include building living quarters at the club’s Finch Farm training enclave – and, crucially, a board that want him to see it through.

‘We want the best because only the best will do,’ said Kenwright. ‘Unswervingly, we trust Roberto Martinez to take our club forward.  To use one of his favourite words we are “excited” about our future.’

Martinez may be right in pointing out that the world football managers now inhabit is trigger-happy and can be horribly insecure but Everton are an exception to the rule. Kenwright wants Martinez to turn supporters’ dreams into reality. Quite simply, he will be able to stay as long as he wants.
