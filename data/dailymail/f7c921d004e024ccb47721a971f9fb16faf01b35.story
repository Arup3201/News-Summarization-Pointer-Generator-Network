When their women's 4 x 100m freestyle relay team swam to gold on the opening night of the London Olympics, millions of Australians thought the sleep deprivation necessary to watch the Games would be worth it.

And though that tally wasn't immediately built upon, they could still delight in a barren start for the Brits on their home turf.

The Sydney Telegraph took great pleasure on the fourth day of competition in pointing out that Kazakhstan had three more gold medals than the hosts - 'Go Team Borat!' they screamed.

The whole of Australia looked forward to the inevitable avalanche of precious metal.

Tom Slingsby won Australia's second gold medal of the Olympics in the men's laser class sailing today, 11 days after the first

It all started so well for the Aussies when (left to right) Melanie Schlanger, Alicia Coutts, Brittany Elmslie and Cate Campbell took gold in the women's 4 x 100m freestyle relay on Day One

But their mickey-taking has backfired in spectacular fashion - sure, Tom Slingsby took gold in the sailing laser class at Weymouth today but the Aussies' total after 10 days of the Olympics still stands at a measly two gold medals.

And it is worth pointing out now that this is less than Kazakhstan - and Belarus, Cuba, Romania and 20 other nations. Great Britain, by contrast, has 16 golds and third place in the standings.

While Team GB has seen a gold rush just about every day, Australia is currently averaging one medal every six.

Long before the closing ceremony, the Olympic authorities, press and bleary-eyed armchair pundits Down Under have already accepted that its athletes have put on their worst performance in 36 years.

At the Montreal Olympics in 1976, they failed to win a single gold but the impressive hauls in every Games from Barcelona 1992 onwards made Australia an Olympic superpower.

But even the most patriotic fan would struggle to convince anyone that Australia are having a good Olympics, despite 12 silvers and seven bronzes.

The fact this is the first Olympics 
reported second-by-second on Twitter and other social media isn't 
helping the Australian mood. Brits joked over the weekend about 'Aussie 
Thumb' - a condition caused by scrolling down the medal table.

Other tweeters pointed out that if Yorkshire was a country, it would have more gold to cheer than Australia.

Nothing
epitomised the hurt more than Australian long jumper Mitchell Watt, who
was the favourite, coming second to Britain’s Greg Rutherford on 
Saturday night.

Referring
to that event, one newspaper suggested that if a book was ever written 
about Australia at the London Olympics it could be called Second to a Brit.

Even the men's hockey team - ranked number one in the world - chucked away a three-goal lead against GB yesterday.

But it isn't just the Poms dishing out the punishment. The Aussie Olympics have been in free-fall ever since pre-race favourite James Magnussen was pipped to gold by the American Adrian Nathan in the 100m freestyle swimming final by 0.01 seconds.

Magnussen was ashen-faced afterwards 
and his night didn't get any better when Australia finished fourth and 
outside the medals in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay.

The
losses came as a shock to an Aussie public well used to seeing the 
likes of Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett dominating in the pool.

The Sydney Morning Herald described the
Superman of the pool as facing his kryptonite after he failed to win any golds.

And their relay triumph aside, London has also brought heartbreak for two female swimmers - Stephanie Rice and Emily Seebohm - who were considered dead certs for gold, at least in Australia.

Rice 
failed to medal at all in the 200m and 400m Individual Relay finals and 
said she was considering calling time on her career, while Seebohm 
claimed social media had made her complacent after taking silver in the 
100m backstroke.

The
debate that followed Australia's failure in the pool was quickly 
magnified and applied to the other sports as the expected golds failed 
to materialise.

In
a front page story, Australia's swimming boss Leigh Nugent blamed the 
nation's 'easy life' society and small population for the results. 'We 
live in a society where people look for the easy way,' he said.

On a higher level,
Australian Olympic chef de mission Nick Green said that while silver was not a
dirty word, there would be a post mortem on what had gone with the team’s
performance.

The inquest will have to include rowing, beach volleyball and track cycling. In the latter, Britain dominated as Australia foundered.

The so-called 'Ashes on Wheels' went decisively in Britain's favour - almost a series whitewash.

And it got worse on Monday night as Shane Perkins could only manage bronze in the men's sprint.

Finger are being pointed in all directions. Some, including Kevan Gosper, Australia's senior member of the IOC, blame the Government for slashing funding for sport. 'The money is the difference between silver and gold,' he said.

But Slingsby's gold will offer a brief respite from the recriminations. The world champion held off a strong challenge from the Cypriot Pavlos Kontides in today's medal race at Weymouth.

The Australian, 27, kept his rival behind him at the back of field to take overall victory.

'Words just can't describe how I feel now,' Slingsby said. 'It's been a long road and I've been through the highs and lows of this sport but nothing beats this.

'I've worked so hard. The Olympics is the dream, the pinnacle of the sport and right now I'm the happiest guy on the planet, I can guarantee it.'

He may have realised his dream but there's no escaping the fact that the Olympics has been a nightmare for the Australian team.
