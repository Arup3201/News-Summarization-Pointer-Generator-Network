A baby girl has undergone a life-saving procedure while still partially inside her mother's womb.

Doctors feared a rare condition meant Sienna Smith would not be able to breathe when she was born, so conducted the emergency procedure before her birth.

A team of 20 medics were involved in the two-hour operation.

Sienna Smith (pictured with her parents, Sarah-Jane Harrup and Deryck Smith) had to have a life-saving procedure before she was born because a swelling on her neck could have prevented her breathing

First, they performed a Caesarean 
section and then inserted a breathing tube before the umbilical cord was
 cut and Sienna was fully removed from the womb.

Her parents, Sarah-Jane Harrup and Deryck Smith from Leicestershire, were warned their baby might not survive.

Planning for the operation began after a swelling was spotted on Sienna's neck at a 20-week scan.

It was pressing on her windpipe and doctors knew if the swelling was a tumour it could prevent Sienna breathing when she was born.

The operation was conducted by ear, nose and throat surgeon Javed Uddin who had never attempted it before.

Dr Uddin said: ‘If she was born naturally, there was a high chance she would not be able to breathe and we would not be able to help her.

Surgeons carried out a Caesarean section, but before Sienna was fully removed from the womb, they inserted a tube to allow her to breathe when the umbilical cord was cut

After Sienna's birth, the swelling in her neck subsided, allowing her to breathe normally

‘We knew something in her neck was pressing on her windpipe and we needed to plan her delivery very carefully.’

Mr Uddin and his colleagues decided Sienna's best chance was to have an Exit - ex utero intrapartum - procedure to insert a breathing tube while she was still connected to the umbilical cord.

They wanted to leave Sienna in the womb for as long as possible, but not so long she might be born naturally. As a result, they decided to go ahead with the operation at 37 weeks.

After opening Ms Harrup’s stomach, they lifted Sienna's head so a tube could be inserted into her throat.

It was vital to keep her attached to the umbilical cord to maintain her oxygen supply.

Doctors feared Sienna's neck swelling might be caused by a tumour, but further tests after her birth revealed the cause to be related to a thyroid problem

Mr Uddin said: ‘It is a very rare condition and we prepared for every eventuality, including her not surviving.

‘In the past, babies with conditions such as this would have died, but due to advances in technology we can spot problems early.’

As soon as the tube was inserted, the swelling which had been compressing Sienna's windpipe subsided, allowing her to breathe normally.

Mr Uddin, who performed the operation, said: 'The best thing was seeing Sienna in her mum's arms after the operation'

On further investigation, the swelling turned out not to be a tumour but a goitre, an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland.

Mr Uddin said: ‘I'm really pleased to have completed the first operation of its kind here.

‘The best thing was seeing the baby in her mum's arms after the operation.’

Sienna was born on April 16, weighing 5lb 6oz.

Ms Harrup, 30, said: ‘We are so grateful to Mr Uddin.

‘We cannot thank everyone enough for our beautiful daughter.

‘At first, Deryck and I were told if the lump was affecting Sienna's airways there would be nothing they could do if they couldn't get a tube in to let her breathe when she was born. Then we would have to let her go. I was so scared.

‘The operation had never been done before and we and the doctors just did not know what they would find.

‘Sienna has to take medication but she has reached all her milestones and is doing everything she should.

‘She is trying to crawl and loves doing actions to songs as well as playing with her toys.’
