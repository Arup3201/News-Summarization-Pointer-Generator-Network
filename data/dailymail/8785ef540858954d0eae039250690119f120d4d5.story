Hero: Jack Cornwell was 15 when he enlisted in the navy to fight the Germans in 1916

The last man standing on the deck of HMS Chester as his comrades were shot down in the greatest naval battle of the First World War, Jack Cornwell was harbouring a secret.

A besotted patriot, dazzled by his father and older brother in the Navy, he had been desperate to fight for his country when a state of war was declared in 1914.

Aged just 13, that was not an option.

But Jack would not take no for an answer.

In 1915, without telling his father Eli, the mature-looking newspaper delivery boy from east London fashioned himself as a fresh-faced 17-year-old and stood up to serve.

It was two years later that the true nature of his valour and courage was revealed.

He was shot in the chest in the Battle of Jutland, and when he was brought back to be treated in an English hospital, nurses realised his age.

Now, 97 years later, a letter from King George VI to Jack's mother, Lily, has emerged, commending her son for his service, and awarding him the Victoria Cross.

The official document informed Lily Cornwell that her 16-year-old son 
Jack was to be posthumously awarded the highest decoration for valour 
for his heroics in World War I, and invited her to receive it at Buckingham Palace.

To this day, he remains the third youngest recipient of the medal.

The announcement of Jack’s VC appeared in the London Gazette.

It stated:
 'The King has been graciously pleased to approve the grant of the 
Victoria Cross to Boy, First Class, John Travers Cornwell for the 
conspicuous act of bravery.

'Mortally wounded early in the action, 
Boy, First Class, John Travers Cornwell remained standing alone at a 
most exposed post, quietly awaiting orders, until the end of the action,
 with the gun’s crew dead and wounded all round him. His age was under 
sixteen and a half years.'

The teenager had lied about his age to join the Royal Navy at 15 so he could serve along with his father and elder brother in the war effort.

After completing his basic training he was assigned to HMS Chester as a gun sight setter and 
on May 31, 1916 the ship was on scouting duties at Jutland when it came 
under attack by four German cruisers.

Chester was hit by 18 150mm shells.

Although
 the ship was never in danger of sinking, the scene on deck was one of 
horror as many of the gun crews had lost lower limbs in the bombardment.

Despite all his comrades on the gun being killed and having been hit in the chest by shrapnel, Jack remained stood alone at his post until the end of the action.

He was later transferred to hospital in England but he died from the severe chest injuries he had sustained before his mother could arrive.

Deadly: The Battle of Jutland was deemed the most crucial naval battle of the First World War

In all, 29 men on HMS Chester were killed in the action, mostly gun operators who lost their legs as the open-backed gun-shields did not reach the deck to give protection.

Jack’s mother received the VC from the King on November 16, 1916.

The framed Admiralty letter is owned by a private collector who is now selling it next month with a pre-sale estimate of £1,000.

Matthew Tredwen, of Kent based C&T Auctioneers, said: 'Boy Cornwell’s Victoria Cross is one of the most famous because of his age.

'He was the last man, or in this case boy, left standing on the gun while everyone around him was killed.

'He was mortally wounded and for someone of 16 to carry on with his duty in those circumstances is remarkable.

'When his grieving mother received this letter telling her her late son was to be awarded the VC it must have been a proud moment for her during a terrible time.'
