Shoppers are bypassing the display windows and bee lining for the beach this may, as unseasonably mild weather dampens retailer's winter spirits.

Major retail chains, including Myer, are meeting this week to discuss when to start moving an over supply of winter stock at reduced prices, as consumers opt to ditch the winter woolies in favour of shorts and shirts.

In the past three years, the end of financial year discounts has started on June 1. But with weather records continuing to be beaten across the eastern seaboard, sales signs are already popping up in shop windows.

Early sales: The pressure is on for major retailers which are being forced to bring forward the traditional winter sale periods

And it appears there is little let up in sight, with forecasters tipping at least another five days of above average temperatures for Sydney and Brisbane.

Sydney extended its record warm spell to a ninth day on Sunday, and for most of the coming week will have maximums of at least 23 degrees.

A top of 26 is predicted for Tuesday, which is well above the long-term average for May of 19.4 degrees.

In Brisbane, it's a similar scenario, as the continuation of warm days this week has Weather Zone meteorologist Drew Casper-Richardson predicting the hottest seven days for this time of year in Brisbane’s history.

Today will see a a top of 29 degrees Celsius for the Queensland capital, with maximums of 27 through to Thursday.

Retailers may also be forced to put an oversupply of winter stock on the clearance racks at budget prices

And while the spell of hot days continue, retail stores with a heavy reliance on clearing lots of winter stock are going into crisis mode.

A spokesperson for Myer told Fairfax Media that it will meet this week to discuss when to bring its sales period forward.

'There is nothing definite, but we will be discussing this at the directors' meeting,' the spokesperson said.

The chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, Russell Zimmerman, said the warm weather was wreaking havoc across the retail sector.

'This is having a huge impact on retail turnover, margins and stock holdings,' Mr Zimmerman said.

He said it's not just the thick winter woolies which aren't selling, but everything from boots, to kitchenware's such as soup makers and crockpots, manchester and bedding.

'Even if we get a sharp cold spell, most people will now wait for the sales to buy new items that they may only use for a couple of months.'

Crisis talks: Myer confirmed it is meeting this week to discuss when it will put its sales signs up in store, earlier than the traditional June 1 start of the sale period

Coupled with the pressure of internet shopping and new international fashion and homewares brands, It is not a good sign.

But a saving grace has been the booming residential sector, which has helped furniture and home-related sales.

And some food retailers, such as cafes and supermarkets, have also benefited by thee spell of warm weather as food courts expand their operations outdoors.

Mr Richardson said as long as the high-pressure keeps hovering above Sydney, the blue skies will remain.

“As long as we have a high-pressure system sitting over us, there's not much chance of rain,” Mr Casper-Richardson said.
