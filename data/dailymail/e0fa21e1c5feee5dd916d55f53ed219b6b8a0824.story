A family of four fell ‘horrifically’ ill during a Spanish summer holiday which left two young daughters in hospital, one in critical condition.

The Smith family, from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, travelled to the 3* Azuline, Coral Beach resort in Ibiza in June, but say the trip turned into every family’s ‘worst nightmare’ when all of them fell ill and two-year-old daughters Olivia and Hannah were hospitalised for days as they battled E.coli.

Dad, Stuart, who was made redundant on his return to work, was also diagnosed with having contracted the bacteria.

Nightmare: A holiday to Ibiza turned into disaster for the Smith family when they contracted E.Coli

Critical: Hannah spent 21 days in Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle and needed dialysis

The toddlers have now been diagnosed with haemolytic uraemia syndrome – a condition related to E.Coli which can cause kidney failure due to a breakdown of red blood cells – and distraught parents Stuart and Nicola have instructed expert international illness lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate what caused them to fall ill and to help secure their daughters funds for on-going treatment.

To make matters worse, Stuart was made redundant on his return from his job as a production worker in manufacturing, as he took time off to care for his daughters, which affected his redundancy score negatively.

The family
 arrived at the 3* Azuline resort, in the Playa Las Cana area of Ibiza on June 1 for an 11 day break,
 but within days all of them began suffering from symptoms of sickness, 
diarrhoea and stomach cramps.

Stuart,
 Olivia and Hannah were all diagnosed as suffering with E.coli 0157 on 
their return and the girls symptoms were so severe that they were 
admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle.

Olivia,
 who was two in July, was discharged after six days but Hannah, who 
turns three at the end of the month, spent 21 days in hospital and 
needed dialysis to help her kidneys function properly.

Stuart,
 38, said: 'The last few weeks have been like our worst nightmare coming
 to life as we have had to watch our little girls fight for their lives 
in hospital.

'The
 last thing we imagined was that we would all fall so horrifically ill. 
We did notice that some of the food that should have been chilled was 
left at room temperature and some of it was undercooked, but we tried to
 be as careful as possible.

'The
 worst thing now is not knowing whether the girls have been left with 
permanent kidney problems as a result. We just cannot believe how going 
on holiday has turned all of our lives upside down.

'I
 lost my job and Nicola is a housewife so on top of our worries about 
the girls, we are also concerned about what the future will hold for us 
financially.

It is a combination of anemia caused by the destruction of red blood cells, kidney failure and a low platelet count.

Acquired from contaminated food or water, the disease predominately affects children.

Has a 5%-10% mortality rate, with most recovering without major consequences.

However in the most serious of cases, dialysis and life-long renal replacement therapy may be needed to treat kidney disease.

'We
 just want answers about what caused the illness and to know that if 
hygiene failings are found, steps are taken to rectify them and prevent 
anyone else suffering in the same horrible way as we have.'

Clare 
Pearson, a specialist International Personal injury lawyer at Irwin 
Mitchell who has now contacted Jet2.com to notify the tour operator that
 legal action is being considered said: 'The Smith family suffered a 
horrible ordeal on their holiday which became so serious for Olivia and 
Hannah that they were admitted to hospital on their return to the UK 
because of the severity of their condition.

'The
 family will not know whether there has been any significant lasting 
damage caused until next year which will understandably be an agonising 
wait for them all.

'E.coli
 is a bacteria which can be contracted by eating contaminated food such 
as raw unwashed vegetables and undercooked meat, but following good food
 hygiene standards can prevent it from spreading.

'We
 are now investigating whether more could have been done to prevent the 
family from falling so ill and hope that Jet2.com will work with us 
quickly and amicably so we can complete out investigations for the 
family.'

Rooms at the Azuline resort, per person all inclusive, range from £33-£78 a night. The hotel also offers bed and breakfast and half-board options.
