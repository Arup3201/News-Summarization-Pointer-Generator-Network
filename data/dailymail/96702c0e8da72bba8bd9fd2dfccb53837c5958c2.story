Relatives and friends of a young man who fired shots in New Jersey's largest mall, trapping terrified shoppers for hours before killing himself, struggled Tuesday to reconcile those actions with a person they described as pleasant and well-liked.

As pictures of 20-year-old Richard Shoop at a friend's wedding emerged investigators said they don't believe the gunman intended to shoot anyone when he arrived at the Garden State Plaza in Paramus and began firing into the ceiling.

'He told me that he was going to get a new job at this TV place and he was going to make good money,' said his childhood friend Madison Barbarini who happily posed for pictures with Shoop on her happy day in May 2011.

'He told me that he was doing really well and it seemed like he was really happy. Things just don't add up. Why would he do this? It doesn't make sense.'

'He honestly wouldn't hurt a fly.'

News of Shoop's suicide stunned friends and relatives. However, investigators now believe Shoop intended 'suicide by cop'.

'We think he went in with the intent that he was not going to come out alive,' Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said.

The suspect's brother, Kevin Shoop, told reporters outside their home on a quiet suburban block in Teaneck that his brother was 'a great person' who was liked by friends and family and gave no advance warning about what he intended to do.

'He just sadly decided to make an act of — an act of, I guess, self-indulgence — by taking his own life publicly,' Kevin Shoop said. 'And it's a tragedy to us all. And we're going to now handle matters and deal with them.'

Dod Geges, the owner of a pizzeria in Teaneck where Shoop worked for several years, said Shoop didn't show violent tendencies and 'was always sad' when he heard about shootings on TV.

Shoop left an ambiguous note with his family that raised concern, however. Molinelli, the prosecutor, would not call it a suicide note, but he said it did 'express that an end is coming. It could have been prison. ... It could have been what he did last night. It gave his family reason to reach out to us.'

Mall gunman Richard Shoop was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound

Response: Heavily-armed police are pictured outside the Garden State Plaza mall where gunman Richard Shoop's body was discovered in a part of the building still under construction

Hunt: Law enforcement officials gather outside the New Jersey mall. The gunman entered the building at around 9.30pm on Monday and reportedly strolled casually through shops firing bullets into the air

Governor Chris Christie called the shooting a wake-up call for lawmakers to focus on mental health issues as part of a comprehensive effort to reduce gun violence.

'Obviously that young man went there to end his own life. We may not be that lucky next time,' Christie said. 'We need to get to the root causes of what drives a young man like that to drive to Garden State Plaza in that condition.'

It is not known whether Shoop had any mental health problems. Authorities said he had a known drug problem.

Chaos erupted shortly before the mall's 9:30 p.m. closing time Monday when authorities said a man dressed in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet fired six shots.

Molinelli said the gun, which was modified to look like an AK-47 assault rifle, belonged to Richard Shoop's brother, who owned it legally and did not give the shooter permission to take it.

At the mall Monday night, witnesses said the sound of gunfire sent customers and employees rushing hysterically for the exits and hiding places at the mall, which remained closed Tuesday.

Officials said the mall would reopen Wednesday morning.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers converged on the 2.2 million-square-foot mall, which was put on lockdown.

New Jersey State Police landed a helicopter in the parking lot and SWAT teams with dogs initially went through the mall and started evacuating people.

Shoop's body was discovered around 3:20 a.m. Tuesday in a back corridor, deep within a lower level of the mall in an area not accessible to the public, Paramus Police Chief Kenneth Ehrenberg said.
