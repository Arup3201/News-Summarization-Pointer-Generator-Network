The BBC has defended its World Cup coverage after a slew of complaints about pundits and commentary.

The corporation today acknowledged that some fans were unhappy after Phil Neville, Alan Shearer and commentator Jonathan Pearce were criticised online.

But it brushed off the complaints, insisting its team is 'very strong' and it will 'take time' for viewers to get used to them.

The BBC has defended its World Cup team after a barrage of criticism in the tournament's opening week

Former Everton player Phil Neville bore the brunt of heaviest criticism, with complaints about his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during England's opening game with Italy.

The BBC received more than 400 complaints about his performance, with even the corporation's own presenter Danny Baker suggesting producers made a mistake by letting him cover the game.

Viewers have also criticised Jonathan Pearce's commentary and said former Italian star Fabio Cannavaro and Brazilian Juninho, who have acted as pundits, are difficult to understand.

During France's match with Honduras, regular commentator Pearce appeared confused by a computer animation that first showed 'no goal' when the football hit the post, before changing to 'goal' when it crossed the line.

Regular pundit Alan Shearer has also been criticised on Twitter, with fans accusing him of 'stating the obvious' and 'being too negative'.

French star Thierry Henry has been one of the only successes of the tournament for the corporation, being praised by fans for both his fashion and insight.

Responding to critics, the BBC published a statement on its complaints website today, defending its choice of pundits and commentators

It said: 'The World Cup is watched by an audience of many millions with a hugely diverse range of tastes and opinions and we value feedback from our viewers and listeners.

'We believe we have put together a very strong international line-up, with a wealth of experience and knowledge covering all aspects of the game at the very highest level.

'Thoughts on individual presenters and commentators can vary considerably so it's inevitable some viewers or listeners will dislike or disapprove of certain presenters and commentators.

'All our programme contributors are appointed on the basis of their experience, knowledge and talent, but judgements are often subjective and we would never expect everyone to agree with every choice we make, and appreciate that sometimes it can take time for viewers and listeners to get used to a particular individual's style of presentation or commentary.'Â 

Former Brazil midfielder Juninho was among those singled out for a presenting style which bordered on the incomprehensible, and for a failure to understand his co-presenters' analysis
