'Maybe I can make a difference': Ellen Page came out as gay while speaking at the Human Rights Campaign's Time To THRIVE conference for LGBTQ youth in Las Vegas Friday

Breakout performance: Page shot to fame after starring in the lead role of the 2007 film Juno

'To help others have an easier and 
more hopeful time. Regardless, for me, I feel a personal obligation and a
 social responsibility.'

Time
 to THRIVE organiser Human Rights Campaign tweeted the news and wrote: 
'Congratulations, @EllenPage for taking the steps to live openly and 
come out as lesbian. #comingout #timetoTHRIVE (sic).'

Time to thrive: The 26-year-old starlet said she was 'sick of lying by omission' despite having been previously linked to Hollywood hunks Elijah Wood, Ben Foster, Sam Riley, Emile Hirsch, and Alexander Skarsgard

According to the Hollywood Reporter, she said: 'It's weird because here I am, an actress, representing - at least in some sense - an industry that places crushing standards on all of us.

'Not just young people, but everyone.
 Standards of beauty. Of a good life. Of success. Standards that, I hate
 to admit, have affected me.

'You
 have ideas planted in your head, thoughts you never had before, that 
tell you how you have to act, how you have to dress and who you have to 
be. I have been trying to push back, to be authentic, to follow my 
heart, but it can be hard.'
