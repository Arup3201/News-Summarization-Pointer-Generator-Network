BBC economics editor Robert Peston has received mixed reaction to his debut in the Newsnight presenting seat – after he failed to wear a tie for the appearance.

The 54-year-old journalist, who is set to host two more editions of the show this week, chose to go without a tie as he took up the seat formerly occupied by Jeremy Paxman.

It has sparked a string of comments on Twitter, with many calling for him to ‘buy a tie’ and smarten up.

Others also took to the social media site to point out his ‘uncanny’ resemblance to Doctor Who star David Tennant.

The 54-year-old journalist drew criticism from viewers for looking 'scruffy' while hosting current affairs show

Viewers took to Twitter to criticise Peston for not wearing a tie with some branding him 'scruffy'

Peston, who wore a purple striped shirt with his top button undone and a dark suit jacket, interviewed Isaac Herzog, the leader of Israeli Labor, the country's main opposition party, on his debut.

He looked fairly relaxed as he questioned Mr Herzog about the conflict in Gaza, and fiddled distractedly with a pen in one hand.

His interview with Andy Burnham on Labour's stance on privatisation and the NHS was fairly more animated – but viewers couldn’t help but notice his ‘scruffy’ appearance. Mr Burnham, in contrast, was wearing a tie.

Francis Ingham was one of several viewers to take to Twitter to share his opinion on Peston’s appearance.

Mr Ingham wrote: ‘@Peston opens #newsnight Blimey. He looks for an unemployed IT geek. #BuyATie.....’

Meanwhile, Yvonne Johnston said: ‘Where’s your tie, Robert? #newsnight’

And Angela Brownrigg wrote: ‘Are ties banned? Everyone looks so scruffy #newsnight’

Before later adding: ‘You did good, Robert. Now buy a tie. #newsnight’

Peston's failure to wear a tie was one of the main talking points among viewers who aired their views online

Unfortunately for Peston both his interviewees looked much smarter than him, with both opting to wear a tie.

Comments about Peston's lack of a tie also appeared to be endorsed by Newsnight editor Ian Katz.

He posted on his Twitter profile: 'Fortunately Andrew Foxall has brought enough tie to go round #newsnight'

He later retweeted a post which made reference to the guest host needing a shirt with a stronger collar.

The post said: '@Peston coped nicely, but needs a stronger collar stand if to go without a tie, especially if going to me (sic) moving around.'

As well as forgoing a tie, Peston also debuted a slightly longer hairstyle for the appearance – which was quickly picked up on by viewers.

Mark Pougatch said: ‘The wife & I agree: we both like the new barnet @Peston’

While Katharine SacksJones asked: ‘Has @Peston got new glasses? Is it just me or does he now bear an uncanny resemblance to David Tennant? #newsnight’

Despite comments about his appearance, many applauded him for his debut on the daily BBC2 current affairs programme.

While Paul Thomas ‏wrote: ‘Best #newsnight for a while. I liked @Peston and his understated approach. He wasn't rubbish!’
