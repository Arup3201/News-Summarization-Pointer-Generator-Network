Fiona Leonard, who was drunk at the time of the attack, has now been jailed for two years, three months

Dressed in her finery, Fiona Leonard 
had been looking forward to the highlight of her social calendar – 
Ladies’ Day at Royal Ascot.

The
 31-year-old insurance clerk joined a party of women for a chance to 
mingle with the fashionable and famous at an event attended by the 
Queen.

But instead of fond 
memories, Leonard was yesterday left shamed and beginning a prison 
sentence in the aftermath of a drunken assault in which she bit another 
woman’s face.

The savage unprovoked attack has left her victim, Carol 
McAndrew, 49, scarred for life.

A
 court heard how Leonard punched Mrs McAndrew to the floor and bit her 
on the cheek, removing a chunk of flesh and leaving her needing 15 
stitches.

This week a judge jailed Leonard for 27 months for the attack, which took place last June.

The
 thug, who is now 20 weeks pregnant, and her victim had been among a 
group of women from Birmingham who hired a coach to take them to the 
meeting at the Berkshire racecourse.

But Leonard failed to return to the coach promptly at the end of the day, causing the 130-mile journey home to be delayed.

Birmingham
 Crown Court heard that when Leonard did eventually appear, the coach 
set off but she became ‘aggressive and foul-mouthed’ and a row broke 
out.

Prosecutor Alexander Davies said that Leonard approached Mrs McAndrew and asked: ‘Have you got a problem with me?’

Mrs McAndrew decided to get off the bus early and phoned her husband to come and pick her up.

Leonard launched the attack after being 'aggressive and foul-mouthed' on the bus back to Birmingham from a day at the races, the court heard

However,
 Leonard followed her off the vehicle and attacked her on the pavement. 
‘The defendant grabbed her by her hair and punched her several times in 
the face,’ Mr Davies said.

‘She
 was knocked to the floor and the defendant was on top of her and bit 
her hard to the left side of her face.’ The bus driver had to drag 
Leonard off Mrs McAndrew and hold her until police arrived to arrest 
her.

Joseph Keating, 
defending Leonard, said: ‘She understands that her actions were 
completely out of all proportion in the circumstances.’

Leonard
 and her partner had planned to move to Ireland before their child was 
born, but this incident had ‘completely turned her life around’, he 
said.

She is now unemployed and living off financial support from family and friends.

Leonard,
 from Yardley, Birmingham, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
Passing sentence, Judge Peter Carr told her it was ‘plain from what 
happened that you had far too much to drink’.

He
 added: ‘You were late back to the coach. Once you were on it there is 
plain evidence that  you were aggressive towards Mrs McAndrew and 
foul-mouthed.

The attack happened after the women had been on a coach trip to Ladies Day at Ascot racecourse (file picture)

‘You were told
 to behave yourself but you did not heed the warning. The really vile 
aspect of this case is the fact that you bit her.’

Mrs
 McAndrew, from Solihull, West Midlands, said after the case: ‘I am 
absolutely devastated at what has happened. I had never met the girl 
before and things just got out of hand.’

Her husband Thomas, 53, added: ‘Carol is very upset about all this and had no intention of the woman going to prison.’
