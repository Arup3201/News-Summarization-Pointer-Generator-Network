Mike Ashley will not appear at Hampden on Tuesday after it was confirmed a hearing into alleged breaches of 'dual ownership' rules will take place by conference call.

It had been rumoured that the Newcastle United owner - who also holds an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers - had been called to appear before the Scottish Football Association's judicial panel.

Both the Ibrox club and Ashley were given notices of complaint alleging they had failed to 'act in the best interests' of football.

But the Scottish Football Association now say that Tuesday's meeting was only ever a 'procedural hearing'.

A conference call involving lawyers from the SFA, Rangers and Ashley's camp will take place to discuss a time-scale for the next hearing, when the Sports Direct tycoon will be expected to show.

That hearing is likely to be within the next two to four weeks.

Ashley signed an agreement with the SFA back in 2012 vowing not to buy up any more than 10 per cent of the Glasgow giants while he remained in charge at St James' Park.

Ashley was prevented from raising his holding in the club to up to 30% in December

Hampden chiefs blocked him from increasing his stake to just under 30 per cent last month.

But he has been able to take virtual command of the club after handing the Rangers board a £3million emergency loan before placing associates Derek Llambias and Barry Leach onto the Ibrox board.

He is now expected to hand the cash-strapped club a further £10million loan ahead of Thursday, when wage payments are due to be made.
