Roy Hodgson has labelled Jack Colback as the 'ginger Pirlo' after calling the Newcastle midfielder up to the England squad. 

The 24-year-old will enjoy his first taste of international football after impressing at the back end of last season with Sunderland before a controversial move to Tyneside. 

'Someone who knows him very well called Jack the "ginger Pirlo" - let's hope that becomes true,' said Hodgson, whose side face Norway and Switzerland next week.

Really? Roy Hodgson likened Colback to the mercurial midfielder Andrea Pirlo

Pirlo is, of course, one of the world's finest ball players and a nemesis of England in previous major tournaments. 

While the comment wasn't made with any level of expectation attached - harking back to Sportsmail's Adrian Durham's column about the youngster earlier this month - Hodgson has sparked anger among supporters online. 

One disgruntled fan said: 'If Jack Colback ever plays for England I'm moving country and supporting Costa Rica.'

Many vented on Twitter, but Colback's pass completion percentage was remarkably higher than that of the mercurial Italian last season. 

Pirlo did, however, create treble the chances while at Juventus and made more goals.

Durham said on August 18: 'Jack Colback is England class – his set-pieces are phenomenal. And he’s got bottle as well. 

'This kid isn’t stupid. He’s a Geordie who’s well aware of the passions on Tyneside and Wearside. These fans don’t hold back when it comes to rivalries. Even punching a horse isn’t off limits when it’s Newcastle vs Sunderland.

'So for a Newcastle fan to make the move from Sunderland to St James’ Park, and on a free transfer – well, you’ve got to admire Colback’s balls.

'And check out his Newcastle debut. Sure they lost, but you’ve got to have a small-minded football brain to think there were no positives for Alan Pardew after the match, and Colback was one of them.

'He’s the Ginger Pirlo, trusted with the set-pieces, and delivering good service with most of them. I like this kid, and I can’t help thinking that if he’d come through at Arsenal, Liverpool or even the 'boutique' academy at Southampton, Colback would have had an England call-up by now.' 

Meanwhile, Pirlo will miss the first month of the Serie A season because of a bruised right hip.

He was injured in a pre-season match and Juventus say he's pulled a tendon that requires 30 days to heal. He will miss italy's games next week and the old Lady's Champions League opener.
