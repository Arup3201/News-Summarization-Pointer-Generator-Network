Wembley chiefs have admitted they failed to lay the new Desso turf  properly before Sunday’s NFL game destroyed the playing surface.

England head coach Roy Hodgson is furious the pitch will not be in perfect condition when Wayne Rooney wins his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday. 

Hodgson is attempting to introduce a slick passing game to the team as England coast through the rest of their Euro 2016 qualifying.

The Wembley surface is visibly cut up as the NFL stars go through their paces on Sunday night

The Cowboys beat the Jaguars 31-17 in the second NFL game at Wembley in a fortnight ahead of England

More rain is forecast this week as the Wembley groundstaff work night and day to repair the damage caused by Sunday’s mudbath when Dallas Cowboys played Jacksonville Jaguars.

FA chiefs have since admitted the pitch will not be perfect on Saturday as they face Slovenia in front of 80,000 supporters.

Wembley managing director Roger Maslin said: ‘I’m disappointed the surface isn’t as good as it should be but I’m confident it will be back to its pristine state after a winter renovation.

‘This isn’t so much a problem of the NFL but of our summer renovation. Due to slightly too much topsoil during the summer there’s more marking and scarring than we’d want.

‘Roy is entitled to his opinion. While the pitch will not be of the very highest standard we want for the Slovenia game, it will still be a good playing surface. We do expect it to be back to its best by March for the Lithuania game.’

One man hoping the pitch won’t stop him shining is England new boy Saido Berahino.

The striker got a call up after seven goals for West Bromwich Albion and his club have told potential suitors that the 21-year-old is not for sale. 

With Tottenham and Liverpool both keen on a January move, chairman Jeremy Peace has issued a statement insisting Berahino will be at the club until at least next summer.

Contract talks with Berahino’s representatives have begun, with the focus on improving a deal which currently runs to 2017 to reflect his growing importance.

England manager Roy Hodgson was not at all pleased with the NFL match taking place at Wembley

It is believed he will be offered double his current £12,000-per-week salary, which was only signed last December. Before that, Berahino earned £850 per week.

Peace issued a hands-off warning to would-be suitors. ‘I wish to assure our supporters that Saido Berahino will not be going anywhere in January or, I hope, next summer,’ he said. ‘It is not in our minds at all to trade a footballer the club has worked to develop.

‘It (Berahino’s form) seems to have also generated unwarranted speculation about his future — which I wish to stress remains very firmly aligned to this club.’

Saido Berahino was handed a call-up by Hodgson and the West Bromwich Albion striker has raised eyebrows
