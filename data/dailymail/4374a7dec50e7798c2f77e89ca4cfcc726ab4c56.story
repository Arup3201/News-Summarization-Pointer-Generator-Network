Jeano Mouton faces a felony terroristic threat charge and is being held on $5,000 bond

Houston police arrested a Transportation Security Administration officer accused of threatening another Bush Intercontinental Airport employee.

On January 25, Jeno Mouton of Houston, Texas allegedly told his TSA supervisor that 'he would rather vent than come and shoot up the place' and that he repeated the security threat several times at the security checkpoint in the area of Terminal C.

KHOU reports that Mutoun's supervisor reported him to the human resources office manager and that Mouton was told to never return to Bush Intercontinental Airport or to any other TSA offices or places of work.

On January 29, Mouton was spotted by a TSA worker at the airport on the secure side in plain clothes.

Even though Mouton was on the secure side, his supervisors believe that he posed a threat because he was seen at the airport only a few days after he was asked to never return.

Mouton also has a current Texas concealed handgun license so his threat to 'shoot up the place' is not far-fetched.

Mouton was jailed with a $5,000 bond. he will return to court of March 7 where he faces a felony terroristic threat charge.

Mouton was asked to never return to work after threatening his supervisor but returned anyway, causing concern among fellow TSA employees

Mouton possesses a Texas concealed handgun license which would make it possible for him to 'shoot up the place'
