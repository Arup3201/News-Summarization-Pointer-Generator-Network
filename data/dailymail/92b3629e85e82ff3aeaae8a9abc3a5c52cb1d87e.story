A patient at a private hospital awoke after an operation to find a nurse lying on the floor having a drunken nap.

Nurse Janet Gill smelled strongly of alcohol and when the patient discovered her in his room at BMI The Duchy Hospital in Harrogate, Yorkshire.

Ms Gill, who has a previous alcohol-related dismissal from another hospital, also falsely recorded giving the patient his medication, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard today.

Misconduct: The Duchy Hospital in Harrogate where nurse Janet Gill was discovered slumped on the floor smelling of alcohol in a patients room

The male patient raised the alarm after finding Ms Gill slumped on the floor.

Ms Gill was told to ‘sleep it off’ by a senior nurse before driving home after the incident in March last year.

Helen Fleck, for the Nursing and Midwifery Council said: ‘Patient A was recovering from an operation overnight in the hospital.

‘He became aware during the night that somebody who appeared to be wearing a nurses uniform had entered his room, and appeared confused and didn’t know what she was doing.

‘She slumped down on the floor of the room and remained there. Obviously concerned by this, he pressed the patient alarm to alert other members of staff.

‘After investigating, the senior nurse noticed that Ms Gill smelt of stale alcohol and just didn’t seem with it.’

The patient complained to senior staff at the Duchy, who immediately checked his medication charts as a precaution.

They discovered Ms Gill had recorded giving the patient his prescribed medication, despite the drugs still being in his room unused.

Ms Fleck added: ‘The registrant remained on the premises that night because the senior nurse recommended she sleep off the alcohol before she drove home.’

Ms Gill admits to attending work under the influence of alcohol, being unfit to work and falling asleep while on duty but denies wrongdoing in regards to the false recording of the administering of medication to the patient.

Ms Gill had been disciplined by hospital bosses for a similar matter two years earlier, the hearing was told.

Ms Fleck said: ‘It became apparent that this was a registrant who had previously been reported for attending work under the influence of alcohol while working at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton.

‘This occurred on October 4 2009, and the registrant made full admissions and presented certain mitigating factors to explain her conduct.’

Gill, who could be struck off from the profession, is not attending the hearing, claiming the decision had already been made.

The hearing continues.
