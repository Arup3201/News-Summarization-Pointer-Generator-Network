Thousands of drivers were trapped since Thursday in a huge traffic jam on a major freeway connecting Moscow and St. Petersburg, caused by heavy snowfall.

At its worst point the line of trucks stretched 150 miles, starting in the Moscow region and ending in the Tver region.

The Emergencies ministry dispatched some 175 rescuers and 100 snow-clearing vehicles in response to the heavy snowfall on the M-10.

By early Monday morning local time, the traffic had recovered, authorities said adding that the vehicles are now moving at their normal speed, reports rt.com.

The ministry said authorities had provided trapped drivers with hot food, shelter, medical help and fuel.

But according to local media, which managed to speak to drivers, some of them had rather different experiences, saying that they didn't get any help.

Clearing: Around a hundred snow-clearing vehicles were deployed to get the roads moving

Fed up: Many drivers were critical of the reaction by emergency services

Delay: The site of the jam, which stretched from Moscow to Tver on the M-10 motorway

Though, other motorists reportedly saw rescuers handing out hot drinks and sandwiches near the city of Tver.

Some drivers were reported to have run out of fuel as they continued to run their engines for heat to endure the sub-zero conditions.

Russian roads are notoriously badly maintained and were neglected during the Soviet era, when infrastructure suffered at the expense of Cold War defence spending.
