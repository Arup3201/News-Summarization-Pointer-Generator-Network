Writing on their Facebook page, 470 Girls, they said: 'Back in Rio for 2 weeks training. Top News Today: We've been mugged.

'Our delightful walk back from the sailing club to the hotel turned fairly nasty when two guys wielding 7inch knives ran at us, pushed us around and grabbed everything we had.

The British sailing team broke the news of their terrifying ordeal to friends on Facebook

Rio will be the first South American city to host the Olympics and some have voiced concerns over safety

'Along with the things that were actually worth something, the most annoying thing right now is our lycra we were sailing in got taken. Unbelievable!!

'Anyway, we made it back to the hotel slightly shaken but all okay.'

 Rio will be the first South American city to host the Olympics but there are concerns over safety and the suitability of sailing conditions, with many sailors describing the water as filthy.
