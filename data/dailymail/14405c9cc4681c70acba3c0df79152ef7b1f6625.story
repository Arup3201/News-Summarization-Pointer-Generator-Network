If there was ever a timepiece that would silence the boasts of smug smartwatch wearers, then this would be it.

The magnificent Complication Poétique Midnight Planétarium lets you tell the time by placing a microcosm of the solar system on your wrist.

The intricate watch incorporates Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn — all the planets visible to the naked eye.

Instead of hands denoting the hours and minutes, planets rotate around a tiny rose gold sun in real-time.

Mercury will make a lap around the watch's face in just 88 days, Venus will require 224, and Earth of does it in one year.

Saturn, which is the farthest planet from the sun in the watch, won't make it back to its starting position for 29.5 years. A shooting star on the outer edge of the watch face indicates the time.

A rotating rose gold outer rim lets the 
wearer choose a special day on which the Earth will move under the star 
engraved in the sapphire crystal.

Inspired by planetariums, the movement of the watch was created for Van Cleef & Arpels' by Dutch watchmaker Christiaan van der Klaauw.

The discs are made of aventurine, and each planet is a semiprecious stone.

Mercury is serpentine, Saturn is sugilite, Venus is chloromelanite, Earth is turquoise, Mars is red jasper and Jupiter is blue agate.

With all those gemstones, and 396 working parts, it comes with a hefty price tag of £185,800.

A version with diamond decorations costs £247,700.
