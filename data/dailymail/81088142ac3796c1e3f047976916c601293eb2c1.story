The likes of Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Anne Hathaway and Mila Kunis may be huge Hollywood stars now, but at one point they would have all been struggling actors hoping to get their big break.

And for many young actors a job in an advertisement was the best way to make a quick buck whilst they waited for Spielberg to call.

Not all jobs in advertising were hugely glamorous, but you've got to pay the rent some how, right?  

We take a look at the commercials the stars might rather forget...

Mark Ruffalo was in a Clearasil advert for facial pads in 1989 as a fresh-faced 22-year-old

Mark Ruffalo 

Once upon a time, 13 Going on 30 and Shutter Island actor Mark Ruffalo, now 47, played a spotty teen (he was really 22 at the time) running around the streets in a leopard print waistcoat  for Clearasil in 1989.

Sporting a curly mop, the 'acne-prone' Ruffalo is distressed with his complexion, and is shown solemnly smearing the Clearasil pads on his face with a deadpan expression. 

In the next shot, he is back to wreaking havoc on the streets with a cheesy grin. 

Anne Hathaway

32-year-old brunette beauty Anne Hathaway may have won an Oscar for her role in Les Misérables, but before Hollywood blockbusters were a regular part of her schedule she was starring in  adverts for regional phone company, Cincinatti Bell.

Mid-Nineties Hathaway is seen cringing after a date as she calls her friend on a multi-line phone, while her onscreen mother natters away on another line.

In case you were wondering, her 'date' does eventually call.

This awkward date advert would have come about 15 years before Anne's Oscar success

Leonardo DiCaprio 

It might be impossible to imagine the established 40-year-old actor as anything but one of the Hollywood greats, but The Wolf Of Wall Street star used to make his money in bubblegum adverts. 

With a high-pitched voice, bouncy curtains and a goofy checkered blazer, little 14-year-old Leo is seen popping gum and rocking out in front of a large hi-fi system.

Naomi Watts 

Almost unrecognisable sporting an uncontrollable perm, the Mulholland Drive and King Kong actress Naomi Watts starred in an Australian advert for Tampax tampons in the Eighties. 

She awkwardly deals with an array of puberty difficulties: her bothersome younger brother, her irritated complexion, but according to the advert, one thing that doesn't bother her is her 'time of month'.

Naomi would have been about 16 at the time that this advert came out. Cue tons of cheesy grins and wide collar suits from a now 46-year-old Naomi Watts.

Brad Pitt 

Before he became a hot commodity in Hollywood and one half of the power couple that is 'Brangelina', Brad Pitt, now 51, was out patrolling the streets looking for Pringle-popping ladies to impress, or so this commercial shows.

Brad sports a golden tan and cavorts with his 'jock' friends in a yellow convertible; he would have been about 25 years of age. With no dialogue, Brad can only showcase his acting prowess by munching the crisps in a ecstatic manner.

The famous Hollywood actor would have been just 25-years-old at the time and still trying to catch his lucky break

Sarah Michelle Gellar 

She may be widely recognised as stake-toting high-kicking Buffy the vampire slayer, but 38-year-old Sarah Michelle Gellar started her career as a child actor, and starred in Burger King's first ever televised advert in 1981.

Pictured in sweet lavender dungarees and ribbon-held bunches, four-year-old Gellar sits on a picnic bench in an idyllic town and weighs up Burger King's benefits against McDonald's disadvantages.

In a endearing voice she pips: 'I go to Burger King!'

Bryan Cranston 

Considering his now-legendary  status following a starring role in Breaking Bad (he counts stars like Rihanna and Keith Richards as fans), Bryan Cranston's Eighties hemorrhoids advert is certainly one of the most embarrassing.

Cranston, now 59, walks up to the camera in a retro suit and holds up a tub of hemorrhoid cream, raving about 'hemorrhoidal tissue' and the cream's beneficial qualities.

In the early 1980s Bryan Cranston starred in a commercial for a hemorrhoid cream Preparation H  around 25 years or so before Breaking Bad success

Demi Moore 

Before 52-year-old Ghost actress Demi Moore had the Hollywood body everyone aspired to achieve, she starred as a less polished youth in sultry Coca Cola adverts.

With soft jazz music playing, a shoulder-padded Demi has an almost fatal incident with a Diet Coke can, but which ultimately leads her to meeting a handsome gentleman. 

Demi would have been about 26 years old at the time.

Ben Affleck 

Now a  twice Oscar-winning actor/director, 42-year-old Ben Affleck has certainly come a long way since his fast-food days.

The advert shows Affleck sporting a bouncy quiff, bomber jacket and bleached denim, patrolling the streets in a car with a vintage in-built phone. The actor would have only been about 17 at the time.

A few cheesy hair-grooming moments and a case of mistaken identity later and he's picking up a Burger King Chef Salad for his female interest. But before long is  called home by his dad for his curfew. Embarassing.

In 1989 Ben Affleck was in a Burger King commercial. He would have been about 17 at the time

Bruce Willis 

It's hard to imagine 60-year-old Die Hard actor Bruce Willis shimmying down the street in a white baggy suit with three supermodels, but in the late Nineties his advert for Seagram's Wine Coolers tells a different story.

The actor would have been around 32 years of age and is pictured playfully skipping and twirling with the ladies. He is eventually seen sporting a sleeveless t-shirt and enthusiastically playing the harmonica.  

Before his action-packed glory days, Bruce Willis made his name in an advert for Seagram's Wine Coolers in 1987. This was about a year before he appeared in his career-making lead role in Die Hard

Mila Kunis 

Four years before Mila Kunis, now 31, got her big break in  sitcom That '70s Show, and several years before she was crowned FHM's Sexiest Woman Alive, she was just another girl who liked to play with dolls - and starred in an advert for Glitter Hair Barbie in 1994.

11-year-old Mila is seen fresh-faced with a plait in her long hair, sporting a pink turtleneck and excitedly gazing at the doll that can have glitter combed into its locks.
