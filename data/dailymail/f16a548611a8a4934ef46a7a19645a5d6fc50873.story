Police are hunting for the joyriders of a milk float which was stolen and dumped in a lane, left balancing precariously over a ditch.

The truck, which has a top speed of 15mph, was stolen from the Dairy Crest depot in Shaw Heath, Stockport, in the early hours of yesterday morning and found abandoned two miles away in Tenement Lane, Bramhall with some of its windows smashed.

There had been no milk on the back of the Ford Transit float which was being kept in the depot with dozens of other milk floats.

Police forensic teams are now examining the vehicle after it was found at 7.10am yesterday morning. 

The vehicle’s ignition had been tampered with.

Local photographer Andrea Smith noticed the milk float and took some photographs.

She said: ‘I had been for my morning run and spotted it on Tenement Lane.

‘There was a policeman there who said he was waiting for the recovery vehicle so that no one would come back and torch it.’

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman confirmed that officers were called to Tenement Lane on Thursday morning and found an abandoned milk float.

Charlie North, a spokeswoman for Dairy Crest, said: ‘We are aware of the situation and are currently working with police and local authorities to resolve the matter.’

Dairy Crest is one of the largest dairy companies in the British grocery sector and sells two billion litres (3.5 billion pints) of raw milk every year.
