Thieves have cut down and taken a Christmas tree planted in memory of an eight-year-old boy who drowned on holiday.

The heartless theft has distressed the parents of Jak Taylor who decided that the tree would be the best way of remembering their son because he loved the festive season.

Friends and relatives raised £350 to buy the fir tree, which was planted on the village green in Bilsthorpe, Nottingham, where he was from.

Parents Dave and Lisa Taylor are devastated after thieves hacked down a Christmas tree planted in memory of their son, Jak, who drowned in a hotel swimming pool in Mallorca in August 2002

Jak was eight years old when he was found dead in a hotel swimming pool in Mallorca, and the family have returned every Christmas to decorate and take pictures in front of the tree.

But all that remains now is a ragged stump, which left his mother Lisa Taylor speechless when she saw it.

Police are now hunting the people who stole the tree but his devastated mother has called on the thieves to hand themselves in.

‘My daughter Beth saw it on Facebook on Saturday morning. I just couldn’t believe it so we drove down there to have a look,' said the 40-year-old.

‘When we got there, I was speechless. I just didn’t know what to say. I called my mum. I first thought people had got it wrong as no one from the village could have done this.’

The idea for planting a Christmas tree in memory of Jak was suggested by the mother of one of his friends because of his love for Christmas.

Mrs Taylor added: ‘The first year so many people went down to see the tree people couldn’t get near to it.

‘When the lights on each year we go down as a family and take pictures.

‘It is always a difficult time of year for us, I hate Christmas now. If it hadn’t been for the girls I would have stopped celebrating Christmas.

‘I really hope whoever has done this is caught.’

The tree was planted by the parish council three years ago - before then, a fir was planted each year in memory of Jak and then taken down.

Chairman Andrea Swallow, 63, said: ‘We just can’t believe anyone would do this.

‘People have been so impressed by it this year because it has got a lot bigger.’

After hearing about the tree being stolen, Sue Massey from Arnold, Nottinghamshire, has offered for one of the trees in her garden to be planted instead.

It is expected the replacement tree will be planted on Saturday.

The tree is thought to have been stolen between 7pm last Friday, December 6, and 8am on Saturday, December 7.

Nottinghamshire Police have asked anyone with information to contact them or Crimestoppers.
