Newcastle United have completed a deal to bring Facundo Ferreyra on loan from Shakhtar with an option to make the switch permanent for £6.5m.

The Argentine striker will boost Alan Pardew's attacking options at St James' Park and comes after the 23-year-old refused to return to his parent club.

Ferreyra was one of six Shakhtar players along with Brazilians Douglas Costa, Fred, Dentinho, Alex Teixiera and Ismaily who failed to report back to Ukraine following a friendly against Lyon in France on Saturday due to the political unrest in Ukraine.

But the Toon have been keeping tabs on the Argentine for two years, with Ferreyra first alerting the Tyneside club while playing for Velez Sarsfield in his native league, scoring 16 goals in only 22 league starts in the 2012-13 season.

Shakhtar then paid £7.5m for the striker but he featured rarely, netting six goals from five league starts.

Ferreyra has yet to make a senior appearance at international level, having previously played for the Argentina Under 20 side.

Ferreyra becomes Pardew's seventh summer signing following the arrivals of Remy Cabella, Emmanuel Riviere, Siem de Jong, Daryl Janmaat, Ayoze Perez and Jack Colback.
