There are some animals you just wouldn't want to interrupt eating - and crocodiles are very high up on that list.

But one daring wildlife photographer decided to rick becoming dessert as he snapped pictured of more than 20 crocodiles feasting on a bloated hippo carcass.

Californian Jeff Nadler stood just a few feet away from the water's edge to allow him to take these striking close-up images of the huge predators tearing into the three-tonne giant in South Luangwa, Zambia.

Deadly: Several crocodiles circle the three-tonne hippo carcass in South Luangwa, Zambia, while Californian photographer Jeff Nadler captures the moment from the river bank

Surrounded: A crocodile can be seen with its jaws open as it surrounds the carcass of a dead hippo in South Luangwa, Zambia

They circled the waters taking it in turns to rip flesh from the hippo with the biggest crocodiles - measuring up to 5m long - being first in the pecking order.

Mr Nadler said: 'There is usually admiration and appreciation for the prowess and strength of most predators but crocs are different.

'They evoke a feeling of revulsion and a sense of horror at the thought of how they would kill you; drowning in turpid water grasped in their jaws while they spin to rip chunks of flesh off your body.

'Being so close to them, it easy to imagine how horrible death-by-crocodile would be.

Strong swimmers: Two crocodiles swim against the current of the Grumeti River in Tanzania - which boasts some of the largest crocodiles in Africa

Striking: Water glistens on the skin of a crocodile swimming along the Grumeti River in Tanzania

Hungry: Three crocodiles line up in the Grumeti River, Tanzania, with their mouths open to try and catch fish

Taking a break: Three crocodiles relax in the sun by the Grumeti River in Tanzania

'So when out of the vehicle, it is important to remain at least seven metres away from the water's edge.

'Crocs are excellent ambush predators and will launch themselves from the murky water to snatch the unwary, both human and animal.

'Sliding down the spillway to the waiting crocs would have been fatal.'

Mr Nadler has also travelled to the Grumeti River in Tanzania where crocodiles - some of the largest in Africa - enjoy an annual feast during the wildebeest migration.

Going in for the kill: The Nile can be seen opening it jaws to try and garb one of the wildebeests

About 1.5 million wildebeest travel from the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Tanzania every year - but many don't make it.

The ferocious Nile crocodile - one of the most aggressive forms of the species - lies in wait on the Mara river bed for weeks before launching a frenzied attack on the helpless beasts.

Some of the crocodiles will not have eaten all year before they gorge on wildebeest and other migratory mammals during the crossing that takes place from July to October every year.

Targets: Two wildebeests find themselves directly in the path of the crocodile

Fight for survival: The wildebeest do their best to escape the clutches of the crocodile

The giant predators - that can grow 
to 18ft in length and have one of the strongest bites of any reptile - 
savage so many wildebeest they store the carcasses between rocks to 
devour later.

His striking images show the crocodiles lying in wait for charging for their prey at breathtaking speeds. .

Mr
 Nadler has also captured images showing the crocodiles 'off season' 
waiting with their mouths open to feed on smaller fish that might 
accidentally leap into their jaws.

The
 60-year-old added: 'You gain a true understanding for the daily life 
and death struggles of predator and prey after spending a lot of time 
among Africa's wildlife.'
