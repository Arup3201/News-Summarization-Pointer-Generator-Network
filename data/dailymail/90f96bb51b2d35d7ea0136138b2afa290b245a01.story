West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been linked with a move away from The Hawthorns this January, with both Liverpool and Tottenham rumoured to be interested in his signature.

However, both clubs will do well to secure the England international for as little as the BBC suggested he was worth after a social network blunder.

They tweeted an article suggesting that Liverpool were ready to offer £23 for the Baggies striker, slightly less than his £25million asking price.

West Brom's social media team saw the funny side, though, and responded to the tweet in hilarious fashion as they picked up on the amusing error.

The striker has become one of the Premier League's hottest prospects since breaking on to the scene at the Hawthorns and has been heavily linked with a move away.

But the BBC conceded that any team signing the striker may have to pay slightly more than the £23 they reported, blaming the Monday morning error on a long weekend.
