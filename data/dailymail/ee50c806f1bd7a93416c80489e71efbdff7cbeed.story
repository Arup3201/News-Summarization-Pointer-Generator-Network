Channel 4 will screen a controversial documentary tonight in which a paedophile speaks openly about his attraction to four-year-old girls.

The broadcaster has been criticised by victim support campaigners for giving airtime to the 39-year-old man, called Eddie, and encouraging him to discuss his urges.

The National Association for People Abused in Childhood [NAPAC] said victims would be ‘offended’ by the film and said it should have devoted its airtime and resources to helping people who have been abused as children.

Candid: Eddie appears on the Channel 4 documentary to speak about his attraction to young girls

Self-confessed paedophile Eddie, 39, (pictured) will admit to being sexually attracted to children as young as four in a Channel 4 documentary, but insists he has never committed a crime

However, other charities including the NSPCC praised the programme for shining a light on the need to treat paedophiles before they abuse children or view under-age pornography. In The Paedophile Next Door, a series of experts argue that men like Eddie – who claims he has never offended and who has no criminal record – should not be treated like ‘evil monsters’.

The programme makers suggest paedophiles should be given more support to help them control their urges before they offend. They persuaded Eddie, who did not give his surname, to talk openly about his own experiences despite the risk of reprisals.

He said he first realised he was a paedophile in his mid-20s. ‘It is not the only thing I am but it plays a large part in the make-up of who I am as a person,’ he said. ‘I would much prefer not to have these feelings and these attractions but I have them, and that’s difficult. I have an age of attraction that starts, depending on the individual, as low as five, roughly. Four, five, six.’

The show’s makers said police have no record of Eddie having been convicted and he insisted he had never abused a child. 

He said: ‘A lot of people automatically assume that because I think or feel that way, then I am potentially going to abuse a child … I certainly don’t want to do that kind of thing.’ He suggests it is easier for him not to act on any urges as he is ‘attracted to women of all ages’.

Eddie said he decided to show his face on national television because he feels paedophiles should be treated for their urges rather than being demonised.

Viewers will also see Eddie meet Ian McFadyen, 49, who was abused by a teacher at Caldicott School, Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire (pictured) as a young boy

‘People will probably say “Why isn’t this guy locked up. We should kill this guy,’ he said. ‘People are just waiting for you to offend before they help you. If you don’t have that help, if you don’t have the option to come forward and say “Look I’ve got a problem, I need help”, then what are you changing? You’re changing nothing.’

Peter Saunders, NAPAC’s chief executive, said: ‘This documentary shines the light in the wrong areas. Instead of feeling sorry for poor misunderstood paedophiles, we should be looking at the awful experiences of those who have been abused.’

However, Jon Brown, from the NSPCC, said the film was ‘fantastic’ and that paedophilia is a ‘public health problem’ that needs to be addressed by treating potential offenders as well as punishing them after an offence. He said there are around 250,000 paedophiles in the UK, and predicted many will contact helplines after seeing the film. Eddie has gone to Europe to be treated by a support group that helps paedophiles control their urges.

The documentary also interviewed Ian McFadyen, who was abused at Caldicott Prep School in the 1960s and 1970s while a contemporary of Nick Clegg.

Mr McFadyen said: ‘I’m not here to defend paedophiles but he has not committed a crime.’ 

The Paedophile Next Door will be broadcast on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm.
