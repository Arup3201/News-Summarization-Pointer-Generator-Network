The FA have launched an investigation into West Ham fans mocking the disabled in a chant about Harry Kane, on the day Kevin Kilbane was abused for reporting the matter.

Kilbane, the former Everton and Ireland player, said he felt compelled to speak out after Hammers fans sang that Tottenham star Kane ‘talks like a m*** and plays like one too.'

The Match of the Day pundit found support from anti-discrimination group Kick It Out as well as Ismail Kaji, parliamentary affairs assistant at Mencap, who wrote a letter to West Ham and the FA urging action.

The chants were aimed at Tottenham forward Harry Kane during Sunday's London derby at White Hart Lane

Kilbane is a patron of the Down’s Syndrome Association and his 10-year-old daughter Elsie has the condition. He went on Radio 5 Live  to explain how he found the chant distressing and addressed the anger his complaint had provoked in certain quarters.

He was accused of being washed-up, branded a ‘grass’, and told to ‘stop crying’ by some Twitter users. He was also called a ‘m***’ among other vile terms.

But many others backed Kilbane, one posting: ‘Never knew mocking disabled was important part of the game.’

Kevin Kilbane reported the club to the FA after hearing about the chants from his biographer Andy Merriman

Kilbane said: ‘I have two daughters, Elsie and Isla, my youngest. If she heard this chanting she would be distraught as much as Elsie. I had to speak to the FA but there were a number of other complaints that went in, not just me.’

Kilbane was not at Sunday’s game, but his biographer Andy Merriman — a Spurs season ticket-holder — contacted him afterwards. Merriman’s daughter, Sarah, also has Down’s Syndrome.

The FA are also aware of video showing West Ham fans singing anti-Semitic songs on a Tube carriage the same day. The club said fans found guilty of such chanting will be banned.

Sam Allardyce's side are now subject to a probe from the FA after the chants from the West Ham fans
