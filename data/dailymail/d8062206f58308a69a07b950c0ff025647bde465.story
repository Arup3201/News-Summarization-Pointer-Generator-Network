Defending champion Marc Marquez made it seven wins from as many races in this year's MotoGP by taking the plaudits on his home circuit of Catalunya.

The Spaniard had started second on the grid on his Honda, but took the lead from Italy's Valentino Rossi with six laps to go before also holding off a late challenge from team-mate Dani Pedrosa.

Pedrosa's battle with Marquez was a tight affair until the final stages, when the former clipped his team-mate's wheel and almost came off his bike - allowing Rossi to sneak through on his Yamaha and snatch second.

Great Britain's Bradley Smith placed eighth.

Victory leaves Marquez on 175 points in the standings, ahead of Rossi (117) and Pedrosa (112).
