A video has revealed the heartbreaking and surreal images survivors of the Oklahoma tornado must have encountered in their dozens as they emerged from their storm shelters following Monday's record storm.

Jay Leger filmed the moment he opened the hatch on his shelter and first saw the devastation above ground.

It is a moment which was no doubt replicated for many who emerged to see their homes, businesses and lives destroyed.

And it is just one of several dramatic videos which have emerged from the horrific natural disaster that has claimed the lives of at least 24 - including several children - and destroyed dozens of homes.

On the footage, which appears to be 
taken with a cell phone a voice can be heard warning, 'Jay, if
it is still windy I don't want you going out there.'

Soon the cameraman understands the understatement of the word windy as he surveys the damage above.

'Wow,' is all the unidentified survivor can manage before adding 'The lord giveth and the lord taketh away.'

And he wasn't the only survivor to record footage of the 
heartbreaking scenes around the area.

From a terrifying video captured by a
worker in the parking lot of Kentucky Fried Chicken to the 
heartbreaking scene of a rescue group searching desperately for a boy 
named 'Tommy', some of the most dramatic footage of the Oklahoma tornado
has been captured by people directly in its path.Â 

24 people have been confirmed dead 
after a two mile-wide tornado touched down in a highly-populated suburb 
of Oklahoma City in one of the worst storms the area has ever seen on 
Monday afternoon.

The monstrous tornado roared through 
the Oklahoma City suburbs obliterating entire neighborhoods with winds 
up to 200 mph pulverizing a 30-square-mile stretch.

In an effort to get the story out as 
soon as possible, one local man took to social media and posted 
six-second clips on Twitter, that show fellow residents 
searching through the piles of rubble- that used to be their homes- 
while looking for loved ones.

The same man also shot another video of the swarms of police cars patrolling the devastated area in 
search of survivors, while an injured man seeks medical attention for 
his wounds.
