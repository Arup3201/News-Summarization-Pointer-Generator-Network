Bill Kenwright has opened the door for Wayne Rooney to make a sensational return to Everton in the coming years.

The Toffees chairman was bullish in his assessment that the England captain will wear the blue shirt again by saying: ‘He comes back to Goodison’.

Rooney spent his early career dazzling on Merseyside and – even before playing a game for the first team in 2002 – claimed that ‘once a blue always a blue’.

While Everton supporters struggled to forgive the striker after a £26million move to Manchester United, Kenwright sees no problems if he wanted to see out his career back where it all started.

The exit to Sir Alex Ferguson’s United in 2004 was acrimonious, although the depth of ill-feeling has subsided significantly.

‘He comes back to Goodison. He's an Evertonian and his family are. He is welcome to come back,’ he told BBC Radio 5Live.

Rooney - who surpassed a century of caps for his country at the weekend - is tied down to another five years at Old Trafford. Crucially for Everton supporters, the 69-year-old didn’t bring up the issue of money.

His wages are astronomical in relation to what Everton pay their players, but Kenwright sees no reason why they can’t lure the 29-year-old back before he retires.

‘In all honesty, all I ever do is advise,’ he added. ‘I am not sidestepping the question. It is always going to be Roberto Martinez's choice.’
