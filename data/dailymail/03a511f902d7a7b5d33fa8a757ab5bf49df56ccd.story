McLaren have rejected suggestions Canadian billionaire businessman Lawrence Stroll is poised to take up a shareholding in the Formula One team.

Fashion magnate Stroll has recently been linked with investment in Sauber and Marussia as he eyes a position in the sport.

A report in Italy this week has claimed Stroll is ready to become a shareholder in McLaren, with Mansour Ojjeh, part owner of the TAG group of companies, looking to exit.

But a McLaren spokesman said: 'McLaren Group has not received any notification from any of its shareholders in respect of a wish to sell any shares in the company.

'In order to be able to sell shares in the company, they must first be offered to the other shareholders.

'These rumours are therefore without a foundation.'
