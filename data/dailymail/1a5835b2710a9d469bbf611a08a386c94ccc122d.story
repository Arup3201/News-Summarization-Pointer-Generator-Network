An overweight barman who went on a diet to get a girlfriend is now fighting off the ladies after becoming a dead ringer for One Direction's Zayn Malik.

Connor Sayer, 20, tipped the scales at over 14 stone due to his habitual heavy drinking sessions and a love of takeaways.

But Connor decided to get in shape to land a girlfriend, lost four stone - and developed an uncanny resemblance to the X-Factor heartthrob.

Heading in the right direction: Connor Sayer, 20, after he turned his life around by losing four stone and restyling himself as a Zayn Malik lookalike

And after slimming down to 10 stone, he is now is swamped with offers from girls - and modelling agencies.

Connor is even juggling two girlfriends at the same time.

He said: 'I was always the funny guy, the guy who made you laugh but who was always single. I was the token fat lad of the group.

'All my mates were skinny and had girlfriends, and so I overcompensated by being arrogant and thinking I was cool.

'In reality, I was just self-conscious and insecure. I didn't realise I looked anything like Zayn Malik until my friends told me I should start modelling.

'I put some pictures up on Facebook and I was inundated with messages from girls telling me how much I looked like him.

'Now, when I go to the pub or go out on a night out, girls just flock to me asking me for my number.'

Connor, of Doncaster, Yorkshire - the same county as Malik - piled on the pounds late in his teens, although he admits he was a chubby school kid.

He said: 'I was always the fat one, but when I started drinking, that's when it got worse. I hated being around my mates who were skinny and had girlfriends.

That's what makes him beautiful: He piled on the pounds with heavy drinking sessions and takeaways - before turning over a new leaf with the popular 5:2 diet

'I used to just laugh off my problems and I would drink five days of the week, and never do any exercise.

'I tried to lose weight in the past, but with no girlfriend to notice, I gave up pretty quickly.'

Connor, who works part-time as a barman, decided enough was enough, and after reading an article about the 5:2 diet, he decided to give it a go.

Fasting for two days a week, and eating healthily on the other five, Connor saw the difference almost immediately.

As he was: Connor tipped the scales at more than 14 stone and described himself as the 'class clown' who no one took seriously

'The first two weeks were the toughest because my body had to get used to being denied food,' he said. 'After that my stomach shrank and I wasn't able to eat what I did before.

'I started cycling four miles every day and the weight just fell off.'

Connor lost four stone in total, and the transformation has turned his life around.

He approached an agency and is now modelling part-time, but he says the best thing about looking like Zayn Malik is the attention he gets from girls.

He said: 'It's a massive compliment that girls even find me attractive at all, as I still see the same lad, just a bit skinnier.

'My confidence has increased enormously, and I can't go to a pub without getting propositioned. And if they think I'm really him, who am I to tell them otherwise?

'I'm not a huge fan of One Direction, but after people told me I looked like one of them, I started listening to them. Now, I'm a total One Directioner.'
