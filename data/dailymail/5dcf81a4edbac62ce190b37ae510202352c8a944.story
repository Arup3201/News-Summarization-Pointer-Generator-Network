A 101-year-old Rolls-Royce dubbed the ‘Best Car in the World’ is expected to fetch £550,000 at auction.

The stunning Rolls-Royce was the height of luxury when it rolled off the production line in 1911 - costing up to ten times more than the average professional's annual wage at around £1500 each.

The same amount would have been enough to buy a large house in the country at the time.

The car was officially named the 40/50hp but it soon picked up the 'Silver Ghost' moniker from owners and journalists because of its supreme quality.

The best car in the world: A 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost is set to sell for £550,000 at auction

Luxurious: The Silver Ghost, which once belonged to Sir Adolph Tuck - the son of Raphael Tuck who made his fortune in the postcard business, has a red leather interior

The classic car, which was first launched in 1906, was even named the 'Best car in the world' by the prestigious publication Autocar in 1907.

This particular model was made in 1911 and delivered on April 1 that year to Sir Adolph Tuck, the son of Raphael Tuck who made his fortune in the postcard industry at the end of the 19th century.

Sir Adoph had the Rolls-Royce, which comes with its own champagne holder and picnic basket, fitted with a Landaulette body so he could be chauffeur driven around.

It was later re-bodied as a period two-seat tourer by Rippon Brothers Ltd, a coach building company with a proud history dating back centuries, which made a chariot throne for Queen Elizabeth I in 1584.

With Ghosts very rarely coming onto the open market, this classic example of luxury British engineering is expected to attract global interest when it is sold at Brooklands on September 1.

Auction house Historics, which is managing the sale, has set a guide price of £450,000 to £550,000 for when it goes under the hammer.

Classic build: The Silver Ghost boasts a 7.4-litre engine and is known for its quality

Edward Bridger-Stille, Historics auction director, said: 'To find a Silver Ghost for sale is a red letter day. 

'The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost is a treasured car, it was so advanced and expensive when it was launched. It could cost the same a country home.

'As an auctioneer there are cars you like to be offered to sell and this is certainly one of them.

'The opportunity to acquire a Silver Ghost as beautiful as this is extremely rare and I anticipate that this significant, museum quality example, should generate interest from all corners of the world.'

The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost was launched in 1906 with Henry Royce building it to showcase the highest level of engineering skill alongside an unrivalled passion for quality.

It was an overwhelming success with Autocar calling it the Best Car in the World the following year.

This model, which goes by the name ‘Chassis 1557’, was fitted with a 7.4-litre engine which produced between 40bhp and 50bhp.

To demonstrate the car’s quality, a Silver Ghost was driven from London to Edinburgh and back in top gear the whole way, managing an incredible 24mpg.

In 1977, Chassis 1557 attended the Queen’s Jubilee parade through Windsor Castle to the Silver Ring at Ascot Racecourse.

It underwent as full restoration in 2001, and has picked up a number of prizes at concours events organised by the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts’ Club.

Phillip Brooks, a Rolls-Royce historian, said: 'Silver Ghosts are the cars that made the factory’s reputation, and they were wonderful cars in their day and are still wonderful cars now.

'Chassis 1557 would be great fun to drive from John O’Groats to Lands End, or just as easily from New York to San Francisco.'
