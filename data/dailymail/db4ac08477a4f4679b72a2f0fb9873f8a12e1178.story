Terrorists are trying to use a European court ruling to wipe stories about their trials from Google in a move which amounts to censorship by the back door, Sajid Javid warned today.

The Culture Secretary condemned ‘Luxembourg’s unelected judges’ who created the so-called ‘right to be forgotten’ by forcing search engines to remove links to news stories.

In a forthright speech to newspaper editors, Mr Javid accused European courts of ‘trying to restrict media freedom’ and took aim at the BBC for competing with news websites like MailOnline.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid warned unaccountable European judges were 'trying to restrict media freedom’, creating a new right to be forgotten which amounted to 'censorship by the back door'

Last month it emerged Google has deleted more than 18,000 web links following requests from UK.

The 15-year campaign by the Daily Mail for justice in the Stephen Lawrence murder case ‘is what British newspapers are all about’, Mr Javid said.

He said the Lawrence family was ‘badly let down’ by a failure to investigate the crime properly and praised the Mail for a campaign that led to the jailing of two men for the killing.

‘The Daily Mail refused to let the Lawrence family stand alone,’ he said.

‘A team of talented journalists and editors did all they could to help bring Stephen’s killers to justice. Not just the famous front page of February 14, 1997 – but the 15 years of investigations, revelations and exposés that followed, keeping the case firmly in the public and political spotlight.

‘Doing so took courage, dedication and no small measure of journalistic skill.’

Requests from Britain included a former clergyman who wanted to remove links to articles about a sex abuse investigation and a doctor who botched a medical procedure.

Google said it deleted 35 per cent, or 18,459, of the unwanted links Britons requested be removed.

Mr Javid said the scale of the attempts to remove links to news stories was a threat to journalism.

‘Since Luxembourg’s unelected judges created the so-called “right to be forgotten”, Google has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds,’ he told the Society of Editors conference in Southampton.

‘Each day, a thousand requests pour in from people who, for one reason or another, would prefer their pasts to be kept secret.

‘Criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other, similar crimes.

‘Terrorists have ordered Google to cover up stories about their trials.’ 

The EU's ‘right to be forgotten’ legislation allows European citizens to request that links to ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant’ information be removed from Google search results

Mr Javid added: ‘The “right to be forgotten” is censorship by the back door. Stories are not being deleted from archives because of the ruling, but if they cannot be found by the search engines they may as well not be there at all.’

Newspaper websites have received notifications from Google that it has deleted links to their articles. 

Sajid Javid questioned whether the BBC website should be competing with commercial news sites like MailOnline.

In his speech, the Culture Secretary pointed to Ofcom figures which show that almost 60 per cent of online news consumers use the BBC website or app, with Sky News trailing behind on just 17 per cent.

On mobile devices, BBC News has 14.5 million unique users, compared to just 4.2 million for second-placed Sky News, he said.  

'The highest-ranked newspaper, the Mail, is third with 3.4 million,' he said.

However, on closer inspection of the figures referenced by Mr Javid, it appears the data refers to mobile readership figures for news on the BBC and on Sky not to BBC News and Sky News. 

He continued: 'This digital dominance looks set to be cemented as this generation grows up.

'Most adults aged under 24 already head to the internet – rather than TV, radio or print – for their fix of news. 

'As with so many of the changes brought about by the internet, it raises a lot of questions.

'Is it healthy for a publicly funded broadcaster to compete with commercial newspapers?

'Should the BBC share its local public service content under a creative commons licence?' 

MailOnline publisher Martin Clarke has said: ‘It is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don’t like.’

The European Court of Justice ruled people had a right to ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ information about them to be dropped from internet searches.

The decision – which cannot be appealed against and is binding for all EU states – affects only search results and not lawfully published and true information.

But once search engines like Google drop links to such material, it becomes almost impossible to find on the internet. Facebook was the site which had the most links removed, followed by the social network search site Profile Engine and video sharing site YouTube.

Google gave anonymised examples of requests it had received. 

In Britain, they included the former clergyman who asked for two links to articles about a sex abuse investigation while he was still a religious leader to be removed.

The search engine refused his request, and said it considered ‘the rights of the individual as well as public interest in the content’ when assessing each request.

Google also refused an application from a doctor who wanted more than 50 links to articles about a botched procedure removed.

Three pages that contained personal information about the doctor but not about the procedure were removed from search results for his name, but links to reports about the incident were not deleted.

Europe's top court ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which has led to the search engine being bombarded with requests. 

More than 90,000 removal requests involving more than 328,000 URLs have been made to Google worldwide.

The content itself has not been deleted from MailOnline, but Google will not list it in search results.

Instead, users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that says: ‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’ at the bottom of the page.

The latest articles to be removed from MailOnline include: 

The European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’.

Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'

This relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally.

The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data’.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it.

If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined.
