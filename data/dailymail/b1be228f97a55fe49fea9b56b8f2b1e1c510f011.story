Festival goers need never run out of phone battery again thanks to a new range of denim shorts and sleeping bags that use body heat and movement to generate electricity.

The Power Shorts and Recharge Sleeping Bag can charge a phone's battery by harvesting energy from the human body using kinetic and thermoelectric technology.

The wearable phone chargers have been designed by mobile phone company Vodafone with help from the University of Southampton. 

Vodafone has teamed up with the University of Southampton to create wearable phone chargers for festival goers. The Power Shorts, pictured,  capture kinect energy from the wearer's body movements. This energy can then be used to charge mobile handsets

This image explains how the Power Shorts work. They are fitted with foam-like ferroelectret smart materials which contain voids. The surfaces of these voids are permanently charged and as the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes,when they're squashed or deformed, a charge is produced

The shorts are fitted with a phone connector and ferroelectret materials.

As the wearer moves, the shorts gather kinetic energy when these ferroelectret materials are squashed or deformed.

The surfaces of these voids are permanently charged.

As the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes, a charge is produced on the surface of the material.

The Recharge Sleeping Bag harvests thermal energy using the 'Seebeck Effect'.

This effect is a process that produces an electrical charge causes by the changes in temperature of a thermoelectric 
module.

These modules are printed on the fabric of the sleeping bag.

The Power Shorts are fitted with foam-like ferroelectret materials.

As the wearer moves, the shorts gather kinetic energy when these ferroelectret materials are squashed or deformed.

These foam-like materials contain voids.

The surfaces of these voids are permanently charged and exhibit piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties.

The word piezoelectricity means electricity resulting from pressure.

When pressure is applied to the materials in the shorts they generate an electric charge.

As the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes this creates the electricity needed to charge the phone attached to the shorts by a connector inside the Power Pocket.

The Recharge Sleeping Bag harvests thermal energy using the 'Seebeck Effect'.

This effect creates pyroelectricity, which is the ability of certain materials to generate a temporary charge when they are heated up or cooled down.

In the case of the sleeping bag, this process monitors the change of temperature through a thermoelectric 
module fitted to the fabric of the bag.

Heat from the sleeper's body flows through this module contained within a multi-layered 'power felt'.

This felt contains polymer films and two semi conductors that generate an electric charge as they heat up.

The Recharge Sleeping Bag works by harvesting thermal energy from the sleeper's body heat. As the wearer sleeps, thermoelectric modules capture thermal energy. These modules contain insulating polymer films and two semi conductors that create an electric voltage to charge the phone in the Power Pocket

Vodafone's Power Shorts and sleeping bag are not the first wearable phone chargers.

In June 2010, phone operator Orange 
announced its Power Wellies that have a power-generating sole which 
converts heat from the wearer's feet into electrical current.

This 'welectricity', as the makers call it, can then be used to charge a mobile phone.

Twelve hours of stomping through the muddy fields of festival sites will give you one hour of phone use.

Bouncing up and down in the dance 
tent gives you even more call time - because the hotter your feet get, 
the more energy is produced.

The Power Wellies were created with renewable energy experts GotWind.

Trials conducted by Vodafone found that a full day’s walking and dancing while wearing the shorts can provide enough energy to charge a phone for four hours.

While heat from a night in the sleeping bag is said to create 11 hours of charge.

Prof Stephen Beeby from the university said: 'We’re exploring two specific technologies to charge 
the Power Pocket - thermoelectrics and kinetic energy harvesting.

'Both represent cutting-edge research around smart fabrics and, in this case, we’re looking to integrate these into a sleeping bag and a pair of denim shorts.'

Vodafone's Christian Cull added: 'Our ambition was to create a
 practical but exciting solution to the charging-related issues 
experienced by many at outdoor events.

'We hope people harness the power in their pocket to keep them 
chatting, texting, browsing and photographing throughout the entire 
festival season.'

The ‘smart fabric’ technology will be
 unveiled ahead of this weekend’s Isle of Wight Festival and will 
continue to be developed throughout the summer.
