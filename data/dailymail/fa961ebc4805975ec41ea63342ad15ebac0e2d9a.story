Former Australian captain Allan Border believes the first Test should go ahead, but it'll be a very personal decision for players whether they take part.

The prospect of a four-Test series against India due to start at The Gabba in seven days has become trivial for Australia's best cricketers following Phillip Hughes' tragic death.

Captain Michael Clarke and vice-captain Brad Haddin have been among the many Test players to regularly visit Hughes at St Vincent's Hospital following Tuesday's freak accident.

First Test squad members Haddin, David Warner, Shane Watson and Nathan Lyon were all in the field for NSW when Hughes slumped to the ground at the SCG after being struck by a bouncer.

'There will be guys, particularly the guys that were out on the field at the time that are named in the Test squad, they mightn't be feeling like playing cricket at the moment,' Border told Fox Sports before the death was confirmed by Cricket Australia.

'You'd understand if they wanted to pull out. But I think the game should go ahead.

'We're all a bit numb at the moment.

'I get the feeling that Phillip would want the game to go ahead. But if the individuals don't feel up it, then so be it.'

'I get the feeling Phillip would want the game to go ahead': Cricket legend Allan Border said whether players' participate in the first Test against India will be a personal decision. Many will likely opt out, he said

Cricket Australia's full attention is with Hughes, not the match slated to start next Thursday in Brisbane.

'In regards to those fixtures later on, that's not something we've had any specific conversations on yet,' Australian Cricketers Association chief Alistair Nicholson said on Wednesday.

Former Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy felt the first Test wouldn't be delayed, telling Big Sports Breakfast it could give the XI a chance to go out and represent Hughes.

Ex-Test paceman Brendon Julian told Fox Sports he believed there was potential the Test would not go ahead and it was hard to see how players could be in the right state of mind for it.
