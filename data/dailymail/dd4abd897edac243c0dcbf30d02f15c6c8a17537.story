Even now, three years on, Martin Johnson struggles to comprehend his dramatic demise as England manager and the controversial events that preceded his resignation. He has regrets, but also a lingering sense of defiance.

The 44-year-old World Cup-winning captain kept the lowest of profiles since his fall from grace following England’s scandal-ridden failure in 2011. But now he has spoken for the first time about the events that led to the end of his tenure.

‘Looking back at it, of course I would have done things differently,’ he said. ‘We can all do that. You do what you think is right at the time, that’s all you can do. We could all say we’d go back and change things.

September 11: Mike Tindall, Chris Ashton, Toby Flood and Dylan Hartley reportedly take part in a 'dwarf-throwing' contest in a bar in Queenstown.

September 13: Courtney Lawes is handed a two-game ban for 'recklessly striking' Argentina's Mario Ledesma with his knee. 

Johnson defends allowing his players to go bungee jumping on their day off.

September 29: Kicking coach Dave Alred and fitness specialist Paul Stridgeon are suspended after being found to have switched the ball Jonny Wilkinson was due to kick against Romania with without asking the permission of referee.

October 2: Johnson reprimands three players for making inappropriate comments to a female hotel worker.

October 9: Manu Tuilagi is formally warned by police and fined £3,000 by England rugby officials after jumping from a ferry in Auckland.

‘We got caught out off the field. We were aware of what could happen and warned the players, but it still happened. We warned the players about it and you think you’ve covered it, when maybe you haven’t covered it. Maybe you have to say it every day.

‘The difficult thing is that it gets perceived as something that it wasn’t really. I’m not saying that things didn’t happen, but I’m saying the perception is that that was the only thing that happened. That became the story rather than the rugby, and that’s what gets remembered.

‘In 2003, once you’ve won the World Cup, everything is portrayed as being great and a perfect working machine. But of course it wasn’t; we were all human beings, we all made mistakes, had our frailties and did similar things that the boys did in 2011. It just didn’t get to that level and didn’t get recorded. And then you win, so everything is all right.’

What is clear is that the episodes in New Zealand which left him in an untenable position have left deep scars. On his watch, in the midst of a high-profile event, England’s reputation was tarnished by unseemly episodes off the field — primarily the infamous dwarf-tossing night out in Queenstown after an opening pool-stage victory against Argentina.

Caught in the eye of a storm, Johnson made the mistake of playing down the matter, with his notorious ‘rugby player drinks beer, shock’ remark.

Having stubbornly refused to strike a remorseful tone, Johnson’s position was further undermined as England blundered from one crisis to another; from inappropriate behaviour towards hotel staff, to illicit match-ball swapping, to Manu Tuilagi’s dive off a ferry into Auckland harbour. By the end of that World Cup, as his side were dispatched by France in the quarter-finals, the manager cut a shattered and forlorn figure.

His resignation followed, as did the knife-twist of leaked reports which provided a damning postscript — with players criticising many aspects of the England regime.

Though the dust has long since settled and the national team has been revitalised on the back of Stuart Lancaster’s overhaul of personnel and culture, Johnson still believes he and his regime were, in part, victims of what he considers to be false perception.

‘It wasn’t actually a true reflection of those people and what we were about,’ he said ‘But you’re fighting a tidal wave almost at that point because everyone “knows” what’s happened because they’ve read about it.

‘People start telling me what it was like when I was there — that’s the battle you have to win. That was my mistake; you have to win that battle as well. It’s almost like a sales job.’

During his tenure as England manager, Johnson presided over a record of 21 wins, 16 defeats and a draw in 38 Tests. Yet, for all the criticism which came his way at the end, he was at pains to emphasise the fact that he presided over the country’s only Six Nations title success since 2003, along with the introduction of several players who have become stalwarts of the Lancaster regime.

‘People go, “It was a disaster at the World Cup”, but England have won one Championship in the last 11 years and that was in 2011,’ he said. ‘We won 10 out of 13 games that year and we did OK.

‘Ultimately, we brought through a lot of players who had a successful start to their career, although we were criticised for not doing that.

‘Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Ben Youngs, Chris Ashton, Ben Foden and Manu Tuilagi all came through. In 2008-09 there was a lack of guys who were really putting their hands up to play Test rugby. We did start bringing some through and they played well.’

His words suggest that the subject of his legacy is another scar — another perception issue. While Lancaster implemented a revamp of the England with an influx of youth, Johnson makes plain that he had laid some of the ground-work. He has stayed quiet for so long, but now he has stuck his head back above the parapet, to try to set the record straight.
