Manchester City's title aspirations were dealt a blow as they were held to a draw with Everton at Goodison Park. Fernandinho opened the scoring for City on 74 minutes, but the lead was short-lived with Steven Naismith pegging one back for the Toffees just four minutes later. Here, Dan King runs through how the players performed. 

Everton (4-2-3-1) 

Joel Robles - 7

Not a keeper who inspires confidence but, in the main, his decision making was good and couldn't be faulted for City's goal

Seamus Coleman - 7 

Has been through a difficult spell but was much better here, defended well and cracked the bar with a left foot drive

John Stones - 8.5 

Will be a mainstay of England's defence in years to come, an impeccable performance and calming presence on the back four 

Everton's Ross Barkley weaves his way between Fernandinho (left) and Fernando (right) at Goodison Park

Phil Jagielka - 7.5

Had a goal chalked off but his most important contributions came at the other end. Some crucial tackles 

Leighton Baines - 7

Quiet in some aspects and a few free-kicks lacked direction but his delivery that provided the equaliser for Naismith was magnificent 

 Muhammed Besic - 6.5

Frustrations threatened to boil over at times when he kept being penalised for robust challenges. Relentless workrate  

Everton keeper Joel Robles smothers the loose ball as Samir Nasri bears down on goal 

Gareth Barry - 7

No doubt he misses the presence of James McCarthy but a reunion against his old employers saw him in a better light

Aiden McGeady - 5.5

Struggling to replicate what he does in training on the big stage. Some good moments but not enough of an influence 

Ross Barkley - 6 

Restored to his more favoured central position but found it difficult to make an impact; no shots on target 

Steven Naismith - 7.5

 The most improved player in Everton's squad again illustrated his importance with prodigious work and well taken goal

Playmarker David Silva pulls the strings from midfield at Goodison Park

Romelu Lukaku -7.5 

Took confidence from his equaliser against West Ham, played well. Denied a goal by terrific save from Hart

SUBSTITUTES

Kevin Mirallas-  6.5

Manchester City  (4-2-3-1) 

Joe Hart - 6

One fine stop to deny Lukaku but questions must be asked over his role in letting Naismith beat him to the punch for the equaliser

Pablo Zabaleta - 7.5

Brilliant tackle on Lukaku set the wheels in motion on the attack that led to City's goal. Ultra-reliable as ever 

Everton's Seamus Coleman surges forward and has a crack at goal, but sees his effort go over the bar

Martin Demichelis - 7.5

Once a figure of derision, now showing his class. Need to be at his best with his partner finding things so tough

Eliaquim Mangala - 5 

All over the place at times, bullied by Lukaku and finding the frenzy difficult to deal. Been a tough season for him 

Gael Clichy - 5.5

No standout contribution. Got forward at times but with little impact; defend reasonably well

Steven Jovetic is tugged back by Everton's John Stones as he makes a break down the middle of the park

Fernandinho - 6.5

A key cog in the title winning side and had another telling influence. Didn't give Barkley any space to cause trouble

Fernando - 5.5 

Won't have been involved in too many games like this and found it all happening too quickly. No major impact

Jesús Navas -  6

Fluffed a great chance when fed by his compatriot and led break for Fernandinho's goal but, again, not enough

Fernandinho opens the scoring with his second goal of the season on 74 minutes

David Silva - 8 

A joy to watch, had Everton in a panic every time he got possession. Played a different game to the others in laser blue

Samir Nasri- 6

Has played well this season but this was not one of his most effective games; that said, he was involved in build-up to City's goal 

Manchester City's lead is short-lived as Steven Naismith equalises minutes later with a header of his own

Stevan Jovetic - 5

Adopted a shoot-on-sight policy in the first half but couldn't hit a barn door from six yards. Dragged off in second half

SUBSTITUTES

Sergio Aguero - 6

Frank Lampard - 6

 

Goals – Fernandinho (75), Naismith (77)

Bookings – Mangala, Stones, Fernandinho

Referee – Martin Atkinson 

Attendance – 39,449

Man-of-the-Match – John Stones
