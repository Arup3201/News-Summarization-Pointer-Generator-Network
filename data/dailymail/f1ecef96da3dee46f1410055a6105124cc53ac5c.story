Alistair Hey, a 57-year-old man who lives in a plush Queenstown neighbourhood in New Zealand, was sentenced to 70 hours of community work last week in the Invercargill District Court for assaulting his neighbour Tim Clark with weed killer last month.

The neighbours came to a head on September 14, when Clark's wife became distressed due to the continuous loud music coming from Hey's house, which had been playing for two days straight.    

'I called the council number and they sent an Armourguard guy to listen at seven or eight in the morning,' Clark told Stuff.co.nz.

'He noted that it was on and it was annoying and objectionable but Alistair wasn't there. He wasn't even in the house.

'About 5pm in the afternoon I saw his garage door was open. I walked out and he was at the top of the access road with the spray bottle.' 

Clark said he approached Hey and politely asked him to turn down the music. 

However, after asking him for a third time, Hey turned on Clark and sprayed him straight in the face with weed killer.

The men then lunged for each other but Clark's son managed to break the fight up.   

Since the incident, Clark has revealed that he is planning on moving away from the area. 

Hey was also convicted in January for assaulting his 71-year-old neighbour Geoffrey Hamilton. 

Hamilton moved to Australia after the incident and another neighbour, Frank Schreiber, relocated to Ireland.
