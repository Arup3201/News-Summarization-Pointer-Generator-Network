A gang of thieves on scooters stole designer handbags from a luxury boutique in central London this morning in the latest of a spate of similar raids in the capital.

Three mopeds - two with pillion passengers - pulled up outside the expensive Valentino shop in Sloane Street shortly after midnight last night and used one of the bikes to force open the door.

The gang - all wearing dark clothing and helmets - then made off with designer items thought to be worth thousands of pounds.

Smash and grab: A member of the gang of thieves breaks into the Valentino store and then grabs valuable handbags

The Valentino store in Sloane Street, central London was the latest target in a spate of smash and grab raids by gangs on mopeds

Aftermath: The shelves at the store lie almost empty after the robbers stole expensive bags

One man has since been arrested in Ladbroke Grove, west London, where police recovered a scooter but no stolen property. He remains in custody.

The raid comes just days after a similar incident at the Larizia store in St John's Wood High Street, north west London, on July 28 when handbags valued at around £100,000 were taken.

Seven people were arrested in relation to that robbery and have been bailed to appear in August.

The Metropolitan Police said it is too early to say if the latest raid, after which two scooters made off towards Marylebone and the third towards Kilburn, is linked to any others.

The Dorchester Hotel was raided twice in one month earlier this summer, with a gang of four arriving on mopeds before smashing open display cabinets and making off with jewellery and designer goods. Two men have been charged in relation to the incident.

Two weeks ago, a Scotland Yard detective warned that moped smash and grab raids were 'in fashion' amongst criminals, who see shops as easier targets than security vans.

Larizia in St John's Wood was raided in similar fashion last week. Seven people have been arrested and bailed

It comes after the Dorchester Hotel was targeted in a similar way last month, when thieves (pictured) arrived on mopeds, smashed display cabinets and stole jewellery and handbags. Two men have been charged

DCI Paul Johnson said: 'These raids are in fashion and we are going to take them out of fashion, we are going to show people that they are going to get put before the court and suitably punished if they carry out these crimes.

'Cash in transit robberies have fallen 30 per cent year on year over the past four years and are continuing downwards.

'We have worked with the cash in transit industry to improve security and safety and as a result it is now harder for criminals to get away with them.

'As a result they are turning to the expensive shops in the West End.'

He spoke after four teenagers were arrested near the scene of a moped raid on a luxury watch shop in London's West End.
