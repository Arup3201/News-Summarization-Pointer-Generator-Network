A British holidaymaker died of alcohol poisoning after downing dozens of vodka and Red Bull cocktails during a three day binge in Crete, an inquest heard.

Adam Walker, 22, was three-and-a-half times the legal drink drive limit when he was found dead on his hotel bed on June 6 by his friend Damien Farmer.

An inquest heard the pair had spent three days in Malia on the island of Crete, drinking excessively.

Mr Farmer told police the night before Mr Walker died they had been to a 'paint party' where they had downed vodka and Red Bull and sprayed themselves with paint.

An autopsy carried out the day after his death in Crete found Mr Walker had the equivalent of 280mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, compared to the legal limit of 80mg.

Worcestershire Coroner Geraint William told the hearing Mr Walker had a large amount of alcohol in his bloodstream and died of acute alcohol poisoning.

Recording the cause of death as abuse of alcohol, Mr Williams described the amount he had drunk as 'excessive'.

He told Mr Walker's devastated parents: 'They were enjoying themselves clearly but also, without going into detail, drinking a lot of alcohol and playing drinking games.

'He (Mr Farmer) says on the last evening there was a paint party where they were all drinking and spraying themselves with paint.

'He described your son drinking a lot of vodka and Red Bull and going off with another friend before coming back and then going off again.' 

Mr Farmer - who didn't attend the hearing - told Greek police he went back to the hotel room he was sharing with his friend on June 6 and saw him on his bed, apparently asleep.

He was then woken the next morning by a holiday rep knocking on the door.

Coroner Mr Williams added: 'They tried to wake (Mr Walker) and realised he was dead.

'He says he picked up your son's belongings and his own and went to another hotel.

'He described being very upset, as you would expect.'

McDonald's worker Mr Walker, who lived with his parents in Wychbold, Worcestershire, posted a last picture on his Facebook page on June 5, the day before he died.

The image shows the youngster pulling a funny face and wearing a white vest with red trim.

He also posted a status on June 2 saying: 'Holiday bound get in lol'

And on April 27, he wrote: 'MALIA soon can't wait lol now bed time.'

His parents were too upset to comment after the inquest.
