The eldest son in the 'Amityville horror family' has revealed how his experiences in the haunted house in the 1970s ruined his life.

Now a 47-year-old Queens UPS driver, Danny Lutz, was just a 10-year-old boy when his family moved into the Long Island property which had previously been home to a brutal murder.

He and his parents reported 'paranormal activities' at the property and fled - their experience inspiring a book, a 1979 movie and plenty of column inches disputing their claims.

Haunting: Danny Lutz, was 10, when his family lived in the 'possessed house' in Amityville, Long Island. His documentary explores his experiences and life since has family left the home

Horror house: The 2 bedroom property in Amityville was said to be haunted following Ronald DeFeo's murder of his family. The Lutz family, who lived there a year after, claimed it was possessed

Childhood trauma: Danny Lutz, left as a boy, had a troubled relationship with his stepfather, George, center, who his mother, Kathy, ended up divorcing

Now he features in a documentary sharing his experiences - the first time he has spoken publicly about the experience in nearly 40 years.

'I didn't want to be the Amityville horror kid. I’ve been running away from it my whole life and it finally caught up with me.' Lutz says in the trailer for 'My Amityville Horror' which is being released on March 15.

'I was possessed by a spirit I couldn't get rid of on my own. I just wanted somebody to believe me. It has been in my dreams my whole life.'

This is the first time Lutz has spoken of his experiences in the Long Island property as a child.

His family only lived in 112 Ocean Avenue for 28 days in 1975 but their story quickly became famous.  

The year before they moved in, 23-year-old Ronald 'Butch' DeFeo had shot his parents and four siblings dead as they slept.

He was found guilty on six counts of second-degree murder, and is currently imprisoned at Green Haven Correctional Facility in Beekman.

The Lutzs - Kathy, her three children Daniel, Christopher and Missy and new husband George - soon reported strange goings on.

Kathy said she levitated, saw glowing red eyes and began having nightmares about the murder.

George would be woken by strange noises at 3.15am - the time of the murder - while Danny's youngest sister Missy acquired a strange imaginary friend.  

The family said many of the things that happened there echoed the events of the murder and strange smells, cold drafts and moving objects completed their experiences.

A priest who visited the home said he heard a voice telling him to 'Get Out' - later made famous as a soundbite in the movie of their story.

The Lutzs tried to bless the house but they said they experienced things that were 'too frightening' to bear repeating that night.

They later said they believed DeFeo could have been possessed by the evil lurking in the property.

High hopes: The Lutzs received the house at a reduced rate because of the murders that had taken place just a year before

Their story was told in a best-selling book by Jay Anson in 1977. It was made into the famous film starring James Brolin and Margot kidder.

Many dismissed them as trying to profit commericialy from made-up experiences.

But Danny Lutz's account backs those previously given by his parents, who are now deceased.

It also explores his frictional relationship with his stepfather, who his mother later divorced.

On the 'paranormal activity' in the house, he says furniture would move around, voices would whisper to him and he experienced 'bodily possession'.

The film follows Lutz returning to the house, which is currently occupied by another family, but he doesn't go in.

It also shows him refusing to do a polygraph and his anger at experts who believe his experiences could be a case of false memory.

The documentary's maker Eric Walter said the film is much more about what it was like to be the Amityville Kid rather than retelling the Lutzs horror stories.

'He's been carrying around this weight for nearly 40 years,' he told the Wall Street Journal. 'It's not easy to talk about.'

'People being haunted by a haunting is not something I had seen before. The evidence we can present is this man's life, everything that has happened for the last 40 years—it comes down to a family story and it's quite tragic.'

Danny's siblings didn't want to appear in the film.

Christopher is writing a book on the subject and Missy has never spoken about their time in Amityville.
