She's the queen of the 'Protein Princesses' - a new breed of health-conscious female role
 models - so it's no surprise that Millie Mackintosh wants to showcase the fruits of her labour.

The 24-year-old fitness aficionado, who was recently unveiled as the new face of Nip + Fab, has stripped off to showcase her toned physique for the skincare brand's latest campaign. 

Reclining on a bed in racy underwear and black stilettos, Millie proves that all those upside down burpees have been paying off.

Revealing all: Millie Mackintosh is the star of Nip + Fab's new campaign and has stripped off to showcase the results of her healthy lifestyle

Nip + Fab, a beauty range owned by the Rodial brand, wanted to tap into the Millie magic so snapped her up to front its range.

Speaking 
to MailOnline about her new role, Millie said: 'I am delighted to be the
 first-ever face. I have been using the products for a while 
now and I love their cellulite cream, which, along with my healthy diet 
and exercise regime, helps keep my cellulite at bay, so it made sense 
for me to work with them.'

Showing off: Millie clearly wanted to prove that her hard work in the gym has been paying off so stripped down to her underwear

Get the look: Millie says she swears by the Body Slim Fix cream, which she keeps in her bag and uses after a gym sessions

Rodial
 founder Maria Hatzistefanis said: 'Millie is amazing, she's so happy 
and very easy going. I am very impressed with her and love her edgy 
style. She is exactly what we want our brand to represent.' 

Millie revealed the hero products she used to get in shape for the shoot, explaining that she swears
 by the Body Slim Fix cream, which she keeps in her bag and uses after a
 gym sessions, as well as the Bee Sting Mask, which she uses to 
rehydrate her skin and the Glycolic Pads, which she takes to festivals 
with her.  

Sharing her top tips for emulating her fresh glow, Millie explained: 'I love the natural, dewy, bronzed look.'  

Jump for joy: As for her diet, Millie loves to 'dip in and out' of the Honestly Healthy cookbook, an alkaline-based diet loved by Victoria Beckham, and is planning a potential lifestyle book herself

To achieve 
her healthy, sunkissed skin, Millie revealed her arsenal of secret 
weapons, which includes Chantecaille tinted moisturiser, Charlotte 
Tilbury bronzer, NARS multiple stick, Laura Mercier concealer, Urban 
Decay lipgloss and, of course, her own false lashes (her current 
favourite are the Mayfair ones, which she's wearing in the campaign 
imagery).

Aside from fashion, Millie has a huge passion for healthy living and is a walking advert
 for a healthy lifestyle - just one look at her Instagram feed confirms 
she is a huge advocate of work-outs and superfoods.

Speaking about her exercise regime, 
she said: 'I do more walking than running, but I'll do ten short sprints
 if I can be bothered. I love Barrecore, which is a fusion of ballet and
 pilates and is very good for core strength.

'I
 also work out at the Skinny B**** Collective once or twice a week and 
go along with my girlfriends, which makes it more of a fun activity and 
we grab food after.'

As for
 her diet, she loves to 'dip in and out' of the Honestly Healthy 
cookbook, an alkaline-based diet loved by Victoria Beckham.

She said: 'I do an alkaline cleanse if I feel like I've overindulged and it makes me feel more energised.

'I
 avoid anything fried, processed or dairy but I enjoy whatever I want at
 the weekend and absolutely love salted caramel ice cream.'

Millie is currently channeling her 
love of cooking into her new role in Masterchef. 'It was so stressful 
and I often thought "Why have I done this to myself". I've learnt loads 
though and there's plenty of skills I'll take forever.

Big fan: Rodial founder Maria Hatzistefanis, front, said: 'Millie is amazing, she's so happy and very easy going. I am very impressed with her and love her edgy style'

Millie
 is so into cooking that she's even been in talks to launch her own 
book. 'It would have to be a lifestyle book rather than just a cookbook 
though,' she said.

Since leaving Made In Chelsea, the E4 show that sky-rocketed her to fame, Millie Mackintosh has seen her star rise.

She may only be 24 but she's already fronted countless campaigns, launched her own eyelashes range and married a world-famous musician.

In between fronting beauty campaigns 
and cooking up a storm in Masterchef, Millie says she and husband 
Stephen - aka Professor Green - have been busy moving house and 
renovating it. Oh, and she's even managed to design her own clothing 
range in between all of that.

'It
 will be launching in September and it's been six months in the 
planning. We are currently working on the website and it will be stocked
 in one major retailer, but that's all I can say,' she revealed.

Flawless! Millie Mackintosh is fronting yet another beauty campaign, this time it's Nip & Fab. FEMAIL caught up with the former Made In Chelsea star to find out her plans for world domination

Fighting fit: Millie works out at the Skinny B**** Collective once or twice a week and goes along with her girlfriends and they grab food after, which, she says, makes it more of a fun activity
