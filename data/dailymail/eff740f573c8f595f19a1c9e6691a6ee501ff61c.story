Louis van Gaal believes Luke Shaw has returned from the World Cup unfit for Barclays Premier League football.

Shaw, 19, trained on his own at Washington Redskins’ FedEx Field on Monday night as Van Gaal put the rest of the Manchester United squad through ball drills.

Asked at a post-training press conference why Shaw worked alone, United manager Van Gaal said: 'I am always a trainer who sees the individuals and what each player needs.

'Luke needs to be fit and he’s not very fit and can’t perform how I want. He needs to be fit and to train individually.

'I can’t judge why. I see what I see. I have spoken with him and we have made a programme with him.

'He has agreed. We will have to see how long it takes. I don’t know.

'I have heard good messages from Tony Strudwick the fitness coach.'

Shaw
 joined up with United for the first time since his £27million move from 
Southampton three weeks after England were knocked out of the World Cup.

Fellow
 England players Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Phil Jones are all 
deemed to be ahead of Shaw in the fitness stakes and they all worked 
with main squad ahead of Tuesday night’s game against Inter Milan here in Washington.

Van Gaal also had a message for wide man Wilfried Zaha.

The
 young winger is the only United player not to have figured on tour yet 
and has been told he must make his future at the club as a striker if he
 is to fit in with Van Gaal’s 3-5-2 system.

The United boss said: 'He will have to play as a striker as he can’t play the other positions in the system.

'Ashley Young can play as a wing-back. Zaha cannot do that so he will be a striker.

'I have spoken with him and I think he can do it. We will see.

'He will play the second 45 minutes of this game and will play as a striker.'

The
 Dutchman also quashed rumours of a move from Inter Milan for Mexico 
striker Javier Hernandez, who is training with the United squad after coming 
back from the World Cup.

Asked
 about the link with the Italian club, Van Gaal added: 'I don’t know 
anything about that. You would need to wait for an announcement from us 
but I can't say anything about that.'

The
 new United boss surprised many by naming Tom Cleverley as captain in 
the 3-2 win against Roma, but he insists the reason behind the bold move
 was because the midfielder was playing the full 90 minutes in 
Denver.

He
 said: 'They are just the ones who play 90 minutes. Cleverley played 90 
minutes in the second game so he was captain. Maybe Chris Smalling will 
be captain tomorrow because he is going to play 90.'

With
 United adopting a 3-5-2 formation for the tour, Van Gaal insists he 
will not try a back four for the remainder of pre-season, because the 
team know the 'old' system and can easily revert back if necessary.

'It’s difficult to change the systems. We don’t have time for that.

'There
 is only three weeks before the season so I have to use every session 
play and practice that system. They know the old system anyway so I 
don’t need to do that.
