Manchester United stars turned Father Christmas as they arrived at a local hospital bearing sacks of presents for the sick children.

Players including Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Angel di Maria arrived by club coach carrying United branded gift bags before posing for pictures and speaking to youngsters on the wards.

Darren Fletcher, Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were also on hand to give the children a day they will not forget as part of the club's annual Christmas visit.

Goalkeeper David de Gea was another player pleased to give something back to the community within 24hours of starring for United in their 3-0 victory over Liverpool.

The Spaniard has arguably been the former champions best player this season and won another man-of-the match award on Sunday after keeping a clean sheet with a succession of world class saves to deny the likes of Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling.

Louis van Gaal's side have now won six consecutive league games to move into third place and reignite hopes of a title challenge after a slow start to the season.
