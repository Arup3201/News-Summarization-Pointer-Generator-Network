If you have ever watched a child using an iPad with expertise eclipsing that of some adults, you may be forgiven for thinking young people are more tech savvy than ever before.

But one engineer has dubbed young people a ‘lost generation’, incapable of fixing gadgets and appliances because they have grown up in a disposable world.

Danielle George from  University of Manchester said people under the age of 40 expect gadgets to ‘just work’ and consequently are useless if they go wrong, replacing them with new devices instead of mending them.

The professor of Radio Frequency Engineering is giving this year’s prestigious Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in London.

She claims most devices can be mended or repurposed with just a little knowledge of engineering and electronics and hopes to inspire television viewers who watch her lectures called: ‘Sparks will fly: How to hack your home’ to make, do and mend.

In the lecture series, beginning tonight at 8pm on BBC Four, Professor George will examine three British inventions - the light bulb, a telephone and a motor.

She will then show viewers how to transform them into extraordinary things, using everyday objects, as well as 3D printers, new materials and coding.

The light bulb moment: Airs tonight, December 29, at 8pm pm BBC Four

Professor Danielle George will attempt to play a computer game on the windows of a skyscraper using hundreds of light bulbs.

She explain how this is possible and show viewers how to send wireless messages using a barbecue, control a firework display with their your laptop and use a torch to browse the internet.

Making contact: Airs on December 30 at 8pm, BBC Four

Inspired by Alexander Graham Bell, Professor George will try to beam a special guest into the theatre via hologram, using the technology found in a mobile phone.

She will show viewers how to control paintball cannons with a webcam and turn their smartphone into a microscope, while also investigating a device that allows people to feel invisible objects in mid-air.

A new revolution: Airs on December 31 at 8pm, BBC Four

Dr George will attempt to use simple motors to build a worldclass robot orchestra.

She will explain how these robotic and motor-driven appliances work and show how they can adapted to help us kick start a technological revolution as well as showing viewers how to turn a washing machine into a wind turbine, how Lego can solve a Rubik’s Cube and how the next Mars rover will traverse an alien world.

Professor George told The Telegraph: ‘We’ve got a lost generation that has grown up with factory electronics that just work all of the time. 

‘All of these things in our home do seem to work most of the time and because they don’t break we just get used to them.

Professor Danielle George is an Associate Dean for Teaching and Learning in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of Manchester and a Professor of Radio Frequency Engineering.

Her first degree was in Astrophysics and she then did a Masters in Radio Astronomy and PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

She was a Senior Electrical Engineer at Jodrell Bank Observatory until 2006.

Professor George first became interested in engineering when she was given a telescope by her parents aged eight.

'I would get up in the middle of the night to watch lunar eclipses. It was the first time I realised how mathematics and physics could be used in a practical and useful way and I knew immediately that this kind of hands-on investigation was what I wanted to do in life,' she said.

She now focuses on designing, testing and constructing instrumentation used in radio frequency and microwave communications systems by helping to design devices that transmit and receive huge volumes of information using radio waves, which is how mobile phones operate, or the much shorter microwaves, which is how satellite and deep space communications work.

She is following in the footsteps of Michael Faraday and David Attenborough by giving the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures.

‘They have almost become like Black Boxes which never die. 

'And when they do we throw them away and buy something new.’

However, she said there is an emerging community of people that enjoy remaking and repurposing things, such as a man who uses LEDs on his bike to write messages to motorists.

She hopes young people will realise that they can change the world by inventing new devices. 

And there has never been a better time, because technology is improving at an incredible rate and many components and gadgets are relatively cheap, she added.

'Today’s generation of young people are in a truly unique position. They have never been more equipped to be creative and innovative,' she said in a blog post.

'I want young people to realise that they have the power to change the world from their own bedroom, kitchen table or garden shed.

'If we all take control of the technology around us and think creatively, then solving some of the world’s greatest challenges is only a small step away. 

'I believe everyone has the potential to be an inventor.'

It was a present of a telescope from her parents at the age of eight that first made Professor George appreciate how maths and physics can be used in a practical way.

Gail Cardew, Director of Science and Education at the Royal Institution said: ‘Our aim is to bring to life the incredible ingenuity, innovation and creativity of engineering.’

The lectures, which were started in 1825 by Michael Faraday, have been taken by scientists including astronomer Carl Sagan and Sir David Attenborough.

Professor George's first lecture, which is inspired by Geordie inventor Joseph Swan who is most famous for inventing the incandescent light bulb, will see her playing a computer game on the windows of a skyscraper using hundreds of light bulbs. 

She will also show viewers how to send wireless messages using a barbecue, control a firework display with a laptop. and use a torch to browse the internet.

In following lectures, she will attempt to beam a holographic special guest to the theatre in London, using a smartphone, and use simple motors to make a robot orchestra.

Other ‘how-tos’ will include how to turn a washing machine into a wind turbine, how Lego can solve a Rubik’s Cube, and how the next Mars rover will traverse an alien world.

The first of this year’s lectures airs tonight on BBC Four at 8pm, with three more following until New Year’s Eve.

Despite saying most people under the age of 40 haven't got a clue how to fix electronic devices and appliances, she said there is an emerging community of people that enjoy remaking and repurposing things and will show how coding (illustrated) and new technologies can be used to invent new objects, in her lecture

This is because they've grown up in a disposable society, meaning they simply buy new devices rather than fix the old ones
