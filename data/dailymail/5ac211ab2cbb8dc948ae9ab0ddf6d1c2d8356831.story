Soured: Jamie Oliver - thought to be worth £150million - and wife Jools

Jamie Oliver is pulling the plug on his signature range of artisan food amid multi-million pound  losses and bitter criticism from  his suppliers.

Reputed to be the world’s richest chef with a personal fortune of £150 million, Mr Oliver launched his ‘Jme’ food range amid great fanfare two years ago.

The collection of sauces, biscuits and jams were said to be a ground-breaking collaboration between the TV cook and a hand-picked group  of independent, small-scale food producers in Britain and Italy.

But despite being stocked in over 150 retailers, poor sales have left Jme owing parent group Jamie Oliver Ltd £14 million – some £6 million of which is unlikely to be repaid.

Jme made losses of £3.8 million in 2012, double its deficit of £1.9 million the year before.

Mr Oliver is to discontinue the range by the end of the year. 

Suppliers and wholesalers confirmed they were sent an email informing them the line was ending, leading some producers to attack Jme’s ‘commercial ineptitude’ and ‘poor branding’.

One producer claims he is still owed money by Jme and said his final dealings with the business had left a ‘sour taste’ in his mouth.

‘We had a lot of difficulties with them,’ said Gary Reid, of shortbread bakers Reids of Caithness.

‘I’m not going to be harsh on Jamie Oliver because the failure is down to his team. I’m still sitting on about £1,000 of packaging they wanted that I’ll never get reimbursed for.’ Mr Reid accused the chef’s business associates of being ‘unprofessional’ and described many of the decisions made by those in charge of the Jme brand as ‘commercial madness’.

‘To be honest, I’m not surprised the range has been cut,’ he added. ‘It turned out to be a really poor business. Many of their buyers ignored top-quality importers who wanted to take our products on abroad.

‘It’s such a shame because the brand had such potential. I’ve been so furious about it.

‘We made some money from it,  but 
we’ve also lost money from it. It’s not good when high-profile brands 
are doing that to small businesses.’

Another
supplier, who preferred to remain anonymous said: ‘I’m not surprised at
all the range did not do well. They had no idea about the commercial 
world. It was ridiculous. By the end I was pulling my hair out.’

Discontinued: A range of products from JME Foods - which made significant losses and will be discontinued by the end of the year

The group is also to withdraw Jme homeware from stores, although the products will still be marketed through direct selling parties in individuals’ homes, and online. A spokesman for Mr Oliver last night confirmed that the foods range would  be discontinued from 2014, but added: ‘The food was always a very small part of what the Jme range offers.

‘It was decided the  focus should be on the bigger, more successful, homewares range sold through direct selling  and online.

‘We are not aware of owing any suppliers money but if they would like to approach us directly as opposed to through the media, the Jme team will investigate.’
