Urban Outfitters' recent claim to be the leading seller of vinyl has been found to be false.

Billboard says that the title actually belongs to Amazon, after surveying music labels, distributors and wholesalers that account for roughly 80per cent of the U.S. market.

Last week, the retailer's Chief Administrative Officer Calvin Hollinger said in a meeting of Wall Street analysts: 'Music is very, very important to the Urban customer … in fact, we are the world’s number one vinyl seller.'

According to Billboard's analysis, Amazon is actually the largest vinyl seller in the U.S. with a 12.3per cent market share, while Urban Outfitters trails behind with an 8.1per cent share.

Hastings Entertainment has a 2.8per cent share, while Hot Topic follows with 2.4per cent of the market.

Alliance Entertainment, a wholesaler that sells to chains such as Best Buy and Barnes & Noble, also has a significant share of the vinyl business.

And in the U.S., independent record stores account for approximately 50per cent of all vinyl sales.

'Independent retailers are still the backbone of vinyl's growth, and they are still selling tons of it,' one major label distribution executive said.

'Indies are driving the format's growth and everyone else is picking up on what they do.'

Urban Outfitters has been the subject of other recent controversies.

In September, the store was forced to apologize for selling a blood-stained 'vintage' Kent State sweatshirt, in what appeared to be a reference to the massacre of 1970. 

In July, the store pulled a duvet cover featuring the religious deity Lord Ganesh from its stores after observant Hindus took offense at the item, saying its design was not meant to be slept on.

And in June, critics blasted the retailer for stocking pens shaped like heroin-filled needles.
