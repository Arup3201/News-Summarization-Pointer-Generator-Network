This is the dramatic moment a devoutly Christian couple who went on the run with their children after losing custody of them were finally tracked down - and the mother was arrested for 'attacking police'.

Erica Carey, 29, and Cleve Goheen-Rengo, 23, were spotted in California on Thursday, more than a week after they fled with their twin babies and toddler son from their Washington state home.

When police arrived at a Santa Cruz gas station that the couple had been sighted at, they discovered the youngsters - twins Moran Kai and Daniel and one-year-old Levi - unharmed.

However, when Child Protective Services (CPS) workers arrived to take the children into protective custody, Carey allegedly lashed out, kicking and headbutting officers while begging Jesus for help.

She was quickly arrested, but not before she had screamed at a local cameraman: 'Send a message to America for me. Children don't belong to the government. The government belongs to the people.'

Her partner was not arrested, while her children - who had reportedly been underfed and deprived of proper medical care by the couple, who live a 'holistic Christian lifestyle' - were handed to the CPS.

Officials arrived at Carey and Goheen-Rengo's Bellingham home on January 28 to take Moran Kai, Daniel and Levi into protective custody amid serious health concerns, according to KSBW.

But on arrival, they discovered the couple - who hit headlines last year after saying they lost custody of their twins for delivering them via homebirth with no assistance - had fled with their children.

Their escape was not deemed a criminal kidnapping nor an Amber Alert investigation. Instead, it was considered a civil violation involving the defiance of CPS court orders, it is reported.

A 'Be On The Lookout' warning was issued to police across the West Coast, while local news outlets also ran the notice. This led to a member of the public recognizing family at the gas station.

On Thursday, highway patrol and Santa Cruz County Sheriff's deputies stormed the gas station, where they found the fugitive couple and their children. They then called the CPS to the scene.

When social workers arrived, Carey allegedly became enraged, headbutting a California Highway Patrol (CHS) sergeant and kicking a deputy, while screaming obscenities and praying to Jesus.

'She head-butted one of our sergeants and kicked a sheriff's deputy,' CHP Officer Brad Sadek said.

Carey was then arrested. She has since been charged with refusing to cooperate with law enforcement, resisting arrest, and battery on an officer, according to rawstory.com.

Speaking to the site, a CHP spokesman said he could understand why Carey was so upset. 

'We feel for their plight,' said Brad Sadek. 'As often as we seem like machines following orders, it still can be emotionally jarring for us too.'

The officer added: 'We’re human beings. Everyone out there has kids of their own. We wanted to make it as comfortable for those kids as we would want for our own kids.'

Mr Sadek said social workers and police had attempted to comfort the children during the incident.

The couple's children had previously been removed from their home last November following the twins' birth one month earlier, amid reports they were underweight with improper medical care.

Carey and Goheen-Rengo claimed their refusal to travel to hospital with paramedics - called to the house after a neighbor called 911 over Carey's birthing cries - contributed to the CPS decision.

However, the state denied this, saying the children were removed for health and domestic reasons, including the couple's apparent refusal to treat Levi's eczema with proper medication. 

'[Social workers] wanted the authority in my household,' Goheen-Rengo said. 'I told them, "I’m a Christian and God gave me the authority in my household".' 

Carey and Goheen-Rengo live a self-proclaimed 'holistic lifestyle based on their Christian beliefs',The Billingham Herald reported. 

Unconventional: Carey and Goheen-Rengo (seen together) are common-law married in Washington because they have never got a marriage license

The couple - who conceived Levi just hours after first meeting each another -  only realized they were having twins after the birth of the first baby in October, having not had one ultrasound.

They were handed back their children in December, but they were still under state protection, so would be checked upon regularly. Carey and Goheen-Rengo were also made to undergo counseling.

At the time, Commissioner Thomas Verge told the couple that their religious beliefs had caused a chaotic home life for their children. He added that if the state believed the children's lives were in danger again they would be removed. 

'This is about second chances because you blew the first one,' said Verge to the couple according to The Herald. But Mr Verge also pointed out he could see the 'love you both have for your children.'

When the CPS heard the children had been returned, they said, 'We accept this ruling and will work with the family to provide them with services aimed at helping keep the children safe in their home.' 

During the case which was heard in court in December, the state 'attempted to show an unstable household marked by numerous contacts with law enforcement … within the past two years and refusal to provide medical treatment to the children,' according to the Herald. 

It was only after the couple, who are common-law married in Washington because they have never got a marriage license, decided to have their home birth that the CPS became involved.

'I’ve done a lot of research about other women who have done it and they said the spiritual experience was so much more wholesome. It was just us. We wanted to preserve that sanctity and sacredness in our birth,' said Carey as she justified her decision to give birth at home.

The CPS began showing up at their home after the 911 call in November and said that after they took custody of the children after  Levi developed pneumonia and ear infections.

Assistant Attorney General Rob Olson told the Washington court that officials have been in contact with the couple 21 times since 2013 over their apparent refusal to provide proper medical care.

He said law enforcement had concerns that the children were underweight. They were also worried about domestic issues between the couple, such as Rengo's mental health and bipolar disorder.

However, Christina Nelson-King, the attorney for the couple argued that 'Most of the safety risk was primarily speculative,' according to the Herald.

'Parents have a Constitutional right to parent as they see fit,' Nelson-King added. But he criticized them for their attitude towards the CPS which he said was doing its job properly.

'They did exactly what they should do,' he said, adding they tried everything to help the family and were met by resistance. 'Their lives are dedicated to children. They are not the enemy. They are the heroes.'

Washingon Governor, Jay Inslee waded into the controversial case  to recognize the support the Rengo family received last year.

'I want to thank you for your concern and willingness to be vocal,' said Governor Jay Inslee on his official Facebook page.

The Governor also sought to clarify any rumors surrounding the removal of the children by social services. 'I’d like to be clear: every child’s safety is our top priority in situations like these,' he said.

'Rumors have circulated that the removal of the Rengo children was due to breastfeeding or their home births. Those rumors are false.

'Breastfeeding and home birthing are not factors that would cause CPS to take children from a home. Their removal from the home was based on factors unrelated to a home birth or breastfeeding.'
