Too much on his plate? Gregg Wallace has suffered a series of business setbacks

His personal life is in disarray after he drunkenly attacked a fan at a five-course dinner.

Now Gregg Wallace’s professional affairs have also come under strain as the hotel chain that hosted the event has dropped his restaurant from another of its luxury hotels.

The MasterChef judge will close Gregg’s Bar and Grill, in London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel, following a series of scathing reviews by critics who branded it a 'travesty' and a 'joke'.

The premises are run by Bespoke Hotels, which also owns the four-star Wood Norton Hotel near Evesham, Worcestershire, where Wallace was involved in Saturday’s brawl.

The 48-year-old punched magazine publisher Paul Bates while hosting a £75-a-head question-and-answer session.

Wallace claimed Bates had fondled the bottom of his 27-year-old girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini.

A
source close to Wallace said: ‘Gregg wanted to…concentrate on other 
business interests.’

The restaurant had a rocky start when it was set up in February last year receiving poor reviews.

It went through a major rebrand just months later

Originally named Gregg’s Table, the restaurant was forced to appoint a new head chef just two months after opening its doors.

Its offerings of ‘good, honest food’ - inspired by 1970s British classics such as avocado prawn and Chicken Kiev - proved unpopular with critics and diners alike, who found it hard to justify the £80 per head cost of a meal.

Meanwhile, Wallace blamed the collapse of Secretts Direct on catastrophic farming conditions, adding: ‘It is really disappointing. Everyone knows how close the greengrocer business has been to my heart – it put me on the path to where I am today.’

He added: ‘I’m still a greengrocer. I supply restaurants in London. I’m a very good salesman. I could sell sand to the Arabs.’

Mr Wallace also runs a café and brasserie in Putney, west London, called Wallace & Co.

Yesterday, a spokesmen for Gregg Wallace and the Bermondsey Square Hotel issued a joint statement: ‘As was always the case and both parties had discussed over a month ago, the two-year agreement with Gregg Wallace at Bermondsey Square is coming to a natural end later this year.

‘There is no change to this arrangement and any suggestion to the contrary would be entirely unfounded.'
