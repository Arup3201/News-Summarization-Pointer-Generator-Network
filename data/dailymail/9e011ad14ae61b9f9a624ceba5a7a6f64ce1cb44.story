For all of James Milner’s qualities — smart movement, a neat first touch and the stamina of a long-distance runner — he is without a Premier League goal in a year.

Milner has featured in 30 top-flight fixtures since he last found the net in a 4-2 win at Fulham 365 days ago.

It is, therefore, testament to the esteem that he is held in by Manuel Pellegrini that he was trusted to lead the line amid a spate of injuries that have decimated Manchester City’s strike force, with Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all out of contention.

City, for their part, do not view it as the crisis that others might. Jovetic will be fit sooner rather than later, and the club have no intention of recalling their most promising young forwards Marcos Lopes and Devante Cole from Lille or Barnsley respectively.

It must also be taken in the context of a resurgent run that has seen City win eight wins in a row and draw level with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. City see little benefit in disrupting the fine progress that two of their most talented young forwards are making elsewhere for the sake of the short-term and Pellegrini is relaxed about the prospect of fielding Milner at the tip of his team.

‘I picked Milner there because he is a player who works really hard, creates a lot of movement and spaces,’ Pellegini explained after the 3-0 win over Crystal Palace.

In James Milner, Pellegrini knew he had the perfect sacrificial lamb.

A quick brainstorm reveals that Milner has now played up to seven positions in a Manchester City shirt - in both full-back positions, across the midfield, behind the frontman and now as an old-fashioned No 9.

It would be an exaggeration to say that the Milner plan was bulletproof and in truth, it is an experiment that did not entirely convince in a first-half in which a direct Palace side provoked anxiety among the Etihad crowd.
