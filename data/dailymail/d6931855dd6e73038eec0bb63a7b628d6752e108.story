While relations between England and India may have sunk below basic standards of civility, the teams are at least united by one common issue – do they have a specialist spinner good enough to play in the next Test?

India, in particular, may reflect with some regret on how they lacked the confidence to select a frontline slow bowler to exploit helpful conditions in the series opener at Trent Bridge.

After predictions of rain and swing at the English bowlers’ favourite venue, they were instead greeted by baking sunshine and a groundsman apologising for producing the type of flat track more readily found in Nagpur than Nottingham.

Negative spin: Ravichandran Ashwin (centre) is India's best slow bowler but has a poor record away from home

It was only when a few clouds appeared for a mere hour or so on the last morning that we saw significant ball movement and an Indian batting wobble. Then the sun reappeared and the game resumed on its ponderous path to an inevitable draw.

The pace bowlers on both sides toiled manfully in the circumstances, but if this is what we can expect for the rest of the series – and the forecast is for a heatwave in the opening days at Lord’s – then just imagine the havoc that could be wreaked by a skilled spinner.

It is fair to ask how the land of twirlers and tweakers and doyens of the doosra can find itself in the same predicament as England in scratching around for such a man?

How can the country that regularly used to field an attack of four spin bowlers now find itself unable to select even one of them to help the seamers?

Well, there is one actually. His name is Ravichandran Ashwin and he reached 100 Test wickets quicker than any bowler in Indian history.

Turning it on: Ashwin reached 100 Test wickets faster than any other Indian bowler in history

The 27-year-old has nine five-fors from only 18 Tests, and boasts an impressive array of variations beyond his stock off-spinner. He can even bowl the carrom ball, which is flicked out between the thumb and a bent middle finger (anyone who has played the Indian board game of the same name will understand why it is so called).

There’s just one problem. Only nine of his 104 Test wickets were taken away from the dustbowls of India.

Net gain: Ashwin, pictured in practice ahead of the first Test, is surely worth a place in India's team for Lord's

He was selected for just one of the four Tests that India played in South Africa and New Zealand last winter, when he went wicketless at Johannesburg while conceding 108 runs.

While he has taken his wickets at 28.5 runs apiece overall, his figures are severely tarnished by a bowling average of 75 away from home. Hence the concerns over selecting him in England.

But there is no doubt he is the best that India have got. And with the prospect of a long hot summer on the cards and six left-handers in the English team who won’t like the ball spinning away from their bat, it is surely time to change tack.

India’s batsman have shown they can be comfortable in these conditions, and it is encouraging that the bulk of the runs at Trent Bridge came from unheralded sources like the opener Murali Vijay rather than the acknowledged stars Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara.

Meanwhile the seam bowlers, while a little slower than their English counterparts and even less capable of taking the last wicket, were at least able to bowl some probing lines and lengths as well as extracting a little ball movement. Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, in particular, showed in the first innings that they can make inroads into this English batting line-up.

All they needed was a proper spinner to put on a different type of pressure at the other end. Although the Indian camp has been quick to justify its selection in the first Test, and there are signs they may remain loyal to same XI for now, it would be foolish to delay Ashwin’s introduction for too long.

In danger: Ashwin could replace Stuart Binny (left) or Ravindra Jadeja (right) - or India could play two spinners

Ashwin's Test bowling record:

Tests: 19 Wickets: 104 Best bowling (inns):  7/103  Best bowling (match): 12/85 Average: 28.50 5wkt inns: 9 10wkt match: 2

The all-rounder Stuart Binny, whose innocuous up-and-down medium pacers only took up 10 out of the 145 overs India bowled at Trent Bridge, is the obvious candidate to make way. Such a move may seem harsh after his disciplined 65 helped see out the draw on the last day, but he offers no more with the bat than Ashwin – who can boast two Test centuries and a batting average nudging 40.

The other option would be to leave out the spinning all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who may be a recognised top order batsman in Indian conditions but looked less comfortable than Binny when wielding the willow at Nottingham.

The great factor in his favour, however, is that his left-arm spin dovetails nicely with that of Ashwin, who turns the ball the other way.

Pitching an idea: India could go with two spinners at Lord's, no matter what the track looks like

With favourable conditions, playing the pair of them represents the best chance for India to close out a game over this long five-match series. They have won countless matches over the years through their tried and tested method of triggering a second innings collapse by crowding the bat with close fielders, incessant chatter and over-optimistic appealing.

It doesn’t matter if the pitch is not entirely responsive at Lord’s, or if this tactic does not yield immediate dividends.

This is simply what India do. It is in their DNA. They always do it back home and it is time to show the conviction to try it here.

However, just nine of his 104 Test wickets have been away from home

Ashwin could come in for Stuart Binny or Ravindra Jadeja
