A wheelchair user has attempted to 'Race The Tube' in a bid to raise awareness of London Underground access for disabled people.

Anthony Ince was inspired by Londoner Jason Heptonstall's video in which viewers watched as he raced a Circle Line train, and won.

The 43-year-old cerebral palsy-sufferer filmed the footage as he embarked on a similar challenge, racing 380 metres from Mansion House to the next stop - Cannon Street. 

Race The Tube: Wheelchair user Anthony Ince films his own challenge across London

Anthony attempted to race the Circle Line the 380 metres from Mansion House to Cannon Street station

In the footage, Londoner Mr Ince can be seen attempting to beat the train in just one minute 20 seconds.

All is going well as he races his wheelchair off the Tube, through the ticket barrier, out of Mansion House and along the streets to Cannon Street.

The video then cuts to the train Mr Ince is attempting to race against, as it pulls up at the station.

Mr Ince would be in good time to make the Tube, however, he is confronted by a flight of stairs.

Along with The Free Help Guy, Anthony recorded this video to raise awareness of the lack of step-free access

The video shows Mr Ince, who teamed up with blog The Free Help Guy for the challenge, sitting at the top of the stairs as the train leaves the station.  

The message on the footage says: 'Dear TFL, Please do more to help Anthony and other wheelchair users to take the London Underground. (Let alone race it).'

It also claims that 75 per cent of Underground stations in London do not have step-free access at this time.

Challenge: Mr Ince attempting to Race The Tube - and highlight the lack of step-free access at stations 

The Free Help Guy writes on his blog: 'Mansion House, for example, is out of bounds for wheelchair users as it has many steps and no lifts (though the eagle eyed amongst you will notice we gave ourselves a bit of creative freedom during filming to try and illustrate the issue!).

'Whilst Transport for London, the organisation responsible for this issue across the capital, isn't ignoring the need to implement step-free access across stations, the 25 per cent figure they've reached to date is still a painfully small one.'

He added: 'For Anthony, and many others in his situation, taking a simple journey across town involves a huge amount of planning, detours, time and effort. 

'I feel like us wheelchair users are being ignored,' Anthony writes of the TFL system

'Again, TFL have resources to help this journey planning - but getting your head around some of them is no easy task.'

Anthony also wrote on the blog: 'I tend to just use buses. It's too difficult to know where I can and can't get to when I take the Tube.

'It feels like us wheelchair users are being ignored, despite how positively London came across during the Paralympics in 2012.'
