Liverpool have reportedly expressed interest in Marseille central midfielder Mario Lemina, according to reports in France.

L'Equipe claims that Brendan Rodger's side has 'enquired' about the 21-year old Gabonese-born French player, although specific details over the potential transfer have been kept to a minimum. 

Lemina arrived at Marseille for 4m Euros in 2013 and has a contract with the Ligue 1 club until 2018, meaning the Reds would have to pay a sizeable fee to complete a deal for the defensive midfielder who has made a single appearance for France's Under-21s.

Meanwhile, Zinedine Zidane has been discussing everything Real Madrid in an interview with Spanish daily AS. The World Cup winner and Los Blancos coach insists that Cristiano Ronaldo will win more Ballon d'Or awards than his nemesis Lionel Messi - after the Portuguese picked up a third golden globe last week.

Zidane also believes that much maligned striker Karim Benzema 'always does the right thing for the team', but reserved highest praise for Spain international midfielder Isco, who he claims 'reminds me of myself'.

The World Cup winning legend also says that Real Madrid playmaker Isco reminds him of himself

Mundo Deportivo pays homage to 'Mister Hatrick' aka Messi who netted his 30th treble for Barcelona against Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday - reminding readers that the Argentinian now leads Ronaldo 33-30 if his three international hat-tricks are included.

While Marca keeps its Real Madrid readers content with an interview from coach Carlo Ancelotti claiming|: 'To coach Madrid is the easiest thing in the world', there are also reports of Chinese magnate Wang Jianlin increasing his share in Atletico Madrid to 20 per cent.

The Italian press is focused on two stories - firstly, Juventus' attempts to keep star midfielder Paul Pogba away from the clutches of Real Madrid.

The Turin club's director general Guiseppe Marotta told Tuttosport: 'I think Paul will stay, we have the strength to refuse any offer even if it will be hard for him to say no to some wages.'

However, La Gazetta dello Sport, have perhaps gauged the situation more pragmatically with the headline: 'Juve's crazy idea, keeping Pogba'.

Finally, former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi appears to have deflected attention from his own troubles by laying in to AC Milan and, in particular coach Pippo Inzaghi, claiming: 'It’s unacceptable to lose to a team which earns one fifth what our players do,' in reference to the Rossoneri's recent 1-0 defeat to Atalanta.
