Silva was heard telling Aldo over the phone: 'Dude, you have to finish him (McGregor). He’s such a douche bag.'

The Brazilian defender continued: 'He’s got to fall and never get back up, that mother******.'

Aldo replied: 'What’s up brother, absolutely. I’m going to kill this mother****** and cut his head off.

'That cocky trash talking son of a b****. I’m going to run him over and he won’t even see me. I’m going to release the beast on him. He’s gonna regret it.'
