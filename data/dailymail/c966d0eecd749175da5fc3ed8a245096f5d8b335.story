A man who was left in a New Jersey McDonald's sink when he was just hours old has launched a search for his birth mother after being inspired by the success of the 'Burger King baby'.

David Volk, from Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, didn't even try looking for his mother because he had no information about her - but after Katheryn Deprill posted an image on Facebook explaining that she'd been dumped in a Burger King 27 years ago, it took her just three weeks to find her mother.

Inspired, Volk decided to do the same, and has now shared an image on his Facebook profile showing him holding a sign reading: 'Please help me! I am looking for my birth mother.'

Search: David Volk is looking for the mother who left him in a McDonald's bathroom 36 years ago

'I just never thought there was any 
hope,' he told the Star-Ledger. 'Being abandoned in a McDonald's, no records. After 
seeing [Deprill's] story, and she found her mom so quickly, that's what gave me 
the inspiration to do mine.'

Volk still had his umbilical cord attached when a manager found him wrapped in a brown plastic bag in the sink of the women's restroom in a McDonald's in Newark, New Jersey in December 1977.

He was given the name 'Christopher McDonald' because of where he was found, but his name was legally changed when he was adopted a year later, records show.

Volk, who is now 36 and married, said he developed a close bond with his family and was devastated by the loss of his adoptive mother two years ago.

He said he isn't angry with his birth mother but simply wishes to meet her and get to know her.

New home: He was adopted when he was one but his mother, right, passed away two years ago

'I believe 
she was young, maybe hiding her pregnancy or whatever, and she probably 
didn't have the means to support me, and I believe that she left me 
there for somebody to find me,' he said.

He continued: 'I had a wonderful life, great family 
that treated me well... I'm very 
happy, but I just would like to complete the circle and find my birth 
mother. I believe some things are meant to be.'

Katheryn
 Deprill had success with social media in March this year when she 
posted an image online showing her holding up a sign detailing the 
circumstances of her discovery.

'Looking
 for my birth mother,' it read. 'She abandoned me in the Burger King 
bathroom only hours old, Allentown PA. Please help me find her by 
sharing my post.'

Her birth mother, Kathy Pochek, learned of the Facebook post and contacted her through a lawyer, revealing to her daughter that she had abandoned her following a rape that she hid from her family when she was just 16.

They soon realized they have a long list of things in common - from their names, cars and careers. Bizarrely, Pochek even babysat Deprill's husband when he was a child.

'I have a wonderful family, I would never want to replace them. But being adopted, part of you is missing,' Deprill explained on the Today show alongside her mother and birth mother.
