London Welsh have announced the signing of Cardiff Blues lock James Down.

Down becomes the Exiles' 24th new arrival since they secured promotion to the Aviva Premiership last month.

On the move: London Welsh have signed Cardiff Blues lock James Down for next season

And it will mean the 26-year-old linking up again with London Welsh head coach Justin Burnell, who brought Down into the Blues system while he worked at Cardiff.

'Coming through the Blues system he played alongside the likes of Bradley Davies and Lou Reed, who have both gone on to be full internationals. I still believe James has the potential to do that,' Burnell said.

'He has played a lot of rugby in different competitions with Cardiff Blues, and he's another fantastic addition to our squad.

'I am really pleased to have someone of James' calibre on board, pushing the players already within our squad and helping to add to the competitive edge.'
