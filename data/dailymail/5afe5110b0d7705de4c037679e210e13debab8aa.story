Angel Di Maria is set to be left out of Real Madrid's squad to face city rivals Atletico on Friday, giving further encouragement to Manchester United who are weighing up a £50million  bid for the Argentina World Cup star.

Real contest their second trophy of the season  as they play the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico with the score 1-1 from the first game.

But there is likely to be no Di Maria after tensions between the player and the European champions heightened in the last 24 hours.

Real  supporters have left the club in no doubt that they want Di Maria to stay at the club but president Florentino Perez wants him sold to help the club balance the books after their £95m spending spree this summer bringing in Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez.

The club were embarrassed by the reaction of the Bernabeu on Tuesday when Di Maria came on as a second half substitute and was given a huge ovation by supporters. On Thursday coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed the player had turned down the offer of a new contract and asked for a move.

But Di Maria's new deal would only have seen him bring £4m next year and he wants parity with those who are in the second tier of Real's wage structure and earn £6m  net a season.

Supporters who saw him play a huge role in the Champions League success last season believe he is worth it but the club have made no second offer and he will be a United player if they find the money to meet both Real's asking price and the player's wage demands.

Catalan paper Sport suggests Barcelona have made a £48m  bid for Di Maria but  midfielder Xavi has dismissed the idea.

The Nou Camp talisman believes the idea of Di Maria switching between Spain's big two clubs, just like Luis Figo did in swapping Barcelona for Real in 2000, just wouldn't happen.

'He's a great player but it is very rare that that happens,' Xavi said. 

A fans' poll on Sport's website revealed 80 percent of Barca fans wanting the unlikely swoop to take place and Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said on Tuesday that he is 'Real Madrid's best player'.

It seems everyone bar the Real board want the Argentina star. What remains to be seen is if United want him enough and can persuade him to give up Champions League football for a season.
