A team of seven police officers take the strain as they lift a tranquilised 300lb black bear onto a truck in a New Jersey suburb.

Officials were forced to take action after the large male animal was spotted wandering through the outskirts of Delran, in Burlington County - near Philadelphia.

The defiant bear clung onto a tree for 30 minutes after being shot with a tranquiliser dart yesterday near the busy Route 130.

The bear had been spotted wandering through the county during the past week, but the authorities decided to finally bring its adventure to an end as it moved towards the outskirts of Philadelphia.

The animal was shown eventually sliding down the tree after being shot with a tranquilizer dart before eventually falling into a net around 9.30am, the Camden Courier Post reports.

The three-year-old male is to be 
moved to the Brendan Byrne State Forest in the Pinelands.

The bear is believed to be the same one seen during the past week in areas including Maple Shade, Westampton, Moorestown and Mount Laurel, according to the Courier.

The animal has a history of wandering into heavily populated areas. Last year it roamed into Vineland, New Jersey, and was moved to the Wharton State Forest.

It was originally hoped the animal was going to make its own way back to the woods after the latest sightings.

Black bears currently live in much of the northeastern US, the northern midwest, the Rocky mountain region, the west coast and in Alaska.Â
