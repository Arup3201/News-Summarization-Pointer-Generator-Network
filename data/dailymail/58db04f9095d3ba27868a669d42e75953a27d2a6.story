He often gets mistaken for American DJ Steve Aoki so when Jarrad Seng heard the festival headliner was coming to Perth he decided to spend three hours impersonating him - with hilarious results.

It's a case of mistaken identity for the 26-year-old, who has spent the last five years being compared to his doppelgänger at music festivals, bars, on Instagram and even on the streets of Barcelona.

Since the photographer from Perth already shares Aoki’s trademark scraggly long black hair – he thought it would be a brilliant idea to get his friends together to give him the complete DJ makeover.

Meet Jarrad Seng, from Perth - who has been mistaken for American DJ Steve Aoki for the past five years

'I get called Steve a lot, especially since I work as a photographer in the music industry', Seng told Daily Mail Australia.

'People already yell out 'it's Steve Aoki' on the streets when I'm not even trying to look like him so the idea clicked in my head after I saw the New York catcall video the other week.

'I thought if I deliberately dress like Steve and get a fake beard - I would have a pretty high chance that people would think it's him.

The video shows Seng strolling around Claremont Showground in Perth on Sunday - the second day of Stereosonic - before being approached by festival goers for a ‘selfie’ or group photo.

'The funniest moment was when the real Steve started his set on stage and just the look on people's faces - they were confused when I walked past them and one guy had to double check and he even asked me why I wasn't on stage.

'I even did a crowd surf when Steve was playing and he pointed at me a few times.'

Confused festival goers start questioning Seng when they realise the REAL Steve Aoki is playing on stage

Donning a baseball jacket, an Indian feather headdress, a pair of sunnies and finishing the look with a fake beard, Seng kept excited fans fooled at the music festival.

'I couldn't decide which outfit to wear - Steve's a crazy character so I set my friends up to bring along some crazy outfits to wear,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I had to line up for a while so I could get change in the portaloo - and I had to keep my head down because I was getting a lot of comments.

'I knew that I would do this for a while so I wanted to make the most of it and I had to buy the stereo ticket to make this happen - it was the first ticket I bought in a really long time - so I had to go all out.'

When Aoki hit the stage, more festivalgoers were fooled and confused as to why the DJ was part of the crowd

The photographer from Perth was inspired by the New York catcall video so he wanted to do something similar

Others are heard screaming out: ‘Steve Aoki!’ ‘Oh Wow…’ ‘Oh my god! It’s Steve!’ while they appear to touch his arm, stroke his hair and give him hugs in the video.

But when the real Steve Aoki hit the stage, confused festivalgoers are heard questioning Seng, ‘but… you’re way up there?’ or ‘you should be on da stage' and ‘what are you doing Aoki?’

As the crowd cheered on the electro-house DJ, Seng is seen on top of a man’s shoulder singing before running through the crowd.

'This one guy was so happy to see me when the real Steve was playing on stage - he knew that I wasn't the real Steve but he wanted to be involved in the idea,' Seng said.

'So he carried me on top of his shoulders - and he wasn't a big guy - but he carried me to the front. 

'I would do it again if the opportunity comes back but I do feel bad for all the people I tricked. Some people were quite nice and sweet and asked for photos but I felt bad.'

Seng was approached by 'hundreds' of festivalgoers and excited fans who wanted a 'selfie'

One of Seng’s friends, who works in radio, interviewed Aoki and mentioned that his friend ‘pretended to be like you’. Aoki laughs and responds: ‘Yeah, I saw a dude up there that looked like me. I think I pointed at him a few times.’

'My friend dropped by when I was editing the video and coincidently, he told me that he was going to interview Steve on the show so I told him it would be funny to bring it up,' Seng said. 

Seng's video, 'three hours of silent walking through Stereosonic in Perth… as Steve Aoki’ while he is seen in different styles of outfits - matching the same style of fashion as Aoki' has received almost half a million hits since it was posted on Tuesday night.

A caption alongside the video said: ‘Yeah so I get mistaken for Steve Aoki a LOT. It's been a weekly thing for the past five years... at music festivals, bars, on Instagram... it even happened on the streets of Barcelona once.

'I wondered what would happen if I did the same thing... but dressed as Steve. At Stereosonic. Where he was headlining.

‘This is the dumbest thing I've done in a long time.... enjoy.

‘p.s. I do feel a little bit bad about the hundreds of selfies I was asked to be in.... (haha... sorry. I owe you guys a beer or two).’ 

Excited fans have taken to Seng's official page to post their #fakeaoki pictures after finding out his true identity
