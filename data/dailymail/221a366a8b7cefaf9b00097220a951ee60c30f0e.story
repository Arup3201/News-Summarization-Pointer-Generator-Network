The victims of a deadly San Diego parking lot shooting have been identified as Ilona Flint, 22, and 22-year-old Salvatore Belvedere.

The pair were both hit in the head and torso as they sat in a black sedan outside a Macy's store in the early hours of Christmas Eve.

Ms Flint died at the scene, but was able to dial 911 before she succumbed to her injuries.

Victim: Salvatore Belvedere has been left with life-threatening injuries

She told an emergency dispatcher that 
she didn't know precisely where she was, but that she was near the 
Westfield Mission Valley Mall.

Mr Belvedere survived and was rushed to Scripps Mercy Hospital. Police said that he is in a very critical condition.

The Macy's store was open at the time for Christmas shopping, and police are 
appealing for witnesses.

CBS News 8 reported that, according to family members, Ms Flint is the fiancée of Mr Belvedere's brother.

Tragic: The shooting took place in the car park of a Macy's store early on Christmas Eve morning

Salvatore’s brother, Gianni Belvedere, was with the pair on Monday night and hasn’t been seen since.

A suspect hasn’t been named by investigating officers, but Lt Mike Hastings from the San Diego police department's homicide unit said that they are looking for a 5ft 9 to 5ft 11 male of unknown race, last seen dressed in a shirt and tan pants.

He added that he may have driven away from the scene in a dark-gray 2008 to 2011 Honda sedan.

One local told NBC San Diego: 'This is the center of San Diego. The last thing you would expect is a shooting down here.'

Anyone with information is asked to call the San Diego Police Department's Homicide Unit on (619) 531-2293 or San Diego County Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477.
