At first glance this collection of colourful containers looks more like a game of Jenga than a hotel.

But unlike the popular game of wooden blocks, the structure is not intended to tumble over, but instead offers a flexible design for a hotel that can grow, shrink and constantly change – as each room can be slotted in and out of a clever frame.

The Hive-Inn is designed to be made of 
recycled shipping containers, transformed into rooms which could be 
themed and branded by companies, combining accommodation and 
advertising.

Jenga? The structure might appear precarious, but it could be be made up of shipping containers that slot into a metal frame, enabling hotel rooms to be placed in a balanced way, much like the aim of the popular wooden game, Jenga

The building’s modular design, which is tipped as a favourite to win the Radical Innovation Awards, would allow for rooms to be traded in and out without disturbing the surrounding containers, because of its ‘hive-like’ structure.

A 'core' structure at the heart of the building would maintain structural integrity and act as a vertical lobby to connect different containers.

Hong Kong-based architects OVA Studio said its concept could offer lots of advertising opportunities for brands as portions of the hotel could be changed and containers temporarily sponsored by companies like Ferrari, which could design spaces inside and out, so the room is themed (pictured) and also doubles as a billboard

Hong Kong-based architects OVA Studio said its concept could offer lots of advertising opportunities for brands as portions of the hotel could be changed and containers temporarily sponsored by companies like Ferrari, which could design spaces inside and out, so the room is themed and also doubles as a billboard.

The firm claims that its design would give fans of brands the chance to stay in a place that is totally of a company’s aesthetic.

For example, a container designed by a fashion brand might include decor echoing popular designs, while one imagined by a car company, could feature team colours and even a modified car as a piece of furniture.

Here, the layout of the hotel is explained. A 'core' (in yellow) connects removable containers, while 'plant rooms' (in blue) provide garden spaces in between layers of branded containers

As partnerships with brands begin and end, the exterior would change and the layout of the hotel evolve, grow and shrink based on demand for accommodation.

Although presented as a hotel, the architects see other possibilities for Hive-Inn and think a more basic version of the design could be used in emergency housing or medical care units.

They also envision that in the future people could own containers that serve as mobile apartments or offices so that when they travel, their home could travel with them.

The hotel would give brands an opportunity to advertise to the outside world as well as let people stay in a themed room. It is not known whether the price of advertising would subsidise the price of staying in such a hotel of the future

The winners of the Radical Innovation Awards – which recognise ‘concept deign, creativity and potential impact on the industry’ - will be announced next month at the Hospitality Design Expo in Las Vegas.

The architects explained that the idea for their concept hotel ‘lies in the idea of maximum flexibility and mobility, a trend that is embodied in our modern way of life’.

Here, the modular approach to the structure is explained. Pre-decorated containers could be slotted into the metal frame and connected to hotel infrastructure so they could have access to water as well as stairs
