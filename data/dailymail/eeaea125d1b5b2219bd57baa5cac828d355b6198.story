Police officers in West Virginia brutally arrested a 39-year-old father of two who they say appeared intoxicated and was handling his kids roughly while walking them to the park.

But his outraged family denies that 39-year-old Jeffrey Bane was under the influence on Sept. 6, when he was left choking in his own blood and pleading for help while he was pinned to the ground by four Granville PD cops during the Sept. 6 arrest in Morgantown.

The whole arrest takes some 10 minutes and was recorded in a shocking video uploaded to YouTube.

The family says Bane suffers from Huntington's disease, a genetic and terminal illness that causes sufferers to increasingly lose their motor functions, at times appearing to be under the influence.

Cops were caught on tape violently arresting 39-year-old Jeffrey Bane, whose family says he has the terminal illness Huntington's disease

The officers hold Bane down for 10 minutes while he appears to choke on his own blood, pleading for help

After the brutal arrest, Bane was charged with disorderly conduct, obstructing an officer and battery of a cop

'Assuming 
because of his appearance he was high on narcotics with out reason they 
began to subdue him, macing and beating him in the head as he fell to 
his face were he was —  then held with a great amount of force by two 
officers double his size as a third one landed on his torso,' nephew 
Josh Bane told The Free Thought Project. 

Granville
 PD says officers responded to a report of child abuse when they 
approached Bane, who appeared intoxicated and was handling his kids 
roughly, according to the Morgantown Dominion Post. 

'The children appeared to be overheated, and when asked about provisions
 that he had with him for the children, Bane struck the stroller 
violently with his hand, pushing it forward abruptly while his infant 
son was still seated inside,' police claim in a report, according to the Post.

The
 officers also said Bane kicked and tried to spit on the officers. He 
was charged with disorderly conduct, obstructing an officer and battery 
of a police officer, the Post reported.

Bane's family says he is a father of two who suffers from Huntington's disease, a terminal illness that causes him to lose some of his motor functions and appear to be intoxicated

His family, however, offers a different picture.

'As my uncle and his two children headed towards the store before heading to the park together they crossed an intersection to the other side when the stroller became hung up on the curb,' Josh Bane told The Free Thought Project.

'As the light changed, to keep his children out of harms way, he hurriedly put his 2-year-old on the curb, told her to stay put and pulled the stroller up on the curb.'

Josh Bane says his cousins were left 'unattended' during the 10-minute arrest while his uncle 'pleads and cries out in pain for the lack of breath and agony being applied to him.'

'So as he lay there uncontrollably moving due to his terminal condition, he is forcefully detained to the point of screaming for help,' Josh Bane said. 'He is spitting blood and drowning in it and the officer holding his head only applies more pressure and instructs him to "quit spitting."'

Bane's face is covered in bruises and his knee was left bloody and scraped during the arrest

Bane's foot was also banged up during the vicious arrest

The outraged family has set up a Facebook page seeking justice for Bane, hoping to get the charges against him dropped.

The video was posted to YouTube by a witness to the arrest who identified herself as Sara Bostonia. She calls out 'stop it!' — and is confronted by one of the cops arresting Bane.

'How are you involved with this guy?' he asks.

'I just was driving by,' Bostonia replies. 'This is insane.'

'He is choking on his own blood,' she adds. 'I can hear it from my car.'

'This is wrong,' she tells the officer defiantly.

'If you want to continue filming, that’s OK,' the cop replies. 'If you continue to be loud and boisterous, I will arrest you for obstructing, OK?

'Just leave me alone,' she says.
