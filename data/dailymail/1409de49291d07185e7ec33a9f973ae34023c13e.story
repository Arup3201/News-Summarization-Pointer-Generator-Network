Tony Abbott has been asked if he's concerned about being a 'one term wonder' as the latest opinion poll shows his approval rating has hit its lowest point in five months.

The Prime Minister appeared on Channel Nine's Today show on Tuesday morning and faced a barrage of questions from host Karl Stefanovic over his controversial budget decisions.

As Mr Abbott took aim at the Labor party saying they were trying to sabotage the government's budget and he wished they weren't 'in such a feral mood', Stefanovic hit back by saying he was exactly the same in Opposition.

'With respect you were fairly feral in Opposition weren't you, I mean the greatest respect by that, and ... why would (Bill Shorten) do anything different when it worked for you?' Stefanovic asked. 

'The reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse.

'No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem.' 

Mr Abbott defended his government's budget saying it wasn't in 'shambles' and said the budget has been under control since the Liberal party were elected to government. 

'The carbon tax has been successfully repealed, the mining tax has been successfully repealed, the boats are stopping, free trade agreements are being negotiated,' he said. 

'Sure the polls aren't great but no one said the task of budget repair would be easy.

'I don't pretend this parliament has been easy for us… but we have already made substantial changes.'

It follows the latest opinion polls, conducted for News Corp at the weekend, that reported a drop in the prime minister's satisfaction rating for a fourth consecutive month, giving him 33 per cent.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten remains the preferred prime minister, with his level unchanged at 39 per cent.

The government and opposition are tied for the primary vote on 37 per cent each after the coalition picked up a point and the opposition lost two.

Labor maintained in front on a two-party-preferred basis, leading 54 to 46 per cent.

The latest opinion poll results follow a ragged week for the Liberal party, which centred around the controversial cuts to the ABC and confusion over whether the government was shelving the GP $7 co-payment.

In Tuesday's interview on Today, the prime minister said issues handled without needing parliamentary approval had been effective. 

'We're repairing the budget and Labor is doing its best to sabotage... I'm not complaining because that's the Senate the people elected,' Mr Abbott said.

'Look at the way we've handled foreign policy issues like MH17 and MH370, look at the way we've handled the foreign fighters threats.

'Sure it gets tougher when you have to negotiate your legislation past your political opponents in the Senate and I wish the Labor party wasn't in such a feral mood.' 

When asked if he was concerned about being a 'one term wonder', Mr Abbott drew on former Prime Minister John Howard's first term.

'I was a member of the Howard Government. They didn't look too flash in its first term. It went on to be the most successful,' he said.

'I think the Australian people can be confident that they've had a good year under their belt. We're getting fundamentals right and we are delivering for the people of Australia.'

Mr Abbott said on Tuesday the Liberal party were trying to repair the budget, but Labor and Bill Shorten were doing its best to sabotage it
