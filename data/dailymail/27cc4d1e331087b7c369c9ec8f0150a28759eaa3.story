Cressida Bonas poses with her posse as she let her hair down at an upmarket music festival at the weekend.

Wearing a clinging psychedelic cat suit, the 25-year-old actress danced within feet of her ex-boyfriend, Prince Harry, at Wilderness in Oxfordshire, but was unperturbed.

She partied in high spirits with a gaggle of girlfriends including Georgia Forbes, Molly Whitehall and Julia de Boinville.

Not awkward? Prince Harry also attended the Wilderness event at Cornbury Park in Oxfordshire this weekend

The close friends smile and hug for the picture, taken at the festival in the grounds of Lord and Lady Rotherwick’s 17th Century estate, Cornbury Park.

Georgia Forbes, who dressed down for the day in denim hotpants, is one of Cressida’s closest friends and confidantes - they lived together in Leeds when they attended university and the pair are often spotted partying with the high-society set.

Donning a black jumpsuit and a sequin jacket, glamorous Molly Whitehall, 24, is comedian Jack Whitehall’s little sister.

Molly went to Malborough College with Julia De Boinville, who is also a long-standing friends of Miss Bonas.

Julia wore a fitted peach playsuit, baring her long legs and draping her arm over Cressida’s shoulder for the photo.

Julia and Cressida were both guests at a charity event last month, chaired by Princess Eugenie, who is also a close friend of Cressida.

The fashionable jet set let their hair down at the Wildness festival, which attracts a decidedly more upmarket crowd than your average summer music gathering.

By coincidence, the fourth in line to the throne - whom Cressida split from in spring after a two-year romance - was also partying at the festival.

The pair are not believed to have spoken - and may not have even been aware of each other’s presence.

The event featured DJs and a special appearance by performers from the sexually-explicit The Box nightclub in London, frequented by many of the younger royals.
