A Brooklyn woman has become one of Instagram's most popular new users after creating an account which documents all of the blunt and critical text messages that she receives from her Jewish mother.  

Kate Siegel, an associate producer at Condé Nast, chronicles her mother's crazy thoughts and hilarious advice on her Instagram page titled Crazy Jewish Mom. 

The 26-year-old, who shares the actual text messages she receives from her mother, has gained close to 300,000 followers since the account was started last November.

'I started this project three months ago, because my friends always laughed at my mom's texts,' Miss Siegel told Yahoo Parenting. 'I'm an only child so I get all my mom's attention.'

Crazy Jewish Mom, who prefers to remain anonymous, lives in New Jersey with Miss Siegel's father and is constantly trying to set up her daughter with an array of Ivy League educated men - even though she has a boyfriend.

After Miss Siegel told her that she was being crazy, her mom noted that it was crazy for her to waste her eggs on a 'Superjew who can't commit'.

Even though Crazy Jewish Mom loves to remind her daughter that her eggs are drying up and that she needs to get highlights, Miss Siegel told the Today show that it is harmless fun, noting that she created the account to make people laugh.

'I find the neuroses amusing, and I know it all comes from a place of love. I think it's hilarious, and it does not bother me at all. Even the most outrageous stuff comes from a place of love and with humor.'

'What can I say? She's an only child and I am always trying to help,' she said. 'I love her more than anything. We are very, very close. We over-share.'

She added: 'Kate always knew she could tell me anything, and I wouldn't be shocked. But I can never get her to go bra shopping with me. I guess she has her boundaries.'
