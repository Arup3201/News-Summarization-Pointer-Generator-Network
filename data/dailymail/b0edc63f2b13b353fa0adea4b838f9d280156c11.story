Killed during a dare: Liam Armstrong died after being hit by a New York subway train as he ran across the tracks while celebrating his 18th birthday

A New York teenager celebrating his 18th birthday was killed by an oncoming subway train as he tried to run across the tracks as a dare, it emerged today.

Liam Armstrong, a popular student at Smithtown High School East on Long Island, was at 79th and Broadway on Manhattan’s Upper West Side when he was hit by a No. 2 express train at 6.30pm yesterday.

His leg was severed and he died of severe head injuries, authorities said.

Liam and two friends had mistakenly 
boarded a northbound No. 1 train while trying to get to Greenwich 
Village and got off at 79th street when they realized their mistake.

But
instead of crossing to the southbound side above ground, they dared 
each other to run across the tracks, police sources told the New York Post.

One friend successfully reached the other side and another had yet to cross when Liam was struck as the train barreled into the station.

As
the 79th Street station is a local stop where only the 1 train stops, 
the 2 express train was likely moving speedily through the tunnel.

Police sources said a one-litre bottle of Bacardi rum was found in his backpack and two fake IDs were in his wallet.

Later, one of the friends who was with him told of his shock and grief on Twitter.

Dakota Walsh said: 'Your [sic] my brother, I’m sorry I didn’t protect you.'

Another friend, Kerin Grisanti said: 'I 
can’t believe this happened. He has three little siblings and he loves 
them — he’s a great big brother.'

Friends
said Armstrong was set to graduate this year and was considering 
following his father — a Nassau County detective sergeant — into the 
police force.

'He was a very nice kid, always making everybody laugh,' Ali Grimaldi, a senior at Smithtown HS West told the New York Post.

'It was his 18th birthday today, and I think they just wanted to have a little bit of fun'

Law
enforcement officials said that the train operator tried to stop the 
moving cars by pulling the emergency brake but could not do it in time.

Witnesses
said they were stuck in the train while investigators arrived at the 
scene as the power was immediately cut to the train.

Commuters were stuck in the cars for 
more than an hour as they waited for instructions from Metropolitan 
Transit Authority (MTA) officials.

Passenger Javier Corro told CBS New York that subway riders were eventually evacuated while most of the train was in the express tunnel.

Another witness who requested not to be named said they could see parts of the teen’s body as they were evacuated.

‘There’s a person under the train and I saw his hand and his arm by the wheels of the train,’ the witness said.

‘The conductor said, “Oh my God! And the train just stopped,’ he told the site.

A police officer at the scene told DNAInfo that tonight’s horrific events were ‘an unfortunate incident.’

He continued: ‘You have some kids 
that don’t know how to come upstairs and go to the other side (of the 
station). That’s all I can say about this.’

Following the teen’s death, 1, 2, and
3 train service was cut from Times Square-42nd St up to 96th Street in 
both directions, according to the MTA.

There have been six subway deaths this year alone, followed by several harrowing cases in 2012, including two people who were killed when they were pushed onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train.

Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer said in January that he was deeply concerned with the frequency and number of serious subway injuries and deaths, pushing for an MTA safety audit.

‘Because of the recent surge in subway deaths, we’re really on pace to hit 116 (subway deaths this year),’ he told WNYC, adding that it was ‘very alarming.’

‘We want to look at new signage reminding people to stay away from the platforms.’
