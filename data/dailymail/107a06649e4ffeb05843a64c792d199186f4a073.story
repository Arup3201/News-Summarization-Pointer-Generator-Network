If he's after some gruelling competition, he's in the right job.

But a bit of a fight never put off 
presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who followed his high school 
sweetheart to her Mormon university after discovering she was dating 
campus's most eligible man.

The battle - which Romney won, 
eventually claiming the sweetheart as his bride - is described by the 
Washington Post in an article documenting Romney's conservative life at Brigham Young University.

Speaking to his college friends and teachers, it reveals how he shunned protests against the church's ban on black priests and how he was despised as a wealthy teacher's pet by other students.

Sweethearts: Mitt Romney and Ann Davies, pictured after their wedding in 1969, were informally engaged before he moved to France for missionary work. She began dating a fellow student in Utah

When Ann Davies enrolled at Brigham 
Young in 1967, Romney had already completed his first year at Stanford 
and had began missionary work in France.

Ann, who was a few years below Romney at school, had known her sweetheart since they were young and he had informally asked her to marry him at his senior prom in 1965.

Romney's father, then the Michigan 
governor, had baptized Ann and her brother into Mormonism, and she saw Mitt in France - under strict supervision - when she studied there for a 
semester.

Months later,
after Ann had returned to her studies in Provo, Utah, Romney was involved in a
car crash that left him and a friend hospitalised, and killed another.

As he recovered from head injuries and a
fractured arm, he received a letter from Ann that she had started dating 
Kim S. Cameron, a student body vice president who would be voted the 
school's 'most preferred man',Â the Washington Post reported.

Cameron, who treated Ann to movies and dance shows, told the paper: 'We liked each other.'

In an interview with the National Enquirer this week, Cameron added: 'When I started dating Ann, she never mentioned anything about a pact with Mitt that they were going to get married.

'When he returned, I knew that she would end up with him.'

He is also quoted in biography The Real 
Romney as saying it is 'probably right' that he thought for a while he 
might marry Ann, adding, 'emotionally, I felt very close to her'.

He admitted to the Post that, although the son of the country's most famous Mormon politician was abroad, he still had the upper hand.

'If you have a choice to pick either 
Mitt Romney or Kim Cameron, who are you going to pick? I mean, 99 out of
100, no contest,' Cameron, who went on to marry another BYU student, said.

'Near
tears' in France, Romney wrote Ann letters begging to rekindle their 
relationship. She responded that he should join her at the Utah 
university and he agreed he would go for a semester.

Romney studied at the university for two years, completing his studies. His
father later said: 'Now he is just like the rest of you brain-washed 
students - he thinks BYU is the best university in the country.'

And Romney won what he had moved 
there for, marrying Ann shortly after in 1969. They went on to have five
sons - the first, Tagg, in 1970 while they were still 
undergraduates.

While
at the university, he became heavily involved on campus, and proved a 
prolific fundraiser for the Cougar Club athletics programme, of which he
was president.

But Romney, dubbed a 'straight shooter' by his peers, turned his back on rallies against the Vietnam war and the church's conservative rules, staying away from a protest on the ban on black priests.

Aside from his friends and admirers, there was a handful of students who did not think much of the straight-A English literature student from good Mormon pedigree.

Brood: The couple went on to have five children, (L-R) Tagg, Ben, Matt, Craig and Josh

When Romney returned to the 
university in 1997 to give a lecture, his former classmate Kristine 
Hansen presented Romney with membership to the school's Phi Kappa Phi 
society of academic achievers, the Post reported.

He received the honor and joked he had declined an offer to join during his student days 'because it cost money'.

Hansen, who had not been able to join as a student because she could not afford the cost, told the Post: 'I thought, "You could have paid that". To me, it wasn't that funny.'

In another anecdote that appears to highlight Romney's attitude towards finances, one staff member told the Post that Romney had approached him about applying for an English PhD.

Marshall Craig responded: 'You can 
afford to read all the books you'd like, but why would you get a PhD and
starve?' Instead he suggested: 'You should get an MBA' - which Romney 
did.

Conservative: The Romneys attended the Mormon-run Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah

While a student at BYU, Romney garnered 
good relationships with teachers and would greet them in the halls - 
much to the annoyance of some of his classmates who saw him a teacher's 
pet.

One former student, Terrell Hunt, took a philosophy class with Romney - but received a poor mark for an 100-page final paper.

Hunt wrote a letter to the teacher asking: 'Is the analysis on comments you made on my paper typical to the comments you made on other students in the class? In fact, I'd like to see your comments on Mitt Romney's paper.'

The philosophy teacher C. Terry Warner, recalled the student as 'full of himself'.

Romney and his new wife - and their ever-expanding brood - stayed in Utah until he began his MBA at Harvard in 1971.
