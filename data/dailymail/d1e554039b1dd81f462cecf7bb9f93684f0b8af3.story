Tottenham Hotspur look to have won the race for 18-year-old MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli with the player booked in for a medical at White Hart Lane following successful talks.

Alli, valued at around £5million, had also been pursued by Newcastle United and Aston Villa, who will be disappointed by his decision.

The midfielder has already made 76 first-team appearances for his League One club despite being two months shy of his 19th birthday.
