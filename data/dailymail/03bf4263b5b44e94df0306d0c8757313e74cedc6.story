An Arab man has placed an advert for a private tutor to transform him into an English speaking, piano playing, opera loving Renaissance man worthy of a place at Oxford University.

The unnamed businessman, in his 30s, placed the job advert for the full-time role in the Times Education Supplement, offering the lucky job-seeker a generous salary of £122,300 or 146,700 euros.

In return, the successful candidate will be expected to help him through his GCSEs and A Levels, teach him English like a native, the jazz piano, appreciate opera and understand the great works of Shakespeare.

An unnamed Arab man, in his 30s, has placed a job advert to find a private tutor to teach him English, help him learn the piano and appreciate Shakespeare, in his bid to gain a place at Oxford University

His ultimate goal is to study at Oxford University 
but he adds in the lengthy advert that he is realistic about his 'hugely ambitious' aim and 
states he knows a place is not guaranteed.

The unusual role is reminiscent of that played 
by Professor Higgins in the play Pygmalion, coaching the man as Higgins 
does Eliza Doolittle.

The tutor would be expected to work from
8am to 11pm each day and 'should stay in proximity to the client at all
times', spending Friday and Saturday evenings with the man.

Anyone applying must be 'highly intelligent, erudite, well-read, musically accomplished and socially and culturally versatile'.

And it seems the ideal candidate is a retired former head teacher 'of a renowned British private school 
or someone with comparable experience who is seeking early retirement'.

The description reveals the mystery man left school in his late teens choosing to follow a path into business 'where he has been very successful'. But it states he has 'now decided that he would like to invest in himself'.

He wants the tutor to guide him through GCSE and 
A-levels in a range of subjects, but adds he is not certain of the 
subject he would like to study.

Rex Harrison as Professor Henry Higgins and Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle starring in the 1964 film My Fair Lady, based on the play Pygmalion. The job advert reveals similarities with George Bernard Shaw's characters

In addition, he wants the tutor to speak English 'without any geographical
specificity' and must be able to coach the client to the point where 
his 'Arabic background is no longer evident'.

When the tutor is not conducting one-to-one lessons he or she will be expected to plan a range of cultural excursions.

The
job advert reads: 'The tutor should constantly be researching and planning a
culturally rich range of musical and dramatic performance, visits to 
art galleries and museums, restaurants, sites of historical or
contemporary interest — any place or activity that the tutor thinks 
will be an essential part of this "life–curriculum" in its most 
encompassing sense.'

To fulfill the 'demanding role' the candidate will need to be fit and healthy and express a 'huge amount of energy and joie de vivre'.

The successful candidate will call Geneva in Switzerland home. Part of the job description reveals the role will involve travel all over Europe and across the world

Although the client does not directly specify the tutor must be female, the advert refers to the candidate as 'she'.

And
reassuring potential candidates of where they would live, the 
description reveals 'the client will provide suitable, safe, private 
accommodations in all locations', including apartments, hotels and 
yachts.

The advert goes on to state it is preferred that candidates applying are non-smokers and hold clean driving licences.

It adds: 'She
will need to be open about travel to a range of destinations including 
in the Middle East and Africa. She should lead a healthy lifestyle and 
be in good physical shape.'

Adam Caller, founder of Tutors International, who placed the advert on behalf of their client said since listing the job yesterday he has been 'inundated' with applications.

He said: 'I haven't added them all up yet, but my email has not stopped going.

'We deal with a small volume of job adverts but the kinds of jobs we deal with are often extraordinary.

'In this case we are really very particular about the person we are looking for. They really must be a retired headteacher of a well-known private school.

'Frankly nobody else will come close. We might consider other exceptional applicants when we get to that stage.'

He said there is no closing date for the application, adding the client would rather wait until he finds the perfect candidate.

'I was first contacted by my client in March or April, it has taken until now to detail the job specification,' Mr Caller added.

'My client would like someone to start the role in April but we would rather ensure we get the right person.
