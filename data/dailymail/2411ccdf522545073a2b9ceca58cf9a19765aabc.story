A government office worker who faked a spinal tumour stole £70,000 to to buy 22 designer handbags has been jailed.

Zaira Beg cashed 35 forged cheques so that she could splash out on luxury items including a £4000 Louis Vuitton bag.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that her haul of exclusive leather goods also included top name designers Gucci and Hermes.

And that when they were discovered some of them remained unused and in their original packaging.

Beg, 26, forged the cheques over a nine month period while she worked for welfare-to-work provider Ingeus UK Ltd.

Prosecutor Karen Maxwell-Burnside said Beg ripped off her employers between February and October 2009.

She told the court the treasury assistant faked a spinal tumour and regularly feigned illness to take time off.

The court also heard that in the days after she cashed a forged cheque she would go shopping.

Beg was eventually caught when an investigation was launched into her repeated absences and she was unable to explain and back up her reasons for taking time off.

She later complained that she had been bullied at work and passed over for promotion.

Ms Maxwell-Burnside added: 'The timing of the cashing of the cheques seemed to correspond with the times she was on sick leave.

'It seems she would go and get the money when she was not working.

'Although she took time off work she would return for the odd day to complete the monthly reconciliation forms in an effort to ensure her fraud was not discovered.

'In total Beg, who was earning £1,700 per month, stole £71,350 and bought 22 handbags as well as a laptop computer.

But many of the bags were recovered from Beg's home in Walthamstow, east London, unused and still in their original packaging.

Ms Maxwell-Burnside said: 'Miss Beg told officers she had been bullied at work.

'She also felt that she had been passed over by less well qualified colleagues on the basis of their dress and their manner.'

The court heard that since her arrest Beg had been diagnosed with Bipolar affective disorder and was receiving treatment for the condition.

Caroline Jackson, defending Beg, told the court: 'It is not being put forward that she was so unwell that she did not know what she was doing.

'Though, to have some 22 designer handbags at home seems quite odd behaviour.'

Sentencing Beg Judge Nicholas Huskinson said: 'This was a very serious offence involving a breach of trust, especially having regards to your position of responsibility.

'It was carried out over a substantial period of time and indeed the last cheque was drawn after you had already been suspended.

'The deviousness with which you operated can be noted in that not only did you forge the cheques but you took substantial sick leave for which your company was receptive and generous to but you came in on the day of reconciliation in order to cover your tracks and that in my judgement shows a degree of calculation.

'Beg, of Walthamstow, admitted one charge of fraud and was jailed for 16 months.
