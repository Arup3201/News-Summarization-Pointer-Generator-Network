Ireland boss Martin O’Neill insisted that their Euro 2016 hopes remained alive and well despite 1-0 defeat by Scotland at his old stomping ground.

O’Neill, who confessed that the ‘frenetic’ encounter at Celtic Park had been far from easy on the eye, is now pinning his hopes on a run of home games — including Scotland’s visit to Dublin next June — to regain momentum.

‘That’s us and Scotland on seven points each,’ said the former Celtic manager. ‘In truth, our own fate will depend on what happens in the Aviva Stadium.

Martin O’Neill confessed that the 'frenetic' encounter had been far from easy on the eye

‘We’ve got four of the next five games at home. We’ve had a difficult run, three away games and one at home — seven points on the board.

‘With Poland winning in Georgia and Germany still the strongest team in the group, it’s going to be tough.

‘Everything is to play for. I would have believed that if we’d come out of this game unscathed.

‘We have to get ourselves together. If we’re talking about our next competitive match in March, we’ve got to get ourselves together and be ready for Poland. We are absolutely still in this, without a doubt.’

O’Neill confessed that Scots-born winger Aiden McGeady, booed every time he touched the ball, had made a less dramatic than expected impact on the game, saying: ‘I think that Aiden, like a number of players here, for the sort of form he has shown for us in the games, he would have been a bit frustrated tonight.

‘I haven’t spoken to him about that (the booing) but, for the form he has shown in recent times for us, the match he won for us in Georgia, I think he had a frustrating time.

‘The atmosphere obviously was great. But this wasn’t a return to Celtic. It had a totally different feel to it.

‘Last night, when I came up here and walked on to the pitch, it might have evoked a few memories. But today I was totally focused on trying to get something out of the game.’

Addressing his own team’s fairly brutal performance, the Ireland boss added: ‘I don’t think either of the teams were able to get it down and play. After the first 10 or 15 minutes of the game, it kept developing in that style.

‘Scotland didn’t get hold of it, either. We weren’t able to do so. It’s a tough contest. We’ve been talking about if for weeks, that it would be a derby game, a derby atmosphere.

‘It had those ingredients. Neither team could keep possession long enough.

‘Whether that was because of the atmosphere, maybe a bit of nervousness, it applied to both teams. We’re disappointed because I thought we had opportunities to get it and play, despite the atmosphere. We were unable to do so.

‘We’ve conceded a goal after they’d forced corner – but I thought we were comfortable. We conceded from a set-piece.

‘I thought it was a frenetic match. Stop-start a lot of times, littered with fouls. Just like a derby in many aspects. But I thought we were going to get something out of the game.

‘I felt the first goal would win. The two sides cancelled each other out, to coin the old phrase. I thought we were not in phenomenal danger when the goal occurred.’

The defeat comes at the end of a difficult week for O’Neill, who has lost key players to injury — and been distracted by allegations of Roy Keane getting involved in an incident with a fan at the team hotel.

‘The Roy Keane incident has genuinely not bothered me,’ he insisted. ‘It’s a distraction, that’s not a problem.

‘The injuries are part of the game. You curse your luck and get on with it.

‘No excuses. We had players out there tonight capable of winning the game, never mind coming out of it unscathed.

Top scorer Robbie Keane started on the bench in favour of Shane Long

Keane came on as late substitute but could not affect the outcome

‘We lost it, the game was on a knife edge, it could have gone either way. When Scotland scored, even they might have been thinking a draw would have been fair.’

Defending his decision to drop top scorer Robbie Keane in favour of Shane Long, O’Neill said: ‘I make decisions for the good of the team. Robbie accepted it because we were playing away from home and wanted to stretch the game. Shane Long can do that.’

Meanwhile, Ireland defender Seamus Coleman vowed the Republic would bounce back from the set-back.

‘We have to regroup now,’ said the Everton man. ‘We came here wanting to win the game but we would have been happy if we had left with a point in the end.

‘But unfortunately we switched off for the corner and they scored.

‘It is a horrible feeling. I know we pushed them back towards the end but it was not good enough and we’re all disappointed.

‘It’s a tough group, we knew it was going to be and we expected every game to be difficult.’
