Falling out of her dress was the least of Charlize Theron's concerns as she arrived to an awards show in New York tonight.

Instead,the
 36-year-old actress brought new meaning to the phrase 'tripping the 
light fantastic' as she stumbled over an erroneous stage lamp at the 
ever-so classy Cipriani Wall Street venue.

The
 South African beauty almost went south as she stalked around the grand
 building on her way to the red carpet at the Gotham Independent Film 
Awards, clad in a daring black and white dress split to the navel.

Scroll down for list of winners...

Putting her foot in it!
 Charlize Theron almost falls over after tripping over an erroneous 
stage lamp at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in New York tonight

Luckily, she was well fastened into 
her plunging outfit, which obediently stayed in place as she skipped and
 hopped over the obstruction.

Clearly the towering actress had 
failed to notice the light, which was set beneath one of the pillars 
inside the Greek-style building.

The Academy Award winning actress 
joined a plethora of stars at the event tonight - where she herself received a career award honour - and at which The Tree of Life and Beginners shared the top prize for best
 feature film.

Tripping
 the light fantastic: The actress managed to recover just in time, 
though, with her daring dress staying obediently in place

Who put that there? Charlize was revered for her grace... until tonight

After a spell away from the big screen
 - her last film being Astro Boy in 2009 - Theron will make her movie 
comeback with Young Adult, set for release next month.

It will see her play the role Mavis 
Gray, a writer of teen literature and one-time school bully who returns 
to her small hometown to recapture her youth.

Once there, she is set on a mission to reclaim her now happily married high school sweetheart, played by Patrick Wilson.

Not much on Theron: The 36-year-old actress slipped into a daring black and white dress split to the navel for the show, where she was honoured with a special tribute award

Walking tall: She teamed the look with a pair of towering gold shoes, which were clearly an effort to walk in

Patton Oswalk also stars in the movie - and posed for photographs with Charlize tonight on the red carpet.

Charlize is also currently filming 
Snow White & The Huntsmen, playing the role of the Evil Queen. 
Twilight star Kristen Stewart is portraying the titular role.

The Gotham Awards is a key event for independent movies which also marks the 
start of the film-awards season culminating in the Oscars.

On stage: Theron regained her poise and posture for an appearance on stage with actors Patton Oswalt, one of her co-stars in her upcoming movie Young Adult

The honours for Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, a 
mystical period drama starring Brad Pitt, and the Christopher Plummer film Beginners, which stars 
Ewan McGregor as a man whose elderly father (Plummer) comes out of the 
closet, scored upset victories.

Alexander Payne's The Descendants, a 
well-reviewed Oscar front-runner which stars George Clooney in a family 
drama set in Hawaii, was nominated in three categories but won none.

Instead Beginners, directed by 
relative neophyte Mike Mills, also won best ensemble performance at the 
New York-based awards, co-hosted by Edie Falco and Oliver Platt.

Edenborough, was honoured with a special tribute award - as was Theron,

Legs on show: Executive Director of the Independent Feature Project, Joana Vicente, posing with quirky actress Tilda Swinton

Dressed to impress: Edie Falco, who starred in The Sopranos, was host for the night. Tilda wore a customary edgy design

Mills lauded his cast, singling out 
Plummer by saying there was 'no good reason for Christopher Plummer to 
believe in me. But he did.'

The best documentary honour went to 
Better This World, about two boyhood friends from Texas accused of 
attempting to bomb the 2008 Republican convention.

The Gotham Awards are held annually 
by the Independent Feature Project, a non-profit organization founded in
 1979 that supports independent filmmaking.

Honoured: Felicity Jones took the prize for breakthrough actor for her role in Like Crazy, pictured on stage receiving the award from Melissa Leo

The awards provide a focus 
on the year's top independent movies heading into award season.

Felicity Jones took the prize for 
breakthrough actor for her work in Like Crazy, playing a British student
 separated from her American boyfriend after her visa expires.

Dee Rees won the breakthrough 
director award for her debut non-documentary feature, Pariah, about a 
New York City African-American teenager confronting her sexual identity.

Girlfriend won the audience award, 
while Scenes of a Crime, the story of a man appealing a life prison 
sentence, was named best film without a distribution deal.

Special tribute awards were given to Theron, Gary Oldman, A Dangerous Method director David 
Cronenberg and Fox Filmed Entertainment CEO Tom Rothman.

Films and performances singled out at
 the Gothams often reflect those nominated for Independent Spirit 
Awards, another key set of honours for indie movies organised by Los 
Angeles-based group Film Independent, which announces its annual 
nominations for the year's best on tomorrow Tuesday.

Last year's top Gotham winner, 
Winter's Bone, an ultra-low-budget indie that cost about $2 million, 
went on to score four Oscar nominations including best picture.

Presenters at the awards included Alec Baldwin, Stanley Tucci, Melissa Leo and Tilda Swinton.

Other VIPs in attendance included 
Elizabeth Olsen, who glittered in a gold dress and Tilda Swinton, who 
donned a customary edgy outfit consisting of a trench coat with wire 
detailing.
