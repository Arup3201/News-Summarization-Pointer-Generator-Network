Last words: Kelly Gissendaner, 46, recorded a last message before her execution was canceled

The only woman on Georgia's death row told her children that 'love beats out hate' just 90 minutes before she was due to be executed on Monday night.

Kelly Gissendaner, 46, had been taken to the prison in Jackson where Georgia carries out executions by lethal injection, and expected to die that night - before officials discovered a problem with the drug that was meant to kill her.

Executioners for the state found that their dose of pentobarbital, a clear solution solution they were going to use on Gissendaner, was cloudy, sparking fears that it would not work properly. 

The Georgia Department of Corrections first delayed the execution, scheduled for 7pm, then eventually canceled it at 11pm 'out of an abundance of caution'.

But when she recorded her statement, addressed to her children and legal team, she would have had no idea that she was not minutes from death.

A recording of the statement, obtained from prison officials by NBC News, revealed that she told her children, whose father she helped murder, to 'keep strong' in the wake of her death.

Speaking in a thick Southern accent, she said: 'I just want to tell my kids I love them and I'm proud of them.

'And no matter what happens tonight, love does beat out hate. You keep strong and keep your heads up. I love you.'

She also left a message for her legal team, who had made repeated appeals for clemency from state authorities and the Supreme Court - all of which were denied.

She said: 'I want to tell my lawyers thank you for all they've done. No matter what happens I know you've done your best and I love you all.'

As well as making her last statement, Gissendaner had also been fed the enormous last meal she requested, which included two Burger King cheeseburger meals, cornbread, ice cream, lemonade, popcorn and a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that she had eaten the meal by the time she recorded her statement, and was likely just a few feet away from the death chamber. 

Gissendaner had come within hours of death before. She was originally due to be executed in late February, but officials called it off because of forecast snow.

She had spent the previous 17 years in prison waiting to die, after being convicted of murdering her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, despite not having physically killed him.

She Gissendaner, who was convicted of murder in the wake of the February 1997, which she persuaded her lover, Greg Owen, into carrying out.

In her trial, prosecutors told how she repeatedly pushed Owen to kill her husband. He then ambushed him, forced him to drive to a remote area and stabbed him multiple times.

Owen and Gissendaner then met up and set fire to the dead man's car. Owen, who eventually confessed and testified against his former girlfriend, is serving a life prison sentence and is eligible for parole in eight years.

Gissendanger's execution is one of two postponed by concerns over the drug - though officials have said it would have been strong enough to end her life.

In a statement reported by the Gwinnett Daily Post, a spokesman said: 'The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits.

Feet from death: Gissendaner was in the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson when she recorded her message

'Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the execution team performed the necessary checks.

'At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, inmate Gissendaner’s execution has been postponed.'

The corrections department has yet to say to which date the execution will be rescheduled.

Many have called for Gissendaner to be spared the death penalty and given life in prison instead - including her children.

But the parents and sisters of Doug Gissendaner have been unrelenting in their call for her to be executed.

In a statement issued the morning after the execution was called off, they said death for her is 'justice'.

He said: 'Doug is the true victim of this pre-meditated and heinous crime.

'We, along with our friends and supporters and our faith, will continue fighting for Doug until he gets the justice he deserves no matter how long it takes.'
