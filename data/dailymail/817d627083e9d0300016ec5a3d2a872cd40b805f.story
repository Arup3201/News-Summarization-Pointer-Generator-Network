As arguments over marriage equality rage on in the nation’s capital a striking new map shows how many of the nation's people may already have taken a stand in its favor.

The social media world went red this week according to a newly released map by Facebook that showed an overwhelming increase in users swapping out their profile pictures, many for pink-on-red equal signs.

The Human Rights Campaign urged people on Monday to change their Facebook profile pictures to the sign to show their support of marriage equality in the midst of the Supreme Court's hearings over two potentially nation-changing cases.

Changed: Facebook saw an overwhelming 120 percent increase in users changing their profile pictures from the previous week, with the most user's counties seen in brighter red

Seen it? This is the original pink-on-red profile photo the Human Rights Campaign urged marriage equality supporters to place on their Facebook page this week

By Tuesday Facebook reported a 120 percent increase in profile picture changes from the previous Tuesday.

It was approximately 2.7 million people to be exact according to the social networking site.

'While millions of U.S. Facebook users update their profile photos on a given day, we found that significantly more users -- roughly 2.7 million (120%) more, updated their profile photo on Tuesday, March 26 compared to the previous Tuesday,' they wrote with their findings.

The trend did not signify that all of those millions specifically switched to the pink-on-red equal sign, however.

But they say the exact timing and irregularity suggest a substantial correlation.

'We find that the increase in uploads 
does indeed start around the time when HRC began urging their Facebook 
followers to change their profile photos at 1 p.m. EST,' they wrote.

Rise: This graph shows that when the Human Rights Campaign urged supporters to change their profile photos at 1pm, where the dashed vertical line is seen, a major rise was immediately seen in Facebook updates

In a graph showing the change, users' profiles can be seen drastically updated compared to the previous days just after a dashed vertical line that marks the HRC's 1pm statement (see above).

Among those who swapped during this time were also to have certain demographics in common.

Most were around 30 years old, slightly more were women, and the users generally updated their profile more often than others.

Geographically the top 25 counties showing a change were
also in college towns, the most active being Ann Arbor Michigan's 
Washtenaw County, home to Michigan State University.

Others included the counties of the 
University of North Carolina, Duke University, Indiana University, 
University of Iowa, Ohio University, University of Wisconsin, University
of Coloraddo and the University of Texas at Austin.

San Francisco and Washington D.C. - where HRC is headquartered - also ranked highly while Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City had only slight increases.

An overwhelming region of the country that showed less activity than others on the map were parts of the southeast, commonly known as the Bible Belt.

'Standing in support of marriage equality on social media, and bleeding the Internet red, sends a powerful message to the community -- particularly LGBT youth -- that the majority of Americans are on the right side of history,' HRC said in response to Facebook's results on Friday.

'For a long time, when people stood up for a cause and weren't all physically standing shoulder to shoulder, the size of their impact wasn’t immediately apparent,' Facebook wrote in close of their report. 'But today, we can see the spread of an idea online in greater detail than ever before.'
