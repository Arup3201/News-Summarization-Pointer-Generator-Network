Charged: Nykerion 'Kaca' Nealon, 17, has been arrested for killing an Iraqi neighbor last week

A 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of an Iraqi newlywed who was gunned down as he took pictures of his first snowfall just weeks after arriving in the U.S.

Nykerion 'Kaca' Nealon has been charged with killing Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, who was shot outside his Dallas, Texas apartment block on March 4 as he played in the snow with his wife and brother-in-law.

Earlier that evening, Nealon had been at his girlfriend's apartment in a neighboring complex when shots were fired on her building. Nealon and three friends went to look for the possible shooter, police said at a press conference on Friday.

A witness told police that when they saw Al-Jumaili and his family outside their apartment block, Nealon raised his gun and fired.

'The witness stated he observed Nealon raise the rifle and he took cover behind some mailboxes,' said Dallas Police Major Jeff Cotner. 'The witness then heard one shot, followed by several more.'

After the shooting, Nealon and his friends returned to his girlfriend's home and called police to report the earlier shooting on her apartment.

Six days after the death, a witness went to the Richardson Police Department and gave them Nealon's nickname, 'Kaca', in connection to the crime.

He voluntarily spoke to police and admitted that he had been at the scene of the shooting, but he blamed another member of the group for firing the shots.

Found: Dallas Police Major Jeff Cotner, pictured next to Alia Salem of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Dallas, showed surveillance footage of Kealon at the scene of the crime on Friday

Thankful: Salem, standing beside the victim's emotional father-in-law Mohammed Altaae on Friday, thanked the police, the media and the community for their support and help in catching the alleged shooter

Police said evidence, including a distinguishable hat, pointed to him being the one carrying the firearm and ultimately firing the shots. 

A search of the apartment also yielded rifle cartridges that matched those at the scene. 

At the press conference on Friday, Major Cotner said they are continuing to investigate to see whether any charges should be brought against Nealon's friends.

He added that the group did not know Al-Jumaili or his family. 

Al-Jumaili's father-in-law, Mohammed Altaae, also appeared at the press conference but was too emotional to speak. He could be seen wiping his eyes as Alia Salem of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Dallas thanked the police and the media for their help. 

Devastated: His father-in-law Mohammed Altaae wept as he described how the young couple had just wanted to start building their life together after more than a year apart and have children together

'I know that he is grateful,' she said of Mr Altaee. 'We are just humbled by the community outpouring. 

'Our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this death... We just want to see justice happen here and this is the first step in that.'

Al-Jumaili's death is all the more tragic because, fearing the rise of ISIS, he had fled Iraq just weeks earlier. Once in Texas, he was reunited with his wife Zahraa, whom had left Iraq a year earlier. 

Before he was able to join her, Al-Jumaili worked hard providing Internet connections to Iraqi homes so he could head to America, according to his father-in-law Mohammed Altaae, CBS reported.

His wife had moved to the Dallas area to be near family members and her husband joined her just 20 days before he was murdered. He had a car and was looking for a job, his father-in-law said.

'For a young man and a young woman, oh God, so many dreams together,' Altaae told CBS. 'They wanted to have children and educate them well. It was the dreams of young people. 

Search: Police in Dallas released this security footage earlier this week as they looked for suspects

Investigation: Police said they are looking into whether they should bring charges against the other three 

'We're looking for safe place... What he got was a bullet in his heart.' 

Earlier this week, authorities released surveillance footage showing the four young men walking from the complex at the time of the shooting. 

No words were exchanged before the gunfire broke out.

Salem explained in an account on Facebook that Al-Jumaili had taken cover behind a pickup truck when the men opened fire - but a bullet pierced the truck and struck him.

Al-Jumaili was shot in the chest and ran towards the nearest building, where he collapsed.

He was rushed to hospital, where he passed away the following day. 

'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.' 

A LaunchGood fundraising page explains Al-Jumaili and Zahara married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State. 

Refuge: Just weeks earlier, the couple had been reunited as Al-Jumaili joined his wife in the United States

Truck: Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when shots rang out, but a bullet pierced straight through the truck (photographed) and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest

The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees. 

The fundraiser has raised more than $30,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund.

North Texas Crime Stoppers offered a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment.

Salem said the Council on American-Islamic Relations raised an additional $7,000 reward for information to help in the investigation into the killing.
