A convicted bank robber who was being sentenced for a dramatic escape from prison using bed sheets and dental floss told the judge: 'Take your analogy and shove it'.

Kenneth Conley smiled and winked as he listened to U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman give a lengthy explanation for sentencing him to a further three years on top of his current 20-year term.

Half-way through, he put his hand up and told the judge to 'shove it right up your ***'.

After a stunned silence, Judge Feinerman replied: 'Thank you'.

Conley was led away to serve the extra 41 months of his sentence for a case that has captivated Chicago.

A few days before Christmas 2012, Conley and his cellmate - fellow bank robber Joseph 'Jose' Banks - cut a hole in the concrete wall of the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

Then using a rope made from bed sheets and dental floss, they abseiled down 17 floors in the middle of the night and hailed a taxi to freedom.

Banks was arrested two days later, while Conley was at large for 18 days until he was found sleeping in a basement room of a Palos Hills apartment, it was reported by the Chicago Tribune.

Judge Feinerman refused to hand down a concurrent sentence to Conley for the break-out because of his 'incorrigble violent past' that he felt was unlikely to change.

He added: 'Doing what Mr Conley did takes brains, it takes ingenuity and it takes gumption.

'It shows that he is a force to be reckoned with.'

Federal prison officials said Conley, 40, will probably now serve his time at the 'supermax' prison in Colorado, where inmates include Gangster Disciples leader Larry Hoover and Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Prosecutors dropped escape charges against Banks, who already faces 80 years in jail for a string of bank robberies.
