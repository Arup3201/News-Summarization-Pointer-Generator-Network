Recommendations: Lord Heseltine is expected to make it harder for foreign companies to buy British firms

Tory divisions over how the get the economy moving are expected to be exposed this week when Lord Heseltine challenges the government to do more to bolster Britain’s regions.

The former deputy prime minister will publish a report proposing sweeping changes to the way local economies are run, drawing on his experience as a minister in Margaret Thatcher’s government.

The report on how to 
stimulate economic growth is expected to lead to a clash with the 
Coalition on a range of issues.

Days after figures showed Britain had emerged from the longest double-dip recession for 50 years, Mr Osborne is under pressure to ensure faltering economic growth continues.

Lord Heseltine is expected to criticise the jumble of Government schemes aimed at 
helping businesses weather the economic storm, and suggest giving local 
Chambers of Commerce more powers and public money.

The
Tory peer will also recommend 
cuts to red tape and some business taxes as well as a shake-up of local 
government.

Lord Heseltine’s report will be 
delivered to Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable on Wednesday,
but panicked officials are already holding meetings on how to respond 
to it.

He is expected to demand a public interest test to prevent foreign takeovers from damaging national interests, thousands of civil servants be moved out of London and the creation of new regional bodies in charge skills and training.

The proposals are said to have caused ‘discomfort in the Treasury’ with many of the ideas apparently advocating the recreation of Labour’s vast and costly Regional Development Agencies which the coalition scrapped.

The idea of setting up a new network of quangos would prove costly at a time when government is still under pressure to save billions of pounds.

Lord Heseltine, who has been given an office in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, is understood to advocate greater state intervention in local economies, favoured by Mr Cable, a Lib Dem minister.

One Whitehall source said: 'He is clear that the state can do more. Not Labour-style state subsidy, but also not the laissez-faire approach that some in government would prefer.'

Mr Osborne’s aides insist he is relaxed about the report, and expects to welcome much of its contents.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'We are very much looking forward to receiving it.'

Whitehall sources said that former 
deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine is likely to propose a tightening 
of the rules following a string of controversial bids for British firms.

The
move is expected to be resisted by senior ministers, who believe a 
political test for policing foreign ownership runs the risk of becoming 
protectionist.

Labour’s
2002 Enterprise Act introduced major reforms of the regime – including a
new competition test for assessing mergers and takeovers, to be used in
most cases.

This replaced a broader public interest test, which some are now arguing should be reintroduced.

Significantly, Mr Cable was in favour of the idea in opposition.

Days before the 2010 election, he said: 'It shouldn’t be nationalistic. The issue is not whether there is a foreign bidder, it’s about whether it’s in the interests of the British economy.

'The Government removed this provision in 2002 and we’re now seeing the damage done by opening up a complete free-for-all.

'We need to protect firms from takeovers forced through by hedge funds for short-term profit that’s not in the long-term interests of the British economy.'

'Cadbury law': A protester demonstrating outside the head office of Cadbury in Birmingham, in 2010 as the British confectioner said it had agreed to a £12bn takeover from U.S. giant Kraft

The reforms were dubbed the ‘Cadbury 
law’, after Kraft’s £12billion takeover of the British confectioner 
prompted a backlash from politicians and unions who argued it was too 
easy for foreign predators to snap up British companies.

Recently, there was controversy over a proposed merger between British defence giant BAE and European rival EADS.

The deal collapsed earlier this month but industry experts warn that BAE is vulnerable to a takeover approach.

Labour
leader Ed Miliband has suggested changes are needed to defend the 
long-term interests of British business against ‘fund managers chasing 
the fast buck’.

Lord Heseltine will also demand major
new powers and extra funding be handed to regional bodies, freed from 
control by ministers in London.

‘Whitehall has local authorities by the short and curlies and you have got to break that monopoly,’ he declared last year.

He is likely to call for an end to 
the two-tier council system, where district and county councils divide 
responsibility for services.

But Tory ministers have repeatedly 
criticised the idea of more unitary authorities running local areas. In 
May 2010 Communities Secretary Eric Pickles pulled the plug on unitary 
councils in Exeter and Norwich, branding them ‘ludicrous’ and an 
‘expensive distraction’.
