Students at Harvard University woke up on Friday to find inflammatory invitations had been pushed under their bedroom doors.

A sealed envelope contained a flyer inviting undergraduates to 'Harvard’s Newest Final Club' - one of the university's 14 exclusive single-sex social groups.

This new organization claimed to be called the Pigeon - two of the all-male clubs, the Owl and the Phoenix, are named after birds. It proclaimed a motto of 'Inclusion, Diversity, Love'. But each word was footnoted.

Inclusion had 'Jews need not apply.' Diversity was 'Seriously, no f******g Jews. Coloreds OK.' Love had 'Rophynol' - a misspelling of the date-rape drug rohypnol.

'Offensive': The invitation that was distributed in all nine Harvard River Houses in the early hours of Friday

The invitation claimed that the first meeting of the new club was at 11.02pm on December 13 at Berryline, a frozen yoghurt shop, and 'semi-bro attire' was required. The leaflets were distributed in nine dormitory houses.

Harvard Dean of Students Evelynn M. Hammonds reacted to the pamphlets by saying: 'I find these flyers offensive. They are not a reflection of the values of our community.

'Even if intended as satirical in nature, they are hurtful and offensive to many students, faculty and staff, and do not demonstrate the level of thoughtfulness and respect we expect at Harvard when engaging difficult issues within our community.'

No one has yet claimed responsibility for the incident but many at the university do believe that the flyers are satirical.

Harvard final clubs are controversial on campus as some consider them to be elitist and discriminatory.

As the Harvard Crimson reported in 2011, a similar under-the-door campaign (also used by the real clubs) asked students to think twice about joining a final club.

That leaflet asked undergraduates to consider the 'exclusivity, 'gender discrimination,' 'unequal access to social space on Harvard’s campus' and 'lack of transparency' of the clubs.

Concerns have also been raised about the safety of students at final clubs. In 2010 the Harvard Crimson expressed concerns about sexual assault at the clubs:

'When predatory sexual behavior at Harvard is discussed, the conversation
often turns to the all-male final clubs, whose parties are known for 
their free-flowing alcohol and lack of administrative supervision.'
