A grandmother who survived a 13-storey plunge down an elevator shaft finally overcame her fears and got back in the lift for the first time in 15 years - only to get stuck.

Pensioner Geraldine Tattam, now 65, her daughter and her then six-month-old granddaughter were lucky to escape with their lives when the cable snapped in the lift in a council block in Romford, north-east London, in 1999.

She vowed never to use an elevator again, but three weeks ago, after returning home with heavy shopping and facing a 196-step climb, she decided to chance it.

Geraldine Tattam got stuck in a lift in her council block, the first time she had used an elevator since a 13-storey plunge 15 years earlier

To her shock, the lift dropped several feet and stopped working, leaving the unlucky grandmother trapped.

Ms Tattam was stuck for more than two hours waiting for help to arrive because of a firefighters' strike. 

She said: 'I'm asthmatic and diabetic so I felt I had to use it. But when I was trapped I thought I was going to have a panic attack.

'I've just had enough now. It was a very scary experience.' 

It was the first time she had used a lift since her terrifying experience in 1999, when the emergency brakes kicked in moments before the carriage would have slammed into the ground, stopping the family just inches from almost certain death. 

The first lift accident saw Ms Tattam, her daughter Sarah-Jane  and her grandson Jake plummet from the 14th floor, where she lives, to the ground floor.

The grandmother said: 'It was terrifying, I've never experienced anything like it before.

We were all in such shock - and we got whiplash.

'I'd only been in the building about two weeks - it wasn't the best welcome.'

Ms Tattam, who made a full recovery after the first incident, developed an acute fear of using the lift and climbs 14 storeys of stairs to get to her flat.

Now Ms Tattam wants Havering Council to move her to a new building, preferably with a ground floor flat 

She said: 'For a long time I avoided the lift, because the memories were too scary.

'But last month I had just had enough, and couldn't manage carrying my shopping up almost 200 stairs on my own.

'I was panicking a bit, but as soon as the doors closed there was a loud bang and the entire thing dropped. I thought I was going to die.

'But it didn't fall very far and I was able to use the emergency button to call for help.

'Still, they took their time coming to rescue me - that was the longest two hours of my life.

'I want the council to give me a ground floor flat somewhere now. I'm never using a lift again.'  

The retired cleaner lives in the flat with her 36-year-old son, who said the lift had been making a funny 'groaning noise' for the last couple of weeks.

Havering Council, who manage the Highfield Towers building, say they will fix the lift and apologised to the shaken grandmother.

Deputy council leader Damien White said: 'We are really very sorry to hear that Ms Tattam was trapped in the lift.

'A combination of factors led to a delay in responding to this incident. A technician has since reviewed the condition of the lift and it is now fully working.

'This was a very unfortunate incident and we want to reassure tenants that this doesn't happen very often.'
