David Charles: The 21-year-old from Indiana allegedly stole human brains from a medical history museum

A 21-year-old man who allegedly stole human brains from a medical history museum has been arrested after another man who bought them online alerted authorities.

Indiana's David Charles was arrested on December 16 after investigators were tipped off by Brian Kubasco, from San Diego, who became suspicious about six jars of brain tissue he'd bought on eBay for $600.

Marion County court documents allege Charles broke into the Indiana Medical History Museum several times between September 7 and October 16 and stole jars of preserved human tissues, including brain samples, from long-dead psychiatric patients.

The museum is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital, Central State Hospital, which closed in 1994.

The museum's director executive director, Mary Ellen Hennessey Nottage, said the tissues are from autopsies spanning from roughly the 1890s to the 1940s.

'A museum's mission is to hold these materials as cultural and scientific objects in the public interest. To have that disturbed - to have that broken - is extraordinarily disturbing to those of us in the museum field,' she told The Indianapolis Star.

Indianapolis police had investigated several break-ins at the museum's storage facility before Kubasco helped lead police to Charles.

Kubasco called the Indianapolis museum after noticing labels on the containers that he bought on eBay, court documents state.

Stolen: About 60 human brains were reportedly stolen from the museum and 48 have been returned

Indianapolis police detectives traced the transactions and eventually spoke to the seller, Austin Rector.

Police said that Rector had obtained the brain matter from Charles.

Charles was busted during a police sting after Rector, the eBay middleman, arranged a meeting in a parking lot.

A man who drove Charles to the scene - 19-year-old Joshua Milan - allegedly reached for a handgun and was tackled by officers.

Court documents also state that the day before his arrest, Charles had stolen 60 jars of human tissue from the museum.

NBC Los Angeles reports 48 jars of human brain matter were recovered by police and returned to the medical museum.

Nottage said she's grateful much of the stolen material has been returned and that she spoke to Kubasco who tipped off the cops.

'He just said he liked to collect odd things,' she told The Star.

Charles faces charges of theft, marijuana possession and paraphernalia possession, according to court documents.

It is not clear if Milan, or others involved in the sting or sale of the human brains, will also be charged.
