Facing the axe: BBC2's daytime shows such as Flog It!, with Paul Martin,  and Cash In The Attic could be lost from schedules due to the Corporation's cuts

BBC2 will become the channel for repeats after the Corporation announced £1.3billion in cuts to ensure it no longer ‘takes the licence fee for granted’.

More than half the channel’s  schedule will be devoted to reruns as bosses try to end decades of empire-building by taking an axe to  ‘luxuries’ they can ‘no longer afford’.

Popular daytime shows at risk could include Cash in the Celebrity Attic and Flog It! Nearly all new daytime shows will now air on BBC1, which has been spared the brunt of the cuts.

But despite cuts of 20 per cent, the BBC will still enjoy an annual budget of £3.5billion.

The measures will lead to 2,000 redundancies – 800 in the news division – and the sale of Television Centre.

Yesterday’s report unveiling the cuts also revealed that the broadcaster will:

But the Corporation faced embarrassment after its chief operating officer Caroline Thomson appeared to compare closing a channel to the NHS shutting hospitals.

She said the BBC could not close any of its services because they were too valued by the public.

Asked if any other publicly funded organisation could justify saying this, she told Radio 4’s PM Programme: ‘Ask the NHS about the problem of closing hospitals.’

It was BBC2 – once best known for its pioneering arts, science and drama – that emerged as the major loser from the cutbacks.

Old shows will account for 56 per cent of its schedule. Hardly any new shows will appear before early evening, and prime time repeats will increase by 3 per cent.

During the day, apart from repeats, BBC2 will broadcast an international news bulletin, The Daily Politics and BBC World’s HardTalk.

TOM UTLEY: 'Mark Thompson seems to forget that down here in the real world, where cash is actually earned and spent, £3500 million can still go quite a long way. He seems more concerned with width than quality and I fear he may have blown his chance to save Auntie Beeb.'

The BBC will be saving £700million per year at the end of the five year process. It commissioned the Delivering Quality First report, which includes details of the cuts after the licence fee was last year frozen at £145.50 for six years.

The report envisages a ‘smaller and radically reshaped BBC’.  

It said: ‘By 2016, the BBC will be significantly smaller than it is today; employing fewer people; occupying far less space; and spending less money both absolutely and as a proportion of the UK broadcasting industry.’

BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said: ‘We should be able to run an outstanding public service broadcaster on a budget of £3.5billion.

‘It is a privilege to be funded by the public through the licence fee. This privilege should neither be abused or taken for granted.

‘With people and organisations everywhere in the UK obliged to pull in their belts, we cannot absolve ourselves at the BBC from the responsibility of responding to current economic realities.’

He said some things the BBC wanted to do were ‘luxuries’ that it ‘cannot afford’.

But unions bitterly condemned plans to axe thousands of jobs and threatened strike action.

They said more than 7,000 jobs had been lost at the BBC since 2004, adding that the situation ‘isn’t sustainable’.

Gerry Morrissey, of Bectu, the media and entertainment union, said: ‘They are destroying jobs, and destroying the BBC.’

The Corporation has vowed to drive down the number of senior managers so they account for just 1 per cent of the organisation. But this will still leave the final tally at around 200.

And staff axed as part of the job cuts could be back working at the BBC in as little as three months after the Corporation watered down its redundancy terms.

At present, staff have to wait 12 months before they can return. But this ‘cooling off’ period has been reduced to just three months. Critics said many of those who pick up pay-offs could simply walk back into  freelance deals within weeks  of leaving.

This would allow the BBC to make it look like it had taken tough action but actually offer workers a safety net. Elsewhere in the report, Radio 4 and BBC1 have been broadly protected from the axe with the Corporation’s output in natural history, popular science, drama and arts ring-fenced.

But as part of the savings late night TV shows, from 10.30pm, will be slashed, raising big questions over the future of programmes such as A Question of Sport.

It is understood flagship shows in these slots such as Question Time, Newsnight, Match of the Day and Graham Norton’s chat show will be protected.

BBC3 and BBC4 have been saved from be scrapped altogether.

Radio will also see more repeats, with Radio 2 and 5 Live cutting back comedy, and Radio 3 doing less drama and fewer lunch-time concerts.

Executives have also been told that spending on talent fees – one of the biggest expenditures for stations – needs to drop on Radio 1 and Radio 2, which could see big name stars axed when their contract is up for renewal.

Liberal Democrat MP Don Foster said: ‘I’m confident the BBC can save money while still preserving the high quality programming the public loves. It’s unfortunate that this has to happen and it is imperative that cuts should not lead to a lower quality BBC.’
