White Dee is facing a probe into her disability benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in Magaluf – while claiming to be too depressed to work.

The star of controversial TV Show Benefits Street has admitted to claiming Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is given to those too unwell to look after themselves day-to-day.

But Dee, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, was pictured energetically downing shots and pints of beers, while playing games with friends on a trip to Magaluf in Majorca last week.

White Dee is facing a probe into her disability benefits after being pictured cavorting with friends on holiday in Magaluf - while claiming to be too depressed to work

Dee, who starred in the Channel 4 documentary about life on benefits, has been spotted drinking champagne in a luxury hotel in Magaluf this week

The 42-year-old told the TV programme she has been left too depressed to work since her mother died

And while the criteria for being eligible for DLA include needing help cooking a main meal, her agent Barry Tomes last night told the Daily Mail that 42-year-old Dee is currently considering an offer to front a new cookery show.

‘What many people don’t know about Dee is that she is an amazing cook and has been offered her own cookery show,’ he said.

Other criteria to claim the DLA include needing ‘help with things like washing, dressing, eating, using the toilet or communicating your needs’.

The unemployed mother of two also claims she is too depressed to work.

But she is now set to face questions from the Department for Work on Pensions on her eligibility to receive the benefit and whether or not she is fit to work.

Under the current benefits regime, the reality TV star is allowed to undertake work and keep claiming DLA, which is a minimum of £21 a week.

It is now said the single mother-of-two will not face a quiz from benefits officials

And it is not against the rules to go on holiday if you are in receipt of the benefits.

But claimants must inform the DWP immediately if their condition changes, and proof that Dee is not in fact depressed could lead to an investigation into her payments.

However, Mr Tomes said he has recommended that Dee takes holidays in the sun to help her combat her depression so that she can get back into work.

He added that she has had seven offers from production companies in total, including from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, as well as three separate record deals, but has had to turn them down because she is ‘too unwell’.

‘It is like a light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can do,’ he said of her condition.

‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’  

Mr Tomes added that Dee, who is said to receive £10,000 a year in benefits, is preparing for two other all-expenses paid holidays – with her two children – to France next month, then to mainland Spain in July.

Her current trip saw her fly out to Spain on Wednesday last week, where she posed with £500 bottles of champagne and downed copious amounts of alcohol.

She was invited on the four-day holiday by another of her agent’s clients, an American singer. Together they attended a pub crawl organised by events firm, Carnage Magaluf. Alan Collinson, who organises the event and was pictured with Dee, is accused of attacking a groom and three members of his stag party, it was revealed last night.

It is not known if Dee was on the same bar crawl when the incident took place, but she was at the resort at the time.

Before the incident, Mr Collinson, 28, said that he didn’t know Dee had depression, adding: ‘She came across as a good laugh. She’s off out tonight with us on a bar crawl. I don’t think she is a big drinker though – she told me she prefers tea and biscuits.’

The DWP said that it would not discuss individual circumstances, but said they would make inquiries if evidence comes forward. It is not known what other benefits Dee claims, but she says she is not on Jobseeker’s Allowance.

She revealed she receives benefits of £214 a week, but has since said she would stop claiming the money if she started receiving an income, either because of the show or another job.

Although she worked as a barmaid, and was later a Birmingham council administrator, she left in disgrace after being convicted of stealing £13,000. 

She narrowly avoided jail in 2007 and was ordered to carry out 220 hours of unpaid work.

Jonathan Isaby, of the  TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Of course no-one in receipt of DLA should be denied the opportunity to enjoy themselves, but rigorous systems need to be in place to ensure that those receiving taxpayer-funded benefits genuinely require them.’
