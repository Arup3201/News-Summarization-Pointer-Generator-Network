Cleared: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, 57

A Spanish court has dropped a rape probe against a Saudi
prince who is one of the world's richest people, saying his accuser's
allegations are inconsistent.

The ruling clearing Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, 57, was
released today by a court in Palma, Majorca.

The drugging and sexual assault of a young Spanish model was
alleged to have occurred aboard a yacht moored at the island of Ibiza in the
early hours of August 12, 2008.

A judge on the popular resort island quietly closed the
probe in 2010, citing a lack of evidence.

However, a higher provincial court in the Balearic Islands,
which include Ibiza, accepted an appeal by the plaintiff and issued an order in
September 2011 instructing the same magistrate to resume the probe and question
the prince as a suspect.

The prince was listed 29th on the latest Forbes list of the
world's richest people, with a net worth of $18billion dollars (Â£11.3billion).

He is a leading investor in both Citigroup and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media
empire.

The prince said the court's final decision dismissing the
allegations vindicates his argument that he was not even in Ibiza that day but
rather in France with his wife, children, grandchildren and other witnesses.

The court in Palma said the accuser's version of events was
riddled with inconsistencies in her several appearances to give testimony.

It said the woman did not initially accuse the prince by
name as being her rapist. Rather, her lawyer did so much later. The court
called this is a 'procedural anomaly that since then has tainted the
entire investigation'.

The ruling also said she presented a photo of a group of
people purporting to identify the prince as the man who allegedly raped her.
There is an arrow pointing to a man in the background, and the word 'rapist' written there. But the prince is standing in the foreground,
in front of that man.

The ruling says when asked about this, the accuser said it
was her mother who drew the arrow on that and several other photos.

The court said it also found it noteworthy that the woman
took 48 hours to report the alleged rape to the Spanish authorities.

Given her inconsistencies 'we cannot establish with any
solidity whatsoever, even circumstantially, what happened' on the night of
the alleged incident, the court declared.

The prince, in a statement, reiterated he had not even heard
of the case against him until it was resurrected last September.

'No one's character should be subject to such dishonest
attacks,' the statement said.

It said the prince is pursuing criminal actions against the
accuser, her mother and their lawyer, and professional sanctions against the
lawyer for unethical behaviour.
