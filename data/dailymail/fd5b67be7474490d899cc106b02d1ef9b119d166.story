The family of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s late wife has hired a high-powered investigation firm to look into ‘unanswered questions’ about her death, according to reports.

Mary Richardson’s relatives have asked Washington-based Investigative Group International to see if the suicide on May 16 was actually a ‘wrongful death’.

The company - which was hired by Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal -  is said to have assigned a former homicide prosecutor to the case which will also examine Mr Kennedy’s movements in the days before.

Tragic: The family of Mary Richardson Kennedy, who was married to Robert F Kennedy Jr, has hired a powerful law firm to investigate her death

The explosive development opens the 
door to the Richardson family bringing an unlawful death lawsuit against
Mr Kennedy because they believe he is in part responsible for her 
demise.

The reports suggest Miss Richardson’s
family are not convinced by the official account of what happened on 
the day of her death, which a coroner ruled was suicide by hanging.

They had already gone to court in a 
bitter row with the Kennedys over what would happen to Miss Richardson’s
body after her death.

Both families claimed ownership but a
judge ruled for the Kennedys and she was buried in the family plot in 
Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

There is no suggestion whatsoever that Mr Kennedy has been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to his wife’s death.

Her family have also not filed a wrongful death lawsuit against him - so far.

But according to the New York Post, 
Investigative Group International has already begun looking at details 
of the hanging itself, which took place at Miss Richardson’s $3.5million 
mansion in upstate New York.

A key issue is said to be whether or 
not Miss Richardson could have tied the complicated knot that was used 
on the noose she was found hanging from.

The firm hired by the Richardson family to investigate RFK Jr has close ties to the Democrat party and once worked for the late Ted Kennedy.

Investigative Group International was also hired by former president Bill Clinton to dig up dirt on the prosecutors who tried to impeach him during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

At the time the company was dubbed ‘Bill Clinton’s private CIA’.

Ted Kennedy hired the firm when he was a Senator for Massachusetts - but it will now investigate another leading member of Kennedy clan.

IGI was founded in 1984 by longtime Washington operator Terry Lenzner and has amassed a long list of corporate, political and celebrity clients who have asked it to undertake ‘opposition research’, or what critics say is digging up dirt on people.

Mike Tyson hired the firm to look into whether or not jurors who convicted him of rape had acted inappropriately.

Ivanka Trump used its services to look into her love rival Marla Maples, who was married to real estate mogul Donald Trump before she was.

In the early 1990s, Lenzner also investigated the Paula Jones case for the Clinton camp.

The firm however has seen controversy and in 2000 it was caught going through the trash of think tanks that had backed Microsoft.

At the time IGI had been employed by Microsoft rival Oracle - it reportedly paid janitors $1,200 to hand over the rubbish.

Lenzner is a former federal prosecutor who became known on Capitol Hill as co-chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in 1972. His powerful friends from the time include author and journalist Cokie Roberts and former Senator Tim Worth.

New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly once worked for the firm which on its website claims it merely engages in ‘conducts confidential fact-finding investigations with the utmost discretion’.

Lenzner himself has said there is ‘nothing nefarious’ about his work but neighbours have said he has a ‘dark side that’s pretty scary’.

Another line of inquiry is how she was able to get up a 12ft beam in the garage to tie it.

It had been thought she used a metal ladder but now it appears she could have used three boxes to climb up there instead.

Investigators are also hunting for 
receipts for the rope she used as they try to answer the question: ‘Was 
there a platform she could stand on?’

The most explosive part of the 
inquiry deals with ‘establishing Bobby’s activities and whereabouts in 
the days preceding Mary’s death.’

One of Miss Richardson’s closest 
advisors has already been questioned about her state of mind and their 
fractured relationship which had grown toxic.

A friend of Miss Kennedy is said to 
have told the investigation firm: ‘It was definitely my impression that 
they [the Richardsons] were pursuing a wrongful-death action.

‘They had the same concerns I had about the crime scene.’’

Mrs Kennedy and her husband got 
married in 1994 and had four children together aged between ten and 17, 
but they split in May 2010, never finalising the divorce.

Three days after the breakup Miss Richardson was arrested for driving under the influence near her home. Her mugshot from the time showed her looked bedraggled and a shadow of her former glamorous self.

Mr Kennedy, 58, a prominent 
environmental lawyer, was given custody over their children but Miss 
Richardson, who was clinically depressed and battled drink and drug 
problems for years, contested it.

In court documents which have been 
made public Mr Kennedy claimed she threatened to commit suicide or make 
false claims about him to the police if he tried to leave her.

During one particularly disturbing 
episode she ran over the family dog and hit Mr Kennedy 30 times before 
calling him a ‘demon’ in front of their ten-year-old son.

Mr Kennedy is the son of former US Attorney General Robert F Kennedy who was assassinated in 1968.

He is now dating Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines.

According to police records he told 
detectives that in a conversation between them the night before she died
Miss Richardson ‘asked me to pray for her’.

Mr Kennedy said: ‘She told me that 
she was sorry for everything... She said that I was right about 
everything, and everything was her fault.

‘She then told me that she needed me to take care of her’.

RFK Jr declined to comment and Investigative Group International failed to respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for Miss Richardson’s 
family said: ‘The Richardson family continues to grieve for their sister
Mary, and they have no comment at this time.
