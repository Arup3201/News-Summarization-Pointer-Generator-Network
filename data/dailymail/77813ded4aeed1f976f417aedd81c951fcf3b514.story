Wedding plans: Brian Frain is facing jail for bigamy, but says he wants to marry for a third time to Donna Darwent

A bigamist facing jail, after it was revealed he was married to two women at the same time, says he can’t wait to serve his sentence - so that he is free to marry again.

Brian Frain, 36, was rumbled by first wife Anne-Marie Sim when she saw pictures of his second wedding - to Margaret Meredith - on Facebook, seven years after they separated.

He claimed that he had married for a second time, because he thought the marriage was automatically voided as they were separated.

But even after he was arrested and prosecuted, Frain, from Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire, claims to have fallen in love again.

He adds that he can’t wait to marry third wife, mum-of-four Donna Darwent, 33, despite still waiting for his divorces to be finalised.

Frain said: 'I will take my punishment, because I know when I come out of prison, I will be with the love of my life.

'I have done the crime, so I have to take the punishment.

'I have held my hands up from day one. I did do it, but I did not do it deliberately.

'I assumed that after seven years apart, the marriage was void.

'I have since learned that it costs £45 and you may have to wait a couple of years if you do not get the person’s consent.'

He added: 'Donna has made me grow up a lot. She has helped me through my ups and downs and made me a better person.'

Frain married Anne-Marie Sim at Tameside Register Office, Dukinfield, Manchester, in June 1999 after a two-month whirlwind romance.

They separated after two months and she moved to Scotland.

Five years later she attempted to get in touch with Frain to seek a divorce as she wanted to re-marry.

She contacted solicitors and hired a firm to track him down, but they couldn’t locate him.

Eventually,
Mrs Frain turned detective herself and hunted him down through Facebook
- where she saw the wedding pictures of his marriage in September 2009 
to Margaret Louise Meredith, whom he had met two years earlier.

Frain and Margaret had twins, and then married at the same register office where he had married Anne-Marie, ten years earlier.

He told Thameside Magistrates’ Court that he had informed his second wife he had been married before, but the district judge said he did not believe him and accused him of deceiving Margaret Louise.

A statement written by Ms Meredith was also read out to the court, which said: 
'Although I had been married before, I was under the impression that 
this was Brian’s first marriage.

'The wedding went well. I truly believed that I was his first wife. This has obviously affected me.'

The case was adjourned for sentencing on September 12.

Frain admitted he had affairs during his relationship with his second wife and decided to leave her.

He said: 'I broke away from Margaret and started a relationship with Donna.'

He said he experienced problems with access to the twins born from their relationship.

Brian claimed: 'I cut all ties. That is why we moved to Cleethorpes.

'The first I knew there was a problem was in March when I was arrested at Cleethorpes Police Station.

'I am quite nervous. It could mean prison, but I want to move on and once it is all over I plan to marry Donna.

'I regret all that has happened. I have had to cut all ties with my second wife, which means losing the twins.

'But they are going to grow up and know their own minds and make their own decisions when they are older.

'So long as they know I have not abandoned them and what I did was for the best.'

He said the strain had taken its toll on the relationship between him and Donna and both have been prescribed anti-depressants.

Donna said: 'When this is done with we hope to pick up where we left off and get our lives back.

'I always said I would never marry. But I have never been settled before and never met my perfect partner.

'Then Brian came along and he has changed completely. My kids love him to bits. They see him as their father. I am committed enough to marry him.'

Impact: In a statement read to the court, Margaret Meredith spoke of how her husband's bigamy affected her

Frain added: 'I let everyone know to be very careful and think about what they are doing and not rush into anything.

'Make sure you know your partner and discuss what you both want, otherwise it could be a lot of heartache and trouble, particularly if there are children.'

Frain said he is finally getting a divorce from his first wife and has sought legal advice.
