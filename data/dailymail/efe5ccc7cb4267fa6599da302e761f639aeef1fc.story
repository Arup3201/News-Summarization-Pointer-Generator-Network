Embarrassed: Coventry Council leader John Mutton has apologised after suggesting raising a flag with a smiley face on it during Baroness Thatcher's funeral

The Labour leader of a city council 
told his colleagues he would like to fly a flag with a ‘happy smiling 
face’ on it on the day of Baroness Thatcher’s funeral.

Amid a continuing surge of hatred from
the Left in response to the former prime minister’s death, the leader 
of Left-wing Coventry council John Mutton wrote to his colleagues to ask
whether they thought the town hall flag should be lowered to half-mast 
on the day of the funeral.

He wrote that personally he would rather ‘fly a flag with a happy smiling face on’.

Another Labour colleague  responded that he ‘would have preferred to see her hanging from a flag pole’.

The messages emerged after one of the 
politicians mistakenly sent the email thread to all the councillors in 
the city, including disgusted Conservative councillors.

Coventry is among several Labour-led 
councils who are refusing to lower the flags on council buildings as a 
mark of respect during Lady Thatcher’s funeral on Wednesday.

Rotherham council insisted it was ‘not
a day of national mourning’, while Wigan council said it would not 
lower its flag as feelings toward Lady Thatcher’s policies ‘remain 
strong and raw’.

Labour-run Manchester council and 
Sheffield council, which both have no Conservative councillors, have 
also refused to carry out the gesture.

South Tyneside council echoed other 
councils who said that they would not fly flags at half-mast because 
they had ‘received no official instruction from the  Cabinet Office’.

In the email sent on Thursday at 
1.57pm, Mr Mutton wrote to his party colleagues: ‘Whilst I have had to 
smile at some of the jokes doing the rounds following the death of 
Thatcher, it has been brought to my attention that normally, following 
the death of a former prime minister, we receive an instruction from the
Queen telling us to fly the Union Flag at half-mast.

‘I would like to gauge the views of 
comrades. My own view is that I would fly a flag with a happy smiling 
face on.’ In response, Labour councillor Dave Chater wrote: ‘Would have 
preferred to see her hanging from a flag pole in the early 80s! A 
definite no from me.’

But instead of sending the message just to his ‘comrades’, Mr Chater accidentally sent the thread to all councillors.

Coventry’s Tory leader Kevin Foster 
said: ‘While some did not agree with Margaret Thatcher’s policies, this 
sort of glee at her death says more about the two councillors concerned 
than it does about her.’

Last night Mr Chater was unrepentant, saying he was ‘ashamed’ of Lady Thatcher.

Mr Mutton said: ‘If offence has been caused, to anyone, I very much regret it.’
