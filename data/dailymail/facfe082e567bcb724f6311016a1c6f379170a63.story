Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week sees a Manchester City midfielder and new West Ham signing stealing the headlines 

1. James Milner has made a big breakthrough in Manuel Pellegrini’s thinking after being named to start against both Arsenal and Chelsea.

The England midfielder made just 10 Premier League starts last season and not one was against a top four team, but Manchester City’s manager is clearly ready to put more trust in the 28-year-old.

He justified his new status, playing in three different positions as City adjusted to having ten men before he then provided the pass for Frank Lampard’s late equaliser.

2. Alex Song’s arrival at West Ham will give Mark Noble a new lease of life to play a more attacking role in Sam Allardyce’s plans.

One club man Noble has been anchored in a defensive midfield position for some time, but having Song behind him meant 24 of the 34 accurate passes he played against Liverpool were in the attacking half.

He made the switch count – making one goal and setting up three more chances in the 3-1 win over Brendan Rodgers’ team.

3. With a capacity of just 18,360 Queens Park Rangers already have the disadvantage of the smallest stadium in the Premier League – so it must be an additional worry that they can’t fill it.

Just 16,163 saw Niko Kranjcar’s free kick rescue a 2-2 draw – and even allowing that Stoke brought only 1,028 fans to go in the 1,900 capacity away end that still leaves 1,325 home seats unsold.

Full price tickets started at £30 – but were trading for as little as £17 on the club’s official viagogo site.

4. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has mostly been a bit part player for Arsenal this season – he’s appeared in all nine games but the win at Aston Villa was only the second time he’s started a Premier League game.

The 78 minutes he completed before getting subbed was the most he’s played in the League since last March but there were signs he could be pushing for more.

His neat touch started the move from which Mesut Ozil got the Gunners’ first goal, and he found a team mate with 46 of his 55 passes.

5. Mohamed Diame moaned about not getting more chance to play in central midfield at West Ham and has done his best to make his point since joining Hull.

The Senegal international’s brilliant finish at Newcastle proved he’s got a shot in both feet – with a left foot rocket following up his right foot finish against the Hammers last Monday.

Maybe if he’d shown more of that quality at Upton Park last season he’d have got more opportunities to play in his favourite role – he got just four goals in the entire campaign.

6. Papiss Cisse got the headlines for the two goals that rescued Alan Pardew from another calamity but the player who worked his socks off most to save the boss was midfielder Jack Colback.

The free transfer capture from neighbours Sunderland, hailed by Roy Hodgson as the 'ginger Andrea Pirlo' when he was picked for the England squad, covered 7.8 miles against Hull – the furthest run by any Premier League player on Saturday.

He gave quality as well as quantity – with a 95.3 per cent passing success rate.

7. David Moyes was always a bit old school at Everton when it came to using a minimum of substitutes – and his former number two Alan Irvine has picked up some of the same habits.

Irvine, feeling his way into his first job as a Premier League boss at West Brom, stuck with his starting line-up at Tottenham right the way through to the 89th minute when he swapped Victor Anichebe for Stephane Sessegnon to waste a bit of time to hang on to.

Every other top flight side sent on three subs this weekend – apart from Stoke and Swansea who both used two.

8. Jose Mourinho’s decision to trust his former Real Madrid assistant Aitor Karanka with the development of young striker Patrick Bamford looks like paying dividends.

The 21-year-old, who got 25 goals in 53 games on loan for MK Dons and Derby last season, marked his full Middlesbrough debut by scoring in the 4-0 demolition of Brentford.

England Under 21 striker Bamford is due back at Stamford Bridge in January when Mourinho wants him to compete for a place in Chelsea’s first team squad.

9. Alex McLeish’s first attempt to rebuild his management career after getting sacked by Aston Villa was a disaster when he walked out of Nottingham Forest after just 41 days – but his next go in Belgium looks more promising.

The former Scottish boss is unbeaten in three games in charge of FC Genk and got his first win on Saturday night when his side ended the 100 per cent home record of Mouscion-Peruweiz with a 2-1 win.

10. Keith Curle might have been out of work for 19 months since getting rather harshly sacked by Notts County but clearly hasn’t forgotten how to deliver a half time team talk.

The 50-year-old former England defender, who has taken the tough job of bossing Carlisle in 92nd place in the League, watched his new club go 3-0 down by the break against promotion hopefuls Mansfield.

A few well chosen words inspired a fight back that got them within a whisker of rescuing a point at 3-2. 'I just said I wanted to see if they could come back in at the end, look me in the eye, and tell me they’d had a go,' Curle explained.

It's been a long wait for new Carlisle boss Keith Curle to return to the touchline
