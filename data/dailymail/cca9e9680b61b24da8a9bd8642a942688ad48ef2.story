Fundraiser: Claire Squires collapsed and died while taking part in the London Marathon in April

Former athlete Katharine Merry, who won bronze in the women's 400m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, tweeted: 'Thoughts are with the family of a runner who died today in the #greatbirminghamrun'

A record field of 18,000 runners took part in the 13.1-mile race through Birmingham, taking on a course passing some of the city's most famous landmarks including the Bullring, the Cadbury’s factor in Bourneville and Edgbaston cricket ground.

The tragedy happened six months after another runner, Claire Squires, collapsed and died a mile from the end of the London Marathon.

Miss Squires, 30, of Leicestershire, took part in the marathon to raise money for the Samaritans in memory of her brother Grant, who died of a drug overdose ten years ago, aged 25.

More than 80,000 people have donated to the charity through Miss Squires's JustGiving fundraising page since her death, pledging more than £1.1million.
