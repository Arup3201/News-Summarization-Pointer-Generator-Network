Keep an eye out for these two canine trick-or-treaters this Halloween.

Lemon beagles Cute Dog Maymo and Puppy Penny have gone to town with their oufits this year, as displayed in a new YouTube video that has more than 100,000 views so far.

In a series of ever-more ridiculous Halloween costumes, the two dogs wait patiently on a front doorstep for their reward.

Their trick-or-treating bucket is filled with various inappropriate 'treats' including handcuffs, cigarettes and a mallard.

A box of popcorn receives the most enthusiastic response, while a bunch of bananas solicits less interest.

As for the costumes, there are more than 10.

Cute Dog Maymo makes a particularly convincing Princess Leia. His companion, Puppy Penny, is a somber Chewbacca.

The 'Star Wars' theme is also explored with a Darth Vader costume for Maymo and Yoda for Penny.

There's also ape costumes, a particularly adorable Russian-dolls-style teddy bear outfit and tigers.

Teletubbies and koalas round out the elaborate display.

Cute Dog Maymo has his own Twitter feed, on which he enlightens his followers about his latest hijinks (hint: a lot of them involve costumes) and a Facebook page that features Maymo and his sister Penny.

According to Maymo's YouTube channel, he was born in 2011, his favorite drink is coconut water and his favorite toy is a battery operated mouse.
