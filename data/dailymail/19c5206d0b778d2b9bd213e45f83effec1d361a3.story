One of the richest Asian businessmen 
in Britain and boss of an £800 million hotel chain today won his High 
Court battle to deny his elderly father’s claim to a share of his family
 wealth.

Jasminder 
Singh the 63-year-old head of the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotels group 
successfully defended his 87-year-old father Bal Mohinder Singh’s claim 
that under Sikh tradition he was entitled to a third of the family 
wealth.

Father and 
son still live in the same seven-bedroom country house Tetworth Hall 
near Ascot racecourse, Berkshire, with their families.

Bal Mohinder Singh, photographed alongside a carer in central London told the High Court his case was not about money but because his son Jasminder had abandoned his Sikh traditions

Jasminder Singh (above) claimed that he did not have a particularly religious upbringing and disputed his father's claim that he was entitled to a one-third share of the hotel empire

Despite living together in the same house, Mr Singh sought a one-third share of the family business.

The father who is suffering from ill health and gave his evidence from a
 hotel claimed that family property is covered by a constructive trust.

His counsel John McDonnell QC told the judge Sir William Blackburne: 'The father is not claiming a share of any of Jasminder’s wealth 
acquired by his own efforts. It is our claim that Jasminder’s wealth is 
the family’s wealth. The only cash put into the family’s empire is that 
put in by the father in the 70s.'

Jasminder is said to be worth around £415 million. But the court claim was said to be worth about £50m.

But the father has said the claim is not about the money but about 
tradition and his son’s failure to abide by the 'Mitakshara' system from
 Sikh and Hindu traditions which implies a sharing of family wealth.

Mr Singh, pictured above with a carer, told a special sitting of the High Court that he his friends will be 'shocked' that his son is claiming credit for the family's success

The judge was asked to decide as a preliminary issue, if the family 
property is subject to any constructive trust under English law, and if 
so what the terms of such a trust were.

If he decided that such a trust was binding there would be another 
trial to decide how much is due, if agreement cannot be reached.

But in a long written judgment the judge on what he described as a 'most unusual' case, dismissed the father’s claim.

He added: 'Although I have rejected father’s claim, it by no means 
follows that I regard him or mother as having in any way acted 
dishonestly in making it . On the contrary , they struck me as having 
advanced this claim in all good faith believing it to be well founded.

'The root of the difference between them was in their upbringings with 
the father being raised in rural British India and the mother in Kenya. 
But Jasminder completing his education in the UK and taking “little 
interest in the religious side of Sikhism.'

Father
 and son turned a small family post office business in Stamford Hill, 
North London back in 1973 into the multi million hotel group.

His
 son helped in the business and after he qualified as an accountant they
 moved into hotels, buying a rundown B&B in Kensington, West London,
 which they refurbished and sold on at a profit.

They
 gradually traded up and bought a string of upmarket hotels, building up
 a multi million pound group which includes the Vanderbilt and the Savoy
 Court in central London.

But the father claimed his son forced him to retire in 2010 and now 
refuses to follow tradition by sharing the family wealth.

The father lives at Tetworth Hall with his 81-year-old wife and Jasminder’s mother Satwant who is backing his claim.

Jasminder also lives there with his wife Amrit and their four children.

In a witness statement in the court proceedings his father said: 'Both I
 and his mother are deeply ashamed that Jasminder should publicly 
renounce his cultural heritage and the mutual rights and obligations in 
which he was brought up.

'That
 family system based on custom and religious teaching is widely 
practised and universally understood by Hindus and Sikhs in India today 
just as it was in British India where I was brought up.

'It
 is also widely practised and universally understood in the Sikh and 
Hindu communities overseas including East Africa and the UK.

'My
 life has been devoted to winning respect for myself and family in those
 communities and the respect which we have earned as a family has been 
the basis for the success of our business in this country.

Jasminder and his wife Amrit continue to live with his parents despite the dispute

'For
 Jasminder to deny that and claim all the credit and ownership for 
himself will be shocking to wide sections of those communities 
particularly our family friends - that is why his mother and I are so 
ashamed.'

But Jasminder 
claimed in evidence that he did not have a particularly religious 
upbringing, that neither of his parents regarded the family to be living
 under an agreement to share property nor was there any such agreement.

The
 judge commented: 'If nothing else this litigation has highlighted the 
extraordinary enterprise that has enabled the Singh family , in the 
space of just two generations, to rise from obscurity and very modest 
circumstances in what was then rural British India, overcome all manner 
of difficulties, come eventually to this country and make a fortune for
 itself.                                          

'I
 dare say it is not untypical of many such families but there can be few
 whose rise has been quite so meteoric. The family’s story as it 
unfolded in the course of this trial has a heroic quality to it. It has 
made it all the more painful to have to listen to the tragic differences
 that now divide its members.'The court was forced to travel to the May Fair Hotel off Piccadilly - which is owned by the family - to hear evidence from Bal Mohinder Singh.

He was considered too frail to travel to the Royal Courts of Justice near Fleet Street. The Singh family said they would cover the costs of the special hearing so as not to cost the taxpayer any money.

The court heard that Bal Mohinder Singh had grown up in rural British India while his wife was  from Kenya. His son Jasminder went to Christian mission schools in Kenya and completed his education in the UK.
