Kendall Jenner is enveloped in wires that surround her neck, faces and eyes in a striking new magazine cover.

But the 19-year-old did not have to endure being wrapped up in steel for the shoot - as it was all created thanks to computer trickery. 

Kendall's cover is one of five special editions of Garage magazine and a 3D version has also been brought to life, which you can see in the video below.

Cara is stunning in her bare-faced cover, with the blue from the design highlighting the colour of her eyes 

Top model Lara Stone's cover is perhaps the most dramatic, with her face encased in a plastic mask

Models Cara Delevingne, Binx Walton, Joan Smalls and Lara Stone are also given the CGI treatment by the publication.

Each is pictured wearing new Royals Collection of headphones from BEATS, and all look stoically at the camera in the highly stylised shoot. 

Cara appears to have tape around her neck and chin, Joan is seemingly licked in purple flames and Lara's face looks like it's covered in a plastic mask. 

Pat McGrath and CHAOS FASHION creatively directed the covers which also see Binx's face half covered in a growth of purple crystals.

Each of the top models has a bare-faced look for their cover, allowing the high impact designs to take full effect. 

In an innovative first for a magazine cover, the incredible looks were created using CGI, or computer animation.

Readers of the magazine can download an app, which when teamed with the magazine, will allow them to see additional images and even hear themed music for each cover.
