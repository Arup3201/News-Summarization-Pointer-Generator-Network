'It's absolutely tragic. They were having a big gathering over the weekend for family and friends and lots of people have been going round to the house.

Chad McVeigh was also killed in the crash, which happened on Friday at the West Wiltshire Trading Estate in Westbury

Flowers lined the side of Quartermaster Road, Westbury, Wiltshire, where the friends died on Friday

'I don't know who was driving or where they were going, but this is the third fatal crash in less than a month, with five young people dead. It has got to stop.'

It is believed the friends were on their way to popular nightclub Club Ice in Quartermaster Road.

One tribute to Chad, a pupil at Matravers School in Westbury, described him as 'beautiful young man'

The men are due to be formally identified tomorrow.

The alarm was raised by a passing motorist who dialled 999 as well as the lorry driver who had been asleep in his cab when the car slammed into the rear of the 44-ton truck.

The three victims had all suffered multiple fatal injuries and were certified dead in the car. Their bodies had to be cut free by firefighters who were called to the scene by the police.

The bodies were understood to have later been removed to the mortuary at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, where post-mortem examinations will be carried out early next week.

Wiltshire Police, who were understood to have received information from other drivers who were at the scene at the time of the collision, said that the manner of driving of the Citroen car would form part of their investigation into the cause of the tragic crash.

A spokesman declined to comment on rumours that the car had been travelling too fast for the conditions or that it was being driven 'inappropriately.' 

He also said that police were trying to discover whether the young men had been heading towards Club Ice nightclub or whether they had been on the trading estate for a different reason.

It is the third fatal smash in Wiltshire in less than a month. 

On November 15, passenger Max Lewis, 19, died in a collision between a car and a van near Melksham, while a week later, 21-year-old Max Pearson was killed when his car hit a tree in the Savernake Forest near Marlborough.
