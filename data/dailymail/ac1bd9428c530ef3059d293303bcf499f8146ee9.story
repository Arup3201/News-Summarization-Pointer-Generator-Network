It wasn't quite Oprah Winfrey vs Lance Armstrong, but in his first interview since news of his positive test for cocaine, UFC champion Jon Jones apologised for the 'embarrassing situation' and insisted he is not a drug addict.

Jones failed a routine test on December 4, a month before he made an eighth successful defence of his light-heavyweight title against Daniel Cormier.

The results of the test were released three days after his victory before Jones checked himself into rehab and was later fined $25,000 (£16,520) by the UFC. 

UFC light heavyweight champion spoke to Fox Sports 1 in his first interview since failing a drug test

The 27-year-old spoke for the first time during a 13-minute interview with Fox Sports 1.

'I'm not here to make excuses for what happened,' he said. 'A coward would sit here and try to come up with an elaborate reason or try to blame something. I'm not going to blame my friends or pressure.

'I did it at a party; I messed up. It wasn't a mistake because I consciously did it.'

Jones admitted it wasn't the first time he had dabbled in the drug.

'I've dibbed and dabbed in my fair share of partying, lets say,' he said.

'The drug was introduced to me in college. It's not my thing, I don't know what came over me.

'The whole situation has been really embarrassing.

'I had to explain to so many people that I'm not a cocaine addict and not even a frequent user.

'I got caught with my pants down.' 

Jones is the UFC's light-heavyweight champion and the promotion's pound-for-pound No 1 fighter

Jones admitted that the day of the test had been 'nerve-wracking' because he knew he was likely to fail the test.

But having told nobody about his fears, and having heard nothing about it by the time he weighed in for his fight, thought it might not have been picked up.

Jones was at home with his family in Alberqurque when UFC president Dana White called with the news.

'My mum was one of the first people I called,' he said.

'It went better than I thought it would, she was very supportive. She said she didn't care about my athletic career and being a celebrity, she cared about me. She asked how big an issue it was and I told her it wasn't a problem.'

Jones then entered rehab but was criticised for appearing to stay for just 24 hours.

'Going to rehab was a collective decision between me and my business parters,' he explained.

'I did a 24-hour evaluation where I spoke to three doctors for about seven hours. We spoke about drugs and the role it played in my life.

'They came to the conclusion that I didn't need to be an in patient.

'They put me in an out patient house and I stayed there the next day with a bunch of addicts. 

Jones outpointed his rival Cormier earlier this month to make an eighth successful defence of his belt

'The counsellor sat me down and said he believed I made a big mistake and that I didn't need to live here with us.

'They test me on a weekly basis and our counselling sessions will be once, twice, even three times a week.

'When I went to rehab I was willing to stay there as long as I needed to be.'

Jones concluded the interview by insisting that he would learn from the experience.

'I'm not going to sit here and say I'll never have a drink again or enjoy life,' he said. 'I think there are a lot of people out there who can relate to me.

'The important thing is to learn that when we fall down to get back up and not beat yourself up about it.

'My message to my fans is that I'm really sorry for maybe betraying their belief and letting them down.

'I've let myself down, my family, my team, the UFC and my fans.'
