California has an estimated 15.4 billion barrels of crude oil beneath its fertile farmland - and now companies are scrambling to get their hands on it, putting the lush landscape in danger.

While the 'Monterey Shale' has long been believed to be under 1,750 square miles of central and southern California, technology is finally able to extract it, potentially sparking a huge oil boom.

But the oil could also prove a 
massive area of conflict between the oil companies and the state's 
powerful environmental interests, as campaigners protest against the use
 of fracking to extract it.

There
 are also fears that the fertile landscape will be taken over by looming
 drills and oil sites, pushing out vineyards, endangering rare species and flattening the rolling hills.

But amid the concerns, companies are staking their 
claim on the shale, quietly buying up mineral rights and 
carrying out tests across the state - all behind a veil of secrecy.

If
 companies can extract it, it will turn the state from the third biggest
 producer of oil to the first - as the Monterey Shale has four times as 
much oil as Texas, currently the biggest producer.

Companies have be unable to reach the oil before now because tectonic activity folded the rock and pushed oil into layered pockets that are expensive to reach.

The oil is also 6,000 to 15,000 feet beneath the surface, while in other areas, like Midway-Sunset in California, companies need only drill up to 2,000 feet.

In December, Exxon Mobil Corp. 
predicted that the U.S. will become an oil exporter by 2025, due to an 
increase in production and energy efficiencies.

Texas is the top producer of crude oil and its on the increase; in 
September, the state's crude-oil production reached two million barrels per day, while production in 2011 was 1.5 million barrels per day.

North Dakota produced 728,000 barrels of oil a day in September, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

California takes the third place for production, with 524,000 barrels of oil a day in September. Despite this central role in oil production, it has some of the highest gas prices in the nation.

Alaska is the fourth largest producer, with 502,000 barrels a day in September, and Oklahoma produced 250,000 barrels, putting it in fifth place, according to the EIA.

But technological advances have now made extracting the Monterey Shale more likely, theÂ New York Times reported, and old and new companies are swooping in to stake a claim.

Mineral rights to public lands are being sold by the Bureau of Land Management and plots have soared from $2 an acre to more than a thousand dollars each.

The successful bidders have 10 years to develop a working oil well on the land or the lease expires, NBC News explained. The government receives 12.5 per cent of revenues from the oil.

'It's good for us,' Gabe Garcia, an assistant field officer for the Bureau of Land Management, told NBC. 'Last year we brought in $190 million.'

Companies have begun drilling holes northwest of Bakersfield to see if they hit the jackpot, keeping quiet about what, when and how they're exploring - as well as what they find.

'Our companies are not forthcoming on 
their business plans,' said Tupper Hull from the Western States Petroleum Association, which represents companies including Occidental and Venoco. 'These are pretty smart people, they're pretty good at what they do. 
They're pretty competitive out there.'

And while little has been revealed about the success of the searches, still they continue.

'There are billions of barrels of oil
 buried in the Monterey Shale, and as far as I know, nobody's been able 
to find it yet,' Neil Ormond, the president of Petroleum Land 
Management, told the Times.

'But I think there's going to be more
 people looking for it. You can't let a few dry holes discourage the 
whole thing, because if you find oil, you make money.'

But as well as exciting oilmen, the Monterey Shale has also sprung environmentalists into action.

To extract the oil, companies would use hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the drilling technique used in booms elsewhere - but campaigners deem unsafe for the environment.

The geological formation means the 
fracking will also have to be more intensive in the area, which is 
dangerous because of the various tectonic plates beneath California, 
environmentalists say.

While there is currently no legislation against fracking in California, the State Department of Conservation released a draft of fracking rules, starting the process to set regulations.

But not every large company is getting involved with the process; Chevron has drilled into the area but has 'not been encouraged by the results', it told NBC in a statement.

Others aren't giving up just yet.

'I don't really know what the break point
 is for the companies,' Tupper Hull, from the petroleum association, 
added. 'That's what our members are trying to figure out right now.'
