Luckless Lewis Hamilton's bid for a fifth pole position in Hungary literally went up in flames as his car caught fire early in qualifying.

Just minutes into the session at the Hungaroring, Hamilton's Mercedes was ablaze at the rear, and although he attempted to crawl back to the garage, it proved a futile exercise.

Hamilton was forced to stop on the pit lane entry road where marshals quickly used extinguishers to douse the fire, started by what Mercedes claimed to be a fuel leak.

That's Rosberg's third straight pole, and barring a mechanical problem, he looks set to extend his lead over Hamilton as we head into the summer break.

Thank you for your company today, and be sure to join us for tomorrow's Hungarian Grand Prix.

Hungarian GP Grid: 1 Rosberg; 2 Vettel; 3 Bottas; 4 Ricciardo; 5 Alonso; 6 Massa; 7 Button; 8 Vergne; 9 Hulkenberg; 10 Magnussen

The German goes faster on his final run and he is almost half-a-second quicker than Sebastian Vettel who will be on the front row for tomorrow's race.

Button goes fourth fastest, and he has time to turn in another lap. It's Bottas up next and the Williams man misses out on pole by just over one tenth. He is second.

But Rosberg goes fastest with a 1:23.236 and he is almost two tenths quicker than Vettel. Has he done enough to secure pole? Surely, the circuit will be improving but is the rain coming in again?

But what a time that is from Vettel who lays down a marker with a time of 1:23.415 and he is the best part of eight tenths faster than Bottas.

Bottas is the man of the moment and he sets the fastest time. His first run is two seconds quicker than Rosberg. Does the German have one eye on the championship? Ricciardo is second fastest, three tenths adrift of the Williams with Alonso up next.

We're back underway in Hungary and it appears as though the track is at its worst in Turn 1 and Turn 2. The track could get quite a bit quicker in the next few minutes. Rosberg is the first man on track and he is followed by Ricciardo.

The session will re-start in two minutes. The brolleys are still up, but it appears as though the rain has eased off.

Nico Rosberg locks his brakes at Turn 1 and runs wide, and BANG, Magnussen is in the barriers after locking his brakes, too and he heads straight into the barriers. A heavy shunt for the McLaren man, but he is OK and out of his car. The session is suspended as the marshalls repair the tyre barrier.

The drivers are on slick tyres, but they probably know they have one shot at posting their best time with the rain intensifying.

It's raining in the paddock ahead of the top-10 shootout. That will add a bit of spice to the remainder of the session. The cars are stacked at the end of the pit lane awaiting the green light.

Rosberg laid down the marker with a 123.3 with the two Red Bulls close behind him. It looks as though it is the German's pole to throw away today, mind.

'So, we couldn't even beat Sutil,' is the message from a frustrated Grosjean over the team radio. He will start 15th tomorrow.

Kvyat had set two personal bests but lost the rear of his Toro Rosso under braking at Turn 12, and he is out of his car.

On track, and with three minutes remaining, Hulkenberg, Perez, Gutierrez, Grosjean and Biacnhi are heading out of qualifying. It's Rosberg, in the troubled-free Mercedes, who tops the timesheets.

LEWIS HAMILTON: 'I bailed out of that timed lap and something happened to my brakes so I had to engage some settings to correct it and then the engine just died. I was on the pit lane entry so hoped I could get it back to the pits and they could fix it but I looked in my rear mirrors and it was on fire.

'I hoped to get it to the garage and maybe they could do something but I tried to stop and the brakes weren’t working. It is all pretty bad. I honestly don’t know what I can do tomorrow. I will struggle to get in the top 10 at least the top 5 I will probably leave here more than 20 points behind Nico but here are still races to go. I will try my best.'

Niki Lauda: 'It is not back yet so we have to get it back and see what it is. The fuel pressure went down and there was a fire so the logic is the fuel caused the fire. I hope the car isn't too much damaged. It is completely unfair. Two races in a row. Here passing is difficult. He would have been fastest today. He would have won the race no question.'

We're green for Q2 - a 15-minute session to reduce the 16 remaining drivers to 10. Will we get any more drama? Meanwhile, Mercedes have confirmed that a fuel leak caused the fire on Hamilton's car.

Unbelievable. For the second consecutive race Kimi Raikkonen has been knocked out of qualifying in Q1. The Finn was sitting in Ferrari garage as Jules Bianchi, on the books of the Italian team of course, usurped his time. Madness.

Stunning pictures of Hamilton's Mercedes on fire. That will now be six races without pole for the Briton and it's damage limitation once more for the 29-year-old...

Back on track, and Hamilton's nemesis Nico Rosberg is top of the timesheets some two tenths ahead of Daniel Ricciardo.

Jules Bianchi, Max Chilton, Romain Grosjean and Marcus Ericsson occupy the relegation places with Maldonado and of course Hamilton both out of qualifying.

Hamilton can't believe it. He watches the marshals put out the fire and puts his head in his hands. His Mercedes is wrecked with smoke still billowing out of the engine.

Unbelievable. Hamilton's Mercedes is up in flames. The Briton is touring round the track, and he makes it back to the pit-lane but he has to jump out of his car. The marshals are quickly on the scene and extinguish the fire, but that means Hamilton will start at the very back for tomorrow's race. You couldn't make it up. What rotten luck for the Briton.

Pastor Maldonado pulls off the track in his Lotus with yet another mechanical error for the troubled team. It looked as though the Venezuelan, who has already signed on with Lotus for next season, completely lost drive. How many more mechanical failures can that team have?

The light goes green in Hungary and a gaggle of cars head on to the track. The midfield runners head out on the harder tyre.

The FIA are now reporting a 30 per cent chance of rain during qualifying. We get underway in a little over five minutes...

Christian Horner has been speaking following his blast at the Formula One media in Friday's press conference.

'I stand by everything I said yesterday. We shouldn’t be talking the sport down the whole time. The drivers have got to be the heroes and thereafter the cars should be second to that. We need to give more access to the drivers and the fans have got to be able to engage with the drivers.'

Toto Wolff is sporting an arm brace in the paddock this weekend after fracturing his wrist in a cycling crash earlier this week.

Wolff was taking part in a team building exercise with his Mercedes colleagues, but it turned in to somewhat of a farce after Wolff’s injuries, Paddy Lowe suffering bruising and race engineer Jock Clear cracking three ribs.

Stick to four wheels, chaps.

The circuit is currently bathed in summer sunshine, but to the south of the track it certainly looks as though there are some dark clouds gathering. We've got 30 minutes until the start of today's qualifying session...

Niki Lauda has apologised in person to all at Ferrari following his derogatory remarks made in the wake of Sunday's German Grand Prix.

debut on the 2016 Formula One calendar. A move for Baku, the capital city, to host the race was first revealed by Sportsmail in March.

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner launched an astonishing tirade against the Formula One media on Friday.

My aim heading to Germany was firstly to extend my lead in the championship over Lewis Hamilton, and then win what is my second home race after Monaco, so it was very special to win for myself and for Mercedes as it is one of the most important grands prix on the calendar for the team.

Lewis Hamilton was quickest in both sessions in Friday's practice sessions for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix on a demanding track where he has won four times; his team-mate Nico Rosberg was second.

Lewis Hamilton has endured somewhat of a qualifying nightmare of late. Indeed, it’s been five races since the Briton stuck his Mercedes on pole.

But where better to end his current one-lap hoodoo then Hungary? The 29-year-old is a specialist in Hungary, winning in his debut year in 2007, then again in 2009 in a dog of a McLaren, in 2012, and claiming his first victory in a Mercedes last term.

Hamilton was fastest once more this morning, meaning he has topped the timesheets in every practice session so far at the Hungaroring ahead of team-mate and his rival for the title Nico Rosberg.

Rosberg is 14 points ahead of Hamilton heading into tomorrow’s race after victory at the German Grand Prix last time out.

Hamilton will be desperate to close the gap ahead of the four-week summer break.
