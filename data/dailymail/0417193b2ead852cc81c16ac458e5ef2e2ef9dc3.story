Queenslanders have shown their true spirit by refusing to cower after one of Australia’s worst cyclones in years thrashed its coastline.

Cyclone Marcia hit the Sunshine State, ripping up trees, flooding houses and leaving thousands without power but one bold resident has displayed the sentiment of thousands with a simple sign that reads: ‘Marcia you b***h we’re still here.’

The note, written in yellow paint, was reportedly spotted on the side of a road near a BP servo in Marmor, a small town in central Queensland that became one of the worst places hit by the cyclone.

Residents of the township on the Bruce Highway, about 45 kilometres south of Rockhampton, have had their homes destroyed and power cut by the natural disaster.

Local resident Col Stepanoff told the ABC that the town is pulling together: ‘Everywhere is a tight-knit community in time of disaster.

‘You might not talk to them, just wave every now and again - but in time of disaster they come and ask if you're all right - that's standard everywhere.

‘People get in and help each other out.’

When the cyclone hit on Friday the state's residents flocked to social media to share their front-row views of the category five storm.

Images and footage posted to social media sites show roads, backyards, and public places completely flooded with rain water, as the torrential downpour continued to lash the coast.

But not everyone stayed indoors, with defiant surfers hitting the beach despite the howling winds.

A surfer who braved the raging conditions spoke to Studio Ten about his unusual morning surf. 'It's just massive out there, no form, like soup or a washing machine,' he said.

'I just love it, I live for it, it's the best time to go out.' 

The surfer said that he had been worried he would hit the rocks, and had smashed his board, but was determined to head out again as soon as the waves cleaned up.

'I'm hoping it gets bigger and the best it can get,' he said. Images of people venturing out in the torrential weather have garnered criticism from social media users.

'Dear idiots, stay out of the cyclone. We may not miss you but the people who do the rescue are valuable,' posted one Twitter user.
