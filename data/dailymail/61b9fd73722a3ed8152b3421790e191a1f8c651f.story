The woman who disappeared from her San Francisco hospital room only to be found dead two weeks later in a fire-escape stairwell in the same building had been seen by a hospital employee a week before she was found.

A worker at San Francisco General Hospital reported seeing an unconscious woman in a fire-escape stairwell one week before the body of the missing patient, Lynne Spalding, 57, was found in the same spot.

Spalding disappeared from her room on the hospital's fifth floor on September 21, two days after she was admitted for treatment of an infection.

Tragic: Lynne Spalding, 57, had been missing for two weeks from her hospital room in San Francisco. A week before she was found dead a worker alerted police about an unconscious woman in the stairwell

Her body was found October 8 on the fourth-floor landing of the locked stairwell.

According
to sources, a hospital orderly told a nurse on October 1 that he had 
seen a woman, apparently passed out, on the fourth floor of the 
stairwell.

The orderly 
said he had stepped over the prone woman twice, once going downstairs 
and again when he returned to the fifth-floor door that he had used to 
enter the stairwell, according to the SFGate.

The nurse contacted the Sheriff's Department, but it is unclear why no one arrived at the scene to investigate.

Police have not been able to determine how the department responded on October 1, the sources said.

They said it is possible no one responded to the stairwell, or that a deputy was dispatched to the wrong location.

It is also unclear whether the woman was still alive when the orderly found her.

There
was nothing in the nurse's call to the Sheriff's Department, however, 
that indicated the woman might have been dead, the sources said.

'What happened at our hospital is 
horrible,' San Francisco General Hospital Chief Medical Officer Todd May
said at a news conference.

'We
are here to take care of patients, to heal them, to keep them safe. 
This has shaken us to our core. Our staff is devastated.'

Hospital
spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said they did not know either how long the 
mother-of-two had been left lying there, nor how she had come to be on 
the fire escape in the first place.

She added: 'It's very concerning. We're distressed and don't know what happened. It's our top 
priority to find out.'

The 
cause of her death is now being investigated by the San Francisco 
Sheriff's Department and police. A police investigation was launched 
after the 57-year-old British woman first went missing.

The
disorientated mother-of-two had been admitted to the hospital for 
complications to an infection and was being monitored by staff every 15 
minutes, but disappeared between check-ups.

She
is believed to have walked out of her room on her own accord, and was 
found with her pocketbook but left her cell phone in her room.

Discovery: Ms Spalding's body was still on the premises and was found by a hospital employee in a stairwell

At the time of her disappearance, family spokesman David Perry told ABC that Ms Spalding was on medication, which could have caused her to become disorientated.Â 

Mr Perry said: 'We find it disturbing 
that someone can go missing from the hospital. One would think there 
would be cameras or something.'

Ms Spalding, who was originally from the UK but lived in San Francisco, worked in tourism in the West Coast city.

She was divorced with two children, a 23-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son.
