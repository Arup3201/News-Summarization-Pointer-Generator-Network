President Barack Obama today recognised the sacrifice of a courageous U.S. Marine by giving him the nation's highest military award, the Medal of Honor.

In a solemn ceremony in the White House's East Room, Mr Obama told the family and friends of Sgt Dakota Meyer how, in a conflict that has produced thousands of American heroes, the 23-year-old's extraordinary tale of courage stands out from the rest.

Meyer charged through heavy insurgent gunfire on five death-defying trips in an armoured Humvee to save 13 Marines and Army soldiers and another 23 Afghan troops pinned down by withering enemy fire.

He personally killed at least eight insurgents despite taking a shrapnel wound to one arm as he manned the gun turret of the Humvee and provided covering fire for the soldiers, according to the military.

Dakota Meyer 'placed himself in the thick of the fight... again, again, and again,' President Obama said, recalling the events of September 8, 2009, when Meyer defended his fellow soldiers in far-off Kunar Province, Afghanistan during an ambush attack.

'You did your duty, above and beyond,' President Obama said. 'Because of your honor, 36 men are alive today.'

Meyer, now a civilian,  also accepted the Medal in Honor of four comrades who did not survive the attack.

The White House said Meyer is the third living recipient of the military decoration for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. He is the first Marine so honoured with the medal.

His hero's moment, however, was his 
darkest day. Meyer lost some of his best friends the morning of the ambush.

'It's
hard, it's... you know... getting recognised for the worst day of your 
life, so it's... it's a really tough thing,' Meyer said prior to the ceremony, struggling for 
words.

Meyer's slain comrades will be memorialised in hometown ceremonies at his request.

The ceremony comes after an informal meeting between Meyer and President Obama on Wednesday, when the two men were pictured having a beer on a patio outside the Oval Office.

White House spokesman Jay Carney tweeted: 'Over the weekend, 
the President's staff called Meyer in preparation for Thursday's Medal 
of Honor ceremony at the White House. Meyer asked the staffer if he 
could have a beer with the President. POTUS invited Dakota to come by 
the White House this afternoon.'

The Medal of Honor, awarded by the U.S. government, is bestowed by the President on members of the U.S. Armed Forces who distinguish themselves through 'conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States.'

According to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society:

In
Afghanistan, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol 
moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley on the day of the ambush.

Meyer
and the other Americans had gone to the area to train Afghan military 
members when, suddenly, the village lights went out and gunfire erupted.
About 50 Taliban insurgents on mountainsides and in the village had 
ambushed the patrol.

As the forward team took fire and called for
air support that wasn't coming, Meyer, a corporal at the time, begged 
his command to let him head into the incoming fire to help.

Four 
times he was denied his request before Meyer and another Marine, Staff 
Sgt Juan Rodriguez-Chavez, jumped into the Humvee and headed into the 
fray. For his valor, Rodriguez-Chavez, a 34-year-old who hailed 
originally from Acuna, Mexico, would be awarded the Navy Cross.

'They
told him he couldn't go in,' said Dwight Meyer, Dakota Meyer's 
81-year-old grandfather, a former Marine who served in the 1950s. 'He 
told them, "The hell I'm not," and he went in. It's a one-in-a-million 
thing' that he survived.

With Meyer manning the Humvee's gun 
turret, the two drew heavy fire. But they began evacuating wounded 
Marines and American and Afghan soldiers to a safe point. Meyer made 
five trips into the kill zone, each time searching for the forward 
patrol with his Marine friends - including 1st Lt Michael Johnson - 
whom Meyer had heard yelling on the radio for air support.

With 
Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez ready to test fate a fifth time in the kill 
zone, a UH-60 helicopter arrived at last to provide overhead support. 
Troops aboard the chopper told Meyer they had spotted what appeared to 
be four bodies. Meyer knew those were his friends and he had to bring 
them out.

'It might sound crazy, but it was just, you don't 
really think about it, you don't comprehend it, you don't really 
comprehend what you did until looking back on it,' Meyer said.

Wounded and tired, Meyer left the relative safety of the Humvee and ran out on foot.

'He just really took a chance,' Dwight Meyer said.

Ducking
around buildings to avoid heavy gunfire, he reached the bodies of 
Johnson, a 25-year-old from Virginia Beach; Staff Sgt Aaron Kenefick, 
30, of Roswell, Georgia; Corpsman James Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California; 
and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr, a 31-year-old gunnery sergeant from 
Columbus, Georgia.

Meyer and two other soldiers dodged bullets and 
rocket-propelled grenades to pull the bodies out of a ditch where the 
men had died while trying to take cover.

The deaths of Meyer's 
comrades prompted an investigation into events that day, and two Army 
officers were later reprimanded for being 'inadequate and ineffective' 
and for 'contributing directly to the loss of life.' Along with Meyer's 
friends, a fifth American - Army Sgt Kenneth W Westbrook, 41, of 
Shiprock, New Mexico - was fatally wounded in the ambush.

Respected: Meyer, 23, signs a book for one of his high school teachers before giving remarks to his high school faculty and staff at Green County High School in Greensburg, Kentucky on August 3

Remembrance: Meyer, 23, shows the black wristbands he wears on each arm honouring the three Marines and Navy corpsman who were killed in action in Ganjgal, Afghanistan, during the ambush

Meyer said 
he'll be humbled by the memory of his fallen comrades as he receives the
award on Thursday. One of the memorials will be at a Columbus cemetery for
gunnery sergeant Johnson, a father of three who served nearly 13 years 
in the U.S. Marine Corps.

Will Duke, one of the organisers, said the memorials spoke volumes about Meyer.

'I
can tell by his actions, not only the actions he took in earning the 
Medal of Honor in Afghanistan but also the actions he is taking now. 
Essentially by requesting these memorial services for his fallen 
comrades, he's saying this is about them,' Duke said.
