A congressional candidate in the U.S. has taken an unusual approach to sharing his views - posting a political rant about the Tea Party and the anti-abortion movement... from his toilet.

Democrat Erick Wright posted the feature, which he named Politics On The Throne, before he decided to run for congress.

The self-confessed entrepreneur tried to remove the video from YouTube after launching his bid to become congressman for the 2nd congressional district in Alabama, Yellow Hammer News reported.

Alabama Democrat Erick Wright broadcast his political ramblings from the toilet, in a video he called Politics On The Throne

Wright, who is set to challenge the incumbent Republican Martha Roby in Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, has removed the post from his YouTube channel since taking the decision to run for government

During his toilet-based rant, he tells his audience that abortion is a person's 'God-given right'

His rest room ramblings included the statement that abortion is a 'God-given right', as well as criticisms of Fox News and the Tea Party.

Wright said state and local government place far greater restrictions on people's lives than the federal government.

Lecturing from his loo, Wright tells the camera: 'The way you wear your pants — people are getting fined $100, $200 and even getting jail time just by the way they wear their pants.

'What’s next, are you going to tell a gay person they can’t be gay? 

'Or are you going to tell a person who dresses in drag that that’s not appropriate and you’re going to fine them too?

'Like, when will enough be enough?

'If you want to have an abortion, what kind of intrusive things do you have to go through just to get an abortion knowing that it’s your God-given right to do so as an American?'

On his website, the prospective congressman, tells voters: 'I set out to help restore faith in the public process and elevate the dialogue between Congress and the beautiful people Congress represents.

'You are those people, and I believe I am succeeding by reaching out to you.'

Wright, who describes himself as an activist, neighbour, friend and businessman, is set to challenge the incumbent Republican Martha Roby, for the chance to represent Alabama's 2nd congressional district.

His YouTube channel features a series of political ramblings from the last couple of years, including posts addressing spending, another entitled the 'Signs of Slavery' and another that is titled the 'South Will Rise Again'.
