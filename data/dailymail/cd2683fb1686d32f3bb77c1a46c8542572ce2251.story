A Texas elementary school teacher has been charged with sexually assaulting a six-year-old kindergarten student.

The Austin school district has fired 33-year-old Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan.

Andrade-Gaytan taught a bilingual kindergarten class at a central Austin elementary school.

Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan: He has been arrested and charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child after a 6-year-old girl told her parents that Andrade-Gaytan had assaulted her

Unexpected: Andrade-Gaytan, a third-grade bilingual teacher, had been teaching a summer school program at Reilly Elementary.

According to an arrest affidavit, Andrade-Gaytan kept a six-year-old girl in the classroom while the remainder of the class went to recess and asked her if she’d like to play a game..

She was a student in Andrade-Gaytan’s summer Kindergarten class at Reilly Elementary.

Police tried to question Andrade-Gaytan on Thursday, but he denied being alone with the girl.

The girl told a parent she had been assaulted. Investigators say she was taken to a hospital, and DNA evidence has been found on her clothing.

On Friday, Andrade-Gaytan allegedly called AISD police to confess, saying he wanted to talk about 'making a mistake.'

There is no evidence that other students had been or will be in any danger.

Communication: A letter was sent home to parents explaining the situation. School officials said that nothing came up on Andrade-Gaytan¿s criminal background checks when he was hired and subsequent checks were clean

Andrade-Gaytan was removed from the classroom immediately following the allegations.

Investigators don’t believe that Andrade-Gaytan knew the student, and he only had her in class one day.

People who commit sex crimes on children tend to choose targets they are more familiar with, said Eric Mendez, the district’s police chief.

'This is very disturbing. This is not typical behavior,' Mendez said. 'Usually in these types of incidents the suspect knows their victim or their intended victim for some time.'

As of late Saturday, Andrade-Gaytan remained in the Travis County Jail on $50,000 bail. It was unclear whether he had hired an attorney.

Police Chief Eric Mendez: The teacher came in yesterday and during an interview provided information and confirmed that he did indeed sexually assault the child

Andrade-Gaytan had taught in the school district since 2009 and earned $43,000 a year.

He has been a teacher with AISD since Aug. 2005. He has taught at McBee, Linder and Walnut Creek elementary schools.

School officials said that nothing came up on Andrade-Gaytan’s criminal background checks when he was hired and subsequent checks were clean.

Kalina Orwick has four kids that attend Walnut Creek Elementary school. She said the fact that this was a kindergartner is very disturbing.

'They don't even know how to spell, they barely know their ABCs and they have to worry about parents and teachers that are crazy,' said Ms Orwick to Fox News.

History: Andrade-Gaytan has worked at several AISD campuses including Linder, McBee, Reed, and most recently teaching 3rd graders at Walnut Creek Elementary

Orwick said it's scary as a parent to know you can't trust your child's teachers.

'I think they deserve to be protected just like how we protect them at home, it needs happen at school,' said Ms Orwick.

'You can very well put cameras or something in the classroom so we can see what they're actually doing. That's the problem. The teachers are free to say and do whatever they want,' she said.

Several of Andrade-Gaytan’s neighbors stood in the main street of their subdivision Saturday discussing his arrest for sexual assault, which they’d learned of minutes earlier from a post on the neighborhood association’s Facebook page.

'I’m in shock,' said Michael Collins, to the Austin American-Statesman. 'I don’t even know what to say.'

Andrade-Gaytan had lived in the house for about two years with his wife and their two children, a 6-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter, the neighbors said.
