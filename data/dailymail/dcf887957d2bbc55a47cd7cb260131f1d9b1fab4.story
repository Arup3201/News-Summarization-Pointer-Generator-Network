The son of a senior British diplomat was arrested under anti-terror laws after he innocently signed for a parcel while his neighbours were out, it was revealed today.

James Sutcliffe, 19, whose father Nicholas is a first secretary to the Foreign Office, was later released without charge after Scotland Yard officers reportedly ‘messed up’ after a mysterious tip-off.

His arrest over the weekend led to dozens of officers, some wearing biohazard suits and using breathing equipment, spending days 'tearing up' his parents' home and garden in South London.

'Torn apart': The home of senior British diplomat Nicholas Sutcliffe was raided by anti-terror police after his son James, 19, signed for a mysterious package

Mistake? The family of Mr Sutcliffe, a first secretary to the Foreign Office, claim police may have 'messed up' after a tip-off which led to the garden being dug up

The teenager was bailed but has now been told he faces no further action.

Police feared the package, which has never been found, may have contained a poison called Abrin, which could have been ordered online and sent from America.

Officers said after 'following intelligence' they realised it had been sent to James' neighbours, who it later emerged also knew nothing about it. They were never arrested.

After days of police activity at the Sutcliffe's £650,000 home ended yesterday, a friend said they 'just want to be left alone to get on with their lives'.

'The family understand that the police have to do their job and check out information they have been given', the woman told the Evening Standard.

'The family knew they had done nothing wrong but had to wait for the police to carry out a thorough search. They want to put this behind them and are in no way angry with the police or authorities.'

Anger: The diplomat's sister-in-law Jenny described James's arrest as 'lunacy' and a 'mix-up'

Well equipped: Many of the police officers were wearing biohazard suits and using breathing equipment

Sources close to the police investigation suggested that the 19-year-old had been evasive about what happened to the package.

A friend of the teenager said yesterday: 'My understanding is it's all a bit of a mess–up'.

The teenager lives with his father Nicholas, 56, and his mother Carole, 54.

The couple have three other grown-up sons, two of whom are at university and one of whom lives in Japan.

Mr
 Sutcliffe, is described in the Diplomatic Service List as a ‘First 
Secretary’. He was posted to Brazil in the early 1990s and was then 
based in Havana, Cuba, before returning to Whitehall in 2001.

Mr
 Sutcliffe's sister-in-law Jenny described James's arrest as ‘lunacy’ 
and suggested the entire operation was a ‘mix-up’. His brother Peter, 
49, said it was ‘extraordinary’
