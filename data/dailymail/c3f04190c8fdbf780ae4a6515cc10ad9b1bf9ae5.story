When Catherine Howarth was handed her newborn baby, she had something of a surprise.

Because while she is black with Nigerian heritage, her infant son was completely white.

And even though her husband Richard, 34, a medical recruitment consultant, is white, she believed they’d been given the wrong child.

Mrs Howarth, a 32-year-old financial analyst from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, said: ‘When Jonah was handed to me I immediately fell in love with him'

In fact, three-month old Jonah is the startling result of a one-in-a-million combination of his parents’ genes.

And now his looks are expected to take the baby modelling world by storm after his stunning blue eyes and creamy complexion saw him signed up by five of the country’s leading agencies. He has already appeared in several photoshoots.

Jonah is the startling result of a one-in-a-million combination of his parents’ genes

Last night Mrs Howarth, a 32-year-old financial analyst from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, said: ‘When Jonah was handed to me I immediately fell in love with him.

‘I did note he was pale but thought that was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck when he was born. But a few hours later he was still really white with blue eyes. I even wondered if we’d been handed the right baby.’

‘I did note he was pale but thought that was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck when he was born. But a few hours later he was still really white with blue eyes,' said Mrs Howarth

Doctors confirmed that Jonah is not an albino, and his mother added: ‘Everyone on my side of the family going back generations have all been black. But doctors say that I must carry a recessive gene for white skin colouring.’

Top agent Charlotte Evans, who owns the Elisabeth Smith agency, said: ‘Jonah has a lovely shaped face and a beautiful complexion. He’s also very photogenic.’
