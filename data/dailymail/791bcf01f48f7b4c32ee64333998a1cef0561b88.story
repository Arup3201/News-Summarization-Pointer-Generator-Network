A Florida woman is free to eat pasta in her car once again after serving a month in jail because cops confused a crusty spoon in her possession with SpaghettiO's residue as being the drug methamphetamine.

Ashley Gabrielle Huff, 23, was arrested on July 2 by the Gainesville police department after they suspected her of having meth residue on a spoon in her car that she hard pressed was SpaghettiO's residue.

She was released from Hall County Jail on Thursday after a crime lab analysis confirmed that the spoon had sauce residue instead of drugs, reports The Gainesville Times.

Falsely accused: SpaghettiO's lover Ashley Huff, 23, served one month in jail after police confused a spoon with pasta sauce residue as being the drug methamphetamine 

Spgahetti-Oh no: Ashley Huff repeatedly told police the spoon had SpaghettiO's residue but they didn't believe her and she even considered taking a plea deal even though she committed no crime 

'I think she said it had been SpaghettiOs,' Hall County assistant public defender Chris van Rossem said.

'From what I understand, she was a passenger in a car and had a spoon on her, near her, and I guess the officer, for whatever reason, thought there was some residue,' he added.

Huff had no criminal record prior to her July arrest.

'She’s maintained all along that there’s no way in hell that’s any sort of drug residue or anything like that, ‘van Rossem added.

Huff originally tried going through the Hall County Drug Court but was unable to make all of her court dates.

She was incarcerated again on August 2 but couldn't afford to pay bond. She considered taking a plea deal even though she committed no crime.

'I think what the unfortunate part about her case is that she was probably willing to take the felony to close out her case so that she get out of jail, even though she always maintained innocence,' van Rossem said.

'The Crime Lab report showed no controlled substances on the spoon submitted for testing,' according to a dismissal signed by Northeastern Judicial Circuit District Attorney Lee Darragh.

Innocent: The only sauce Ashley Huff, who has no criminal record, likes to consume is drug free and paired with delicious round shaped pasta
