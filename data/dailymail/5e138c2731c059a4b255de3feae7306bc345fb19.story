A Miami Beach police officer claims he tested positive for drugs during a random test because of his use of sexual aid cream.

Reinaldo Casas was fired from the Miami Beach Police Department on February 27 after testing positive for drug use.

The test had been administered by Dr Ben Droblas at the Health Centre of Miami on January 15, according to an internal affairs file.

Casas has already had a rocky career with the police force and was reprimanded in the past for making ‘conflicting statements’, missing court appearances, ‘excessive sick time usage’, and ‘gross negligence’, according to Miami New Times.

But the former cop is refusing to admit to taking drugs and has filed a grievance complaint to state his case.

In the report, filed on March 13, Casas claims the test came out positive due to a sexual aid cream/gel he had taken as per his girlfriend’s advice, after his sexual prowess had been lacking.

‘I was baffled, perplexed, and confused as to how these [results] could be possible,’ Casas says in the report.

He said that he had come to his conclusion that the cream was to blame after ‘heavy deliberation and the insight of others’.

‘The sexual aid cream was provided to me by a friend to assist my sexual performance,’ he stated in the report.

It is unclear what lotion Casas might have been applying that would have contaminated the results of his drug test.

Casas claims he was involved in a rollover crash in 2002 which had ruined 30 per cent of his memory, according to the Times.

When cops looked into his claim that he'd lost 30 per cent of his memory in July 2005, they came up with nothing.

They also found he had lied about whether any allegation against him had ever been sustained while he was employed at the Hialeah Police Department.

His conduct had been ‘highly inappropriate’, a police investigator found, and Casas was suspended for two days.

In 2006, he was cited for ‘gross negligence’ and ‘gross inefficiency’ in a case involving a rental van, which he allowed a tow truck to take away, even though it had more than $1,000 worth of goods inside.

Casas, who was making over $122,000 a year, according to Miami Beach Exposed, claimed ‘there was no property in the van’ when it was towed.

One year later, Casas missed a court appearance saying it was because of a dental appointment, but Miami Beach Police had no record of that purported telephone call, according to internal police records.

It was his second unexcused absence in a year, according to the Times.

Miami Beach Police spokesperson Bobby Hernandez said Casas' grievance report is awaiting arbitration.
