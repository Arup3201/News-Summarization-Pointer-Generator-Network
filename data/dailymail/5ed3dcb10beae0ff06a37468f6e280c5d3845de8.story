Maria Spruce ran up a bill of £3,500 on the credit card for Wolverhampton City Council. She claimed she was in financial difficulty but was found out while holidaying in Australia

A disgraced council worker who used the authority's credit card to run up a bill of £3,500 when she got into financial difficulties was found out while she holidayed in Australia. 

Maria Spruce, 40, was supposed to use the Wolverhampton council credit card to pay for work-related goods but instead used it for her own means, buying items for her family including several mobile phones. 

However, despite claiming she turned to the card because she claimed she had run into financial problems, Spruce still managed to fund a holiday to Australia and her fraud was uncovered while she enjoyed herself Down Under. 

The electoral registration assistant now faces prison after she admitted, at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court, one charge of fraud by position. 

Spruce spent £3,517 on the card. 

Roger Bleazard, prosecuting, told the court that Spruce had run into financial difficulties and turned to the card to buy personal items.

She spent the cash on herself and her family between September 1, 2013 and January 21 this year, buying several mobile phones. 

Spruce had worked at the authority for five-and-a-half years and was immediately suspended after the fraud was uncovered.

Speaking after the hearing Councillor Paul Sweet, Wolverhampton City Council cabinet member for governance and performance, said the council had launched its own internal disciplinary investigation.

He added: 'The fraud that Maria Spruce admitted in court was uncovered by the council while she was away on holiday last November.

'She was immediately suspended from her role as an electoral registration assistant and the matter was reported to the police.

'Following her guilty plea before the magistrates, a full disciplinary hearing is now scheduled to take place.

Spruce was supposed to use the authority credit card for work-related items at Wolverhampton City Council

Spruce apparently used the company card because she was in financial difficulty, but holidayed in Australia

'City of Wolverhampton Council has a zero tolerance policy towards fraud and will always take action.' 

Spruce, from Bilston, in the West Midlands, was granted unconditional bail and will be sentenced on March 20 at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

He guilty plea comes just weeks after Anthony McHale, 56, set up and managed six false housing benefit payment accounts for fictitious people at the same authority. He swindled the council out of £32,000 and was branded a 'dishonest crook' by a judge last month. 

McHale was handed a 20-month prison sentence suspended for two years with 300 hours unpaid work.
