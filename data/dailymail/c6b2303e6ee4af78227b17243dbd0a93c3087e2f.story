Generous: Madison Holleran's former teacher Edward Modica (pictured) has started a petition urging universities to implement proactive anti-suicide strategies

A former teacher of a popular University of Pennsylvania track star who committed suicide in January has started an online petition urging universities to become more proactive before and after such tragedies.

Edward Modica, 64, was Madison Holleran's fifth-grade teacher at Brookside School in Allendale, New Jersey. 

He said there has been a 'void' in his heart since the 19-year-old jumped to her death from a parking garage on Spruce Street, Philadelphia on January 17 because she couldn't deal with the pressures of college life.

The New Jersey teen left a suicide note and gifts for her family before she plunged to her death.

The tragic loss prompted Modica to post the 'Passage of The Madison Holleran Law' petition on MoveOn.org.

He wants New Jersey colleges to accurately list the numbers of suicides and attempted suicides on their campuses annually and new laws requiring that they provide certified suicide prevention personnel counselors to help potential victims.

'It seems, unfortunately, that suicides have become a regular occurrence on campuses,' the retired teacher told the Daily News.

'This would allow parents to know what's going on and the parents could delve into those issues before school begins.'

More than 3,380 people have signed the petition.

Loss: Madison Holleran, a track and field star at UPenn, jumped to her death on January 17. Her father James, (right) said she had taken her life because she was overwhelmed by the workload at her new school

Final moments: The 19-year-old freshman posted this image of Rittenhouse Square to Instagram an hour before her death

The freshman's shocking death rocked the UPenn community and sent shock waves through her hometown of Allendale, New Jersey.

Her
 father, James Holleran, told the New York Post that she killed herself because she was 
overwhelmed with schoolwork at UPenn - changing her from the happy 
student she had been throughout high school.

Although he and his wife Stacy had encouraged their daughter to stay home or transfer at Christmas, the determined teen insisted on going back to school.

'There
 was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn,' Mr Holleran tearfully told 
the Post. 'She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and 
stress.'

Mr Holleran said that she had told her parents in December that she was feeling suicidal and was seeing a therapist.

'We
 knew she needed help,' he said. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost
 confidence in academics and she also lost confidence in her track 
abilities.'

On the day that 
she jumped to her death, her father texted her encouraging 
her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she 
would.

But just hours later,
 she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family
 on top of the parking garage before she jumped. Her family would not 
detail the contents of the note.

Just an hour before she jumped to her death, the young woman posted an image of a sunset over Rittenhouse Square to her Instagram 
account.

Mr Holleran said that he did not blame the school for his daughter's suicide but that he wanted to warn other parents.

Holleran
 was a member of UPenn's varsity track and field team.
 Her teammates were given the option of whether or not they wished to 
compete in the upcoming meet.

'The
 entire Penn community is deeply saddened by the death of Madison 
Holleran,' Penn president Amy Gutmann said in the statement.

Family friend Bob Weckworth said the high-achiever ultimately couldn't cope with the expectations she'd set herself.

'People talked to her within hours of her act of suicide and there were no red flags, warning signs, nothing,' he told the Daily News.

'This kid didnâ€™t have a boyfriend. There were no drug issues. There were no mental health issues in her background. It was just the last two, three weeks where they saw a change in her. Something snapped.

'She got a 3.5 her first semester, and I think just the high expectations that she put on herself was that thatâ€™s just not acceptable.'

Days after Holleran's death, more than 600 devastated relatives and friends paid their respects at a funeral service at the Guardian Angel Church in Allendale, New Jersey.

During the mass, Mr Holleran said that his daughter used to rally her team by saying: 'Now is a time to be strong.'

He added: 'Today, we all have to be strong for Madison.'

He then urged the congregation to learn from the loss of an 'iconic' young woman: 'Please seek therapy if you need it. This is not a weakness, but a struggle.'

He also led them in the Serenity Prayer, saying: 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.'
