Aston Villa newboy Carles Gil has hinted he wants to make an impact like hero David Silva after similarly swapping Valenica for England.

Silva starred at the Mestalla having graduated from youth ranks until a £24million move to Machester City in 2010.

Gil, an attacking midfielder, rose through Valencia’s academy too and has been signed by Paul Lambert for £3.25m in the hope he can aid Villa’s dreadful scoring record. Lambert’s side have just 11 goals in the Premier League all season.

'David Silva is a player I admire most,’ said Gil. 'I can play on both sides and also in the middle. I’m hoping to be able to support the team and play as well as I can. Over last few years been playing several positions. I’ll adapt to whatever position the manager wants me to play.

’The Premier League is the best in the world, very different from the Spanish league and very difficult. I’m very happy to be able to participate in league and play. I think I’ll adapt quickly.

'I know Aston Villa have a lot of fans and it’s important that I give them what they want.’

Gil revealed he had sought advice from Carlos Sanchez, a former team-mate at Elche, about the move. 'I’ve been speaking to him about the city and what Birmingham’s like. I'm looking forward.’

Lambert added: 'He gives us something we’ve been crying out for, that creative spark needed that to finish off the work, unlock doors, make things happen.

'I’m not putting massive expectancy levels on him, he’s 22 and just here But he's played in La Liga versus great players, great teams. I’m excited by him.'
