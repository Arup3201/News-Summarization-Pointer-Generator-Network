The Pope entered Scotland’s independence debate yesterday, saying he would be worried by a vote to split up the UK.

Pope Francis said the break-up of countries such as the former Yugoslavia that had been forced together was justified because its people were so diverse.

But asked about breakaway regions such as Scotland and Catalonia in states where people had long been united, he said the case for independence was ‘not so clear’.

Pope Francis and the US President Barack Obama has both spoken out against Scottish independence, in a blow for Alex Salmond

In remarks that may resonate with 
Scotland’s Catholics, he said: ‘All division  worries me. There will be 
cases that are just, but the secession of a nation without a history of 
enforced unity must be taken very carefully and analysed case by case.’

He is the latest high-profile figure to question Scottish independence ahead of the referendum in less than three months.

Barack
 Obama dealt a blow to the nationalist cause last week by urging 
Scotland not to leave the UK, while Hillary Clinton, who is tipped to 
replace him as US president in 2016, told BBC’s Newsnight on Thursday: 
‘I would hate to have you lose Scotland.’

Harry Potter author JK Rowling donated £1million to the Better Together campaign against independence this week.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told BBC Newsnight that she hoped Scotland would not leave the UK. She said a 'Yes' to independence vote would be a 'loss for both sides'

Pope
 Francis told La Vanguardia newspaper in Spain, where the debate about 
Catalonian independence has been boosted by events in Scotland: ‘There 
is independence through emancipation and through secession. Independence
 through emancipation includes the Americans, who emancipated themselves
 from the European states.

‘Independence
 of people through secession is a dismembering. Obviously, there are 
peoples with cultures so diverse that they cannot be connected. The 
Yugolsav case is very clear, but I wonder if it’s so clear in other 
cases, with other peoples who have been united up until now.’

Scottish
 National Party MSP Dave Thompson said: ‘We welcome the call by Pope 
Francis for voters to analyse the case for independence. Most people 
will conclude that independence is the surest route to a more socially 
just Scotland.’
