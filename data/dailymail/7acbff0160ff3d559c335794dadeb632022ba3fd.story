Police say Gary Dudek used his position in medical sales to steal $350,000 worth of skin grafts

A medical salesman is accused of using his position as a sales representative to steal more than $350,000 
worth of human skin from a Philadelphia hospital over nearly three 
years.

Gary Dudek, 54, of Wallingford, has been charged with theft and tampering with records.

Dudek worked as a sales representative for Organogenesis, a Massachusetts-based regenerative medicine company, and was in charge of managing the company's accounts for Mercy Hospital's bio-science department as well as supplying the facility with skin grafts.

Between November 2011 and July 2013, Dudek used that position to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of skin, authorities said.

In his job, Dudek had an 'open purchase order' allowing him to order skin grafts whenever he wanted.

But police claim he made several unauthorized purchases and the hospital never received the grafts.

He was allegedly captured twice on surveillance video taking the grafts from the hospital to his car.

It's possible he made the unauthorized purchases to pocket the sales commission.Â 

Dudek declined to comment, asking reporters to contact his attorney, Eugene Tinari, for a statement.

'If Mercy Hospital has suffered 
losses and they can be deemed to be as a result of Mr. Dudek's actions 
then perhaps a civil suit could have been initiated,' Tinari said. 'But to take this 
into the criminal arena against a man who has been nothing but 
hard-working and law-abiding his entire life is a bit draconian, in my 
view.'

Mercy Hospital officials declined comment.
