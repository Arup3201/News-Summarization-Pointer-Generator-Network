Shoppers are unwittingly buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt, sugar and fat, an expert has warned

A leading consumer activist has named and shamed the supermarkets guilty of confusing shoppers with unclear labelling. 

Martin Isark says shoppers are unwittingly buying own brand supermarket foods high in salt, sugar and fat because the information is being hidden from them. 

As a result, they may be compromising their health without even realising.

He told MailOnline: 'It's easier said than done when it comes
to making an informed choice on the content of salt, saturated fat and sugar in pre-packed food on our supermarket shelves. At worst, 
nutritional values are not there at all!

'Others appear not to be there, 
but they're hiding under the outer label that you have to peel off to 
find them, or you require a magnifying glass to read them.'

A common trick is displaying salt as 
sodium, which is a lower figure and therefore appears to be healthier.

Mr Isark, who runs the website and consumer barcode scanning app CanIEatIt (www.canieatit.co.uk), added: 'Just 
remember that 1g of Sodium is equal to 2.5g of salt, that sugar can be 
labelled as 'carbohydrate' and saturated fat just as fat. 

'Obesity, heart disease and type 2
diabetes are all on the increase – supermarkets should 
remember that when they are leaving off the sugar, saturated fat and 
salt values.

'At Can I Eat 
It we help the shoppers by adding nutritional values of a similar 
product to our App when the product’s packet or the website or does not.'

Here, from worst to best, he names and shames the worst offenders when it comes to food labelling and then praises those that are the clearest...

WAITROSE

Waitrose is the worst when it comes to clear nutrition labelling. The labels are easy to read, but they insist on ‘sodium,’ so you have to multiply it by 2.5 to get the salt level. Why?

Are they frightened that shoppers and surfers won’t buy their products if they know the salt level?

I have not found a shopper yet who knows that you have multiply the sodium level by 2.5 to get the salt value. Not helpful if you are watching your salt intake. 

Waitrose does not have any excuses for being bottom of the pile – they control their website and their labelling.

A spokesperson for Waitrose said: 'We are committed to clear and open nutritional labelling. We are legally obliged to give a measure for sodium - but we also give a salt value on the vast majority of products.'

LIDL

Lidl’s pre-packed products that have been packaged in the UK, are as good as any on the shelves. These labels display easy to read nutritional values per 100g or 100ml.

But the products that are produced in Europe have impossible-to-read multi-language labels and some have no nutritional values at all, such as the Ocean Sea, Norwegian Smoked Salmon, which has a very high salt content.

Yes, Lidl has 5,000 plus stores throughout Europe, but so do Aldi – and they manage to produce clear, easy to read nutritional labels on their products sold in their UK stores.

Lidl was criticised for a lack of labelling on high-salt products such as smoked salmon, while M&S lists the salt in butter as a percentage, which can be misleading

OCADO

Most products have nutritional information on their website, but like Waitrose they choose not to display the salt - does profit come before their shopper’s health?

However, www.ocado.com has more and better nutritional information than www.waitrose.com

TESCO

Most items are well-labelled but occasionally, nutritional values are given per slice, per biscuit or per portion - when the norm is to provide nutritional information per 100g or 100ml as well. Adding nutritional information per 100g to all their products would help. 

MARKS AND SPENCER

I'd say 99 per cent of Marks & Spencer’s nutritional labelling is excellent. However, when space is limited they do use double labelling - where one label is under the other.

This is a growing habit by producers to use double or piled up labels on their products to cut down the space needed for all the information required these days.

Marmite is a high profile example, where you need peel back one label to reveal the nutritional values underneath. This is rather time-consuming when you're browsing in a shop. 

SAINSBURY'S

Again, 99 per cent of the nutritional labelling is excellent, but occasionally, we have found that some products have the nutritional values listed by their percentage. For example, a pack of Sainsbury's Farmhouse butter is labelled as having 2 per cent salt.

It may seem just a pinch, but that 2 per cent translates into two grams per 100g, which shoots it straight into the high 'red' traffic light zone.

However Sainsbury’s are on the right track, and their website has more products displaying nutritional values per 100g or 100ml than Tesco.

Mr Isark praised The Co-operative for listing the ingredients even in their alcoholic drinks

MORRISONS

All Morrisons own-branded products we checked had easy-to-read labels and displayed salt, sugar and saturated fat. Adding the ingredients and nutritional values for their alcoholic drinks would be a real plus!

ALDI

Aldi has clean and easy-to-read nutritional labelling that leaves you in no doubt how much salt, saturated fat or sugar is in the product.

The store has shown that you can be no-frills supermarket and package products with easy to digest nutritional values that enable their shoppers to make a more informed choice so that they and their family can eat more healthily.

ASDA

Asda’s nutritional labelling is excellent on their products and their website. Only the occasional baking or cake decoration product lacks nutritional values, but this is the norm for these products. 

If Asda could extend their nutritional and ingredient information to cover their alcoholic drinks – they would be challenging for the top spot.

THE WINNER:

THE CO-OPERATIVE

This store has clean and easy-to-read nutritional labelling that leaves you in no doubt how much salt, saturated fat or sugar that’s in the product.

Supermarkets and big brand producers should not wait for health ministers and institutes to wave the big-stick for them to change. 

The Co-operative has even started listing the ingredients in their alcoholic drinks, even though it's not a requirement at the moment. All supermarkets should follow their lead.

He has rated The Co-operative as the best for clear, honest labelling

But Lidl and Ocado also get poor scores for missing information
