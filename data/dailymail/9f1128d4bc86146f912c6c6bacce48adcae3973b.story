Special guest: White Dee, Deidre Kelly, surprised Nick Clegg on his radio show today and invited him to 'Benefits Street', assuring him it was not full of 'scroungers'

A star of the controversial Channel 4 show Benefits Street surprised Nick Clegg on his weekly radio show today and told him she and her friends are not 'scroungers'.

‘White Dee’ – the self-proclaimed ‘mother of the street’ in Birmingham - told the Deputy Prime Minister the show's producers had hoodwinked them by saying it would be a 'documentary about community spirit'.

The 42-year-old also invited the Liberal Democrat leader to visit for a cup of tea and said he would see a 'clean street', not the rubbish-strewn images shown on television.

But she admitted she voted Labour because she was 'annoyed' his party had gone into coalition with the Tories.

The five-part series has been a massive ratings success for Channel 4 but its stars have said they were betrayed and made to look like 'scumbags'.

Mr Clegg admitted he had been too busy to watch it.

During her surprise appearance on Call Clegg, Dee told him: 'I think it’s very cleverly edited. We had no idea it would be this big.

'They told us it was going to be a documentary about community spirit, and even though some of us are on benefits, how we get along and help eachother'.

Yesterday Channel 4 was accused of exploiting children as young as seven by showing children on Benefits Street swearing and misbehaving.

Critics
 said it was 'utterly reprehensible' that 'distressing' scenes were 
being shown where youngsters clashed with their parents.

Dee was seen yelling at her tearaway seven-year-old son Gerrard 
after he lost his bicycle before she shouted at him 'you're grounded'.

Surprise: Nick Clegg could not hide his surprise when Dee introduced herself to him, and said that producers had hoodwinked residents

Today she told Mr Clegg James Turner Street would welcome him.

'We would love him to come to the street,' she said. 'He would see a very clean street. He would see people getting together, helping each other - not scrounging - and children at school.

'He would be very, very welcome. I am very into politics. I vote every year. I discuss with people whether they vote because I do say, if you don't vote, why are you moaning about the situation?

'The last time I voted it was Labour because I was really annoyed when 
you went into coalition with the Tories, but you can win me back, Mr 
Clegg. You can attempt to win me back.'

Challenge: Residents of James Turner Street had a challenge ahead of them to compete in the Britain in Bloom competition

Nick Clegg said there was a big debate about the welfare state going on around the country.

'We need to be quite hard-headed about that,' he said. 'But I think we have to avoid demonising whole groups of people . I think that makes it more difficult to take the difficult, tough decisions about how we continue to reform welfare'.

Benefits Street has brought Channel 4 its highest ratings for more than a year.

The programme has courted controversy
 from the start, with the inhabitants of James Turner Street in 
Birmingham saying that the producers 'did anything they could' to get 
the most shocking footage.

Child star: Gerrard Kelly, the seven-year-old son of 'White Dee' who appears on Benefits Street on Channel 4 but questions have been raised about whether the broadcaster got proper consent before showing the youngsters on screen

Claimant culture: On James Turner Street in Birmingham it is claimed that over 90 per cent of the residents are on benefits

Although
 the people who appear on the programme were not paid for their 
appearance - which could affect their ability to claim benefits - they 
claim producers used gifts instead to assure their co-operation.

The third episode in the series on Monday pulled in 5.2million people - the biggest audience since the 
Paralympic closing ceremony.

However, the programme has attracted hundreds of complaints to Ofcom from viewers.

The television watchdog will wait until the end of the series before deciding whether to launch a full investigation.
