As men around the world celebrate Father's Day, New York photographer Harold Feinstein has released a moving gallery of tender shots of dads with their children.

The heartmelting images capture fathers from all walks of life spending time with their sons and daughters - strolling on the beach, fishing off a pier, swimming in the ocean - over the last six decades.

Feinstein, 83, shared the black and white snaps to honor his 'two extraordinary children' - chess champion Gjon, and dog lover Robin who died in 2001 of breast cancer - as well as his alcoholic Russian-born father who he described as 'a passionate man with a gusto for life that I inherited.'

'Over the years I have loved photographing fathers with their children. I hope they portray the tenderness and kindness all children deserve from their fathers,' he reflected in a blog called 'On Fathers and Fatherhood'. 'I humbly hope I have been such a father and as I have aged, I have come to appreciate the kinder, gentler side of my own father.'

Harold Feinstein's portrait gallery can be viewed online at haroldfeinstein.com.
