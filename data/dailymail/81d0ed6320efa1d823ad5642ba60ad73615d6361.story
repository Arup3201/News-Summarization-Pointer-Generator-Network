Two loving parents of a transgender man have placed a birth notice in their local newspaper to celebrate the 'arrival' of their son Kai, who was born Elizabeth.   

Yolanda Bogert and Guy Kershaw put the notice in the December 2 edition of The Courier Mail to correct their 'mistake' and place a 'retraction'.

The 19-year-old, from Brisbane, born Elizabeth Anne now identifies as a man and goes by the name of Kai Bogert.

This 'birth' announcement appeared in Tuesday's edition of Queensland paper, The Courier Mail

Brisbane's Kai Bogert is 19 years old and was born Elizabeth Anne Bogert in 1995

'In 1995 we announced the arrival of our sprogget, Elizabeth Anne, as a daughter,' the loving message read.

'He informs us that we were mistaken. Oops! Our bad. We would now like to present, our wonderful son – Kai Bogert. Loving you is the easiest thing in the world.'

But the proud parents could not resist poking fun at the teenager and added: 'Tidy your room.' 

Placing the ad in the paper seemed like a 'no brainer' for Ms Bogert.

'I needed to show my son I support him 100 per cent and wanted to let the world know that,' she told The Courier Mail.

'It is all very new to us. Kai just told me a few days ago that he no longer wanted to live as a girl.'

Ms Bogert said there was always 'something different' about Kai who at first showed little signs but then later on it became more evident.

Shocked about his mum's openness, Kai said he was happy with what she had done.

A tweet of the notice has gone viral on Twitter, attracting almost 2,000 retweets in just eight hours

'In 1995 we announced the arrival of our sprogget, Elizabeth Anne, as a daughter,' the loving message read

Mr Bogert is yet to undergo a gender re-assignment procedure

'This last week has changed everything for me. I am still me but I am more me than I was a few days ago and feel free,' Kai told The Courier Mail.

Within eight hours of Twitter user Lisa Dart sharing a photo of the notice, it had been retweeted almost 2,000 times and favourited almost 1,800 times.

It attracted messages of support, including one from Ms Dart who wrote: 'Best Birth Announcement ever. Today's CM. What a wonderful family.'

The announcement also warmed the heart of Aunty Miche who said: 'Parentin, ur doin it rite (sic).'

While Goldie Pwn wrote: 'I wanna be this cool a Mom when I grow up.'

A gushing King K said: 'how cute is that!!!!' 

Kai is yet to undergo a gender re-assignment procedure and has not yet had any hormones.
