Federal authorities are investigating whether school board candidates in a small, dirt-poor town in Texas used cheap beer, drugs and cigarettes to buy votes.

The federal investigation into voter tampering in the tiny border-town of Donna - near the southern tip of Texas' border with Mexico - was revealed in late December, just days before the president of the town's school board is suspected of committing suicide.

So far, three people in Donna - which is so poor that several houses are without electricity and even running water - have been arrested by federal authorities in connection to the alleged voter tampering.

One of the women indicted, 48-year-old Diana Balderas Castaneda, admitted to authorities that she bribed roughly 10 people to vote for Democratic school board candidates during the 2012 election.  

But authorities suspect these types of bribes began much earlier than the general election - Castaneda also told authorities that a school board candidate gave her $125 to give food and cash to primary voters in exchange for their vote.

According to charging documents obtained by ABCNews.com, she sometimes gave voters up to $20 per vote. 

And in several cases, Castaneda told authorities, she paid voters in cigarettes or beer, or took voters to buy drugs after a campaign manager paid them for votes.

An unidentified witness told the FBI that in the days leading up to the 2012 election, Castaneda gave her a card with the names of candidates on it.

On the cards, she told federal investigators, 'the opposing candidates' names were crossed out.'

'After voting, Castaneda told Witness 2 she would meet him/her at the 
shed by Witness 2's friend's house that same day to pay Witness 2,' federal 
prosecutors allege in court documents. 'She paid Witness 2 $10 for 
voting for her candidates.'

Two others arrested as a result of the investigation are Guadalupe Escamilla, 72, and Rebecca Gonzalez, 44, each of whom was arrested in December and formally indicted last week.

Not long after the feds made their arrests, Donna school board President Alfredo Lugo was found dead in his home of an apparent hanging.It's unclear whether the women who were arrested worked for Lugo, and he was not specifically named in any of the charging documents against the women - nor were any other members of the school board involved with the vote-buying case.

Donna is an extremely poor section of Texas, with many residents living in dilapidated shanty-type homes. 

'People are desperate and hungry,' a legal source close to the case told ABC. 'It does not excuse illegality, but people do weird things because of poverty.'

Lugo was described by the source as a 'hero to the community' who may have lost his way.

Each of the women charged face up to five years in prison if convicted.
