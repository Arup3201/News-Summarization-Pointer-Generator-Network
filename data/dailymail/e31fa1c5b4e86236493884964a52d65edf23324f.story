Most penguins take to the water quite naturally - and with great elegance.

But three-month-old Chudi was terrified of taking the plunge, even as his family joyfully dove into the pool at a Russian zoo.

The zookeepers in Krasnoyarsk were so worried about the baby penguin they isolated him from the rest of the birds. 

Now, a heart-warming video has emerged of Chudi being taught how to stay afloat for the first time.

Two zookeepers had to be designated as Chudi's personal swimming instructors.

They coached him as many fathers would their young children - by throwing him into the deep end.

His technique needs a lot of improvement but Chudi conquered his fears and he even seemed to enjoy himself in the water.

He opted to splash happily in the pool before eventually tiring and making his way back to dry land.

The penguin chick was hatched in an incubator at Royev Ruchey Zoo in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.

Chudi is from the only penguin species that lives in Africa and is therefore more suited to hot, southern hemisphere weather.

For that reason, he and his relatives spend the winter in a specially heated room.

His birth was seen as somewhat of a sensation as he was the first endangered African penguin to be born inside a Russian zoo.

Special habitat: Because Chudi (pictured at birth) and his relatives are used to warm weather, they spend winters in a specially heated room

A zoo spokesman said: 'At first he couldn't do anything for himself, not even lift his head and his eyes were shut. 

'We had to keep him in a special heated chamber so he could build up his strength and growth while feeding him on minced fish.'

African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are monogamous birds that mate for life

In the summer, Chudi's parents Marfa and Lenya started building a nest in the outdoor enclosure and laying a single egg  in an incubator.
