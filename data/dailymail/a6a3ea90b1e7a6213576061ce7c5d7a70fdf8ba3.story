Iain Duncan Smith says that the latest figures show that welfare reforms are working 

The number of workless households has fallen by its sharpest rate since records began.

There are now 3.3million homes in which no one has a job, a drop of more than 270,000 in a year and the biggest fall since 1996.

However, it still means that one in six British households are unemployed. The fall in benefits-dependent families was heralded as a sign that the Government’s welfare reforms – designed to make it less lucrative to live off the State rather than find a job – were working.

While overall 16 per cent of households have no adults working, this rises to 21 per cent in the North East. In the South East, the figure is just 12 per cent.

According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of children living in workless households also fell by 132,000 from a year earlier, to 1.5million. This equates to one in eight children, compared to one in five almost 20 years ago.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘There is no better example of welfare reform in action than giving children the economic security of living in a household where people are bringing home a regular pay packet.

‘My priority has always been to get people back to work who had been left behind – people for whom work was not part of their life.

‘These record figures show that not only are we successfully helping people to escape worklessness and turn their lives around, but we are also giving hope to the next generation.’ 

Workless households are defined as homes where no one aged 16 or over is employed, either because they cannot or will not find a job, or because they are unable to work due to family or studying commitments, retirement, sickness or disability.

The data showed that single parent households with dependent children were most likely to have no one in work. 

The level of workless households has fallen to 16 per cent, the lowest level since records began in 1996

Married men, or men living with a partner, were the most likely to be employed.

Andrew Hunter, co-founder of jobseekers’ website Adzuna, said: ‘The jobs market has come on leaps and bounds. However, the headline numbers gloss over some subtleties of the recovery.

‘Lone parents with dependent children are still the least likely to be employed – more could still certainly be done to help single parents break back into the workforce.’ 

He also pointed out the regional variations, saying: ‘The recovery is uneven throughout the country, with the proportion of workless households in the North East remaining high.

‘Areas like Sunderland are still in the first throes of recovery. There are still 11 jobseekers searching for every available role in the city.

‘Compare this to cities like Cambridge, where vacancies outnumber jobseekers, and job-hunting in the North East looks somewhat bleak.’ 

Earlier this month, ONS data showed the biggest fall in UK unemployment for 40 years.

It fell by 538,000 in the past year, the largest drop since records began in 1972, while employment rose to record levels of 30.7million.
