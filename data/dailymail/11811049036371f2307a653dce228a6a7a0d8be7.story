The comfort of reclining chairs, bean bags, pillows and couches that sometimes enhance the cinematic experience have been one-upped in Russia, where an entire movie theatre has been filled with beds.

While sites such as the Electric Cinema in London's Notting Hill have a front row devoted to beds, one screening room in the Kinostar De Lux Playhouse was gutted of all of its seats with 17 double beds brought in.

The project has been dubbed 'Wake Up Love' in line with a campaign by Swedish furniture chain Ikea, which provided the beds.

The film lovers' experience at a multiplex a shopping centre in Khimki, north of Moscow, doesn't just include the bed on which to watch a latest release, but on entry they're given slippers.

Each row features different products from Ikea, including side tables and reading lamps, along with matching curtains, for customers to use.

Swedish furniture company Ikea provided 17 double beds along with other furniture for customers

Patrons get slippers on entry before kicking back on the beds with popcorn and soft drink for the films 

Once in the cinema, patrons are encouraged to flick off their slippers and relax.

Those who attend the next screening can be reassured by the promise that sheets are changed by staff after each film. 

The promotion began last week and is scheduled to end later this week.
