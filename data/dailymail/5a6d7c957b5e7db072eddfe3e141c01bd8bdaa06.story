The Tories have opened up a clear lead over Labour when voters are forced to choose between the two parties, a new poll shows.

Some 41 per cent of voters would prefer a Conservative government led by David Cameron, while only 36 per cent favour Ed Miliband leading a Labour administration.

With 101 days until the election, pollsters say ‘many voters have lost faith in Labour’ but they have not yet been convinced by the Tories, with 42 per cent believing they are still the 'nasty party'.

The Tories have opened up a five-point lead over Labour when voters are forced to choose between the two parties, but the gap is driven by falling enthusiasm for Ed Miliband taking power

A Ford Capri - seen by voters as the car version of Nigel Farage

Nigel Farage is seen by voters as a Ford Capri – carrying a ‘shiny exterior’ to cover a dodgy engine under the bonnet, new polling has revealed.

When asked to say which car the main party leaders would be voters named the retro car or a ‘four-by-four with illegal bull bars on the front’.

David Cameron, meanwhile, is seen as ‘something smooth’ like a Mercedes or a Range Rover, according to focus groups quizzed by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was seen as a Smart car – or a people carrier, carrying round everybody else’s baggage.

Ed Miliband was more difficult to pin down. One voter said he was a Ford Focus – because he was ‘average’, but changed their mind because the ‘a Ford Focus is reliable’.

Mr Cameron used a speech in Southampton today to set out the ‘moral and practical’ case for cutting taxes.

He hopes to contrast Conservative policies on tax, welfare and growth with Labour’s lack of trust on the economy.

But the Prime Minister has yet to persuade voters that he has their best interest at heart.

Detailed polling shows more than two-thirds of voters think Mr Cameron ‘doesn’t understand the lives of people like me’, that the Conservative party cares ‘more about the rich and affluent than ordinary people’ and that the Tory party ‘contains many people with bigoted and intolerant views’.

Almost half - 46 per cent say – Mr Cameron has ‘no clear principles’, and 42 per cent think the Conservatives are still the ‘nasty party’.

However, 48 per cent say the Tories will take ‘tough but necessary’ decisions.

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron's personal net satisfaction rating has improved markedly in recent weeks, up to 7 per cent, while Mr Miliband's has tumbled to minus 50. 

The five-point lead on the ‘forced question’ of who voters would prefer in power is the highest in a YouGov/Prospect survey for two years.

At the same time, Labour is three points ahead when voters are asked who they intend to vote for, with the views of those planning to support smaller parties likely to decide the outcome of the election.

On the forced question, Ukip supporters back the Tories over Labour by 50 per cent to 18.

You’Gov’s Peter Kelner said: ‘Doubtless, the Tories feel frustrated that so many of their past supporters have moved to Ukip.

‘However, our figures suggest that the Tories may be able to win many of them back in the key marginals by stressing their message, “vote Farage, get Miliband”.’

Support for a Tory government with Mr Cameron at the helm has remained steady at 40 or 41 per cent for the last two years.

The increase in the Tory lead is a result of falling enthusiasm for a Labour government.

‘Miliband’s reputation and Labour’s support have declined, but Cameron’s and the Conservatives’ figures have not improved,’ Mr Kellner writes in Prospect magazine.

‘In short, many voters have lost faith in Labour but not transferred their affections to the Tories.’

There was renewed speculation at the weekend that the SNP could prop up a minority Labour administration.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon suggested it would be better for the whole of Britain if Nationalists were sitting in a Miliband Cabinet.

Mr Cameron said the remarks were further evidence of the need for a Tory government.

Speaking in Southampton, he said: 'If there was anyone who thought the worst possible outcome of the election was an Ed Miliband-led Labour government, actually I can now tell you something that would be even worse, and that is Ed Miliband in Downing Street, supported by the Scottish National Party who want to break up our United Kingdom.

‘The battle of this election has become even more important.'

However, Mr Kellner said cautioned that this approach will not be enough to secure an overall majority for the Conservatives.

‘Frightening Ukip supporters with the nightmare of a Miliband government could help the Tories remain ahead of Labour – but won’t be enough to reach the 326 seats needed for an overall majority in the new House of Commons.’
