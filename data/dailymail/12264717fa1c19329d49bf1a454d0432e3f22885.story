Frostie is a cheeky, happy, little goat, who loves attention.

And the baby goat is certainly getting a lot of it, as he learns to walk with the help of a customised wheelchair.

Frostie, who is just over one-week old, was brought to Edgar's Mission, a not-for profit sanctuary for rescued farm animals outside of Melbourne, on Tuesday.Â

Before: Frostie as a one-week-old, getting used to his makeshift wheelchair, unable to use his hind legs as a result of an infection contracted through the umbilical cord

The wheelchair was once used by Leon Trotsky (right) whose mother sat on him crushing his legs as a baby. The little pig is now one-month-old and is mostly recovered

He was covered in lice, severely dehydrated and had lost the use of his back legs, due to an infection he contracted through his umbilical cord.

Pam Ahern, founder and director of Edgar's Mission, said that after a few days at the sanctuary being treated with antibiotics and painkillers, the little goat had improved so much that he began getting frustrated and trying to run around and play.

Frostie was fitted with a wheelchair, which allows him to run around using his forelegs until he recovers the use of his legs, which should happen as the infection leaves his system.

The wheelchair was originally made for a baby pig named Leon Trotsky, now one month old, who was injured when his mother sat on him, crushing his hind legs.

The little pig, whom Ms Ahern says has 'so much spunk', has recovered enough that he was able to donate his wheelchair to his friend, Frostie, though Ms Ahern says that Leon is definitely 'too fast for Frostie to keep up with him.'

Frostie was brought to Edgar's Mission, which was founded by Pam Ahern in 2003, as a place for rescued farm animals to be cared for

Leon and Frostie are close friends, though Ms Ahern says that the 'spunky' pig is too fast and the injured goat has trouble keeping up with him

The little goat is one of 350 animals currently cared for on the sanctuary, which as well as pigs and goats is home to cows, alpacas, deer, sheep, chicken, geese, duck, rabbits, guinea pigs, peacocks, and horses.

Edgar's Mission was started by Pam Ahearn after she rescued her first pig, Edgar Alan, in 2003 and realised that injured farm animals did not have the same help as native animals or pets.

'I was involved in fostering cats and dogs and rehabilitating native animals, and a lot of organisations do that and a lot of individuals do that, but they forget about farm animals,' she said.

'Just because they look different to cats and dogs, they're still animals.'

Sometimes the animals are brought to the sanctuary by members of the public, as was the case when locals found an injured two-day-old goat on Tuesday that they suspected had fallen off the back of a truck.

Pam Ahearn says that the little goat, who is just over a week old, thinks of her as its mother and will cry out if she leaves his sight

Thomasina, as she was named, now lives at the sanctuary is Frosty's favourite playmate.

In other cases, the animals are rescued from imminent death, such as Monty, the miniature horse who was 'not miniature enough' and so was going to be sent to the knackery due to his size.

'Luckily someone intervened and he came to us.

'Every animal at the sanctuary has a story to tell. All of them have different stories of some kind act that got them to the sanctuary,' said Ms Ahearn.

'These stories are really lovely. It shows the goodness of the human heart, because people see an animal in pain and they want to help, they don't like to see another animal suffer.'

The little piglet is now one-month old and has recovered enough to get around without the wheelchair
