For many children, all it takes to have their dream playhouse are some boxes, a blanket or two and a boundless imagination.

But for those who want their dreams to become a reality it takes something extra – around £6,500. That was the sum paid for this Wendy house by an anonymous buyer. This Wendy house is a copy of one that was designed by Clive Hunter for his daughter Amanda-Jaye Hunter in 1988.

And while the mock-Tudor, one-bedroom property is enticing for those looking to downsize, the sales particulars warn: ‘The Wendy house is only suitable for small children as it has very restricted headroom, but it is possible for an adult to squeeze inside when crouched down.’

Sold: The miniature house bought for £6,500 by a secret buyer, and is essentially a very small working house, complete with the option for water and electricity

To a causal observer it might seem that the house simply appears smaller, but on closer inspection the house is really only fit of children

The 102 sq ft, two-storey house comes 
with twin beds, lights and a working sink which is ready to be hooked up
 to a water supply. For further comfort there are armchairs and a 
scaled-down grandfather clock.

Vendors
 Brian and Pamela McDonough, both 69, bought the cottage 11 years ago 
for their granddaughters but have sold it because they are grown up.

The
 McDonoughs, from Shrivenham in Oxfordshire, had the property 
re-thatched, repainted and re-glazed at a cost of £2,500 before putting 
the Wendy house on the market.

The
 playhouse was advertised as ‘fully furnished’ by Cotswold estate agents
 Perry Bishop and Chambers, who told yesterday how it had attracted 
interest around the world.

Sarah
 Benson, from the agents, added: ‘My own 26-year-old son even enquired 
about it. He wanted me to buy it and put it in the garden for him and 
his girlfriend to live in.’

The
 timber house sits on reinforced steel beams and will now be transported
 to the ‘wealthy’ individual’s home in the North East.

The house is deceptively small, and has all the rough mod-cons that one might expect from a small apartment, but is actually very cheap when compared to other posh Wendy houses on the market

While this playhouse might be the most recent posh Wendy house, it is by no means the most expensive.

In January 2011 a millionaire ordered the construction of a playhouse for his children that cost £150,000 - almost as much as the average house in England and Wales.

The two-storey timber playhouse has double glazing, solid pine flooring with underfloor heating, a TV and a stone chimney, and was eventually flown to Switzerland.

Ten craftsmen spent a total of 2,000 hours over five weeks building the play house, which has a 18ft by 15ft footprint, is 12ft tall and is made from 13,000ft of sandblasted pine wood planks.

The extravagant interior took a 
further ten days to fit and is so well insulated that the anonymous 
businessman's children will remain snug even in sub-zero Swiss 
temperatures.

Around 
£100,000 was spent on materials, construction and other costs, while up 
to £50,000 went on shipping the play house to Switzerland.

Another posh Wendy house, this one costing £55,000 and tailored to the specifications of the client who is ordering it

The two-storey playhouses contain a kitchen (left), lighting and finishings that you might find in a rustic country home and while the houses could be comfortably lived in, they are designed as a playhouse nonetheless, and comes with features to entertain children like a slide (right)

The £55,000 Wendy house costed as much as a real three-bedroom home in Liverpool, but also had the ability to be landscaped

Another series of Wendy houses, built in October 2011 might actually suit most first-time buyers, and was sold for £55,000 in Liverpool.

The 12ft by 10ft Wendy house was constructed by The Master Wishmakers, who constructed a few of the houses based on orders from clients and featured two floors, a kitchen, underfloor heating an a reception room.

The company claimed that for what clients were getting they were the most expensive play houses readily available on the market.

The clients were mostly intended to be investment bankers and footballers, who would buy the houses for their children, and were intended to be useful even after the children had grown up, with suggestions that they might be good as an office or wine cellar.
