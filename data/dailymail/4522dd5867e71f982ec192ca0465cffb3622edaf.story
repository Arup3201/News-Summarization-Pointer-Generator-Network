Fifa is investigating after photographs circulated of fans wearing black face makeup at Germany’s match against Ghana.

Photographs taken at the match showed two men, apparently Germany fans, with blackened faces in the Fortaleza stadium on Saturday.

Fifa said yesterday that its disciplinary committee is considering opening a case. It will also consider a report by the Fifa match commissioner, Eggert Magnusson of Iceland.

'We do not respect any discriminatory messages,' Fifa spokesperson Delia Fischer said.

‘We always take any evidence or submissions to our disciplinary committee. It is the disciplinary committee that will meet,’ a spokesman told The Guardian.

‘If they see any grounds they will open proceedings. Then it is up to the disciplinary commission to take the decision.’

FIFA holds national football federations responsible for their fans’ behaviour inside stadiums.

In a second incident, a man ran onto the pitch in the second half of the 2-2 draw.

The shirtless fan, who is reportedly from Poland had an email address and telephone number written on his back.

Ghana's former Portsmouth and Sunderland midfielder Sully Muntari, who currently plays for AC Milan, embraced the pitch invader before being detained by stewards and removed from the field.

Brazil’s organising committee spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi said the man was detained by local authorities.

Germany has a tradition of blacking up, often for theatrical purposes, that despite its burgeoning ethnic minority population and the fact that it is now unthinkable in the UK and the U.S., still continues to this day.

In January last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel courted controversy after she posed for pictures with carol singers who had applied black face paint to pose as the Three Kings.

It was part of the Sternsinger, or star singer, tradition of Dreikönigstag, the Three Kings' Day, when children go from house to house in groups of four and sing carols for charity.

It is tradition that one of the kings is black.

Err, is this okay in Germany? Angela Merkel peers at a carol singer blacked up to pose as one of the Three Kings at a post-Christmas event at the chancellery in Berlin in 2013

Prior to 
that, the Olivier award-winning playwright Bruce Norris in 2012 banned a
 Berlin theatre from staging one of his plays after learning that it 
intended to 'black up' a white actress for a lead role.

In
 an open letter he called on fellow playwrights to boycott any German 
theatre which still practices what he described as an 'asinine 
tradition'.

'Whatever
 rationale the German theatre establishment might offer for their 
brazenly discriminatory practice is of no interest to me,' he wrote.

'For,
 as little power as we playwrights have, we always retain one small 
power and that is the power to say no. To say, no thank you, I’d rather 
not have my work performed in Germany, today, under those conditions.'

Meanwhile, FIFA have also been contacted by the Fare network relating to discriminatory chanting at the World Cup.

Allegations
 of the use of improper language by supporters at games between Brazil 
and Mexico and Cameroon and Mexico have been passed on to FIFA by Fare -
 the organisation in place to tackle discrimination in football.

The
 allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates 
into 'whore' and has been heard in games in Fortaleza and Natal.

Concern: The allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates into 'whore'

FIFA said that while Fare had passed on concerns about both of the matches - played last Friday and on Monday - it was already engaged in disciplinary proceedings against Mexico.

It
 said in a statement: 'We can confirm that we have been contacted by 
Fare. Prior to this, disciplinary proceedings were opened against Mexico
 for improper conduct of spectators during the match Mexico - Cameroon.

FIFA also reiterated its position on discrimination of any kind.

FIFA recognises its responsibility to 
lead the way in abolishing all forms of discrimination in football. 
Article 3 of the FIFA Statutes states: 'Discrimination of any kind 
against a Country, private person or group of people on account of race,
 skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, 
religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any 
other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly 
prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.'

Worry: The use of improper language was also allegedly heard during Mexico's win against Cameroon
