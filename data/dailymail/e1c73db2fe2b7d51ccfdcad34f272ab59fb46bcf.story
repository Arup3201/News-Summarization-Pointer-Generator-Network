New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took on a persistent health care activist Tuesday during a regularly scheduled town hall event in South River, New Jersey, fending off accusations for nearly four minutes.

Maura Collinsgru, a health policy advocate with the liberal group New Jersey Citizen Action, blasted Christie during the question-and-answer event, the 114th such town hall he has held since taking office.

She blamed him for meeting her fellow activists with 'silence' when they try to help poor New Jerseyans access Medicaid benefits.

'Let me ask you this: When I expanded the Medicaid program, is that silence?' retorted an annoyed Christie.

Maura Collinsgru of New Jersey Citizen Action accused Gov. Chris Christie of failing to spend enough Medicaid dollars to provide health care to 900,000 New Jerseyans

Occupy Town Hall? Additional protesters jumped up to chant anti-Christie messages about Hurricane Sandy relief. They were later identified as activists with Working Families, a group supported by public-sector labor unions.

The New Jersey chief executive was among a small group of Republican governors who opted to take federal dollars provided by the Obamacare law to raise the maximum income that qualifies for free Medicaid insurance coverage.

The billions of dollars are helping lower-income New Jerseyans access health care now, but in future years the financial burden will shift to the states – a reality behind most Republican governors' decisions to turn down the money from Washington.

Christie has forged a middle path, taking the Medicaid dollars but refusing to spend still more state taxpayer money to expand Medicaid access even further, as many Democratic governors have done.

He told Collingsru on Tuesday that his state is spending more federal and state dollars on Medicaid that it was when he became governor.

'We've expanded Medicaid,' he countered. 'We're the second most generous Medicaid program in the United States of America.'

'You're simply wrong,' Christie blasted, in the tense exchange broadcast on CNN.

And he won't, he said, spend more on a 'failed federal program.'

Christie stayed silent as police removed his union-backed hecklers, including the woman at far left above.

Christie has held 114 Town Hall constituent meetings since becoming governor, earning a reputation for responsiveness despite occasionally being raked over the coals on subjects like Hurricane Sandy relief and the so-called 'Bridgegate' scandal

'You believe Obamacare works, and I do not,' Christie said, becoming more agitated by the minute but earning sustained applause from his audience. 'I'm sorry. That's just the way it goes.'

'We need to do other things,' the woman insisted, sounding more like a heckler than a questioner and insisting Medicaid is 'not a cure-all.'

She was likely referring to the New Jersey government's decision to opt out of creating its own Obamacare insurance exchange, forcing residents to use the federal government's problem-plagued healthcare.gov website instead.

Christie was also interrupted by more than a dozen union-backed activists from the Working Families organization. They sounded more like Occupy Wall Street devotees, shouting 'Mic check!' before chanting slogans in a call-and-response fashion.

'We are here to demand that you stop your corrupt uses of Hurricane Sandy money,' they yelled.

'There are still families without homes who have received no aid.'

Police ushered them out as the mostly appreciative crowd applauded.

Christie, who had kept mum while the protesteres yelled, said, 'Well, congratulations. You have now seen the latest gift given to you by the public sector unions in the state of New Jersey.'
