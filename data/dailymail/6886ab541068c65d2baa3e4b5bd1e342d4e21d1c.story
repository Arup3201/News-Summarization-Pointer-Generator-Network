His literary creations are some of the most well-known in fiction, but new research has suggested the characters of Charles Dickens may have had real-life counterparts.

The names of Bill Sikes and Scrooge may have derived from real people linked to the famous writer, according to new research.

The thug in Oliver Twist, the famous Christmas Carol miser and the ghost of his deceased partner have all been associated with people who worked or lived near Dickens's first London home.

According to the research, a trader named William Sykes lived in the same east Marylebone street as Dickens when the writer was a teenager.

Author Ruth Richardson has revealed the remarkable links in a new book, 'Dickens and the Workhouse', which investigates the writer's inspirations to coincide with the 200th anniversary of his birth, the Guardian reported today.

Richardson has also claimed that nearby Dickens's home was a sculptor mocked by many as a miser, while also close by was the premises of two tradesmen named Goodge and Marney.

The character of Scrooge, played here by Tommy Steele, was said to be based on a local sculptor who lived near Dickens who was mocked as a miser

These locals could be the inspiration for Scrooge and Marley, according to Richardson's book.

Both the miser and the tradesmen were said to live within yards of Dickens's lodgings in Norfolk Street.

Dickens scholars have until now ignored the real life inhabitants of Norfolk Street and any link they may have to the great writer.

But Richardson has described the links discovered between Dickens's creations and their real life counterparts as 'breathtaking'.

The business belonging to William Sykes was at 11 Cleveland Street, just a few doors away from where Dickens lived.

Richardson believes he was the inspiration for Bill Sikes, as she told the Guardian that 'he was certainly there while Dickens was planning Oliver Twist'.

Experts have described the research as 'most interesting and valuable'.

Michael Slater, the Dickens biographer for Yale University Press, said: 'Dickens was famous for making up amazing names – like Chuzzlewit – and names were very important to him.'
