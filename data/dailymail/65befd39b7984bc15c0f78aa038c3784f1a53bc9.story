The happiest dog owners in Britain have a pet Yorkshire Terrier, research has found.

The study of pet owners found a typical owner of the breed laughs ten times a day - more than any other - and describe themselves as the happiest people.

Music mogul Simon Cowell, 55, is one famous owner of Yorkshire Terriers, having adopted Squiddly and Diddly in October last year from a rescue centre to prepare for the arrival of his son Eric.

Socialite: Pug owners such as Paris Hilton, 33, who adopted a rescue dog named Mugsy four years ago, tend to be the richest - typically taking home an average salary of £85,000

In addition, pug owners such as socialite Paris Hilton, 33, who adopted a rescue dog named Mugsy four years ago, tend to be the richest - typically taking home an average salary of £85,000.

The study, by flea and tick preventative Frontline Spot On, looked at the personality traits of dog owners around the UK. It found Labrador owners, like Mario Balotelli, are most likely to be single.

The 24-year-old Liverpool FC footballer, who is devoted to his black Labrador Lucky and regularly posts pictures of the dog on social media, split last month from his fiancée Fanny Neguesha.

The study of 2,000 dog owners also found that the lowest paid dog owners tend to be Great Dane lovers, who take home a typical salary of £35,000.

And the most spoilt dogs are Dalmatians - with their owners spending £17 a week on toys and treats for them.

Christine Male, marketing manager for Frontline Spot On, said: ‘For many of the nation's dog owners, their dog is more than just a pet but a real part of the family too. It's interesting to note how our choice of dog can help define what sort of person we are.’

Despite their tiny size, Chihuahuas demand the most attention from their owners who spend a whopping 16 hours a day by the side of their pet - even in bed.

And dog lovers wanting a long and happy relationship should look no further than buying a pug, because 54 per cent of people with one are married.

In contrast, Britons with bulldogs are the most likely to be in a failing relationship. One in 12 who own one are looking to break up with their partner, the study found.

Jack Russell Terriers top the charts as the most mischievous dogs, with four in ten owners saying this was a characteristic of their pet.
