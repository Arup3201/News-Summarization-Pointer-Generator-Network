Most new year's resolutions involve going to the gym or spending more time with family, but part-time photographer Paul Amestoy set himself a more unique challenge in 2014 - taking one photo a day for 365 days.

In the amazing display of spectacular beach scenes, breathtaking sunsets and offbeat characters that Bondi has to offer, the Sydneysider's attempt to improve his craft was a success.

Through his photographs, which he shared on his Facebook page, the 38-year-old sales representative told Daily Mail Australia he wanted to capture what it was like to live at Bondi Beach, the place he had called home for eight years.

'It’s not just Sydney’s or Australia’s most famous beach, it has a very artistic flavour to it and a very creative hub,' Amestoy said.

'I just wanted to document that and try to make that connection with Bondi and contribute to it... and not just taking sunrises and sunsets, but the lifestyle as well.

'A lot of the photos that standout [in my collection] is when mother nature put on a show, but being in the place at the right time is part of that as well.'

Photography may only take up part of his time, but Amestoy took his 2014 challenge to heart.

'I took it extremely seriously, to the point where I would be driving home from a weekend wedding and it would be quarter to twelve at night and I would get out of the car and take a photo. so I had taken the shot for the day,' he said.

Slowing down the shutter speed on a camera creates the trail lights of cars. Amestoy used this technique to capture cars approaching Sydney Harbour Bridge

Photography may only take up part of his time, but Amestoy took his 2014 challenge to heart. Sometimes he would stop his car on the way home after a long day's work to make sure he took a photo

'It did get stressful at times when I didn't have time to get the camera out... but once I started I had to finish it.'

To help him capture the 'beauty of Bondi', Amestoy joined the Bondi Beach Sprint Club run by personal trainer Luke Walsh.

It was in this exercise group that he was got his inspiration for his shots of beach runners and joggers.

Amestoy said he wanted his pictures to have a point of difference and he achieved that by not following the traditional rules of photography.

'When you study photography, you don’t shoot into the sun but most of my shots shoot into the sun,' he said.

'I don't just take landscape or beach photographs, I try to make it different and don’t follow the rules and try to make it as creative as possible.'

Just because 2014 is over, Amestoy said it would not stop him from adding to his One A Day collection.

'As you can imagine I've taken a whole lot of photos to get my One A Day so I have plenty in my catalogue that I have not shared,' he said.

'So 2015 will be a collection of photos from the past and no doubt plenty of me still chasing sunrises, sunsets, storms et cetera.'
