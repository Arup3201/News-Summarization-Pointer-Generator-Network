Political heavyweights are to be ordered to measure their waistline in an attempt to get Parliament to set an example to the nation.

A letter backed by ministers is to be sent to every MP and peer urging them to check that their waist is less than half their height - a key indicator of having a healthy weight.

Former surgeon Lord McColl of Dulwich is now stalking the corridors of power to put pressure on Labour, Tory and Lib Dem members who accuses of ‘eating too much of the gross national product’.

Strain: It is claimed the green benches of the Commons and the red benches of the Lords are straining under the weight of gluttonous politicians

The government has warned that Britain has even fallen behind the US in failing to deal with the  obesity crisis.

Scientists say that by 2050, half of women, almost two-thirds of men and a quarter of children will be obese.

But earlier this week the National Obesity Forum said these predictions were ‘optimistic’ and underestimated the ‘true scale of the problem’.

Lord McColl, a former professor and director of surgery at Guy's Hospital, London, said that the rise in obesity is ‘the worst epidemic for 90 years and the cure is free’.

Lord McColl insists he ‘easily’ meets the target, and credits it to a former patient.

As
 a surgeon in his forties he was on his way to a black tie event, 
wearing a second-hand - and rather tired - dinner suit when he was called
 to hospital.

He was asked 
to see a patient with an inoperable tumour, who urged him to operate and
 promised to make him a new suit if it worked.

‘She
 survived another seven years and during that time she made me a black 
tie outfit so I have to stay in the same shape in tribute to her,' he revealed.

He now plans to write to all 650 MPs and 830 peers telling them to get a grip on their expanding waistline.

Lord McColl told MailOnline: ‘I will be sending the letter and asking them to measure their waist and height and if their waist is more than half  their height they have a problem.

‘I have been talking about this now for years, trying to get them interested.

‘Hopefully one day it will click. As I walk down the corridors of Parliament now they see me coming and tighten their jackets and say “I am trying”.

‘They are eating too much of the gross national product.’

Lord McColl said overweight politicians could not be seen lecturing the public on their eating habits.

‘I think the whole nation is at fault. We have got to get the whole nation moving on this.

‘It looks bad if politicians are telling the people what to do and they are not doing it themselves.’

The letter has been backed by health minister Earl Howe, who said he supported ‘any measure that encourages us all to improve our diet, to reduce physical inactivity and to be aware of what we need to do to keep our weight under control’.

MPs complain that they have piled on the pounds after being elected to the Commons.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who has been the butt of many jokes about his size, once boasted that his secret to trying to lose weight was  ‘no cheese, no chips, no seconds’.

It came after Nick Clegg said Mr Pickles was the ‘only Cabinet ¬minister who you can spot on Google Earth’.

Most senior politicians face pressure to keep their weight under control.

Mr
 Clegg claims to have lost a stone after taking up kick-boxing, after 
pictures of his paunch on holiday in Spain triggered headlines asking 
'who ate all the paella?'

David
 Cameron is often seen jogging in Westminster and at Prime Minister's 
Questions revealed his wife Samantha would strongly support him giving 
up a sweet treat for one day in a so-called 'war on sugar'.

Big beasts: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) has suggested his secret diet involves 'no chips, no cheese, no seconds' while Andrew Lansley, when Health Secretary, admitted that based on Body Mass Index he was borderline obese

Andrew Lansley, when Health Secretary, admitted that he was overweight and borderline obese.

Speaking
 in May 2012 he said that at 6ft 1in and just over 15st, he had a Body 
Mass Index of 28. A ‘healthy’ BMI score – used by doctors as a 
height/weight ratio – falls between 18.5 and 25.

But Lord McColl argues that the waist-height ratio is a better gauge of unhealthy fat around the stomach.

Some find the struggle to shed the pounds so great they have signed up to Parliament’s very own slimming club.

Members
 the Weight Watchers group include former Culture Secretary Dame Tessa 
Jowell, former Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart, Tory MPs Ian 
Liddell-Grainger, Caroline Nokes and Lorraine Fullbrook and several 
peers.

The fifteen women and five men get free membership, saving them £235-a-year each.

Former Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell is a member of parliament's WeightWatchers group and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott has spoken of his battle with bulimia

Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson, father of TV chef Nigella, wrote his own weight loss guide  - The Nigel Lawson Diet Book - which helped him to shed five stone in a year.

Tory MP Nadine Dorries said one of the reasons she took part in ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here was to lose weight.

Former Tory minister Anne Widdecombe went one better, losing 18 pounds over six months as a contestant on Celebrity Fit Club.

In 2008 former Labour Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott confessed to suffering from an eating disorder.

Explaining
 his battle with bulimia, he revealed he would 'sup a whole tin of 
condensed milk', eat trifles 'forever' and gorge at his local Chinese 
restaurant before vomiting.

Experts claim the waist-to-height ratio is a better measurement of health

Health experts now believe that central obesity (fat round the mid-section) is increasing at a faster rate than general weight.

So relying solely only on Body Mass Index 
(BMI) may provide inaccurate estimates of the childhood obesity epidemic, according to new research by Leeds 
Metropolitan University, published in Public Health journal.

Fat around the stomach is thought to be 
riskier than elsewhere on the body because it has a more direct effect 
on vital organs.

Yet BMI, which compares weight with height, does not 
take into account where on the body fat is found.

Tummy fat produces more 
dangerous chemicals, and it is also closer to the body’s vital organs 
than flab on the bottom, hips and thighs.

A staggering 60 per cent of teenage girls are obese by the time they reach 16, according to research that measures waistlines rather than BMI.

The
 waist of the average 15-year-old girl has expanded nearly 13cm (5in) in
 the past two decades, according to a study which finds that many 
children are even fatter than previously thought.
