Lorenzo Riggins proved that the customer is not always correct when he called police because his McDonald's order was shorted by one burger.

Riggins said he was hungry Tuesday night when he entered a McDonald's in East Albany, Georgia.

He ordered seven McDoubles, one McChicken and a fries.

Clueless: McDonald's customer Lorenzo Riggins was arrested when he called 911 over a botched order. He didn't realize it was illegal to call 911 when it wasn't an emergency

But when he got out to his car he realized that they got his order wrong: there were only six McDoubles in the bag.

So he went back in and asked for his order to be corrected, but the person behind the counter wasn't giving out service with a smile.

'She was trying to get an attitude with me and I said I'm going to call the police,' Riggins told WALB.

Riggins carried out that threat relaying his story to 911 operators.

They heard out his story, asked him where he was and asked him to wait at the McDonald's.

Attitude: Riggins was shorted a burger at this McDonald's in East Albany, Georgia - and when employee behind the counter refused to correct it, so he called police

When officers showed up, instead of confronting the McDonald's employees they arrested Riggins for misusing 911.

Arrested: Riggins spent a night in prison for the call

'I called the police and thinking that everything all cool by calling the police, I didn't know I was misusing 911,' he said.

Riggins was booked and spent a night in the Doughtery County Jail.

The next morning, a judge dropped his case saying the night in jail was enough punishment for the crime.

'It's really not funny. It's not,' Albany EMA and 911 Deputy Director Jim Vaught said. 'A person who was waiting to get a call in for an ambulance of a car wreck is having to wait - possibly.'

Vaught told KSDK that calling 911 is no joking matter, and does come with the threat of arrest if you misuse the line.

'The thing you need to understand is that we have their telephone number and we have their voice recorded and we will turn it over to the police department and you will be prosecuted,' Vaught warned.

While he's upset about the incident,Riggins said that it won't stop him from eating at McDonald's again.

'I would like to say check your food before you leave, always be careful when you go buy food anywhere you go,' advised Riggins.Â
