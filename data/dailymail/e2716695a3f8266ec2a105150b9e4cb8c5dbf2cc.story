Emma Stanfield, a hospital radio DJ, is appearing at Oxford Crown Court on charges of sexual activity with a child

A female hospital radio DJ had sex with a 15-year-old girl after plying her with alcohol, a court has heard.

Emma Stanfield and the alleged victim drank vodka before performing sex acts on each other on the sofa of a friend’s house, the court was told.

Prosecutor Michael Riley told the jury at Oxford Crown Court that 40-year-old Stanfield knew the girl was under 16 because the victim’s friend had told her.

The alleged victim, who cannot be named for 
legal reasons, had recently ended a relationship with another girl and 
was in the care of the local authority.

The court also heard that Stanfield was seen with the girl by a male colleague at the community station 105.1FM in Oxford, and she wrote on Facebook: 'He thinks you’re 17, so that’s a relief.'

Mr Riley told the jury of eight women and four men : 'There was a very significant age gap between the two of them. It was obvious this was a young girl. She (Stanfield) knew that she was under the age of 16.

'The Crown says the victim was not only under 16, she was also quite a vulnerable young girl because of her circumstances.'

Stanfield had previously worked on Radio Cherwell, a 24/7 hospital radio station in Oxford run by a charity. 

The jury heard that Stanfield, from Oxford, met up with a friend for drinks on the night of May 27 last year, and ended the night sleeping on her sofa.

When her friend left for work the next day, Stanfield began to drink vodka with her 16-year-old daughter, the court heard.

Stanfield allegedly told her she was 'pretty' and 'hot' and asked if she was interested in girls.

The girl replied that she was not, but that she had a friend who was - although she apparently warned Stanfield that she was under 16.

Mr Riley said that after being told by her friend about Stanfield, the 'curious' victim went around to the house.

The court heard that Stanfield gave her a glass of vodka before the three of them went to the radio station for a short time.

When they returned, the 16-year-old was put to bed as she was unwell.

Mr Riley said that Stanfield then turned her attention to the 15-year-old.

'What happened between them wasn’t to that extent without consent,' he said.

'Clearly she went along with it.'

Stanfield undressed and the two performed sex acts on each other, including Stanfield kissing the girl’s breast, said Mr Riley.

Prosecutor Michael Riley told the jury at Oxford Crown Court that 40-year-old Stanfield knew the girl was under 16 because the victim's friend had told her

Stanfield denies three counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity

After Stanfield left, there was a series of texts and Facebook messages between the two until the defendant was arrested on June 7, it was said.

These included the one with her radio colleague, who had asked if they slept together.

The jury heard that during police interviews, Stanfield made 'no comment' answers.

She denies three counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

The trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles, continues.
