West Ham United fans were booing at half-time but what a difference 45 minutes makes. Three goals, three points, no jeers, just cheers.

You have to wonder what West Ham boss Sam Allardyce was thinking as he went off at the break.

In the corresponding fixture against Hull City last season the Hammers were booed off after winning - a reaction that triggered Allardyce’s now infamous hand-cupped-to-the-ear gesture.

History repeated itself on Sunday, but Allardyce admitted his side deserved the flak, attributing his side’s poor first-half to an FA Cup hangover after Tuesday’s penalty shoot-out win over Everton.

‘We were not good in the first-half,’ he said. ‘When you have expectation of watching exciting games like the one against Everton it’s disappointing for fans to see us play so poorly,.

‘I’ve never seen us pass so poorly this season and that was a legacy of our efforts on Tuesday night.’

West Ham were far more direct in the second-half - a style for which in the past Allardyce has been criticised heavily - but the tactics paid dividends as goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing secured victory.

‘All this tippy-tappy stuff... everybody keeps going on about the right way to play football, it’s all a load of old b******s sometimes,’ said Allardyce. ‘Getting the ball in the opposition’s box as quickly as you can with quality is sometimes the best way forward.

‘That’s what we did second-half and that’s why we won the game.’

It wasn’t quite an X-rated tirade, but you could interpret Allardyce’s words as a riposte to those - West Ham fans among them - who continually criticise his tactics. Hull could not deal with West Ham’s second-half approach and, as a result, suffered a fourth defeat in five.

To make matters worse, their already lengthy injury list grew after injuries to James Chester and Alex Bruce.

‘James has dislocated his shoulder. If he needs surgery he could be out for at least two months,’ said manager Steve Bruce.

‘Alex has a thigh problem which could be him out for at least a month.

‘We were delighted with our first-half but you have to score when you’re on top. You can’t let good teams like West Ham off the hook.’

Indeed, Hull started quickly, winning two corners inside the first two minutes - both times after excellent play from Sone Aluko. After six minutes he set up Ahmed Elmohamady, who fired wide when unmarked.

Hull were given an insight of what was to follow in the 41st minute when Enner Valencia’s looping header hit the top of the bar.

That was not enough to stop the half-time jeers but Allardyce’s team were transformed after the break and went ahead in the 49th minute.

Valencia chanced a shot from 30 yards but though Allan McGregor parried the effort, Carroll nipped in front of Curtis Davies to tap home.

Just 10 minutes later it was 2-0, substitute Morgan Amalfitano converting Valencia’s pass, before Downing coolly slotted the third goal two minutes later.
