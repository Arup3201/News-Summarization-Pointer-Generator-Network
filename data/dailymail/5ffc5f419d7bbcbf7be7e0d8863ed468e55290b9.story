Indian opposition leader Narendra Modi appeared on course for a landslide win today in the country's weeks-long general election, with his party easily driving out the long-dominant Congress party in the world's biggest democracy.

The party now has a commanding lead in 272 seats, the majority needed to move forward without forming a coalition in the lower house of Parliament.

Although the results were yet to be finalised, Modi tweeted: 'India has won. Good days are coming.'

The Congress party, which has been at the center of Indian politics for most of the country's history since independence from Britain, conceded defeat several hours into the vote counting.

'We are accepting the people's verdict in all humility,' said party spokesman Shakil Ahmed.

'Trends of the counting are certainly not in our favor. The trends point out that the country has decided to vote against us.'

If the results are finalised, as expected
 it would be the first time a single party has won an outright majority 
since the 1984 national election.

The Election Commission was expected to announce full results later Friday. 

But early trends suggested that Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party would earn enough parliamentary seats to create a government without forming a coalition with regional leaders.

At BJP headquarters in New Delhi, workers were handing out sweets, setting off firecrackers and dancing outside in the streets. 

BJP spokeswoman Nirmala Seetharaman said the results were even better than expected.

'That
 certainly is good news, which we will savor with great delight,' she 
said. 'It means that people of India found the (connection) with 
Narendra Modi.'

There was a
 record turnout in the election, with 66.38 per cent of India's 814 
million eligible voters casting ballots during the six-week contest, 
which began April 7 and was held in stages across the country. Turnout 
in the 2009 general election was 58.13 per cent.

Campaigning
 on promises of a revival in economic growth, Modi and the BJP were 
looking to take advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the 
Congress party.

The BJP's slick and well-financed campaign also promised better governance.

The Congress-led ruling alliance has been plagued by repeated corruption scandals, and the Congress party's 43-year-old leader, Rahul Gandhi, failed to inspire public confidence.

A party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to form a government in India. If the BJP crosses the 272-mark, it would be the first time a single party has won a majority since the 1984 national election.

Exit polls by at least six major Indian TV stations predicted a BJP-led coalition would win between 249 and 289 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament.

By Friday afternoon, an exact picture was expected to emerge on what India's next Parliament will look like.

If the results are in line with the exit polls and the early trends and the BJP and its allies win a clear majority, India's stock markets are likely to see a major upswing.

Already on Friday, the Sensex stock index rose as much as 4.7 per cent on news of the BJP's strong showing.

The Nehru-Gandhi family, which has ruled India for all but 10 years since the country won independence from British rule in 1947, was facing its biggest political drubbing in 10 years.

The Congress party attempted to position Rahul Gandhi as a young leader capable of boosting the country's struggling economy, but most Indians see him as being out of touch with reality.

His privileged background has made him appear aloof and removed from the concerns of most Indians.

In comparison, Modi's campaign was seen by many as a media and marketing coup for a man whose background ties him to bloodshed in his home state of Gujarat, where communal rioting in 2002 left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.

Modi, the son of a tea seller who helped man his father's stall, is accused of doing little to stop the rampage, though he denies any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime.

He managed to hammer away at Gandhi - specifically the perception that he is nothing more than a feudal prince from a family that views ruling the country as its birthright.

The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has defined Indian politics for nearly a century faces more than a humiliating election defeat.

The landslide victory for opposition leader Narendra Modi could condemn the family to political oblivion.

Often
 described as a mixture of a royal family with the tragic glamour of the
 Kennedys, the dynasty gave India its first prime minister, the 
empire-beating barrister Jawaharlal Nehru.

His daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson, Rajiv, both held the post subsequently, and both were assassinated.

By some measures, the family was in decline long before the parliamentary election; it has not won a majority in decades.

Shy
 scion Rahul Gandhi's bid to keep the Congress party in power for a 
third consecutive term was called lacklustre even by allies, and his 
speeches at rallies up and down the country in recent months were a far 
cry from Nehru's legendary rhetoric.

Compare
 that with Modi's electrifying campaign, during which he repeatedly 
derided Rahul, 43, and his mother Sonia for keeping India poor, and the 
house of Gandhi looks vulnerable.

Few would write off the clan completely.

Sonia,
 the power behind the prime ministerial throne occupied by Manmohan 
Singh, delivered Congress its worst result to date in 1999. She then led
 the party to victory in the next two elections, and a year ago Forbes 
ranked her as the world's ninth-most-powerful woman.

Nonetheless,
 leaders of both Gandhi's Congress and Modi's Hindu nationalist 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said they believed Modi would seek to 
loosen the dynasty's grip on India.

They
 pointed to his home state of Gujarat, where he has systematically 
purged rivals from institutions and won three consecutive terms, 
capitalising on his pro-business policies.

'He
 will defang them politically. Look at what he did in Gujarat: he has 
just reduced the Congress to a non-player,' said Kanchan Gupta, member 
of the BJP's national executive committee.
