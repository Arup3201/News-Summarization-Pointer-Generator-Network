The three Tornado jet crew lost in a crash in the Moray Firth this week were named for the first time today as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond today paid tribute to the pilots.

Mr Hammond said Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole had been killed, and Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders were still missing presumed dead.

'My thoughts - and, I am sure, those of the entire House - are with their loved ones at this difficult time, and with the fourth member of the squadron involved in the incident, who is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital,' he told MPs.

The fatal mid-air crash off the north-east coast of Scotland between the two RAF Tornados may have been caused by fog, it was claimed earlier this week.

The two planes – each carrying a 
pilot and navigator – were not flying together but somehow collided at 
high speed in bad weather.

The pilots would not have spotted each other on their radar because it covers the ground and not the surrounding airspace.

This raises the possibility they simply flew into each other in fog thick enough to hamper the rescue operation.

One line of inquiry will be whether either crew asked ground radar stations if other aircraft were nearby.

Another
 is tiredness. Families of military personnel at RAF Lossiemouth say 
their loved ones were overworked and exhausted because of cutbacks.

RAF sources say these claims are 'wrong and appalling'.

Crash investigators will also explore the possibilities of mechanical failure, a bird strike and human error.

And
 independent experts from the Military Aviation Authority will look at 
the experience levels of the airmen at the controls of the planes.

The
 jets plunged into the Moray Firth about 25 miles south of Wick on 
Tuesday after completing a practice bombing raid on a Ministry of 
Defence firing range.

Two
 of the four airmen were plucked from the water and airlifted to 
hospital. It is understood they had tried to eject from their stricken 
warplane before it hit the water.

One was pronounced dead but the other 
is in intensive care at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. The search for the two
 missing airmen was terminated last night by the Maritime and Coastguard
 Agency, ending any hope of finding them alive.

Tragedy: More wreckage from one of the crashed 
planes is carried from the lifeboat after it arrived back in Buckie, a 
town close to where the incident happened. Two airmen were rescued and 
two are still missing

Group
 Captain Ian Gale, the Lossiemouth station commander, said the officer 
confirmed dead was from 15 (Reserve) Squadron, which trains pilots and 
weapon systems operators to fly the £40million Tornados.

'Two
 additional personnel remain unaccounted for. We must be realistic,' he 
added. 'Given the length of time that has elapsed since the accident, 
there is no expectation of recovering missing personnel alive.

'It
 is important that we establish the facts of what happened and it  is 
vital that the investigation is allowed to take its course.

'But the priority now is to ensure 
that the families of those involved receive the support they need at 
this most difficult of times.'

Crash: The two RAF planes crashed in the Moray Firth off the Scottish coast. It is understood they were on a training exercise and the crash happened in thick fog. It is not known if a technical fault is responsible

Speaking
 in the House of Commons, David Cameron paid tribute to the airmen. The 
Prime Minister said the incident was a reminder of the risks military 
personnel took in training as well as on operations.

'It's clearly a very serious incident,' he added.

Last
 night a relative of a serviceman at Lossiemouth said: 'The reason that 
these crashes are happening is because everybody is undermanned, the 
engineers are overworked.

'The planes are too old. They can no longer fix them properly.

'It's having a massive impact [on safety] because when they're flying, they're knackered.

'There's
 so much going round in their heads when they're flying now that it's 
very, very difficult to concentrate on flying. Somebody really high in 
the RAF is not saying to the Government, “We can't do that”.'

The claims were vehemently rejected by military sources.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'A full investigation into this incident will carried out by the Military Aviation Authority, which will be an independent investigation looking at all the possibilities of what might have happened.'

Wreckage from the planes has been found and the fuselages are likely to be salvaged this weekend.

The Tornados were understood to be on a low-flying exercise at the time of the accident.

Military sources said that the two jets had collided during the exercise but investigators will also look at whether either plane suffered a technical malfunction or accidentally ditched into the sea.

The fact that two crewmen had been recovered with dinghys and parachutes indicated they had managed to bail out of the doomed aircraft before it struck the water.

First Minister Alex Salmond said: 'This is clearly a very serious incident and my thoughts are with the loved ones of those affected.

'I understand rescue services have done all they can to help with the situation and offer my thanks to all those involved. The Scottish Government stands ready to offer any necessary assistance, and we will make a further statement once more details are confirmed.'

Moray MP Angus Robertson, the SNP’s defence spokesman, said: 'My first thoughts are with the crew, their families and colleagues. Everyone in Moray has a connection with the RAF and this incident will be felt right across the community.

'The priority must now be for the 
support of the affected families and for the authorities to investigate 
the causes of this incident and ensure the future safety of flying 
operations and personnel.'

RAF
 Lossiemouth is home to 617 Squadron - currently serving in Afghanistan -
 12 (Bomber) Squadron and 15 (Reserve) Squadron, which trains up to 40 
Tornado pilots and crew.

The
 Tornado GR4 is a two-seat attack aircraft which is capable of 
delivering a variety of bombs and missiles, including Brimstone, Paveway
 and Storm Shadow, has a maximum altitude of 50,000ft and a top speed of
 Mach 1.3.

The Tornado has 
been in service with the RAF since 1979 and the frontline squadrons are 
veterans of a string of conflicts with hundreds of hours flying 
experience.

It first saw combat in Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War and has since been deployed in Kosovo in 1999, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan since 2009, and last year enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya.

Tornado aircraft have been involved in crashes in Scotland in recent years.

In January last year two RAF crew were rescued after their Tornado GR4 jet came down in the sea off the west coast of Scotland. The crew, from RAF Lossiemouth, ejected from the plane before it landed in the waters at Loch Ewe, near Gairloch, Wester Ross.

In July 2009 an RAF pilot and navigator were killed when their Tornado jet crashed into a hillside in Argyll. Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Thompson, 27, and Flight Lieutenant Nigel Morton, 43, died in the crash near the village of Arrochar.

The aircraft was a RAF Leuchars-based Tornado F3 on a routine flight.

Warplane: The two-seater Tornado GR4 is a versatile and heavily-armed attack aircraft capable of supersonic speeds

The two-seater Tornado GR4 is a versatile and heavily-armed attack aircraft capable of supersonic speeds.

It has been flown in thousands of sorties during military operations since 1990, including Iraq, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and most recently, Libya.

RAF Lossiemouth in north Scotland is home to three of the six squadrons based in the UK - 12 (Bomber) Squadron, 617 Squadron and 15 (Reserve) Squadron.

The other three, 9 (Bomber) Squadron, 31 Squadron, and 2 (Army Co-operation) Squadron are based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.

According to the RAF website: 'The Tornado GR4 is a variable geometry, two-seat, day or night, all-weather attack aircraft, capable of delivering a wide variety of weapons.'

Its two RR RB199 Mk103 turbofan engines each produce 16,000lbs of thrust. It is 56.5ft (17.2m) long, has a span of 28.1ft (8.6m) and has a maximum altitude of 50,000ft (15 240m). Tornado GR4s are capable of flying at Mach 1.3, which is around 990mph.

'The aircraft can fly automatically at low level using Terrain Following Radar (TFR) when poor weather prevents visual flight. The aircraft is also equipped with Forward Looking InfraRed (FLIR) and is Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible,' the RAF website said.

The GR4 typically carries up to five Paveway IV smart weapons or two Storm Shadow cruise missiles. It is also equipped with the Storm Shadow missile and two variants of the Brimstone missile, and can be configured to carry other various weapons, targeting pods and reconnaissance pods.

All GR4 aircraft can carry the Air Launched Anti-Radiation Missile (ALARM), which homes on to the emitted radiation of enemy radar systems and can be used in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) role. It is also equipped with an integral 27mm Mauser cannon capable of firing 1,700 rounds per minute.
