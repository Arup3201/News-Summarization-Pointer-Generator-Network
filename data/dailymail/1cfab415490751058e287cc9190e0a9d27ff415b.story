NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is taking a job at a large Moscow website and starts work today.

The 30-year-old American fugitive's new role is surrounded by secrecy for 'security reasons', it was claimed.

But his lawyer has denied that Snowden will be a state employee.

News of his new role comes as a picture purporting to show Snowden on a tour boat on the Moscow river was shown by Life News.

The former National Security Agency contractor is behind a series of major intelligence links on US and British snooping of telephones and the internet.

New job: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden will start working for a large website in Moscow tomorrow

His Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, who denied the post was as a state employee, said: 'Edward starts work in November.'

'He will provide support for a large Russian site,' he said, refusing to name the new employer or give details of his role.

Snowden fled to Russia in June, hearing arrest and extradition to the US where he faces espionage charges.

President Vladimir Putin has rejected American pleas to send Snowden home to face charges including espionage, and the temporary asylum he was granted in early August can be extended annually.

Snowden has been spotted only a handful of times in Moscow.

The Russians imply there is a risk he could be kidnapped or assassinated by the CIA.

Western sources say the fact he is being concealed in Russia shows he is under the control of the Moscow secret services.

Not working for the Russians: Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia after going on the run from the US, is not taking up a state job according to his lawyer

A picture purporting to show Snowden was released on Thursday by a Russian site with close ties to the secret services.

He was wearing a cap, without glasses, leaning on the rail of a tour boat on the Moscow River. In the background is Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral.

The same website earlier this month published a photograph of Snowden pushing a shopping trolley, later confirmed as authentic by his Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena.

The photograph 'proves that the former US agent either lives permanently in Moscow or visits regularly,' claimed the site.
