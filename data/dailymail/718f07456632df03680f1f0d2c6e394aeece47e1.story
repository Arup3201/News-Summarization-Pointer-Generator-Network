World Cup winners Australia could arrive in England this summer with arguably the most fearsome pace attack in Test cricket since the ferocious West Indies sides of the 1980s.

Less than 48 hours after claiming their one-day prize, the Aussies turned their attention on the summer's Ashes series.

While captain Michael Clarke might have marked Sunday's final triumph over New Zealand by confirming his retirement from the 50-over game, his desire for Test cricket success burns as bright as ever.

Clarke was still recovering from a day-long champagne party with fans on the streets of Melbourne when the Aussies confirmed their squad to play a Test series in the West Indies before arriving in England for the start of the Ashes in July.

And if Alastair Cook & Co still have nightmare memories of the way they were blown apart by the pace of Mitchell Johnson as they suffered a 5-0 whitewash in Australia, then there is a new nightmare to come.

Australia could have as many as four bowlers who have all logged speeds of 90mph plus in their line-up, with both Johnson and his World Cup pace partner Mitchell Starc in the squad.

They will be backed up by Ryan Harris, who misses the West Indies trip to stay home for the birth of his first child but will then join up in time for the Ashes.

While 24-year-old James Pattinson is also not on the list because he is currently out with a damaged left hamstring, he will also be monitored with the chance to be included in time to travel to England.

Clarke will lead a side anxious to rub away bitter memories of their last Ashes tour when they were beaten 3-0 in 2013.

World Cup batting hero Steve Smith, who averaged only 38 in that series, is a far improved batsman now and will be expected to get big runs.

First Test

Cardiff (Jul 8-12)

Second Test

Lord’s (Jul 16-20)

Third Test

Edgbaston, (Jul 29-Aug 2)

Fourth Test

Trent Bridge (Aug 6-10)

Fifth Test

The Oval (Aug 20-24)

WHEN WILL ENGLAND NAME THEIR SQUAD?

Not until after three Tests in the West Indies and two at home to New Zealand, ending in June.

David Warner, axed from the early Tests and sent away in disgrace after throwing a punch at Joe Root in a nightclub, will also want to make his mark on the series.

National selector Rod Marsh told cricketaustralia.com.au: 'The Test team has performed very well in recent times, but the big challenge is to do that away from home.

'We believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important Test matches against the West Indies and England and will give us the best chance of success.'

Two players who starred in the World Cup campaign, Glenn Maxwell and James Faulkner, were tipped for the squad but have missed out. 

'Adam Voges and Fawad Ahmed had sensational seasons at domestic level and their performances just couldn't be ignored. They thoroughly deserve their call-up and the opportunity to be a part of this squad. We believe that both can play important roles in the side if required.

'Adam had one of the great seasons in Sheffield Shield history. He is an experienced player and quality character who will add talent and leadership to the touring party.

'Fawad has worked incredibly hard on his game and has demonstrated throughout the season that he can be a consistent wicket taker.

'Peter Nevill has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps. He has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye.'

Michael Clarke (capt)

Age 33

Caps 108

Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more.

David Warner

Age 28

Caps 36

Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two.

Shane Watson

Age 33

Caps 56

Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy.

Shaun Marsh

Age 31

Caps 12

Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks.

Mitchell Johnson

Age 33

Caps 64

Verdict If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia.

Josh Hazlewood

Age 24

Caps 3

Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well.

James Faulkner

Age 24

Caps 1

Verdict Played his only Test to date at The Oval in 2013, where he got up England’s noses by accusing them of boring batting. A left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, he can give the ball an almighty whack.

James Pattinson

Age 24

Caps 13

Verdict Injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011-12, but the talent is undeniable: tall, aggressive and fast, he should trouble England more than his brother, Darren, when playing for England in a single Test against South Africa in 2008.

Peter Siddle

Age 30

Caps 56

Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. 

Brad Haddin (wkt)

Age 37

Caps 63

Verdict Australia’s second-most important cog in their 5-0 Ashes wheel in 2013-14, after Mitchell Johnson. His sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team.

Chris Rogers

Age 37

Caps 20

Verdict This will be his last hurrah in a late-blooming Test career. Calm, compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner Warner.

Steve Smith (vice captain)

Age 25

Caps 26

Verdict One of world cricket’s rising stars, he scored four tons in Australia’s recent home series against India. Will captain the side full-time after Clarke retires, and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg-spin.

Nathan Lyon 

Age 27

Caps 39

Verdict A steady off-spinner who troubled England’s right-handers  during whitewash. But, really, they should have nothing to fear.

Mitchell Starc

Age 25

Caps 15

Verdict Another left-arm seamer, and Man of the Tournament at the World Cup. His yorkers are as dangerous in Tests as they are in ODIs, and  accuracy and pace have improved.

Ryan Harris

Age 35

Caps 27

Verdict If he can drag his injury-laden body through one final series, Australia will be thrilled. He was an unsung star during their 3-0 defeat here two years ago, and produced the ball of the series to bowl Cook in Perth.

Josh Hazlewood

Age 24

Caps 3

Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. 

Fawad Ahmed

Age 33

Caps 20

Verdict The Pakistan-born leg-spinner has played only three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games for Australia, so would represent a risk. But Australian leggies have done well in England before…

Michael Clarke (capt)

Age 33

Caps 108

Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more.

David Warner

Age 28

Caps 36

Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two.

Shane Watson

Age 33

Caps 56

Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy.

Shaun Marsh

Age 31

Caps 12

Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks.

Mitchell Johnson

Age 33

Caps 64

Verdict If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia.

Peter Siddle

Age 30

Caps 56

Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. 

Mitchell Marsh

Age 23

Caps 4

Verdict A rangy all-rounder and younger brother of Shaun, Marsh stunned England during the World Cup with figures of 5 for 33 at Melbourne – despite having taken only six ODI wickets until then. His batting is the stronger suit.

Peter Nevill

Age 29

Caps 0

Verdict Peter who? Nevill has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his New South Wales team-mate Haddin, although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team. Unlikely to get a game unless Haddin breaks a finger.

Adam Voges

Age 35

Caps 0

Verdict An outsider for a Test debut, but he knows English conditions well – Voges has spent time with Hampshire, Middlesex and Nottinghamshire – and bowls left-arm spin to complement his middle-order hitting.
