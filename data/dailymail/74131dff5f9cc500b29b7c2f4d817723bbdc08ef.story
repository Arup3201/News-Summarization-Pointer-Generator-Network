Mother-of-two Janine Mallett drowned on an Ibiza beach after ingesting ecstasy and cocaine, an inquest has heard

A mother-of-two found dead on an Ibiza beach with high levels of ecstasy and cocaine in her body had been warned by her husband to stay away from drugs, an inquest has heard.

Janine Mallett was found on S’Arenal beach on the Spanish island on July 6 last year.

Teesside Magistrates’ Court heard that the 31-year-old had drowned after losing consciousness - and a pathologist said there was evidence of 'voluntary ingestion of cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine and methamphetamine'.

But Mrs Mallett’s husband Iain told the inquest that his wife was 
'completely anti-drugs' - and that he had warned her about drugs being 'in her face' on the party island.

And the court heard conflicting statements from friend Aimee Owens, a student at Teesside University, who went on holiday with Mrs Mallett - one which confirmed the pair had taken drugs, and one which said they had not.

The
 first was given to Spanish police - which Ms Owens says was taken by an officer who spoke poor English. She said it was written in Spanish and not read 
out to her before she signed it.

In
 this statement, Ms Owens said that her and Mrs Mallett had been 
drinking vodka and lemonade poolside at their hotel, the Club Maritimo 
in Ibiza, before going out in San Antonio.

While out, the statement said the pair bought a light pink ecstasy tablet from a man for 10 euros, and took half each.

Later, they bought two dark pink, slightly smaller, ecstasy tablets from an African man for 15 euros.

They took half of one each, and both later took the other half.

Mrs Mallett was found on S'Arenal beach on the Spanish island on July 6 last year. Teesside Magistrates' Court heard medical evidence that the 31-year-old had died from drowning

However
 in a second statement given back in England on March 15, 2014, Ms Owens
claimed tthat Mrs Mallett had not taken any drugs at all.

A
 pathology report conducted in England by Dr Nigel Cooper at the 
University Hospital of North Tees on July 18 concluded that Mrs Mallett,
 of in Thornaby, had high levels of MDMA in her system and had died as a
 result of drowning, or from the effects of MDMA.

This report also found alcohol and traces of cocaine.

Ms Owens - who was carrying Mrs Mallett’s shoes and handbag - said she had lost sight of Mrs Mallett near the beach.

Ms Owens said she looked for her, before getting a taxi back to their hotel and waiting up and searching the area.

She searched again the next morning, but reported Mrs Mallett missing to the hotel reception at around 11.30am.

Shortly after, two paramedics came to the hotel and asked Ms Owens if her friend had a tattoo on her hip and piercings - before they confirmed her friend had been found dead in the sea at around 10.45am.

Mrs Mallett was described during the inquest as a 'very special lady' who was devoted to her family.

But Mrs Mallett's husband Iain, told the inquest that he warned his wife that drugs would be 'in her face' and that she was 'completely anti-drugs'

In a statement, Mr Mallett said: 'She was one of those special people who lit up a room.'

Mr Mallett’s statement described how his wife had not wanted to go on the holiday and leave their two children, Jack and Evelyn, who were five and three at the time.

'I talked her into going because she never did anything for herself, she only thought of her family.

He said that his wife had never taken recreational drugs in her life and was 'very anti-drugs' as well as being anti-smoking - even making him give up cigarettes when they first met.

Mrs Mallett drank alcohol occasionally but was a responsible drinker.

The inquest also heard that Mrs Mallett, who had been made redundant from her job as a team leader at a call centre, had been volunteering as a teaching assistant at a local school after completing a college course.

Mrs Mallett never received the news that staff at the school were set to offer her a paid job.

Before she went away she left a note reminding her husband to look after their children, Jack and Evelyn before signing it off saying: 'I just want to tell you how much I love you and I'm going to miss you like crazy.'

Acting Coroner Clare Bailey recorded an open verdict.

She said: 'I am prepared to accept the medical opinion.

'No evidence has been provided for Mrs Mallett taking the drugs. We also have no evidence explaining her movements from when she was last seen to when her body was found.

'We cannot say how she ingested the drugs or what steps led to her being found in the water.'
