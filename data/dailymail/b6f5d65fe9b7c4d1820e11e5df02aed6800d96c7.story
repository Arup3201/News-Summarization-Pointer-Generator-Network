David Hayes, 79, has been left with three metal spikes sticking out of his gums for a decade

A pensioner has been left with three metal spikes sticking out of his gums for more than a decade, as dentists argue over who should treat him.

David Heys from Bradley, had an operation to install special implants in his gums to fix his dentures in place.

But the work, which was carried out in the late 1990s, is now causing the 79-year-old severe problems, leaving him unable to eat solid food.

Mr Heys claims he has been dismissed at every turn in his quest to seek help, being referred from one specialist to another.

His dentist, Gencare in Huddersfield said it does not have the expertise to solve the problem.

But after waiting months for an appointment at specialist hospital, the Leeds Dental Institute, Mr Heys said he was told to go back to his normal surgery.  

No sooner than he did that was he referred back to the Leeds hospital again.

The 79-year-old said he believes his was an emergency case, because he was starting to suffer other health problems as a result of his inability to eat.  

A letter from a dentist at Gencare to Leeds Dental Institute, said: 'It is beyond my ability to provide Mr Heys with a suitable new implant retained denture.

'Thus, I am referring him for diagnosis and treatment as you see appropriate.'

Mr Heys said it is now more than two years since he began asking dentists for help.

He said he feels let down by the Leeds hospital after waiting months for a consultation in September.

'They haven't done the job they should have done,' he said. 'They've done two repairs which lasted only a few days and now they're not prepared to see me for another six months.

'I feel very neglected. I have paid into the system all my life.

'If the hospital can't do it how can they expect a local dentist to do it?'

He claims he has been dismissed by every part of the health service, being referred from one specialist to another. He says the three spikes can hurt his tongue and leave him at risk of choking

Mr Heys had an operation to install special implants in his gums to fix his dentures in place. He says if he puts the ill-fitting device in his mouth it aggravates problems in his  throat and stomach

Mr Heys said if he leaves his dentures out the three spikes can hurt his tongue and leave him at risk of choking.

But if he puts the ill-fitting device in his mouth he said it aggravates problems in his mouth, throat and stomach.

Calls to the patient advice service Healthwatch Kirklees and his MP have failed to bring any assistance.

Mr Heys believes his problem is urgent, but it  is now more than two years since he began asking dentists for help

A spokesman for Leeds Dental Institute said: 'Mr Heys is a long-standing patient and we have been doing our best over a number of years to help him with his dental implants and over-denture.

'Unfortunately the original O-rings for his implant system are no longer available. 

'However to assist him we did manage to source O-rings for his retained over-denture from another supplier. These allow an appropriate fit and are designed to last up to a year.

'He was seen by us recently after a referral and his fractured denture was repaired, and on that basis he was discharged from our care.

'Ongoing maintenance and repairs of his dentures can and should be undertaken by a primary care dentist in conjunction with a dental laboratory.

'The Dental Institute is a specialist centre for complex procedures and it is not the most appropriate use of our time and skills to continue to undertake primary care maintenance of dentures, nor is it in the best interests of Mr Heys in getting a timely response to his ongoing needs.

'Our existing workload means that specialist secondary care and appointments at the Dental Institute are booked up six weeks ahead.

'None of Mr Heys' dental requirements are classed as clinically urgent and they are most appropriately dealt with in primary dental care.

'Separately from this, Mr Heys does have the option of replacing his implant attachments with a more universal system.

'This has been discussed with him previously. This would be an appropriate reason for a further referral to the institute.'
