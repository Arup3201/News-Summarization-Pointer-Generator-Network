He was there to accept an honorary doctorate but all everyone was wondering was if former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe was dating singer Ricky Martin.

Adding 'doctor' to his Order of Australia and the five Olympic Gold medals he won during his swimming career, Thorpe accepted an honorary doctorate from Sydney's Macquarie University on Wednesday.

Thorpe received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 2001 for his service to sport after he came away from the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games as a gold medalist.

The awarding of the honorary doctorate comes just two months after he came out as gay in a television interview with former British chat show king Michael Parkinson.

Thorpe told Daily Mail Australia he had been doing well since his admission, which finally laid to rest years of speculation about his sexuality.

'Things have been good, I'm really happy and glad to be home,' he said.  

Since the interview, Thorpe has also been linked to The Voice Australia judge Ricky Martin who has been a pillar of support for the sports star. 

But on Wednesday he denied the romance.

'I've said it before, they're not true,' Thorpe - who has won five Olympic gold medals - told Daily Mail Australia with a laugh.

Speculation the pair were a couple was sparked after the Latino star sent a tweet of support to the 31-year-old sporting champion when the latter came out.

'Congrats @Ian Thorpe! Brave man! Happy for you! Million appreciate what you’ve done! Proud of you!' Ricky Martin wrote at the time.

As a man used to the spotlight, Thorpe seemed nervous as he accepted the honorary doctorate from his alma mater and imparted some wisdom on business graduates at Macquarie University. 

The always humble Olympian - who was wearing a black velvet cap with two gold tassels and a satin white-and-red cloak - apologised for not being actor Cate Blanchett who was recently presented with the same honour.

'I know some of you may be tremendously disappointed. Cate Blanchett gave one of these addresses just a week ago and you're stuck with me,' Thorpe joked. 

At first, the Thorpedo was nervous but soon he eased into his speech, and posed for photos for the media afterwards

Thorpe studied a Bachelor of Arts at the university and also trained in its swimming pool

Thorpe also spoke frankly about how he was not someone who was good with compliments.

'I struggle with being complimented or commended. I find it easier to be criticised,' Thorpe told the 600-strong crowd during the graduation ceremony.

'To excel as a champion does not sit comfortable with most. To be on the top, there really is only one other way and it's not down.

'They also say when you reach number one, you should work like number two.

'But I would not do this because I do not see the point of ever expecting second best, nor should you.'

He is known affectionately by the public as the Thorpedo because of his swimming prowess
