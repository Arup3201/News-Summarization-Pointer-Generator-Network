A fan of weed, comedy, and quality burritos found himself in an awkward situation after mistaking a parody commercial for the real thing and firing off an angry e-mail to Chipotle. 

A Reddit user posting under the screen name 'StumpNuts' recounted the story about how he dozed off while getting high at the wrong time.

He'd been watching a new episode of Parks and Recreation, which has been lacing its episodes with jokes about the near future in its final season set in 2017.

One Reddit user found himself in an awkward situation after mistaking a parody commercial for the real thing and firing off an angry e-mail to Chipotle's complaint department 

The exchange was posted on Reddit, where it soon became a viral hit

StumpNuts woke up right in the middle of an ad that seemed to be touting a merger between the upscale Mexican chain and fossil fuel behemoth Exxon, The Daily Dot reports. 

'For some stupid reason I was pissed,' StumpNuts wrote on Reddit. 'Hell, Chipotle just took an item off the menu because of the way they were treating animals, how could they possibly justify teaming up with a company who is destroying the planet?!'

He decided to give Chipotle a piece of his mind writing: 'Now you've teamed up with Exxon, a company who is destroying the planet and laughing about it as they run away from their responsibilities to the environment.'

Luckily for the Reddit user Chipotle understood his confusion and invited him in anytime

Luckily his missive found its way to an understanding corporate rep. 

'We definitely haven’t partnered with Exxon,' the rep responded. 'The only thing I can find online that might suggest this is a fake commercial that aired on Parks & Rec recently. Which is an awesome show as far as I’m concerned, but I’m sorry if it caused any confusion!'

StumpNuts, or Alex as the posted e-mails reveal his first name, sent off an apology and explanation. 

'Glad to have set you straight, Alex,' the amused rep wrote back. 'The next time the munchies hit, hopefully you can head for Chipotle and fell good about where your money is going.'
