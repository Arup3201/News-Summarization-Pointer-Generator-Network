Usain Bolt may be convinced he can star for Manchester United, but his first stop in English football looks set to be at Millwall.

The fastest man in the world, who struck Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay with Jamaica last weekend, should receive an invite from fellow countryman Ricardo Fuller to make a trip to The Den in the coming months.

Fuller explained the pair know each other from back home - going out for a drink during downtime this summer - and Bolt wouldn’t hesitate in saying yes to taking in a game.

‘The next time Bolt is in London I am going to invite him to watch a Millwall game at The Den,’ the 34-year-old said ahead of the new Championship season, which the Lions kick-off against Leeds at home on Saturday.

‘And though he supports Man United, I know he will come here. Who knows? He might even start supporting us after!’

That trip could be sooner than expected. The six-time Olympic champion stays and trains with his agent in Teddington, south west London, when competing on the continent and is pencilled in to run at the Diamond League meeting in Zurich on August 28; Ian Holloway’s side host Fuller’s old club Blackpool two days later.

‘I saw Bolt when I went home in the summer,’ Fuller added. ‘We always hang out together and go for a drink. It’s normal. Everybody knows everybody in Jamaica.

‘Even though people might see him as this so-called superstar, he is just a normal guy. You could pass Bolt on the street and say hi. He wouldn’t be able to do that here, but it is different in Jamaica.’

Bolt’s friend Fuller signed a one-year deal with Millwall in July and, although he is very much an elder statesman in the group, is putting younger colleagues to shame across the ground in pre-season. Hardly surprising, the striker rationalises, given his nationality.

‘Bolt’s trainer, Glen Mills, used to coach me on the track as well,’ he added. ‘Me and Carlos Edwards (35) are the fastest players in training. The stats show it. We posted the same time. Bang on. But I should have broken the record – I let him off the hook!’

There may be charisma and measured arrogance radiating from Bolt, but Millwall’s Jamaican isn’t missing much swagger either. Fuller insisted he took a four-week break before finally committing to the club.

‘I spent the first month enjoying myself, seeing family and friends and then after the first month I started training and getting back into it,’ he said. ‘I knew about Millwall over a month before I came here. Blackpool also wanted to do something but we all know about the problems they are having.’
