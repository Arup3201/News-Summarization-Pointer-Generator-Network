She was just 15 years old when her brother's plane went down off the coast of Broome, Western Australia during World War II.

But this week, Val Bullied, who is now 85, received the closure her family had been desperately searching for, for almost 70 years.

On September 14, 1944, Sergeants Ronald Kerrigan from North Perth and Ronald Smith from Strathfield in NSW went missing in action when their plane crashed into the ocean off Cable Beach.

Then, two years ago local historian Dion Marinis and helicopter pilot Jim Miles began the long and involved search for the RAAF Beaufighter A19-163.

On Sunday, after the discovery of the second engine from the plane, the two men were able to confirm that the wreckage was in fact exactly what they had been searching for.

'Finding the engines was the big finale of the two year search,' said Mr Miles, a helicopter pilot and part-time professional diver told the MailOnline.

'You sort of have mixed feelings, it's very emotional,' Mrs Bullied said.

She said she was very grateful to the pair and is glad to have closure - despite the heartbreaking fact that no other family members who knew her brother are still with her to share in the joy.

The 85-year-old told of how her family always knew where the plane went down, but no one thought to look for it until now.

Dion Marinis and Jim Miles, who spent two years searching for part of the wreck, concluded their search on Sunday

The Beaufighter A19-163 went down in the early hours of September 14, 1944

'We were told where it was. I was very excited when they found it.'

'When they dive they're putting themselves at risk,' she said, speaking of the huge effort Mr Marinis and Mr Miles have put into discovering the wreckage.

Mr Marinis is Vice President of the Broome Historical Museum, and said he has always had a 'passion' for WWII.

However, this particular search was different, and he told of how important the discovery was for the local community.

'I was mainly driven personally for the family and for the history of Broome,' he said.

'It's been an amazing journey and it's been quiet humbling to be able to find the wreckage.'

'It was very exciting, even though at times it can be very harrowing.'

Mr Miles echoed his sentiments, and said it was very difficult to describe the feeling of finishing the puzzle.

'It's a very moving moment when you finally put all the pieces together, it's a bit hard to explain.'

The site off Cable Beach, WA, where the aircraft was discovered will now be protected under maritime law

The search was a very long and difficult process using a combination of sidescan sonar, metal detection and diving, kick-started by the simple spotting of an article in the local paper.

'I found a snippet in the paper that just said a fighter lost off the coast of Broome,' Mr Marinis said.

From there, the two men teamed up and spent years scanning and surveying the area with their own equipment, an extremely difficult task given the plane went down in a rock field.

This coming September a memorial will be held in honour of the pilot and navigator who lost their lives in the crash, and Mrs Bullied said she will travel the long distance from her home in Perth to attend.

After the discovery of this wreck, The two men have many more sites in their sights

The site will become a protected area under maritime law, and the men now have their sights set on making more discoveries in the future.

A helicopter pilot and profession diver part-time, Mr Miles said all though the mystery of this particular wreck is wrapped up, he has many more on his plate.

'There are 20 more wrecks that I want to locate, they're all over the world.'

The various wrecks lie in locations all around Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea.
