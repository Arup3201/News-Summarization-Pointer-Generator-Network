Tweeted her rant at the Italian fashion house for their summer 2013 show

Songstress Azealia Banks is no stranger to controversy.

After she burst onto the music scene with her crude lyrics and her Dazed and Confused album cover was banned in seven countries because it featured a blown-up condom, it instantaneously became clear that the New Yorker isn't one to bite her tongue.

And the 21-year-old Harlem rapper didn't hold back when it came to Dolce & Gabbana. The star tweeted that she is 'definitely boycotting' Dolce & Gabbana for the 'corny, racist' imagery in their spring 2013 collection.

The label raised some eyebrows when they sent only white models down the runway wearing earrings with plastic heads of dark-skinned women

The Italian fashion house raised some eyebrows when they sent an army of all-white models down the runway donning controversial earrings featuring dark-skinned women wearing burlap dresses and plantation-era cornucopias.

'Whoever designed that racist ass Dolce and Gabanna collection needs a swift kick in the mouth and a big d--- up the ass,' she tweeted on Saturday.

'I really hate when people do corny, racist things then try to justify it as "art. It's all just really unnecessary. the clothes in the collection were fine without all the "black mammie" imagery' she added.

Dolce & Gabbana representatives said that the imagery used is said to be inspired by their Sicilian roots.

Azealia was left riled by the earrings donned in the show this season
