Figures by MoneySupermarket also found men were twice as likely to have a conviction than women (file picture)

Rural motorists are twice as likely to have a drink-drive conviction than their ‘urban’ counterparts, a new report reveals today.

And building workers top the list of jobs where motorists most likely to have  a drink- or drug driving conviction .

Across the UK it is drivers from the North of Scotland, Wales and Northern England who top the list of post-codes with the highest  rates of drink-driving.

And men are twice as likely to offend as women.

The figures are revealed from  analysis of  nearly 12 million car insurance quotes by comparison website MoneySuperMarket.

The MoneySuperMarket report says: ‘Drivers in rural areas have a higher proportion of drink and drug driving convictions than those living in urban hubs.

Motorists in north Scotland and mid Wales are the most likely to have a conviction (a rate of 1.51 and 1.4 convictions per 1000 quotes per year respectively), double that of those living in the Greater London region (0.77 convictions).

Those in London are the least likely.

Scotland
and Wales dominate the postcode breakdown – representing six of the 
UK’s top ten postcodes for drivers with a drink or drug driving 
conviction.

Across the UK Aberdeen tops the list 
with a rate of 1.521 convictions per 1,000 insurance quotes, followed 
by Inverness (1.491), Swansea (1.490), Dundee (1.486), Carlisle (1.485),
Cardiff (1.471), Blackpool (1.443),  Stoke-on-Trent (1.390), Kirkcaldy 
(1.387) and Telford (1.381).

At
the other end of the scale, London postcodes predominate in the 10 
areas with the lowest drink-drive convictions, along with Bradford, 
Liverpool and Manchester.

The report notes:’ Blue-collar professions are the most likely to have a drink or drug driving conviction.’

Scaffolders are revealed as the 
worst, registering 4.6 convictions per 1000 quotes per year, followed by
builders labourers, roofers and floor layers all with 4.0 convictions 
per 1000.

Midwives and 
paramedics  have least number of offences for drink or drug driving , in
a ‘bottom 10’ group which includes along with police officers, taxi 
drivers and driving instructors.

The
car insurance research searches reveals those aged 20 to 24 years old 
had the highest conviction rate, at 2.3 convictions per 1000 quotes per 
year, while drivers aged 50 to 64 are less likely to have a conviction, a
lower rate of 0.5 per 1000 quotes.

Men have a rate of 1.4 per 1000 per year of driving, compared to a rate of 0.6 for women.

Failed tests: The statistics revealed building workers top the list of jobs where motorists most likely to have a drink- or drug driving conviction

Kevin Pratt, car insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket.com, said: ‘The manual occupations at the top of the table are typical ‘thirsty’ jobs, where many workers finish work relatively early and go to the pub.

They’re also jobs that involve early starts, driving to the site and starting work first thing the morning, even after a night out.

There’s a risk workers can take to the road before the alcohol has left their system, which means they would read positive if breathalysed. ‘

Simon Best, chief executive of the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) said: ‘A hard day’s work may seem a good justification for a quick pint on the way home but responsibility for your and others safety comes with every driving licence.’

Drink-driving offences  can lead to fines of up to £5,000, a 12-month driving ban and in some circumstances a possible prison sentence. Drivers may also see their insurance premiums rocket by an average of £315.
