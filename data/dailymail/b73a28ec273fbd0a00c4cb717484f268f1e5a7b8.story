A Delta airlines flight from Cleveland to New York City was so badly delayed that by the time it took off there were only two passengers left to get on board.

The scheduled 7:15am service from Ohio to New York's LaGuardia airport was hit by delay after delay throughout Monday, and didn't take off until around 6pm that evening.

By that time almost everybody had been moved to other flights - at one point leaving just one man on board the service with a full flight crew, who gave him a personal in-flight safety drill.

Chris O'Leary, a media strategist from Brooklyn, was told of the ongoing delays by text, so waited in his hotel until the flight was finally ready to leave.

In the mean time, other passengers who had gone to the airport were booked onto different New York-bound flights, ABC News reported.

O'Leary was almost the only passenger on the flight, but another man arrived to board seconds before the plane turned down the runway.

The other man slept for the length of the plane journey, making for a very quiet ride.

O'Leary told ABC: 'It was definitely the most memorable flight I've been on in recent memory... There were no screaming babies, no one listening to loud lyrics or reclining their seats or taking their shoes.'
