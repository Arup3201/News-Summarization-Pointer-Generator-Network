Weekly jab: New injection could bring relief to millions of type 2 diabetes sufferers in Britain

A weekly diabetes jab has been approved for use on the NHS - replacing the need for twice-a-day injections for millions of diabetes sufferers.

Today the UK's Health Service rationing body confirmed initial guidance given in October, that doctors can prescribe Bydureon - a slow-release form of the generic drug exenatide.

In final draft guidance, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) said the £18-a-week jab could be given in
combination with certain other drugs in obese patients, or those for whom insulin injections wouldn't be 
suitable.

It could spell the end of sufferers having to inject themselves with exenatide twice a day.

Although Primary Care Trusts were able to start issuing the drug from October, it is likely to be far more widely prescribed when NICE publishes the final guidance in February.

Bydureon provides the first treatment for type 2 diabetes which can be administered just once a week.

Professor Carole Longson, NICE's health technology evaluation center director, 
said: '2.25 million people in the U.K. are now affected by Type 2 
diabetes, therefore it is important that there are a range of effective 
treatment options, such as prolonged-release exenatide, available to 
them.

'Type 2 diabetes is a serious, progressive disease; I am sure all 
those affected will welcome this positive final draft recommendation.'

Bydureon works in the same way as exenatide but is released much more slowly so the number 
of injections needed is reduced dramatically.

When blood sugar levels are high, the drug induces the pancreas to produce more insulin. This stops so much glucose being produced and released into the bloodstream.

Type 2 diabetes often hits people aged over 40. The number of sufferers is expected to rise significantly in the coming years because of unhealthy diets.

Gila monster: Drug replicates hormone found in the Mexican lizard

It can be treated through injections along with a healthy diet and exercise.

Bydureon works by recreating a hormone found in the Gila Monster lizard which limits the amount of sugar in the blood.

The reptile, found in Mexico, eats just four meals per year but digests them very slowly.

An estimated 850,000 people in Britain have type 2 diabetes which has not been diagnosed.

Around a quarter of people given the once a week Bydureon injections suffer from nausea as a side effect.
