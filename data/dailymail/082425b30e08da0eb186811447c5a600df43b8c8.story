There was a time when yoga was all breathing heavily on a mountaintop or floor mat while bending in and out of the downward dog.

Sometimes you used a block or a belt. Perhaps you did it in a roomful of other people. Occasionally there was some incense burning. Perhaps a little light muzak.

But these days you can't carry out a sun salutation unless the room temperature is cranked up to 105 degrees Farenheit, you're lying on a surfboard or a horse with your pet Jack Russell or your baby crouched upon your back, while you tooting on a harmonica for an entire hour and an energising dinner is served up on the floor the very second you've hummed your third ohm.

Fierce Grace, a hot power yoga of classical Hatha, sweaty Bikram and Ashtanga Vinyasa, is the latest kid on the bendy block

Fierce Grace is described as 'sequenced in ways that adhere to ancient yogic principles as well as the latest cutting-edge research on attaining optimum results in the minimum amount of time'

And Fierce Grace, a hot power yoga of classical Hatha, sweaty Bikram and Ashtanga Vinyasa, is the latest kid on the bendy block.

Founder Michele Pernetta, a hot yoga teacher for over 20 years, brought Bikram to London in 1994, but has now broken away from the teachings of its founder Bikram Choudhury.

A yoga master who has taught over 20,000 students in her four studios and all over the world, Pernetta is also a martial arts blackbelt and a massage therapist who has judged the Bishnu Gosh International Yoga Championships 
and taught seminars all over Europe.

Pernetta said: 'With Fierce Grace I have created the yoga class I always wanted to do myself'

She describes her new practice as 'sequenced in ways that adhere to ancient 
yogic principles as well as the latest cutting-edge research on 
attaining optimum results in the minimum amount of time.'

Held in a room heated to 95 degrees Fahrenheit - marginally less sweltering than most hot yoga classes - Fierce Grace is a five-class system of interconnecting sequences, based on the same core poses and philosophy, but with a different emphasis or focus.

She said: 'With Fierce Grace I have created the yoga
class I always wanted to do myself.

'Presented in five ways which 
address our changing needs, it is taught in a motivating and no-nonsense
way that empowers the student to become their own teacher and connects 
them with the backbone of real spirituality, while getting them super 
fit and healthy. I wanted to offer a system that excluded no one.'

Core (75 minutes)

Master the 
building blocks of a great yoga practise. This class allows beginners 
and advanced students alike to take the time to address their needs, 
understand alignment and how to effectively work for maximum results. 
More hands-on corrections and help for injuries and misalignment. An 
intense warm up prepares the body for long, deep stretches to realign, 
resolve and release.

Classic (80 minutes)

Our version of the 
traditional hot yoga class with more hip openers, arm, ab and bum toners
for a rounded workout. Based on Pernetta’s 20 years experience, the 
changes to the well known Bikram system allow the student some freedom 
to explore, to move into some pose variations and have some fun.

Fierce Grace (80mins + 10 min optional meditation)

Our challenging 
but user-friendly general level class. This class combines the central 
poses of Bikram, hatha and Ashtanga with deep twists, core 
strengthening, interval-training wisdom, groan inducing abdominal work, 
hip openers and delicious floor stretches to relax the body and mind.  
Performed to music.

Fierce (aka The Beast) - 1hr 45 mins)

advanced class that takes students to the next level in strength,

encouraging non-judgemental way the class includes arm balancing, 
inversions, lotus poses and deep backbends.

The Fix (50 mins)

A 
high-octane caffeine injection for the motivated person on a tight 
schedule.  An effective no-frills yoga fitness regime, this 50 minute 
class combines

Fierce Grace classes are held in Primrose Hill, north London, and will be rolled out across the country from 2014

BABY YOGA

Thought to relax babies, help parents bond with their new child, encourage deep sleep and promote healthy digestion, baby yoga is becoming increasingly popular among families.

TODDLER YOGAEncouraging young children to practice supervised yoga helps them develop flexibility and core strength from an early age. Yoga has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of sickness in children, from reduction in headaches to improved concentration. Studies show children on the autistic spectrum benefit from yoga practice.

DOG YOGA

Known as 'doga', doing yoga with your dog is said to appeal to your pet’s natural instinct to stretch, has become a new fad among New York dog-owners who believe it creates a unique bonding experience. Classes involve stretching, massage and even chanting - at a pitch the dogs can mimic.

ANTI-GRAVITY YOGA

Practiced in a hammock, anti-gravity yoga was created by gymnasts but has been modified and enhanced to fit into the yoga mold and cater to the everyday athlete. It aims to get you in shape while realigning you from the compression of gravity.

LAUGHTER YOGAThe concept of laughter yoga is based on the idea that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter: one gets the same physiological and psychological benefits. Clinical research conducted at Bangalore, India and America has proved that laughter lowers the level of stress hormones such as epinephrine and cortisol.

HOT POD YOGA

Vinyasa yoga practiced in a heated inflatable room, allowing teachers to pop-up all over the country. Warmth helps the body quickly enter the practice, warming the muscles and aiding flexibility. Throughout the class it makes the heart work harder, increases the soothing nature of the environment and helps bring us out in a good sweat, so you get maximum benefits in a relatively short time.

VOGAThe brainchild of Juliet Murrell, a successful set designer in the fashion, film and design industry who qualified as a yoga instructor to restore her natural energy levels, which had been depleted by post-viral chronic fatigue. Identifying a niche for a more expressive, energetic style of yoga, Juliet went on to create VOGA, a stretching and posing routine set to an iconic 80s beat.
