Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is under no illusions about the potential repercussions of Monday night’s visit to Old Trafford.

Any clash against Manchester United, particularly in the Wenger era, carries added value for the Gunners. The fact that it is an FA Cup quarter-final with a place at Wembley at stake merely adds to the occasion.

And for Wenger it’s a chance to land what could be a crucial psychological blow on Louis van Gaal’s side ahead of the tense season finale.

The FA Cup isn’t the only competition in which these two giants are going toe to toe. They are also battling for a Champions League position, a race which is perhaps more pertinent to both clubs’ long-term ambitions.

There are no points at stake tonight but Wenger said: ‘It’s a big game, and every big win in a big game has an impact subconsciously in the belief of the team.’

However, the reverse is also true. Losing against United could plant a seed of doubt in Arsenal’s quest to finish in the top four — and their poor recent record at Old Trafford doesn’t bode well. United have won nine out of their last 10 home games against the Gunners.

We shouldn’t forget, though, that Wenger also has pleasant memories of the Theatre of Dreams. He lists Sylvain Wiltord’s goal that clinched the title for Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2002 as his favourite. And the Frenchman insists his current crop of players can produce another win in United’s back yard on Monday night.

‘I don’t believe our recent record at Old Trafford (to be a factor). When the team is less good, they lose. When the team is not as good, they lose,’ said Wenger.

‘It doesn’t matter what shirt they wear, or what stadium they play in. It is down to quality.

‘If I’ve learnt something in my life it’s that the performance on the day decides the outcome of the day, not where you play.

‘The fact that we can win away from home, that is important. If you haven’t won away from home all season it’s more difficult. But we know we can do well away from home.’

Indeed, their victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium earlier this season proved they can produce big away performances against England’s elite, and Wenger insists last season’s FA Cup triumph has bolstered belief that his side can become English football’s top dogs once more.

‘Yes, of course we want to dominate again,’ said Wenger.

‘I think today you have more competitors and it will get worse with the seasons coming because you get more money in. That means even the smaller teams will be capable to buy the best players in Europe.

‘Maybe the competition will become harder for everybody. Winning the FA Cup gave us energy because we had a few years without winning a trophy and so on that front it was vital.

‘This team has a good mentality because we had a slow start this season and every time we lost a big game you see how much the players are touched.

‘I think the mentality is very healthy, they want to do well and we will be focused on Manchester United.

‘Once you get to the quarter- final you think that’s a good opportunity to win a trophy. You want to do it, but it’s at that stage where it’s conflicting always with the Champions League.’
