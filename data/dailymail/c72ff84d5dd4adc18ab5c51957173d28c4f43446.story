Murder-suicide dad Josh Powell had a secret fetish, according to documents released today under state public record laws.

Powell, who blew up himself and his two sons Charlie and Braden after being accused of murdering his wife, told Washington social workers he liked to take pictures of strangers' legs in public places.

The files say Powell seemed to understand the laws around taking voyeur pictures and said he didn't take pictures of people's faces.

Fetish: Josh Powell told social workers he liked taking photos of stranger's legs. Up until his death he maintained that he had nothing to do with wife Susan's disappearance

His admission came one day after his father, Stephen Powell, was arrested on voyeurism and child pornography charges.

Police believed the elder Powell may know what happened regarding Susan’s disappearance and searched his home looking for evidence in Susan's disappearance.

They found child pornography and other troubling videos in Steve Powell's bedroom.

Prosecutors said that for at least a decade, he had been secretly filming women, including Susan, and that he shot footage of two young female neighbours as they took baths and sat on the toilet.

He remains jailed on $200,000 bail.

Vanished: Susan Powell disappeared in 2009. Husband Josh Powell was a suspect

Josh Powell was a suspect in the disappearance of Susan Powell from their West Valley City, Utah, home in 2009 but he maintained that he did not know what had happened to her.

He claimed he took his young sons, then four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am, and said he believed his wife ran off with another man.

Weeks later, he moved the boys to the home of his fathe  in Puyallup, Washington.

After Steven Powell's arrest, the boys were removed from the house and turned over to Susan Powell's parents.

Explosion: Josh Powell blew up his house, killing himself and his two sons

Authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where Josh Powell said he went camping that night.

At one point, they said they found a 
'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they 
found no human remains.

In February Powell killed himself and his two sons, Charles and Braden, in a house fire.

A social worker had taken them to his rental home on February 5 for what was supposed to be a court-sanctioned supervised visit.

Devastated: Chuck and Judy Cox spoke out after their two grandsons, Charlie and Braden, were killed

Powell let the boys inside, locked the social worker out, hit them with a hatchet and set fire to gasoline, authorities said.

In the wake of the gas explosion, 
Susan’s parents - Chuck and Judy Cox - spoke out about the revelations 
that their grandchildren had made in the months leading up to the 
explosion.

'Over the Christmas holidays, Chuck (Cox) sent me an email saying something like "Real important- one of the boys says if we go to the mine we will find mommy,"' Ann Bremner, one of the Cox's lawyers who was focusing on the disappearance of Susan, told MailOnline exclusively.

Ms Bremner said that Mr Cox immediately told police about the boy's admission, but nothing was done.
