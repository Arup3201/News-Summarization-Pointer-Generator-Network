Ultramarathon burns victim Turia Pitt has opened up about how her life has changed since the horrifying moment she nearly lost her life and revealed why she hasn't returned to scene of the bushfire that left her with burns to nearly two-thirds of her body.

Pitt, who became trapped in a bushfire while running an outback marathon in Western Australia in 2011, this week won a multi-million-dollar settlement and says she's now finally ready to move on with her partner.

'I don't need to put any pieces together - I know what it was like, I was there,' she told 60 Minutes on Sunday night.

'It's like if you have a nightmare, do you want to have that nightmare again?'

Moving forward: Ms Pitt said she does not need to return to where the ultramarathon fire happened, because she already had closure

Ms Pitt reunited with three other victims of the 2011 bushfire, who she considers close friends, and the rescue team who saved their lives in the Kimberley outback.

The survivors were all competing as one team in a 20-kilometre swim in Lake Argyle, the first time they had all returned to the area since the fire.

While the other three victims returned to the spot in the Western Australia Kimberley Region gorge where they faced the blaze, Ms Pitt said she had already moved on and did not need to see it again.

'They (the other victims) wanted to do that and that's good for them if it helps them move on, but I've already got closure,' she said.

Ms Pitt also revealed how her long-term boyfriend Michael Hoskin has supported her throughout her recovery and into a new chapter of her life.

'There's a lot of positive things that have happened,' Ms Pitt said.

'I think we all have that inner strength inside of us, but we just never get tested, so we never get the chance to discover how incredible we all are.'

Ms Pitt and her boyfriend said they were now enjoying life again, with Mr Hoskin adding they had endured a tough couple of years.

'There's a lot of messages that you can get out of my story and one of them is having a positive relationship with your partner,' Ms Pitt said.

'My relationship with Michael before the fire was on a totally different level, because we were just young, we were boyfriend and girlfriend, we'd just moved in together - life was perfect, seemingly perfect.'

But Ms Pitt said she believed she now shares a deeper connection with her partner.

'I've found out just how strong I really am,' she said.

The 26-year-old has also taken on the role as a motivational speaker sharing her story of survival and also discussing body image as she has recovered.

'I'm incredibly fortunate to have found my partner Michael,' she told a group of school students.

'He loves me exactly how I am.'

Speaking about body image, Ms Pitt said she felt like people had only valued her because she was good looking.

'Not because I'm smart, gritty, determined - we are all so much more than our bodies,' she said.

On being question about her strength and courage, Ms Pitt said she did not consider herself that inspiring.

'I'm just living life to its fullest and that's what everyone should do,' she said.

Ms Pitt has been awarded a multi-million-dollar settlement from event organisers Racing The Planet.

The former model and another runner, Kate Sanderson, suffered burns to more than 60 per cent of their bodies after they became trapped in a bushfire while running an outback marathon in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia in 2011.

The Supreme Court action was settled out of court for a reported $10million.

The MailOnline understands the settlement amount is significantly less.

The rescue team and the survivors shared an emotional reunion three years after the fire

Mr Hoskin said it got settled through mediation and the couple were glad the process was over.

'You can’t really speak about whether it was a good or great outcome, there's no winners, it’s just an outcome you know, but it’s really good to have that behind us now, so we can move forward,' he said.

'We don’t even have to think about that ever again.'

When asked if she felt that she can now let go, Ms Pitt said 'Yeah I think so yeah'.

She added that psychologically it was a good thing.

'Yeah of course it’s a good thing. I mean I can move on.'

With her compensation case settled, Ms Pitt is due undergo further surgery including rebuilding her nose.

But the surgery has been put on hold for a few months, with Ms Pitt and her partner focusing on learning their yachting skills, which they plan to use as they sail around Tahiti.

Ms Pitt launched the court action in February last year after a WA parliamentary inquiry found Hong Kong-based Racing The Planet did not take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of competitors.

Ms Pitt's lawyer Greg Walsh said she had shown enormous courage and dignity.

'I'm very relieved and happy for her and (her boyfriend) Michael (Hoskin) that this matter has now come to an end,' Mr Walsh told the West Australian.

'She will be left with horrific injuries for the rest of her life but at least she won't have to put up with the stress and worry of a protracted court case.'

In 2012 Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, 38, were awarded $450,000 by the WA government as an 'Act of Grace'.

Western Australia Tourism Minister Dr Kim Hames said that the money was to 'assist in alleviating their financial stress while they explore other options.'

Ms Pitt, who was working in mining engineering when she entered the marathon race, told a 2012 inquiry that she wasn't even planning to enter the event because she thought the entry fee was ridiculous.

But two weeks before the marathon on September 2, 2011, she was invited by organisers to compete for free.

She was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast Ms Sanderson and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback Kimberley region of north west Australia.

But part-way through the race Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, along with two male competitors, became trapped by a bushfire in a narrow, rocky gorge.

Ms Pitt's injuries were so bad that not only did she suffer burns to 64 per cent of her body, she also had four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated.

Ms Sanderson had to have her left foot amputated, lost part of her earlobes and part of her right index finger.

They told the inquiry earlier they had no idea they were running into danger because the organisers had spoken only 'in passing' about spot fires.

Ms Pitt said she and Ms Sanderson would have died at the gorge if not for a risky rescue mission undertaken by a helicopter crew.
