Hikers risk death or serious injury when they climb the world's most dangerous trail, Mount Hua near the city of Huayin in China.

The picturesque views are extraordinary but every hiker has to endure stomach-churning drops and dangerously narrow paths along the way. 

A one-foot wide plank is the only security measure for brave climbers who brave the  2,154-meter tall mountain. 

Drop: Hikers have to endure stomach-churning drops on Mount Hua near the city of Huayin in China

Hiker Eric Tesch uploaded the terrifying point-of view footage of his climb on YouTube.

Under the video he comments that 'harnesses act as a safety barrier and keep you attached to the mountain face at all times'. 

The American  sticks his leg over the edge on a number of occasions and as he stands on the steep steps which were carved into the rock with chains for support.

Mr Tesch then says, 'Here are some good steps here.'

During the video Mr Tesch appears to be very calm despite the incredible height and the impending danger posed by the dangerous trail.

'I don't know why but this is not scary at all,' Mr Tesch says, 'I think it's because we're connected.'

As Mr Tesch looks down at the harrowing drop he says, 'This is kinda weird. Yeah this is, this is incredible.'

Joker: Mr Tesch even jokes around as he walks along the narrow meandering trail

The walkways up Mount Hua consist of steep meandering staircases, unforgiving ascents and a notorious wooden plank trail which is fastened onto the mountainside.

In recent years some of the paths and routes up along the mountain have been improved as visitor numbers to the popular Chinese tourist attraction have increased.

However, the hike is still widely regarded as one of the most dangerous hiking trails in the world.

There are no official statistics on deaths on Mount Hua but it has been estimated that the mountain claims the lives of about 100 lives every year. 

The most dangerous section of the Mount Hua trail is the Changong Zhandao, a narrow plank path

Colorfully described as the 'plankwalk in the sky' the visitors to Mount Hua are primarily regarded as young adrenaline-fuelled daredevils.

The most dangerous section of the Mount Hua trail is the Changong Zhandao, which is a perilously narrow (13 by one foot long) plank path which meanders around a vertical cliff.

The safety measures at Changong Zhandao are at best described as precarious.

Climbers are encouraged to bring their own harness equipment as there is no safety rail or chain for hikers to securely attach themselves.

During the second century Mount Hua was a notable religious centre as the renowned Daoist temple was being constructed and despite the risk, climbers continue to visit the site in large numbers.
