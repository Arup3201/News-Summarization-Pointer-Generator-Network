An architect's plan to shoot-up the upscale New York design firm where he worked 'because he was getting fired' was halted by a fellow employee who says she saw him make a map of potential victims and heard him make threats.

Kon Jang, 35, was arrested on May 29 after he allegedly schemed to shoot employees at the CentraRuddy design firm in Soho after they planned to fire him for his mercurial temperament and 'erratic' behavior.

Jang, described as a 'loner', failed to keep his plan secret to a female employee deemed 'his only friend' at the firm.

Kon Jang, 35, allegedly planned to shoot his coworkers at the upscale New York design firm that was going to fire him for his 'erratic' behavior

He allegedly told her that he had a gun and that he planned to execute a mass shooting at the office.

He showed her a map that had red 'Xs' where his co-workers sat. On her desk and his he apparently put a circle.

The Post reports that Jang also told coworkers, 'I’m going to come back here and you are going to get it.'

He allegedly told his one female confidant that he 'wanted to be on the news' and that he was planning a 'tragedy.'

He also allegedly told the woman that he was going to warn her not to come to work the day of the shooting.

The woman says he probed her for information about when the next meeting would be 'where everyone would be together.'

The design firm CentraRuddy is located on Broadway in the upscale neighborhood of Soho in Manhattan

He reportedly said he'd 'stay quiet until then.'

When police went to Jang's home in Wood-Ridge, NJ on May 29 they arrested him on harassment charges and say that they found 'what appears to be an assault rifle and rounds of fake ammunition.'

It's unclear as to whether or not he knew his ammunition was fake.

Jang is being held on $10,000 bail. He surrendered his passport on May 30 and his next court apperance is on June 16.

'He was very quiet. I never saw anything, I never would have guessed,' said a woman who works at CetraRuddy to the post.

Jang is 'no longer with the firm,' said another employee. 

According to his LinkedIn profile, Jang had been employed by CentraRuddy since February of last year.

He studied at prestigious universities like University of The Arts London, Pratt, and The Rhode Island School of Design.

His design website Konidesign.com shows projects he worked on in New York, Boston, Portland, and Providence.
