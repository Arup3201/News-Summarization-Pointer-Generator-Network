News of the royal birth brought Twitter close to meltdown yesterday as millions from around the world shared their excitement and offered congratulations.

Before the baby’s birth was even announced, an incredible 487million Twitter users had viewed posts about the Duchess of Cambridge going into labour on what is thought to be one of the busiest days the social network had ever experienced.

By 8pm yesterday, more than 500,000 tweets were sent mentioning the royal baby, according to social media monitoring firm Netbase – and after the birth was announced at 8.29pm, the number rocketed higher by the second.

But just 41 per cent of the posts 
came from the UK. The US accounted for 29 per cent, followed by Canada 
and Australia, and two-thirds were made by women.

In a break with tradition, the news of the labour and the birth were also officially announced on Twitter.

A tweet from Clarence House yesterday morning read: ‘Her Royal Highness 
The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital, 
Paddington, London, in the early stages of labour.’ The message was 
retweeted, or shared, among users nearly 7,000 times.

Later, as the paper bulletin was posted on an easel confirming the 
baby’s birth, a further post read: ‘Her Royal Highness The Duchess of 
Cambridge was safely delivered of a son at 4.24pm.’ This was retweeted 
more than 13,000 times, and marked the first time the traditional 
announcement of a royal birth has been paired with a release through 
social media.

Photographer Jesal Parshotam, 24, alerted the world to the impending arrival of the royal baby when he spotted the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William go into the hospital just before 6am yesterday.

An all-night stint watching the back entrance had ended in success and he broke the news via Twitter.

London-based Mr Parshotam said: ‘I guess it’s the biggest scoop of my career’.

However, he chose not to take any pictures of the couple, claiming it was out of respect. Either that or he left his lens cap on.

Within hours of the Palace’s announcement that the Duchess had gone into
labour, the term ‘#royalbaby’ had become the most popular topic on the 
UK site, while the words ‘Kate Middleton’ were a top discussion in the 
US.

At least seven topics relating to the royal baby jumped to the top of 
the ‘trending’ list, and among the most popular was speculation over the
baby’s name.

And as soon as the birth was announced last night, celebrities and 
politicians rushed to tweet their messages of congratulations to the 
Duke and Duchess.

From model Cara Delevingne and singer Cheryl Cole to 
Olympic diver Tom Daley and Mayor of London Boris Johnson, the good 
wishes came thick and fast.

Prime Minister David Cameron wrote: ‘I’m delighted for the  Duke and 
Duchess now their son has been born. The whole country will celebrate. 
They’ll make wonderful parents.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg wrote: ‘Congratulations to The Duke and
Duchess of Cambridge. Good news to make the whole country smile.’

The Archbishop of York John Sentamu wrote: ‘Congratulations to the Duke 
and Duchess of  Cambridge. The joy and hope  of the Royal baby boy is a 
great gift of God.’

As the birth was announced, Stephen Fry wrote: ‘The official easel. We 
really are a marvellously bonkers country.’ Earlier, noticing that the 
word ‘labour’ was trending on the website, he wrote: ‘Labour has never 
been so popular’ – adding: ‘My guess is that it will be a baby.’

Piers Morgan also joined the labour discussions, guessing: ‘PREDICTION: A boy, called George, weighing 8lbs 2oz #MysticMorgan’

The Mumsnet discussion forum was also dominated by news of the baby. 
More than 700 messages were posted within hours yesterday on the single 
thread ‘Kate’s in labour: royal baby on way’. 

The website of the Left-wing Guardian newspaper was dominated by news of the royal baby yesterday – but offered republican readers a chance to avoid ‘royalist’ news.

Those clicking on the ‘Republican’ option had a picture of a smiling Kate replaced by one of pop singer Morrissey.

Guardian Live blogger Peter Walker informed his handful of readers: ‘I’m a republican’, lamely adding: ‘But I nonetheless, of course, wish all concerned the very best.’

Users were quick to advise and sympathise with every stage of the 
process, with one posting: ‘I feel sorry for her. I really did not want 
anyone except my mum and [husband] to know I was in labour and just 
wanted to get on with it.

‘It must be awful to think that the world is all imagining her huffing and puffing.’

The royal baby will have a punt named after him in Cambridge.

The 22ft wooden boat is being refurbished and will have the child’s royal title carved on each side.

Sam Matthews, of its owners The  Cambridge Punting Company, said: ‘We are proud to say that it will be the first water-going vessel to bear the name of the royal baby.

‘They can take it out any time – obviously with parental supervision.’

Elsewhere on the internet, the baby had his own Wikipedia page before he
was even born. Entitled ‘Royal Baby: Child of the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge’, the entry had been viewed more than 95,000 times. A number 
of spoof Twitter accounts also sprung up under the name ‘Royal Baby’ or 
‘Baby Cambridge’.
