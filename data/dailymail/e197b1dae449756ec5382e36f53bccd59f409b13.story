Cash-strapped families have cut their energy use since 2005 as bills have soared.

A combination of increased charges and wages flatlining have forced households to turn their heating off to cut costs.

New figures also reveal wide variations in the amount of energy people use in different parts of the country, with people in the East Midlands using almost double that of homes in the South West.

Energy bills: New figures show how the amount of energy households use has fallen by 25 per cent since 2005

The average home usage in England and Wales fell by 24.7% over the period to 2011, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Consumer groups said that while energy savings measures may have played apart, the big drop will have been caused by people simply switching off their heating altogether.

A study this month found people struggling with energy bills face a gap of £438 between their bills and what they can afford to pay – an increase of almost £200 over the last decade.

The gap means those in fuel poverty in England alone face bills totalling £1.05billion more than they can afford – a jump from £606million in 2003.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which? said: ‘Energy efficiency measures may have played a part in the fall in energy usage but the fact is many consumers will have cut back in order to save money in the face of spiraling prices and squeezed incomes. 

‘Consistently four in ten have told us that they plan to cut back on future spending on their energy bills.’

He called for the government to do more to help people cope with the rising cost of energy bills. 

‘People will not feel confident that they are getting a fair deal unless prices are simplified and the costs that make up our energy bills are open, transparent and subject to robust scrutiny.’

The highest regional consumption levels - which were adjusted to take into account the variations in weather - were in the East Midlands, the data showed.

It appeared that regions with the highest level of Economy 7 consumption of night-time cheap electricity use more energy overall.

In England and Wales overall, average household energy consumption was 19.7 megawatt hours (mWh) per household in 2011

Across England and Wales, average household energy consumption fell from 26.2 megawatt hours (mWh) in 2005 to 19.7mWh in 2011.

Improvements such as better loft and cavity wall insulation as well as more efficient boilers may be among the reasons for the decrease, the ONS said.

Another could be the introduction of energy rating scales for properties and household appliances, allowing consumers to make informed choices about purchases, it added.

There has also been ‘increasing public awareness of energy consumption and environmental issues’ while at the same time the price of gas and electricity across the UK has been rising.

The average household energy consumption in the East Midlands in 2011 was 27.5 mWh, well above the national average, while the South West had the lowest, at 16.1 mWh.

Worries: Consumer groups said households were forced to cut their energy use to cope with rising bills

A breakdown of local authorities showed that those consuming less energy tended to be in more rural areas, with a higher proportion of households without piped gas and therefore possibly using other sources of energy.

Of the 10 authorities with the lowest consumption - topped by the Isles of Scilly - eight included rural parts of Wales and the South West, although two were in the capital - the City of London and Tower Hamlets.

The ONS said that areas that consumed more household energy tended to have higher levels of net income after taking account of housing costs.

All the top 10 areas for consumption were in the East Midlands - a region that had the second highest level of Economy 7 use as a proportion of all energy.

‘It could be that households which receive some electricity at a cheaper rate may use more energy overall because it is cheaper,’ the ONS said.

Industry body Energy UK said: ‘This fall in consumption shows how effective it is to insulate your home. Britain's homes are notoriously leaky and energy companies have been busy improving properties to make them warmer and easier to heat.

‘They have installed insulation and other measures in millions of homes across the country over the past few years.’
