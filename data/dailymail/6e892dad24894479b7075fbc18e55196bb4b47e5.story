A Celine Dion fan who made his neighbours' lives a misery by blasting out My Heart Will Go On has had his iPod and speakers taken away, it was revealed today.

Gareth Davies, 47, of Strood, Kent, was targeted by council officers after locals complained he was blaring out tunes including the classic ballad from the 1997 film Titanic at top volume.

After he breached a noise order six times, council officers with a warrant seized thousands of pounds worth of equipment from the former window salesman’s home.

They included his 3D TV, a laptop, speakers, a sound docking station with iPod, 32 DVDs, CDs and a PlayStation 3. Officers had witnessed music being played in the afternoon and early evening.

Other songs on his playlist included James Brown's Sex Machine, Apache Indian's Boom Shack-A-Lak, Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild and You've Got A Friend In Me from the 1995 film Toy Story.

The equipment is now in storage and after 28 days Mr Davies, who has been living in the £80,000 Victorian terraced house since 1988, can apply for its return.

He said: ‘I don't understand why the council have changed their policy on this issue. That's why I ignored the notice - I thought I'd get the chance to defend myself.’

Mr Davies added that it was a horrible experience and estimated the council had removed £3,000 of equipment.

He said the council also tried to take his iPhone and his MacBook because they were removing anything that could make sounds.

‘It felt like it was a witch hunt. There's all sorts of things that make sounds - this is ridiculous.’

Medway Council will also now consider prosecuting the man under the Environmental Protection Act and magistrates could decide to destroy the equipment in the future.

Cllr Peter Hicks, Medway Council's Portfolio Holder for Community Safety, said: ‘It only takes one complaint, as in this case, and we will act.

'People have the right to lead a peaceful existence without it being ruined by loud music.

‘We won't tolerate this sort of behaviour and anyone who blasts out music or creates other noise nuisance should let this be a warning to them.’
