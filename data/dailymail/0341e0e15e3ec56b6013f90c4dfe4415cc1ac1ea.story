With its riverbank setting in the upmarket Buckinghamshire village of Bourne End, this Victorian house could hardly have a more peaceful location. 

But its history tells a different story – of revolutionary social change and financial despair.

Platts Dell, whose garden the meandering River Thames sleepily caresses, is where the formative years of frontline suffragette Kate Parry Frye were spent. 

It was here that her father, Frederick Frye, a businessman and Liberal politician, saw his firm collapse, resulting in his family having to auction the house that they had lived in for 22 years, as well as its contents.

The four-bedroom Victorian house where suffragette Kate Parry Frye lived is  on the market for £945,000

The details of her family's travails – and Kate's conversion into a leading light of the suffragette movement – are documented in her diaries, which she kept from the age of eight until three months before her death at 81 in 1959. 

The diaries were discovered in 2013 and edited into a book, Campaigning For The Vote by historian Elizabeth Crawford. 

They tell of how she joined the suffragettes in 1906, how she criss-crossed southern England and set up camp in the East End of London on her mission to win for 'Votes for Women', and how she helped see through the suffragettes' partial victory in 1918 – when women were allowed to vote from the age of 30 – and the full victory in 1928, when the age limit was lowered to 21, the same as for men.

And last year, marking the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War, ITV told how women's fortunes changed during the war through Kate's eyes, in the series The Great War: The People's Story – with Romola Garai playing the suffragette.

'We weren't aware when we bought the property that a famous suffragette lived here until we read the history of the house in our local library,' says John Fleming, who moved into Platts Dell with his wife Chris in 1992. 'Since then we have enjoyed researching the history of Kate and the suffragettes.'

Price: £945,000

Location: Bourne End, Buckinghamshire

Bedrooms: Four

Unique features: Private riverside garden with 39ft mooring, turret, former home of suffragette Kate Parry Frye  

For most of Kate's formative years, her parents were well-to-do. Her mother was a member of the Gilbey family, who had a wine and spirits empire, and her father was a successful businessman and, for three years, an MP.

Although not needing to work, Kate wanted a career in the theatre. She trained as an actress and went on tour with a rep company. When the play wasn't a success she returned to the family home. 

She joined the suffragettes and founded the Bourne End and District Suffrage Society, later taking a paid job as organiser of the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage. John and Chris live in one half of the house, which was divided into two in 1989. The property has a private mooring on the Thames and is on a private no-through road.

The village centre, with its train station, is only a few hundred yards away. 'We loved the house from the moment we saw it,' says John, who works as a finance director for a financial services company. 'Chris and I love sitting out and watching the boats go by.'

Platts Dell, which has four bedrooms, is laid out over three floors and has a circular turret, and large bay windows in the living room and dining room with views over the front garden. From most of the upper floors in the house there are views of the river.

The Flemings, who have three children and five grandchildren, are selling, for £945,000, because the other half of the house has become free. 

'It became available when our neighbour passed away – we've always had our eye on it,' says John.
