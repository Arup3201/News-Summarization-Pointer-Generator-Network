A husband has revealed how caring for his wife of 76 years through a long battle with Alzheimer's disease took a severe toll on his physical and emotional well-being.

Reggie Gooch, 98, got up at 4am every morning for two years to make his beloved wife Millie breakfast - then stayed by her side until 10pm each night. 

Mrs Gooch died at the couple's home in Hollywood, California last month, leaving her husband suffering from compassion fatigue -  a condition with a variety of symptoms of secondary post-traumatic stress caused by caregiving.

Mr Gooch, who worked as a carpenter while his wife worked in real estate, told Good Morning America: 'The furthest I could get away would be the entrance hall to pick up the mail. I don't think I could have gone on much longer.'

Although he had help from a part-time caregiver, Mr Gooch admitted that the strain of watching over his wife had a severe effect on his health.

Before his wife fell ill, Mr and Mrs Gooch loved to garden and spend time with friends. In their younger years, they had traveled the world together. 

The Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project has been established to help caregivers who find themselves in position where they have to provide intense support for loved ones without any previous training.

According to the organisation, when an individual focuses so intensely on another's needs to the detriment of their own it can result in apathy, isolation, bottled up emotions and substance abuse, along with many other symptoms associated with a secondary traumatic stress disorder.

Around 65 million Americans care for someone who is 
chronically ill or disabled for around 20 hours a week, according to the National Alliance for 
Caregiving.

More than 15 million Americans provide unpaid care -  valued at $210 billion -  for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. 

The aim of the Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project is to support and educate caregivers, helping them find out where they can get help - and how to ask for it. 

Adventure: The Goochs loved to travel and socialise with friends until Mille was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and the couple became almost housebound

Mr Gooch, who is about to turn 99, has managed to regain small pleasures in life following his wife's death - essential for those who suffer from compassion fatigue. However he said that he misses Millie every day.

He told ABC: 'We were always love birds... We always took care of one another.'
