An American man who served in Iraq but later deserted because he believed the conflict breached international law, could win the right to claim asylum in the European Union, according to the bloc's top court. 

The European Court of Justice is to rule on the opinion in the coming months. If confirmed, it could increase asylum claim rights to non-EU citizens who face a court-martial or other punishments at home for refusing military service.  

André Lawrence Shepherd, 37, from Ohio, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2003 and was deployed to Iraq in 2004, where he maintained Apache helicopters.

André Lawrence Shepherd is fighting to gain asylum in the EU after deserting the U.S military when he refused to return to Iraq in 2007; a leading advocate says he could win his case 

Shepherd was deployed to Iraq in 2004 to maintain Apache helicopters, as seen above; he re-enlisted in 2005 but later decided the war was illegal and deserted rather than following an order to return there in 2007

He re-enlisted in 2005, but later decided the war was illegal and failed to go to Iraq when ordered to do so in 2007.

Mr Shepherd, who was based in Germany, unsuccessfully sought asylum there, then later appealed the decision.

Before reaching a decision, a German court sought clarifications on several points of EU asylum law from the European Court of Justice. When they receive those opinions, the court will then decide on Mr Shepherd's case. 

An opinion on the case by Advocate General Eleanor V.E. Sharpston yesterday isn't binding on the European Court of Justice, but the court generally follows such recommendations, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

However, she said it was up to the German court to examine the case and decide whether the punishment Mr Shepherd would face if convicted, would act as an act or persecution. The European court didn't have enough evidence to rule on that, the advocate general said.

Another central question in EU asylum law was whether there was a reasonable likelihood the person deployed to a war zone would be involved in war crimes, her opinion said. The German court would also need to answer that.

Sherpherd's lawyer said his client only agreed to re-enlist after being told he wouldn't be sent back to Iraq

Mrs Sharpston said: 'What matters is the likelihood that the applicant risks committing war crimes. It is not necessary to establish beyond reasonable doubt that violations of international criminal law can be expected to occur,' she said.

Even though Mr Shepherd was in a noncombat role, she said the right to claim asylum because of war crimes should apply to him. 

She said it wasn't relevant in this case that Mr. Shepherd didn't apply for conscientious objection to U.S. authorities because that wouldn't have stopped his redeployment.

The European Court of Justice usually takes three to six months to make a final ruling. 

Mr Shepherd's lawyer, Reinhard Marx, said the opinion backed the arguments he was already making.

He said client, currently living in Davaria, could face up to 18 months jail in the U.S for desertion and had only agreed to re-enlist after being told his unit wouldn't be sent back to Iraq. 

The case is the first dealing with an asylum request for a U.S military employee in the EU, Mr Marx said.    

Rates of desertion in the U.S.increased significantly during the Iraq war. In 2007 nine in every 1,000 soldiers deserted during that financial year. The rates, however, were significantly higher during the Vietnam War.
