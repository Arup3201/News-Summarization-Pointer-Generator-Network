A Fashion Police insider has claimed that Kathy Griffin was about to be fired from the show before her unexpected Twitter resignation.

In yet another twist to the saga, TMZ has claimed that producers had met and discussed booting her from the show.

According to the report, a pitch meeting took a sour turn when somebody suggested a new segment called 'Whore Score', but Griffin shot it down for being too mean, claiming 'Name calling and alliteration with no comedic context is simply the lowest hanging fruit'.

Jumped or pushed?: A Fashion Police insider has reportedly claimed Kathy Griffin was about to be fired from the show when she suddenly announced she was quitting on Twitter

She then went on a rant blasting the show as 'old school and tired' which infuriated production staff, who felt she was being hypocritical as her comedy routines have always been exactly what she was complaining about.

However Griffin denied she was facing the axe, claiming the show's producers kept promising her she could host in her own comedy style but continuously reneging and forcing her to do the same old fare. 

The 54-year-old comedienne announced abruptly on Thursday with a lengthy Twitter message that she was abandoning the post she had filled following the death of legendary host Joan Rivers in September.

Rally: The 54-year-old sent an email out to her celebrity friends asking them to support her decision publicly 

'After seven episodes of Fashion Police, I discovered that my style does not fit with the creative direction of the show and now it’s time to move on,' Kathy wrote, claiming that while she was happy to playfully tease people about their clothes, she did not want to 'contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference'.

It emerged on Friday that just after she jumped ship, Griffin emailed a number of her celebrity friends asking them to take to Twitter and make a public show of supporting her decision.

The email, obtained by Buzzfeed, was subjected 'Here's why I need you...' was sent to a list of undisclosed recipients. 

Low hanging fruit: Critics have pointed out the comedienne has never been shy about laughing at other people's physicalities  

What she said: Griffin wrote a lengthy letter explaining her decision

'I went live with the following statement on my social media platforms this evening. I’m reaching out to you because I think you will understand why I have made this decision and I am asking for your support via Twitter, etc. IF you are comfortable,' she wrote

'I admire you & your work and hope that you can stand by me. Once again, IF you are comfortable. Oh, and I am nervous and scared about this…in case you’re wondering :wink:' before signing off Thanks! XXOO, Kathy Griffin'.

A host of celebrities, including Kelly Osbourne and Lena Dunham, immediately took to Twitter to applaud her departure after just seven episodes.

Kelly, who herself walked away from the show just days before Kathy, was among the first to commend her decision.

'I could not be more proud of you @kathygriffin you have my love and support always!' she wrote on Instagram, along with a TMI picture of the former co-hosts licking each other's tongues.

Whether she as asked to or not, Lena Dunham also took to Instagram to praise Kathy's stand: 'Congrats to my beautiful friend Kathy Griffin for bravely saying enough is enough to intolerance of all kinds on television,' she wrote beneath a flashback photo of the comedienne wearing a pair of Minnie Mouse ears. 'She's modeling a better way for the youths (and working those ears).'

Actress Kristen Chenoweth Tweeted the star directly, saying: '@kathygriffin Gurl. I read your statement. Thanks for being WHO YOU ARE. Can't wait to work together on your chapter? You're every woman.'

Fellow TV host Chelsea Handler, who walked away from her own show last year, wrote: '@kathygriffin way to go girl. Stick to your guns. Onwards and sideways. Lub you.'

All ears: Lena Dunham posted a flashback shot of Griffin who 'bravely saying enough is enough to intolerance of all kinds on television'

Among Kathy's other many supporters were chat show host Wendy Williams, who posted: 'I adore YOU and all YOU do!! xox'; while actress Alexandra Wentworth told her 'You go funny lady'; and Rosie O'Donnell simply said 'Proud of U!!!'

Comedian Billy Eichner saw the funny side, tweeting: 'I love Kathy and I've seen every episode of Fashion Police but somewhere Joan Rivers is cackling', before following it up with: 'THOU SHALL NEVER CROSS THE ALMIGHTY ZENDAYA AND LIVE TO TELL THE TALE! #FashionPolice.'

Fellow comedienne Margaret Cho meanwhile saw it as an opportunity to throw her own hat in the ring, calling for a new version of the show called Fashion Police: Special Victims Unit.

Support: Rosie O'Donnell said she was proud of Kathy's decision

'I actually make clothes @e_FashionPolice #StraightOuttaTheSweatshopAndIntoYourHeart so you should have me host x,' she joked.

Not everybody was impressed with Kathy's decision, however. Mail Online Editor At Large Piers Morgan Tweeted: 'Kathy Griffin's quit Fashion Police because she doesn't like their mean humour? Ironically, one of the few times she's ever made me laugh. 

'This is the same Kathy Griffin whose whole career has been predicated on b****ing about people and being mean, right? #HypocritePolice,' he added.

Indeed, Washington Post style blogger Stephanie Merry pointed out that Griffin has never been opposed to cruelly making fun of celebrities' physical appearances before, compiling an extensive list of the comedienne's stand-up routines in which she makes much more pointed barbs than anything that would be uttered on Fashion Police.

Kathy's exit comes after her co-host Kelly left the celebrity couture hits and misses series following controversy stemming from Giuliana Rancic's comments about Zendaya's hair during The Oscars on February 22. 

The exodus leaves two open spots alongside Giuliana and Brad Goreski on Fashion Police.

Several names were suggested when Kelly announced her departure, but there have been no confirmations as of yet.

Those named include reality star Khloe Kardashian, Real Housewives Of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes, Glee actress/singer Naya Rivera, model Chrissy Teigen, and hip-hop model Amber Rose.

Anyone else? The exodus leaves just Giuliana Rancic, whose comment started the whole furor, and Brad Goreski as hosts

Controversial comment: Giuliana said Zendaya looked as though her hair would smell of 'weed' on the Oscars red carpet
