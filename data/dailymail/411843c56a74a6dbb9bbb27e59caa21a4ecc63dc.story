Dorothy Daly spent £15,000 and four years investigating her son's death in Greece eventually proving the negligence of the lorry driver who killed him

A mother who refused to accept the lies of a Greek lorry driver who killed her son on holiday has finally seen him jailed after a four-year campaign for justice.

Stefanis Konstantinos claimed Glen Daly lost control of his moped and slid under the wheels of his truck in Crete in June 2009.

Greek police believed him and said the death of 24 year-old Glen, who was on holiday with best friend Tony Atkins, was an accident.

But Glen's mother Dorothy, 55, turned detective and unravelled a web of lies that her son's killers had woven.

Her quest for the truth began after Mr Atkins, 28, told her how the lorry had dangerously pulled in front of them.

Konstantinos, 46, then leapt from his cab to clear Glen's bike out of the way before driving off without calling for help.

Determined Dorothy, a mother-of-three, begged the British and Greek authorities to re-open the case but says she was simply abandoned.

She launched her own investigation - which cost her £15,000 - from her kitchen in Grays, Essex.

She began with a staggering 500 phone calls and appeals in the Greek press to track down the doctor who helped her son at the scene.

Konstantinos had told police the medic was foreign - but Dorothy proved his first lie by discovering that she was Greek.

She then took the decision to re-examine her son's dead body herself and saw that he had no scratches or injuries apart from the head injury that killed him.

That showed that Glen - himself a lorry driver - had been killed in a head-on crash, and not by sliding off his moped.

Konsantinos was discredited further still
when Dorothy found he had lied with local shopkeeper Georgios Tsolakaki
to cover his tracks.

Tsolakaki had told police he had no idea who had delivered ice-cream to him 15 minutes before the crash - but delivery records showed Konsantinos's name.

Dorothy, who also has one grandchild, eventually amassed a dossier detailing 24 flaws in the killer driver's account and persuaded Greek prosecutors to reopened the case.

And last month Konsantinos was finally
convicted of negligent homicide and fleeing the scene of the crash and 
jailed for 23 months in prison.

Dorothy, a full-time carer, said her family would now be able to grieve for the first time.

She said: 'It makes me feel sick to 
think that the driver got out of his van and instead of helping Glen 
just moved the bike and drove off.

Mrs Daly was desperate to prove that Konsantinos was responsible for her son Glen's (pictured) death - and even examined his body to prove her theory

'He should have called the ambulance and police. But instead he removed evidence to try and protect himself.

'I promised Glen that day that I would not let it get swept under the carpet.

We never wanted compensation we just want justice for our son.

'I was desperately trying to get someone 
to help me or take an interest in the case, but I kept getting the door 
shut in my face.

'Every time I found something out it was like getting another piece of the jigsaw.

'I don't know how I did it at the beginning - I was just running on adrenaline. I couldn't really take in what had happened.

'Every time I thought I could not go on it was like Glen was there spurring me on.

'People expect you to move on after four years, but we are stuck in the day it happened as - until now - we had no resolution.

'We have not had any time to grieve properly so now hopefully the process will start.'

Dorothy has now asked the Essex coroner to change the verdict in Glen's inquest from a narrative verdict of a road traffic collision to unlawful killing.
