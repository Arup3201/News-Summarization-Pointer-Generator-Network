Boris Johnson has insisted he is a more serious politician than when he was last in the Commons – but admitted can still ‘drink an awful lot at lunch’ and work effectively. 

The London Mayor, poised to return to Westminster at the next election as David Cameron’s chief rival, rejected charges that he was ‘flakey’ as a Conservative frontbench spokesman – suggesting he was overshadowed by Tony Blair.

‘I don’t want to sound too defensive about it, but this is complete nonsense,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘We were in opposition when Blair was absolutely at the height of his game. I did have a variety of shadow ministerial posts, and one of them at least, I think, I did pretty well.’

But in an apparent attempt to burnish his credentials for high office, he went on: ‘I think probably it’s true that I have changed as a politician, yes.

The experience of running London for six or seven years has shown me what you have to do to get things done, and the energy and the application you have to put into it.’

Mr Johnson, in a wide-ranging interview published today in the Radio Times, repeated his insistence that his several extra-marital affairs would make no difference if he wanted to be prime minister.

‘I fought two quite heavy-duty elections, which had quite a bit of national scrutiny, and I genuinely think that what people are interested in is how you are going to build more homes in London, fight crime, bridge the gap between rich and poor.

'Do you have a vision for society? Those things are a million times more important,’ he said.

Mr Johnson admitted an ‘infantile desire for praise and admiration’ and talks of his admiration for Winston Churchill, the subject of a new biography by the Mayor.

He conceded that in writing the book, he was inviting critics to point out the ‘superficial, absurd points of comparison that this buffoon wants us to draw out’ between him and Churchill.

Mr Johnson expressed awe at Churchill’s ability to drink whisky from breakfast onwards, work all day in high office, enjoy a hearty dinner with claret and cognac, then at 10pm sit down to knock off 2,000 words of his latest book.

‘I mean, what was he on? How did he do it? He was incredible. I was trying to think of somebody in our profession that could do that still… I mean, I can drink an awful lot at lunch and then write very fluently and fast. But if I drink at dinner, it just peters off,’ he added.

The Mayor claimed the wartime prime minister would have shunned Ukip, had he been alive.

‘I think he would have been a Tory, by today’s standards. I don’t think he would have been a Ukip man because he had a more generous conception of what it should all be about,’ he said.

‘If you read his European stuff, he’s pretty much all over the place but there is a consistency; he wants Britain to be involved.

He would have wanted a renegotiation and I dare say a referendum too. All these, of course, are pretty idle speculations.’
