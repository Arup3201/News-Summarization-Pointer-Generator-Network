A mother-of-three has been jailed for refusing to leave the family's makeshift campsite at a 'millionaires' row' in leafy Essex.

Gwen Pryke, 48, was arrested by police yesterday and is expected to serve two months of a four-month sentence for ignoring a court order to vacate the site.

Her husband Asa Pryke, 47, was jailed in November and has since been freed.

The couple were not jailed together because they have three children, Nicholas, 17, Rohan, 15 and Jody, 13,

The couple are living in caravans and tents on a two-acre site at Dedham, Essex, the backdrop of many Constable paintings.

They have been locked in a bitter legal row with Colchester Council since their day nursery business failed, they lost their home in Wormingford, Essex, and they set up camp in July 2011.

Mrs Pryke grew up in the village and although she 'owns' the land, they did not have planning permission to set up camp there.

Despite the jail terms they still refuse to move on or accept council housing offers.

Mr Pryke said: 'They came and dragged her away. It would be wrong to say it was unexpected but it was still a surprise.

'One
of the boys got upset and tried to stop them and had to be restrained. 
The council says we don't own the land but we have been to see a 
solicitor who says we do.

'We know some people think we are stupid 
for standing our ground and digging our heels in but we never thought it
would come to us having our liberty taken away.

Resident in Dedham expressed surprise as police descended yesterday morning.

The Pryke family have set up on land 
behind a sub station down a footpath, which has since been blocked off 
to traffic after they moved onto the site.

Police swooped to arrest Gwen Pryke, 48, as neighbours looked on.

One, who asked not to be named, said: 'Obviously we all know about it and I understand they have been there a long time now.

'He has been objectionable at times but it hasn't really affected me but it has been bad for those who back onto it.

'I have tried not to get involved but you have got to go with the system we have and can't just do what you want.

'I don't like them being there and you can't just do what you want.'

Other neighbours, who also didn't want to be identified, said the family had not caused them any difficulty.

'We kept thinking our country wouldn't treat us like this for trying to have a home for our family on the land.'

He said Mrs Pryke will find it difficult in prison but they are determined to stand their ground and she will get through it.

The family wanted to build a home on the land, which they claim was left to Mrs Pryke by her father, but planning permission was refused.

Mr Pryke said: 'We did push it but now I can't believe it has come to this and we are going to stand our ground. We don't want to be more of the hidden homeless.'

They stayed on the land anyway. A bankruptcy order has led to a dispute between whether an insolvency company or the family own the land.

Tim Young, councillor responsible for housing, defended the council's position.

He said: 'She is spending time in prison not because of a planning dispute but because she is in contempt of court.

'It was a decision of the court to send her to prison not Colchester Council. Or course it is sad it has come to this but they have refused numerous housing offers.

'I am absolutely staggered they would let it have gone this far and I wish they had taken some of the many attempts to give them advice.'
