The lawyer representing a Michigan man accused of killing a driver in an apparent road rage incident revealed this week she is planning to mount a defense based on the state's controversial 'stand your ground' law.

Martin Zale, 69, has been charged with an open count of murder for shooting Derek Flemming, 43, in the head September 2 in Livingston County's Genoa Township. 

Zale's attorney, Melissa Pearce, said she will argue self-defense when the case goes to trial.

Speaking Tuesday outside Howell District Court, Pearce said ‘the whole story has not been told.’ The next court hearing is scheduled for October 7.

Pearce expressed confidence that upon hearing all the evidence in the case, the jury will exonerate her client, CBS Detroit reported. 

Police said Zale confronted Flemming at a stoplight and shot him once in the face from a handgun as his wife, Amy, watched from their car just a few feet away. The victim was unarmed.

According to state Sen Rick Jones, a Republican from Lansing Township who drafted Michigan's ‘stand your ground law,’ the legislation applies only to cases of imminent death, great bodily harm or sexual assault.

From the standpoint of the prosecution, Zale’s shooting of the unarmed father of two cannot be classified as self-defense. 

Amy Flemming's lawyer, William Moore, said the family was considering a civil suit against Zale.

On September 2, Derek and Amy Flemming had just had lunch together and were driving along Grand River Avenue to pick up their children after the first day back at school Tuesday when they ran into Zale in his 2012 Dodge pickup.

Minutes later, Derek Flemming was shot in the head by Zale, police saidy.

A representative for the Flemming family, attorney William Moore, said Zale was 'screaming down a side street' so fast that Amy Flemming believed he was going to hit their 2014 Ford Escape.

He told the the Detroit Free Press that Zale then tailgated the couple, then as they tried to pull to the right to let him pass, he passed them in the right lane, forcing them to jerk back into the left. Amy Flemming told Moore that Zale then pulled in front of the couple and slammed on his brakes. 

When both cars pulled up at a set of traffic lights on Grand River at Chilson, Derek Flemming got out of his vehicle and approached Zale's window.

A loud argument ensued, witnesses told WXYZ, but it doesn't appear there was any physical contact between the men.

Zale then lowered his window and shot Flemming once in the face.

'His wife was forced to witness this act from the front seat of her car,' Moore said in a statement on behalf of the family.

Speaking to Detroit Free Press, the victim's widow recalled how Zale appeared emotionless after gunning down her husband.

'Shock and extreme grief': Amy Flemming witnessed her husband's shooting as the couple went to pick up their children from the first day back at school

'He was just sitting in his truck and when I was kneeling on the ground with my husband who was profusely bleeding, I looked at Mr. Zale and he had his head turned and was just watching,' said Amy Flemming.  

She has told police that her husband was shot in the head after getting out of his vehicle to ask why Zale was driving aggressively.

She told the newspaper her husband walked up and asked the other driver: 'What's your problem?' 

'And it was a second or maybe two after Derek said that to when there was a gunshot,' Flemming said. 'As soon as I heard the gunshot and I saw him fall, I was getting out of the car and running to him.'

Witness Jenna St Clair told WXYZ that Amy Flemming was on the ground next to her stricken husband, begging him to live.

'She said, "You've got to stay! You've got to stay alive. Stay alive for your kids. We need you, we need you!"' said St. Clair. 

Alleged killer Zale reportedly stood calmly by his car waiting for police to arrive after the shooting.

Calls to 911 came thick and fast from people who had witnessed the altercation, which happened around 3.35pm.

One 911 caller said she 'heard a large pop and somebody screaming.'

'Mrs. Flemming is overcome with many emotions, but primarily shock and extreme grief. In addition, her young children are asking where their father is,' the statement from Moore says.

WXYZ reports that neither man had any criminal record.

Flemming owned his own small landscaping business. He leaves behind his wife and two children - son Julian, 8, and daughter Lily, who turned 6 two days after her father's killing. 

It's unclear if Zale had a permit to carry a concealed weapon.
