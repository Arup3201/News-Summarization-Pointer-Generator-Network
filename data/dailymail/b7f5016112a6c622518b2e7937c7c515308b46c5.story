Brendan Rodgers has urged Roy Hodgson to unleash Raheem Sterling, saying that the Liverpool winger has the talent and temperament to be a World Cup star.

Sterling’s reward for an outstanding campaign was a place in England’s 23-man squad for Brazil.

Rodgers
 said: ‘If Raheem is given the opportunity to play how he can play - he 
is an attacking player, a creative player who works hard - he could be 
one of the stars of the World Cup. He is a 19-year-old boy who has been 
one of the top players in the Barclays Premier League.

Top player: Rodgers believes Sterling has the talent to make an impact for England at this summer's World Cup

‘It is one of the most competitive 
leagues in the world and if he continues to have that confidence to play
 with no fear he could be a really stand-out player.

‘I am sure Roy must be really excited; if you have that quality you can choose from in midfield - Ross Barkley, Steven (Gerrard), Jordan Henderson, Raheem - you just build a framework around that natural talent and let them play.’ 

Rodgers - who was named the LMA Manager of the Year on Monday night - is hoping to wrap up some signings before the World Cup starts next month, with Adam Lallana Liverpool’s prime target.

‘Ideally you would want to get things done beforehand,’ said Rodgers. ‘But transfers are so complex, especially if you are doing a big signing.

‘I would rather have one or two absolute top players than seven that might not help us. It’s about the quality.’
