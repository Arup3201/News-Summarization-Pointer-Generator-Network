Roy Keane has taken aim at Manchester United's 'propaganda' - and described the group of former players working for the club as a 'mafia'.

Keane, the former United captain who played at Old Trafford for 12 years, has not held back with his views in recent weeks as he promotes his latest book The Second Half.

And during an appearance at Lancashire County Cricket Club on Tuesday, Keane was his usual hard-hitting self as he used 1968 European Cup winner Paddy Crerand as an example of the culture at his old club.

In quotes reported by The Guardian, Keane said: 'When I look at United there’s just a lot of propaganda now, a lot of nonsense gets spoken, a lot of ex-players now work for the club, they are on contracts, ex-players from the 60s and 70s working for United and they always try to kid you on.

'They’re all decent lads, don’t get me wrong, but it’s almost like a mafia situation. If you think it’s a sending-off or David Gill might be wrong or Alex Ferguson, you say it. These people are just: "It’s Man United, woh!" It’s like Disneyland – Man United Land, with f****** Mickey Mouse running everywhere.

'People get swayed by Paddy Crerand. Paddy still thinks it’s nineteen-sixty-f******-seven! United have lost 5-0: "Ah, you know, they were great." Paddy, come on, do me a favour. "No, no, United were great." No, they weren’t! Why are you saying it?'
