Although it was jungle princesses Helen Flanagan and Ashley Roberts who stole the limelight in their frontless/backless evening gowns last night at the Sun Military Awards, another TV starlet didn't go unnoticed.

At 42-years-old Melanie Sykes knows what works for her and she showed off her tanned, toned body in a glamorous teal cocktail dress featuring a pretty peplum detail.

But while the other celebrities had splashed out on bank-breaking designer numbers presenter Mel oozed red carpet glamour in a dress from high street favourite Karen Millen.

Melanie's £175 assymetric signature stretch satin pencil dress is currently on sale at Karen Millen.

The mother of two has previously admitted to putting a lot of time and energy into looking good and her intense workout regime involves hitting the gym five times a week.

So
it's no wonder the brunette wanted to show off the results of her 
super-toned figure in the sexy dress.

Get the look for less: The blue satin evening gown is from Karen Millen and priced at £175

She teamed the look with black strappy heels, a statement glitzy clutch and plenty of rosy blusher.

Celebrity fans of the high street label also include Zooey Deschanel, Eva Longoria, Nicole Scherzinger and Tulisa.
