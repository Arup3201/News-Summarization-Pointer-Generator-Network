A rare New Zealand parrot has been hatched from a crushed egg that was put back together using sticky tape and glue.

Conservation workers at the Kakapo Recovery Centre on Codfish Island, New Zealand, found the egg with its shell in pieces inside the nest of its mother, Lisa, but the membrane underneath was still intact.

After painstakingly repairing the shell, and a long wait, the Kakapo parrot chick beat the odds to enter the world.

Hello world: The tiny Kakapo chick begins to hack its way out of the repaired egg

The tiny chick has been named Lisa One, for now, until the sex has been determined.

It is the first Kakapo to be born in New Zealand since 2011, and brings the total population of the endangered bird species to 125.

Recovery programme manager Deidre Vercoe Scott said: ‘We only have five viable eggs on the island of Whenua Hou and this one was the first laid.

‘It was touch and go for a few days but with the special care and expertise of our team, the dedication has paid off.

‘Senior Kakapo ranger Jo Ledington did an incredible job carefully repairing the egg with tape and glue.’

I'm coming up: Little Lisa One, named so as it is the first of five eggs to be hatched from their mother Lisa, enters the world

Little me: A conservation worker holds up the Kakapo chick's head to show just how tiny it is at birth

Naptime: It will take weeks before Lisa one is joined by his or her siblings, until then, conservation workers will do their best to keep it safe and warm

Lisa One is now being kept in an incubator and receiving round-the-clock attention, including regular feeding, weighing and checks.

It will be several weeks before keepers know its gender, by which time the other four eggs, also kept in incubator care, are expected to have hatched

Lisa One's arrival has increased the total population of the critically endangered New Zealand parrot to 125.

The Kakapo, also called owl parrot, is the heaviest parrot species in the world and the only one which cannot fly.

Lisa One will grow to have mottled moss-green feathers which will help him or her use camouflage as the main form of defence.
