Jeb Bush launched a trial balloon attack on presumed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday evening at the launch of his political action committee, taking aim at her foreign policy credentials and economic message.

The Republican businessman currently exploring a presidential bid suggested former Secretary of State Clinton should be held responsible for the foreign policy blunders of the Obama administration, according to an attendee of the Greenwich, Connecticut, event.

Speaking more generally, Bush said, ‘If someone wants to run a campaign about 90s nostalgia, it’s not going to be very successful,’ the source told a reporter for Hearst Connecticut Media Group.

Clinton has not announced her candidacy for president yet but she is already the Democratic frontrunner

Clinton's husband, Bill, held the title of president during the last seven years of the '90s, and the era is often associated in the U.S. with economic prosperity.

In her previous presidential campaign, the former first lady sought to tap into her husband's popularity and wield it to her advantage, telling voters, 'I’ve apprenticed, and I’ve learned how to do it. I have watched it being done for eight years … It took a Clinton to clean up after the first Bush, and it’ll take a Clinton to clean up after the second Bush.'

While longing for years gone by wasn't enough to propel Clinton to victory over Barack Obama in the 2007 Democratic primary, her association with the 'Last Great Decade' did resonate voters.

'During the Clinton administration, we were thriving,' one Pennsylvania resident told a reporter for McClatchy-Tribune at the time.

'We had a home, two cars and my husband had a good job. After the Republicans came in, we lost the house and one of the cars. It was like we lost everything.'

This time around Clinton has kept her political speeches in close alignment with economic initiatives favored by the Obama administration and progressive groups such as equal pay for equal work and paid family leave.

But in a face-off against Bush, whose father lost the presidency to Bill Clinton after only one term and brother exited the Oval Office amid a sky-high unemployment rate, '90s comparisons would likely resurface in Clinton's stump speeches.

That's if either Bush or Clinton competes for the Oval Office at all. Neither have officially declared their candidacies, although both are expected to early in the year.

In preparation for a possible head-to-head challenge with Clinton, Bush is already readying attacks on the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

Ahead of the midterm elections, Bush went after Clinton over her argument that corporations and businesses don't create jobs. 

Clinton's camp swiftly clarified that she meant to say 'our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs,' but the damage was already done.

Bush used the verbal gaffe to highlight his own business acumen.

'Well, the problem in America today is that not enough jobs are being created. They are created by businesses where people’s income rise where they can live a life of purpose and meaning independent of government,' he told a group of Republicans at a Colorado rally.

'That should be the mission,' he continued. 'And the only way that we do that is to create a climate of high sustained economic growth where everybody, everybody in this country has a chance at earned success.'

After serving two terms as governor of Florida, Bush joined the business world, taking seats on a handful of boards, including Barclays bank and Rayonier. As of last week he had resigned those positions to focus on his presidential campaign.

Within hours of his announcement that he would 'actively explore' the presidency, the Democratic National Committee was already imploring its supporters to 'think about how President Bush worked out last time' and comparing Jeb to his brother George, who held the position for eight years directly after Bill Clinton.

At the fundraiser on Wednesday evening for his Right to Rise leadership PAC, Bush also reportedly tested out a response to naysayers who don't want a repeat of either Bush presidencies. 

'Do you have a father? Do you have a brother? Are you the same person?’ he said, according to the the insider who talked to Hearst.
