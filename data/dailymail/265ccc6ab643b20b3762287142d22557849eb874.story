A former St John Ambulance volunteer who sexually assaulted four young girls has been sentenced to 17 years in jail.

Anthony Bint, 51, from Derby, was found guilty of 16 charges, including an attempted rape, that took place between 1978 and 2011. He joined the first-aid organisation during this period.

Sentencing Bint on Friday, Judge John Burgess, Recorder of Derby, said the crimes were the type that 'ruined people’s lives'.

Bint subjected his victims, who described the attacks as 'harrowing' and 'devastating', to a seven-day trial after he denied all charges.

His victims released a joint statement following the sentencing at Derby Crown Court. It said: 'Fifteen months have passed since the first revelations of abuse by this evil monster.

'It was a massive relief for the victims and their families to finally see justice done.

'It has been without doubt the most traumatic time we have ever faced and has deeply affected all concerned.

'We are obviously very concerned about the possible long-term effects on all the victims.

'We can only hope that with the right counselling the mental scars will heal as time passes.'

The victims thanked the police for their 'painstaking efforts' and 'caring support'

They also thanked Judge Burgess 'for his wisdom and also for his sensitivity when addressing the victims'.

Bint’s crimes only came to light in June last year when one of his victims told her mother about the abuse.

Following this, three other victims also reported being abused.

Bint will serve at least half his sentence in prison and the rest on licence.

He will also be banned from any unsupervised contact with children, will be placed on the sex offenders register for life and will be banned from working with children.

Judge Burgess said: 'I have made these orders in order to prevent any sexual offences against children in the future.'

After passing sentence Judge Burgess added: 'I thank the members of the public who behaved with dignity.

'I hope the sentence I pass down today provides some comfort and allows the victims to move on as that is the most important thing.'

Detective Constable Vandome said: 'It has been a very long and complex investigation.

'It has only been possible as a result of the bravery of those that have come forward and told their stories. Without them, Bint may still be committing these offences.

'I am pleased with the sentence that has been passed today, not only because it reflects the hard work and dedication of the officers involved in the investigation but more importantly because the victims have seen justice done.'

A spokesperson for the St John Ambulance said: 'Mr Bint resigned as a volunteer member of St John Ambulance.

'He has had no access to the organisation or its membership activities since.'
