A couple have been arrested after they were caught having sex in their car in a parking lot following a church service, a recent police report has revealed.

Jamel Grant, 26, and 21-year-old Michel Felix Casas were spotted partially clothed during a routine police patrol close to the entrance of the Kroger Grocery Store in Gwinnett County, Georgia on March 31.

Officers approached the car on Easter Sunday around midnight to find Casas performing oral sex on Grant in the front driver's seat.

Grant was naked from the waist down and Casas' breasts were exposed.

According to The Smoking Gun, Grant told police that he and Casas 'were making out' and had driven to the parking lot 'from church where they attended the Easter Service'.

It is unclear which church the couple had attended or which service they would have been to so late in the evening.

The couple also admitted to police that they had not driven to the grocery store to purchase anything.

Police officers detected a strong smell of marijuana when the car window was down and found the couple in possession of the drug.

The couple were charged with public indecency, loitering and prowling along with marijuana possession.
