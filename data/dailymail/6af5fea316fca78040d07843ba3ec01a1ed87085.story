A Georgia mother killed her three children and then took her own life in an apparent murder-suicide at their home about 15 miles outside of Atlanta. Georgia.

Kisha Holmes, 35, of Austell was found dead yesterday morning alongside her nine-month-old daughter, four-year-old son and ten-year-old son. The names of the children have not been released.

A maintenance worker discovered the bodies in the family's apartment in the Walton Crossing housing community when he arrived to repair a clothes dryer.

Cobb County police believe Holmes 'first took the lives of her three children and then her own'. 

The exact causes of death have not been released and it is unclear how long ago the killings occurred. 

The Cobb County Medical Examiner is conducting autopsies on the four bodies. 

Walton Crossing alerted residents that a family had died in one of the apartments in the complex by handing out letters to residents.

'I woke up today and I heard all this craziness going on,' resident Xavier Villalba told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'But no one heard anything. It made me angry. 

'There were four sentences, but no details on what happened.'

Guards were stationed at the Walton Crossing apartments after Holmes and her three children were found dead. The complex alerted residents that a family had died by passing out letters

'I have three daughters myself, so I could never imagine harming my children or how it could get that bad,' neighbor Roland Milton told WXIA.

'I just pray for the family.'

This is the second time since September that an apparent murder investigation has been carried out at the complex, although the first case, a shooting, is not believed to be related. 

Walton Crossing offers 'affordable apartments' for both 'families and working professionals', according to the complex's website.
