A woman teaching assistant who was branded a 'sexual predator' is facing jail after admitting to liaisons with boy pupils after an end-of-year prom.

Emma Webb, 41, a married mother-of-two, was accused of abusing her position of trust with three boys at the secondary school where she worked, which cannot be named for legal reasons.

She wept in the dock as she admitted 16 charges of causing boys aged between 15 and 17 years to engage in sexual activities.

Pleaded guilty: School supply teacher Emma Webb, 41, admitted giving sexual favours to three teenage boys from the school she worked at near Wokingham, Berkshire (pictured)

At her first appearance in June in 
front of Reading magistrates, prosecutor Helen Gambrill described Webb 
as a 'sexual predator'.

Webb was accused of sleeping with one
 pupil on as many as 12 occasions and performing sex acts on him and 
another boy, as well as kissing and groping a third.

She also sent one of the boys graphic images she had taken while performing sex acts on herself, the court heard.

Webb, who worked as a mentor and a 
class cover supervisor, was suspended on May 31 when a colleague 
reported suspicions of her closeness to some pupils. She was arrested 
after one of the alleged victims reported her to his parents and the 
school.

Cried in court: Webb sobbed as the Judge at Reading Crown Court told her she could face jail time for her crimes which included nine counts of sexual activity with a child in a position of trust

Her husband Andy, a plumber who she 
lived with in Woodley, Berkshire, listened from the public gallery. It 
is understood the couple had been together for the past 18 years.

Yesterday at Reading Crown Court Judge
 John Reddihough told her although she would been given 'full credit' 
for pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity, she would not be spared
 jail.

Webb admitted two counts of causing or
 inciting sexual activity with a child; two counts of causing or 
inciting sexual activity with a child in a position of trust; three 
counts of causing a child to watch a sex act by viewing a sexual image 
and nine counts of sexual activity with a child in a position of trust, 
between September, 2009 and October, 2010, in Reading and Wokingham, 
Berkshire.

Webb denied perverting the course of justice by allegedly asking a colleague to change reports about why she was suspended.

She was remanded in custody and will be sentenced next month.

One of her neighbours said: 'I've 
known Emma since she was little. She is the last person in the world I'd
 suspect of doing something like this.'
