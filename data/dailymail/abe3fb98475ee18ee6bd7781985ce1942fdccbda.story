Kim Sears wasn't showing the strain of supporting Britain's number one tennis player as she arrived at Wimbledon today to see him take victory in his first match.

While Murray's mother Judy was seen earlier looking tried and grey, by contrast Kim looked happy and relaxed as she walked towards centre court with Andy's entourage.

She carried a Mulberry handbag as she walked in heels wearing jeans and a cream blouse with an orange stripe down the front.

What pressure? Kim smiles broadly as she walks to centre court to watch her boyfriend

Stylish: The 25 year old wore a blue blazer and jeans as she carried her Mulberry handbag

She topped her outfit off with a colourful blue blazer, a broad smile and perfectly blow dried hair.

But despite her demeanor today, on the BBC documentary broadcast last night called Andy Murray: The Man Behind the Racquet, when asked by Sue Barker if she looked forward to Wimbledon she replied with a laugh: 'No, I used to!'

The 25-year-old is usually seen to be on tenterhooks as Murray goes from round to round as the pressure for him to win on home turf is immense.

Last year he came painstakingly close to becoming the first Brit to win the title in decades as he made the final and won the first set, only to then be defeated by Roger Federer.

He famously choked back tears as he gave a gallant loser speech while Kim was also seen looking tearful in the royal box.

One step closer: Kim applauds as her boyfriend's quest to win Wimbledon gets off to a good start

Kim recalled of the heartbreaking moment: 'There were a lot of tears,
it's just horrible seeing someone you care about going through that. 
The immediate aftermath wasn't pretty.'

But since then she has seen her boyfriend go from strength to strength - winning Olympic gold and silver medals and his first grand slam title in New York.

Murray returned to centre court today to begin his campaign today against German's Benjamin Becker.

Relief: Judy Murray had looked strained earlier in the day but broke into a smile after her son's victory

Supporters: Pippa and James Middleton have been following the centre court action all day and cheered Murray on on his match

The tennis champ took to Twitter ahead of his opener to express gratitude to his fans for their backing and encouragement.

'I'll give everything I have on the court starting with round 1', he wrote.

He was true to his word, beating the German in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.

As well as Kim, also watching from the royal box was his ever present mother, Judy, and tennis fans Pippa and James Middleton.

High hopes: Once again the nation is behind Andy Murray's bid to become Wimbledon champ

Support: Kim told Sue Barker that she doesn't look forward to Wimbledon and it was hard last year when her boyfriend was so upset by his loss in the final

On yesterday's BBC documentary Kim also revealed what it was like to be suddenly thrust into the lime light when he won his first tournament at San Jose in 2006.

She was a teenager still at school at the time and explained: 'I went away with him thinking it's fine because he's never going to win so I'll be back in time for school on Monday and then he did! I remember saying to my mum, you've got to call in and tell them I've got the winter vomiting virus and I won't be in but then it was on the front cover of the paper so I was busted!

'It was a weird for a few days after as I had photographers turning up at my school all the time but after that it calmed down.'
