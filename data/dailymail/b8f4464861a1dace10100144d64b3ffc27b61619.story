South Korea has fired shells into North Korean waters after their rivals sent more than 100 rounds below the disputed sea boundary during a live-fire drill.

The heated artillery exchange was 
prompted by an unusual warning fax sent from the North to the South, 
informing them of their live-fire drill.

Though
 it is not unusual for the reclusive nation to practice at sea, South 
Korean officials were alarmed by the alert, which they claim 'indicates 
their hostile intention'.

It comes just days after Kim Jong Un's reclusive nation threatened to launch a 'new form' of nuclear power tests - and coincidentally during the annual South Korea-US military practice, which North Korea dubs a rehearsal for invasion.

Dispute: The South Korean military shot shells into North Korean waters during a drill after their rivals fired across the sea boundary during their own practice

Residents on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, metres south of the border, were told to seek shelter during the drill. There were no reports of injuries

The heated exchange took place during the US Marines' annual military training with South Korea, which the North brands rehearsal for invasion

According to South Korean military officials, the North fired more than 500 rounds during a three-hour drill - 100 of which crossed the border.

The South fired back 300 rounds from its K-9 self-propelled howitzer batteries, and scrambled F-15 jets.

Residents on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, located in the battle-stricken Yellow Sea, were evacuated to shelters during the exchange.

The Northern Limit Line, a maritime border that wraps itself round a part of the North's coastline, has been the scene of frequent clashes.

In 2010, two civilians and two marines on the island were killed by North Korean military during a border dispute. The North claimed it was provoked by South Korean military exercises.

Earlier that year, 46 people died off the coast of nearby Baengnyeong island after a warship sank. South Korea claims it was gunned down by the North, which their rival neighbour denies.

'The fact that they have sent such a message to us indicates their hostile intention.' said Wi Yong-Seop, a spokesman for the South Korean Defence Ministry.

'The aim is to threaten us and rack up tension on the Yellow Sea border and the overall Korean Peninsula,' he said.

South Korean military (pictured) was alarmed by an early-morning fax from the North warning them to control their vessels in the region as they would be 'training'. Though live-fire training is not uncommon, it is unusual for the rivals to warn one another. The South said it showed hostile intentions

Training: Amphibious assault vehicles of the South Korean Marine Corps were throwing smoke bombs in a drill with the US where they practised moving from sea to shore. But during the morning, more than 100 shells from the North crossed the border. The South responded by shooting back 300 rounds

The message, faxed to South Korea's 
Second Fleet headquarters at 8am local time, warned officials to control
 their vessels in the tensely-guarded western sea as they would be 
conducting live-fire drills later in the day, officials said.

It stated that all action would be north of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), but did not specify what time it would take place.

Seoul officials claim the move is an 
expression of Pyongyang's frustration at failing to win outside aid in 
recent weeks despite numerous attempts.

And
 since the UN published a report early this month accusing Kim Jong-Un 
of war crimes akin to Nazi Germany, the reclusive nation has increased 
threatening rhetoric and conducted a series of rocket and ballistic 
missile launches.

This weekend, tensions rapidly intensified.

On Saturday, North Korea also accused the South of 'gangster-like' behaviour by 'abducting' one of its fishing boats and threatened to retaliate. The South said it had sent the boat back after it drifted into its waters.

Hours later, Pyongyang threatened to 
conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point.

After the North's warning fax early this morning, South Korea responded that it would react strongly if provoked.

North Korea blasted the response, with one military official Yun Jong Bum telling the North's official news agency: 'The boneheads appear to have completely forgotten the fact that Yeonpyeong island was smashed by our military's bolt of lightning a few years ago.'

There were no specific targets during this morning's exchange, and no
 shells from either side were fired at any land or military 
installations, claimed an official with South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The Northern Limit Line was drawn up at the end of the 
1950-53 Korean War - and North Korea does not recognise it.

Last time the US trained with South Korea, the North sent near-daily threats, including warnings of nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington

The two sides 
are still technically at war as the conflict ended in a mere truce, not a
 treaty.

'It's up to the two
 militaries either to recognise or reject their own claimed line, and 
challenge the other's - this goes back and forth, so this is probably 
another episode of that,' said Daniel Pinkston of the International 
Crisis Group.

Earlier in
 2010, a South Korean naval vessel was sunk close to the line by what an
 international commission said was a North Korean torpedo, although the 
North denies involvement.

Today, Kang
 Myeong-sung, a resident speaking from a shelter on Yeonpyeong island, which is in 
sight of North Korean territory, said that anxious islanders were 
huddled together in shelters.

Kang said he didn't see any fighter jets, 
but he could hear the boom of artillery fire.

It
 is not the first time conflict has broken out during the South Korea-US
 military drills, which the North calls a rehearsal for invasion. The 
allies say they're routine and defensive.

Last spring, tension spiked after a 
near-daily barrage of North Korean threats, including warnings of 
nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington, following international 
criticism of Pyongyang's third nuclear test in February of that year.

Pyongyang routinely test-fires artillery and missiles into the ocean, but it's rare for the country to disclose such training plans in advance

On Sunday, Pyongyang threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point, though Seoul says there are no signs of an imminent detonation

But the North has gradually dialed 
down its threats and sought to improve ties with South Korea in what 
foreign analysts say is an attempt to lure international investment and 
aid.

There has been no 
major breakthrough in the North's reported push to win outside aid, 
however, with Washington and Seoul calling on the North to first take 
disarmament steps to prove its sincerity about improving ties, analysts 
say.

The North Korean live-fire drills and the country's hints at a nuclear test are meant to express anger and frustration over what the North sees as little improvement in progress in its ties with South Korea and the US, said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University.

Lim said the North might conduct a fourth nuclear test and launch other provocations to try to wrest the outside concessions it wants.

The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

About 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea.
