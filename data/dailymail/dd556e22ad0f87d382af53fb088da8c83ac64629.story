A restaurant chain has been accused of racism after tweeting an advert that suggested tacos must be loved by anyone called Juan.

Dave&Buster's sent a message from the company's official Twitter account saying: '"I hate tacos" said no Juan ever'.

It was followed by the hashtags #TacoTuesday #DaveandBusters.

Critics were quick to attack the company on social media for exploiting two Mexican stereotypes - one of its most popular dishes and one of its most common first names - to promote its food.

Rich Homo Quan tweeted: 'Not funny and actually pretty racist. Do better.'

Jake Parackal added: 'Dave & Buster's just posted a tweet it's going to regret for a long time.'

However, others said it was an over-reaction.

Amanda Vega said: 'Anyone who didn't get the joke or took offense is lacking in sense of humor and something to do with their time.'

The company later deleted the tweet and apologised.

South Carolina Mexican restaurant Taco Cid came under fire in January last year after staff were given T-shirts which show tacos as bait in a trap underneath the words 'how to catch an illegal immigrant'.

A year earlier, the mayor of a Connecticut community who was criticised for allegedly racist remarks about Latinos was inundated by a deluge of tacos at his East Haven office.

The send-the-mayor-a-taco campaign, which took off via tweets, texts and social media websites , resulted in more than 2,000 tacos being delivered to Mayor Joseph Maturo.

He came in for criticism when he said he 'might have tacos' as a way to do something to help Hispanic people in a town roiled by allegations of police discrimination.
