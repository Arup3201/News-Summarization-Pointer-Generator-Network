Controversy: Stephanie Banister appeared to think that Islam was a country when she was interviewed on Australian TV

An Australian election candidate has drawn comparisons to Sarah Palin after an embarrassing interview in which she displayed ignorance of basic facts about Islam.

Stephanie Banister referred to Islam as a country, and confused the word 'halal' with 'haram' - which has the opposite meaning.

She also claimed that Jews follow the teachings of Jesus, and was unable to name her two opponents for a parliamentary seat in Brisbane.

Ms Banister, 27, is a trained welder who is contesting the House of Representatives seat of Rankin for the anti-immigrant One Nation party in next month's federal election.

The mother of two rose to prominence when she was arrested for going into a supermarket and putting stickers saying 'halal food funds terrorism' on NestlÃ© products.

However, in an interview with Channel Seven yesterday she made multiple errors about the most rudiment tenets of the religion.

She said: 'I don't oppose Islam as a country, but I do feel that their laws should not be welcome here in Australia.'

Ms Banister then repeatedly referred to 'haram', which means 'sinful', when she apparently meant to say 'halal', which means the opposite and is commonly used to refer to the faith's laws about preparing food.

'Less than two per cent of Australians follow haram,' she told the interviewer.

When asked if she opposed the Jewish laws of kosher, Ms Banister incorrectly replied: 'Jews aren't under haram. They have their own religion which follows Jesus Christ.'

She added: 'They don't have a tax on it, they just have a certain way of making it, where haram has a tax on the food.'

In fact, bodies which certify either kosher or halal food charge a fee for their services.

Ms Banister was asked to name her opponents in the seat from the two mainstream parties, but admitted: 'I'm still learning all of the names of people in politics.'

She continued: 'Everyone in the world has a lot to learn about day-to-day stuff and everything in life is just about learning.'

Comparison: Some have compared Ms Banister to former U.S. vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin

The candidate later told Fairfax Media that she had meant to say 'Islamic countries', adding: 'Unfortunately, they've completely twisted all my words and made me out to be a stand-up criminal and a stupid moron.'

Ms Banister is an extreme long-shot for the Rankin seat, which is a toss-up between Labor's Jim Chalmers and David Lin of the Liberals.

She is currently facing a charge of 'contaminating or interfering with goods' over the supermarket incident, and will be disqualified from the September 7 election if she is convicted before then.
