Tottenham fan Sam Warburton got over his Six Nations woe by receiving a shirt from Spurs legend Ledley King at half-time of the north London derby.

Wales captain Warburton was presented with the shirt by the former Tottenham captain to commemorate the flanker’s 50th international appearance.

The gift is bound to have cheered up Warburton who tasted defeat with Wales on Friday night and witnessed his Tottenham side fall behind early on thanks to Arsenal’s German midfielder Mesut Ozil.

Warburton is such a big fan of Tottenham and former England international King he named his dog after the 34-year-old.

He revealed in a video on Kicca.com: ‘My dog is called Ledley, after Ledley King because he is my favourite Tottenham player.

‘It’s a Labradoodle. My wife picked the breed, but I told her it had to be named Ledley. That argument was not up for discussion.’

Warburton also revealed he has two others dogs named after Alfie Conn and Michael Dawson as well as growing up with three dogs called Teddy Sheringham, Gustavo Poyet and Glenn Hoddle as a youngster.
