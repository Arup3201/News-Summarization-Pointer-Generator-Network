An abattoir boss who failed to track horse carcasses from pasture to plate could be jailed after he became the first person to admit crimes linked with the fake beef scandal. 

Peter Boddy, 65, ran a slaughterhouse which sold horse meat to customers in the run-up to the  furore over fake beef which gripped Britain from January 2013.

Three months ago he admitted failing to keep adequate records on 50 horses between May 2012 and February 2013. Today he admitted a second charge relating to 17 horses.

Wearing a khaki hunting jacket and a deerstalker, Boddy was warned he could be facing jail - with the maximum possible term set at two years.

Boddy ran a slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, with 54-year-old manager David Moss, who also appeared in court today.

Moss admitted one charge of falsifying an invoice which related to one of the sales.

However, he denied failing to comply with food traceability requirements and another charge of failing to abide by EU meat traceability regulations. Both charges were ordered to lie on file. 

The court heard the animals could have entered the human food chain after Boddy failed to keep records that traced them from pasture to plate.

Although there was no suggestion he had duped his customers, it was unclear where the animals had ended up because meat traceability laws were not followed.

Judge Alistair McCreath warned the pair: 'I tell you now, I have reached no view whatever as to the right sentence.

'No preliminary view, no settled view, nothing. I say that so that you understand that by granting you bail and ordering reports I don't give you any indication.

'So don't run away with the idea that I have given you any kind of hint, any kind of indication or promise what is going to happen with you.'

Boddy, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, and Moss, from Higher Moss, West Yorkshire, will be sentenced on March 23.

In a separate prosecution Dafydd Raw-Rees, 66, and Colin Patterson, 44, are charged with a catalogue of food-labelling failures over the food firm they ran in Aberystwyth.

Their company, Farmbox Meats Limited, allegedly sold goat meat to unwitting customers as 'lamb trim' and 'lamb shanks'.

Raw-Rees and Patterson are also accused of processing horse carcasses, without regard for traceability guidelines.

They have yet to enter a plea to that charge, but have denied 19 counts of mislabelling meat products from their company. 

Raw-Rees and Patterson, both from the village of Bow Street, Dyfed, are on bail and will face trial on May 18 at Southwark Crown Court.
