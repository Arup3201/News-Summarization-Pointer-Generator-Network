Something is happening in W12. It's been happening for quite some time, but Shey Boo (the area formerly known as Shepherds Bush) is suddenly chic. 

The opening of Westfield White City in 2008 heralded a new era for the once shabby area of west London as a shopping destination. 

And with a Hummingbird Bakery, Soho House opening up a private members club, and famous faces including actress Carey Mulligan and her Mumford and Sons' star husband Marcus Mumford, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Michael Gambon and Prince Harry's on-off girlfriend Cressida Bonus taking up residence, Shepherd's Bush's transformation is almost complete.

New Shepherd's Bush: 'Shey Boo' is undergoing a makeover as affluent Londoners move in

Sleek: The Dorsett Shepherd's Bush is part of the changing face of the area, opening this month

Bordering Holland Park and Kensington, the area is now welcoming a host of affluent Londoners driven out by rising real estate prices.

Late last year a shiny  hotel, Dorsett Shepherd's Bush opened, welcoming perhaps a slightly less hip crowd than those Soho House, but just as savvy to the area's new status.

The four-star hotel is housed within a Grade II listed building, originally known as The Shepherd's Bush Pavilion and formerly a cinema, built in 1923.

It launched with a glittering opening party that featured Chinese drummers, aerial artists serving champagne and terracotta warriors.

Comfort: The hotel boasts contemporary rooms with chic touches, while remaining reasonable on the wallet

The  Dorsett boasts contemporary rooms with chic touches, while remaining reasonable on the wallet.

The suites are spacious and well appointed, with many enjoying splendid views across the neighbouring Green. Do be aware when booking though that a handful of suites overlook the atrium or have no view at all - make sure to ask at check-in.

The Spa on the fifth floor is great for a post-meeting massage, but with no pool or Jacuzzi, it is more about the individual treatments than luxurious ladies day at the spa. The space has been utilised well for the type of guests the hotel is likely to attract.

Regeneration: Shepherd's Bush Market is also undergoing a £150million makeover

Where The Dorsett excels is catering to its business travellers. Modern, comfortable rooms that provide all the mod-cons they could need, a sleek bar and meeting space in the impressive atrium, and all a short tube ride from central London.

Around the corner from the hotel, Shepherd's Bush Market is also undergoing a £150million makeover.

Designed by Robin Partington & Partners and with works carried out by  Excel Demolition & Groundworks, the market will reopen early next year as a 'transitional' Box Park style market space. 

As in Shoreditch, the market will house shipping containers for traders to operate from until the main market is completed.

Urban: Similar to the market in Shoreditch, traders will operate from shipping containers at the pop-up market

The regeneration is to include 212 new apartments including townhouses, flats and mews houses, as well as new shops and restaurants within the market and along Goldhawk Road.

A spokesperson for Shepherd's Bush Market told MailOnline, ‘Shepherd’s Bush Market is changing…with the imminent regeneration scheme which will represent a £150m investment in the market and the wider area.

'This investment will secure a vibrant future for the market and lay the foundations for the area in the long term. The regeneration of this area will create new homes, new opportunities for start-up businesses, and revitalize this special and much loved London market.

Meanwhile, the BBC Television Centre is to be converted into a mixed-use development. As well as the BBC studio and a 'media hub', the site will be transformed into a leisure and entertainment venue.

Watch this space.
