An Indianapolis man has won two $1 million lottery prizes in the past three months.

Robert Hamilton won $1 million from a scratch-off ticket he bought last week at an Indianapolis convenience store, Hoosier Lottery officials say.

His other big win came in April in western Indiana's Jasonville while traveling to a conference.

Robert Hamilton beat the one in 2.1 million odds two different times playing the Hoosier Lottery's Cash Spectacular scratch-off game

Hamilton says he used his first prize to pay off debts, buy a home and invest in his business. He now plans to buy a motorcycle.

Hamilton will continue to work and his wife Donna told WishTV.com that the prize money won't change their lives too much.

'We're just everyday, normal people', she said.

The lottery says Hamilton's tickets are among eight top prizes for its $120 Million Cash Spectacular Scratch-off game.

Lottery officials say the odds of winning a top prize from the game are one in 2.1 million.
