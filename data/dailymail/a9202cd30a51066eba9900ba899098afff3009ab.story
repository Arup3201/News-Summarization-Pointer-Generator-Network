It's art in the most temporary form.

For as soon as the tide comes in, Chris Howarth's beautiful beach designs are lost forever.

Talented 'sand artist' Chris, 25, of Marazion, Cornwall, drives to nearby Gwithian beach where he spends an hour on each creation using nothing more than his trusty rake.

Inspired by the work of sand artist Tony Platt, Chris bought himself a rake and headed to his local beach to give it a try

The talented artist places his rake into the sand and experimenting with lines and swirls until he spots patterns emerging 

He drags the rake through the sand to create an array of impressive geometric shapes, which are washed away as soon as the tide comes in. 

But Chris says he doesn't mind that his work only has a limited life-span - as he has managed to capture all his designs on camera, with a beautiful background created by the beach's dramatic cliff face.

Inspired by the work of fellow Cornwall-based sand artist Tony Plant, who has created intricate works on Great Western beach in Newquay, Chris bought himself a rake and headed to his local beach to give it a try.

He said: 'I like the idea of creating these pieces and then they just wash away.

'Someone took a picture and shared it on the St Michaels Mount Facebook page and overnight it had 300 likes, so I thought this is something I could do.'

Chris, who describes his work as temporary graffiti approaches each beach like a blank canvas, placing his rake into the sand and experimenting with lines and swirls until he spots patterns emerging.

Describing his work as temporary graffiti, he refuses to plan his artwork in advance - instead he follows the contours of the rocks and cliff faces, letting the rake decide its own path.

He said: 'I just follow the rocks and cliffs or just walk and see what the rake does.

'I just went to the beach and thought I wonder what this will look like and took it from there.

Chris had a special message for Mother's Day, drawing what every mum in the land will have wanted, some flowers

Chris drives to nearby Gwithian beach because of its size and over-looking cliff face, which is perfect for photos

'I wanted to give something to the public when they are out and about - something totally different on the beach.'

Chris has now been commissioned to create some of his unique artwork for local Cornish businesses, including a law firm from Truro and a Falmouth based festival organiser.

More of his artwork is available online, on his 'One Man and His Rake' Facebook page. 

Spotting a perfect opportunity for some self-promotion, this design is accompanied by a teaser to his Facebook page

In almost a perfect circle, this design could be a football, or it could just be a mesemerising mesh of circles...
