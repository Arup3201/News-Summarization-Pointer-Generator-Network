A paedophile who downloaded child pornography so horrific that a judge could not even bear to watch the evidence tapes has been allowed to walk free from court.

Andrew Townsend, 51, of Hulme, Manchester, downloaded hundreds of vile photographs but was allowed to walk free after the judge ruled he would not learn his lesson behind bars.

Judge Lindsey Kushner, who looked at a sample of the 1,400 images before sentencing him, said she could not bear to watch all the contents of one of the videos featuring extremely graphic content.

Townsend admitted 11 counts of downloading and sharing the pictures and videos after police raided his home in April last year. The judge said that what he did was not a victimless crime.

Judge Kusher told him: ‘You must be aware the subjects of these images are not indifferent to what is happening to you. The public must be made aware of just how infectious this material is.’

But the judge, sitting at Manchester Crown Court, rejected the option of sending Townsend to prison and instead gave him a three-year community order.

The court was told the rigorous programme, supervised by specialist probation officers, would not be available to him if he went to prison.

Judge Kushner said: ‘I’m not doing this because I’m frightened of sending someone to prison.

'This is a successful programme with proven results. It is not to get people through the system quicker or to save money.’

The court was told Townsend co-operated immediately with police when they seized computers, telling them where to find the images.

Judge Kushner described Townsend, who 
works in a bank, as a ‘quiet little man’ leading a humdrum life. He was 
diagnosed with HIV in 2001, and after a period of depression became more
 reclusive.

He began downloading relatively mild child porn and then progressed to hardcore images, sharing them with other people. His defence lawyer said Townsend was relieved when he was caught and was genuinely ashamed.

The court was told the likely 12 months he would spend in prison would mean he would not be able to get the help he needed to stop him re-offending.

Townsend was banned from unsupervised contact with under-16s and restrictions were placed on his use of the internet and computers.

Paedophile: Matthew Thain, of south-east London, breached the terms of his suspended sentence

A renowned gymnastics coach who abused students as young as six over 40 years avoided jail for a second time last month.

Robert 'Bob' Bellew, 66, of New Cross, south-east London, admitted attacking girls at schools and gyms across the country, but was given a 15-month suspended prison sentence in April after a judge said he had shown remorse.

Three senior judges at London's Appeal Court then rejected a bid by the Solicitor General, Oliver Heald QC, to jail Bellew at the second time of asking and to increase his sentence.

A man who sexually abused two little girls as they picked fruit at his allotment avoided jail in April because a judge ruled it would be unfair to the attacker’s own family.

Gary Karn, 48, of Norwich, Norfolk, inappropriately touched his victims, aged seven and eight, after inviting them into his greenhouse to help themselves to raspberries as they played at nearby allotments owned by one of their fathers. But he escaped with a suspended sentence.

A paedophile spared jail for molesting a toddler and a schoolgirl walked free again earlier this month despite lying to police about meeting the young sister of a girlfriend.

Matthew Thain, 21, of Camberwell, south-east London, also breached the terms of his suspended sentence by getting in touch with one of his former victims.

Thain escaped jail in 2010 after a judge ruled intensive supervision would protect other children from the teenage paedophile.
