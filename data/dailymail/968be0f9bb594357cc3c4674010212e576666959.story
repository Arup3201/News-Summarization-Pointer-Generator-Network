Arsenal for the title? That extraordinary possibility cannot now be batted away as pure whimsy after Olivier Giroud’s prolific goal run continued, inspiring his side to overcome Newcastle.

This win doesn’t merely cement Arsenal’s top-four place but gives Chelsea and Manchester City above them reason to look over shoulders with increasing concern.

Giroud’s goals came within a four-minute first-half spell, the first off his thigh, the second from a header. They take the 28-year-old’s recent tally to nine goals in nine games in all competitions. He also has eight in six games against Newcastle since his £10million move in summer 2012 from Montpellier.

Newcastle were a distant second best in the first half but were impressive after the break, testing Arsenal’s mettle as Moussa Sissoko gave them a consolation.

The upshot is Arsenal are just a point behind City and four behind leaders Chelsea, albeit with Chelsea having two games in hand. Chelsea remain odds-on favourites to win the title race. Rightly. But whisper it: this is a race now of sorts, a contest at least, with the season’s biggest prize remaining a feasible for more than one team, for now.

‘Chelsea at the moment I feel have enough [of a ] cushion to be serene,’ said Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger, asked about his side’s title chances. ‘Chelsea have too much security.’

But asked if his players believe they can now cause what would be an amazing upset, he added: ‘We are in a fight right until the end. We will keep on fighting.’

Wenger’s counterpart John Carver said: ‘Until they scored the two goals I thought we were in it. But we conceded from two set plays and that’s disappointing.’ Leaving aside the two-legged exit to Monaco in the Champions League, things have been going Arsenal’s way of late. They have won 14 of their last 16 games, and all six of their last six games.

That is title-challenging form and their eight Premier League fixtures to come offer the tantalising opportunity to advance their own cause while damaging those immediately around them.

Their next game is at home to Liverpool in a fortnight before a trip to Burnley. After that comes what could prove to be a pivotal showdown against Chelsea — at the Emirates. 

They then play at Hull, at home to Swansea and at Manchester United before finishing with back-to-back home games against Sunderland and West Brom.

Newcastle, relatively safe but unremarkable in mid-table continue to frustrate their fans — although they came flying from the blocks in the second half. 

Carver brushed aside any suggestion his team are free-wheeling. 

‘In the second half we took the game to them and we can take a lot from that,’ he said. ‘We’re not on the beach in flip-flops, that’s for sure.’

Arsenal found fertile territory down the right, winning a series of set-pieces. Santi Cazorla’s free-kick found Alexis Sanchez on the left and his shot was blocked by Ryan Taylor. 

Another Cazorla cross was aimed at Giroud but Tim Krul gathered it. 

Then came the free-kick that broke the deadlock, Cazorla delivering to Danny Welbeck, whose flicked head-on fell into the path of Giroud, off whose leg the ball flew in.

Two minutes later it was 2-0, with Cazorla again the provider, this time from a corner. Giroud was being ‘marked’ by Mike Williamson, or rather Williamson was standing next to him as the ball came in. Giroud did not even need to launch himself from the ground to meet the ball with his head, simply leaning forward to steer home.

Newcastle responded with a hat-trick of chances in 40 seconds. Sammy Ameobi’s left-footed shot was blocked, as was Sissoko’s shot, and then Remy Cabella’s header.

After the break their urgency increased still further. They reduced the deficit after Taylor and Cabella exchanged passes, and Cabella crossed to Sissoko, who converted.

Newcastle’s tails were up and Ayoze Perez twice unleashed powerful shots that went narrowly over. Yoan Gouffran then shot straight at David Ospina before Williamson tested the Arsenal keeper properly with a header. Ospina made a brilliant reaction save with his legs from Perez four minutes from time to keep Arsenal’s lead intact — and a dream run at the title still viable.
