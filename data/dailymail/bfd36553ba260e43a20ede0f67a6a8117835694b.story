Tottenham have no plans to bid for Saido Berahino in January.

Manager Maurico Pochettino is aware that the West Bromwich Albion is keen on a move away from The Hawthorns but the 21-year-old is not high on Tottenham's list of priorities.

Pochettino will listen to offers for Aaron Lennon, Kyle Naughton, Paulinho, Etienne Capoue and Vlad Chiriches and is prepared to bring in players from his academy ahead of what he anticipates will be a relatively quiet transfer window.

New Baggies manager Tony Pulis would want in the region of £20million for the England international

Should substantial bids come in for Roberto Soldado, who is wanted on loan by AC Milan, or Emmanuel Adebayor, they could go too but Pochettino will not necessarily turn to Berahino with Burnley's Danny Ings and Southampton's Jay Rodriguez also in his thoughts.

West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis played Berahino in the FA Cup tie against Gateshead and will assess the England U21 international over the next few weeks.

He would want around £20million should he decide to sell which would limit the market further for the 21-year-old.

Albion's club record £10m signing Brown Ideye could also yet be sold.
