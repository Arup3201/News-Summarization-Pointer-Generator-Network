The number of people unemployed in France has reached 3million for the first time since 1999, bringing the rate up to 10 per cent the country's leaders say.

President Francois Hollande is under even more pressure to tackle France's unemployment levels and his administration has come under attack for not doing enough to fix the economy.

Breaking through the 3million mark carries more symbolic importance than economic.

France's Ministry of Employment says the 3million threshold was crossed in 1996 and again in 1999.

Employment Minister Michel Sapin confirmed the total on French radio on Sunday and warned that the numbers would likely get worse. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called the numbers 'very violent'.

The government announced last week that it had counted more than 2.9 million unemployed people in July, so the threshold was expected to be passed in August.

Meanwhile, the largest labour union in Greece warned the country's unemployment could reach 29 per cent in 2013 if the government carries out more planned austerity measures, expected to exceed 11.5 billion Euros - $14.4 billion - for 2012-13.

Savvas Rombolis, head of research at the GSEE labour union said: 'The course of the Greek economy is one 
of decline. In 2012, we are expecting a drop in gross domestic product 
of 7 percent.

'This will create unemployment of 24 percent level - 1.2 
million people,'

'Our estimate is that in 2013, unemployment will be between 28 and 29 percent - more than 1.4 million people. That's because we expect the economy to remain in decline.'

The predictions are to be included in a report that will be published Thursday.

Unemployment in May reached 23.1 per cent, with the under-25 jobless rate hitting 54.9 percent.

Greece is relying on emergency loans from the other 16 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund to avoid bankruptcy. Riots erupted in Athens earlier this year as the full scale of the country's financial crisis emerged

Greeks on minimum wage have seen their spending power reduced to 1979 levels, while those earning an average salary have been pushed back to the equivalent of the early 1980s

The report, Rombolis said, also found that Greeks on minimum wage have seen their spending power reduced to 1979 levels, while those earning an average salary have been pushed back to the equivalent of the early 1980s - after analysing wage trends, the price of goods and services, and the impact of successive tax hikes since Greece's major financial crisis began in late 2009.

Greece is relying on emergency loans from the other 16 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund to avoid bankruptcy. It is likely to slash pensions and other benefits further in the new austerity package - which the government says is vital to keep on receiving loan payments and remain a member of the eurozone.

European and IMF debt inspectors are due back in Athens at the end of the week, along with European Council President Herman van Rompuy, while Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras is travelling to Germany to meet Tuesday with counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble.

In Athens, meanwhile, private doctors working with the country's largest state-run healthcare provider have started charging their patients, in protest at the organization's unpaid bills.

A doctors' association said the action against the provider EOPYY started Monday and will last at least five days. Pharmacists launched a similar protest at the weekend, refusing to hand out prescriptions from the state-backed insurer.

Police are planning a uniformed demonstration in Athens Thursday to protest likely new pay cuts, while an association representing public prosecutors and other court officials says it will slash operating hours at Greece's backlogged courts if their pay is reduced.
