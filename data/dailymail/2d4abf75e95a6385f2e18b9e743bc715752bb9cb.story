Laurent Koscielny is Arsene Wenger's latest injury concern after he was released by France to return to Arsenal for treatment on an achilles problem.

The knock is only regarded as minor but it is another headache for Wenger at a time when injuries are piling up at an alarming rate.

Mesut Ozil was sent home from Germany after scans on his left knee revealed ligament damage which is expected to rule him out for up to three months.

France Football Federation's statement read: 'Since joining [France in] Clairefontaine on Monday, October 6, Laurent Koscielny has been suffering with chronic tendinitis of both achilles tendons for several months.

'Without noting any favourable changes for three days, and after discussion with the player and Franck Le Gall, doctor of the France team, Didier Deschamps decided to release Laurent Koscielny to his club.' 

Arsenal do not expect Koscielny's injury to force him out of action and anticipate he will be fit for their next game, against Hull City, in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday week.

Laurent Koscielny joins the Arsenal injury list which also includes...

Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy, Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry, Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and David Ospina 

The centre half has returned from international duty as a precaution because France, as hosts of Euro 2016, are not involved in qualifying games.

He will be missing friendlies against Portugal and Armenia rather than competitive games.

Wenger will be anxious that the slight problem does not turn into anything more serious, as the defensive cover in his squad has already been exposed.

Mathieu Debuchy is out for three months after an ankle operation, which has forced teenager Calum Chambers to be promoted to a first-team regular.

Chambers has responded well but without Koscielny, Wenger would have to consider moving the young England defender into the middle with Per Mertesacker and bringing in Hector Bellerin, another inexperienced youngster.
