A rogue detective has been jailed after he illegally searched his own force's database and tipped off a convicted drug dealer about raids and arrests.

Daniel Watts, 31, passed crucial intelligence to 33-year-old Stephen Hunt from West Midlands Police computers for more than seven years.

Police today declared that 'no police officer is above the law' after Watts was jailed for 28 months.

Stafford Crown Court heard the detective, from Erdington, West Midlands, joined the force more than 10 years ago and first leaked data to Hunt in April 2005 while he was on trial for supplying drugs.

He was repeatedly 'tasked' by Hunt to make the illegal searches and pass information on the drug dealer and his criminal associates.

The illegal checks continued up until Watts was discovered in March last year when police raided
 the home of a crime suspect.

There they seized a mobile phone containing a text message which, via another phone, was traced to a
 mobile used by Watts.

The text message was about police raids and was so accurate, it could only have been provided from 
confidential police systems.

Anti-corruption
 officers were able to prove the message originated from a phone 
attributable to Watts and was sent when he was on duty and using a 
police computer work station.

At first the former detective admitted his checks were not for legitimate police business - but claimed they were 'out of curiosity', or to check whether what Hunt was telling him was accurate.

At the start of
 their friendship Watts said the checks were conducted to ensure he was 
not associating with a criminal and he claimed not to have sent any 
confidential or sensitive information, or anything Hunt would not 
already have known.

But Watts later admitted conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office in court.

He was sacked by West Midlands Police for gross misconduct on August 29 last year and was jailed in October. His case could not be reported until now because Hunt was facing a drugs trial.

Hunt, from West Heath, Birmingham, denied conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office but was found guilty and jailed for 28 months.

For the drug dealing offences, he was handed an extra 10 years' jail.

Superintendent Tim Godwin from West 
Midlands Police’s Professional Standards Department said: 'Police 
officers take a vow to serve the public and uphold the law with 
fairness, integrity and impartiality. Any that fall short of those 
standards, or who abuse their position, will face disciplinary action, 
the prospect of criminal prosecution and potential dismissal.

'No
 police officer is above the law. Daniel Watts was a rogue officer who 
believed he could discretely pass information to a friend in the 
criminal fraternity - but we have a dedicated team of anti-corruption 
officers whose job is to uncover any misconduct.

'As
 soon as Watts was suspected of acting improperly an investigation was 
launched that resulted in his arrest and suspension from duty. He was 
subsequently sacked by the Chief Constable at an internal hearing, 
following his guilty plea in court, and has now been jailed.

'His
 police career is over and he faces the prospect of having his police 
pension seized; he’s rightly paid a very high price for these breaches 
of trust and position.'

Police said an application to seize all or part of Watts' police pension is under way, with the final decision on how much to confiscate being taken by the Home Secretary.
