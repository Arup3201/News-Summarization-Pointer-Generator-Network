A toddler's mother was overjoyed today after her son was given the all-clear from four tumours despite doctors first suggesting he just had constipation.

Sophie Maloney refused to accept the initial diagnosis on her son Oliver and a local GP said that the lump in his tummy could be to do with his bladder.

An MRI scan revealed he had a large tumour on his prostate, rib, and others on his spine and left thigh.

In remission: Oliver with his mother Sophie Maloney at home in Nottingham. He was treated with the colon cancer drug Avastin

He was accepted on an international drugs trial of Avastin and has now been given the all clear, after the tumours disappeared. Avastin is more commonly used to treat bowel cancer and breast cancer that has spread to other sites in the body.

When his parents Sophie and Simon Lee, 37, first took Oliver to hospital with stomach pain in November 2011, doctors thought he had constipation.

But Ms Maloney from Nottingham told doctors at the Queen's Medical Centre she was sure it was something more serious.

Doctors then found the tumours which were diagnosed as rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma - a cancer that starts in muscles.

There are only around 60 cases of this type of tumour in the UK each year.

Sophie, 38, said: 'Our whole world fell apart, I can still remember the consultant telling us the news. It was awful.

'I thought our world had ended - my legs gave way with shock. It was a bit of a lottery whether he would get accepted on to the drug trial.

'We knew there was not a lot known about this drug, but we thought it was worth a shot.

'We were really pleased that he got on it, we wanted to give him the best chance possible.'

Ollie went through nine cycles of intensive chemotherapy and the new cancer drug eradicated most the tumours in his body and reduced the one on his prostate down to 1cm. Further focused radiotherapy saw that cancer disappear as well.

His consultant Professor David Walker said: 'The results of the drug are yet to be collated, but Oliver was able to reap the benefits of being part of that research.

'The Government invested heavily into research so that cancer sufferers have the best opportunity to have the best cancer drugs available.'
