Worldwide hit hock show Pawn Stars is coming down under.

MailOnline can reveal a local production of the show has been filming at Bondi Beach pawn shop Happy Hockers since Monday, with a planned shooting schedule of roughly nine weeks.

A Foxtel spokeswoman confirmed the Aussie version will screen on A&E (Arts and Entertainment) later this year.

An official announcement is expected from the network in coming days and it is understood a specific premiere date has not been set.

It remains uncertain if the American stars of the smash show will be making cameo appearances, however the spokeswoman said 'obviously we'd love it'.

Leftfield Pictures, who produce the American version of the show, are in Australia shooting the episodes.

Brothers 'Baz' and 'Shaz', the eccentric and charismatic managers of the Bondi store, will star in the new series.

Weird and wonderful: The brothers say they love trading in 'unique and collectable items'

On their website they say they have learned to put their customers first over 20 years in the buy, swap and sell business.

'We love searching for and unearthing interesting items. We love unique and collectable items,' they write.

'What makes us different is that we are willing and able to go the extra mile for our customers.

'Every day is so different and keeps us on our toes. One minute you could be selling a mobile phone the next appraising a painting or collectable guitar.'

Local casting producers have been trawling online classifieds service Gumtree in search of Sydneysiders trying to offload weird and wonderful objects.

Inspiration: Corey Harrison (left), Rick Harrison (middle) and Austin 'Chumlee' Russell of the original Pawn Stars have sparked a worldwide ratings smash

The original American show, filmed at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, has become a worldwide ratings smash and spawned spinoff versions in the UK and southern America.

The Las Vegas cast features three generations of the Harrison family (Richard, Rick and Corey) alongside their hapless, but occasionally brilliant, friend Austin 'Chumlee' Russell.

The success of the show has also inspired a number of copycat series, the most popular of which - Hardcore Pawn - is based in the American Jewelry and Loan store in downtown Detroit. It is known for profiling colourful, often poor, customers and their attempts to secure exorbitant amounts of money for close-to-worthless items.
