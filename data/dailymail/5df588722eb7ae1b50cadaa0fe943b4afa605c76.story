Pakistani national Abid Naseer has finally been extradited to the U.S. on terrorism charges after a two year legal fight

Police in Britain have extradited a terror suspect to the United States to face charges that he took part in an alleged al-Qaeda plot to detonate explosives on the New York City subway system in the biggest plot since the September 11 attacks.

Authorities handed Abid Naseer, 26, over to U.S. authorities on Thursday.

Prosecutors want Naseer to stand trial in the U.S. for his alleged role in a terror campaign that would have struck targets in Britain and Norway as well as New York.

Pakistani-national Naseer was arrested
 in the U.K. in 2010 after being indicted in the U.S. on terrorism 
charges. He has been fighting his extradition since then.

U.S.
 prosecutors told a British court hearing his extradition case two years
 ago that they plan to prove that Naseer collected bomb ingredients, 
conducted reconnaissance and communicated with al-Qaeda operatives.

The
 alleged activities were part of the foiled New York plot and another 
plot to bomb a shopping area in the northern English city of Manchester.

Naseer
 had been originally arrested on suspicion of terrorism in 2009. He was 
one of 12 men held in Manchester, but the men were later released 
because of a lack of evidence and a severely compromised investigation.

Naseer is expected to appear in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Monday.

The indictment came as part of a larger case involving three men from Queens - Najibullah Zazi, Adis Medunjanin and Zarein Ahmedzay - who were convicted of meeting with al-Qaeda operatives in Pakistan in September 2008 and returning to the United States and plotting to bomb New York subways.

Naseer is believed to have been in touch with the same senior al-Qaeda commanders.

The cases were linked by what court 
papers described as a common 'Qaeda facilitator' in Peshawar, Pakistan, 
who prosecutors said used the same e-mail account to send coded messages
 to Zazi in the U.S. and to Naseer in Britain.

Like the three men from Queens, Naseer spent time in Peshawar in late 2008.

Naseer, who originally came to Britain on a student visa, took his fight to remain in the UK to the European Court of Human Rights after exhausting his appeal options.

His extradition comes not long after the radical cleric Abu Hamza and four other suspects were deported to the US to face terrorism charges.
