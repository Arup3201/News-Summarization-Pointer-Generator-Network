A pageant winner living with diabetes has showed the world her insulin pump - and now wants others to show theirs. 

Sierra Sanderson won the title of Miss Idaho 2014 after she appeared on stage during the bathing suit portion of the competition in a bikini with her pump fully visible.

In a Facebook post, Sanderson asked other people to share images of themselves with pumps visible as part of the hashtag campaign ‪#‎showmeyourpump, KDVR notes.

'Honestly, it is terrifying walking out on stage in a swimsuit, let alone attached to a medical device,' she wrote.

'My message to everyone, diabetic or not, is that we all have something that doesn't "measure up" to the beauty standards set by the media -- and that is okay!'

Sanderson's post maintained the social media campaign 'is not limited to just girls, or to people with pumps -- I want to see YOU and whatever your daily battle with diabetes looks like.'

Over a hundred commenters have already commented on her Facebook post, many of them commending her for showing her pump during the beauty pageant.

On her blog, Sanderson wrote that '[The decision to wear a pump] took me two long years to make. When I first started competing, I was using injections rather than a pump.

'I didn’t want people to see a weird-tubey-machine-thing attached to me all the time, and could not wrap my head around having a medical device on my body for the rest of my life.'

Sanderson also wrote that 'her whole perspective changed' after learning that Miss America 1999 winner and fellow pump-wearer Nicole Johnson 'wore her pump while competing.'

She also wrote she was touched when Miss Idaho Outstanding Preteen McCall Salinas asked about her pump at the Miss Idaho competition.

'She shared
 with me that she had diabetes as well, but didn’t want a pump because 
of similar reasons I had had,'' Sanderson wrote. 'Through out the night,
 she stood backstage cheering me on. We bonded over diabetes and 
pageants, and by the end of the night, she told her mom she was ready to
 get a pump.

'It
 brought me to tears. The thought that I could be one person’s “Nicole 
Johnson” meant more to me than I can ever put into words.

Photos
 have since emerged showing both men and women, as well as children, who
 live with diabetes and showing their pumps to the world. Some of them 
have posed in swimsuits, like Sanderson, while others wear everyday 
outfits.

Twitter users have also positively written about Sanderson and her campaign for diabetes awareness.

One Twitter user wrote 'thank you Miss Idaho for being such an inspiration for type one diabetics!'

Another tweeted at Sanderson, 'Way to show the world that T1D doesn't have to stop you. It's hard to be brave.'

'You are an inspiration! So often we are self conscious of our pumps and scars. TY,' a user said.
