Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they were investigating the death of an officer in a 'horrific incident' but denied media reports it was an assassination.

Mojtaba Ahmadi, an official of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was found shot dead near Karaj, a town northwest of the capital Tehran, the Iranian website Alborz reported earlier this week.

He had left his house on Monday morning and was found a few hours later with a bullet in his heart, the website said.

The elite Revolutionary Guards have roughly 125,000 military personnel, including ground, aerospace and naval forces.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Ahmadi was a commander of the unit's Cyber War Headquarters and quoted a local police commander as saying it was an assassination.

The commander of the local police reportedly said two people on a motorbike had been involved in the assassination.

 'I could see two bullet wounds on his body and the extent of his injuries indicated that he had been assassinated from a close range with a pistol,' an eyewitness told the Alborz website.

The death has triggered further accusations that outside powers are carrying out targeted assassinations of key figures in the country’s security apparatus.

The Telegraph speculated that the death could have been an assassination, similar to those of five Iranian nuclear scientists since 2007.

'In the wake of a horrific incident involving one of the IRGC officials ... the matter is being investigated and the main reason of the event and the motive of the attacker has not been specified,' said an IRGC statement, quoted by Sepah news, Iran's military news.

Sepah, which is operated by the 
Revolutionary Guard, ran its report under the headline 'Denial of news 
reports of the assassination of one of IRGC's officials'.

The statement did not identify Ahmadi but a local news website published pictures on Wednesday showing his funeral procession, along with text excerpts of the IRGC communique.

'The result of investigation will be announced through official channels and any speculation will not be appropriate before the investigation is over,' an Iranian official said today.

Western officials have not commented on the incident.

Iran has been accused of mounting cyber attacks against Western targets in recent years, and has itself been the target of suspected U.S. attacks on computer systems at its nuclear facilities using a virus called Stuxnet.

For their part, authorities in Tehran have accused Israel and its Western allies of carrying out a series of assassinations against Iranian nuclear scientists. The last such attack happened in January 2012 when one man was killed by a car bomb.

Israel regards Iran's nuclear activities as an existential threat and has applied diplomatic pressure on the West to force Iran to curb its nuclear programme. Tehran maintains it has only peaceful goals.

Shashank Joshi, an expert at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told The Telegraph: 'Iran’s cyber attacks on Israel and elsewhere in the region are a rising threat and a growing threat, but it hasn’t yet been seen as a major and sustained onslaught.'
