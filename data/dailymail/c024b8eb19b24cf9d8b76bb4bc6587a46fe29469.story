A private security company criticised for the way it controls prisons and electronic tagging for criminals is facing substantial fines for causing lengthy delays in court cases.

Serco was hauled before a senior judge last week to apologise for ‘embarrassing’  hold-ups in bringing defendants up from the cells that have totalled ten hours.

On occasions, judge, jury and witnesses have been left waiting because guards insist on taking a full hour for lunch.

Serco also blundered by mixing up crucial legal papers and dumping them in bin liners, forcing the court to pay for lawyers to sort them out.

Serco was warned it faces being ordered to pay back at least £22,000 in barristers’ fees for wasted court time.

Barristers say the firm, which is paid £42 million a year by taxpayers to transport prisoners to court and bring people into the dock in the South East, does not employ enough staff.

The judge – who cannot be named because the trial is still ongoing – said: ‘I have never seen anything like what has gone on in this case since I came to the Bar 30 years ago.’

It is the latest in a series of blows to Serco’s reputation.  On Tuesday a report by  HM Inspectorate of Prisons found that Thameside jail in South London, managed by Serco, had been put in ‘lockdown’ because of gang violence between inmates.

On Friday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced  an emergency audit of the £107 million annual contract between Serco and G4S to provide electronic tags for offenders,  amid fears the firms may have overcharged the public purse.

Mark George QC, who acted in the Oxford grooming trial at the Old Bailey, said ‘It’s just chaos. We can’t have major trials being delayed just because of failings in the contract.’

Serco said: ‘We are committed to delivering a high level of service at the court.’
