A bar in Brixton has blamed rising violence in south London on black youngsters, claiming many clubs in the area have been forced out of business.

In a post on their Facebook page Fridge Bar, which is owned by a black woman, warned that unless young black people 'learn to conduct themselves in a civil manner' they face being barred from venues.

The post claims 13 clubs have closed 'in the past couple of years', because of violence.

The owner of Fridge Bar in Brixton has blamed violence in south London on black young people. She wrote in a post on Facebook, that 13 clubs in the capital have been forced to close as a result of the violence

The author of the post, who warned it was a 'controversial' message, said: 'The absolute majority of people who have disrupted theses venues are black men and increasingly some black women.

'There, I said it. It is true, I have witnessed it and there is both anecdotal and empirical evidence that what I say is true.

'I know some will say that it is a "minority" doing the damage but I disagree.

'The minority know that they have the support of the majority who fail to call them out when their behaviour becomes awful.'

It adds: 'It seems that the decent black people of whom there are many are losing the fight.

'We need to take back control and start to ostracise the b******s who are giving us all a terrible name.

The 300-capacity bar in Brixton Hill, which regularly hosts House, RnB and Disco nights, hit out at media reports covering the controversial post, in a second message on the social networking site.

The bar posted two messages on their Facebook page (pictured), the first blaming violence in south London on black young people, while the second responded to media coverage, revealing the owner of the bar is a black woman

The post said: 'A few days we put up a post highlighting the disproportionate incidences of trouble occurring in S London (sic) nightclubs and the fact that many have closed as a result.

'We deliberately and truthfully inserted our opinion backed by both anecdotal and empirical evidence that some black males and increasingly some black women are at the forefront of this.

'The media have quite mischievously and a tad maliciously tried to smear us.

'Clearly the fact that Fridge Bar is owned by a black woman has passed them by.'

The initial post has so far received 155 likes and attracted dozens of comments, many supporting the statement.

One reads: 'Yes people won't like it (the statement), but it's true.'

While another said: 'Do not apologie (sic) for speaking the absolute truth you are 100% right I agree with every word.'

The bar has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.
