Appearing to hover in midair, this is the astonishing moment a U.S. Special Forces Paratrooper was snapped throwing a salute to his comrades while jumping backwards out of a plane over Germany.

Despite being nearly 17,000ft in the air, the soldier, from the 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, appears completely unfazed as he leaves the C-130 Hercules aircraft.

The stunning photograph was captured during a training mission over a U.S. Special Forces Parachute Jump drop zone on February 24.

The 10th Special Forces group was founded in 1952 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, but was split in 1953 with one half being sent to Germany, while the other half folded into the 77th Special Forces Group.

The unit regularly takes part in training expercises with NATO allies in Europe, and has served in the Gulf wars, carried out humanitarian missions, and helped to train Middle Eastern forces. 

This is the astonishing moment a U.S. Special Forces solider appears to float in midair while saluting his colleagues while taking part in a training mission over Germany last month
