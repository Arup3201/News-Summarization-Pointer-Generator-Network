Now even Joe Hockey admits he blew it.

The Treasurer this afternoon publicly apologised for suggesting the 'poorest people don't have cars or actually don't drive very far'.

'I am really genuinely very sorry that there is any suggestion, any suggestion at all, that I or that government does not care for the disadvantaged in the community,' he said in a sympathetic interview with 2GB afternoon host Ben Fordham.

He decided to say sorry after a woman approached him in the street following a community event to tell him to 'show us what's in your heart'.

Apology: Joe Hockey, pictured in the studio prior to his interview with 2GB's Ben Fordham.

Education Minister Chris Pyne was asked six times during a television interview whether he supported Joe Hockey's controversial comments

The apology came after the Prime Minister distanced himself from Mr Hockey's comments at a press conference today. 'Plainly, I wouldn't say that,' he said.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne also declined to defend Joe Hockey on breakfast television despite six opportunities to do so.

Mr Hockey admitted on 2GB that the remarks were 'insensitive'.

'What was said can't be unsaid.'

'I can only apologise for any hurt that I've caused.'

He said he found the backlash 'upsetting' as he had fought his whole life for the disadvantaged.

In response, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten tweeted: 'It took @joehockey more than 48 hrs to realise how insulting his comments were. It took the rest of us four seconds.'

Earlier, Mr Pyne was asked whether he agreed with Joe Hockey's controversial comments when he appeared on the Today show with Shadow Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese.

Mr Pyne stated that the Treasurer had the government's 'full support' and that he wouldn't 'cop any criticism of Joe Hockey on these remarks'.

But when directly asked whether he supported Mr Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive' he refused to answer, instead repeating that Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job as Treasurer'.

Mr Albanese jumped in, pointing out Mr Pyne's refusal to back Mr Hockey's comments explicitly, telling the Education Minister: 'You had six opportunities to support what he said and you refuse to do so. Why? Because what he said was rubbish.'

'If you are in an outer suburb or a regional community you have no choice but to drive and this is the guy who cut all funding for public transport in the budgetâ€¦ and then he says that poor people don't have cars or don't drive very far,' Mr Albanese said.

'[Mr Hockey] should go to western Sydney today and have a look at people driving all the way in to the city, or all the way into their workplace in any capital city from the outer metropolitan areas, they spend a higher proportion of their income than high income earners.'

Mr Pyne said he thought Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job' as treasurer but refused to confirm whether or not he supported Joe Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive'

Joe Hockey has come under fire for his comments, which were made on ABC Radio as he was defending the government's proposed fuel excise

Mr Hockey has come under fire this week after remarking to ABC Radio on Wednesday that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households.

'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he said.

Mr Hockey made the controversial comments while defending the government's proposed fuel indexation, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who say it will hit low-income families the hardest.

The comments have caused widespread outrage, prompting Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to call Mr Hockey 'the cigar-chomping, Foghorn Leghorn of Australian politics', as well leading to criticism from Greens MPs, Coalition MPs and welfare groups.

NSW Nationals senator John Williams and Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald criticised Hockey's comments on the grounds that people in the bush need cars.

'You have to have a car whether you're rich or poor, you need a vehicle to be able to get from one place to the other,' Mr Macdonald told ABC Radio on Thursday.

'Regional Australians don't have the alternative of public transport of other means of getting there.'

Mr Hockey was also lambasted on social media with people using the hashtag #OtherThingsThePoorDontDo to poke fun at Mr Hockey's remark.
