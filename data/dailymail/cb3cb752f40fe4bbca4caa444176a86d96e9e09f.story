Miami has been crowned as the most festive city in the US, topping a top ten list of holiday locations which, surprisingly, features a large majority of other warm weather locations such as Texas, Georgia and North Carolina.

Despite the unlikelihood of enjoying a White Christmas in any of the five southern states featured on the list, online retailer Zulily has declared that it is the sunnier cities such as Austin, Raleigh and Tulsa which are ‘most ready for the 2014 holiday season’ because of the high numbers of festive purchases made in these locations.

Using information from its own customer database, the web-based company compiled a list of the top ten cities where the most Christmas-themed products, from tree ornaments to toys, were purchased and revealed that four of the top five festive cities are all located in the south of the country.

While Seattle, Washington, and Colorado Springs, Colorado, were ranked fifth and sixth respectively, Houston was ranked seventh, proving Texas has yuletide cheer to spare, with two cities on the list.

Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Las Vegas, Nevada, came in eighth and ninth, while Charlotte was ranked tenth, giving North Carolina its second spot on the list.

As well as seasonal items such as Christmas ornaments and baking sheets, the list also took into account the popularity of merchandise from the hit Disney film Frozen, deemed to be one of the hottest holiday items for kids this year.

In fact, Zulily’s findings also revealed the country’s top ten 'most Frozen crazed' cities, with Miami coming in at the top of that list too, followed by Colorado Springs; Portland, Oregon; Omaha, Nebraska; and Las Vegas.

During the past year, the website has sold more than 13,000 holiday ornaments in the US, as well as 6,000 baking sheets and a staggering one million Frozen-themed items.

Zulily's rankings also considered the number of shoes sold (more than eight million) - which it claims are enough to outfit the entire Nutcracker cast for 90,000 performances - and all 180,000 it has sold in 2014, which is enough to equip every Radio City Music Hall Rockette who has ever graced the iconic New York City stage, with 60 costume changes to spare.

Amy E. Goodman, Zulily's lifestyle editor, said that residents of the cities included on both lists started their shopping well before November.

'Even the earliest Black Friday sales aren’t soon enough for the cities on this list,' she said.

'This year’s top 10 started making holiday purchases well before the weather changed. The yuletide spirit has been strongest in the South, as Southern cities make up more than half the list.'
