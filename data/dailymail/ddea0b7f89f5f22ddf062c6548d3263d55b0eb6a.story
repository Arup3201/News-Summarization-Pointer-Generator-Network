Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack said Monday that the torso was dumped in water underneath a bridge

Police in Alabama have discovered a naked and headless torso a few miles from where a severed arm and hand were discovered on Sunday.

Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack said Monday that the torso of a white male was dumped south of Magnolia Springs in water underneath Weeks Creek Bridge, three miles east of where the other body parts were discovered.

He believes the remains belong to the same person and that they died in the last 72 hours.

He told Al.com: 'This is a homicide. We have no reason to expect anything else at this time.'

The only identifying feature so far is a tungsten ring found on the hand, the sheriff added.

The body was found by a local enjoying a walk Sunday morning.

Initially thinking it was an animal, they alerted authorities. The grim truth emerged later.

Police are searching with a three-mile radius.

The investigation will continue into the night because darkness is beneficial for certain types of forensic test. Police divers will also be used to scour the creek.

'There are chemical tests we'll conduct on the bridge tonight that are best done during darkness,' Mack said.

The hand and arm were discovered by a resident living near the Magnolia River.

Their dog pulled the arm from the river and the resident found the hand in a flower bed.

Baldwin County District Attorney Hallie Dixon, described the case as 'horrific'.

She added: 'Every murder is tragic. I've handled cases with newborn infants killed and I've seen a lot of bad stuff. This one is worse than most anything I've seen.'
