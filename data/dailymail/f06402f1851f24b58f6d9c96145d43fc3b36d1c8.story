Behind bars: Peter Mills was sentenced to 21 months for stealing £20,000 by hiding £50 notes in chocolate bar wrappers

A greedy thief used empty KitKat wrappers to smuggle £20,000 out of his workplace.

Peter Mills, 68, would eat the chocolate then fill the empty wrapper with wads of £50 notes that he stole from his employers Vaultex Ltd in Tonbridge, Kent.

He was caught on CCTV after his employers at the cash handling depot became suspicious. 

They discovered 97 incidents over 50 days of Mills hiding the money then concealing the wrappers on his body.

Suspicious staff searched him and found five £50 notes round a KitKat wrapper, famed for its slogan 'have a break, have a KitKat'.

Kent Police was called and further cash was found in Mills's car.

And when his locker was searched, police discovered a stash of empty KitKat wrappers inside.

Mills from Chatham, Kent, initially denied stealing the money during interviews with police, claiming  the money must have got caught up in the sweet wrappers by accident.

But he admitted four offences of theft at Maidstone Crown Court after bank statements revealed £30,000 in cash had been paid in over a four-month period from February to May 2014.

Prosecuter Mary Jacobson said: 'He surreptitiously put a bundle of notes into the wrapper.

'He would go off for a break and hide the wrapper in his trouser pocket before leaving the room.

'He would secrete it to remove it from the building at the end of the shift and this was a very consistent pattern that he continued.'

Mills, who started working for Vaultex Ltd in 2008, was given a 21 month prison sentence.

Judge Jeremy Carey said it was 'very serious offending'.

'You were tempted and you succumbed and that puts a very different complexion on this case,' he said.

'There is a very unattractive feature because you have done everything you can to reduce your culpability.

'It is said you did so because you were ashamed of what you had done.'
