A NSW father allegedly arranged an illegal marriage between his 12-year-old daughter and a 26-year-old man and gave her sexual advice including that she should have unprotected sex.

The 61-year-old father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'.

He appeared at Burwood Local Court via video link on Wednesday and has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14.

Escorted to court: A 26-year-old, pictured, faced Burwood Local Court on Wednesday after illegally marrying a girl who was 12 years old at the time of marriage in January

Cannot be identified: Since the illegal marriage, the 26-year-old man and the girl have engaged in sexual activities daily, as stated in court documents

The 26-year-old Lebanese man has since had his student visa cancelled and is in immigration detention after being charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 years.

Escorted by guards contracted by the immigration department, the man also appeared at Burwood Local Court on Wednesday.

Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 26-year-old University of Newcastle student at a mosque in November last year after he approached her father and asked to meet her.

Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony.

The father gave the girl sexual advice about contraception on the day of the wedding, according to court papers filed by police in support of an AVO application against the girl's father, The Daily Telegraph reported.

'The advice was that she should not use the contraceptive pill nor should (her husband) wear a condom when they have sexual intercourse,' the papers said.

It is alleged they were married in an Islamic ceremony in the living room in January this year.

The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege.

Cases adjourned: After appearing in court on Wednesday, both men had their cases adjourned until June, when they are expected to make a plea

A week after the wedding, he asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home.

He also asked the girl, now aged 13, if she needed to shower before morning prayer on one occasion, court documents show.

'The (girl) indicated that this is how the defendant would have known that (they) were engaged in sexual intercourse,' the papers claim. Islam requires people to shower after sex before they commence prayer, the girl allegedly told police.

The imam who performed the ceremony, Muhammad Riaz Tasawar, plead guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500 after.

Court documents state that since the marriage the pair have engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis.

'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the 26-year-old,' the police report states.

Both men had their cases adjourned until June 18, where they are expected to make a plea.
