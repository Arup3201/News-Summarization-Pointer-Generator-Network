A Sun City man accused in the shooting death of his 73-year-old wife -
 in what is being called a mercy killing - has been found dead in his 
car.

Howard Rudolph was found dead in his car after cutting off his ankle bracelet and going on the run from police

Howard Allen Rudolph, 79, went missing after cutting off his electronic monitoring ankle-bracelet Sunday and didn't appear for a court hearing Monday, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.

It has now been confirmed that 
Rudolph's body was found in his parked car in the northwest Valley on 
Tuesday, near 99th Ave and Beardsley.

The cause of death reportedly 
appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

'He was staying at some friends' homes,' Maricopa Co. Sheriff 
Joe Arpaio said.

'We're now investigating whether any friends were involved 
in his escape by helping him cut the monitor. He is somewhat frail, 79 
years old, so we're not sure if he did this on his own.'

Rudolph was arrested on August 7th and charged with second-degree murder in the death of Earlene Rudolph.

Sheriff's officials cited statements made by Rudolph about his wife 
being ill and what he wrote in a note found with a revolver at their home.

'I had to do it,' Rudolph told deputies after his arrest, according to court paperwork.

Investigators believe Rudolph intended to kill himself after allegedly killing his wife of 13 years.

They said Rudolph had written a note to his attorney containing specific
 instructions on how 'the bodies' should be cremated and how the 
couple's home should be handled.

Deputies went to the couple's house in the Phoenix-area retirement 
community after the Sheriff's Office received a hang-up 911 call from 
the home.

They say Rudolph made incriminating statements after deputies found 
Earlene Rudolph dead in a bathroom with what appeared to be multiple 
gunshot wounds.

Rudolph was released to the custody of his friends under electronic monitoring in February.
