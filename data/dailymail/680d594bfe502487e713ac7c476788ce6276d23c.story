A heartbroken husband is thought to have killed himself just hours after his wife died because he could not bear to carry on without her.

Adrian Cross, 45, was found dead at the couple’s home from a suspected overdose.

For nine months his wife Tammy, 37, had suffered from a debilitating lung condition, but lost her battle with the disease on October 8.

Devoted: Heartbroken Adrian Cross, 45, is thought to have killed himself just hours after his wife Tammy, 37, died because he could not bear to carry on without her. The couple, pictured on their wedding day in the Dominican Republic, were married for 15 years

She weighed only six stone when she died.

The couple, who married in the Dominican Republic 15 years ago before a second ceremony at home in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, were said to have been ‘in love from the day they met’.

Mrs Cross’s father, David Allan Jones, 65, said: ‘In all the years they were together, they had never spent a night apart. They were completely devoted to each other.

‘Their love was so strong that if they went out, they would write love notes to each other. We have found them all around the house.’

Couple: Adrian and Tammy Cross both died on October 8 after she had suffered from a lung disease

He
added: ‘I have never seen love like it and I don’t think I ever will 
again. Adrian always said that if anything ever happened to her he would
be straight behind her.’

Mrs Cross had four older siblings – brother Dean and sisters Dawn, Gail and Marie.

Her mother Phyllis Jones, 61, is divorced from Mr Jones but they remain close friends.

She said: ‘I know children love their mother but she was different. We called her angel.

‘You
can’t imagine losing your daughter before you. I don’t know how I am 
going to cope. Adrian was a son to us. He did everything for our Tammy. 
He looked after her and my family.’

Mrs Cross was said to be a popular face at Georgetown Fish Bar in Merthyr Tydfil where she worked. She later became a carer for her father, before falling ill herself.

Inseparable: Mr and Mrs Cross apparently fell in love when they met and never spent a night apart

Tragic: Mr Cross is believed to have taken an overdose shortly after the death of his beloved wife

On holiday: The couple used to leave love notes around the house for each other to find, according to relatives

Mrs Jones added: ‘Tammy was frightened and so ill but never broke down, she kept us upbeat.

‘She
was so strong … We were back and forth to the doctors with her. She had
a heart condition and it affected her lungs – she died in terrible 
pain.

‘I was so terrified for her but we didn’t know what to do to help.’

Mr Cross, who worked for Merthyr Tydfil council, was one of six children.

Illness: Mr Cross cared for Mrs Cross as she battled a lung condition for nine months before her death

Mourning: More than 1,000 well-wishers attended the funeral for the couple at a local church

His sister Yvonne Thornley, 57, said: ‘They were a devoted couple and just lived for one another.

‘It’s
very sad for all of us. They were both lovely people and we will miss 
them terribly. They were so in love from the day they met.’

More than 1,000 people attended the couple’s funeral at St John’s Church in Cefn Coed last Monday.

Mr and Mrs Cross’s niece, Sophie Jones, paid tribute to the pair on Facebook.

‘Really
don’t know how I’m going to get over the fact I won’t see you,’ she 
wrote. ‘Life is so cruel at times. I ask myself, why take the best.’

The coroner’s office yesterday confirmed it was waiting for toxicology reports before an inquest.
