QPR chairman Tony Fernandes took to Twitter to give his backing to under-fire boss Harry Redknapp on Saturday while revealing it was the Rangers boss and not him who paid the bill when the pair went for dinner on Friday night.

Redknapp, who maintains he feels under no pressure whatsoever despite the R's languishing at the bottom of the Premier League, suggested it would be Fernandes sorting out the bill during his pre-match press conference ahead of their meeting with Liverpool.

However, the R's chief posted a photo of him and Redknapp on Twitter to settle that debate, with the former Tottenham boss pictured holding the bill at the end of the night.

The QPR chairman says everyone at the club needs to stick together during the tough times

Fernandes said: 'Just to prove Harry paid for dinner last night haha good chat, poaitive (sic), We got to give it a go whatever the result.'

Rangers have won just once all season, that at home to Sunderland, but Fernandes maintains the R's have more than enough quality to turn their season around. 

Fernandes insists there is plenty of time for QPR to turn things around this season

Redknapp had suggested it would be Fernandes buying him dinner and not the other way round during his press conference on Friday

He added: 'We all stick together, unity is key, and get behind the boys tomorrow. We are QPR. Harry is up for it.

'We are in the best league in the world. We are seven games in. We are bottom. But not many points in it. We got good spirit in squad.'

Fernandes will be hoping that kind of spirit is shown in abundance on Sunday at Loftus Road as Rangers look to earn a first win in five league games.
