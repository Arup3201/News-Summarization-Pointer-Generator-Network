A bungling builder set fire to a row of terraced houses while fixing a leaking gutter with a blowtorch.

The workman was fixing the drainage system at a house in Westerleigh, Bristol, but accidentally set the roof on fire, which soon spread to the houses next door and destroyed everything inside them.

Heather Phelps, 44, came home from a shopping trip with her mother to find that her house was badly damaged and her possessions destroyed.

Lit up: A blaze broke out and within minutes the roof was on fire - which quickly spread to neighbouring homes

Blaze: The fire engulfed houses in Bristol after the workman's mistake while using hot bitumen and a blowtorch

begun

‘When I got back and saw what 
was happening I ran down the street screaming, with my mum in her 
wheelchair,’ the distraught mother said. ‘By the time I got to my house 
there was nothing left.’

Ms
Phelps, who had lived at the house for 19 years - with son Louis, 18, 
and partner Chris Harding, who recently moved in - added: ‘I’ve lost 
everything. I’m still in shock about what’s happened.’

Witnesses
said they saw the workman, sent by South Gloucestershire social housing
provider Merlin Housing Society, using hot bitumen and a blowtorch to 
reline the concrete guttering on the house.

Ms
Phelps will now have to be re-homed. Merlin Housing meanwhile is now 
investigating whether the subcontractors were following correct health 
and safety procedures during Friday’s incident.

Gutted: Properties in Westerleigh, Bristol, were destroyed after the fire caused by a workman on a roof

Emergency: Avon Fire and Rescue said it was 'satisfied' that an 'accidental ignition' by builders started the fire

Ms Phelps had been out shopping with her mother last Friday lunchtime when she got the call from next-door neighbour Belinda Standbridge, 45, urging her to get home.

Miss Standbridge - whose house was also badly damaged - had been in bed asleep for 20 minutes when the fire began, but she said her smoke alarms did not go off because they were faulty.

However Merlin Housing said the alarms in her home are mains wired, battery backed-up units that were installed in 2010 and found to be working perfectly when inspected this June.

Miss Standbridge said: ‘Luckily my neighbour Ashling (Bidwell) saw what was happening, found my daughter and she woke me up just in time. Our loft has been destroyed and I’ve lost a lot of family possessions. The rest of the house is badly smoke-damaged.’

The third house - now unliveable - is owned by an elderly woman who lives there with her son.

An Avon Fire and Rescue spokesman said an ‘accidental ignition’ by builders started the fire.

A Merlin Housing spokesman said: ‘Our understanding is that a sub-contractor of ours was carrying out repairs to the guttering of 4 Mill Crescent when the fire started and spread to Number 6.’

He added that Merlin Housing is investigating whether correct procedures were followed, and has visited local residents following the fire, offering to put them up in a hotel last weekend.

Last year: Five houses in Harwich were destroyed in the blaze which was started by a workman's blowtorch

This fire is the not the only recent incident of houses being burned by bungling builders.

Five
families were left homeless last December in Harwich, Essex, after a 
council worker's blowtorch apparently set fire to their houses.

The
tradesman working for the council was replacing a roof on one of the 
homes in the historic port town when the flame from his blowtorch set it
alight.

He was able to warn the family, who were in the house at the time, as the blaze quickly spread.

Seventy firefighters from across the county had to attend the fire, which moved quickly thanks to the wooden-framed buildings.
