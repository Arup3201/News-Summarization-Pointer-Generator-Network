Angela Merket was joined by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as more than a million people took to the streets to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.

A spectacular 15 kilometre-long string of 7,000 illuminated helium balloons traced the course of the barrier that once snaked through the city, cutting across streets, between families and even through graveyards.

They were set free one after another into the night sky, symbolising the breaching of the Wall by crowds of protesters in 1989 and the end of the Cold War.

Germans, whose national pride was shattered by Nazism, the Second World War and the Holocaust, have proudly focused on the peaceful East German revolution that felled the Wall as a crowning moment in their modern history.

Festivities to mark the anniversary drew more than one million Berliners and tourists to the heart of the once-divided city.

Earlier today German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the celebrations calling it an example of the human yearning for freedom.

Ms Merkel said the celebrations also honoured those who helped bring down the barrier that for 28 years symbolised the Cold War.

'The fall of the Wall has shown us that dreams can come true,' Ms Merkel said at the main memorial site for the Wall on Bernauer Strasse.

'Nothing has to stay the way it is, however big the hurdles are.

‘It showed that we have the power to shape our destiny and make things better,’ she said, noting that people in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and elsewhere around the world should feel heartened by the example of the Wall's sudden demise.

‘It was a victory of freedom over bondage.’

She also placed a flower in a crack in the wall, along with Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit.

The crowd also cheered when former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, widely admired in Germany for his role in paving the way for the Wall's collapse, stood and waved. He ominously warned in a speech in Berlin on Saturday that a new Cold War was looming over the Ukraine crisis.

The 83-year-old has accused the West, particularly the U.S. of giving in to 'triumphalism' after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the communist bloc a quarter century ago.

He warned: 'The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it's already begun.'

Failure to achieve security in Europe would make the continent irrelevant in world affairs, he added.

Elsewhere this evening, Peter Gabriel played a powerful rendition of ‘Heroes’ and several German artists performed on stage as well.

Despite the fog and cold, many wandered along the former ‘death strip’ where the Wall stood and where the illuminated helium balloons forming the ‘Lichtgrenze’, or Border of Light, were perched 3.6 metres (11.8 feet) high on poles matching the height of the barrier built in 1961 by Communist East Germany.

‘We're the happiest people in the world and we're thrilled that you brought the Berlin Wall down 25 years ago,’ Berlin's Mayor Klaus Wowereit said as the first balloons were sent aloft. ‘Nothing and no one can stand in the way of freedom.’

The anniversary of the Wall's fall was marked around the world. Pope Francis told tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square that it should spur people to try to topple other walls.

‘Where there is a wall, there is a closing of hearts. We need bridges, not walls,’ he said.

At least 138 people were killed trying to escape to West Berlin and many who were captured ended up in jail

The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to stop East Germans fleeing to the West. It began as a barbed wire and cinder block wall and was then fortified as a heavily guarded 160 km (100-mile) white concrete barrier that encircled West Berlin.

At least 138 people were killed trying to escape to West Berlin and many who were captured ended up in jail.

Communist regimes collapsed in the face of popular uprisings across Eastern Europe in 1989, signalling the end of the Cold War, of which the Berlin Wall had become the starkest symbol.

On the night of November 9, 1989, thousands of East Berliners streamed through the once-closed border crossings after communist authorities caved in to mounting pressure and relaxed travel restrictions that had prevented their citizens from going to the west for decades.

The fall of the Wall was the climax of weeks of popular protests spurred by changes that had already taken place elsewhere in eastern Europe.

Ms Merkel noted the important examples set by the democracy movements in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and praised East Germans who were inspired by them to stand up to the dictatorship.

Many young people who never experienced  life under the repressive East German regime also paid their respects

The fall of the Wall on November 9, 1989, was among the most powerful symbols of the revolutions that swept through the communist countries of Eastern Europe and heralded the end of the Cold War. Built by the communist authorities of East Germany in 1961, the Wall prevented East Germans from fleeing west and was equipped with guard towers and deadly traps

Tide of humanity: Confusion reigned when the East German government eased travel restrictions, but the fall happened largely without violence
