A passenger bus plunged from a 15-metre-high bridge in The Brazilian capital Rio de Janeiro yesterday killing at least seven people and closing the major thoroughfare where it landed.

Around 11 more people were injured in the accident, said Sergio Simoes, who heads Rio state's Civil Defense department, adding that number of injured was likely to rise.

Simoes said the dead were five men and two women.

He said it was unclear how many were aboard and whether any of the passengers were children.

Helicopter footage aired by Globo 
television network showed emergency response teams evacuating the 
injured from the overturned bus as rush-hour traffic stood at a 
standstill on Avenida Brasil, the highway that serves as the main 
entrance to Rio. Some of the injured were evacuated by helicopter.

The cause of the accident was not 
immediately known, but Globo cited eyewitness as saying that a dispute 
between a passenger and the driver might have helped spark the crash.

Buses are the main form of public 
transit in this city of 6 million, despite their sometimes questionable 
safety records and often uncomfortable overcrowding levels.

Rio's buses, operated by private 
companies, don't have seat belts, and it's not unusual for up to several
dozen people at a time to travel standing up. Rio's buses are also 
known for driving at high speeds, even in residential neighborhoods.

With two key metro stations closed 
pending the extension of Rio's subway, buses have taken on an even more 
crucial role in recent months and are the sole public transit option in 
poor neighborhoods ringing the city.
