Real Madrid talisman Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed he was the obvious choice after winning his second successive Ballon d’Or title earlier this month.

The 29-year-old beat Bayern Munich keeper Manuel Neuer and rival Lionel Messi to the prestigious award after a stellar 12 months with 56 goals in 51 Real Madrid games.

Ronaldo played an integral role for Los Blancos as they won four trophies in the 2014 calendar year, which included the Champions League, Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup.

He scored 17 goals as Real Madrid won the European Cup for the 10th time.

‘I think I deserved both. In 2014 the titles I earned may have weighed more heavily in the decision,’ said Ronaldo.

‘I won the Champions League, beat the scoring record for the year in this competition and all this has an obvious influence. But I deserved it last year too, given the amount of goals I scored.

‘The other two candidates this year, Messi and Neuer, were also great winners, but my victory is deserved. I was at a very good level.’
