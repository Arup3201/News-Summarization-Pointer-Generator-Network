More than 3,000 people may have been exposed to HIV after a Scots-based dentist contracted the infection.

Thousands of former patients of the dentist are being contacted by health chiefs warning them of the risk and offering them an HIV test.

Medical experts say there is a 'slight risk' that those treated by the individual may have been exposed to the virus.

The former dentist practised at Kelburne Dental Surgery in Paisley, Renfrewshire. Around 3,000 patients registered with the surgery have been treated by the dentist between January 2004 and March 2013

The former dentist practised at Kelburne Dental Surgery in Paisley, Renfrewshire, until March this year.

Approximately 3,000 NHS and private patients registered with the surgery have been treated by the dentist at some point between January 2004 and March 2013.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have contacted the vast majority by letter however there are around 250 NHS patients and 230 private patients who we have been unable to trace.

The former dentist also provided locum Sunday Emergency Dental cover at Nithbank Hospital, Dumfries between April 2004 and 2007.

It is thought 247 patients may have received treatment from this dentist during this time.

NHS Dumfries and Galloway has identified and written to most of the patients involved, however 14 patients no longer reside in the region and it has not been possible to trace them.

A confidential helpline has been set up to offer advice to patients who may have been treated by the dentist.

Dr Syed Ahmed, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Consultant in Public Health Medicine, said: 'It is very rare for HIV to be passed from a health care practitioner to a patient because all work follows strict 'infection control' measures.

'These measures are designed to prevent infections like HIV being passed between people and through our investigations into this case we are confident that all appropriate infection control measures were followed by the dentist.

'Whilst we therefore think the risk is extremely low we cannot guarantee that there is no risk, so we have set up a freephone help-line where patients can ask questions and then decide if they want to have an HIV test.

'If anyone has been treated at the Kelburne Dental Surgery and has not received a letter but has concerns we would ask them to call the helpline number and we will be able to check their name against the list of individuals who we have been unable to trace.'

Dr Derek Cox, Director of Public Health, NHS Dumfries and Galloway, said: "We have identified that 247 patients were treated by this dentist.

Of these we are unable to find addresses for 14, almost certainly because they no longer live in Dumfries and Galloway.

'If you were seen at a Sunday Emergency Dental clinic at Nithbank between April 2004 and April 2007 and have not yet received a letter, it is unlikely that you were treated by the dentist in question. 

'Nevertheless, if you are concerned that you may have been missed off the list please contact the helpline."

In the last 25 years, 30 practising health care practitioners have contracted HIV leading to similar patient alerts.

Around 10,000 people have been tested as a result and not a single person was found to have caught HIV as a result of medical or dental treatment.

Last week, the government announced it is to lift a ban that stops healthcare staff with HIV performing certain medical procedures.

Healthcare staff in England, Wales and Scotland having HIV treatment will be able to take part in all tasks, including surgery and dentistry.

The confidential free phone helpline - 0800 028 2816 - will be open daily from 8am to 10pm until Sunday 1st September 2013.
