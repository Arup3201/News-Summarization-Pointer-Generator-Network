A dwarf died after his friend spiked his beer with 27 anti-depressant tablets for 'a joke' which went wrong, a court heard.

Lee Webster, 26, is accused of slipping the 30mg Mirtazapine tablets into Jason Wood's can while he left the room to go to the toilet.

Mr Wood, 30, who was four foot tall, came back and remarked 'my beer tastes funny' but Webster told him to 'just drink it' and three hours later he was dead, the jury was told.

'Joke gone wrong': Jason Wood, 30, died after his beer was spiked with 27 anti-depressant tablets, a court was told

He was found slumped in an armchair at the house in Ramsgate, Kent, by friend Ian Sherringham who tried in vain to revive him.

Maidstone Crown Court heard that Webster 
kept quiet about what he had done until a month later when he confessed that he had spiked the drink.

'Victim': Mr Wood, 30, was discovered dead in a chair at the property in Ramsgate, Kent

He told his father Stephen Allen he had put the tablets in Mr Wood's beer and ‘may have accidentally killed him’.

And the Crown claims he told his sister Stephanie he had spiked the drink because he ‘thought it would be a laugh’.

The court also heard that Mr Wood's sister Tracey, 38, befriended Webster on Facebook and he told her: 'Tracey, I am so sorry. I put 27 of my mirtazapine tablets into Jason’s beer that night.'

A post-mortem found that the victim, 
who weighed just six stone, had consumed an amount of mirtazapine that 
had proved fatal in others.

Anthony Haycroft, prosecuting, said: 'He (Webster) accepted putting the pills into Jason’s beer. He said it was done as a joke.

'There
is no suggestion he did anything intending to kill Jason. It may well 
have been done as a joke but we have to look at the consequences of 
that.'

Oliver Saxby QC, 
defending, said: 'It was pretty obvious it was a stupid thing to do. 
They were friends, they were good mates. He didn’t intend to cause harm.
Some hours later the friend was found dead.'

However,
the defence barrister said the critical question for the jury was 
whether the tablets were the cause of Mr Wood's death.

Mr Saxby added: 'He (the defendant) can’t help you with that, so you won’t be hearing from him. You won’t be deprived of hearing what he has said about what he has done.

'It is not a question of gagging him. It is simply how can he assist with this crucial question?

'Questions to be answered were how toxic the drug was and could a person be given 27 of the tablets and survive?

'Or is it the case if you are given them you are likely to die? I think we will hear that is not the case.'

Mr Saxby said it was possible to die from the amount of alcohol Mr Wood had in his system.

Death: Mr Wood was drinking with friends in this house in Ramsgate, Kent, when he allegedly had the anti-depressant tablets slipped into his beer

He said it was possible he could have died from a combination of sleep apnoea and too much alcohol.

He added: 'If that is correct, the Crown may be in difficulty in proving that mirtazapine played a requisite part in his death.'

Mr
Wood was confirmed dead at a house in Ramsgate, Kent, where he had gone 
to drink with friends Webster, Steve McNamara and Ian Sherringham who 
lived there.

Mr Sherringham said Mr Wood, Mr Webster and a friend called Steven McNamara had been drinking strong lager and cider on the night in question.

He
went back on October 22 and saw Mr Wood was lying in an armchair with 
his head back and appeared to be asleep. There were a lot of empty beer 
cans.

Mr Sherringham said: 'I didn’t wake him as when he is awoken after drinking he gets annoyed.

'I went downstairs and fed the dog and
watched TV. I thought something wasn’t right because Jason wasn’t 
snoring and he does quite loudly. I touched his hand. It was cold, like 
being in the freezer.'

Accused: Webster, 26, who is standing trial at Maidstone Crown Court, is accused of manslaughter and also faces an alternative charge of administering poison or noxious substance as to endanger life

Mr Sherringham said he called his ex-girlfriend and Mr Wood’s sister Tracey West and she told him to splash water over his face.

Nothing happened, so he threw all the water over him.

He called for an ambulance and was told to try CPR on Mr Wood. He did so until paramedics arrived, but Mr Wood was later pronounced dead.

Mr Sherringham said he received a message form Webster on Facebook saying: 'I am sorry, I gave Jason 27 tablets in his beer.'

Webster asked him on the telephone what he should do and Mr Sherringham said he told him he should hand himself in, the court heard.

Webster, from Gravesend, Kent, is accused of manslaughter and also faces an alternative charge of administering poison or 
noxious substance as to endanger life. He denies the charges.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
