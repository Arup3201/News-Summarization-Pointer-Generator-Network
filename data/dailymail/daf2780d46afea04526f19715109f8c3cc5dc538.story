A group of fired McDonald's workers claim supervisors repeatedly complained that 'there were too many black people in the store'.

They are suing the fast-food giant in the United States for alleged racial discrimination and sexual harassment after they were fired from several restaurants in Virginia.

According to the civil rights complaint filed on Thursday, workers at franchised restaurants in the southern state of Virginia were allegedly 'subjected to rampant racial and sexual harassment, committed by the restaurants' highest-ranking supervisors.'

The lawsuit has potentially broad implications because it contends that McDonald's is responsible for the well-being of workers at all its restaurants, even if they are franchises.

The plaintiffs - of which, nine are black and one is Hispanic - allege they were fired because the restaurant, operated by a company called Soweva, wanted to 'reduce the number of African-American employees and hire more white employees'.

The lawsuit continues: 'Soweva's supervisors were blunt, telling employees that it was "too dark" in the restaurants, and that they were going to hire different workers because they "need to get the ghetto out of the store".'
