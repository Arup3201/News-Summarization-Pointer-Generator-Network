The company behind plans for a new high-speed rail link has been accused of using ‘strong arm tactics’ to stop people from raising their objections to the £50 billion HS2 project.

Residents who fear their communities will be blighted by the planned 225mph rail line say they were visited at home by groups of HS2 officials and urged not to give evidence to a powerful parliamentary committee which can order major changes to the scheme.

The visits came after they submitted petitions to the HS2 Select Committee, which led them to be targeted by HS2 Ltd – the Government-funded company behind the scheme.

Objection: Gill Stockdale was visited at home by HS2 Ltd staff, who told her: 'We want to buy you off'

HS2 Ltd’s strategy has come to light after grandmother Gill Stockdale, 66, appeared before the committee and revealed how four officials had tried to strike a deal with her in her living room after she raised objections about construction site lorries travelling outside the primary school attended by her granddaughter. 

She said David McCann, an HS2 Ltd engineer, told her: ‘We want to buy you off to prevent you from appearing before the Select Committee and will continue trying to do so right up to the doors of Committee Room 5 [where the hearings are being held].’

Mrs Stockdale said that rather than money, HS2 Ltd had offered a pedestrian crossing near the primary school in the village of Hill Ridware, Staffordshire, close to where the first phase of the HS2 line will end. 

She said: ‘They stated their intention clearly – they just wanted to shut me up.’

The cross-party High Speed Rail Bill Committee has received almost 2,000 petitions against HS2 and has started hearing each case in turn.

It has the power to order costly alterations to the proposed route, further tunnelling and noise prevention barriers. 

Thirty-seven objectors have so far appeared before the committee. However, a further 32 people due to give evidence have suddenly withdrawn their opposition or failed to show up on their allotted day.

Derek Silverwood, 79, who runs a nature reserve for a society for the disabled in Handsacre, said he was also visited by Mr McCann, petitions manager Miss Benson and two other HS2 Ltd officials.

He said: ‘Having talked all around my petition, Daisy Benson suddenly said, “Are you sure you still want to go ahead?” I told them nothing would stop me as I was going to say my piece no matter what.

‘I got the distinct impression they would have been cock-a-hoop if I suddenly said I wouldn’t be going to London. It feels like they are trying to reduce the number of petitions the committee has to consider.’

HS2 last night denied any wrongdoing in its dealings with objectors. 

A spokesman said: ‘We do not seek in any way to curtail people’s right to appear before the Commons Committee. HS2 Ltd is seeking to resolve people’s concerns before they go to Parliament.’

Sir Peter Bottomley, a Conservative MP on the HS2 Select Committee, said he was not aware of any intimidation tactics and said the negotiations appeared ‘perfectly normal’.

He added: ‘If they can reach a satisfactory agreement which is fair to the public purse and to the petitioner, that’s fine.’
