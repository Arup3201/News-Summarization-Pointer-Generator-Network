The farce over WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange may already have left taxpayers with a bill of £1million, it emerged last night.

The staggering total is made up of legal, policing and court costs run up over two years as he fought extradition to Sweden over rape allegations.

The 41-year-old Australian was granted asylum by Ecuador on Thursday and is holed up in the country’s embassy in Knightsbridge, central London.

He took his case all the way to the Supreme Court in an effort to dodge justice, but it ruled he could be extradited.

He entered the embassy while out on 
bail and the total cost of his case is expected to hit millions after it
was announced he will now take it to the International Court of Justice
in the Hague.

Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, said Britain was obliged under international law to allow his client safe passage to Ecuador.

He said: ‘We will go before the 
International Court of Justice to demand that Britain complies with its 
obligations because there is a person who runs the risk of being 
persecuted politically.’

A victory for Assange would put 
ministers in the difficult position of facing the humiliation of letting
him leave or defying the court.

In the meantime, Assange appeared set 
on rubbing the Government’s nose in its continued failure to arrest him.
Police have been ordered to beef up their presence outside the 
Ecuadorian embassy tomorrow ahead of what diplomats described as a 
‘media stunt’.

A source said: ‘We’re expecting [his lawyer] to appear with a TV screen so Assange can launch some sort of bizarre statement.’

Yesterday the extensive security 
operation remained in place. Some 50 police officers are involved at any
one time and it is thought to be costing around £50,000 a day. Security
sources said Assange would be arrested and deported if he put ‘one toe’
outside the embassy.

Police positioned inside the building 
housing it – shared with the Colombian embassy – will seize Assange if 
he crosses the threshold and gives up diplomatic protection.

One Whitehall source said: ‘If he should leave the territory of the embassy he will be arrested.’

Police also have access to the common parts of the building which are not Ecuadorian territory.

Another security official said: ‘If he puts one toe into the corridor police are under orders to take him.’

Diplomats who had to take back their 
threat to ‘storm’ the embassy and withdraw its diplomatic status are 
seeking support from allies at the UN, urging them to pressure the 
Ecuadorians.

Ecuador has also launched its own 
diplomatic campaign, calling a meeting of the Organisation of American 
States for emergency talks.

Discussions between the country’s 
female ambassador, Ana Alban Mora, and Foreign Office officials earlier 
this week were described as ‘cordial and constructive’, however.

A diplomatic bag similar to the type that could be used to smuggle Mr Assange into south America. His would, of course, have Ecuadorian markings and not U.S.

The saga began in late 2010 when 
Sweden issued a demand for Assange to face questioning over allegations 
of rape and sexual assault made by two WikiLeaks supporters, which he 
denies.

Since then he has spent more than a 
full working week in court fighting against extradition there. Every 
minute of a high-profile court case costs £100 in general courtroom 
costs.

In addition, the Crown Prosecution Service has been working on 
behalf of the Swedish authorities and absorbing the cost as part of a 
mutual aid agreement.

Yesterday the CPS said it had spent 
£61,269 on external lawyers but its full bill – including the costs of 
its own lawyers and administration – will be much higher.

Lawyers for Assange’s alleged victims said their voices had been lost amid the furore.

Claes Borgstrom, lawyer for the two 
women, said: ‘Julian Assange himself is very clever to move focus from 
what he has actually suspected of having done to something that is 
completely different.’
