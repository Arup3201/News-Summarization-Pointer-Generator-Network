Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush claimed in remarks to religious conservatives on Friday that immigrants are 'more fertile' than American-born women, which he argued would help the economy by creating more taxpayers to pay off government debt.

'Immigrants are more fertile, and 
they love families, and they have more intact families, and they bring a
 younger population,' he added. 'Immigrants create an engine of economic
 prosperity.'

Bush, who is thought to be weighing a presidential bid, explained that a growing population of young workers could help the government fund its safety net for the retiring baby boomer generation.

'Demography is destiny,' he said. 'Ten years from now we will all hopefully be 10 years older. That's my plan and I hope it is yours as well. If that's the case, then we are going to have fewer workers taking care of a larger number of people that the government has a social contract with.

'We cannot do that with the fertility rates we have in our country,' he added. 'We are barely breaking even.'

Bush, the brother to former president George W. Bush, is among several potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual conference in Washington.

As Congress debates changing the nation's immigration laws, many conservatives are reluctant to support a new system that grants so-called 'amnesty' to millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

Before being granted legal status, Bush 
said, they should pay a fine, learn English and be blocked from 
receiving welfare benefits.

He said the nation must allow more immigrants 'to pursue their dreams in our country with a vengeance to create more opportunities for all of us.'

'If we don't do it, we will be in decline,' he told evangelical Christian activists.

Perhaps what Bush meant to say, as NBC points out, is that immigrants on average have more children than American-born women.

According to 2011 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, the fertility rate for foreign-born women is 87.8 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, compared to the rate of 58.9 births per 1,000 American-born women in the same age group.

Also pushing conservatives to embrace
 immigrants at the event Friday was Sam Rodriguez, president of the 
National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.

Rodriguez told the crowd, 'I know you
 are hearing a lot recently about whether or not these 11 million 
individuals become legal, that these are 11 million voters that 
automatically vote for a democrat or a liberal.

'Don't drink the Koolaid!' he said. 
'How do I know that? Because seven out of 10 individuals, that come to 
Christ, that have a religious conversion experience to Christianity in 
America today, our are of Hispanic descent.

'We have to put some salsa sauce on the top of the conservative movement!'

Bush spoke to the conference one day after holding a closed-door meeting on immigration reform with House Republicans.

'The House Republicans have a really critical role to play in this,' Bush told reporters after the meeting Thursday. 'I talked about the possibility of reframing the conversation about how economic growth matters to everybody and everybody benefits from it.'

Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour backed up Bush's argument at a separate meeting at the Bipartisan Policy Center alongside the former Florida governor.

'GDP growth is simply productivity multiplied by the number of workers,' Barbour said. 'Now I wasn’t a math major, but I can figure out that if the number of workers stays the same as it has under this administration… it’s very hard to get the GDP to go up.'
