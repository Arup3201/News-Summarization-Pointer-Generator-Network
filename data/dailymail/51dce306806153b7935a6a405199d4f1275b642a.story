Tragedy: 24-year-old outdoorsman Dasan Marshall died on Sunday after falling 1,000 feet off an Alaskan mountain

A 24-year-old experienced mountaineer died Sunday while attempting to climb a peak in Alaska's Chugach Mountain range. 

Alaskan authorities say Dasan Marshall of Portland, Oregon was climbing Mount Yukla with a friend Sunday afternoon when he fell about 1,000 feet and died.

Rescuers received a call about Marshall around 2pm, and used a helicopter to retrieve the body which was taken to the state medical examiner's office.

Marshall's next of kin have been informed and investigators say they do not suspect foul play in the accident.

According to Alaska Native News, Marshall had enrolled in a class in Alaska Pacific University's outdoors program, where he regularly climbed mountains, waterfall ice, and rock formations.

At 7,535 feet, Mount Yukla is not  exceptionally tall, but is described on climbing website the Mountain Project as 'one of the gnarliest peaks in the Chugach'.

'While its elevation isn't anything to squawk about by Alaska standards, Yukla is a beast of (a) mountain,' one climber wrote. 'The northern side has well over 4,000 feet of elevation gain.'

No further details on the incident are being released until after the Monday Martin Luther King Jr holiday.

Following news of Marshall's death, several of his friends in the mountaineering community wrote touching tributes to their fallen fellow outdoorsman. 

Friend Simon Frez-Albrecht wrote on Facebook that Marshall was the person who first got him excited about climbing. 

'Dasan always dreamed big. His enthusiasm was infectious. He loved climbing and sharing that love with others. 

Accident: Alaskan authorities notified Marshall's family and said they don't believe foul play was a factor in his death. Above, Marshall pictured on the left with a woman in a photo posted to his Facebook page

'But he loved many other things as well, and in remembering him I don't want to neglect those. He practiced many disciplines apart from climbing, including woodcarving and creating art through other media. 

'Dasan was loving and caring toward everyone in his life, giving generously of his time and thoughts...My written words are inadequate for expressing how much I will miss him,' Frez-Albrecht wrote. 

Commenting on a KTVA story about Marshall's death, family friend Michael Cromie wrote: ' Dasan was a vibrant young man and a dear friend. His deep connection to the natural world guided his experience. He was a true explorer. I am deeply saddened.'  

Lost: Several of Marshall's friends posted touching tributes to him online Monday, when news of his premature death broke. Pictured camping in this shot posted to his Facebook
