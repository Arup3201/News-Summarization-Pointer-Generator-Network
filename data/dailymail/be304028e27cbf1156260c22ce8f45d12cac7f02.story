An Illinois congressman already under intense scrutiny for spending $40,000 redecorating his office like Downton Abbey is embroiled in yet another controversy after it emerged he spent $10,000 of taxpayers' money to have his staff accompany him on a trip to New York.

The spending habits of U.S. Republican Aaron Schock have been widely scrutinized after he used $40,000 in taxpayer funds to redecorate his Washington office in the style of the Downton Abbey television show.

Now it has been claimed he spent $10,000 taking 10 staff members on a trip to New York to coincide with a U.S. visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In the latest development, The Chicago Sun-Times reported that the Schock staffers did almost no government work there and House disbursement records show he received the $10,053 for 'travel subsistence' between September 26 and 29. The events with the Indian prime minister were September 27 and 28.

And about 20 tickets to a Global Citizen Festival concert - where performers included Jay Z and Carrie Underwood - were purchased using $3,000 from a Schock campaign fund.

Schock, at an event Monday in Chicago, told reporters the New York trip was official business and he was honored his staff could attend.

Schock said about a dozen world leaders including President Barack Obama spoke.

His spokesman has said that Schock wanted to play a 'constructive role' in Modi's visit to further economic ties between the U.S. and India.

'It was a very legitimate trip on official business,' he told reporters. 'I'm glad that I played such a significant role in it. And I'm honored that my staff was able to be there with me as well.'

Schock would not address questions about why he took so many staff members.

Other Illinois congressmen made the same trip but without staff members and some paid for the trip out of personal funds.

Schock's financial charges have been made public after organizations questioned what his expenses were going toward. He has spent thousands on concerts and car mileage reimbursements 

Schock yesterday also defended his frequent Illinois travel as his way of reaching constituents.

He noted that his central Illinois district is geographically expansive, including parts of Peoria, Bloomington and Springfield, and says he has fewer district offices than other congress members.

'Some people spend more on direct mail pieces that they send out,' he told reporters. 'I spend more to get around my district.' 

Last month the Associated Press identified at least a dozen flights worth more than $40,000 on aircraft belonging to Schock's donors since mid-2011.

Beyond air travel, Schock spent thousands more on tickets for concerts, car mileage reimbursements - among the highest in Congress.

Other official expenses that have been made by Schock include taking interns to a sold-out Katy Perry show last year and a Bears game.

Schock has said that he's hired a firm to review his spending. He's reimbursed the government $40,000 for the office decorations and $1,200 for the Bears game flight.
