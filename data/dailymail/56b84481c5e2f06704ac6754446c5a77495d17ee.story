These 11 fugitives suspected of committing crimes including drug smuggling, fraud and rape in Britain are thought to have fled to Cyprus to hide from police.

Among the most wanted is Jeffrey Bloor, 41, from Brighton, East Sussex, who is wanted by Sussex Police over an alleged horse racing betting and blood stocks scam, where would-be investors were duped out of millions of pounds.

Cypriot Costas Sampson, 23, who also spells his first name with a K and was last known to be living in London, is also wanted by Scotland Yard after he was convicted of rape, voyeurism and theft in August 2012.

The most wanted list has been released by Crimestoppers and the UK's National Crime Agency and includes: (from left to right) Richard Ardolino, Jeffrey Bloor and Timur Mehmet

It is hoped the list will help find the suspects and flush them out of Cyprus where they are though to hiding. The list also includes: (from left to right) Christakis Philippou, Ersin Mustafa and Costas Sampson

Operation Zygos is the second of its kind targeting Cyprus and includes six new suspects along with five remaining fugitives. On the list are: (from left to right) Mehmet Salih, Martin Evans and Ozgur Demir

Two years earlier he raped a girl who was taken ill after accepting a drink from a stranger at a London nightclub, and stole valuables from her flat after the attack.

Another fugitive is Christakis Philippou, 70, also known as Christakis Chrysostomou, who is wanted by the Metropolitan Police after he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud.

Between 2004 and 2006 he was involved in scams where at least 20,000 unwitting customers were offered cheap holidays, only for the travel agency to stop trading, leaving victims without a trip.

The most wanted list has been published by Crimestoppers and the UK’s National Crime Agency as part of a hunt to flush the suspects out of their hiding places.

The appeal, called Operation Zygos, is the second of its kind targeting Cyprus and includes six new suspects along with five remaining fugitives who featured in the last campaign.

It aims to find criminals who could be in the Republic of Cyprus or Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus.

Anyone with information about any of the suspects is urged to contact Crimestoppers anonymously to help police find the likes of Hasan Akarcay (left) and Osman Aydeniz (right)

Steve Bennett, the NCA’s head of European operations, said: ‘Fugitives don’t just give up their criminal behaviour, they typically remain part of the criminal world, creating harm and causing damage, sometimes to the new communities they live in.

‘We are determined to ensure life on the run is intolerable for them and that they are brought back to face justice.

‘The most important thing is the power of this campaign to harness the eyes and ears of the public, both in Cyprus and the UK.

‘If you have information on the whereabouts of our targets, no matter how small or trivial it seems, call Crimestoppers anonymously and let us know.’
