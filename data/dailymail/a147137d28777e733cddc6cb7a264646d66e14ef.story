He probably wished he just chewed his arm off.

A drunk 41-year-old man has been left red-faced after calling police to remove his snoring sex partner from his Wisconsin apartment.

Benjamin Todd Duddles dialed 911 about 4.20am Sunday to say he wanted 'a female removed from his bed', adding he wasn't sure 'how she got into his apartment'.

He then changed his story, saying he let her into his White Rock Ave, Waukesha, unit and she 'just went into his bed and fell asleep'.Â

Duddles complained the unidentified woman was 'now snoring like a train and he wants her out', The Smoking Gun reported.

However when cops arrived, Duddles revealed the pair 'drank together, had relations and she fell asleep'.

But when he couldn't rouse the slumbering woman, he called police, according to a Waukesha Police Department report.

His unidentified lover was 'found to be fine medically, just has sleep apnea'.

Police suggested Duddles sleep on the couch after reminding him that a snoring woman was not a police matter. He wasn't arrested.
