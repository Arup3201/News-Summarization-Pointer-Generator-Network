The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday urged David Cameron to raise the amount of taxpayers' money spent in development aid to poor countries.

The Most Reverent Justin Welby called on the Prime Minister and other national leaders to stick to their pledge to increase aid because 'development is working'.

Dr Welby said numbers living in extreme poverty in the world had halved since 1990 and said more could be done, 'but only if governments do not waver from the moral and political commitments that they made more than a decade ago.'

The Most Rev and Rt Hon Justin Welby, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury has asked Cameron to invest more in foreign aid

Mr Cameron has promised to raise British
aid spending to 0.7 per cent of national income in line with 
'Millennium Goal' targets set by the United Nations. At present spending
is around 0.56 per cent, about £9 billion a year.

The Coalition promises to hit the target figure next year, a pledge which will take British aid spending over the £10 billion mark.

The Prime Minister is under pressure from backbench critics to cut aid on the grounds that most of it is wasted, abused or sucked up by corrupt regimes, and developing countries are better helped by growing trade.

The Archbishop, who made his call in a letter to the Financial Times together with a group of other religious leaders, said financial crisis was not an excuse for cutting aid and governments should 'fulfil existing commitments to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid.' Dr Welby's letter was also backed by the leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols, other Christian and Islamic figureheads, together with Hindu, Jewish and Sikh leaders, and spokesmen from more minor faiths.

The letter said leaders of the G8 group of the wealthiest countries should stick to the UN targets, which are supposed to be met by 2015.

'Development is working. But challenges remain,' the leaders said. 'The number of people living in extreme poverty has been halved ahead of time and 14,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990.

'Yet one in eight people still goes to bed hungry every night and more than two million die of malnutrition every year.' Dr Welby and his fellow leaders added: 'The financial crisis may be a reason but is not an excuse for deferral.

MP Douglas Carswell dopes not believe that improvements in developing countries are down to foreign aid from the west

'In addition to providing for the wellbeing of our own societies, we have a collective responsibility to uphold human dignity and the common good at the global level.' The letter said G8 countries should co-operate to stop untaxed wealth being hidden and to encourage more open finances in developing countries.

However the claim that development aid has been responsible for reducing poverty over the past two decades met a scathing response from economists and Tory MPs, who said economic growth in China, the Far East, India, Africa and Latin America has been the overwhelming reason why people are better off.

Tory MP for Clacton Douglas Carswell said: 'I grew up in one of the poorest countries on the planet, where my parents worked as doctors in a mission hospital. I can tell you the improvement in living standards in Uganda and Africa has not been brought about by aid.

'Development aid is a government-to-government subsidy that has only encouraged corruption. Uganda and Africa have improved because Africans are joining the global marketplace, because of the impact of individual donors like Bill Gates, and because of new technology.'

Economist Ruth Lea of the Arbuthnot Banking Group said: 'Aid is of residual importance, to be kind to it. What has brought people out of poverty is economic growth.

'It has not been aid that has taken people out of poverty in China and India, and what governments really need to do get rid of poverty is to adopt pro-growth policies.'
