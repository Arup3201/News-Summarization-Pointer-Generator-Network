Alan Howells caught a 2ft  rat at his Swindon home

A grandfather was forced to set a trap to catch a 2ft long super rat that had been plaguing his home as experts have warned of a new army of rats that are immune to most poisons. 

Alan Howells took action after he found a rat leaving droppings and scurrying around his Swindon home, as the town struggles with a growing number of the pests. 

The pensioner's plight comes as experts have warned about the danger of populations of super rats emerging in England as local authorities slash their pest control budgets. 

Mr Howells, 76, used a trap and cat food to snare the rat, measuring around 12 inches long. 

'I couldn't believe the size of it,' he said. 

'We are bird lovers and have lots of things hanging out in the garden as feeders, so we thought that might have been attracting them.

'The other day we saw one climb up the bird feeder and start eating the food.

'We have been wondering how it got in, and there is a window with the white guttering outside which has a gap in it.

'The concrete had been chewed, so we reckon it either got in there or got in the back way where the lead flashing in the roof had been lifted up.'

The pensioner has found other rodents in the house he shares with his wife Maureen since, but nothing as big as this rat. 

Last week pest control expert Justin Holloway, of Prokill, warned people about the danger of the emergence of pesticide-resistant super-rats after he found a 20-inch rodent in the yard of a restaurant.

He said: 'As far as resistance to poison is concerned it is a growing issue, and over a period of time I expect this to be a greater problem than it currently is.'  

Across 200 local authorities in England, pest control budgets have been cut by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010. This means more people have taken to removing vermin themselves - which can make the problem even worse.

Two rats, measuring around 2ft long, were found in Liverpool as clusters of super rats were found in the UK

David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: 'Any reduction in pest control budgets is potentially going to result in more people attempting DIY solutions.

The figures were released by Labour and also found that budgets for street cleaning had been slashed by around 16 per cent. 

Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that some rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poison - with vermin tested in Wiltshire, Hampshire and Kent having immunity. 

Last year a number of parts of England reported an increase in the number of large 'super rats', with large vermin reported in Liverpool and Kent. In Liverpool two large two foot long rats were found and experts warned the number of rats was likely to outnumber humans by two to one. 

The find comes as experts have warned of emerging populations of 'super rats', immune to normal poisons
