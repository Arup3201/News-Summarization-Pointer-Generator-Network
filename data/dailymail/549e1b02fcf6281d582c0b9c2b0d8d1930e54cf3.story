A JetBlue flight was forced to make an emergency landing at Westchester County Airport, New York last night after two geese smacked into its windshield.

Pilots were forced to ground the craft - an Embraer 190 - after hitting the birds shortly after takeoff at 6.45pm.

The bird strike is the second to ground a New York flight in less than a week, after a Delta plane was forced to turn back to JFK Airport last Thursday.

A spokeswoman for JetBlue said the affected plane was flight 571 to West Palm Beach, which had 54 passengers and four crew members on board.

One of the pilots radioed controllers immediately after hitting the birds, saying, 'We got to come back. We hit two big geese. We are declaring an emergency.'

The plane travelled just six miles from the airport before turning back, and passengers found themselves back on the tarmac a mere seven minutes after leaving it.

Nobody was injured as a result of the incident, but the weighty birds were less lucky: Their remains could be seen on the jet's windshield, which was damaged in the impact.

The plane had travelled just six miles when it was forced to land. The passengers were all safely transferred to another flight

Passengers on the flight were safely transferred to another plane, which took off at 9pm, an official said.

The bird strike comes after a similar collision last Thursday, when a Delta flight undertook an emergency landing at JFK Airport after birds were sucked into one of its engines seconds after takeoff. 

Passengers on board the Boeing 757 told of their terror, and one captured his response on video.

In the footage, the visibly shaken passenger describes 
the moment birds hit the plane's engine, causing the whole plane to 
shake and fill the cabin with smoke. He calls the incident 'the scariest thing I have ever 
done 
in my life' and admits he thought it would be his 'last flight'.

Business expert Cardone, who hosts TV show Turnaround
King, describes hearing the birds 'grind through the engine' and the 
plane shaking so much that he thought it was going to crash.

Happily for the plane's passengers, the pilot of Delta Flight 1063 held his nerve and calmly reported the engine problem to ground controllers, who directed him back to the runway. 

The pilot landed the Boeing 757 safely at 
the New York airport, and there were no injuries reported. 

Collisions between planes and wildlife are reasonably common in the New York area, and the Federal Aviation Administration recorded 121,000 strikes, mostly birds, between 1990 and 2010. In recent years, there have been an 
average of 26 strikes a day.
