Three men suspected of murdering two British medical students in Malaysia appeared in court today.

Neil Dalton, 23, and Aidan Brunger, 22, who were stabbed to death on August 6 in Borneo during a night out before they returned to England.

Today fishmonger Zulkipli Abdullah, 24, mechanic Yeo Kia Sing, 29, and unemployed Remy Bin Marjuki, 19, appeared in court.

A fourth suspect, Abdul Aziz Bin Karim, is expected in court tomorrow as he was remanded by police a day later than the others.

The four men face the death penalty after 'admitting the crime'.

Two were said to have previous 
convictions for drugs and armed robbery and three had tested positive 
for Methamphetamine, a powerful stimulant also known as crystal meth, 
according to a police report.

Datuk Dr Chair Khin Chung said that one of the suspects in the group had served two months in prison for possessing drugs.

He
 said: 'He was in jail for two to three months in 2012. He was caught 
with a quantity of drugs in his possession. He served time for it.'

Tributes paid: Neil Dalton, 22, died after being stabbed to death in Borneo following reports of a row in a bar

Tributes: A candlelit vigil was held at the murder scene last week, after the Newcastle University students died

This week Neil Dalton’s parents paid tribute their son.

In
 a statement released through police, Janet, 54, and Philip Dalton, 56, 
from Belper, Derbyshire said: ‘We are just a normal family and we cannot
 believe what has happened.

‘Neil was a caring, thoughtful and witty young man, who never thought twice about helping others.

'He achieved so much and made so many friends in such a short time. We are so very proud of him.

‘Neil was a hard worker and very academic. He kept himself fit and was very sporty; involving himself in many football and cricket teams over the years. Neil enjoyed cycling and running and was always up for a challenge.’

Mr Dalton, who achieved four A* grades at A-Level and ‘always wanted to be a doctor’, was called ‘the brightest, the best, the most intelligent and self-motivated’ by one family friend.

And his brother Glen said today: ‘Neil was a best friend to many. This is evident from the number of his friends who have contacted me and referred to him as this and have passed on their happy memories that they shared with him.

'He will be sadly missed by so many.’

The attack happened in the Jalan Padungan area of Kuching in Sarawak province.

Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger, were said to have got into an argument with the men on the table next to them in the bar and after leaving on foot, they were followed by car and then attacked from behind.

Deputy police commissioner Chai Khin Chung said last week: ‘After a prolonged argument they left the bar on foot and were followed in a car. They came from behind and stabbed them.

Remembered: People pay tribute to the victims by laying flowers at the murder scene in Kuching, Malaysia

A cafe owner who tried to help the two described the scene of their killings as one he will ‘never forget’.

Avinash Ran said he saw one of the alleged killers calmly walk away after the incident.

He told the Daily Mirror: ‘He looked right into my eyes when he saw me and slowly walked around the side of the car and got inside the passenger seat.’

Last week the Mail reported how police said the thugs who murdered the students were high on drugs and will face hanging. The four suspects have confessed to killing the men, it was announced.

Under Malaysia’s laws, the penalty for murder is a mandatory death sentence. At a vigil, Malaysian government minister William Mawan said: ‘I am determined to see that justice will be done.’

Two have past convictions for drugs and armed robbery, and three tested positive for the drug methamphetamine, or crystal meth, police said.

Amnesty International says 441 convicts have been executed in Malaysia since 1960, and 696 were on death row as of February 2011. About a third were murderers.

Mr Dalton, of Belper, Derbyshire, and Mr Brunger, of Gillingham, Kent, were two days away from flying home, according to staff at their £4-a-night hostel, Singgahsana Lodge.

Mr Brunger was described as an excellent student who was planning to embark on medical research.
