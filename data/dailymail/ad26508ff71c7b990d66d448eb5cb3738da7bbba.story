Drenched in the glamour and elegance of Classic Hollywood, a $10 million Rose Bay property has hit the market, capturing the magical properties of light and space in the style of the Spanish Revival.

The stunning residence was designed by architect Alan Edgecliff Stafford in 1934, who worked closely with fellow architects in Los Angeles and Palm Beach in Florida during his career.

The magnificent property is anticipated to fetch close to $10 million at auction on November 10, and is evidently inspired by classic properties from the sun-bathed areas of LA.

Built in the Spanish Mission architectural style that Los Angles is so well known for, the house has been listed by the medical entrepreneur Robert Gregg and his wife, Elaine

Built in the Spanish Mission architectural style that Los Angeles is so well known for, the house has been listed by the medical entrepreneur Robert Gregg and his wife, Elaine. 

The Greggs bought the Tivoli Avenue residence in 1998 for $2.14 million from Anne Melkman, though the house was originally built for George Eckblade, managing director of Wrigley's Australia, and his wife, Helen.

The Spanish Mission style was influenced by traditional American Spanish homes, and enjoyed an architectural revival in America throughout the later 19th century, known as Mission Revival architecture.

Within Australia the movement was known as Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, or Inter-War Spanish Mission, and became popular in Victoria and NSW, especially between 1925 and 1939.

Bondi, Manly, Elizabeth Bay, Bellevue Hill, Biscaya and Rose Bay feature many Spanish Mission style houses built by Australian architects who were convinced that Mediterranean styles would suit the country's lifestyle. 

Sydney's semi-Mediterranean climate made it an epicentre for the lavish Spanish Mission homes, including this Tivoli Avenue residence.

The large 14-person dining room lends itself to both formal and casual dining, with a 1000-bottle bespoke wine cellar downstairs

The state of the art gas kitchen is perfect for catering for formal occasions or large family dinners

Stafford bridged the two styles, operating between Australia and the US, evident in the design of the property which meshes Hollywood glamour with iconic Harbour views.

Original touches of the Spanish Mission style include vaulted ceilings, arched windows, juliet balconies and a Spanish terra cotta tiled roof.

Much like the original style often featured white or yellow cream finish over brick walls, the Rose Bay residence stuns with white washed stucco walls and a light wine coloured exterior which offsets the expanse of native greenery on the property.

Completely restored in 1999 by John Normyle, who won the 2001 Heritage Award for the project, the Greggs later added the pool and self-contained guest cabana.

The home has also been the location for fashion shoots, used by internationally lauded Australian jewellery designer Samantha Wills for a Moroccan-inspired collaboration launch with ModelCo.

The main bedroom suite is both luxurious and expansive with matching dressing rooms for a couple. Two more bedrooms also have ensuites, on the same level as a lush sitting room with stunning views

All four bedrooms have ensuites, with a large marble bathroom, a powder room, and under floor heating for extra indulgence

The 1,126 square metre parcel of land is set privately in an elevated harbourside position, and features terraced gardens and multiple alfresco entertainment terraces and sundecks.
