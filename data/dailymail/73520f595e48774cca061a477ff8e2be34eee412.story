An insurance company has backed down from a fight with a Texas couple and announced it will cover their daughter's surgery.

Army veteran Tessa Snodgrass, 38, told FoxNews.com that Superior HealthPlan contacted her family on Thursday and said her daughter Savannah's Friday surgery is covered. Savannah, who is just seven months old, suffers from seizures and a brain tumor.

'We got a call from the neurosurgeon saying they got approval,' Snodgrass told the news channel. 'They had a cancellation today so it worked out.'

Though Savannah was being treated by Texas Children's Hospital, Superior HealthPlan said a Tuesday surgery would not be covered and that the hospital was 'out-of-network,' Fox News said.

Tessa Snodgrass also told the channel that Superior HealthPlan covered her daughter's medical expenses before that.

'I was shocked,' she earlier told Fox News. 'You don’t expect something like this to ever happen. I was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to Texas Children's all this time.' As part of her claims to the channel, Snodgrass said she was directed to a different hospital.

Superior HealthPlan cited 'continuity reasons' in a statement to Fox News saying why it would pay.

''Our number one priority has been to deliver the best health outcome for this child, as it is for all of our members, it said. 'Superior is happy to have identified a solution that ensures that this child receives continued care from the provider established prior to their enrollment with Superior. We will continue to assist this family in making sure they receive the care they need.

'While we have complete confidence that our in-network providers have the expertise and resources to give all of our members the individual care they need, we approach every member’s care individually. The importance of maintaining continuity of care combined with the complex and timely concerns of the family were critical to this decision.'

A request for comment to Superior HealthPlan from MailOnline was not immediately returned.
