Britain could be ready to join the Euro within just 10 years, Labour peer Lord Mandelson claimed today.

Anti-austerity protests are sweeping across Europe amid speculation of further bailouts for the troubled single currency.

But in a remarkable prediction branded ‘breathtaking’ by Tories, Lord Mandelson claimed the problems would be sorted out soon ‘in fits and starts’ and a new 'Eurozone Mark II' would emerge which the British people will want to join.

Lord Mandelson today said Britain's interests risk being ignored if it chose not to join a Eurozone Mark II

The former European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister said the battle to secure the future of the single currency will mean a 'more powerful political 
and institutional framework of policy and decision-making' emerging in Brussels.

He added: 'Now if that is successful - over the next five to ten years, not over the next five to ten months - I think it is possible, quite possible that Britain will want to review its relationship to the eurozone core.

'In those circumstances, I think we would have to revert to the British people again and ask them to take a view on what sort of relationship Britain has with Europe in the coming decades.'

David Cameron has faced growing calls for an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.

The Prime Minister is reported to be preparing to give a major speech soon on Europe soon as a direct response to the European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso’s recent call for a federal Europe.

In May Lord Mandelson said a referendum was needed as a ‘healthy means of re-establishing a consensus’ on Britain’s place in the world.

But today he made clear he still believes that Britain should move closer to the EU to stop its interests being ignored.

'What we don’t want to see is that as the
 eurozone integrates further, our interests are progressively ignored.

Tory MP Bernard Jenkin today said Lord Mandelson's enthusiasm for Britain to join the euro was 'breathtaking'

'We are deliberately putting ourselves in a position 
where we are choosing not to act constructively, not to engage with our 
European partners and inviting them to ignore what we believe are our 
interests and how we want to see the single market managed in the 
future.

'That’s the great danger of the direction in which the Government
 is presently going,' he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

However, the idea of Britain joining the Euro brought a furious response from senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin.

‘He wants Britain to be to be in the core in the euro and it is breathtaking that this man can [come] on your programme and not be questioned about the disaster which he advocated, he advocated this euro.’

Mr Jenkin added: ‘He very mellifluously tries to reassure you we can just lie back and let Europe develop.

‘I think the moment has probably passed where we can determine the direction of Europe, that passed us all 20 years ago.

‘But we can determine our relationship with Europe and the vast majority of the British people do not want to go anywhere near the core.’
