Baroness Thatcher’s death unleashed a wave of vitriol and hatred from the Left.

The first of several planned ‘Thatcher death parties’ across the country began last night with more than 200 revellers gathering in Brixton, south London.

They danced the conga, drank champagne and chanted: ‘Maggie, Maggie, Maggie – Dead, Dead, Dead.’

Happy: A woman drinks from a bottle and holds a front page of a newspaper displaying an image of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as she and others celebrate her death in Brixton, south London

Happy: In south London attendees were carrying banners, with one saying: 'Rejoice, Thatcher is dead'

Street party: People celebrate the death of Baroness Thatcher in Brixton, south London

Banners were held stating ‘Rejoice 
Thatcher is dead’ by drunken crowds, many of whom were too young to 
remember her as prime minister.

Similar disgraceful scenes were 
witnessed in Glasgow and further ‘parties’ were planned in Bristol, 
Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester.

Sickening messages also began flooding the internet minutes after the official announcement.

And at a National Union of Students 
conference in Sheffield some delegates cheered and applauded when 
informed of the former prime minister’s death.

Macabre celebrations: Champagne was flowing tonight as the Left took to the streets to celebrate the death of former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

Jolly affair: The hastily organsied party saw revellers holding signs reading 'Gotcha! Now get the rest'

Dancing to the beat: They did an impromptu Highland Fling on the pavements of Glasgow - although it was condemned by the city council

Getting underway: As the party got underway revellers handed out party balloons to help the celebrations

Cause: Revellers said they were 'here to celebrate the death of a woman with blood on her hands  for the Falklands and miners'

Eighties Trotskyist firebrand Derek 
Hatton, a sworn political enemy of Mrs Thatcher from his days as deputy 
leader of Liverpool City Council, sent one particularly vile message.

He tweeted: ‘The issue isn’t about 
whether she is now dead, I regret for the sake of millions of people 
that she was ever born.’

Former London Mayor and Labour MP Ken 
Livingstone claimed that ‘almost everything that’s wrong with Britain 
today is her legacy’.

He added: ‘She created today’s housing crisis, she produced the banking crisis, she created the benefits crisis.’

Chris Kitchen, general secretary of 
the National Union of Mineworkers, said: ‘We’ve been waiting for a long 
time to hear the news of Baroness Thatcher’s demise and I can’t say I’m 
sorry. I will not be shedding a tear for her.’

today her policies were 'fundamentally wrong'

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the 
GMB union, said: ‘Mrs Thatcher will be remembered by many for the 
destructive and divisive policies she reigned over which in the end, 
even in the Tory Party, proved to be her downfall.

Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams gave a scathing assessment of Baroness Thatcher’s political legacy in Northern Ireland.

Margaret Thatcher had been the IRA’s Number One target – narrowly escaping its devastating 1984 bomb at the Grand Hotel in Brighton.

Adams, whose voice together with those of fellow Sinn Fein representatives was subject to a broadcast ban during the Troubles, hit out at both her role in Ireland and beyond.

‘Margaret Thatcher did great hurt to the Irish and British people during her time as prime minister,’ he said.

‘Her legacy involves the destruction 
of communities, the elevation of personal greed over social values and 
legitimising the exploitation of the weak by the strong.’

Labour shadow pensions minister Gregg 
McClymont came under fire for ‘condoning’ an inflammatory tweet about 
the former Conservative prime minister.

He was accused of being ‘extremely 
foolish’ when he described a university student’s political views as 
‘spot-on’ following a reference to Lady Thatcher a ‘f***** witch’.

Peter Taaffe, the Socialist Party 
general secretary, said Lady Thatcher was ‘seen by many as a kind of 
modern-day Genghis Khan’.

Music star Morrissey, a long-time critic, berated her as ‘barbaric’ and ‘without an atom of humanity’.

Comedians were also quick to add to the insensitive tirade against the former PM.

Comedian Frankie Boyle, referring to 
IRA hunger strikers, tweeted: ‘Booby [sic] Sands ghost just appeared to 
me, trying to start a conga’, and added: ‘Thatcher being dead is a lot 
less tragic than Cameron being alive.’

Disrespectful: Comedian Frankie Boyle tweeted 
'Terrible news about Thatcher' and linked to the YouTube video 
'Celebrate good times come on!'

The Scottish parliament caused outrage by refusing to mark Baroness Thatcher’s death by flying its flags at half mast.

At Holyrood, the Saltire, the Union flag and the European Union flag all remained at full mast outside the public entrance, as did the Saltire in front of the government’s nearby St Andrew’s House headquarters.

Parliament bosses said flags will be flown at half-mast only on the day of Lady Thatcher’s funeral, in line with existing policies.

A Tory source said: ‘This is an insult by Holyrood and government bosses.’

Boyle later added: ‘Finally I get to 
wear my black suit and tap shoes together’ and ‘I’m not sure that 
Margaret Thatcher got many women into politics, in the same way that 
Myra Hindley didn’t get a lot of women into hiking’.

TV presenter and stand-up comedian 
Terry Christian tweeted: ‘State funeral would be an insult to the 
millions who suffered and the social chaos of gangs, homelessness and 
hopelessness she brought.’

Footballer Joey Barton tweeted: ‘If heaven exists that old witch won’t be there.’

Dozens of students tweeted their 
distaste after delegates at the National Union of Students’ conference 
cheered and applauded when Baroness Thatcher’s death was announced at 
Sheffield City Hall.

NUS President Liam Burns made a statement a few minutes later, urging the 1,000 delegates to show ‘sensitivity’.

Comedian and TV presenter Patrick Kielty tweeted: 'RIP Margaeret Thatcher - her final wish was to be cremated but we've no coal left'

Timely: Less than an hour after her death was made public, a book entitled Thatcher Tributes with a witch on the front was on sale

When former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell 
wrote a positive tribute to the ‘First Lady of girl power’ on Twitter 
she received so much abuse she felt the need to delete it. She later 
tweeted to her 203,000 followers: ‘I’m sorry if I offended u. X’

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch was one 
of several people who responded to the negative Twitter reaction, 
writing: ‘Pygmies of the left so predictably embarrassing yourselves, 
know this: not a one of your leaders will ever be globally mourned like 
her.’

Millionaire businessman Lord Sugar – 
who was one of the first to pay tribute – similarly took issue with 
those who objected to his comments.

He wrote: ‘Some of the despicable scum
 tweeting foul mouth comments on my Baroness Thatcher tweet, were still 
drinking milk from a teat in the 80’s.’

A website set up three years ago asking ‘Is Margaret Thatcher Dead yet?’ was updated yesterday – with the word ‘YES’.

It ran the slogan ‘Margaret Thatcher 
is dead. This lady’s not returning,’ and encouraged people to host 
parties, publishing a music playlist including Ding Dong! The Witch Is 
Dead from The Wizard Of Oz.

Within an hour of her death being 
announced, nearly 155,000 people had ‘liked’ the page on Facebook, 
12,500 people had tweeted about it and an internet campaign launched 
urging people to download the song and make it No.1 in the charts.

And an Oddbins store manager was suspended for encouraging customers to buy champagne after Baroness Thatcher’s death.

The Twitter account for the Crouch End
 branch in north London read: ‘If for any reason, anyone feels like 
celebrating anything we have Taittinger available at £10 less than usual
 at £29.  Just saying …’

High street wine merchant OddBins in Crouch End, London, landed in hot water after tweeting: 'If for any reason anyone feels like celebrating anything we have Tattinger available at £10 less than usual at 329. Just saying...'
