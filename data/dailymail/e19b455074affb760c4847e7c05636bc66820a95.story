Grand drama: Kirk Douglas pictured as Spartacus in scene from the eponymous 1960 film directed by Stanley Kubrick

For some, Easter is an opportunity for Christian reflection. For others it is simply a time to indulge in a chocolate egg or two.

But Barry Norman looks forward to the Bank Holiday weekend for a very different reason… the number of epic films traditionally broadcast on television.

The film critic has drawn up a list of the top ten epic movies, including modern hits such as The Lord Of The Rings alongside classics such as Ben-Hur and Gone With The Wind.

He told the Radio Times Easter has traditionally been ‘a time when TV networks dusted down their epic movies for our edification – Biblical epics of course – to remind us that Easter is about rather more than chocolate eggs and the Easter bunny’.

Big budget epics, portraying life on a grand scale, required huge sets and casts in Hollywood’s golden era but now these elements are more often than not replaced by computer generated images.

Mr Norman, 79, who presented BBC TV’s Film programme between 1972 and 1998, said he had no problem with the use of such effects to achieve a sense of awe and scale.

He said: ‘An argument is currently raging about whether a film can truly be regarded as an epic if it relies heavily on CGI, as all recent films claiming to be epics do.

‘The purists say no. The use of computers to create crowds and exciting effects, they seem to suggest, is cheating. I think the purists should get a life.’

Classic entertainment: Charlton Heston as the eponymous Ben Hur from the 1959 hit

Norman placed Ridley Scott¿s Gladiator, made in 2000, onto the list, lauding it for its 'stirring action, both in and out of the arena'

Mr Norman’s list, which is in no particular order, includes two modern works, Sir Peter Jackson’s The Lord Of The Rings trilogy – which he lists as a single film and praises as ‘daring and highly imaginative stuff on every level’ – and  Ridley Scott’s Gladiator, made  in 2000, which he lauds for its  ‘stirring action, both in and out of the arena’.

Gladiator was ranked alongside two other Roman epics, Ben-Hur, from 1959, and Spartacus, made the following year. He says of Ben-Hur: ‘I doubt whether even a computer could have produced a more exciting and realistic chariot race than the one in Ben-Hur.’

Of Spartacus, he says: ‘Still one of the best examples of the genre.’

Historical tale: Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole starring in the film Lawrence Of Arabia in 1962

Describing Lawrence Of Arabia, made in 1962 and starring Peter O’Toole, he says: ‘Practically every superlative you can think of has been applied to David Lean’s epic …and it deserves them all.’

Apocalypse Now, released in 1979, he calls self-indulgent but magnificent and Gone With The Wind, from 1939, he describes as: ‘The greatest unresolved love affair in cinema.’ 

Mr Norman said: ‘The main ingredient of an epic movie is size. It has to tell an extraordinary tale – whether Biblical, historical or totally fictional – on a grand scale.

‘And ideally at the heart of it,  never mind the momentous events going on, there should be an intimate story.’

Both Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur are among the epics being screened this Easter weekend.
