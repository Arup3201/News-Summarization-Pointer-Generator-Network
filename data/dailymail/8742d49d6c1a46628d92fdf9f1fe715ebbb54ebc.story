He may be better known for his cocktail dresses, but this fall designer Derek Lam has created a  limited-edition 2010 cabernet sauvignon.

Poetry by Derek Lam was made in collaboration with Cliff Lede Vineyard's in California's Napa Valley.

'To create a wine, which may seem [completely different from] creating fashion, actually has many parallels,' Mr Lam told Women's Wear Daily.

'The most exciting intersection is that [each] comes from a passion for imagination and creativity.'

Blended
 by the designer himself with fruit from Cliff Lede’s flagship Poetry 
Vineyard, the wine contains 76per cent cabernet sauvignon, 14per cent 
merlot, 6per cent petit verdot, 3per cent cabernet franc and 1per cent 
malbec.

With only 47 
cases produced, it will be sold for $210 per bottle.

Poetry by Derek Lam will be available October 2013 exclusively through Cliff Lede’s and Derek Lam’s 
top client lists, as well as Neiman Marcus.

Mr Lam is the latest in a long 
line of celebrities who have recently launched their own vintages.

Drew 
Barrymore created Barrymore Pinot Grigio, Fergie launched Fergunson 
Crest, and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are selling a Miravel rose from 
their French chateau.

Mr
 Lam, a native of San Francisco, began his fashion career in 1990 after 
graduating from Parsons School of Design.

He then spent twelve years at 
the highest levels of American fashion as a designer at Michael Kors 
before starting his own label.

His refined sportswear and art of layering staples such as textured leggings, dresses and trenchcoats have made him a hit in the fashion world.

He is also a favorite of celebrities including Leighton Meester, Kate Bosworth and Jessica Alba.

In 2006 the collection expanded to include handbags, followed by shoes and eyewear in 2007.

Last year the designer teamed up with Schwartz & Benjamin to expand his footwear offerings, and he also recently launched a diffusion line, 10 Crosby Derek Lam.

After finishing a resort collection that was inspired by coffee table books on Africa, Mr Lam is preparing for Spring 2014 Fashion Week.
