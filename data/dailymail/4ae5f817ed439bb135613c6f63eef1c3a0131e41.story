Lauren Winfield struck her maiden international half-century as England completed a 3-0 whitewash of South Africa in the women's NatWest T20 series with victory by eight runs at Edgbaston.

The touring side threatened to claim their first ever win against England in the format, having reached 77 for one in the 14th over while chasing a target of 127, but they instead lost four wickets in 16 balls to finish on 118 for six.

Winfield, 24, hit a powerful 74 from 60 balls in England's 126 for six after the early departure of captain Charlotte Edwards, whose unbeaten innings underpinned previous victories at Chelmsford and Northampton.

From that setback in the third over, Winfield took responsibility as she raced past her previous best of 36, driving powerfully and smearing balls confidently through the leg side, including a six over mid-wicket off Chloe Tryon's first ball to add to nine fours.

South Africa used seven bowlers in all and it was the wrist-spin of Dane van Niekerk, making her 38th international T20 appearance aged only 21, who brought order to proceedings during the middle stages.

A big-turning leg-break beat Natalie Sciver and Trisha Chetty reacted smartly to complete the stumping, the wicketkeeper displaying the same athleticism later on when Heather Knight attempted to force a ball from left-armer Tryon slanting across her.

South Africa had won the toss on a good pitch and the early wicket of Edwards to a leading edge after scores of 62 and 75 hitherto provided the start they wanted.

Winfield responded by hitting Marizanne Kapp for three fours in a row, only for the highly-rated Sarah Taylor to drive to long off.

England were slightly off line with the new ball and Van Niekerk and Chetty put on 59 for the first wicket before confusion resulted in the run-out of Van Niekerk as Winfield held her nerve with time to throw.

Nerves may have got to the South Africans after the loss of Lizelle Lee to the accurate medium pace of Jenny Gunn.

Lydia Greenway and Sciver combined to run out Chetty and a brilliant overhead catch by Greenway at deep mid-wicket accounted for Mignon du Preez next ball.

The quick hands of wicketkeeper Taylor ran out Kapp and stumped Bernadine Bezuidenhout as the required rate reached 10 per over before the experienced Gunn held her nerve to keep a full length with the last six balls.

Thirteen runs were required from the final over, but Gunn's medium pace only allowed four singles.

England captain Edwards said: 'South Africa bowled and fielded well, but our experience counted in the end.

'Jenny Gunn bowled a brilliant last over, and I am really pleased with the way Lauren Whitfield went out and played so well at the top of the order. The future looks bright for us and there is a big two years ahead.'

Whitfield, speaking about her first international half-century, added: 'I have had a few starts so it was nice this time to go on and make an impact.

'It was quite a slow pitch and the loss of Lottie and Sarah Taylor early meant I had to bat further into the game myself.

'There is a lot of competition for places at the moment, so I am glad I was able to take my chance today.'

Du Preez, the South Africa captain, said: 'We are heading in the right direction as a team, and the more experience we get playing against strong opposition the better we will get.'
