Authorities say a Pennsylvania man provided bad information to police about the suspect accused of killing a state trooper.

Michael Abuiso was charged Friday in Monroe County with making false reports and related counts.

According to a complaint, Abuiso lied to police by saying suspect Eric Frein asked him in August for a forged identity in order to enter Canada.

But the entire account was made up, Abuiso later admitted, and he had never even met Frein and may have been trying to buy leverage on previous charges he faced, according to authorities.

Frein has been on the run from authorities since a trooper was fatally ambushed Sept. 12 outside his Pocono Mountains barracks. Another officer was injured.

Authorities say Abuiso first lied to Barrett Township police, then repeated the claim to troopers Sept. 18 before acknowledging it wasn't true.

A message left for the 48-year-old Canadensis resident wasn't immediately returned. It's not clear if he has a lawyer. 

Police are still searching for him more than a month after he shot dead a trooper and seriously injured another.

The post office is near Pocono Mountain East High School, Frein's old school. A woman out for a walk on Friday night spotted a rifle-toting man with a mud-covered face at the school.

On Tuesday morning, police swarmed around a clothing bin, which is used to collect clothing donations, in Swiftwater before moving on.

The Pocono Mountain School District also decided to cancel classes for Tuesday - even though officials said on Monday they would remain open.

State Police Trooper Tom Kelly explained classes were called off 'as a result of the police activity in the area of the school'. 

Authorities had been searching for him in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis but shifted their primary search area five or six miles to the southwest after Friday night's sighting.

Lt. Col. George Bivens said over the weekend that police have put a 'tremendous amount of pressure on him' and likely forced him to move.
