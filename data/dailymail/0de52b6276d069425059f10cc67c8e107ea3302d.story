Citing beer cans and used condoms that constantly litter his lawn, a Northwestern University professor has quit his job because of the campus’s hard-partying culture.

Dr. Mark Waymack was an Adjunct Associate Professor in Medical Humanities and Bioethics at Northwestern at the school’s medical school, but not anymore. He’s moving on from the prestigious university and, along with his prophylactic covered yard, he blames the administration’s lenient attitude toward student antics.

He’ll also be relocating from his home of 18 years that sits very near the Evanston, Illinois campus.

Partied out: After living near the Evanston, Illinois campus of Northwestern University for 18 year, Dr. Mark Waymack has decided to quit his job at the school and blames its hard-partying, raucous students

‘My perception is there’s a culture of tolerance or perhaps indifference on the institution’s part that students will be students," Waymack wrote in a letter of resignation that was read at a local council meeting. ‘I hold you and your office accountable for this sort of behavior.’

That behavior, says Waymack, apparently includes hanky panky in his backyard.

‘The used condoms tend to show up in the back yard, actually,’ Waymack told CBS Chicago, and ‘the vomit, the beer cans in the hedges. I think they horse around late at night.’

And speaking of antics of a sexual nature, an archaic ‘brothel law’ began to be enforced once again in 2011 in an attempt to limit the number of occupants in student housing as a means of cutting down on off-campus partying.

And in October 2010, a party became so out of control—with unconcealed public urination, belligerent screaming about blow j**s, and liberally strewn vomit—that neighbors took their anger to the school’s dean.

The Dean of Students responded in kind with a letter sent to all off-campus students, which Gawker subsequently published.

‘Messages have been circulating between residents and City officials including the Mayor, Alderman, Chief of Police and University officials including President Schapiro,’ wrote the incensed dean. ‘Reports have flooded our offices about NU students being rude, urinating and vomiting on people's property often within the view of the property owner and their children. After the parties, piles of garbage, cups, bottles and kegs were strewn about yards and parkways- often in clear view from the street for more than 24 hours, and some properties have still not fully cleaned up. Put simply... this is unacceptable behavior and is not the way to begin a new year with your fellow Evanston residents.’

Too fun? Northwestern has long been known for its excellent academics but in recent years its gained a party school image as well, even instituting so-called 'brothel laws' to curb partying

The dean went on to ask, 'Didn't they learn ANYTHING from their parents or from the 12 years of school that preceded their relocation to Evanston?'

The school had little to say about Waymack's departure, however.

'The university tries to be a good neighbor and hopes our students are good neighbors as well,' said a spokesman. 'We wish him well in his future endeavors.'

Apparently, the dean's 2010 email didn’t resonate to future students. At least not strongly enough for Waymack's liking.

The professor plans to move on from Evanston and from his Northwestern job, but will retain his position as an associate professor of philosophy at Chicago’s Loyola University.
