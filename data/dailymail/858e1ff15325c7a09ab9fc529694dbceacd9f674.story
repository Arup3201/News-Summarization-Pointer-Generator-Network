Genting Casino, Salford, where the 86-year-old victim had won £1,000 before being mugged on way home

A pensioner who carried around her £6,000 in life savings because she was afraid of being burgled was mugged on the way home from a casino.

The 86-year-old woman's bag, containing about £7,000, was snatched at 2.35am shortly after she got out of a taxi on her way home from Genting Salford Casino, Greater Manchester Police said.

Along with her life savings, she was also robbed of her £1,000 winnings by the suspect, described as a young man, about 5ft 4ins and skinny.

The thief, who was wearing a black hooded jacket with the hood up, and black trousers snatched her white satchel bag from her shoulder in the Swinton area of Greater Manchester, before running off. 

The
woman is believed to have sustained bruising to the arm and shoulder 
and is recovering from shock following the incident on Sunday morning.

Pc
Michelle Ingham of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a 
particularly cruel robbery on a vulnerable, lone, elderly woman who had 
been enjoying a night out at the casino and was returning home with a 
large amount of cash in her handbag.

'She kept her life savings with her because she was afraid her home would be burgled while she was out, but sadly has fallen victim to just such a crime by a despicable and callous thief.

'As a result, she now faces not just a bleak Christmas but an uncertain future beyond that.

'We desperately want to get this woman her money back so we are appealing to anyone who has information to come forward.

'I would appeal to anyone who either witnessed what happened or suspects who may be involved to call us immediately.

'It might be this thief starts bragging about unexpectedly coming into money so please, if you do suspect who it might be, search your conscience and tell us what you know and help us stop this woman enduring a miserable Christmas.'
