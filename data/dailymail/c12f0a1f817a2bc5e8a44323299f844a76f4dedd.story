Indonesian divers on Sunday found the black box of the AirAsia plane which crashed in the Java Sea a fortnight ago with 162 people aboard, the transport ministry said.

But they failed to retrieve it because it was stuck under debris from the main body of the plane, it added.

'The navy divers in Jadayat state boat have succeeded in finding a very important instrument, the black box of AirAsia QZ8501,' said Tonny Budiono, a senior ministry official.

The news comes a day after the tail section of the AirAsia aircraft was pulled from the sea off the coast of central Borneo on Saturday.

Indonesian search teams now believe they have found the fuselage of the AirAsia airliner, and divers hope calmer waters on Monday will allow them to retrieve the black box flight recorders. 

Also on Sunday a photograph emerged of an AirAsia search team member who appears to be posing in front of the downed jet's tail, which was recovered from the bottom of the Java Sea on Saturday.

Indonesia AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lost contact with air traffic control in bad weather on December 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.

None of the 162 people on the aircraft survived. So far 48 bodies have been recovered from the site, including at least two still strapped into their seats. 

Searchers have been hearing pings, believed to be from the aircraft's two black boxes near where the tail of the Airbus A320-200 aircraft was raised. 

Marsma Supriyadi, operations coordinator for the National Search and Rescue Agency, said earlier on Sunday a sonar scan had revealed an object measuring 10 metres by four metres by 2.5 metres on the sea floor.

'They suspect it is the body of the plane. There is a big possibility that the black box is near the body of the plane,' Supriyadi said in the town of Pangkalan Bun, the base for the search effort on Borneo. 

'If it is the body of the plane then we will first evacuate the victims. Secondly we will search for the black box.' 

The tail was hoisted from the Java Sea on Saturday with inflatable bags from a depth of 30 metres

The find comes two weeks after the AirAsia flight crashed into the sea, with 162 people on board

'Three ships have (recorded) the pings so we can confirm the coordinates of the location of the black box,' Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee investigator Santoso Sayogo confirmed.

If weather conditions are conducive, 'hopefully they will recover the black box tomorrow (Monday) morning,' Santoso said. 'The coordinates show the bottom of the sea (in that location) is sand so the divers should easily be able to see it.' 

If and when the recorders are found and taken to the capital, Jakarta, for analysis, it could take up to two weeks to download data, investigators said, although the information could be accessed in as little as two days if the devices are not badly damaged. 

Bad weather has hampered the search efforts, making it difficult for divers to inspect the site

So far 48 bodies have been recovered from the site, including two that were still strapped into their seats

Separately on Sunday, a DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Indonesia's Trigana Air crashed on landing at Enarotali Airport in Paniai, Papua.

Strong winds caused the aircraft to roll over, domestic news website Detik.com reported, with no injuries to the three crew members on board. 

The plane was not carrying any passengers.
