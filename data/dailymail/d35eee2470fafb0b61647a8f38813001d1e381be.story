A former Cabinet minister tonight revealed urine has been pouring through the ceiling of his Commons office.

Labour MP Ben Bradshaw took to Twitter to complain that his office ‘stinks’ after sewage from a toilets above his office seeped through Parliament’s crumbling walls.

The former Culture Secretary revealed Victorian copper piping was to blame for the disgusting plumbing problem which has plagued his office for two days.

Ben Bradshaw posted this picture on Twitter, telling his 18,000 followers 'urine not visible but *stinks*'

The Exeter MP revealed on Twitter that he has been struck with the plumbing problem two days

Mr Bradshaw, who served in Gordon Brown's last Cabinet, revealed the smell was only made bearable by his staff wearing strong perfume.

The Houses of Parliament are in such a dreadful state of disrepair that MPs could be moved out for five years for massive renovations to be carried out.

Mr Bradshaw suffered the consequences first hand when waste from toilets above his office began seeping through.

Parliament is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world

‘Urine seems to be pouring through the ceiling into my Commons office for the second day running!’ he wrote on Twitter.

Quizzed by other users of the site, he said the problem was caused by ‘a men's urinal with Victorian copper piping with holes in it’. He later used the hashtag #urinegate.

When someone suggested by a can of air freshener, Mr Bradshaw replied: ‘Thankfully my 2 female student assistants wear very nice strong perfume.’

Another Twitter user asked if his office was ‘all grandeur and pomp’, but the Exeter MP posted a photograph, adding: ‘v grand as you can see urine not visible but *stinks*#urinegate’

An aide in the MPs office said Commons officials had leapt into action after he started posting the tweets.

A contractor will be sent to clean up the mess in the morning.

The Commons Commission has warned the repair bill for Parliament will top £1.6billion, saying it is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world.

A recent report by MPs revealed decades of alterations had created a complex patchwork of wiring and plumbing which was almost impossible to repair.

‘Even routine tasks, such as unblocking down pipes and sewage outlets, are problematic in this environment, where pipes disappear into inaccessible voids and are entangled with other uncharted services and asbestos,’ the House of Commons Commission said.
