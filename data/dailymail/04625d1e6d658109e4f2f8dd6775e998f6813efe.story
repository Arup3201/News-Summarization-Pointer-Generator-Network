A British Red Cross worker and his gay Haitian partner were attacked by dozens of locals who threw petrol bombs and rocks at the couple's private engagement party.

Several people were injured, two cars were set on fire and windows were smashed at the residence where the ceremony took place in Port-au-Prince on Saturday.

Police arrived just in time to prevent people being killed, inspector Patrick Rosarion told AFP.

More than 1,000 people took to the streets of Port-au-Prince last month to protest against a proposal to legalise gay marriage in Haiti

The attack on the British man, named as Max, and his Haitian partner, was a clear example of homophobia, a gay rights advocate has said.

'This is a criminal act and homophobic,' said Charlot Jeudy, an official from Kouraj, a group that defends the rights of homosexuals in Haiti.

'There is no justification for this kind of attack on people in a private residence. Hopefully the justice authorities will react to the perpetrators of this act.'

The British victim said he was fine but did not wish to discuss the matter for fear of identifying his partner and making him more vulnerable to acts of homophobic violence.

Protestant church members in Haiti have conducted street protests in Port-au-Prince, chanting 'no to gay marriage in Haiti.'

Gay rights organisations have expressed shock at the treatment they have received.

More than 1,000 people took to the streets of Port-au-Prince last month to protest against a proposal to legalise gay marriage in Haiti.

There is a strong social stigma in the country which sparks fears of violence and loss of employment.

In June, a group of men threw rocks and broke down the door of a house where a group of homosexual friends were meeting, according to the Kouraj rights group.

Two men were reportedly injured after being attacked with broken bottles and stones.
