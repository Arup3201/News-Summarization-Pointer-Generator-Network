Mark Chanko, 83, a Korean War veteran and father-of-five, was killed by a truck in 2011. His death was featured on ABC show NY Meds without his family's permission

A widow whose husband died after being hit by a truck has revealed the horrifying moment she watched his last breaths broadcast on a reality TV show.

In August 2012, Anita Chanko was watching an episode of ABC's NY Med, which features Dr Mehmet Oz, when she saw her late husband Mark undergoing treatment in attempts to save his life.

Korean War veteran Mr Chanko, 83, had passed away 16 months earlier at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in April 2011 after being hit by a sanitation truck on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. 

Mrs Chanko was able to hear her husband of 46 years' last words just moments before he passed away - an intimate moment broadcast for millions of viewers that she had not given permission for. 

In an article, published on Friday, she told propublica.org: '[E]ven with the blurred picture, you could tell it was him.

'You could hear his speech pattern. I hear my husband say, ''Does my wife know I'm here?'''

As doctors discussed her husband's fatal injuries and got ready to pronounce him dead on camera, Mrs Chanko said she 'clenched her fists so tightly that the palms of my hands almost looked like stigmata', according to propublica.

Mrs Chanko and her children filed a $5million lawsuit against ABC, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and attending surgeon, Dr Sebastian Schubl.

The family said that the father-of-five's death was broadcast on TV for 'the entertainment of strangers' without the family's consent. 

The hospital and ABC said that the patient could not be identified because his face was blurred in the footage.

However, Mrs Chanko told propublica that Mr Chanko's loved ones immediately knew it was him. 

Even a woman who once worked as a pet-sitter for the couple called Mrs Chanko to say that she recognized it was her late husband in the TV clip.

The New York State Health Department found that New York-Presbyterian did violate the dying 83-year-old's rights and their own privacy policy. 

American College of Emergency Physicians spokesman, Dr Charles Pattavina, told MailOnline on Friday that although there are benefits to medical TV reality shows in keeping the public informed about healthcare, doctors must take care not to go too far.

Dr Pattavina, chief of emergency medicine at St Joseph's Hospital in Maine, said: 'I think it's great when these shows seek to be informative to people about health issues and what to expect from a healthcare environment.

'But it is problematic when some shows become too driven by ratings.

'As doctors, were must be mindful not only of laws and regulations but of being sensitive to families. 

'In general, if a physician sees something which is not proper or adequately sensitive, then they should say something. We should not abdicate our responsibility as leader of a healthcare team.'

Dr Pattavina said that although it was rare to see people dying on TV shows, he added: 'I'm not sure it would be very helpful to the public or reassuring.'

'Lines shouldn't be crossed when it comes to privacy... and we have a responsibility to families' responses and emotions,' the doctor said.

However the defendants  argued against the family's lawsuit that, legally, doctors are only barred from sharing private details only after the patient has been treated.

Because NY Med had a film crew on hand, during doctors' battledto save the dying Mr Chanko, it was within the law, according to lawyers for the hospital and TV network.

In November, an appellate panel dismissed the Chankos' case, according to Propublica, but the family asked for the decision to be reviewed and are working on an appeal.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from ABC on Friday.

New York Presbyterian Hospital refused to comment on pending litigation.

In an interview with MailOnline in March 2013, the family’s attorney, Mark Fox, said that in the operating room a studio with cameras and lights were set up, and the ABC staffers were dressed in scrubs to ‘keep the atmosphere'.

Mr Fox said that having to relive her husband's death on TV left Mrs Chanko 'completely distraught,' especially since she did not know that Mr Chanko was awake when he was brought to the ER.

‘The widow was sitting there watching TV and sees this terrible thing,’ Mr Fox said. ‘They [relatives] were all horrified.’

The lawyer told the New York Daily News in 2013 that at one point during Mr Chanko's treatment the doctors working on him discussed amputating his legs and trying to stop extensive bleeding in his abdomen.

After the 83-year-old had a heart attack, one of the physicians addressed his colleagues, asking: 'We all agree he's gone?'

Later in the show, a social worker and Dr  Schubl, the chief orthopedic resident, break the news of Mr Chanko's death to his family in the waiting room.

Mr Fox said the doctor had a microphone on, but the grieving relatives’ words were left out of the show. A camera was trained on the door of the room that the family were in.

‘They never suspected that the saddest moment of their live was being recorded,’ Mr Fox added.

ABC removed the episode in question last year after the Chankos complained.

The attorney explained that when his client approached the hospital and ABC, they were told that the producers of the show did not think it was necessary to ask for consent in this case because the patient’s face was obscured.

‘They thought if they put a little smudge on it was enough,’ Mr Fox said, adding that Mr Chanko's voice was instantly-recognized to his family.

The attorney said that all the other patients featured in the series were given release forms to sign, but Mrs Chanko was never asked for her permission. He pointed out that she would not have given it. 

According to his New York Times obituary, Mr Chanko, a grandfather-of-eight, served in the Korean War and later became a certified public accountant. He was described as an avid tennis and bridge player, and a lover of the arts.

NY Med premiered on ABC on July 10, 2012. The eight-part medical documentary series followed the medical staff and patients of Columbia University Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medical Center, both a part of New York–Presbyterian Hospital, as well as Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn.

The show enjoyed high ratings throughout its run and received critical acclaim.
