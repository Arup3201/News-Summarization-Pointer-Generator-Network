A school has banned triangular flapjacks on health and safety grounds after a pupil was hit in the eye by one during a lunch-time food fight.

Dinner ladies at the comprehensive school were told to cut flapjacks into squares or rectangles only from now on after the Year 7 boy was sent home complaining of a sore eye.

This morning a spokesman for Essex County Council confirmed the ban on triangular treats at Castle View School on Canvey Island was true.

Danger: Castle View School in Essex has deemed the pointy corners of triangular flapjacks a health hazard

The new ruling on flapjacks, which have been served at the school for 15 years, was imposed by head Gill Thomas soon after the incident in the canteen last Wednesday.

The boy complained to staff that his eye hurt after he was struck in the eye by the corner of a flying flapjack, and was sent home for the afternoon, although his injuries did not merit hospital treatment.

The incident was reported to the head, and within 24 hours, school manager Keith Evans held a meeting for catering staff at the school, deemed 'satisfactory' by Ofsted, and told them to serve only four-sided flapjacks in future.

A source said: 'Catering staff were told the pointy, triangular flapjacks were dangerous after the boy hurt his eye.

'This doesn't address the fact that the children can cut them into pointy shapes if they wish, or the issue of behaviour in the canteen.'

This morning a spokesman for Essex County Council said: 'We can confirm that the story is true', but the school did not return calls from MailOnline.

Parents are now wondering what other potentially-lethal foodstuffs may be banned from the 1,200-pupil school on account of their shape.Â 

One said: 'I wonder if carrot batons will be prohibited from now on?'

Another said: 'This is bad news for broccoli spears.'
