Round my way a cadger was someone who liked to beg or borrow something from you.

But French giant Renault is hoping its 'Kadjar', a new crossover vehicle, pictured, will steal customers away from mighty Nissan's top-selling Qashqai.

With its rugged, chunky styling and aerodynamic lines, it's the bigger sibling of the existing Captur.

It'll go on sale in the summer on the continent, but British buyers will have to wait til autumn for a right-hand drive model to land. Expect prices from around £18,000.

Models for the European market will be built in Spain, but the Kadjar will also be the first Renault to be built in China.

It'll be available in either four or two-wheel drive and Renault bosses say it's aimed at those with an adventurous spirit who still need manoeuvrability in town.

It features an ultra-modern, soft touch dashboard with a seven-inch colour touchscreen display. The road ahead is illuminated by full-LED twin headlights with an intense and precise beam.

There will be two different boot configurations make it possible to choose between a 'high' position with a completely flat floor to allow large items to be loaded, or a 'low' position to boost maximum carrying capacity.

Handles inside the boot automatically unlock and fold the 60/40-split rear seats without having to bother the driver.

Motorists are to have a motorway service station 'tsar' to drive up poor greasy spoon standards on Britain's motorways.

Roads minister John Hayes said he is to launch an inquiry into service standards and prices.

He will soon be appointing a chairman or 'tsar' to head it.

He wants to see fewer mass market chains and more independently run shops, bistros and outlets, as well as more green spaces in which to relax.

It follows moves by the Chancellor to force motorway filling stations to advertise their pump prices by the side of the road so drivers can decide whether to fill up or drive on. Mr Hayes said: 'Service stations were once rather glamorous. Crowds flocked to the opening of the first service station at Watford Gap in November 1959, and to Newport Pagnell which opened the following year.

'But like the motorway system they served, the glamour faded quickly. They became more notable for bad food, congestion and fighting football fans than for providing a pleasant, friendly environment for motorists and passengers to take a break. My vision for service stations is not just to offer a place where electric cars can be recharged, but also where drivers can be recharged, too.'

Suzuki has suspended UK sales of its just launched Celerio hatchback following a problem with the brakes.

The 1-litre supermini's 100-odd new owners have been advised not to drive their cars.

The brake glitch emerged during test runs on two cars carried out by What Car? and Autocar motoring magazines at the Millbrook Proving Ground in Bedford.

All stopping power was immediately lost when the brakes were applied at high speed.

Suzuki said the recall 'relates to retraction of the brake pedal and affects right-hand-drive vehicles for UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand'.

In a statement, it said: 'Suzuki is carrying out an immediate investigation into the cause of this condition.'

Ferrari has unveiled its latest 200mph super car with a roaring £200,000 price tag to match. And it's not just the stunning lines of the new 488 GTB, pictured, that will have you gasping. It'll accelerate to 60mph in less than three seconds and hit 120mph in a mere eight.

The two-seater supercar will be at next month's Geneva show and production starts in September. First deliveries from the Maranello factory in Italy will be well in time for Christmas, though British customers seeking a right-hand-drive model will have to wait until 2016.

It is powered by a 3902cc V8 engine — show cased behind glass at the rear — developing a massive 670 bhp. Top speed is 206mph. Such awesome power and performance takes its toll at the pumps, with average fuel consumption of just 24.8mpg and hefty CO2 emissions at 260g/km.

Its launch comes 40 years on from the unveiling of Ferrari's first mid/rear-engined V8 berlinetta, the 308 GTB. It replaces the outgoing 458 Italia, which cost £178,551 on the road.

BIG BEASTS TO LOCK HORNS IN HATCH WARS 

Hot-hatch wars are about to break out as we approach next month's Geneva Motor Show, with arch-rivals Ford and Vauxhall among those gearing up for a high-revving battle royale.

Vauxhall's 202 bhp Corsa VXR (pictured) reaches 0-62mph in less than 6.8 seconds, with top speeds of 143mph

Ford has weighed in with its new Focus RS which is set to cost less than £30,000 when it goes on sale next year, powered by a 2.3 litre EcoBoost engine delivering 318bhp and with all-wheel drive.

Meanwhile, Vauxhall is hitting the road with a 202 bhp Corsa VXR, pictured, which is capable of 0-62mph in less than 6.8 seconds and a top speed of 143mph for under £20,000.

James Bond can forget Beverly Hills and oil-rich Dubai — the world's biggest-selling Aston Martin dealership is in Britain.

Stratstone's showroom in Mayfair, London, tops the list, but is just one of three UK Aston Martin dealerships in the world's top five.

The others are Stratstone in Wilmslow, near Manchester (third), and Walton-on-Thames Aston Martin, in Surrey (fifth). All three are part of the Pendragon group.

Dealerships in Beverly Hills and Dubai took second and fourth place respectively.
