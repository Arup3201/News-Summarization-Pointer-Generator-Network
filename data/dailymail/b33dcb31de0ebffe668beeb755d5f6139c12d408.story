Despite fending off bombs and bullets in the harsh environment of a Middle Eastern war zone, soldiers are complaining about one simple thing – sore feet.

The US army are working to reinvent the humble army boot after soldiers complained about their footwear in a survey on conditions during operations.

Engineers are now in the final stages of a two-year project to develop boots so troops can comfortably negotiate arid terrains such as in Afghanistan.

Problems with boots, problems with everything: Soldiers have complained about sore feet caused by their boots during deployment in harsh environments such as Afghanistan and so the US army is working to develop a new, more comfortable boot

The US army must now choose between three American agencies which have come up with different versions of the improved military footwear after calling for submissions back in 2011.

Bob Hall, a footwear project engineer
at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center in 
Massachusetts, said troops live and sleep in their boots.

According to The Boston Globe he said: ‘If he’s having problems with his boots, he’s having problems with everything.’

Ben Cooper, also from the research centre, said: ‘Due to Afghanistan's unique climate and environment, they [troops] needed a boot that not only would provide them ankle stability and traction and durability, but they also needed greater breathability.

‘It's a balancing act. We were 
constantly walking that fine line. I think that we have worked with 
industry tirelessly on trying to make sure that we accomplish exactly 
what the warfighter wants and needs.’

Hold up in harsh conditions: The standard army combat boots don't work as well in mountainous terrain, engineer Bob Hall said

The
new boots are set to be about 0.5lbs lighter than boots currently worn 
by troops in Afghanistan and will be able to withstand hot summer 
temperatures upward of 37 degrees Celsius.

The three designs use different materials including leather, canvas, nylon and rubber to provide grip, protection and ventilation. 

Mr Hall said: ‘Because of the mountainous terrain, the standard combat boots don’t hold up as well.’

The different boots have been tested twice with over 200 soldiers donning the experimental footwear at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California under conditions similar to Afghanistan.

Researchers will either pick one of the designs or choose specific characteristics from each boot to create a new and improved version.

Each designer is using the same sole made by American shoe company Vibram USA. The unique sole has multidirectional lugs or spikes to give the shoes more grip while dislodging mud and debris as the soldier flexes the foot.

One specialist design agency, Danner in Portland, Oregon, used nylon, canvas and leather in its design, while the other two, Bates Footwear of Rockford, Michigan, and Belleville Boot Co in Belleville Boots, Illinois, used more nylon for support. 

The Belleville design uses leather and high-density nylon which has better ventilation than leather as well as being more light weight and thinner, allowing for flexibility.

In the Bates Footwear design, holes were added for more ventilation while the Danner boot covers ventilation holes with mesh to stop dirt getting into the boot.

Bates Footwear said its shoe contracts with the US army were worth £9.67 million in 2012. Boots sell retail for £96 to £174.
