Ethnic Russians flooded the streets of Crimea tonight as they celebrated the area's referendum to join with neighbouring Russia with fireworks and street parties.

Thousands revelled in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea, where the population is around 58 per cent ethnic Russia, and Sevastopol.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian soldiers at the only military base in Crimea not to surrender to Russia looked distraught as they received the news of the Moscow bill - regarded as illegal by the international community.

now wait for orders from Kiev as they prepare to repel the attacks of 
Crimea's pro-Russian self-defence units.

The
 celebrations in Simferopol and Sevastopol came just hours after 
President Vladimir Putin signed laws completing Russia's annexation of 
Crimea.

'Many people wanted this, to go back, not to the USSR, but to that big country of ours,'said Anna Zevetseva, 32.

'We are waiting for things to improve and for investment from Russia.'

Ukrainian and Tatar residents stayed behind closed doors.

Sergey,
 a 64-year-old Ukrainian businessman who did not want to give his 
surname, said he saw no reason to celebrate: 'An occupying force is in 
my country and we have been annexed.'

Last night David Cameron warned that Russia could make another land grab if the West does not stand up to Vladimir Putin over Crimea.

The Prime Minister said that unless the international community acts with resolve over Ukraine, there could be ‘similar situations in similar countries’.

He spoke amid concerns  that the Kremlin may follow up  its annexation of Crimea by absorbing a pro-Russian area of Moldova, known as Transnistria.

Tough talking: David Cameron holds a press conference at the end of the two-day European Council summit where he warned of further consequences for Russia if it continued to escalate the crisis in Ukraine

Ready for action: Mr Cameron's comments came as Ukrainian troops stepped up patrols on the Russian border in an attempt to pre-empt any further land grabs by the Kremlin in the country's east and south

Exercises: Soldiers were seen near Ukraine's eastern border strengthening defensive positions and drilling tactics in the event of an invasion in the region, which is home to many ethnic Russians

However, Mr Cameron’s call for tough action was undermined by a lacklustre response to the crisis by the EU.

Meeting
 in Brussels, the 28 European leaders imposed travel bans and asset 
freezes on 12 more Russians, bringing the total to 33.

They also 
signalled support for Ukraine yesterday by signing an agreement on 
closer economic ties designed to shore up the country’s failing economy.

Meanwhile, President Putin signed the annexation of Crimea into law.

Mr
 Cameron also refused to rule out targeting London oligarchs such as 
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in the future – although aides said it 
was unlikely.

And he called 
on the football authorities to look into whether the awarding of the 
2018 World Cup to Russia was above board. Russia beat England to the 
title.

The weak response 
from the EU was in stark contrast to that of the US, which targeted 
members of Mr Putin’s inner circle and imposed trade sanctions.

It
 also emerged that the US is preparing military exercises in Poland 
which could also involve forces from the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states.

Moldova is a former 
Soviet state nestled between Romania and Ukraine. A small strip of land 
on its eastern border is known as Transnistria and is home to a 
pro-Russian majority which declared independence from Moldova as the 
USSR disintegrated.

European
 diplomats are concerned that Moscow wants to reunite pro-Russian areas 
in southern and eastern Ukraine with the mother country in a land 
corridor reaching all the way to Transnistria.

Asked
 whether he is concerned Moldova could be next on Mr Putin’s target 
list, Mr Cameron said: ‘Obviously there were discussions about other 
regions and areas.

‘I think 
the general lesson people were drawing is that if this can happen in 
Ukraine then we have to be clear about how unacceptable it is – 
otherwise we will face similar situations in similar countries with 
similar unacceptable behaviour.’

Last
 night it emerged that London Mayor Boris Johnson is set to pull out of a
 trade trip to Russia in October following the annexation of Crimea and 
while sanctions remain in place against senior Russian politicians.
