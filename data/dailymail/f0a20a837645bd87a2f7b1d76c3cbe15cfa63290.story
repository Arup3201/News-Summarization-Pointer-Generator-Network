Cell phone records for the mom accused of poisoning her son with salt reveal she used her smart device to search for information on ways to commit suicide in the days following the boy's death.

Lacey Spears, 27, whose trail begins in Westchester, New York, on Monday is charged with depraved murder and manslaughter in the death of her five-year-old son Garnett-Paul Spears a year ago.

Spears' cellphone activity in the days leading up and immediately after January 23, 2014 - when Garnett Spears was declared brain dead - will be included as evidence in her trail.

As she faced charges of murder and manslaughter over her son's death, Spears' used her phone to research people who've killed themselves by overdosing on sleeping pills and self-injecting insulin.

Records show Spears searched 'overdose on sleeping pills' on Google and also searched for stories about suicide and queried whether overdosing on pills would be effective. 

A day earlier, she had conducted numerous online searches on insulin, including 'insulin poisoning with suicidal intent,' and the story of 'Kenneth Barlow: the first documented case of murder by insulin.'

In the lead up to her son's death, Spears had been highly active on social media as she chronicled Garnett's health issues and posted photos of his declining health.

In rulings delivered last week, Spears' messages on Facebook, Twitter and MySpace were determined relevant and are likely to be introduced as evidence.

The boy's sodium levels rose to a dangerous point with no medical explanation, prosecutors said, leading to a swollen brain, seizures and death.

They believe his single mother, who was sharing his hospital room at Westchester Medical Center, administered salt through a feeding tube into Garnett's stomach.

All the while, she was keeping followers up to date with 28 online postings in the last 11 days of his life, noting his death with, 'Garnett the great journeyed onward today at 10:20 a.m.' She had tens of thousands of entries over Garnett's lifetime, many about his doctor and hospital visits.

'My Sweet Angel Is In The Hospital For The 23rd Time,' Spears tweeted on Nov. 9, 2009, adding a sad-faced emoticon. 'Please Pray He Gets To Come Home Soon. 

The records show Spears also researched 'dangers of high sodium' and hypernatremia (high levels of sodium in the blood) several days before Garnett was admitted to hospital with seizures on January 17. 

Spears also searched for iodized salt the morning of January 19, after learning that Garnett was to be released from hospital because he was no longer having seizures.

She then repeatedly took him to the bathroom and he returned visibly ill each time, the papers say. 

His sodium level spiked to such a degree that he was airlifted to Westchester Medical Center, where he later died. 

Jury selection began last Monday with a pool of 90 potential jurors on hand at the courthouse. Several told the judge they had seen some of the extensive news coverage of the case.

Spears' trial is to begin at 9:30 a.m. Monday. Prosecutors said that after opening statements, they will have several witnesses ready to testify, including Spears' family friend Oona Younger.

Younger, who had visited Spears' home, had seen the boy attached to a feeding tube bag before accompanying the two to Nyack Hospital in the days leading up to Garnett's death, prosecutors said in court records. That bag was later seized by police and tested positive for high levels of sodium.

The trial before Westchester County Judge Robert Neary is expected to last three weeks.
