After returning to training after suffering a broken vertebra at the World Cup, Neymar could've been forgiven for taking it easy on his return to action with Barcelona. 

But the Brazilian forward, who only recently began taking part in full training, lit up the Nou Camp as Luis Enrique's side comfortably beat Mexican club Leon 6-0 in a friendly.

Neymar scored twice in his first game back after recovering from the serious injury he suffered at the hands - or should that be knee? - of Juan Camilo Zuniga in Brazil's quarter-final victory over Colombia in Fortaleza.

And after shining during four appearances on home soil over the summer, the 22-year-old picked up where he left of as the Catalan giants turned on the style on Monday evening.

His first major contribution was to provide the assist for fans' favourite Lionel Messi to open the scoring after just three minutes.

And nine minutes later he was on the scoresheet himself. The former Santos star latched onto a pass before running through on goal and chipping the ball over visiting goalkeeper William Yarbrough.

Neymar grabbed his second goal of the night just a minute before half time after combining with Messi once again.

The Argentine lifted a clever ball over the top of the Leon defence which Neymar attempted to take round Yarbrough with his first touch, only for the keeper to palm it out to his left.

The Brazilian ran on and picked up the loose ball though, cleverly backheeling it into an empty net with his first touch.

Although he was replaced by Munir El Haddadi - who scored twice in the second period - at half-time, Neymar did more than enough to suggest that his back injury will have no lasting effects.
