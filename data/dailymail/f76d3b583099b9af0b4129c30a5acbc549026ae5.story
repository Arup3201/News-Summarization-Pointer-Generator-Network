A young Pennsylvania woman has reconnected with her birth mother 23 years after she was given up for adoption - and she found her through Facebook in just 15 minutes.

Sunday was the first Mother's Day when Colette Brasseur didn't have to worry about the baby girl she'd given away in 1991, aged 24. And it was the first time Natalie Bader could thank the woman who brought her into the world.

Bader had a happy childhood with her adoptive parents Rosie and Don Bader but she always wanted to find her biological mother when the time felt right.

In December, she typed Brasseur's name 
into Facebook and within a quarter of an hour she'd located the 
47-year-old, who had relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, and her son 
Payton, 21.

She sent them both friend requests.

'Ironically, my first thought was that she looks familiar - I must know her parents,' Brasseur recalled to Today.com.

She didn't accept the friend request, however Payton, who didn't know he had an older sister at the time, did.

He told his mom that Bader claimed they were siblings, which is when Brasseur finally revealed the two decade-old secret she'd kept from him.

In 1991, Brasseur enlisted in the Army but soon discovered she was pregnant.

However, she had signed up because she was financially struggling so she knew she couldn't afford to raise her child.

An open adoption seemed like the best option.

She recalls having an immediate connection with the Baders.

'To this day I can remember thinking that she was as sweet as pie and he reminded me of Santa Claus - he was just real jolly and always laughing,' Brasseur told Today.com.

'And I thought there was something special about these two people. And thank God I was right.'

She kept in touch with the family for four years however, the relationship dropped off after the adoption agency closed, leaving Brasseur wondering if she'd ever see her daughter again.

The mother and daughter now speak everyday and Brasseur praises Facebook for helping her catch up on all the years she missed out on.

'Graduation and birthdays and holidays, because of the timeline, I was there,' she said.

'All the pictures that I didn't get from the [adoption] agency that I was promised, I got from Facebook.

The two still haven't met in person, due to the distance and cost of a flight.

But, despite that, this year's Mother's Day still holds a special significance because it's their first together.

'What Mother's Day means is that it'll be my first Mother's Day that I don't have to worry,' Brassuer said.

'When you give up a child or adoption, her life with [her adoptive parents] starts. But her life with me never stopped. Every time I saw a child around her age, I thought it could be her.'

'For years it was question after question after question, and I couldn't get answers,' she added. 'And now I've got 23 years worth.'
