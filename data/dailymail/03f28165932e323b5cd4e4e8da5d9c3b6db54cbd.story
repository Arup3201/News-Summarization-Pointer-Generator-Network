As thousands of veterans remember the sacrifice of their fallen comrades who gave their lives during the opening days of Operation Overlord, life at many of the locations that saw the heaviest fighting continues as normal.

In a fitting tribute to the fight against Nazi tyranny, young children are enjoying the freedom secured by those brave men and women on those dark days 70 years ago as the allies struggled for a foot-hold on mainland Europe.

By the end of the first day, in the region of 160,00 allied troops had made it ashore along a 50 mile stretch of the Normandy coastline at a cost of 4,000 lives.

The barbed wire has long since been removed from the Dorset holiday town of Weymouth, which one of the launchpads for the invasion of Europe

In the middle of the chaos of Omaha beach, US troops struggle ashore after their landing craft is sunk by murderous German fire from the cliffs above

Today, tourists enjoy the sunshine on the beach near Colleville sur Mer although a bucket and spade has replaced the M1 Garand rifle as the tool of choice

Omaha Beach, which was protected by overhanging cliffs had some of the most intense fighting of D-Day. Yesterday President Barack Obama visited the area as a 'powerful manifestation of America's commitment to human freedom'. 

President Obama said that 'by daybreak, blood soaked the water' and 'thousands of rounds bit into flesh and sand'.

He also spent time at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial where almost 10,000 white marble tombstones overlook the battle site.

After the success of the initial assault, US troops flooded Omaha to reinforce the beach head and break out into the French countryside before a counter attack

Today the only threat of counter-attack comes during a game of beach football on the sands where the second front in Europe against Adolf Hitler was opened

At the time of D-Day, supreme commander of the Allied invasion forces was smoking four packets of camel cigarettes a day. During the preparations for the invasion, cartographers printed 17 million maps.

The invasion was a logistical nightmare, with industry spending months preparing seven million jerry cans to carry fuel as troops advanced from the beach head. 

Special tanks were deployed on D-Day to destroy some of the four million mines which had been deployed to kill and maim soldiers and disable armour.

Over the past 70 years the concrete wall has crumbled allowing easier access for families going home after an enjoyable day in the surf

US paratroops who dropped into Normandy carried almost 55 kg of equipment, including two morphine syringes, 'one for pain, two for eternity'. They also carried 24 sheets of toilet paper in their emergency ration packs, as well as four chocolate bars and some tobacco.

In the aftermath of D-Day a lone soldier stands guard beside the remains of US fighter aircraft which has crash landed on Juno Beach during the assault

On Juno Beach, British and Canadian reinforcements are faced with wading past the bodies of hundreds of dead soldiers, killed during the opening attacks.

Soldiers are warned they must clear the beach without stopping, leaving behind injured comrades because of the intense fire from the defending Germans.

The concrete bunker remains as a reminder of the occupation while visitors to the beach today arrive in family saloons rather than amphibious tanks and landing craft

By the end of D-Day, the allies had landed 156,000 troops in Normandy suffering 10,000 casualties. Of the casualties, an estimated 4,000 lost their lives.

Within five days, almost 330,000 troops had crossed the English Channel supported by 54,186 vehicles carrying 104,428 tonnes of supplies.

US Army troops use a heavily fortified German bunker that they have just captured, overlooking Omaha beach as signal post

To assist the invasion, French railway workers sabotaged 37 lines leading to the area to prevent the Germans from moving large numbers of troops into Normandy.

Among the best trained troops on D-Day were two British commando brigades who were used on Sword, Juno and Gold beaches. Many of them had been subjected to live fire training exercises and harsh conditions in the Scottish highlands.

As the allies made their way inland they were met by thousands of German troops willing to surrender, many held in temporary camps such as the one in Nonant-le-Pen

Today there is little sign of the Nonant-le-Pin internment camp which has been returned to farmland

Former German soldier Paul Golz was captured by American troops three days after D-Day. He was manning a machine gun near Sainte-Mere-Eglise when an American tank appeared when he surrendered.  

He was moved to a British ship where he ate for the first time in several days.

'I told myself, man I want another meal - and I queued for a third time and ate for the third time,' he remembered. 'Then a British officer shouted - "what the hell is going on here? We only have 800 POWs on board but 3,000 eat?"'

Farmyard animals didn't escape the carnage after these four cows in Les Dunes De Varreville were killed by an artillery burst which showered them in shrapnel

Farmer Raymond Bertot was 19 when US troops took a rest in his farmyard which is only a short distance from Utah beach

The body of a German soldier lies in the main square of Place Du Marche after it was captured by US troops who landed in Omaha beach

Today, there is no sign of the damage caused by heavy shelling during D-Day although the buildings were rebuilt with a few subtle differences

However, in the weeks following D-Day French towns such as Caen suffered extensive damage as German defenders attempted to prevent the march on Berlin

Today, the Rue Saint-Pierre has been rebuilt and is enjoyed by shoppers and tourists

One photographer armed with a handful of D-Day photographs went out to find the original locations

Then, using the exact spot used 70 years ago, a new photograph of the same scene was taken

From troops loading in Weymouth, Dorset, to the aftermath of the battle for Caen there is a striking similarity
