An author and science journalist has described how the human race now has the technology and know-how to survive the kind of mass extinction that wiped out 95 per cent of the dinosaurs 250 million years ago.

Analee Newitz claims in her new book, Scatter, Adapt, and Remember: How Humans Will Survive a Mass Extinction, that we are now capable of spotting if a deadly asteroid is heading towards Earth, for example, and have the technology needed to survive in space if need be.

She adds that her theory was inspired by the Lystrosaurus - a pig-lizard dinosaur that survived the Great Dying by hiding in underground burrows and later adapted to the new environments it found itself in.

An author and science journalist has described how the human race now has the technology to ensure our survival for the next million years. She claims we will be thriving on a futuristic version of our planet, similar to the one depicted in this artist's impression, or be living in space

Lystrosaurus, which is Latin for shovel lizard lived around 250 million years ago in what is now Antarctica, India, and South Africa.

Up to six species are thought to still exist

Lystrosaurus was the most common dinosaur of the Early Triassic period.

It was previously thought it had 
features which  enabled it to adapt better than other animals at the time to survive the the mass extinction, called the Great Dying, which was caused by a drop in oxygen levels.

More recent theories claim it was able to survive by hiding in underground burrows.

Lystrosaurus was a heavily built plant eater roughly the size of a pig.

The forelimbs were even more robust than the hindlimbs, and the animal is thought to have been a powerful digger that would have helped it create these burrows.

Newitz's book also discounts the theories that we would choose to upload our brains to computers and survive in a virtual world.

Speaking to Yahoo News, Newitz said: 'I was learning about the survivors of the Great Dying. It was the worst mass extinction in Earth's history, caused by disastrous climate changes in the wake of a super volcano.

'And yet a humble little creature called Lystrosaurus managed to survive this horrific period. Pretty much every other animal on land went extinct.

'I figured that if this little pig-lizard could do it, so could we.'

She continues that the human race has a history of being able to survive environmental changes are we have proved how good we are at adapting to change.

According to Newitz, this has been helped by technological developments: 'If an asteroid were headed for Earth right now, we'd almost certainly see it coming several years out.

'We have space-based telescopes that are monitoring over 90 per cent of the nearby rocks that could hit us, and astronomers are constantly looking for more.

'All it would take are a few space probes of the kind we already have to go out into space, meet one of those asteroids, and just push it out of an intercept course with Earth.

Journalist Analee Newitz believes we now have the know-how to prevent the kind of mass extinction that wiped out 95 per cent of the dinosaurs. Her theory was inspired by the Lystrosaurus, pictured, which managed to endure the Great Dying by hiding underground and adapting to the new climate

'We also have the technology to build carbon-neutral cities and even carbon-neutral factories.

'It was surprising to me to realise how much of our planet's future really is in the hands of humanity.

'We don't need to wait for a miracle, or for a new scientific discovery. We just need to implement the knowledge and tools we already have. We can do it!'

Newitz is a strong advocate for exploring more of space and potentially setting up colonies on other planets using 'space elevators' to reach new planets.

This is becoming closer to reality through projects such as the Sabre rocket engine which was recently funded by the UK Government.

This engine can travel up to five times the speed of sound and could quickly and cheaply transport people into space in the near future. 

In her book, Newitz uses this theory to discount those made by futurists such as Google's Ray Kurzweil.

In her book, Analee Newitz believes the human race will survive by more actively exploring space

Kurzweil believes that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity.

The director of engineering at Google also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100.

Newitz responded to this by telling Yahoo News:'The most implausible ideas I encountered [while writing the book] were all about what humans would do in the long term instead of going into outer space.

'Humanity has a long history of exploring, starting a million years ago when our ancestors first left Africa.

'We are a species of tool-makers and explorers, and we're damn good at it. So I find it extremely unlikely that we would give up on exploring space.

'I think it's even more unlikely that we would choose to upload our brains to computers and live in virtual worlds instead of what we know as the physical world.

'I'm sure some people will do that, maybe temporarily while traveling through space, but just staying here on Earth when there are so many other awesome places to go? I found myself unable to accept it.'

When questioned about whether humans deserve to survive, Newitz said: 'Whether or not we deserve to persist isn't really relevant to whether we will do it.

'We have all the traits of a survival species, just like Lystrosaurus. Humans are life forms, and life forms always fight to survive, no matter what. It's in our most fundamental, biological natures.

'So we'd better accept that, and work on making the future as comfortable as possible.

'As human animals, we have evolved the ability to plan a better future for ourselves. We can even stop a mass extinction. We don't have to be angels to preserve our ecosystems. We just have to be practical, and not waste our time wondering whether we are good enough to deserve it.'

Ray Kurzweil, pictured, said that 'frail, biological parts' of human bodies will be replaced with 'non-biological' parts in the future. A theory that has been discounted by Analee Newitz
