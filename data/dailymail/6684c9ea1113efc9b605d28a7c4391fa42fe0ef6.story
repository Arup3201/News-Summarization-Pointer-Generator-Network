Papiss Cisse came off the bench and scored twice to rescue Newcastle from another ignominious defeat but the fans’ discontent with manager Alan Pardew remains evident and doubts about his future will continue.

Nikica Jelavic gave Hull the lead early in the second half with a stunning volley and Mohamed Diame hit a screamer to hand them what looked a decisive advantage. But Cisse’s heroics saved the day, and perhaps Pardew, certainly for now.

There were protests against him beforehand, in pubs and around the ground, but inside the stadium they were limited and sporadic, and the manager was grateful for that small mercy.

‘I have to say thank you to the fans for that,’ he said. ‘A lot of them took a neutral position. I don’t expect them to cheer for me but they took a position to support their club.’

Small bursts of protest peppered the game, from chants of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ from sections of Newcastle’s fans to ‘We want Pardew out!’ On a couple of occasions Pardew was required to kick or hit the ball back into play from touchline, and was jeered.

At 2-0 down a supporter with a piece of A4 paper adorned with an anti-Pardew slogan walked behind the dugout and shouted ‘Alan, Alan!’ to try to get Pardew to look up. He did not, and a steward shepherded the fan away. ‘It was a tough day,’ Pardew said. ‘But I’ve had to approach it as a normal working day.’ He accepted that some of the criticism had been merited given some recent results, such as last week’s 4-0 drubbing at Southampton.

‘We can’t moan about it because we’ve brought it on ourselves,’ he said.

He also said that the health crisis of Argentine midfielder Jonas Gutierrez, who revealed he is receiving treatment for testicular cancer, put matters into perspective. ‘Sometimes in desperate situations, like Jonas’s illness is, it can bind you together,’ Pardew said.

Yet the pre-match talk of the Toon was all about Pardew, mass protests, a dedicated website — SackPardew.com — to have him removed and of threats that 30,000 protest sheets and 100 huge banners would be on display. They were not, in the ground at least.

The fans’ reasons for wanting Pardew sacked include ‘increasingly poor results over the past two years’, his ‘deceit and empty promises’, ‘mismanagement of the club and the playing staff’ and ‘his misrepresentation of our hopes and expectations’.

Certainly, results have not been good. Since Newcastle beat Hull 4-1 in March in a match remembered for Pardew butting the midfielder, David Meyler, Newcastle have won just two of 15 Premier League games. In 24 league games played in the calendar year, they have failed to score in 15.

Newcastle started brightly yesterday and they had the first chance in the fifth minute after Yoan Gouffran’s run and Remy Cabella’s cross led to Emmanuel Riviere’s header, which flew over.

Gouffran and Cabella then combined to set up Jack Colback, whose shot was saved, and after a Moussa Sissoko run, Daryl Janmaat crossed from the right to Gouffran, whose header was also saved.

The home crowd began to get restless. Early dominance with no end product, allied with errors that were giving Hull chances, made them restless and in the 32nd minute the first loud, concerted chants of ‘We want Pardew out!’ began. Hull increased the tension in the 48th minute thanks to a magnificent finish by Jelavic who leapt into the air and smashed the ball home from 15 yards with his right foot after being fed a ball from his right.

‘We want Pardew out!’ roared the crowd.

Hull extended their lead in the 68th minute, courtesy of a second screamer, this one from Diame from 25 yards, that went in off a post.

‘You’re getting sacked in the morning,’ got another rancorous airing. Pardew, however, made what would prove to be a major substitution in the 69th minute, replacing Riviere with Cisse.

The sub scored his first goal after a fine pass from Cheik Tiote and his second, with three minutes left of normal time remaining, after a knockdown from Gouffran,

He lifted his shirt to show a message of support — for Gutierrez.

Hull manager Steve Bruce bemoaned the lost opportunity of three points away from home.

‘When you’re 2-0 up, it feels like a defeat to draw,’ he admitted. ‘We made terrible mistakes.’

He specified that goalkeeper Allan McGregor’s positioning was poor for Cisse’s first goal. The Scot certainly left a little too much room between himself and a post as Cisse slotted it through the gap.

Bruce also said one of his ‘kids’ got ‘caught out’ for the second — a reference to 20-year-old left-back Andrew Robertson failing to mark Gouffran properly with three minutes remaining, allowing the latter a knockdown across goal from a cross, right to the feet to Cisse, who scored.

‘At 2-0 up we should have seen it out,’ said Bruce, whose side also led twice before drawing 2-2 with West Ham last Monday. ‘We’ve been up four times in a week. It could have been a fantastic start to the season for us. Instead, it’s only been a decent one.’

Pardew’s side are no longer bottom, as they were at the start of play, if only because Crystal Palace and West Bromwich did not play.

The pressure is by no means off Pardew, but it has been alleviated ... at least for this week.
