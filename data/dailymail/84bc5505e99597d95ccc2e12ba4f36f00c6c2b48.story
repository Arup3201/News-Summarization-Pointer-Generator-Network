Multi-millionaire fraudster and Liberal Democrat donor Michael Brown has been arrested in the Dominican Republic after three years on the run, police said.

Brown was sentenced in his absence to seven years in jail after being convicted of fraud at Southwark Crown Court in 2008.

He donated about £2.4million to the Lib Dems ahead of the 2005 general election - the party's largest donation to date.

An international manhunt was launched when Brown went on the run after stealing £36million from clients, including nearly £8million from the former chairman of Manchester United.

He posed as a highly successful bond dealer and claimed connections with royalty to steal the money from Martin Edwards and others.

He secretly used investors' money to fund the record donation to the Lib Dems' 2005 election war chest and also blew a large slice of his ill-gotten gains on an 'extravagant' lifestyle.

Brown mixed freely with senior Lib Dem figures, and channelled his substantial cash gift to them through a company called 5th Avenue Partners.

The Electoral Commission investigated the affair but ruled the party did not have to hand back the money, which Lib Dem senior figures admitted had been spent anyway.

It emerged in September that police had tracked Brown to the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean nation neighbouring Haiti - which has no extradition treaty with Britain.

No Briton has ever been forced to return from
the Dominican Republic but prosecutors remain hopeful they can secure a
ground-breaking deal.

There is no guarantee that his latest arrest means he will face justice in the UK. Brown's former solicitor, Jamil Ahmed, would not disclose what he has been arrested for.

He said: 'He has been arrested but it is unrelated to what went on in the UK. It is nothing to do with previous convictions that were found against him.

'The arrest is not the doing of the UK police but they are likely to want to go over there and interview him or see him.'

Brown's escape before standing trial 
was facilitated by convicted drug smuggler Paul Nally, who gave him a 
fake passport and travelled with him to the Dominican Republic on June 
30, 2008, according to The Sunday Telegraph.

Nally
came back a week later, but Brown stayed and set up bank accounts and 
real estate ventures using a fake name – Darren P Nally.

He has been living a low-key life of luxury on the island, renting expensive properties and playing golf on exclusive courses.

A
photo from a golf club membership card revealed he has lost weight, 
grown a beard and allowed his blond-dyed hair to turn grey.

The whereabouts of his wife of 15 years, Sharon, remains a mystery.

Brown’s disappearance was only 
possible in the first place because another Lib Dem donor, Lord 
Strasburger, had put up the £250,000 bail money.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'The Electoral Commission inquiry in 2009 found that the party accepted the donation in good faith, and were in no way at fault.

'It cleared the party of all wrongdoing and accepted that at the time of the donation, Michael Brown was a permitted donor.

'There is no indication that the Electoral Commission will revise its opinion in this matter but any arrest abroad should lead to his extradition to the UK.'

A City of London Police spokesman said
yesterday: 'We are pleased to hear that Michael Brown has been detained
by authorities in the Dominican Republic, and are currently 
establishing contact with them to find out further details about his 
arrest.

'Clearly, at some stage we will look 
for his return to the United Kingdom, so he can serve the sentence for 
the fraud offences for which he has been convicted in this country.'
