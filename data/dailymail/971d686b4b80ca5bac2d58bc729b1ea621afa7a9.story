Labour MPs are said to be hatching a secret plot to stop the party brokering a coalition with Nicola Sturgeon's SNP

Labour MPs are hatching secret plans to wreck any deal with the Scottish Nationalists by holding an emergency summit after the Election.

A meeting of the entire Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) would be convened in order to veto any attempt by Mr Miliband to win Downing Street by brokering a deal with Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP.

Labour MPs say the possibility of forming an alliance with a party which wants to break up the UK is already alienating many of their core voters on both sides of the border.

John Cryer, chairman of the PLP, is understood to have told Mr Miliband’s aides that his MPs will not tolerate a repeat of the situation after the 2010 election, when Gordon Brown tried to stay in power by striking a deal with Nick Clegg, but without consulting his party.

Mr Miliband publicly insists his only concern is to achieve an outright Labour majority.

But plans are being made by senior Labour MPs, subject to security arrangements, for the PLP to meet inside the Commons on Sunday, May 10 – three days after the Election – if there is a hung Parliament.

A weekend meeting is highly unusual, but it would be the only chance for MPs to gather after all of the constituencies have declared, but before the start of negotiations to form a new Government. 

As the polls stand, Labour will not win enough seats to form an administration, and its only option might be to try to stitch together a three-way ‘grand coalition’ with the nationalists and Lib Dems.

The SNP – which currently has just six Westminster seats out of a total of 59 in Scotland – is on course to win as many as 56, mainly at Labour’s expense.

Although Mr Miliband insisted on Friday that talk of an agreement with the SNP was ‘a piece of nonsense’, he has stopped short of ruling it out. 

Last night, Labour MP Graham Stringer demanded that the leader listen to his party. ‘I do not think there is any way that the PLP would support a pact with the SNP because it would do such long-term damage to the party’s electability,’ he said.

‘We need to slam the door on a deal with the nationalists. It is not just harming our vote in Scotland – the prospect of an alliance with a party which wants to break up the UK is also hitting our prospects south of the border.’ 

Ed Miliband insisted that talk of an agreement with the SNP was 'nonsense' but stopped short of ruling it out  

Labour’s former Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, said on Thursday he did not know why his party had not ruled out a pact, adding that it ‘couldn’t possibly do a deal with a party that wants to be out of the United Kingdom and give up our nuclear deterrent’.

Labour nerves have been rattled by the successful launch of a new Tory campaign poster, which shows a miniature Ed Miliband in the top pocket of former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is expected to win a Westminster seat.

One Labour MP told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We will not tolerate coalition negotiations taking place above [our] heads again, and certainly not if it means getting into bed with the SNP ... This has been accepted in principle by Miliband’s office.’

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Our focus is on one thing and one thing only: a majority. We don’t need, don’t want and are not planning for a coalition.’

Mr Cryer was not available for comment.
