The horse doesn’t look happy and the portly new leader appears to be stuck in a tank hatch, but North Korea officials are obviously keen to show that anything Vladimir Putin can do, their man can do better.

The secretive state has released a series of he-man images of Kim Jong Un, along with a video showing him driving the tank on a snow-covered road.

The images were taken in 2009, and are strikingly similar to photos of the Russian leader in recent years, although Mr Putin tends to go topless.

Putin (pictured below) on holiday in 2007

When Putin wants to show the Russian 
public his mettle, he wastes no time in leaping aboard a stallion, 
hunting big cats, or working out with special forces soldiers.

Now North Korea's young new leader 
has taken a leaf out of the Russian strongman's playbook, by 
broadcasting footage of his own manful moves on state television.

Kim Jong Un was recently named supreme
Army commander and has pledged to uphold his late father Kim Jong Il’s 
‘military first’ policy.

The documentary, broadcast to viewers
in the world's only ever hereditary communist dictatorship, seemed to 
show that Kim Jong Un was ready succeed his father, Kim Jong Il, who 
died of a heart attack last month.

The son, who is in his late 20s, has moved swiftly into the role of 'supreme leader' of the people, the ruling Workers' Party and the country's 1.2million-strong military.

But there have been questions about how prepared the young Kim is to lead the country, with only a few years of grooming behind him.

His father, in contrast, had been 
through 20 years of training when his father, North Korea founder Kim Il
Sung, died of a heart attack in 1994.

Sunday's
footage - shown on a day believed to be Kim Jong Un's birthday - 
confirmed that he was being groomed as early as 2009 to succeed Kim Jong
Il.

It shows him riding a galloping steed,
navigating a tank, observing fighter jets and firing exercises and 
imperiously addressing troops.

He
is shown seated in the tank's cockpit and speaking to officers with the
hatch cover open. He later drove it on a snow-covered road as his 
father watched from a reviewing stand.

The footage is reminiscent of photo 
opportunities orchestrated by Putin who, in the past few years, has 
posed for cameras hunting in Siberia, participating in judo 
competitions, and making archaelogical discoveries while diving with 
troops.

The Russian PM, who is a former KGB agent, has also posed with biker gangs, in the cockpit of firefighting aircraft and on the race track, driving sports cars.

For two years, North Koreans were told
that Kim Jong Un, who graduated from Kim Il Sung Military University, 
was a military genius, Pyongyang residents have said.

Today's
documentary said Kim Jong Un had undergone intensified military 
training, and showed fighter jets tearing through the skies, and 
soldiers jumping out of planes with parachutes and firing 
multiple-rocket launchers.

It cited Kim Jong Il as saying, 'Our general resembles me. ... I sometimes admire his strong belief, resolve and gut.'

Kim
is also quoted as saying his son has 'outstanding strategies and is 
well-versed in military tactics. ... He is a man of many abilities and 
the genius among the geniuses.'

Ominously, the younger Kim is also seen shaking hands with officials at a satellite control centre after scientists launched a missile test in April 2009 - and saying he was ready to declare war if the missile had been shot down.

That test firing stoked regional tensions and earned North Korea international sanctions and condemnation.

'I had decided to wage a real war if the enemies shot down' the rocket, Kim Jong Un was quoted as saying.

A voice-over described Kim Jong Il as 
saying his son was in charge of the military's anti-rocket interception 
operations at the time.

North
Korea has said it successfully sent a satellite into orbit as part of a
peaceful bid to develop its space program. U.S. and South Korean 
officials, however, said no satellite or other object reached orbit, and
accused the North of using the launch to test its long-range missile 
technology.

At the time, Japan had threatened to 
shoot down any debris from the rocket if the launch went awry. U.S. 
lawmakers also urged their military to shoot the rocket down.

Kim Jong Un's intentions as leader of North Korea are deemed crucial because the country is locked in a long-running standoff over its nuclear ambitions and is grappling with chronic food shortages.

North Korea has tested two atomic devices and is believed to be working toward mounting a bomb on a missile capable of reaching the U.S.

After years of acrimony, Pyongyang and Washington had begun discussions about food aid and how to restart nuclear disarmament talks that were suspended when Kim died last month.

The U.S. and North Korea fought on opposite sides of the 1950-53 Korean War, and do not have formal diplomatic relations.

Since Kim Jong Il's death on December 17, the process to install his son as leader has been quick, with top military and party officials wasting no time in pledging their loyalty to the third Kim to lead the nation of 24million since it was founded in 1948.

Another documentary aired a week ago 
showed Kim Jong Un visiting a premier tank division with strong 
historical and family ties in the first solo inspection trip made after 
his father's death.

Kim Jong Un, who was recently named supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, has pledged to uphold Kim Jong Il's 'military first' policy.

He is believed to have turned 28 or 29 on Sunday, though his exact birth date has not been confirmed by the government.

The birthdays of his father and grandfather are considered the nation's most important holidays, but Kim Jong Un's birthday has not been declared a national holiday.
