A private investigator helping in the case of missing Louisiana college student Michaela ‘Mickey’ Shunick believes that he may have information about a possible suspect.

John Abdella, who was hired by private donors to solve the mystery, said since last Monday, he has received 265 calls related to Shunick’s disappearance.

About five days ago, Abdella said two independent sources who do not know each other phoned in tips describing the same person.

Vanished: Miss Shunick, 22, was last seen riding her bike home from a friend's house in the early hours when she disappeared

‘Their description was almost identical,’ Abdella told TV station KATC.

‘They appear to be very credible and 
they appear to be very knowledgeable,’ he continued. ‘And I thought it 
was more than coincidental that both of their descriptions were the 
same.’

P.I.: John Abdella said he has received 265 calls about the Shunick case, including two credible leads

The private investigator said he plans to meet with police to share his information about the leads.

‘Hopefully, it takes us somewhere in the next couple of days,’ said Shunick’s sister, Charlie.

‘Everything we are doing, everything 
that’s going on here, everything people are doing is to find Mickey. It 
has nothing to do with anything else. Our goal is to find my sister,’ 
Charlie Shunick added.

Evidence:
The recovered bike belonging to missing student Mickey Shunick since May 19 was found with significant damage suggesting a possible hit and run police say

Abdella said he believes that the Lafayette police are working hard to find Shunick, aged 22, who disappeared in May while riding her bicycle home from her friend’s house in the middle of the night.

Shunick’s bicycle was found on May 30 badly mangled under a bridge about 30 minutes from the spot where she disappeared. At the time, police suggested that she may have been hit by a car.

‘It’s a very active investigation,’ said Abdella. ‘And I think the police are very, very active, they are putting in a lot of manpower, they’re spending a lot of overtime.’

Discovery: Just over a week after she vanished her bike was discovered beneath this bridge, 27 miles from where she was last seen, with police initially tight-lipped on its found condition

Tire marks: Near the bike, police also say they found tire marks from a vehicle that was driving off the road's side leading police to believe the vehicle placed the bike there

On the day Shunick's bike was found, police have 
also revealed their discovery of off-road tire tracks nearby.

'We strongly believe that the person, or perpetrator, drove down to the edge of the water and dumped the bike into the water for it not to be found, Cpl. Paul Mouton, of the Lafayette Police Department, told ABC.

Police report that they're currently searching for the drivers of three vehicles seen passing around the same time and area she was seen riding in security footage.

The vehicles are a white pickup truck with a bed cover, a white four-door Chevy Z71 truck, and an older model sedan.

Two videos show the University of Louisiana student on St John Street and St Landry Street in Lafayette date from 1.47am and 1.48am when the student had left a friend's house.

It was over a week after her disappearance that fishermen found her bike at Whiskey Bay on the Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. Her family were brought to the scene by police and confirmed it was her black and gold Schwinn.

The bike's condition was initially not released while authorities began searching the river by boat with divers planned when the current became less strong. 

DNA testing: Police hope that forensic tests on her bike's handlebars, frame and grips will find DNA evidence to any potential suspects in her disappearance

Investigators had found no cell phone or purse of the missing woman after she left her friend Brettly Wilson's house.

And as investigators expanded their search to include a $25,000 reward for information, some people in the area began to wonder whether she had even been abducted.

Reward: While search efforts have been called off among her friends, a 
$25,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to her 
whereabouts

While hundreds of University of 
Louisiana students and some of Shunick's friends have been helping the 
police with their searches, the night she went missing still plays on 
minds.

'It's something you 
keeping asking ourselves, if there's something that we overlooked or 
something that we missed,' said Brettley Wilson.

Painting a clearer timeline of the 
evening, police are keen for witnesses to come forward from the 
Artmosphere bar that Shunick attended from 10pm till midnight and then 
onwards to Wilson's house and to a Taco Bell drive-thru at around 1.24am.

Receiving a phone call from a friend at around 1.31 am, Wilson drove Shunick to his home to collect her bike and she rode off at 1.45 am leaving Wilson.

Support: The community in Lafayette attend a vigil to pray for the missing student

'She checked her bike, took out her 
mace, made sure it was on. I walked her out, watched her get to the 
drive way then I closed the door and locked it,' said Wilson according 
to KATC

That was the last time that anyone saw her.

'Now we're able to show the family 
that, hey, we know she traveled to Versaille, we know she made it as far
as St.Landry Street, and that there was a white pick up truck in that 
area,' said Corporal Paul Mouton, Public Information Officer for 
Lafayette Police.

'Someone was in that immediate area when she passed on the bike so it's trying to identify with those people and getting that information back so we can hopefully get closer to finding her.'

Indeed, after seeing the white pick-up truck released by the police, new leads are already coming forward.

Shine a light: Friends and fellow students gathered in a park in downtown Lafayette to support Mickey's family in the search for her

Hope: Large-scale search efforts for Mickey, seen here (right) with her sister, have concluded while family and friends remain hopeful for her recovery

A local girl, Tasha Patterson claims 
that it is the same truck that approached her two months ago while she 
was riding her bike down South College around 2 pm.

She says that after heading back from a meeting a man in a white truck pulled over and asked if she needed a ride.

Patterson says she was exhausted and was not thinking clearly and got in.

Throughout the car ride the man apparently offered her money in return for sex, an offer which she refused.

Dropping her off unharmed, Patterson described the truck as a white GMC Sierra 2500 Texas Edition and during the journey told her matter-of-factly that: 'He rides around town all the time trying to pick up pretty girls'.

The driver was described as white, heavyset and in his 50's or 60's.
