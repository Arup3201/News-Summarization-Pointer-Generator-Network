Rising star: A young Elvis Presley in the recording studio. The contract he signed with music impresario Colonel Tom Parker is to go under the hammer

Fans of Elvis will be all shook up to hear that the very first contract signed by the rock and roll star is to go under the hammer this week.

The agreement between Presley and his ruthless manager, Colonel Tom Parker, signed at Sun Records' studio in Memphis, Tennessee, came just before the singer rocketed to international superstardom.

It was also the beginning of a relationship between the two men that was to last until Presley's death, and which was heavily criticised when investigations into the star's estate began.

The sale of the document is being 
handled by Julien's Auctions of Los Angeles, California, but the auction
 itself will be held at the Hard Rock Café in New York City on Saturday,
 May 17.

It's estimated to reach anything up to $25,000.

Presley's career began in 1954 when he joined Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee, and recorded 24 songs.

Word
 started to spread throughout the industry of a talented young singer 
and in February 1955, Col Parker, who had already had some success in 
talent management since the late-1930s, made his approach.

Presley
 initially agreed to let 'the Colonel', as he was known, organise some 
of his future bookings and promotions and gradually he became known as 
his 'special advisor.'

In 
November that year, Col Parker successfully persuaded RCA Victor to buy 
Presley's contract out from Sun Records for $40,000 - an almost unheard 
of sum in those days.

Fatefully, it also guaranteed the Colonel a 25 per cent commission on the young star's gross income.

After Presley signed the official agreement his career went from strength to strength and it was with RCA Victor he released his most famous tracks, including Heartbreak Hotel, Hound Dog, Love Me Tender, Jailhouse Rock, Blue Suede Shoes and All Shook Up.

The document has survived the last 59 years in pristine condition - just slightly yellowing - and features signatures by Elvis and his parents Vernon and Gladys Presley.

Darren Julien, chief executive of Julien's Auctions, said: 'This is one of the most significant contracts, the one that Elvis signed with Col. Tom Parker.

'Before that, I believe he was working with his mother.

'This was the start of his life and it was a very important decision in his career, and it was a very historical moment for his parents, who were there when he signed the contract.

'Col. Parker was Elvis's manager for the majority of his career and pretty much all of his big hits were released while they were working together.

'There was a lot of controversy surrounding Col. Parker and the relationship he had with Elvis. He was very controlling and had a lot of influence over him.

'He controlled his finances and it was because of him that Elvis never performed in Europe, as he didn't like Elvis flying.

'Although a lot of people say Col. Parker was controlling of Elvis, he actually helped make Elvis into the superstar he was.

'This contract has never been offered publicly and it is a really rare item.

'It's in very good condition and it's estimated to fetch up to $15,000 but I think it could get $25,000 because it's so significant.'
