From Pam Hogg to Kenzo, outfits created from mesh fabric were one of the quirkiest trends seen on the autumn/winter 2013 catwalk.

The airy and sporty material encapsulates the season’s grungey and sports luxe vibes and is already loved by celebrities like Rihanna, Cara Delevingne and Miley Cyrus.

And now Versace has taken the trend one step further by creating full mesh bodysuits ... for boys.

Sexy? The mesh design will set you back £97, but will anyone actually wear it?

The breathable, barely-there suits are being sold for a hefty £97 online by the luxury designer.

Modelled by a bearded model, the suits feature the iconic Versace branding on a flattering waistline and even a special pouch designed to conceal a man's modesty.

Whilst the design is clearly aimed at fashion-forward males, it is unlikely that we are likely to see the likes of David Beckham and Harry Styles wearing one anytime soon.
