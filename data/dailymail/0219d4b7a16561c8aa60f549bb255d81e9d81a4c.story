The average house in the UK now costs £250,000, after doubling in just 12 years.

It means half of buyers now have to pay 3 per cent stamp duty, raising fears about the impact on the property market.

Prices in London are up more than 13 per cent in a year, but outside the capital and the South East there was a more modest rise of only 3.8 per cent.

The average UK house price hit £254,000 in January, while prices in London topped £450,000

London is powering ahead of the rest of the country, with prices up 13.2 per cent in a year

In a further blow to those struggling to get on the property ladder, prices are rising faster for first-time buyers as demand for starter homes outstrips supply.

In particular, the government's Help to Buy scheme aimed at people wanting to own their first home, has seen thousands of people flood the market, driving up prices.

In January prices for those buying their first home were up 7.6 per cent, compared with 6.5 per cent for owner-occupiers, the Office for National Statistics said.

House prices grew by 7.1 per cent in England, 6.9 per cent in Wales, 1.4 per cent in Scotland and 2.7 per cent in Northern Ireland.

The average price in the UK now stands at £254,000. In England the average home costs £264,000, £166,000 in Wales, £132,000 in Northern Ireland and £183,000 in Scotland.

The ONS said: ‘London continues to be the English region with the highest average house price at £458,000 and the North East had the lowest average house price at £147,000.

‘London, the South East and the East of England all had prices higher than the UK average price of £254,000.

‘Excluding London and the South East, the average UK mix-adjusted house price was £196,000.’

House prices are now well above the pre-crash peak, raising fears of a new bubble

In January 2014 the average price paid
 for a house by a first-time buyer was £190,000, while people already on
 the property ladder paid £291,000.

It also emerged today that in February mortgage lending leapt by around 50 on a year ago.

High street banks said they had seen rising confidence and a broadening appetite for loans.

Gross
 mortgage borrowing of £11.5 billion recorded during the month was 47 
per cent higher than in February 2013 and at the highest level since 
August 2008, according to the British Bankers' Association (BBA).

Some
 47,550 mortgages worth £7.7 billion were approved for people buying a 
home last month, which is a 53 per cent increase on the same month last 
year, the BBA's report said.

The
 latest number of approvals for house purchase is slightly down on a 
six-year high of over 49,000 recorded in January, but it is still the 
second highest monthly figure recorded since October 2007.

The BBA said that mortgage support schemes are continuing to free up more housing chains and prompt further bursts in activity.

Average rises of 6.8 per cent are the highest for three years, but still below peaks seen in 2010

The Help to Buy scheme was launched last year to help credit-worthy people to move on or up the housing ladder with deposits as low as 5 per cent.

The Government announced last week that the first phase of Help to Buy, which is an equity loan scheme launched last spring to specifically support people buying a new-build home, will be extended to the end of the decade.

BBA chief economist Richard Woolhouse said: ‘These encouraging figures show that the demand for finance is broadening out across both the consumer and commercial markets, with mortgage approvals and lending to many types of business on the up.

‘Mortgage lending has leapt 50 per cent since this time last year, whilst we are now beginning to see growth in net lending to manufacturers and retailers.

‘This shows that the banks are helping businesses who are looking to invest as well as ordinary home buyers as part of their sustained support for recovery across the economy.’
