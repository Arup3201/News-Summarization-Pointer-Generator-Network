Scotland's Martin Laird neatly summed up the challenge of Royal Aberdeen after a rollercoaster third round in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.

Laird made the halfway cut with just a shot to spare after rounds of 70 and 73, but in a packed field was just seven off the overnight lead shared by fellow Scot Marc Warren, Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg and Argentina's Ricardo Gonzalez.

When he raced to the turn in 31 with five birdies in eight holes the US-based 31-year-old was just two off the pace, but a back nine of 39 meant he had to settle for a 70 and level-par total of 213.

'It was a tale of two nines,' said Laird, who claimed his third PGA Tour title in the Valero Texas Open last year, a closing 63 holding off the challenge of Rory McIlroy.

'I finally took advantage of the front nine with the best golf I have played in a long time, but the back nine is very, very hard. I made one bad swing and picked one bad club and it cost me four shots.

'Even if I had shot one over and got in at three or four under I would be in a good position to try and win the tournament tomorrow.'

McIlroy had taken 40 shots to cover the back nine in his second round of 78 and with the wind blowing in the same direction, Laird added: 'I'm not going to be the only one. Everyone is making birdies on the front nine and struggling on the back.'

Half of the tee times had been delayed by 20 minutes due to mist rolling in from the North Sea, meaning overnight leaders Kristoffer Broberg, Ricardo Gonzalez and Marc Warren were just beginning their third rounds.

The trio had been joined at the top of the leaderboard when Sweden's Robert Karlsson also went to the turn in 31, but the former European number one then ran up a double-bogey six on the 13th.

Playing partner McIlroy, whose run of poor Friday performances after excellent opening rounds continues to be a mystery, had recovered from a three-putt bogey on the first with four birdies to lie just three off the lead on three under.

And defending champion Phil Mickelson was also three under after following a bogey on the fourth with a birdie on the next and eagle on the par-five sixth.
