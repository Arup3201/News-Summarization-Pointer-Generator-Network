Brazil's third-place play-off against Holland on Saturday was a chance for a redemption following their jaw-dropping 7-1 humiliation to Germany in the World Cup semi-finals.

However, in Brasilia the horror show continued as they were comprehensively swept aside 3-0 by a far superior Dutch team.

Goals from Robin van Persie, Daley Blind and Georgino Wijnaldum completed a miserable few days for the hosts as they try to repair their footballing reputation.

Here, Sportsmail dissects how Brazil's media have reacted to the 3-0 defeat.

Condemned: Brazil have been critisiced by their media following their third-place play-off defeat to Holland

On the mark: Holland captain Robin van Persie gave them the lead with an early penalty in Brasilia

Double trouble: Daley Blind put Holland 2-0 ahead with his first ever goal for his country

Three and easy: Georgino Wijnaldum (centre) completed the 3-0 third-place play-off victory for Holland

Correio na Copa leads with the damning headline 'Ridiculous' following the loss to Louis van Gaal's side.

The paper continues with: 'After humilation against Germany, the Selecao suffers a blackout in the third place play-off and says goodbye to the tournament in a melancholy way.'

The hosts were much fancied to win a record sixth World Cup, especially following their Confederations Cup success last year, but arguably have regressed since their 3-0 victory against Spain in that final.

Correio's summarisation is an accurate reflection amongst the Brazilian papers as Agora Sao Paulo headlines with 'Knockout!'

Alongside that a picture of David Luiz accompanies the front of the newspaper - as the defender again had a torrid time at the heart of the World Cup hosts defence.

Agora continues it's scathing criticism of Brazil's performance by stating that Scolari's side are a mere 'punching bag for the big teams' after conceding 10 goals and scoring just once in their last two matches.
