Yesterday details of Poundworld's latest bargain brassiere sent shoppers in to a spin as the company boasted that it expected to sell over one million units.

Featuring a sensible design and a £1 price tag the nylon bra may lack the style and sex appeal of costlier rivals but is expected to fly off the shelves after trials of the ‘comfort bra’ in selected shops last weekend proved a huge success, with almost 100,000 snapped up in hours.

Poundworld bosses are expecting to sell
over one million units by introducing the design in more than 200 branches 
nationwide, where it will be sold alongside their more established 
ranges of sweets, toys and toiletries.

The bra comes in black, white and nude
nylon and sizes range from medium to extra large and the manufacturer 
claims the curve-hugging design gives women the perfect fit and a smooth
shape with no bumps or lumps.

But does it really work? And will any woman with a bust size bigger than an A cup actually wear it? We asked banker Jessica Smith, 26, from Oxford and Cassie Williams, a 33-year-old barrister and mother-of-three from Leeds, to take it for a spin.

Tried and tested: Jessica Smith gave the £1 bra a spin, but what did she think?

Jump around: Jessica said the bra was quite supportive so may be ideal for the gym

Jessica, who admits that she normally wears lingerie that offers a lot more, wasn't impressed.

She said: 'It's more of a top than a bra. Surprisingly the fabric feels fine, not too cheap and nasty, but I'm not convinced. Normally the only thing I buy in pound shops is bleach.'

When asked if she would wear it after the trial in the MailOnline offices she said: 'Absolutely no way, it's not very sexy is it?'

'My verdict is, it's not at all sexy, but I might possibly wear it for the gym because the support is OK.'

Not so sexy: 'It's not very sexy is it?' retorted Jessica whilst donning the bra

'Comfort wise, it's wonderful. It feels like you're not wearing anything, which I think is part of the problem. I like my bras to do something!'

'But it is great value for money,' she added.

Cassie Williams, a 33-year-old barrister and mother-of-three, however, was impressed.

She described the bra, which comes in black, white and nude nylon, as packaged in a simple way not unlike many you see in supermarkets.

She said: 'It is a crop top/sports bra style. I have 38E breasts so chose the XL which is sized as 16-18.

'It was plenty big enough to cover me. Very easy to put on. The material is soft and comfortable but fairly thin (this could cause some embarrassment in cold weather!).

Road test: The bras are only available in black, white or nylon and are expected to sell millions

Supportive: As Jessica jumped around, she agreed that the bra was very supportive

Flattering? The bra claims to be flattering and help with posture but Jessica felt like she wasn't wearing anything at all

'It only offers modest support - a quick skip across the garden with my 3-year-old daughter made it clear that any running in it would cause too much discomfort.

Tried and tested: Cassie Williams, a 33-year-old barrister and mother-of-three, put the £1 bra to the test and she was impressed

'Having said that, I have a large chest and it gave a relatively decent lift and cleavage so I expect a smaller breasted woman would be more suited to it.'

The manufacturer claims the curve-hugging design gives women the perfect fit and a smooth shape with no bumps or lumps.

Cassie said: 'It's not the prettiest bra but that style of bra never is in my opinion.

'I wouldn't wear it to feel sexy but it isn't ugly.

'I was wearing it on a very warm day and it didn't feel uncomfortable or cause me to feel too warm.'

Cassie, who normally buys bras from Marks and Spencer's Limited collection or Autograph range (Poundworld boasts that its bra is £14 cheaper than the lowest-priced Marks & Spencer rival), concluded: 'For £1 I was impressed I have to say.

'I've tried on bras in that style when pregnant (as you can't have underwire) at a cost of £10-£15 and it was on a par with them.

'It says to hand wash which is a bit inconvenient and I haven't washed it to know how it would hold up but it looks relatively well made.

'If you are on a budget and you don't need too much support I'd say give it a go!'

The retailer admits it will make a loss on 
the product, but hopes it will lure more women into its stores.

However, it cannot claim to be the 
cheapest bra to go on sale in the UK. Two years ago, the 99p Stores 
chain sold a padded bra with decorative bow in 150 branches nationwide.

It's a no from me: Jessica said she would 'absolutely never wear the bra'

Tried and tested: The new bra has been trialled in selected stores and will go on sale nationwide today

Cheap cheap: The bra is £14 cheaper than Marks and Spencer's cheapest support bra and targets cash-strapped women
