For years the Les Rois hotel in the Egyptian resort of Hurghada offered guests the chance to enjoy a little tipple under the Red Sea sun.

Men and women could mingle over a G&T at the rooftop pool bar or enjoy a pint downstairs in the English 'pub'.

But last weekend, to cheers of 'God is Great', the owners poured the entire contents of their drinks cabinet down the the drain and declared Les Rois the resort's first official alcohol-free hotel.

Alcohol free: The owners of Les Rois hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada are hoping to attract more conservative Muslim guests

And in a bid to further woo an increasingly important conservative Muslim clientele, they have created men-only floors and made the rooftop pool a women-only area patrolled by female security officers.

While most mainstream Islamic scholars also agree that Islam forbids alcohol consumption, the changes appear to have garnered a mixed response.

Last orders: The hotel owners pour bottles of booze down the drain

'Excellent step!' read one tweet.

'The signs of the revolution are starting to appear in Egypt', read another.

However other observers were less impressed - 'A hotel without liquor? Definitely a silly achievement for the president,' posted one indignant observer.

The decision reflects deeper changes in Egypt following the 2011 uprising and the fall of Hosni Mubarak.

Under President Mohamed Morsi's Muslim brotherhood alcohol restrictions have been tightened, segregated areas are springing up and citizens must declare the religion on their state ID cards.

But tourism, for years the mainstay of the Egyptian economy, appears to be suffering, with the number of western visitors falling.

Around 14.5 million people visited Egypt in 2010, accounting for 10 percent of economic activity and earning the country $12.5 billion.

But visitors numbers fell to around 9.8 million the following year, reflecting political turmoil at the time, and have yet to recover to anywhere close to pre-revolution levels.

One Hurghada hotel owner reported numbers down by as much as 50 per cent.

The decision to go alcohol free can be seen as a move to attract more tourists from conservative middle-eastern states, who do not feel comfortable around boozy westerners.

Hotel manager Abdelbasset Omar told the Guardian: 'At the moment many Middle Eastern men won't come to Hurghada because they won't get the privacy they require.

'We're trying to fill that gap in the market.'

In March the Egyptian government 
doubled beer tax to 200 per cent and increased wine tax from 100 per 
cent to 150 per cent. Alcohol was also banned from airport duty-free 
shops.

That followed 
the announcement of plans in February to ban the sale of alcohol in 
certain areas outside Cairo and to stop renewing alcohol licences.

'The previous regime would not have allowed this kind of hotel, because such a hotel wouldn't have reflected the image that Mubarak would have wanted for Egypt,' Hotel owner Omar added.

While the hotel has even gone so far as to remove pictures of western singers Elvis Presley and Shakira from the walls, a few things appear to have slipped the net.

The website still boasts a poolside bar and an English 'pup' (SIC) and pornographic movies are still available on the pay-per-view TV system.

But as Egypt continues to become more conservative it's almost certain other hotels with be following Les Rois
