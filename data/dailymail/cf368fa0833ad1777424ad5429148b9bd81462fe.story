George Clooney's wedding to Amal Alamuddin in Venice last month was one of the most high-profile matrimonies of the decade. 

The glamorous couple - who exchanged vows on September 27 at a star studded Italian ceremony - were the toast of Hollywood, especially when the wedding photographs emerged a few days later showing the newlyweds looking every inch the A-listers we’d come to expect.

So impressed with the new couple's wedding look were the British public that they're seeking cosmetic treatments in a desperate attempt to emulate the glamorous pair.

Influencers: George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin only tied the knot a few weeks ago but they're already influencing cosmetic surgery trends

A  London clinic that specialises in non-surgical cosmetic treatments has reported a rise in couples seeking pre-wedding makeovers after 53-year-old George and Amal, who recently turned 36, tied the knot.

The official wedding snaps - first seen in Hello! magazine - have reportedly had brides-to-be asking for a flat stomach like Amal and grooms wanting smooth skin like George, according to cosmetic doctor, Dr Ohan Ohanes, from Swiss Care Clinic.

'Since the Clooney wedding hit the covers of magazines and newspapers across the UK we’ve had enquiries about body contouring and anti-ageing skin treatments,' explains skin expert Dr Ohanes.

'Patients were asking for "the Amal look" but soon we started receiving a high number of enquiries from couples looking to emulate both of the Clooney’s flawless appearances,' he said. 

The cosmetic doctor, who says the London clinic has seen a 150 per cent rise in couples looking into non-surgical treatments like body contouring and dermal fillers, says his patients have actually stated George and Amal as their pre-marital makeover inspiration.

'We’ve had patients turn up at the clinic clutching the wedding photographs of the Clooneys,' he told MailOnline. 'Once you start getting enquiries from couples asking for treatments that emulate the look of a celebrity pair, there’s no doubt a trend is forming.'

According to Dr Ohanes, his female patients are choosing non-surgical fat reduction treatments to get Amal’s arms and flat stomach, while youthful George’s smooth, firm skin is appealing to the men.

'So far we’ve had couples choosing his-and-hers Exilis Elite fat reduction to shrink and sculpt certain body parts, especially the stomach,' he explained. 'We’re finding the grooms are more interested in anti-ageing facial treatments, which is something we usually associate with our female patients more.

'I’ve never seen anything like it to be honest,' Dr Ohanes concluded. 'We’ve had more couples enquire about injectables and body shaping after the Clooney wedding than I ever had about Kim Kardashian and her enviable curves.'
