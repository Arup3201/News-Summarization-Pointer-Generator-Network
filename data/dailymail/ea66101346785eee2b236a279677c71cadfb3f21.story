A man was out to get more than just an eyeful at an iconic nudist beach but his plans were laid bare after sunbathers spotted he was using a hidden camera inside an esky to film them.  

Unlike the other sunbathers at Adelaide's Maslin Beach, it was suspected that he actually had something to hide, so he was chased down by around eight people and surrounded before police arrived.

9 News reported the man first aroused suspicion when he was spotted positioning his esky towards an unclad couple at Maslin Beach on December 21.

Sunbathers at Maslin Beach in Adelaide chased down and surrounded a man they suspected was secretly filming them from a camera hidden inside an esky

A female sunbather walked past and noticed the naked truth when she claimed she saw a video camera set up inside the esky. The video camera was apparently filming through some holes in the esky's wooden frame.

Except for wearing an Akubra hat and a smile, the man was also naked and aged in his late 40s or early 50s. After being challenged the man moved several hundred metres down the beach. But in a flash he again pointed his esky towards another couple.

A group of about eight people then began to chase the man, calling out 'he's got a camera', and surrounded him until police arrived.

Maslin's iconic nudist beach in South Adelaide was the scene of a citizen's arrest by sunbathers 

South Coast Police examined the camera in the man's possession and no recorded vision was found.

Police spoke with the man and investigated the allegations that he was filming people at the beach.

These enquiries and the absence of vision led police to determine there was insufficient evidence to support a charge of indecent filming. The man was cautioned and was asked to leave the beach.

The southern section of Maslin Beach was designated as Australia’s first nude beach in 1975.
