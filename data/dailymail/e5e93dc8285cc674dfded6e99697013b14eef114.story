This high flying daredevil pulled a series of incredible stunts for the camera as he perched on a rope 1000ft above the ground.

Florian Ebner, 23, performs jumps, back flips and other fearless moves - even though a fall from such a dizzying height could be fatal.

His amazing antics, shot in the picturesque Dolomites in Austria, were captured by keen adventure photographer Martin Lugger, a finalist in the 2013 Red Bull Illume photography contest.

Mr Lugger, from Lienze, Austria, said: 'We always had the idea of a highline image set in the Austrian Dolomites - the highline is highlighted by the extraordinary beauty of this perfect spot.

'The light and mood increased with the sunset - Mr Ebner got a good start and did one move after the other turning it into a perfect evening.

'We go here quite a lot to climb, hike or ski. Thomas Gaisbacher, a mountain guide and professional skier lives in the Dolomites itself and fixed the line for Florian.'

Slacklining is seen as distinct from tightrope walking because the line is not taut. It is instead stretchy and bouncy, allowing acrobatic feats

He added: 'To fix the line you have to drill hooks into the rock on several spots. The slackline gets fixed on these hooks and has to be tensioned strongly.

'To be on the safe side there is an extra rope fixed to these hooks. It is fixed underneath the slackline with a little duct tape every few metres.

'Usually the athlete wears a harness to fix himself to the slackline and rope so it's as safe as possible. But either way there is a high and fatal risk on any climb.'

It is not the same as tightrope walking as the bounciness of the rope allows jumps, flips and other acrobatics
