David Axelrod, President Obama's former senior campaign advisor, criticised the showing of 'shoot em up' video game adverts after the NFL game

President Obama's top strategist has taken to Twitter to condemn the showing of violent video games during the NFL game in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy.

David Axelrod, President Obama's former senior campaign advisor, criticised the showing of 'shoot em up' video game adverts during the game after 26 people - 20 of them children - were slaughtered in Connecticut in what is the worst school shooting in American history.

He wrote: 'In NFL post-game: an ad for shoot 'em up video game. All for curbing weapons of war. But shouldn't we also quit marketing murder as a game?'

Adam Lanza, 20, broke into the school and mercilessly opened fire with two handguns and semi-automatic assault rifle.

All of Lanza's child massacre victims were first-graders, aged six or seven.

Seven adults, six women who worked at the school, plus Lanza's mother also died at his hands, before he killed himself.

It is believed American politicians will discuss possible legislation to ban rifles and assault weapons with high-capacity clips like those used during the massacre inthe coming weeks.

The nation's addiction to guns is likely to be addressed in coming weeks as new numbers reveal that more than 2 million guns were purchased in America in November.

The President visited the scene of the tragedy yesterday.

He told the families of those killed: 'You are not alone in your grief. Our world too has been torn apart,' President Obama said.

During his speech he made several references to the prospective legal battles that will come as politicians fight for tougher restrictions on guns in the wake of the shooting.

He would not be drawn on specific plans, but took aim at the arguments made by activists who point to the Second Amendment's right to bear arms as a reason to keep guns accessible.

'Are we prepared to say that such violence visited upon our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?' he said.

'All across this land our world too has been torn apart. All across this land we wept with you and pulled our children tight. Newtown, you are not alone.'

In one of the most religious speeches of his presidency, Mr Obama talked about how the ultimate goal for a society is to protect their children.

'If we don't get that right, we don't get anything right. By that measure, can we truly say as a nation that we are doing our obligations?' he said.
