The publisher of a Dorset guide has had to bin the front cover - after copies pictured the wrong town.

Local Authority Publishing's guide to landlocked Dorchester featured a photo on the front of Weymouth Harbour - eight miles to the south.

The error has upset some local residents and businesses who called the blunder 'ludicrous' and 'a joke'.

The group said the error, which has upset and bemused some local residents and businesses in Dorchester (pictured), has 'been corrected and finished copies would now be distributed'

A picture of Weymouth Harbour was put on the front of the guide - even though it is eight miles from Dorchester

The publisher said its booklet has since 'been corrected and finished copies would now be distributed'.

But Stuart Jury, of County Town Butchers, who was sent a hard copy of the draft booklet, said he had not yet paid the £350 charge to advertise in the guide because of the 'glaring mistake'.

The blunder was labelled 'ludicrous' by Ross Cumber, manager of Taste restaurant in Dorchester.

'For a town so rich in natural beauty and historical landmarks, I can't believe it happened in the first place' he said.

The original booklet featured a picture on the front page of Weymouth (file picture). The blunder has been branded 'ludicrous' by traders in Dorchester

Andrew Wadsworth, director of the Brewery Square development in the town, said 'Dorchester's streets appear to be flooded.

'They've got to be kidding - what a joke.'

The publisher said the corrected booklet would be distributed to more than 10,000 residential and business addresses from February 16th.

Dorset County Council, West Dorset District Council and Dorchester Town Council said they did not have links with the firm.
