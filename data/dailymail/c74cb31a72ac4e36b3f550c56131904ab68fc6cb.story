A thieving 'Spider-Man' was arrested after residents spotted a figure dressed in black perched between railings on the side of a building.

Residents in a community in southwest China's Guizhou Province observed a man dressed in black climbing on the wall of a residential building on Sunday night.

The man, wearing a face mask, was clinging to the metal brackets of windows on the fourth and fifth floor on the outside wall when he was discovered.

The man was caught in the act as he navigated his way down the side of the building in China

Shocked residents managed to phone the police who arrived just in the nick of time to arrest him

The burglar was dubbed 'Spider-Man' by witnesses. 

'We were about to sleep when we heard someone calling "stop thief," said one woman.

'Then we came downstairs to see what happened.' 

Similar to Spider-Man, the burglar wore a mask, but it was all in vain as he was arrested at the scene

The man spent an hour on the side of the building before police persuaded him to come down

The man, who was suspected of stealing items with accomplices, was taken to a police station 

The man had suspended himself on the wall for over one hour after being noticed by others. 

Police persuaded the man to come down before they captured him.

The 20-year-old man was suspected of stealing items with his accomplices.
