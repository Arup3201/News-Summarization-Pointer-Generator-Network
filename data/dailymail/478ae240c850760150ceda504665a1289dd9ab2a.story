As a Formula 1 driver, Jenson Button travels the world - but when it comes to putting his feet up; he reveals Hawaii is his favourite destination.

Button, who won the World Drivers Championship in 2009,  says the paradise isle is the perfect place to relax with fantastic food and sunshine-guaranteed weather after competing in a massive 19 races a year. 

When he's not jet-setting across the globe, the 34-year-old Somerset-born McLaren racer lives in Monaco with his fiancee Jessica Michibata.

Here, the racing driver, who has teamed up with Hilton Hotels, talks to MailOnline about his most memorable holiday and recalls his most embarrassing travel scenario. 

Keen traveller: When he's not trotting the globe Jenson Button likes to kick back in Hawaii

What are your travel plans for 2014?

I have 19 races in 2014, many of them in countries I may never go to if it was not for Formula 1 and this takes up most of my year! I do have a couple of personal holidays planned but no destinations confirmed as of yet.

What’s been your most memorable holiday?

I like spending time in Hawaii and go there often between Formula 1 seasons. I also like training holidays and spending time up in the mountains.

For a two-week holiday, where's your favourite destination and why? 

I really like being in Hawaii, because it allows me to train, whilst also enjoying the weather, the great beaches and fantastic food.

What’s the best hotel you’ve stayed in and why? 

My favourite Grand Prix hotel is the Conrad Centennial in Singapore. We spend so much time in hotels throughout the year, but this one really stands out and the team there go above and beyond to make sure we feel at home. 

Singapore is a unique place for us as we stay on European time to cope with the long hours we work due to it being a night race, so for the team, the hotel also switches to European time, meaning they serve us breakfast at 2pm, then dinner when we get back from work at 6am! 

They keep the gym open 24hrs for us, have switched the maid service to the evening so as not to disturb us when we sleep during the day and have actually installed blackout blinds on the floors that we stay on so that we can sleep during the day.

What’s been your most extravagant travel-related purchase? 

Probably when I fly privately, although I don’t do that very often. It’s mostly for races and allows me to get there and back a lot easier

Which country would you happily go back to time and again – and why? 

America because it has everything. I love California, but also big cities like New York, Hawaii...it’s all very different.

London rules: Jenson Button says the British capital is the best place in the world for a city break

What’s your favourite restaurant in the UK and why?

My favourite restaurant is a Japanese restaurant in London called Umu which does fantastic Japanese food. I also really like Maggie Jones which does great traditional English food.

Where's the best place in the world for a city break and why? 

I really love London. It’s probably the city I know the most although I don’t get to spend much time there anymore, as I live in Monaco and when I am in the UK it is mostly for training at the McLaren Technology Centre. 

If I was going to travel to a city, it would definitely be Tokyo. I love the food and the culture and it’s a very chilled city, very diverse, but they still have their traditions which is great.

Tell us an embarrassing travel scenario you’ve found yourself in…

I was once in the lounge at Heathrow waiting to fly, and someone mistook me for Chris Martin from Coldplay. 

An American family came up and told me they’d been big fans for years, so I signed a few autographs for them before they then told me they had all my albums! When I told them who I really was, they said they were still big fans...although I actually don’t think they knew who I was!

If you could pick anyone (not family or friends) famous to travel with, who would it be and why? 

If I had to pick someone it would be Audrey Hepburn, because my fianceé is a big fan and I know she would like it! 

Although I’m really not that sort of person and would not want to go on holiday with someone just because they were famous. I would much rather spend time with friends and family who I know I would have a great time with.

Who’s the most interesting person you’ve met on your travels and why? 

My friends and family are the most interesting people I travel with, because I love spending time with them and they are the people who know me best so we always have a great time together, whether travelling for work or pleasure.

What’s your top travel tip? 

If you can manage it, just travel with hand luggage. It makes it so much easier when you get to your destination and don’t have to wait for your luggage!
