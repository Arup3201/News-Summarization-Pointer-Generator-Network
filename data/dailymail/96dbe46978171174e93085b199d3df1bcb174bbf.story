Commonwealth Games shooting gold medallist Nur Ayuni Farhana Abdul Halim has been left devastated after being ruled out of competing in Glasgow because her competition jacket was lost en route to Scotland.

Malaysian Ayuni, who won the gold medal with Nur Suryani Taibi in the 10 metre air rifle pairs in New Delhi four years ago, was due to compete in the 10 metre air rifle and 50m rifle prone events.

Team manager Musa Omar said he was left with no choice but to withdraw Ayuni from competition after the missing luggage, believed to be in London, failed to show in time for Monday’s registration ahead of Thursday’s start of competition.

Aim: Ayuni was devastated after being forced to quit the competition in Glasgow after losing her jacket

The jacket of a shooter is there to aid in holding the rifle, ensuring the best accuracy, and to protect.

There are strict rules in shooting when it comes to the proper equipment, as there would be in any major sport.

There are rules regarding the jacket, trousers, and even 'undergarments'.

But what do the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) say?

'The ISSF establishes specific standards for competition clothing and equipment that athletes may use in ISSF Championships and for Equipment Control testing to check those standards in order to safeguard the principles of equal and ethical competition.

'Athletes must use only equipment and apparel that complies with ISSF Rules. Athletes are responsible for ensuring that all items of equipment and clothing used (complies) with ISSF Rules.'

'She was a gold medallist last time and now she won’t even get a chance to compete. It is really painful for her. I just feel so sorry for her,' Musa was quoted as saying by Malaysian media on Tuesday.

'We made a report when her bag did not arrive with the other luggage. We waited for three days... (Tuesday) is the last day for us to confirm the names.

'The rules clearly state that a rifle shooter must wear a jacket.

'We tried to borrow one but it did not fit her. We tried to make a new one but she said that she would need two months to get used to it.'

Musa said Ayuni had been unable to stop crying and wanted to fly home immediately upon being told she would not be able to compete.

However, Musa said she would have to stay with the team in Scotland and watch Muslifah Zulkifli take her place in the 10m air rifle and Suryani, who competed in the 2012 London Olympics while 30 weeks pregnant, take over for the 50m prone.

'The licence for all her firearms is under her name. We cannot send her back immediately,' Musa said.

'This is all so unfortunate. She’s taking it badly. She is sad, we are all sad.'
