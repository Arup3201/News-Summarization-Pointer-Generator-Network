Arie Eddy, 18, has been struggling to find a job for almost three years and only managed to secure one job interview during that time

As youth unemployment continues to rise across Australia, more and more young people are struggling to find work.

In Victoria the number of individuals under the age of 24 without work has hit a 15-year high, while in Queensland unemployment is also on the rise according to the ABS.

Arie Eddy, from Warrnambool on the south-west coast of Victoria - about 260 kilometres from Melbourne, has been searching unsuccessfully for work for almost three years.

'It constantly makes me feel worthless. It makes me feel like I don't have any purpose and every day is hard to get through. I feel like I have no need to be around if I haven't got a job,' Arie told The Age.

After leaving school in Hamilton at 16 to move south in search of a new life, the 18-year-old joined the military. However four months in he was forced out because he suffers from severe asthma.

Victorian Council of Social Service chief executive Emma King told the publication the situation is also dire for graduates.

'They are continually told they don't have enough experience. We have a very competitive job market, they have done all the right things in terms of education,' she said.

Over the past few years Arie estimated he'd applied for more than 780 jobs, but only secured one interview and remains unemployed.

Youth unemployment rates are on the rise in many states, with the worst hit being Tasmania, followed by QLD

As a requirement of his youth allowance from Centrelink Arie must apply for 20 jobs each fornight, but so far it has been to no avail for the young Victorian.

The Age report he receives $545 per fortnight from the government, but that is barely enough to survive once rent, bills, food, petrol amd asthma and depression medication are all taken care of.

Arie said at least 30 of his friends are also struggling to find work, and his family in Hamilton are suffering financially too.

While on youth allowance the government requires its recipients to apply for at least 20 jobs each fortnight

Now, after the hospitality course he was taking part in at TAFE was scrapped when funding was cut, he is considering following in his family's footsteps and getting into security.

Arie's grandmother and aunts work in the industry and in six months time he will begin studying a Certificate II in security thanks to a course his employment agency has organised.

With 95 percent of the cost taken care of, Arie is positive about the experience and hopes it will help turn his luck around and finally secure him a job.

Despite Victoria's youth unemployment rates being at their highest in more than a decade, Tasmania is classified as the worst state for young people to find jobs. Queensland follows not too far behind.
