The owner of a Maine Christmas tree farm said customers were taking advantage of his business' honor system by stealing trees and wreaths.

Todd Murphy, of Trees to Please in Norridgewock, Maine, said about $2,000 worth of merchandise has been stolen this season, including about a dozen trees worth $400 over the weekend.

The Christmas tree farm said that they will be forced to raise prices if people continue to steal trees 

Mr Murphy told the Kennebec Journal that hundreds of people visit the farm each weekend in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and sometimes they don't pay.

He said: 'I’m just getting tired of it, and that’s why I called the police today, just to have an officer come over.' 

If people continue to steal, he said that he will have no option but to raise prices.

He has notified police about the latest theft. 

Mr Murphy said that his business had been hit hard because it is seasonal and only open four weeks in the year. 

The 26-acre farm in Maine sells 'cut-your-own' trees as well as ones which are cut down by the staff along with ornaments and wreaths.
