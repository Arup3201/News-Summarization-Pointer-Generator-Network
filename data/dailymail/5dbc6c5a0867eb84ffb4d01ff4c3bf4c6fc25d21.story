The best friend of an 11-year-old boy who died when the dirt tunnel they were digging collapsed has described his desperate attempt to save him.

Anthony Fowler, from Temecula, California, was crushed by two feet of dirt and rocks while making a tunnel at a park with Tyler Brown, also 11.

The youngster screamed to his best friend that he could not breathe. Unable to dig him out, Tyler called 911 but Anthony later died in hospital.

Tragic: 11-year-old Anthony Fowler, pictured, has died after he was crushed by dirt as he dug a tunnel along a dry riverbed with his best friend

'I just tried to dig him out and dirt kept falling in so I called 911 and told them my location,' Tyler recounted to CBS Los Angeles.

The boys had been digging tunnels into the side of the dry riverbed at Long Canyon Creek Park on Saturday when one of the tunnels collapsed.

Tyler had been sitting up at the time, but Anthony was lying down. After the soil fell in, Tyler could only see Anthony's shoe.

Two passers-by rushed over and managed to dig the boy out after hearing Tyler's screams.

When emergency services pulled the 
boy from the soil and administered CPR, he spat out some dirt and then 
stopped breathing, Tyler told CBS.

Tyler
visited Anthony several times in the San Diego hospital where the 
youngster was in an induced coma and had no brain function.

Happy memories: The boys had been friends for four years and lived just one street from each other. They enjoyed riding their bikes and digging at the park

Anthony passed away on Monday, his parents announced on Thursday. They added that the boy's organs had been donated to others.

The two boys lived just one street away from each other and had been playing together for four years, the Temecula Patch reported.

'They'd get on their bikes, ride around and have adventures, like boys should,' Tyler's father Chris Brown told the paper.

Tyler,
who escaped with scratches, has been branded a 'hero' by his classmates
- but the youngster refuses to accept the accolade.

'I wouldn't say that because usually heroes save lives and I couldn't get [Anthony] out fast enough,' he told CBS.

Panic: Two passers-by helped Tyler pull his friend from the dirt and called 911. Anthony was taken to hospital and put in a coma, but died two days later

He added: 'We’re almost like brothers because we’re always helping each other out and we’re usually at each others’ houses everyday.'

Tyler is now seeing a therapist to cope with losing his best friend.

On their CaringBridge.org page, Anthony Fowler's parents shared their decision to donate the boy's organs to others.

They wrote: 'Early this morning at 4:56 am, his heart stopped and Anthony made the ultimate sacrifice to give so many others a chance to live.

'Today as with every other day, he is our hero. As his parents we are sad but at the same time very proud that our son has given the gift of life to others.'
