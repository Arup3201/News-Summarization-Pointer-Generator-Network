Fenerbahce defeated rivals Galatasaray on penalties to win the 2014 Turkish Super Cup in a game which was filled with drama.

The most notable piece of action - away from both sets of supporters throwing bottles and flares onto the pitch - came during a penalty shoot-out between the two Istanbul-based rivals.

Brazilian midfielder Felipe Melo stepped up to the plate to take a penalty but blazed the ball high over the bar.

Controversy: Graeme Souness, who managed Galatasaray in the 95-96 season, decided to plant his side's flag in the middle of Fenerbahce's pitch

Games between Turkish giants Fenerbahce and Galatasaray are extremely competitive due to their domestic success and the fact that they are both based in Istanbul.

Both sides have a strong fanbase who are extremely passionate about all things connected with their respective teams.

The rivalry stretches beyond football as both sides compete in other sports such as basketball, volleyball and rowing.

Fenerbahce and Galatasaray came close to joining forces in 1912 however the idea did not come to fruition due to the Balkan Wars.

Former Premier League manager Graeme Souness was involved in a high-profile incident between the two sides when the then Galatasaray manager decided to plant his side's flag in the middle of Fenerbahce's pitch after winning the Turkish Cup final - leaving the home fans furious.

To make matters worse for Melo, Fenerbahce goalkeeper Volkan Demirel decided to jump on the back of the 31-year-old midfielder to spark a brief confrontation between both sets of players.

Melo, who was close to joining Arsenal in July 2010, was far from happy with Demirel's antics and the pair had to be separated by the referee.

The Brazilian may have been targeted by Demirel as Melo was pictured laughing hysterically when Fenerbahce midfielder Emre was sent off in a fixture between the two sides at the Turk Telekom Arena at the back end of last season.

Demirel's side went onto lift the Turkish Super Cup 3-2 on penalties to the delight of the Fenerbahce fans.
