A primary school teacher who was sacked after she was spotted taking cocaine by a parent died after injecting herself with a horse tranquiliser.

Lian Watson had been working as a veterinary nurse and had started using ketamine, which is also used as a horse tranquiliser, since losing her job as a teacher.

Miss Watson was sacked from St Patrick’s Catholic Primary School in Heysham, Lancashire, after admitting that she had used cocaine on a number of occasions, including in a nightclub in front of an off duty police officer and a parent of a child in her class.

The night before her death, Miss Watson, pictured, hosted a dinner party for her friend and colleague Miss Klecandova and two other friends, where one guest described her as being in 'good spirits'

An inquest 
into her death heard she died in February after injecting herself with 
ketamine and other drugs used to put down horses, which she had stolen 
from her friend and colleague who is a vet.

Miss Watson, 30, took them from the boot of her friend’s car following a dinner party at her home in Scotforth, Lancashire.

The
 inquest, held at Lancaster Magistrates Court, heard that Miss Watson 
had been using ketamine before her death.

Four months before she died 
she enrolled herself into a drug treatment programme led by a group 
called Inspire but discharged herself shortly afterwards.

The inquest
 heard that Miss Watson, who was an accomplished horse rider and 
well-known on the county's equestrian scene, was said to have often 
assisted vet Olga Klecandova with visits.

It
 was told that it would be part of her role as an equestrian nurse to 
stock up Miss Klecandova’s car dubbed a 'mobile hospital' with the 
various drugs.

The
 night before her death, Miss Watson hosted a dinner party for Miss 
Klecandova and two other friends, where one guest, Colm Earle, described
 her as being in 'good spirits'. Miss Klevandova said her friend 'was 
always very happy'.

But Mr Earle said that after the dinner and when everyone had gone to
 bed at around 11pm he noticed Miss Watson acting 'suspicious', before she went out to Miss Klecandova's car.

He said he had initially thought she was stepping out of the house to drive somewhere and warned her against it.

He
 added: 'She muttered something to me and went out into the yard to the 
back of Olga’s jeep.

'She
 was rummaging in the back of the jeep. I didn’t know what she was 
doing. I asked her if she was okay, I didn’t quite hear what she said, I
 left her to it.'

Mr Earle added that as he went to brush his teeth he noticed the 
downstairs light on and saw Miss Watson lying on the floor in the 
hallway. He said she had blood on her hand but had thought she had fallen and had cut herself.

Miss Watson was found dead the following morning and was said to have multiple needle marks on her left forearm, hand, wrist and mid elbow as well as marks to her upper chest and under her breast, that had 'looked very fresh'.

Pathologist Dr M. Al-Mudhaffer said that her cause of death had been respiratory depression due to combined drug use.

Coroner Simon Jones said that the drugs would produce a central nervous system depression that would reduce breathing.

Coroner Simon Jones said that someone who works with horses and cows 'may be expected to be aware of the consequences' of taking powerful drugs like ketamine

Toxicology tests revealed that ketamine was found in her blood as well 
as a heart blocker drug and the sedative anaesthetic, which is 
used to euthanise animals.

Miss Klecandova told the inquest that her car, a Kia Sports Hatchback was like a mobile 'hospital', adding that Miss Watson would have known what medication was in the boot of her car.

She added: 'She would help me, pass me the drugs. It was her job.'

Police were called to the scene the morning of her death but ruled out any suspicious or third party involvement.

Coroner Simon Jones returned a verdict of misadventure, adding that he believe she had taken an 'opportunity' to take the drugs.

He said: 'What she did on this occasion she did on her own, no one else was involved, there are no suspicious circumstances.

He added that one of the drugs, 'is used to put down large animals, horses and cows and so on the face of it someone who works in that field may be expected to be aware of the consequences of taking a dose of that.

'However I also have to bear in mind no note was left. I have the very clear evidence of her behaviour the night before from three friends describing her as being in good spirits.

'I believe against a background of past ketamine use, she has seen an opportunity, her friend and colleague’s parked car and the left substances in the boot. A likely explanation is she has taken the opportunity to appropriate drugs from the car.'

Following 
her death, a statement from international horse charity World Horse Welfare said that they were 
'saddened' to learn of Lian's death and that they offered their 'sincerest
 condolences to her family and friends'.

They
 added that they would like to thank Miss Watson's family and friends 
for their kind and generous donations, which they made in Miss Watson's honour 
following her death.

In 2011 Miss Watson had her case brought before the General Teaching Council after she was seen by a parent taking cocaine.

She was sacked from her role as a teacher at St Patrick’s Catholic Primary School in Heysham, near Morecambe, Lancashire after admitting taking the Class A drug twice in 2006.

At the time, the General Teaching Council chairman described Miss Watson as a 'competent teacher' and said that she 'demonstrated a passion for teaching'.

The council found her behaviour was 
‘unacceptable professional conduct’ and issued a reprimand - the lowest 
punishment available to them - allowing her to return to the profession 
if she wished.

The chairman added that she had 'a future contribution to make to the teaching profession'.

However she never returned to teaching and changed careers becoming a veterinary nurse.

Miss Watson was known for her horsemanship, competing in numerous dressage competitions and being listed on the British Eventing website.

In 2008 she came third in the Working Hunter Pony jumping category at the Horse of the Year show with her horse, Meath Busy Body.
