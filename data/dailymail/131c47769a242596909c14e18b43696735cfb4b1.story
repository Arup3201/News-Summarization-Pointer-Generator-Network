Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin clashed  head-on yesterday over the crisis in Ukraine.

The US president said his Russian counterpart was ‘not fooling anybody’ when he denied sending his troops into the Crimea.

Despite clear evidence they were Russian, Mr Putin claims soldiers seen in the peninsula are ‘local forces of self defence’.

He said he was not planning on war but 
would use ‘all measures’ to protect citizens following an 
‘unconstitutional coup’ in Kiev.

Putin, left, claims soldiers seen in the peninsula are 'local forces of self defence' while the US president said his Russian counterpart was 'not fooling anybody' by denying they were Russian troops

Speaking for the first time since Russian troops effectively took control of the Crimean peninsula, Putin said if 'anarchy' erupts elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Moscow would have no hesitation in responding

Ousted president Viktor Yanukovych had appealed for help to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine, he added.

Mr Obama ridiculed the claims and insisted Moscow had violated international law.

‘President Putin seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations – but I don’t think that’s fooling anybody,’ he said.

His secretary of state John Kerry also condemned Russia’s ‘aggression’. On another day of drama:

Looking relaxed in front of reporters, Mr Putin spoke shortly after ordering thousands of Russian troops on an exercise near the Ukrainian border to return to barracks.

Vladimir Putin also cautioned the international community about the potential consequences of any sanctions - saying 'in our modern world everybody depends on everybody'

He cautioned the international community about the potential consequences of any sanctions, saying: ‘In our modern world, everybody depends on everybody. It is possible to harm each other but it will be a mutual harm.’

There were more reports yesterday of Ukrainian troops in Crimea defecting to Russia and Mr Putin said: ‘Ukraine is not only our closest neighbour but it is our fraternal republic, our fraternal neighbour and our armed forces are brothers in arms, friends.

‘They know each other personally and I am sure that Ukrainian military and Russian military are not going to be on different sides of the barricades, they are going to be on the same side.

‘There can be only one assessment of what happened in Kiev, in Ukraine in general. This was an anti-constitutional coup and the armed seizure of power.

‘If people ask us for help –because we already have an appeal from the legitimate president of Ukraine – we reserve the right to use all the measures to protect those citizens. This is completely legitimate.’

An estimated 16,000 Russian troops are in Crimea but Mr Putin insisted the soldiers in uniforms without insignia who seized key locations were not Russian troops but local self-defence forces.

Mr Obama insisted Moscow had violated international law at a conference to discuss Ukraine

‘We don’t want to enslave anybody, we don’t want to dictate anything to anybody but we cannot stand aside when somebody will be annihilating and using torture,’ added the Russian president.

‘We are not going to meddle. But we think all Ukraine’s citizens, no matter where they live, should have the same rights to ... determine the future of their country.’

Mr Putin claimed the snipers who claimed up to 20 lives in  Kiev could have been planted by protest groups, who he branded ‘semi-fascists’.

He said Mr Yanukovych, now facing a ‘mass murder’ probe in his homeland, personally assured him he had not ordered his security services to shoot at unarmed demonstrators.

Ukraine’s acting interior minister Arsen Avakov did not say where the suspected killers were from. But it was previously claimed a senior ex-Russian security services chief was staying in a plush hotel advising the government on cracking down on demonstrators.

John Kerry also condemned Russia¿s ¿aggression¿ today while visiting the country. Mr Kerry announced a $1billion economic package for Kiev

In a clear sign of advanced planning – even during the last days of the Sochi Winter Olympics – private security forces were lined up by Moscow to be deployed to Crimea on the quiet.

Hundreds of members of Vnevedomstvenaya Okhrana, Russia’s quasi-private interior ministry security force – many of them former soldiers – were deployed to protect Russian Navy installations and assets in Crimea.

The private security guards were armed with AK-47 assault rifles and PKM machine guns and wore plain uniforms without any insignia. Regular troops were flown in, equipped with more modern weapons and carrying light anti-tank weapons.

Signs that Mr Putin is backpedalling helped the financial markets, which clawed back a large chunk of Monday’s losses.

Russia’s RTS shares index, which slumped 12 per cent on Monday rose 6.2 per cent yesterday. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average was up by 1.4 per cent. 

‘Confidence in equity markets has been restored,’ said David Madden, market analyst at IG.

Meanwhile NATO and Russia have agreed to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine at a special meeting tomorrow.

The alliance announced that an extraordinary NATO-Russia council will convene at the suggestion of secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

Russia agreed to the meeting today, when NATO ambassadors were discussing the crisis among themselves.

Rasmussen has previously said Russia's military intervention in Ukraine is in violation of the U.N. charter and threatens peace and security in Europe.

The announcement came after Russian troops in control of the Belbek air base in Crimea fired warning shots into the air as around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back.

About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned the Ukrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach.

They fired several warning shots into the air and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to advance.

The Ukrainian forces are believed to be led by Colonel Yuli Mamchor, commander of the Ukrainian military garrison at Belbek, who was seen speaking to gun-wielding Russian troops at the air base.

Ukraine's new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will meet EU leaders on Thursday ahead of an emergency summit the same day on the crisis in his country, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said.

EU leaders 'will discuss situation in Ukraine with PM Yatsenyuk in Brussels Thursday prior to extraordinary summit,' Van Rompuy said on Twitter this morning.

Earlier in the day, two Russian warships on their way to Crimea passed through Istanbul's Bosphorus straits.

The Saratov and Yamal warships, which are usually based in the Mediterranean, were seen sailing unaccompanied through the Marmara Sea before entering the straits at around 7.30am local time.

At the same time as the Russian warships headed towards the Crimea, a Ukrainian ship called 'Hetman Sahaidachny entered the straits at Canakkale in Turkey.

The head of Ukraine's security service also this morning suggested the country has come under a number of cyber attacks from illegal telecommunications equipment installed in Crimea since Russian troops moved into the region.

Valentyn Nalivaichenko said the mobile phones of lawmakers had been hit by the cyber attacks.

The Kremlin, which does not recognise the new Ukrainian leadership, insists it made the move to protect millions of Russians living in the region, with Moscow's UN envoy adding that ousted president Viktor Yanukovych had asked the country to send troops across the border.

Ukraine has effectively lost control of the Crimean peninsula and admits it has ‘no military options’ to make Moscow withdraw.
