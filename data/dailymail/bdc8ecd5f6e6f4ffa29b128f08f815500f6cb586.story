Tignous, 57, had been working as a cartoonist since the 1980s and was a member of a group of artists called Cartoonists for Peace.

He also belonged to the Association de la Presse Judiciaire, an association of French journalists covering the courts, and sent his last drawing - a self-portrait wishing Happy New Year - to the association the night before his death.

A private family funeral was also held for Georges Wolinski, 80, another of Charlie Hebdo's veteran cartoonists. 

His works had appeared in weekly magazine Paris Match, satirical magazine Hara-Kiri - considered a forerunner of Charlie Hebdo - and numerous other publications. 

A large crowd had also gathered for the funeral of Franck Brinsolaro, the police officer who served on the bodyguard detail for the murdered editor of Charlie Hebdo, Stephane 'Charb' Charbonnier.

Defender: The coffin of Franck Brinsolaro, the police officer charged with protecting late Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier, is carried out of the Sainte-Croix Church during his funeral

Policemen broke into applause as the coffin of Mr Brinsolaro was carried into a church in the town of Bernay this morning.

The funeral of psychoanalyst and Charlie Hebdo columnist Elsa Cayat is also set to be held today

The ceremonies follow reports that the three terrorists responsible for last week's attacks could be laid to rest near where they carried out their atrocities, as their hometowns are unwilling to bury them.

Mayors are afraid the graves of Said and Cherif Kouachi, behind the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, and Amedy Coulibaly, shot dead after a siege at a Jewish deli in Paris, could become shrines for Islamic extremists.

Under French law, the burials must take place either in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed.

The Kouachi brothers were shot dead by the police as they charged out of a printworks in Dammartin-en-Goele, north east of Paris, meaning they could be buried nearby.

Their father died when they were young and they were taken into care, meaning they have no immediate family who wish to organise a possible funeral and burial elsewhere.
