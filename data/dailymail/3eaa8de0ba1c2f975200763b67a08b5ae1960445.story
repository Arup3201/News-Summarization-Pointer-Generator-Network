David Seaman believes Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere should be included in Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 European Championship squad this summer.

The 23-year-old has been part of the England senior set up for the last five years, but the midfielder has suffered with injuries and has missed large parts of Arsenal's season.

Wilshere is closing in on full fitness again and Seaman believes his inclusion in the squad would be a benefit to everyone.

Seaman, who made 75 appearances for the Three Lions, told talkSPORT: 'I'd like to see him go (to the European Championship).

'He has not played a lot of football this season and, if he is fit, he should go.'

The former Gunner also believes Southgate should be allowed to take the best possible team available to him.

Liverpool ace Raheem Sterling, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley and Manchester United left back Luke Shaw are all eligible to play for the U21 side.

And the goalkeeper believes all three should travel if chosen by Southgate, despite the fact those eligible players now consider themselves part of Roy Hodgson's senior squad.
