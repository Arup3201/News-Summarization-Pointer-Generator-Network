Bar Refaeli recently split with her boyfriend Adi Ezra in a blazing row over Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger - ruining her 29th birthday.

And now the Israeli supermodel's latest campaign might just rub salt into the wounds.

The 29-year-old showcases her healthy figure in the new Passionata AW14 campaign and poses in a series of saucy images alongside a mysterious man.

Look away now, Ezra! Bar Refaeli flirts with a mysterious male model in her new Passionata lingerie campaign, after her boyfriend reportedly ended things with her

The theme for the season is 'Let's Play' and Bar definitely looks like she's in a playful mood as she flirts with the male model and can be seen seducing him while he's blindfolded.

The Let's Play range features three different bra shapes and a night dress all available in black, dark purple, lipstick pink and neon yellow and modelled to perfection by Bar.

World famous curves: Bar was the cover model of the 2009 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and topped Maxim magazine's Hot 100 list of 2012

As well as showing off her enviable body in her new campaign, Bar was also seen flaunting it on the beach last week.

The swimwear and lingerie model opted for a green two-piece for the trip to the sea, and 
showed it off in a series of pictures posted to her Instagram account.

She adapted the lyrics from Coldplay’s Yellow for a caption on one of the snaps, writing: ‘Look at the sun, look how it shines for you.’

A woman of many talents: Bar has starred in plenty of glossy fashion campaigns and as of 2013, she has been the host of the first season of The X Factor Israel

In the other picture, Bar wrote: ‘Enjoy the simple things #sunset at the #beach’.

Refaeli
 has previously stated that her favourite place to be is by the sea, so 
it’s no surprise to see her gallivanting across the sand once more.

No
 doubt her holiday break was a welcome distraction after her split with Adi Ezra.

Bar admitted she was serious about Ezra and the couple were pictured on an intimate vacation in Thailand in March.

However,
 Israeli publications reported the couple split after Ezra accused the 
blonde of dancing too close to notorious womaniser Mick Jagger, 70, with one 
claiming that he was so furious he grabbed Bar and pulled her off the 
dance floor at an exclusive Stones party.

The couple were then heard having an argument and left the bash separately - and have not spoken since.

Bar
 - who was pictured partying with Jagger last year - and Ezra attended 
the Stones gig at Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv last month, celebrating the 
model's birthday.
