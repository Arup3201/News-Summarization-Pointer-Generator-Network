Training ground brawls can happen from time to time as tempers flare - but it is rare for a fight to break out twice during one session as it did between the Dallas Cowboys and Oakland Raiders.

The two NFL teams held an open training session in California on Tuesday and, after a Raiders fan allegedly smashed Dallas cornerback BW Webb twice on the back of the head, an almighty brawl arose.

Dallas' defence and Oakland's offence began exchanging punches and Raiders' Mychal Rivera was thrown to the ground by Cowboy's cornerback Mo Claiborne, according to ESPN's Tim MacMahon.

Incredibly, a second right broke out between the same groups again after the last play of the session.

A Dallas back-up reserve had his helmet torn off his head and this led to another brawl in the centre of the pitch.

The Dallas Cowboys tweeted a photo of one of the brawls with the caption: 'Hey @ufc, some of these guts may have a future with you.'
