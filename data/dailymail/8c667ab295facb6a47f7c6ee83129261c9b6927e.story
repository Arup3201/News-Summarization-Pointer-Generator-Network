NASA is set to admit that an astronaut who nearly drowned in space had water leak into his space suit twice last year.

Luca Parmitano’s pressurized helmet began to fill with water, covering his eyes, ears and nose, while he was carrying out a space walk at the International Space Station in July.

Blinded by the water, Italian Parmitano relied on his memory to get him back to the airlock cabin and had to be pulled back inside the space station by his fellow astronauts.

At the time of Parmitano’s near drowning, Flight Directors said they were surprised by the July 16 incident.

However,
 Parmitano’s spacesuit had already had a leak a week before, on July 9, a
 fact which will be brought up in today’s report, according to ABC News.

Mr
 Parmitano was at the beginning of a six-and-a-half hour spacewalk with 
U.S. colleague Chris Cassidy when cooling water began streaming from the
 air vent in his space suit and into his helmet.

'It was like walking around with your eyes closed in a fishbowl,' Parmitano said in a NASA video describing the malfunction.

Ooops: More than seven months later, NASA is set to admit that Parmitano's space suit had suffered a leak the week before, on July 9

'It's just a very uncomfortable feeling to be with your face under water for all that time.'

'I was just lucky to be back inside in no time.'

The
 suits worn by astronauts when outside pressurized cabins are known as 
EVAs, Extra-Vehicular Activity suits and were designed 35 years ago.

Astronauts
 wear a liquid-cooled garment under the suit which serves to regulate 
body temperature.

It was the cooling water used in this under-suit that 
experts suspect began to leak into Parmitano's helmet.

'The
 water - if it had continued to leak much more, it would have been very 
serious,' Chris Cassidy said a separate NASA video released Tuesday.

Cassidy
 explained that the cooling water somehow got into Parmitano's 
ventilation system. The helmet of the suit has an air vent that blows 
oxygen from behind the astronaut's head.

Water
 bubbles built up then began leaking water from behind Parmitano's head 
into the helmet, saturating his communication cap and filling up to 
cover his nose, mouth and ears.

'Once
 the water got big enough that it went all the way around and started 
coming outside the edge of the white plastic piece, then it saturated 
his communication cap, and sort of capillary flow just brought the water
 all around his head,' Cassidy explained.

'He had water filled up in his ear cups, and it started to creep into his eyes and covered his nose.'

An
 investigation was carried out by NASA engineers in Houston, however 
only the second incident involving Parmitano’s spacesuit was reported.
