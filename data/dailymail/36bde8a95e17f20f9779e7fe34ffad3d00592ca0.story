The BBC and ITV face a fresh wave of anger over their World Cup coverage, after viewers attacked pundits for struggling to speak and understand English during broadcasts.

Former Brazil midfielder Juninho and Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro were singled out for presenting styles which bordered on the incomprehensible, and for a failure to understand their co-presenters' analysis.

The fury comes after the BBC received 445 complaints over Phil Neville's 'boring' commentary style during Saturday night's match between England and Italy, which averaged 14.4 million viewers.

The social media response to an earlier appearance by Fabio Cannavaro wasn't much more positive

Both the BBC and ITV have come under attack for employing presenters with an apparently limited grasp of the English language, with Juninho, 41, and Cannavaro, 40, taking much of the blame.

During the BBC's coverage of last night's match between Argentina and Bosnia, one Twitter user wrote: 'I'm sorry but why is Juninho on the panel? His English just isn't up to scratch.'

During an earlier appearance by Cannavaro, another user said: 'They should provide English speaking courses and tests for the pundits before allowing them on ITV or even BBC. Cannavaro is struggling.'

'Incredible defender, but Cannavaro sounds like he's put 'conversational English' on his CV and ITV took him at his word,' another added.

The complaints emerged just hours after the BBC's lead match commentator Jonathan Pearce was ridiculed for a farcical display during yesterday's match between France and Honduras.

The BBC has received hundreds of complaints about former England player Phil Neville's commentary

Failing to understand the way goal-line technology was being used during the tournament, Pearce's commentary descended into chaos when he appeared confused by a computer animation that first showed 'no goal' when the football hit the post, before changing to 'goal' when it crossed the line.

It wasn't until co-presenter Martin Keown pointed out the final decision to award a goal that Pearce realised what was going on, setting him off on a rant about the quality of the technology.

The bizarre exchange saw well-known figures users mock the veteran commentator on Twitter.

Screenwriter Dave Turner said: 'Jonathan Pearce apparently confused by the concept of events happening in linear time.'

Comedian
 Dara Oâ€™Brien added: 'Not sure who that commentator is but somebody 
should explain the goal-line technology to him and calm him down.'

The complaints over BBC commentators and pundits raises wider concerns about the broadcaster's coverage of the World Cup.

Questions are now being asked over who will be involved in coverage of England matches should the team progress beyond the group stage.

Following his shambolic display, the BBC insisted that Pearce remained a 'important, well respected' member of its team.

But The Telegraph quoted a spokesperson as saying: 'Everything for the final 16 [round of the tournament] will be decided much closer to the time.'
