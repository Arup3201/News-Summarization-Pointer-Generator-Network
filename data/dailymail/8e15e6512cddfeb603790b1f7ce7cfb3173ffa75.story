I'm very glad and grateful to be the No 1 seed at Wimbledon this year. I always try to perform at my best here.

It was the tournament I always dreamed of winning and in 2011 my dream came true: I won Wimbledon and became No1 in the world in just a matter of days. Hopefully I can go for a second title this year.

The highlight of my career is that 2011 Wimbledon final. I went back home and celebrated with my people and I will never forget it. They are memories that will be ingrained in my heart forever.

Leading the pack: Novak Djokovic, last year's runner-up, will return to Wimbledon as the top seed

After the French Open I went to Ibiza, took five or six days of complete rest and spent some time with my friends and family as I tried to recover from a difficult emotional loss in the final against Rafael Nadal. That’s sport, though. It’s not the first match I’ve lost in my career so I got over it and now I’m ready to focus on Wimbledon.

Some players like to take part in tournaments to adjust to the transition from clay to grass but I didn’t plan to play any tournaments on grass courts prior to Wimbledon. Then, because of the fact I spent so much energy - both physical and mental - at Roland Garros, I just felt like I needed more time to rest and recharge my batteries.

I’ve spent the last week in London, practising on the grass to get ready for the most prestigious tournament in our sport. I love this city because of the access to nature and the great parks.

Wimbledon Common and Richmond Park are walking distance from the house we rent for The Championships and suddenly you’re there, seeing nature. I even saw deer the other day. I couldn’t believe it: a wild safari and yet so close to town.

London’s a very international city and the more I come back, the more I like it. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll live here!

I drive a sports car right now but I think I’m going to have to give it up in a couple of months because I’m going to become a father. My days of driving two-seater cars are over although I rarely get to drive it because I’m travelling all the time.

Between matches at Wimbledon I eat a lot of carbohydrates: pasta, rice, potatoes and vegetables and maybe some kind of protein, like fish, chicken or turkey. It’s nothing spectacular. I just keep it simple to avoid any problems with digestion.

I like being in the kitchen, but I like to be the consumer rather than the cook. My parents still have a restaurant in the mountains back in Serbia, which the family has had for 20 years. We serve mainly Italian food and I spent a lot of time in the restaurant so I know how to prepare the most basic things, but if I see there is somebody who has more expertise then I leave it to them.

The beauty of Wimbledon is you have so many houses around the All England Club for the players to use. I’m staying in a house with my fiancee Jelena and the rest of my team. We have a chef and fresh, organic food every day, which is great. I’ve stayed in the same house for the past five years but we’ve changed this time.

When we have free time we’ll take a walk. I also like listening to Serbian music, and songs from the 1980s and 1990s. I’m a bit old school when it comes to that. But before a match I listen to DJs’ remixes of commercial sounds to get the adrenaline flowing.

Over the years you gain the experience to deal with the stress of playing, particularly at Wimbledon. After all, it’s the most important tournament we have and the pinnacle of the sport.

As the tournament progresses and the matches get tougher the tension rises and you feel that. Mentally, it drains you. You have to conserve energy off the court and be around people that you care about and make you feel relaxed. It’s very important when you’re in the middle of a Grand Slam.

I practise yoga, although not every day. Each day I do certain types of breathing exercises to help me relax and focus. The matches at Wimbledon are so important that you can easily get carried away, so you have to constantly work on yourself and try to get yourself in the best positive shape, physically and mentally.

I like the tradition of Wimbledon and England in general; the way culture and history is nurtured. Not many countries have succeeded in maintaining that sense of tradition.

You feel it here the most. We still have to wear all-white on the court and it gives Wimbledon that special sensation and flavour of being the oldest tournament we have.
