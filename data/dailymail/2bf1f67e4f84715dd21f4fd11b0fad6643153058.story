Sir David Nicholson has confessed to eight-pint beer binges while running the NHS.

The bureaucrat, who was branded ‘the man with no shame’ for presiding over the Mid Staffs hospital scandal, said: ‘I lost control of my health. And I was head of the NHS.’

Despite the appalling neglect at Mid Staffs, which cost up to 1,200 lives, Sir David was allowed to retire in March on a vast pension.

Sir David Nicholson admits to eight-pint drinking sessions while he was in charge of the NHS. He retired in March but was criticised for the Mid Staffs scandal

In a newspaper article, Sir David, 58,
 said: ‘I was brought up from the age of 14 to think that on Friday 
night, it’s eight pints of bitter, and did that through my 40s and into 
my 50s. Every Friday night I’d go out and have seven or eight pints.’

NHS
 guidelines state that men should not drink more than 21 units of 
alcohol a week – the amount its chief executive was drinking in a single
 evening. A pint of bitter typically contains two to three units of 
alcohol.

The NHS Choices 
website says: ‘Researchers define binge drinking as consuming eight or 
more units in a single session for men. You can easily lose control of 
what you do or say and may make risky decisions, thinking you’re 
invulnerable.’

Julie Bailey of Cure the NHS said she was not surprised by the confession. Her elderly mother died in dreadful circumstances in the care of Mid Staffordshire NHS trust

In Sir 
David’s Guardian article, he describes how he has given up beer, chips 
and unhealthy sauces after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes on 
Christmas Eve 2012.

He said 
he was spurred into taking action by the thought that he wanted to live 
‘for as long as I can’ to see his 18-month-old daughter Rosa growing up.

She
 was born, when Sir David was 57, to his second wife Sarah-Jane Marsh, 
who is 20 years his junior and the chief executive of Birmingham 
Children’s Hospital. He has two 20-something sons, Liam and Paul, from 
his first marriage.

He took over as NHS chief executive in 2006 when he was 50.

Sir
 David’s revelation about his alcohol consumption will anger relatives 
of the victims of the Mid Staffs scandal who believe he failed to get a 
grip on the crisis.

Last 
night campaigner Julie Bailey, of Cure the NHS, whose elderly mother 
died in dreadful circumstances in the care of Mid Staffordshire NHS 
trust, said she was not surprised by the confession. ‘Nothing shocks me 
about that man, but it explains a lot,’ she said.

‘He
 was going to the pub and having eight pints while supposedly being in 
charge of the NHS. It’s another example of NHS bosses telling us how to 
live our lives but doing the opposite in private.’

She
 added she was angry at another claim in the article, where Sir David 
states: ‘When I was the NHS chief executive people used to say that I 
famously had “grip”, that I knew what was going on and was in charge.’

The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust was blasted over the poor level of care patients received and the extraordinarily high number of patient deaths

Miss
 Bailey said: ‘That’s completely at odds with what he told the health 
select committee, which was that he could not possibly know, and did not
 know, what was going on everywhere in the NHS.’

Sir David maintained he was ‘obsessed’ by his work, but admitted his health suffered.

He
 wrote: ‘I had lost control of my health and my lifestyle. I had 
abdicated responsibility for my own health and allowed it to get out of 
control, even though I was chief executive of the NHS. The irony of that
 was huge.’

He said he also
 realised he had to tackle his weight, writing: ‘I didn’t think about 
the implications until I began growing out of all my clothes.

‘Thank
 heaven for Marks and Spencer’s elasticated waist trousers. I bought 
them with a 38 or 40-inch waist, but they expanded, so I could kid 
myself that my weight wasn’t as gross as it was.

‘When
 I saw the GP that Christmas Eve I weighed 111 kilogrammes – 17 stone 
and six pounds. Looking back, I had been in denial. I’d never, ever 
weighed myself.’

He said he had made radical changes to his lifestyle as part of efforts to manage his diabetes.

Sir
 David said his days of downing eight pints were over:  ‘I’ve now cut 
out beer altogether. So I’ve undergone a dramatic revolution in my 
lifestyle. I’ve lost about three stone and am doing my best to keep my 
weight down.’
