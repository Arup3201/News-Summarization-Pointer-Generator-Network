Staggering demand for computer tablets has seen British shoppers buy one every second as the rush for Christmas gifts goes into overdrive.

Some shops are reporting sales of tablets like the iPad and Google Nexus 7 are up by 1,000 per cent from last year, leading retailers to brand 2012 the 'tablet Christmas'.

The frenzy began last week on Cyber Monday when a tablet was sold every second, and it is forecasted demand will continue to be high during the countdown to Christmas.

Apple will be hoping to come on top of the sales charts again with its iPad Mini

But the California giant faces a battle with rival Google, which launched its Nexus 7 earlier this year

A spokesman for Dixons, which runs Curry's and PC World, told The Observer: 'We are still looking to sell a tablet every two seconds between now and Christmas.

'iPads were big last year, but the new devices that have come out this year have really opened up the market to a much wider audience.'

Top-of-the-range tablets are this year being sold between £159-£529, and retailers say a greater choice of products is fueling the sales rush.

Apple is not is as dominant this year as rivals have come out in force to rival its flagship iPad.

The Kindle Fire HD, Google Nexus 7, and the Nook HD are proving popular, although retailers say it is too early to say which brand will top the sales chart.

Other firms reported bumper sales. John Lewis saw a 250 per cent year-on-year rise, and said it expects a further boost in the next fortnight.

Argos said it hopes to sell a million tablets by the end of the year.

'We definitely believe this will be a tablet Christmas,' Argos technology trading manager Simon Barry told the paper.

'We are seeing more and more people wanting "my" tablet, rather than "our" tablet - with multiple devices going into homes.'

He added tablets aimed at children were expected to be popular, including the Nabi, which, according to maker Fuhu, is the 'world's first and most powerful tablet made just for kids'.

It lauched in Britain in October, costing £149.99, rivaling the Innotab 2, which is priced at £84.99 and aimed at four-to-nine-year-olds.

Cheaper tablets for adults like the basic CnM Touchpad, priced at £100, are also expected to sell well.
