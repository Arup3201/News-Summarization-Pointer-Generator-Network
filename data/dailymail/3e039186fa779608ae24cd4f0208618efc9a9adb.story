The Royal Navy launched an unarmed warhead in an awe-inspiring display of Britain's powerful nuclear deterrent.

The Trident II was blasted into the sky by HMS Vigilant, a nuclear-powered Vanguard Class submarine, in the Atlantic just off the coast of Florida. The Navy has not test-fired a ballistic missile since 2009.

Navy chiefs said the successful launch confirms the credibility of the UK's nuclear deterrent.

First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope said: 'The Royal Navy has for over 43 years continuously operated the UK’s nuclear deterrent to stringent safety standards and HMS Vigilant’s latest test firing before she returns to the patrol cycle reflects that successful deterrence is based upon strong determination.

'One of the core roles of the Royal Navy, the Continuous At Sea Deterrent remains an enduring strategic capability, underpinning our nation’s commitment to the preservation of peace in our uncertain world.'

News of the launch comes at the same time Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced an additional £350M worth of funding for the next stage of design work for Successor, the future generation of UK nuclear-armed submarines.

He added that the investment will sustain 1,200 UK jobs and makes clear the Government’s commitment to maintaining a deterrence for future decades. The funding follows the initial £350M of design work announced earlier this year.

The Vanguard submarines will be replaced from 2028 by the Successor, which is currently being designed by British companies.

Britain's nuclear subs are based at Faslane on the River Clyde in Scotland and uncertainty surrounds its future should the Scottish vote for independence in 2014.

The SNP wants to remove the subs from the site, bhe Royal Navy says all Royal Navy submarines will be based at Faslane by 2017, including the Astute and Trafalgar class attack submarines.

The successful launch took place off the coast of Florida in the U.S. and used America's telemetry and tracking systems

Mr Hammond claims the site is secure. He said: 'We are confident that the Scottish people will choose to remain part of the United Kingdom.

'The Faslane complex is the largest employment site in Scotland with over 6,500 jobs underpinning the local economy.

'We have no plans to move the nuclear deterrent from the Clyde. On the contrary, we intend to move the Astute and Trafalgar Class attack submarines to Faslane, creating a further 1,500 jobs.

'The Scottish Government needs to explain how their policy would benefit Scotland’s economy and safeguard Scottish jobs.'
