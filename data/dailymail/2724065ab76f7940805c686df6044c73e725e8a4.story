Amateur ghost hunters claim they have made contact with the spirit of Richard III, next to the bed where the king reportedly spent his last night.

Members of the paranormal investigation group Haunted Heritage said they recorded the spooky encounter at Donington le Heath Manor House, Leicestershire, last year.

But they said they did not want to publicise the recording at the time because of the furore surrounding the discovery of the king's remains under a Leicester car park.

It is believed that King Richard III spent the night at the house before riding out to the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 and dying on the battlefield.

King Richard III was defeated by Henry Tudor and the battle is regarded as one of the most defining moments in British history.

During a recording, the group ask: 'What is your name' a reply of 'Richard' can then be heard. The group then say: 'Thank you so much for that.'

Medium Gill Hibbert, 56, from Coalville, Leicestershire said: 'It was in the main room upstairs in the manor house - it was coming up to the witching hour.

'We had been there since 8pm. At about 11.45pm, we started the call-out session.

'We were standing in the dark, but there was a bit of light coming in through the window.'

Mrs Hibbert said she asked if anyone was there and then said: 'come forward'.

Richard III's remains were discovered by archaeologists in 2012. His body was buried in what was Grey Friars Church, Leicester, after his death. The site later became a council car park

She then switched on the ghost box - a modified radio which allows spirits to 'speak' through white noise - and called out again.

She said: 'Then we heard the name, 'Richard' - it was so clear. We were blown away.

'The night was quite uneventful up until then - we had a few knocks and bangs - but when that came through it was the icing on the cake.'

Mrs Hibbert said the voice was one of the best examples of paranormal contact the group had witnessed.

They have given the recording an 'A' grade because of the clarify of the sound.

The group has now contacted professional paranormal investigators so that the recording can be analysed further.

Donington le Heath Manor House is said to be the place where Richard III spent his final night

Mrs Hibbert said: 'We're not saying it's Richard III.

'We're trying to get a historian from Donington le Heath to look into other Richards who have lived there.

'But no one has found anything yet. We are being careful about saying it's Richard III because we can't prove it.'

Richard's remains were discovered by archaeologists in 2012. His body was buried in what was Grey Friars Church, Leicester, after his death. The site later became a council car park.

A legal row is now ongoing between those who want him re-interred at Leicester Cathedral and others who say he should be laid to rest at York Minster.
