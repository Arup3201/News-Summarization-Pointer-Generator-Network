It may not be the most common father-daughter bonding exercise, but for this Texan teenager and her alligator-catching dad, it's all in a day's work.

'Gator' Chris Stephens was called out to the Sienna Plantation neighbourhood, in Missouri City, after a large alligator was spotted in a pond.

Mr Stephens, a licensed nuisance hunter, also enlisted the help of his 13-year-old daughter Taylor, however, in his bid to capture the animal for the safety of the residents.

Mr Stephens was called out after the large alligator was spotted in a pond, so he took his daughter along to help

After waiting patiently for a number of hours, Mr Stephens managed to catch the animal and bring it ashore, with the help of his daughter, KHOU.com has reported.

Taylor not only helped hold on to the rod but also covered the alligator's head after climbing on top of it.

When it comes to helping her father out however, Taylor hardly finds it disconcerting.

She said: 'I've been doing it since I was four, so it's not scary. It's more of a routine.'

After capturing the reptile, Mr Stephens warned residents who had gathered in the area not to feed alligators in case they get too big and start attacking people.

He said: 'The next person may have their chihuahua with them, and the gator's not mean, he's just thinking - wow, they brought me a chihuahua today.'

Following its capture, the animal was due to be taken to an alligator farm in El Campo.

In an unrelated incident earlier this month, teachers preparing for the first day of classes at a Texas school got an early morning surprise in the form of an alligator at the back door.

Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office deputies were called out to capture the animal on Wednesday, August 13, at Beck Junior High.

An employee alerted authorities that the seven-foot alligator was outside so they could remove it before students returned to campus.

Authorities found the reptile across campus near some air conditioning units.

'One of our deputies is kind of a veteran at doing this type of thing,' Bob Haenel of the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office told ABC.

'After several attempts of trying to rope the alligator, he managed to put a towel over the gator’s head to calm him down and then roped him.'

The alligator was then taken to a 'more natural habitat' than the school yard.
