China publicly intervened for the first time in America’s looming debt crisis yesterday, demanding the US take 'concrete measures' to prevent a default on government debt that could be globally catastrophic.

China is the U.S’s biggest foreign creditor, holding at least £794 billion in US Treasury bonds, and its leaders warned Washington against jeopardising its huge stake in the American economy.

Expressing concern over the continuing deadlock in Washington about raising the government’s debt ceiling, China’s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, said the 'clock was ticking' for the U.S.

As the world’s two biggest economies, 'China and the US are inseparable,' he said.

Referring to a similar Washington impasse in 2011 that led to the humiliating downgrading of America’s credit rating, Mr Zhu said: 'We hope the United States fully understands the lessons of history.'

The U.S. has until October 17th to agree to raise its debt ceiling or the Treasury will run out of money to pay what it owes.

Shares on Wall Street and in Europe continued to fall yesterday as the US government headed into a second week of a partial shutdown with no signs of any agreement over the budget.

The White House reiterated that President Barack Obama will not negotiate with the Republicans over the threat of a debt default, the first in U.S. history.

Aides say Mr Obama believes that negotiating will set a dangerous precedent for future debt ceiling talks.

Yesterday, Mr Obama said he believed Congress would vote both to reopen government and to raise the debt limit if they did it now.

'My very strong suspicion is there are enough votes there' to pass legislation, he said. 'Hold a vote. Call a vote right now. Let’s see what happens.'

However, the Republicans control the House of Representatives. And Republican House Speaker John Boehner vowed on Sunday not to raise the U.S. debt ceiling without a 'serious conversation' about what is driving the debt.

With tensions rising in Congress, Democrats countered that their opponents are being irresponsible and reckless to raise the possibility of the US defaulting.

The chances of a deal are further hampered by the increasingly venomous war of words between the two main leaders in Congress - Mr Boehner and Democrat Senate leader Harry Reid.

The gathering storm: Shares fell as Obama reiterated he would not negotiate with the Republicans

Yesterday, a spokesman for Mr Reid accused Mr Boehner of 'refusing to come to grips with reality' and saying 'things that fly in the face of facts'.

White House economic chief Gene Sperling has suggested that Washington could buy some more time to reach a deal if Congress approved a bill to boost the debt ceiling for a few weeks.

Conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives have been accused of holding the U.S. to ransom by resisting a deal to keep funding the government unless Mr Obama agrees to delay his healthcare reforms.

Many Republicans want a similar condition, as well as others to cut the huge US deficit, placed on raising the debt ceiling.

The two parties faced off over the same issue two years ago, agreeing only to a last-minute deal after pressure from the financial markets.

Mr Obama has already appealed to Wall Street to force the hand of the Republicans once again.

But investors are hardly reassured. Shares on European markets fell to a four-month low on Monday with those on Wall Street tumbling even lower.
