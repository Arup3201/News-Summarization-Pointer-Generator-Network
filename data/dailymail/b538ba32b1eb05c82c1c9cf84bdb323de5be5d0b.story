An overturned tanker caused traffic chaos after it flooded a country road with hundreds of gallons of milk.

The road was closed for four hours as firefighters and experts from the Environment Agency desperately tried to mop up the spilled milk after the lorry overturned in rural Shropshire.

The driver of the Robert Wiseman Dairies lorry was initially trapped but was freed by emergency workers and treated for minor facial injuries following the accident near Shifnal.

The clear-up team were anxious to keep the milk from flowing into rivers or streams.

Darren Smith, incident commander from Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Milk is one of the worst things in the watercourse as it kills everything.

'But
we managed to stem the flow, and initially used buckets and matts to 
mop up the milk but it mostly went into a grass verge.'

The lorry 
overturned on Pickmere Island on the junction of the A41 and A5, near 
Shifnal at around 2.50pm on Wednesday.
