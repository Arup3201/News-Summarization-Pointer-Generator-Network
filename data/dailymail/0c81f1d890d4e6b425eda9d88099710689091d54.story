The father of National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden told Russian television that he is grateful to President Vladimir Putin and his government for protecting his son.

Speaking to the state-owned Rossiya 24 channel in footage broadcast Wednesday, Lon Snowden of Allentown, Pennsylvania, thanked the Kremlin for the 'courage' shown in keeping his son safe.

Addressing his son, Lon Snowden said that 'your family is well and we love you.' He added that 'I hope to see you soon, but most of all I want you to be safe.'

Lonnie Snowden said he would not fly to Russia to serve as an 'emotional tool' in the United States' efforts to persuade his son to surrender

Lon Snowden, a former U.S. Coast Guard, also said in an interview with the Washington Post that he asked to speak with his son but the FBI told him it wasn't possible. Instead they asked him to visit his son in Moscow.

Speaking
to Washington Post reporter Jerry Markon, the supportive father said: 
'I was asked if I would consider flying to Moscow. And I said "yes, but 
however, I want to know what the objective is and I want to be able to 
speak to my son to see if there is value, because I'm not going to fly 
to Moscow to sit on the tarmac to be an emotional tool for you, for the 
government.'

The younger Snowden has been stuck in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since arriving from Hong Kong on June 23. Russia is considering his request for temporary asylum, which he submitted on July 16.

Putin has warned that Snowden could be granted asylum on condition he agrees not to hurt U.S. interests - implying that the American would have to stop leaking material on Washington's spying efforts.

Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, has said the fugitive told him he could meet that demand.

The Guardian newspaper on Wednesday made a new report on U.S. intelligence-gathering based on information from Snowden, but Kucherena said the material was provided before Snowden promised to stop leaking.

'He warned me that he had already sent to the press an array of revealing information and secret documents and, unfortunately, could not stop its publication,' Kucherena was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Snowden has been living at the airport for five weeks, awaiting Russian visa papers to be able to leave and seek asylum

Snowden, who revealed details of a U.S. intelligence program to monitor Internet activity, has received offers of asylum from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia. However, the logistics of reaching any of those countries are complicated because his U.S. passport has been revoked.

Snowden would need the country he wants to reach to issue him travel documents and he would have to find a way to get there. The only direct commercial flight to the region, one that goes to Havana, Cuba, flies over Europe and the U.S., which could cause complications. Some European countries refused to allow Bolivian President Evo Morales to fly through their airspace on his way home from Moscow earlier this month due to suspicions Snowden was on his plane.

The elder Snowden said that, considering those issues, his son's best option may be to stay in Russia.

'If it were me, I would stay in Russia and that's what I hope my son will do,' he said, adding that he hopes to be able to visit him in Moscow.

Anatoly Kucherena (L), the Russian lawyer assisting Snowden, told media at Sheremetyevo airport last week that Snowden has been granted the papers that will allow him to leave the transit area of a Moscow airport where he is holed up

Kucherena told the Vesti-FM radio station on Wednesday that he is arranging for Snowden's father to visit Russia. Kucherena said that he would send Lon Snowden a letter of invitation to Russia later on Wednesday.

Kucherena said that Snowden asked him to get in touch with his father because 'he needs moral support.'

The elder Snowden told Russian television that he feels proud of his son. 'My son is a principled young man, he is a man of courage and what he saw he couldn't live with,' he said. 'I know that I have raised him to do the right thing. Sometimes the right thing means personal sacrifice, and that's what he did.'

To the Post, the father backed his son's position and described him as 'wholesome' and patriotic'.

He said his son grew up in Maryland surrounded by federal agents and law enforcers in his family, but Edward was always the 'brilliant one'. 'I have never known him to be cruel or harsh with anyone at any time,' he said.

Snowden Jr began working in intelligence in 2003, he told the reporter, under the Bush administration; he saw how things evolved, he told the reporter.

With the arrival of the Obama administration he hoped that things would change, but Snowden Sr said rather than getting better, things got worse.

Since leaking the National Security Documents to Wikileaks, Snowden Jr has been trapped in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, unable to travel and seek asylum elsewhere because the U.S. revoked his passport.

His father believes he is doing the right thing remaining in Russia, since he says the U.S. institutions and media have generated 'propaganda' about his son and he would not be given a fair trial if he were to return.

He said: 'Where at this point, unless someone's been living in a cave without a TV, can my son get a fair trial?'

He said, based on the behavior of the
U.S. government, both the Congress and Justice departments, he has lost
confidence that they are operating in good faith.

He described the operations of the U.S. leaders as 'absolutely amateurish'.
