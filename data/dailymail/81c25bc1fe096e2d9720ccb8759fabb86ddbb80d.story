Kim Kardashian is not shy about her love of waist training, but according to one expert, the reality star's regular use of a corset to shrink her stomach could be affecting her fertility.

The 34-year-old, who told Daily Mail Online about her struggle to conceive a second child with Kanye West, took a selfie of her enviable frame strapped into a black waist trainer on Tuesday.

But  Dr Sue Decotiis tells us that the practice of wearing a waist trainer or corset over periods to change ones shape is ‘not healthy.'

'Waist training does not reduce the amount of body fat. The small waist circumference may have been a result of the highly constricting corset that reduced blood flow to the tissues and causing atrophy of these tissues.'

She adds: 'For pregnancy, these tissues might not be able to expand to accommodate a developing fetus.'

Not all medical experts agree however. Dr Lauren Streicher says wearing a corset while trying to get conceive has 'no effect on fertility or early pregnancy.'

Kim told Daily Mail Online about her struggle to conceive last Friday.

'It's been more challenging to get pregnant the second time around," she said at the E! International Press Junket in Los Angeles.  

'When you're not planning it, it happens. It's just how God works. And when you want it so bad, it's not happening... '

Kim explained that she is documenting her battle on the upcoming season of Keeping Up With The Kardashian to help other women, noting that Kanye supports her decision to share the experience.

Kim, who gave birth to her daughter North in June 2013, began wearing a waist trainer last August and has been thrilled with the results.

Her sister Khloe Kardashian and other celebrities including Jessica Alba, Amber Rose and Blac Chyna have also used a corset to shape their tiny waists.

Of course, today's celebrities didn't invent waist training. Women have been wearing corsets throughout history, as far back as the 1500s - even during pregnancy. 

Kim recently revealed in an in interview Elle UK that she has been battling issues with her fertility long before she started started waist training.

'A few years ago I was told I could never get pregnant.'

'Three different doctors told me the same thing, which is why I wanted to have my eggs frozen,' she recalled. 'I was just about to do that when I found out I was pregnant with North.'
