The bodies of a 16-year-old boy and his 52-year-old father were found at a River Ridge, Louisiana, home on Friday.

The boy, Matthew Tarto, had been dead for several days before his father Mark Tarto died. Autopsy results revealed that both died from gunshot wounds to the head.

Investigators at Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office suspect Mark Tarto murdered his son, then committed suicide several days later.

Murder/suicide: Autopsy results confirmed that 16-year-old Matthew Tarto had been dead for several days before his father, Mark Tarto, committed suicide at the River Ridge home the two shared, according to authorities

'This has all the earmarks of an apparent murder-suicide, and the autopsy supports that finding,' Colonel John Fortunato, spokesman for the Sheriff's Office, told The Times-Picayune.

Authorities discovered the bodies after Mark Tarto's ex-wife Lisa Tarto became concerned that she hadn't heard from her child.

The John Curtis Christian School where Matthew was a sophomore was also alerted after teachers noticed he had been absent since May 14.

Matthew Tarto's football coach J.T. Curtis said it was unusual for Matthew to be away from school.

'He was a good student who was
extremely conscientious,' he said. 'That's what was so 
unusual, for him to be out of school. He just doesn't miss.'

Curtis said school officials called the 
Tarto home five times in the 10-day period between Matthew Tarto's May
14th absence and the discovery of the bodies on May 24.

According to Curtis, the school was informed by Mark Tarto that his son was suffering a lung infection.

'We checked again later in the week and 
he was still sick,' Curtis said. 'We checked in the first part of the 
next week and we were told he was going to get a chest X-ray.'

Matthew Tarto died from a gunshot 
wound to the back of his head.

Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich said his body was found in 
bed, and that it's likely he was shot while sleeping.

Mark
Tarto's wounds are consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, 
according to Fortunato.

Deputies found his body in the living room 
beside a semi-automatic pistol.

Curtis told The Picayune-Tribune that the news Matthew had been killed by his father was hard to believe.

'When I tell you those two were as close as you could be, I could not be any more shocked,' he said.

Court documents reveal, however, that Mark Tarto was the subject of allegations of abuse.Â 

According to The Advocate, when Lisa Tarto filed for divorce from Mark Tarto in the 24th Judicial District Court in 2008, she
told the court he accused her repeatedly of infidelity, interrogated her
friends about it and kept her up at night arguing with her.

He 
threatened her and belittled her in front of their
son, she said.

Lisa Tarto cancelled the 
divorce proceedings to reconcile with her husband, only for Mark Tarto 
to file for divorce in 2010, asking for custody and alimony, and 
claiming he was 'free from fault' in the collapse of their marriage.

But Lisa Tarto alleged 'habitual cruel treatment' 
and 'extreme mental abuse' court records show.

Lisa Tarto told the court that Mark Tarto
had cursed her, threatened to ruin her life and cut up her clothing.

She said Mark Tarto exhibited 'unstable mental behavior'.

She alleged that he had 
'brain-washed' their son and turned him against her, making Matthew 
believe she had been unfaithful to his father.

The court granted the divorce in October 2011 and the couple finalized a custody settlement in January.

Curtis
said students and friends are preparing for Matthew Tarto's funeral, 
scheduled for today in New Orleans.

'That will stir up a lot of 
emotion,' he told the local paper.

The
John Curtis Christian School website says the school made 
counselors available to students and teachers struggling to deal with 
their grief.

'The teachers, especially those who 
taught him and had him in the past, struggled with it,' Curtis said. 'It
was very emotional.'

Matthew Tarto was a backup offensive lineman on the school's 2012 Class 2A state championship football team.

'He was the kind of son any mother would hope for,' Curtis told WWLTV.

The school's Twitter feed is full of tweets about Matthew Tarto.

'Saw a guy in a Hoover High shirt. All I could think about was Joe McKnight and John Curtis owning the Bucs in 2006' wrote @garlandgillen.

Matthew Tarto's teammates, cheerleaders and their parents gathered on Saturday for the school's annual spring scrimmage, some wearing Matthew Tarto's No. 56 on their cheeks.

Tuesday was the last day of class for the school year, but Curtis said the school had emailed parents and asked them to notify the school if any students were displaying signs of difficulties or anxieties.

'We're going through a healing process,' he said.

An online obituary has been set up for Matthew where friends and acquaintances can share memories of his life.
