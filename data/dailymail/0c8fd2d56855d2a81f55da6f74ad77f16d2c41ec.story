Mr Cradick  contacted Patterson after she left a left negative feedback for his service on behalf of a friend.

Lithgow mother of two Chloe Patterson, 27, received a string of abusive messages after she left a negative review on a dog-minding Facebook page

Ms Patterson, an apprentice mechanic, said her friend was initially abused after she requested a quote from Mr Cradick. 

'I left a review describing his poor customer service. He messaged me back from his personal Facebook to say he had removed the review, before he started harassing me.' 

In the lewd messages, Mr Cradik said she should get a job at a strip club since and offer 'extra services'.

'By the looks of your profile no wonder you could not afford dog minding with all those kids. What is your problem? Can you not keep your legs shut?' he wrote.

' Also maybe put those pole dancing skills to good use by getting a job at Porky's Night Spot or the Love Machine at Kings Cross. You could make more money by offering extra services to the mean, then you will be able to afford dog minding lol.'

Ms Patterson said she was appalled by the messages, which she had only discovered recently in her 'other' Facebook inbox

Ms Patterson said she is yet to receive an apology and plans to pursue the matter with police

Ms Patterson said she was appalled by the messages, which she had only discovered recently in her 'other' Facebook inbox.

'I was pretty amused he was lashing out at me over a one line review, but it was pretty disturbing that he was abusing me for being a mother,' she said.

'I was determined to share the message so no people would have to deal wiyth such a pathetic man.' 

She has received a torrent of support since posting the message, with people quickly responding to from far and wide.

But Mr Cradick has still yet to apologise. 'He continues to claim I brought this upon myself, and that he's powerful enough to do whatever he wants.'

'I plan to pursue this matter with the police. I have received a lot of messages that show this was not an isolated incident. I want him to be held responsible for his behaviour.'
