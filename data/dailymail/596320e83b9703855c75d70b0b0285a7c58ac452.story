Pictures of the large hospital complex that helped Adolf Hitler recuperate after being wounded in the leg at battle have emerged showing it as a ghost town.

Beelitz-Heilstätten, in Brandenburg, Germany, is home to the large hospital complex of about 60 buildings, including a cogeneration plant erected from 1898.

Photographer Kate Berry went to the complex to capture its eerie atmosphere on camera, so many years since Hitler's death.

It was originally designed by architect Heino Schmieden as a sanatorium by the Berlin workers' health insurance corporation.

But from the beginning of World War I the complex became a military hospital for the German army.

During
October and November 1916, Hitler recuperated at Beelitz-Heilstätten 
after being shot in the leg at the Battle of the Somme.

In
1945, Beelitz-Heilstätten was occupied by the then-Soviet Union’s Red 
Army forces, and the complex remained a Russian military hospital until 
1995, well after the German reunification.

Following the Soviet withdrawal, attempts were made to privatise the complex, but they were not entirely successful.

Some
sections of the hospital remain in operation as a neurological 
rehabilitation centre and as a centre for research and to care for 
victims of Parkinsons disease.

The remainder of the complex, including the surgery, the psychiatric ward, and a rifle range, was abandoned in 2000.

As
of 2007, none of the abandoned hospital buildings were secured, nor the
surrounding area, giving it all the feel of a ghost town.

This
has made Beelitz-Heilstätten a destination for curious visitors and a 
film set for movies like The Pianist in 2002 and the 2008 Tom Cruise 
film, Valkyrie.

Perhaps Hitler once walked up these steps in this abandoned building

Visitors come from all over the world to see the abandoned old hospital complex which is unused. Because it has not been secured, the area has a ghost town feel to it and is a stark reminder of the time during Adolf Hitler
