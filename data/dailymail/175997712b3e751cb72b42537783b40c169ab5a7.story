Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the newspapers from abroad to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

And there's only one story on the footballing world's mind - Brazil's 7-1 hammering at the hands of finalists Germany.

The majority of media from Spain and Italy hone in on the previous World Cup favourites Brazil's humiliation in front of their own supporters on Tuesday night, and don't hold back in doing so.

Sport

Sport say Brazil suffered the worst 'humiliation' in their history, and believe the hosts 'failed' in front of their own fans.

Corriere dello Sport

Brazil captain David Luiz is shown, looking deflated, below a large seven, with the word 'humiliated' used again by an Italian newspaper. They say it was a 'historic collapse by Brazil' and remind us that 'Germany are in the final'.

AS

A strong front page from Spanish newspaper AS, who label the Brazil defeat a 'world massacre'. They stick the knife into boss Luiz Felipe Scolari, writing: 'Tiki-taka gives Scolari what he deserves.'

Tuttosport

Italian newspaper Tuttosport remind their readers how it was 'an incredible night in Belo Horizonte as Brazil let in five goals in the first 29 minutes'. They say Brazil finished 'humiliated and depressed'.

La Razon

Manchester City's Fernandinho takes centre stage of La Razon, as his devastation in the back of the net sums up Brazil's night on Tuesday.

ABC

Luiz, clearly distraught after leading his side to the worst-ever defeat in a World Cup semi-final, waves goodbye to the crowd and to the competition. There's that familiar word again: 'Humiliation.'

Marca

One of Spain's leading newspapers label the 7-1 defeat: 'World humiliation'. Marca say it is 'more embarrassing than the Maracanazo' - a reference to Brazil's 1950 shame as the hosts lost the World Cup to Uruguay.

They go on to describe how the 'Germans submit and torment Brazil to a football master class and goals' during the 'historic thrashing'.

Mundo Deportivo

'Humiliation,' reads Mundo Deportivo's headline, with the scoreline in the centre. 'A sensational Germany inflict the worst defeat of La Canarinha's history. A German exhibition puts them in their eighth final.'

La Gazzetta dello Sport

La Gazzetta dello Sport show the devastation of Brazilians and the joy of Germans, writing: 'Germany batter Brazil 7-1. Just sadness. The Germans, beautiful and ruthless, throw an entire country into depression.'
