Twitter debt worth £1.1billion ($1.7billion) has been rated as 'junk' by a U.S. credit agency causing the value of shares to be slashed by 6 per cent.

Standard and Poor's said the 'speculative' rating was issued because the social network is pouring cash into expanding its user numbers while still operating at a loss.

The agency warned that it could be 2016 before the social network turns a profit. In the latest quarter of this year Twitter posted a net loss of £112million ($175.5million), despite a surge in earnings.

S&P's said in order to improve the rating, Twitter needed to develop more ways of making money, launch new products, and improve its earnings.

The company has been aggressively buying up other firms in order to add to its appeal, boosting regular user numbers to around the 264million mark.

However, that figure means it still lags far behind the likes of Facebook, which has 864million active users, making it more attractive to advertisers.

However, it is not all bad news for Twitter, which first launched in 2006 and listed as a public company last year.

S&P's said that, in the short-term at least, Twitter 'will continue to experience very strong growth and not encounter a significant increase in competitive pressure.'

The agency added: 'We expect the company to experience very high growth over the next two to three years as it expands internationally and grows revenue as well.'
