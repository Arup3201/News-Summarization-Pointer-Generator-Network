The mother of Rosie Kremer, who died of an undiagnosed brain stem tumour just hours after giving birth, has been thanked by the woman who received her kidney.

Rosie, 24, died six hours after her baby was born. Throughout her pregnancy doctors had insisted she was suffering labyrinthitis, an inner ear infection.

Mother Lesley, 57, together with sisters Ruth, 30, and Joanne, 28, took the agonising decision to allow Rosie's organs to be donated and eight people's lives were saved as a result.

Overwhelmed: Lesley Kremer, with grandson Bobby, is the mother of Rosie Kremer, who died of an undiagnosed brain stem tumour after giving birth. She has been thanked by the woman who received her daughter's kidney

Mrs Kremer, from Penrith, Cumbria, who is bringing up grandson Bobby, says she received a 'massive boost' when a three-page letter arrived from the anonymous recipient.

It tells how the married mother-of-two's health had been deteriorating for 15 years before Rosie saved her life.

It was quickly followed by messages of gratitude from her daughter and husband.

She said: 'I absolutely bawled my eyes out when I got them, all of the family did.

'It made it seem real and it was lovely. For somebody to say "I'm alive because I have been given your daughter's kidney", was just amazing.

'It is a massive comfort to know she has had her life back and I'm so glad. She seems like such a nice person.'

The letter says: 'I was so frightened but it's a strange feeling knowing that some kind-hearted person had made the choice to help a stranger and I was that scared but so, so grateful.

'What a testament to this wonderful woman to want to help others this way.

'Since the transplant, my life has changed so much and my outlook on life is more positive.

'I have far more energy, chores are manageable and I'm awake for long enough to find out what's happening in my children's lives.

'I remind myself every day how lucky I am and try not to allow myself to get low or angry about the unimportant things.'

The anonymous mother signs off by vowing to take the very best care of Rosie's gift. She says: 'I now have a life back that I had forgotten I had.

'The illness kind of creeps up over the years and you forget what you were able to do.

'I'm doing my very best to look after my wonderful, unique gift your loved one has shared with me and I intend to continue to do so.

'Again, thank you so much and I thank your special lady, who is in my thoughts every day.'

Mrs Kremer agreed for her daughter's heart, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, liver, stomach and bowel to be donated following her death on May 29, 2012, as a tribute to her late husband, Peter, who died of cancer 11 years ago.

He had always wanted to be a donor but was unsuitable due to his illness.

In September, she accepted the Order of St John Award on behalf of Rosie which recognised her gift and she believes it is only Bobby and the organ donation which has kept her grief from becoming too much.

She said: 'It is a positive at a time when we need as many positives as we can get.

'It is difficult to believe I am not going to see her again. The whole process with organ donation was massively comforting.

'She died, but at the same time something amazing was happening. It got us through those days, otherwise I don't know how we would have coped.'

In Scotland and England, people must choose to join the Organ Donor Register but in Wales a new law which comes into force in 2015 will mean people will have to opt out. Mrs Kremer has joined the calls for it to be introduced in England.

She added: 'I want to get people to think about joining the Organ Donor Register and it is an important time to show how worthwhile it is.'

She says Rosie lost two stone during pregnancy, was violently sick, slurred her speech and started to lose coordination of her limbs.

Yet she says that at no point during the last two months of her life did any of the 23 doctors who saw her indicate that she was gravely ill.

Lesley said she later learned that even an hour before her death Rosie could have made a full recovery if her condition had been correctly diagnosed and fluid had been drained from her brain.

Mrs Kramer is now suing North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages Cumberland Hospital, in Carlisle.

Rosie, who worked as a nursery nurse, and lived in Penrith, began suffering a loss of appetite, headaches, dizziness and sickness, early on in her pregnancy.

She was declared brain dead at 10.30am on 29 May 2012. Less than six hours earlier, at 4.30am, doctors delivered her baby boy, who she'd already named Bobby Peter, at 29 weeks. He weighed 2lb 14oz. Rosie had been transferred to Newcastle.

Mrs Kremer agreed for her daughter's heart, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, liver, stomach and bowel to be donated following her death as a tribute to her late husband, Peter, who died of cancer 11 years ago

Lesley said: "The care she received was appalling. There was no joined-up care. She was sent home twice from hospital.

'There was a note somewhere about cranial pressure, but despite all her symptoms nobody ever diagnosed a tumour. They weren't looking at the overall picture.

'Towards the end she was crying in pain and begging to die.

'Even then nobody was prepared to believe it was anything other than labyrithitis.

'I just kept asking people to help her. She became a zombie, she said the pain was so bad she wanted to die.

'Rosie had had a lot to deal with. She lost her dad to cancer when she was 14, and was very badly affected by it.

'Yes, she was drama queen, and she was a bit of a hypochondriac and she was scared that something would happen to her.'

Rosie spent the last five weeks of her life in bed, unable to sit up or use her hands. A CT scan carried out after brain death revealed a very large brain stem tumour on the right side.

Mrs Kramer said: 'I honestly didn't know what was the matter, but everyone seemed convinced she was just having a bad pregnancy.

'It didn't have to kill her. If somebody had spotted it she would have been fine, she would have recovered.'
