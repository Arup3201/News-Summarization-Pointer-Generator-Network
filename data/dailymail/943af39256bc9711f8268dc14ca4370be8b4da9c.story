The last surviving member of a trio of three British brothers fighting for al-Qaeda in Syria says he will not return home because jihad requires 'commitment'.

Amer Deghayes, 20, has vowed to stay in the Middle East until 'all Muslim lands' are 'ruled by Islam', despite the deaths of his brothers Abdullah, 18, and Jaffar, 17.

Amer left his hometown of Brighton almost a year ago in order to work in Syria as part of an aid convoy, but began fighting for al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda linked group.

Amer Deghayes, 20, has vowed to stay in Syria and keep fighting until all Muslim lands are 'ruled by Islam' despite his brothers Abdullah, 18, and Jaffar, 17, being killed

Abdullah, 18 (left), was killed fighting in Lakatia province in April after being shot in the chest by a sniper, while Jaffar, 17, died in a battle near Aleppo three weeks ago

His brothers joined him earlier this year after sneaking out of the family home, but Abdullah was killed by a sniper in Lakatia in April, while Jaffar died fighting last month.

Asked if he would return home to spare his parents any more heartbreak, Amer replied: 'Nope. Jihad nowadays isn't for tasters, it's a commitment.

'Not until all Muslim lands are liberated from infidels and is ruled by Islam then I can think about it.

'If I want to come back I will and no one can stop me except for Allah. If the whole world unites against you, they can't have an effect. Only Allah can.'

Since travelling to Syria, Amer has been in regular contact with his parents Abubaker Deghayes and Einas Abulsayen via Skype.

It was during two such phonecalls that be broke the news that his brothers had been killed.

The first call came in April. Speaking about Abdullah's death at the time, Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest.

'He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.'

Asked whether he would return to his home in Brighton to save father Abubaker (pictured) more heartbreak, Amer replied: 'Nope. Jihad nowadays isn't for tasters, it's a commitment.'

Three weeks ago Mr Deghayes got another call, this time to say Jaffar was dead. Mr Deghayes added: 'I can only hope and pray to God to accept him and have mercy on him.’

Yesterday David Cameron outlined new powers to prevent British jihadists who travel abroad to fight from returning to the UK.

The Prime Minister said the special exclusion orders, which could last for more than two years, would stop fighters returning to the country unless they agreed to strict conditions.

Under the Temporary Exclusion Orders, Brits suspected of fighting with radical Islamist militants would be stopped from re-entering the UK unless they gave themselves up at the border.

The returning jihadis would have their passports cancelled and their names added to a no-fly list that would prevent them from travelling back to this country.

They would only be allowed to return if they agreed to be escorted by police before facing prosecution or close supervision under monitoring laws.
