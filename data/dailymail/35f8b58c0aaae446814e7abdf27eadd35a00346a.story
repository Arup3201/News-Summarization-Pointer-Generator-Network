Imagine turning up to a Tinder date for the first time, only to be asked to have your photo taken as part of an art exhibition.

Australian photographer Kirra Cheers used the online dating app, which has a reputation for its 'hook-up' culture, as an opportunity to discover the true meaning behind modern romance.

Her exhibition 'Tinderella' - a common byline used by attractive females on Tinder - explores the reactions of 17 dates with the 27-year-old over two months.

While Cheers only exposed herself to the online dating scene two years ago - when she first moved to New York and used the app as a tool to meet new people in a foreign city - she's turned her experience to document her honest connection with her confidants. And she founds the results were quite surprising.

In most cases, she developed a strong relationship with her subjects while also being asked to 'charm my sack' by a Tinder romantic.

Kirra Cheers decided to test out Tinder for the first time when she moved to New York about two years ago. She initially used it to meet new people and also explore the new city

The Australian photographer based in New York went on 17 dates, 11 of which allowed her to take photos of them, as part of her project on modern romance

The 27-year-old first used Tinder as a tool to meet people in a foreign city. While the photographer says she's had positive experience on the online dating app, she doesn't believe it would be a place where she'd find 'the one'.

'I initially signed up for Tinder because I was single and I had just moved to another country so it was a chance for me to get out and see the city,' she said. 

'I had a good experience although I know a lot of people talk about how it's used as a sex hook up. But I've personally met great people through Tinder - some fabulous men and close friends.

'I think it's a useful tool to make friends and connect with people. But I'm not sure whether it’s the right place to look for a long lasting relationship due to the immediacy of the app. I think people are less willing to put time into a relationship these days.'

Once hitting the American dating scene, Cheers - who grew up in Adelaide - also found it was quite different from what she was used to in Australia.

'Online dating in Australia is only just becoming socially acceptable whereas in New York it's the main platform to meet people,' she said.

'Dating is also very formalised here and it's socially accepted to be dating three or four people at a time so I think some women get frustrated with that.'

Dan who's a 26-year-old and works as an illustrator. Kirra met up with Dan at a bar. He is among the 11 Tinder dates who allowed her to take a photo

This was the inspiration behind her body of work quite aptly named Tinderella - a collection of black and white portraits from 11 of the 17 dates she had in June and July.

'I really wanted to go out with people I genuinely wanted to date and photograph the connection I had with them,' she said. 

From the experience, she gained 11 follow up dates and developed close friendships. But she also encountered the reality behind Tinder and perhaps what constitutes as 'romance' for some in today's day and age.

'Matt hit me up for sex right away but I think through the conversation - before you meet the person - you're able to tell if the person has an agenda,' Cheers said.

'It really depends on what you're looking for. If it's purely appearance based then I think you'll have an infavourable experience.'

Cheers says this also comes to the changing notion of dating which she thinks is now seen as a game.

'Our idea of romance has changed from the traditional mind set we've had in the past,' she said.

'Many people see Tinder as a game and I think that while dating life has gone digital it too has turned into a game.'

Justin, 33, who works in finance and real estate development. He met Kirra for brunch. She says dates in America are 'very formalised'

Mike, a 26-year-old who works in finance, went for drinks with Kirra. She says a lot of her Tinder dates turned up to her art exhibition and were proud to be part of it

Andrew, a 32-year-old musician, who took Kirra out for dinner. She was very surprised by the open-mindedness of most of her dates

David, a 24-year-old law student, who had drinks with Kirra at a bar. She hope to further develop her project by interviewing her Tinder dates

Cheers says some subjects made it clear that they were uncomfortable with the idea of having their picture taken - some accusing of being a 'predator' or 'pervert' - but others were surprisingly open-minded.

Most even attended her exhibition in August - her first art exhibition in New York.

'I was really nervous because it was so personal and I was opening myself up to people,' she said.

'But I had such an overwhelming response from the 400 people who showed up and even my dates came by and were proud to be part of exhibition.' 

While she hopes to further develop her project and continue interviewing her subjects, Cheers has decided to take a break from the online dating scene after suffering from what she calls a 'Tinder hangover'.

'It was exhausting. I was totally burnt out emotionally and physically,' she said.

As for finding 'the one' - she hasn't quite achieved that through the project but says she is currently dating someone who met through - you guessed it - Tinder.
