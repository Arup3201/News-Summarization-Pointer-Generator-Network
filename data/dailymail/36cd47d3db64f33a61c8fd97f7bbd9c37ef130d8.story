A new father celebrating the birth of his son with a fry-up in a hospital canteen says his breakfast was served with a maggot.

Wayne Foster-Wells, 31, was at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, when he went for breakfast after visiting his wife, Tammy, following the birth of Samuel.

However, towards the end of his meal, the unemployed father-of-nine noticed the bug hiding in his tomatoes.

He said: 'It was your standard fry-up
with omelette, bacon, sausage and tomatoes, but towards the end of the 
meal I noticed a maggot on the plate.

'I
immediately told the other people eating the breakfast, but they 
carried on eating. I then spoke to the hospital staff but they didn't 
seem bothered.

'All they 
could say to me was that they would take my name and address but it 
could take multiple months before anything was done.

'But
I could get the £2.50 that I paid for the meal back. I have a really 
bad stomach and have been rushing to the toilet since.'

The Royal Gwent Hospital has launched 
an investigation and contacted the Environmental Health Office after 
Wayne made an official complaint.

Julian Hayman, of Aneurin Bevan Health Board, said: 'The health board can confirm that we have been made aware of a complaint from a member of the public.

'The complaint concerns tinned tomatoes which had been sourced externally.

'We are currently investigating the concern with our suppliers and have also informed the Environmental Health Office.'
