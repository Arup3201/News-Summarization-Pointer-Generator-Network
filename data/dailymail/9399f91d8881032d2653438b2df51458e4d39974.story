Dapper Laughs, the controversial persona supposedly 'killed off' by disgraced comedian Daniel O'Reilly, has been resurrected with the ominous message that his work 'isn't finished' yet.

In a YouTube video called 'Merry Christmas', the 'sexist' and 'offensive' character is depicted in 'heaven' before being summoned back to earth by God who said he was 'needed down there'.

He then confronts his creator, O'Reilly, who appears to be a simpering mess after his appearance on BBC2 current affairs show Newsnight last month when he declared 'Dapper Laughs is gone'.

O'Reilly asks: 'What are you doing here? You're supposed to be dead? I killed you off.'

Dapper Laughs, the controversial persona supposedly 'killed off' by disgraced comedian Daniel O'Reilly, has been resurrected in a new video

He then confronts his creator, O'Reilly, and says his work down here on earth 'ain't finished' yet

And his belligerent alter-ego responds saying: 'What killed me off was you coming on Newsnight, c***blocking yourself wearing that turtleneck, looking like a French poet.

'What's wrong, you can't take it? Go on, you might as well go up there (to heaven) because my work down here (on earth) ain't finished.'

More than 60,000 people signed a petition called for his ITV show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull to be cancelled after telling a female audience member she was 'gagging for a rape' at a show.

The TV watchdog launched an investigation into his show which promoted dubious dating 'advice’ to men including: “Remember, it’s only sexual harassment if she’s more attractive than you”. 

In the new video released on Christmas Day, O'Reilly says: 'You ended up taking over my life. You're going to ruffle some feathers. Why don't you tone it down a bit?

His controversial character then responds: 'Don't worry I'll keep it calm.'

He was seen at the start of the video apparently in heaven, lounging as he is fed grapes by a buxom angel as another strums a harp.

A voice presumed to belong to ‘God’ booms: “I’m sending you back to earth. You’re needed down there. O’Reilly has been crying his little b***s off.”

Dapper replies saying: “Leave it out, I’m having a quality time, I’ve got everything I need. Couple of Britney Spears, a few sweethearts, the occasional b****.'

When he appeared on Newsnight he admitted he had allowed himself to get 'carried away' with his own success after finding fame on social media. 

'It's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian. The bad press and everything that's happened - it's wrecked my life to a certain extent,' he said.

Wearing a black turtleneck and jacket, he mocked his  grovelling appearance on BBC Newsnight

When he appeared on Newsnight (pictured) in November he said he had allowed himself to get 'carried away' and declared that 'Dapper Laughs is gone'

'I am not going to allow Dapper Laughs to represent me. I want the people out there to know that not only am I going to stop it, I am going to help it not being promoted.'

In a live performance at Scala, London in October he was seen joking about rape, right after making an apology for his 'sexist' and 'offensive' comments about homeless people.

Referring to his ITV show and the controversy it had attracted, he was heard saying: 'If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go 'Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b***h, well done, see you later'.'

In the same show, he also told a female audience member that she was 'gagging for a rape'. 

Around 44 comedians  signed an open letter condemning O'Reilly for his 'sexist and degrading' comedy.
