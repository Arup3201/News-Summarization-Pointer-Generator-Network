One of the prostitutes accused of murdering a millionaire was one of his 'main girls' who was given $3,000 a month from him and knew the layout of the mansion in which he was robbed and killed, it was revealed today.

Katrina Fritz, 32, of Pittsburgh was receiving an allowance from Raveesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, a cell-phone entrepreneur and former owner of Mountain Winery in Saratoga, to help her buy her own home.

Kumra's body was found on November 30 at his 7,000 square-foot home in Monte Sereno. He was gagged with packaging tape and suffocated. His wife was beaten and told to 'be quiet if you want to live'.

The thieves made off with cash, jewelry and rare coins before his wife was able to call police.

Fritz was charged on Friday with murder and robbery after a letter was found on Kumra's computer saying he would pay $30,000 toward her new home.

Three other defendants were earlier charged with the same counts - Deangelo Austin, 21, Javier Garcia, 21 and Lukis Anderson, 26.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, phone records showed numerous calls between siblings Fritz and Austin, and placed Austin in the area of the victim's home at the time of the murder, police said.

Kumra frequently hired prostitutes and Fritz was known to be one of his 'main girls'.

Several prostitutes 'would have run of 
the house, able to go anywhere including (Kumra's wife's) room when she 
was not there', a witness told police.

Los Gatos police Detective Cpl Erin Lunsford wrote in documents filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court that Fritz had even visited Kumra's 
home with her children.

The 32-year-old had recently become angry at Kumra, however, as she had accused him of giving her an STD and also because he told her that he was 'running out of money and would not be able to pay for any child they might have together', Lunsford wrote.

Law enforcement officials 
told the San Francisco Chronicle that gang members Austin and Garcia 
joined forces to commit the robbery and murder after Dixon gave them a 
tip-off.

The same sources said that Austin is 
believed to be affiliated with the Money Team gang and that Garcia is 
thought to be associated with Ghost Town.

Dixon, 22, regarding the layout of the millionaire's home

This comes two weeks after it was claimed the millionaire businessman led a sordid life filled
with prostitutes, drink and drug problems, illegitimate children and a 
sham divorce, court papers revealed this week.

Raveesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, was found dead in his Monte Serlo, California, mansion on November 30
and though a prostitute and three men were arrested in connection with 
his death, police are remaining tight-lipped about the details, except 
to say it was not a random act of violence.

Volumes
of court files presented approximately two weeks ago to Santa Clara County's Sunnyvale 
courthouse painted Kurma as a ruthless businessman who lived a sordid 
and debauched lifestyle full of lies and deceit.

One email from a  former CEO of Kumra's Tesla Capital venture 
firm, to another former Tesla executive said: 'Ravi has never treated anyone fairly in
his life, except for his whores.'

It also detailed that his 2006 divorce from his wife Harinder was a sham in order to hide millions of dollars in assets, according to Mercury News.

Ravesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, a cell-phone entrepreneur and the former owner of Mountain Winery in Saratoga. His body was found after his wife summoned police to the couple's ransacked, 7,000-square-foot home in Monte Sereno, in the hills west of San Jose

The mansion: Kumra's ex-wife, Harinder was also home at their large villa in Monte Sereno and was tied up during the attack. She told police she believed three or four people had entered the family's mansion

Ravel Chanel Dixon, 22, a single mother and college student, was arrested last month for allegedly offering sex, drugs or money to an undercover cop. It was after her arrest she was linked to Kumra's murder.

The millionaire is best known for owning Mountain Winery in the 1990s. 

Kerry Harris, spokesman for the police 
department, said last month: 'We have not exhausted all investigative
leads at this time and until that happens, we can't be sure that we 
have all the suspects.

'At that point in time, we will be able to 
paint a more complete picture.'

At 1.30am on November 30, Harinder called police to the couple's gated Monte Sereno estate and said she had been beaten up and her husband tied up after four intruders broke in.

When police arrived they found Kumra dead. Harinder was taken to hospital for her injuries.

They have not said whether or not anything was stolen from the home during the break in.

Former CEO Stephen Kaffee said that before he died, Kumra told him that his divorce was 'on paper only', that he had an illegitimate child whose mother was trying to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from him and that he received a 90-day suspended jail sentence in the late 1990s due to his alcohol-fueled and violent behavior.

Kaffee wrote in a 2007 declaration filed
in the divorce proceedings: 'However successful Kumra may have once 
been in business, in my opinion his chronic abuse of alcohol, his 
chronic use of marijuana, his failure to address his health problems, 
and his immersion in a fantasy world of prostitutes and illegitimate 
children have left him without the interest or ability necessary.'

Charged in connection to homicide: The visibly frightened Dixon, of Alameda County, California, was charged with 'accessory after the fact' in the November 30 killing of 66-year-old millionaire investor Raveesh Kumra

When the couple divorced, the house, the 
furnishings, the Mercedes, a cellular phone company and the Tesla 
venture capital firm were signed over to his wife, which Kaffee believes was done to avoid a pending lawsuit involving Kankakee Cellular of Illinois stripping him of his millions.

The lawsuit accused Kumra of using funds from the Kankakee bank account 'to pay
for escort services, prostitutes, purchasing condominiums for his 
female companions and other personal expenses'.

He was supposed to have a management role in the firm but court papers said he 'performed virtually no services whatsoever'.

In return, Kurma accused Kaffee and another executive of trying to embezzle money from him.

The case was later dismissed.

Kumra was the first homicide victim in Mountain View, California, in 40 years.
