England's impressive 2-0 victory over Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier saw viewing figures return in the TV ratings stakes.

A brace from Arsenal's new signing Danny Welbeck not only restored the team's confidence, but also recaptured the nation's interest after last week's dull international friendly against Norway.

On that occasion, the BBC's Great British Bake Off programme attracted almost twice as many viewers, with an average figure of 8.3million compared to 4.5million for the game.

The reasons for the downfall in interest, which also saw only around 40,000 spectators travel to Wembley, was blamed on England's dismal performance at the World Cup where Roy Hodgson's side were eliminated after only two games.

However, the figures for the more meaningful fixture shown on ITV on Monday rose to an average of 5.6m - beating the 4.9million who watched the BBC series New Tricks.

Whether games against  England's remaining group E opponents, which include  Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia and San Marino, can retain fans' interest remains to be seen.
