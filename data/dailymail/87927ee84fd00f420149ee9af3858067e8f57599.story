Gareth Bale has been 'like a kid at Christmas' at training this week according to Zinedine Zidane ahead of Real Madrid's Champions League final against arch-rivals Atletico on Saturday.

Bale joined the nine-time European champions for a world record Â£86million from Premier League outfit Tottenham in September and is on the verge of achieving a dream double with his new side after having already won the Copa del Rey in April.

Excited: Zinedine Zidane says Gareth Bale is 'like a kid at Christmas' ahead of Real's Champions League Final

The 24-year-old Wales midfielder has impressed Real and France legend Zidane with his enthusiasm ahead of the Lisbon showpiece, at Benfica's Stadium of Light, at a time when the beautiful game is shrouded by money.

'So much talk of modern football is about wages, and contracts, and transfer fees - that the raw love of the game is forgotten,' he said.

'You only have to come and see Gareth (Bale) in training this week - and you will see just pure love for the game - he is like a child waiting for Christmas in the build up to the final. The entire club is excited - but Gareth is new to all this and the anticipation is big for him.'

Looking ahead to the all-Madrid final, Real coach Zidane added that the Bernabeu outfit are under no illusions of how difficult the task will be on Saturday as they look to win the much-fabled La Decima against the La Liga champions.

'It will be a tough game - anybody who has seen Atletico plays this season knows what a strong team they are,' he added.

'We are ready for the final though - and it is time to bring back European glory to this club.'
