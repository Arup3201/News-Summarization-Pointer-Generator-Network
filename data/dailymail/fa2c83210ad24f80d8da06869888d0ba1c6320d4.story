Two men have been arrested in connection with a New Year's Eve shooting that claimed three lives and left another person critically injured after police tracked them down using GPS.

Brothers Eric Donta Hendon, 31, and Michael Deon Hendon, 22, are accused by police of breaking into the Barberton, Ohio home and shooting two teenage siblings dead. The teens' father died Friday from his injuries, their stepmother remains hospitalized.

Ashley Carpenter, 18, and David Kohler-Carpenter, 14, were pronounced dead at the scene. Father John Kohler, 42, was taken off life support last week. Stepmother Ronda Blankenship, 38, remains hospitalized, according to the Akron Beacon Journal.

The elder Hendon is a registered violent sex offender out on parole, GPS surveillance placed him at the slain family's home at the time the shooting occurred, police told the paper.

Authorities charged each brother with
 three counts of aggravated murder during a Wednesday hearing which saw 
their bond set at $10million a piece, records showed.

A grand jury hearing set for next Thursday may see prosecutors ask for the death penalty, sources said told the Beacon Journal.

Eric
 Hendon was released from prison this past June after serving a 13-year 
sentence for shooting a woman in the vagina, according to the paper.

He
 was released into the custody of a halfway house under the terms of his
 supervised release requiring him to wear a GPS ankle bracelet.

That
 GPS device revealed the violent man was in the area of the home where 
the slayings occurred for roughly six minutes on New Year's Eve around 
the time investigators believe the victims died, the Beacon Journal 
reported.

A search of Eric Hendon's home found jeans with a red stain on the thigh, possibly blood, officials said.

Investigators believe the Hendon brothers targeted the home because Mr Kohler was a known marijuana dealer, according to an affidavit cited by the Beacon Journal.

The father of two had no previous arrested for drug trafficking, the paper noted.

Mr Kohler, 42, and girlfriend Ronda Blankenship, 38, were both injured in the attack and taken to a local hospital. Mr Kohler has since been taken off life support, Ms Blankenship is clinging to life, according to the Beacon Journal.

Miss Carpenter was a senior at Barberton High while her brother was in middle school.

Police told Ohio.com that at least two gunmen broke into the family's home around 7pm on December 31. Police responded following a 911 call from an anonymous source.

Officer Marty Eberhart said that he 
believed to motive to be robbery but would not reveal further details 
but that authorities had leads to who was behind the slayings. 

The children’s mother, Leiha Carpenter, lives in town.

Tim Terry and Michelle Olei, who live 
next door, told ohio.com: 'I had my video game going. I didn’t hear 
anything. I think it was something personal.'
