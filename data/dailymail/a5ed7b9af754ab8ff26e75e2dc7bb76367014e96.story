Police have condemned drunk students who brought Newcastle city centre to a standstill for 10 minutes by singing a cult football chant.

On a night out after England qualified for the World Cup, dozens of youngsters spilled on to the streets at 3am to sing Manchester City's famous chant about Yaya Toure and his brother Kolo.

Drivers furiously beeped their horns as the drinkers sang loudly and enjoyed themselves.

Dangerous: Police have criticised the youngsters' 'rowdy' behaviour, claiming it could have resulted in injuries

Now, Northumbria Police have criticised the youngsters for their antics - claiming the 'rowdy' behaviour could have resulted in injuries.

'This type of 
drunken and disorderly behaviour will not be tolerated by police in 
Newcastle city centre,' central neighbourhood inspector Caroline Ord told the BBC.

'We want young people to come into the city centre and have a good time but they must behave responsibly.'

The chant, which is well-known among supporters of the Manchester club, is sung to the tune of 2 Unlimited's smash hit, 'No Limit', which topped the UK charts in 1993.

And it's not just Pellegrini's club 
who chant to the song released by the Dutch group 20 years ago - Everton
and Liverpool have their own versions of it too.

The blue half of the Merseyside sing about defender Tony Hibbert to the tune of
'No Limit', while the red side chant the song about their former
midfielder Momo Sissoko.

City fan Joe Friar, 20, told the Manchester Evening News: 'One of my flatmates is a Chelsea fan and he loves the Yaya/Kolo Toure chant and the actions after seeing me do it.

'We came out of a club and he started doing it in the middle of the road for some reason.

Pleased: Yaya tweeted the video to his followers, adding: 'Thank you for the dedication from Newcastle lol!'

'I'd
had a few so I joined in, being a Blue, and then loads of other people 
who were coming out of clubs started doing it as well and it seemed to 
catch on. It's pretty easy to pick up.

'It ended up going on for about 10 minutes - it was bizarre.'

Toure
himself has shown his support for the Newcastle students by tweeting the video.

He tweeted: 'Thank you for the dedication from 
Newcastle lol! It will take me to get to the kolo dance yaya.'
