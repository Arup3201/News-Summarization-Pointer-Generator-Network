Cleveland Browns player Johnny Manziel is at it again.

The quarterback - whose off-the-field partying ways have earned him a 'bad boy' reputation - was caught giving the middle finger while playing the Washington Redskins.

Manziel - aka 'Johnny Football' - was filmed running and making the obscene gesture during the game's third quarter on Monday.

Speaking about his behavior, Manziel told ESPN 'I get words exchanged with me. I should have been smarter. It's Monday Night Football. I had a lapse of judgement.'

Cleveland Browns coach Mike Pettine told the sports network, 'It did not sit well. I was informed of it after the game and it's disappointing. Because what we talk about it being poised and being focused - that you have to be able to maintain your poise.'

ESPN said 'Manziel may have heard something from the [Redskins] bench' following an incomplete pass.

Manziel was mocked elsewhere in the game - in the first quarter Redskins linebacker Brian Orakpo raised both hands and performed the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner's 'money' gesture after a sack by teammate Ryan Kerrigan.

Manziel struggled to hit open receivers, while Brian Hoyer completed only two passes in five series.

The Cleveland Browns lost 24-23.

Pettine has not yet announced which player will be the Browns' starting quarterback this season. Pettine has said he plans to announce his regular season starter Tuesday.

Over the past few months, Manziel has also been in the headlines for his Instagram account, which includes multiple photos of him hanging out with celebrities and athletes - including Drake, Kevin Durant, Justin Bieber and Arian Houston, to name a few.

Several photos on his account show his 'girlfriend' Colleen Crowley. Manziel refers to Crowley in several photo captions as 'bae.'

A photo uploaded last week shows Crowley kissing a window, with Manziel's face on a giant screen in the background.

The photo was captioned 'Mine.'

A photo leaked this summer showed Manziel rolling a dollar bill in a bathroom - leading many to question what the money was being used for

Manziel has also been captured in multiple photos partying. Earlier this summer, a photo leaked showing him holding a rolled-up dollar bill in a bathroom.

In February, Manziel told The Houston Chronicle 'Johnny Football is the stuff you see on TMZ. There's part of that folk tale that goes along with it and tries to twist me into somebody I'm not all the time. I feel like now there's kind of like this frozen food package - a prewrapped, precooked package of who I am.

'Johnny Manziel is the guy that - whether it's Houston, Jacksonville, Cleveland or Oakland - you'll have to drag off that field before I stop playing for those guys. Those are my teammates. Those are my brothers from now on. I'm going to fight until there's no time left on the clock. That's Johnny Manziel.'

Good times: Manziel, in a gray T-shirt, was seen in June hanging out with bikini-clad women
