Former North Korean leader's eldest son has said the new regime will 'not last long' under the rule of his half brother.

Kim Jong Nam described the succession of power to Kim Jong Un as 'a joke to the outside world' in an email published yesterday by South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper.

And he said his half brother would be 'just a nominal figure', adding: 'The members of the power elite will be the ones in actual power.'

'A joke': Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Il's eldest son, claims his half brother will not last long in power in North Korea

Kim Jong Un was only announced as Kim Jong Il's successor in September 2010 and he was thrust into leadership with the 'great leader' died last month.

The 27-year-old has little experience of leadership or dealing with alliance-making necessary to holding on to power in the notoriously reclusive state.

'Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse,' the newspaper quoted Kim Jong Nam as saying.

'The Kim Jong Un regime will not last long.'

North Koreans have been told their new leader studied at Kim Il Sung Military University and was involved in military operations including the November 2010 artillery attack on a South Korean island that saw four people killed.

He is seen as most like his father in manner and personality - crucial for the personality cult which is used to suppress opposition.

Kim Jong Nam, aged around 40, is known for his playboy lifestyle and love of casinos.

He is believed to have fallen out of favour with his father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in 2001, claiming he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.

He told the newspaper: 'Because I was educated in the West, I was able to enjoy freedom from early age, and I still love being free.

Rise to prominence: Despite being relatively unknown 15 months ago, Kim Jong Un was appointed a four-star general and an vice chairman in the North Korean communist party

Cult of personality: Since he took over as leader of North Korea, the country's military has been keen to play down his lack of experience with bombastic displays like this one in Pyongyang

The Associated Press has become the first international news organisation to establish a full-time presence in North Korea.

In a ceremony a month after the death of long-time ruler Kim Jong Il, AP president and chief executive Tom Curley inaugurated a new office inside the headquarters of the state-run Korean Central News Agency in Pyongyang.

The bureau expands the agency's presence in North Korea, following a breakthrough in 2006 when it opened a video office in the capital.

Exclusive video from AP was used by media outlets around the world following Kim Jong Il's death.

It marks an important gesture after decades of being off-limits to international journalists.

AP, an independent 165-year-old news cooperative founded in New York, has operations in more than 100 countries and employs nearly 2,500 journalists.

Mr Curley said: 'Beyond this door lies a path to vastly larger understanding and cultural enrichment for millions around the world.

'Regardless of whether you were born in Pyonyang or Pennsylvania, you are aware of the bridge being created today.'

'The reason I visit Macau so often is because it's the most free and liberal place near China, where my family lives.'

The South Korean newspaper said a Japanese journalist, Yoji Komi, exchanged almost 100 emails with Kim Jong Nam between 2004 and December last year.

It comes as a senior North Korean party official dismissed concerns about Kim Jong Un's readiness to lead.

Politburo member and family confidante Yang Hyong Sop said the country's people were in good hands with their new leader.

He said: 'We suffered the greatest loss in the history of our nation as a result of the sudden, unexpected and tragic loss of the great leader Kim Jong Il.

'But still, we are not worried a bit, 
because we know that we are being led by comrade Kim Jong Un, who is 
fully prepared to carry on the heritage created by the great General Kim
Jong Il.'

White mourning 
bouquets and massive portraits of the deceased leader have been cleared 
from capital Pyongyang's main buildings and monuments.

After
Kim Jong Il's death, streets and squares in Pyongyang were filled with 
hysterical people weeping and crying out in apparent anguish.

His son's rapid ascension to power has
raised questions about how ready he is to inherit rule over the 
24million population with a nuclear programme as well as chronic trouble
feeding all its people.

Mr 
Yang added: 'It's not a secret that he has helped the great general in 
many different aspects - not only in military affairs but also the 
economy and other areas as well.'
