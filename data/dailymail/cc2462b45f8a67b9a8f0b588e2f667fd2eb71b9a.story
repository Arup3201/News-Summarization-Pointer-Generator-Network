Homes were flooded with muddy water last night after a mains pipe burst, spewing filth down a main road in London.

Clapham Road in Kennington, south London had four inches of water mixed with mud and silt running down it, with firefighters forced to lay sandbags in a bid to prevent excess damage to local homes.

The road - where the average house price is more than Â£800,000 - was closed this morning as engineers rushed to clean up the damage, bringing travel chaos to the area as commuters had to find alternative ways to get to work.

Clean-up: The road was shut off this morning as Thames Water worked to repair the damage

Drastic: Local residents had to leap over filthy rivulets to get out of their homes today

Gushing: The pressurised pipe flooded the street with muddy water which was standing four inches deep

There were initial reports that a sewage pipe had sprung a leak, causing a torrent of excrement to cascade down the road.

One
 policeman at the scene described it as 'stinky sewage', while another 
said it was 'contaminated' and a 'hazard to health' and eyewitnesses 
described the water seeping into basement flats.

But
 a Thames Water spokesman later said the flood was a result of a burst 
water main, which had broken the surface of the road and mixed with silt
 and mud. 

Officials said that one basement flat had been flooded by the filthy water, while residents and emergency workers laid sandbags along other properties to keep out the four-inch-deep torrent.

The street - a major artery leading 
from the popular residential area of Clapham into central London - is 
closed indefinitely while engineers work to clean up the mud and repair 
the damaged surface.

Destruction: The surface of the road was broken by the extreme force of the water gushing from the pipe

Quiet: The road was closed this morning, causing major disruption for commuters in the morning rush hour

Emergency: Water workers rushed to the scene this morning to fix the leak

Inspection: Workers attempted to clear the sludge from the road and fix the problem

Long queues were reported in the area during the morning rush hour as commuters sought to avoid the road.

Transport for London said that it would not know when the street will be able to re-open until it has received a report from Thames Water.

A spokesman for the water company said: 
'The A3 Clapham Road in Kennington, south London, was flooded after a 
high-pressured 30-inch Thames Water main leaked across the carriageway 
at around 8.30pm.

'The 
London red route remains closed both ways between Oval Station and 
Caldwell Street while engineers work to inspect and then repair the 
damage, although the flooding has not affected the Underground station.

'Thames
 Water will now be working with the police and local authorities to 
closely inspect the damage and carry out what is expected to be a 
complicated repair, with other utility pipes in the close vicinity of 
the broken main.'

Fury: Arthur Fitzpatrick was one of residents of Clapham Road who was affected by the deluge

Filth: Cyclists braved the muck which was coating the road as they battled to get to work

Works: A digger was involved in the clean-up which will require repairing parts of the road

Jason 
Aldred, head of Thames Water's networks, added: 'By midnight, our 
teams had shut off the water supply to the broken pipe and water 
supplies had been restored to the vast majority of affected customers in
 the area.

'The focus of
 the team now is to fix this broken clean water pipe, which has nothing 
to do with our wastewater network, as soon as possible and start getting
 the road back to normal. We're really sorry to anyone who has been 
affected.'

Resident
 Lewis Whyld, who posted footage of the incident online, wrote on Twitter: 'People now 
getting trapped by sewage in south London, firefighters evacuating 
properties.'

In 
another post, he added: 'Expect lower ground floor flats to be full of 
sewage in south London tonight, it's getting deeper too.'

Angela
 Reynolds, 58, said: 'The road has been made into a river. It's a bit 
like Somerset. It's not clear how they are going to stop it. The water 
is revolting, brown, muddy - well I hope it's mud.

'There
 are lots of basements around here. One of the houses has already been 
badly flooded. The water just flooded the road in 10 minutes. It was 
quite incredible.'

Marcus Eyskens, 24, who was among the 
onlookers in Clapham Road, said: 'It's blocked all the road. It's a lot 
of water. It'll probably take a few days to get it under control.'

Several fire engines, police cars and 
an ambulance attended the scene near Oval Tube station, while a London 
Underground Emergency Response Unit were also deployed.

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: 'Four fire engines and around 20 firefighters were called to deal with a burst water main near the junction of Clapham Road and Claylands Rd in Stockwell, SW9 yesterday evening.

At the height of the incident the roadway was flooded to a depth of about four inches after the 30-inch water main burst.

Crews pumped water away from one flooded basement flat but no other homes are believed to have been affected. Sandbags were used as a precaution to protect properties from the water.'
