Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has vowed to protect British soldiers if the Conservatives win the General Election

British soldiers will be protected from ‘ambulance-chasing’ lawyers if the Conservatives win the General Election, the Defence Secretary pledged last night.

Human rights laws will be ‘ripped up’ to ensure those who fight for their country can no longer be hounded in the courts, Michael Fallon said.

He promised to end ‘abuse’ of the Human Rights Act by law firms and so-called victims, who he said were lodging claims on an ‘industrial scale’.

Such claims were costing the taxpayer millions of pounds and undermining the vital work of the military, Mr Fallon warned.

The Tories will confirm their commitment to diminish the UK’s membership of the European Convention on Human Rights in their manifesto. As part of this, the Human Rights Act will be scrapped and soldiers will be subject to a new British Bill of Rights which will reflect the pressures they face in combat.

Mr Fallon said: ‘This abuse has got to stop and the next Tory government will limit the reach of human rights cases to the UK so our forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights claims.’

Figures yesterday showed legal claims over incidents involving British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan have already cost the taxpayer nearly £90million over the last ten years – a figure expected to soar even further.

Many of the so-called ‘victims’ of these incidents have used the ECHR to demand millions of pounds in compensation. Two public inquiries alone have cost the Ministry of Defence £55.9million.

The Al Sweady Inquiry looked into claims lodged by two legal-aid-funded firms – Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day – that British troops murdered, mutilated and tortured Iraqi detainees.

After an inquiry costing £31million, the allegations were found to be ‘wholly and entirely without merit or justification’. Despite this, the law firms are continuing to pursue cases against the MoD for deaths in Iraq using the Human Rights Act.

If the rules are not changed, top brass fear being bombarded by 2,230 more legal claims. There are concerns that troops will in future have to call a lawyer before taking action – even in the heat of a battle.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said yesterday: ‘We can’t go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws … I made it clear last year that I want to rip up Labour’s Human Rights Act and that it is only the Conservatives who will make real changes to the human rights framework to restore some common sense.’

Rules governing conflict would fall under the Geneva Convention, which allows lethal force as a first resort against enemy combatants.

Last night former military chiefs welcomed the move. Colonel Tim Collins, served in the Iraq War, said: ‘It is about time this happened. To [some] lawyers … the Iraqis are only a vehicle for profit. It is a shameless racket and must be stopped for everyone’s dignity.’

Soldier Kevin Williams, who was repeatedly hounded by lawyers over the death of an Iraqi man, said: ‘To hear the Tories are going to support soldiers is a relief.’

The 32-year-old, who shot Hassan Abbas Said in a violent struggle in 2003, was cleared by two military investigations only then to face a murder charge – but was once again cleared. He was served with a letter last year hauling him before a new probe into Iraqi deaths as part of the Iraq Fatality Investigations, brought about to comply with Article 2 of the Human Rights Act.

The court martial of seven paratroopers accused of murdering an Iraqi teenager collapsed in 2005 after the judge branded some Iraqi witnesses as seekers of ‘blood money’.

They were hauled before new investigators as part of the Iraq Fatality Investigations and faced fresh scrutiny over their roles last year. The investigations were brought in order to ‘fulfil the investigation duties of the State’, in accordance with Article 2 of the Human Rights Act.

The 33-year-old Scot, who shot an Iraqi civilian at a checkpoint in Basra 11 years ago, had his case dropped in 2005.

Now the Iraq Historic Allegations Team – set up to comply with the Human Rights Act – have told him they are investigating the shooting as part of their investigations into alleged war crimes in Iraq and he was told he could face charges.

The family making the case are represented by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers.
