McDonald's own help hotline has admitted its workers are paid so poorly they'll have 'no problem' qualifying for government assistance such as food stamps.

Chicago mother-of-two and 10-year McDonald's veteran Nancy Salgado made a call to 'McResource' recently, asking for help paying her heating bill, feeding her children and getting her sister medical assistance.

Instead of discussing a raise - Salgado has been on $8.25 an hour for a decade - or offering health cover, the representative said Salgado, a full-time employee, 'definitely should be able to qualify for both food stamps and heating assistance.'

Advocacy group Low Pay Is Not OK recorded the phone call and circulated an edited version to flag up how many full-time fast-food workers are living in poverty - and McDonald's doesn't seem to care.

McDonald's told CNN Money the video was 'not an accurate portrayal of the resource line' because it was 'very obviously' edited.

However, CNNMoney reviewed the full recording of the call and reported that the helpline operator never asked Salgado how much she made per hour, and how many hours per week - though she knew she was full-time - she worked before recommending the government programs.

The representative pointed her toward a number of resources in Chicago, such as food pantries and a program that would help cover some of her heating bill and said she would email her specific phone numbers and programs.

McDonald's told CNN that 'the McResource Line is intended to be a free, confidential service to help employees and their families get answers to a variety of questions or provide resources on a variety of topics including housing, child care, transportation, grief, elder care, education and more.'

But according to the network, the hotline is not open to all McDonald's workers as franchise owners need to pay for the service in order for their employees to access it.

The clearly dedicated operator said: 'We can be a good program. We can do a lot of the leg work that takes a lot of the stresses off of you making a million phone calls trying to find services.'

News of Salgado's experience comes a week after a report found that more than half of fast food workers have to rely on public assistance programs because their wages aren't enough to support them.

The report estimated that this public aid carries a $7 billion price tag for taxpayers each year.

A separate report by the National Employment Law Project released on the same day showed that McDonald's alone was responsible for $1.2 billion of that $7 billion alone.

Since last November, workers have been protesting their low pay in cities including New York City, Los Angeles, Memphis and Detroit. They are demanding a minimum wage of $15 an hour and the right to demonstrate without retaliation.

On October 9, Salgado was arrested after she confronted the company president at a meeting and told him she couldnâ€™t afford to buy shoes or food for her children.

She told The Real News that she felt like she had to speak out during McDonald's USA President Jeff Strattonâ€™s speech at the Union League Club of Chicago on Friday for the sake of her children.

'It's really hard for me to feed my two kids and struggle day to day,' she shouted as Stratton was speaking. 'Do you think this is fair, that I have to be making $8.25 when Iâ€™ve worked for McDonald's for 10 years?'

He responded: 'I've been there for forty years.'
