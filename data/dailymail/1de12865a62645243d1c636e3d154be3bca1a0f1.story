Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi - more commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India.

Employing non-violent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for non-violence, civil rights and freedom across the world.

The son of a senior government official, Gandhi was born in October 1869 and raised in a Bania community in coastal Gujarat, before training in law in London.

He assumed leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 and led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, increasing economic self-reliance, and above all for achieving Swaraj—the independence of India from British domination.

He was assassinated on 30 January 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought Gandhi was too sympathetic to India's Muslims.

'They are not in the best condition, but that doesn’t really matter to serious collectors.

'We have grown a reputation for selling items of Indian origin in recent years, and buyers come from around the world.

'Items that belonged to Gandhi are accorded great significance and status by many people in India and beyond.

'They are treated often has holy relics and the market is growing, particularly in the US, as well as in India.

'Other items in the sale in include many photographs and even his prayer beads.

'Among the photographs is one showing him in a smart suit and carrying a hat from when he worked in the legal profession - as far removed from his usual image as it is possible to get.'

Not only are the sandals part of the famous image of the Gandhi, along with his spectacles and loin cloth, but they have spawned a phrase.

‘Gandhi’s flip-flop’ entered the lexicon to describe a dry mouth the night after drinking heavily.

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi - known as Mahatma Gandhi - was the leader of Indian nationalism and was famous for using non-violent civil disobedience.

He lived modestly and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha.

Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought he was too sympathetic to India’s Muslims.

The auction takes place on May 21.
