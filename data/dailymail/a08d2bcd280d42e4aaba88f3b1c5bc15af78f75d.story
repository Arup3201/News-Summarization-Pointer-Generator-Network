Controversial: A leaked e-mail from Peter Horrocks, pictured, has asked staff to come up with money-making schemes

The BBC has told its own journalists they must come up with ideas to make the corporation more money, a leaked e-mail has revealed.

Management are insisting its 2,400 staff at BBC Worldwide devise cash-generating schemes to present at their staff appraisals, calling into question its future editorial independence.

With the BBC already making redundancies and budget cuts, journalists have been told they must: 'exploit new commercial opportunities (and) maximise the value we create with our journalism.'

Critics fear that this could lead to them ignoring important stories across the globe in favour of ones that will bring in extra cash.

It came as the corporation is being investigated by media watchdog Ofcom, who are looking into how some BBC World News programmes became 'commercially influenced'.

BBC bosses have already apologised for these mistakes.

Peter Horrocks, the director of BBC Global News, told his journalists that their official appraisals will include an objective section on their ability to generate cash.

His leaked e-mail to The Independent says: 'With the income objective, let us know if you have any ideas on how we can strengthen our commercial focus and grow income. 

'No matter where you work, you can help meet these objectives. They have been designed to encompass all departments, using strengths and expertise of all members of staff.

'Please use these objectives during your appraisal to talk through with your line manager what these objectives mean to you as an individual and your role in the fulfilment of them.'

The move has been branded 'appalling' by former BBC staff and union leaders, who say the BBC's editorial independence could be compromised, especially in areas like China and India.

Regrettable move: Former correspondent and MP Martin Bell says the BBC is not a money-making organisation

BBC World already sells adverts on its TV channel as well as on BBC.com, an international version of its news website.

Former war reporter and MP Martin Bell told the Independent: 'The BBC is not a money-making organisation. It is mostly a money-spending organisation. I find this a regrettable move.'

John Tusa, who was managing director of the World Service for seven years, said to the paper: 'The notion that as a journalist you are having to think about how you can sell or turn your output into money is just so wide of the mark. If he [Horrocks] pushes it too far he can start to undermine the values of trust on which the BBC World Service news has existed for 80-odd years. It sounds like management gobbledy-gook.'

Anger: Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi visits the BBC World Service last week, but people fear a move towards commercialism could compromise its output

Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), added it was a 'shocking development' that threatened the 'ethos at the heart of public service broadcasting.'

The BBC today denied to MailOnline that the plans would compromise its integrity.

'It is not true that the BBC's international journalists are being 'ordered to make money,' a spokesman said.

'The job of the BBC's journalists will always remain providing impartial, independent news and there are no specific commercial targets for frontline journalists.

'The BBC’s public service mission to provide impartial and independent news will always takes precedence over wider commercial goals and nothing in this email suggests any different.

'The BBC's international news services such as BBC World News and BBC.com already have a long tradition of generating commercial income to reinvest in independent public service journalism and these objectives simply aimed to reflect that.'
