For families seeking a cheap break abroad, British Airways’ offer ‘to summer in Europe’ from £39 one way seemed a real bargain.

Until, that is, you read the small print which revealed that BA’s definition of ‘summer’ ran from September to December.

Even then, the autumn half-term school holiday period is specifically excluded. And it’s for ‘hand-baggage’ passengers only.

One colour ad for the cheap flights from Gatwick features a large picture of a man - or at least his bare legs in swimming trunks - relaxing in a sunny setting by a vast and inviting expanse of sea

BA has now apologised for the adverts and pledged not to run them again.

One colour ad for the cheap flights from Gatwick features a large picture of a man – or at least his bare legs in swimming trunks – relaxing in a sunny setting by a vast and inviting expanse of sea.

But close investigation of the small print at the bottom reveals that the £39 ‘summer’ deals are limited to flights to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Nice and Malaga from September 8 to December 14.

Bob Atkinson of TravelSupermarket.com said: ‘It would appear BA are creating a new definition of the word summer.’

A BA spokesman said: ‘We are sorry if some customers may have felt misled.'
