New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that undergoing a weight-loss surgery just over a year ago was a 'life-changing decision.'

Appearing on his monthly TownSquare Media radio show Wednesday night, Christie said he works out four days a week and has achieved better health.

The 51-year-old governor has not revealed how many pounds he's shed so far, but he has become noticeably slimmer since secretly undergoing the stomach banding surgery last February.

Then and now: It is estimated that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (pictured left in August 2012) has shed close to 100lbs (pictured Tuesday) since undergoing a Lap-Band surgery last February

Progress: The 51-year-old Republican said he works out four days a week and has achieved better health

He said he enjoys riding a stationary bike but does not like doing side-lift exercises with dumbbells.

The possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate has said he's struggled with being overweight his entire adult life.

According to a medical report released by Christie’s doctors last October, the governor has been struggling with high blood pressure and asthma, but was otherwise in good health. 

Nowadays, everywhere Mr Christie goes, he is showered with compliments on his trimmer figure from his constituents.

‘He looks amazing! He looks very healthy and happy and vibrant,’ Shannon Ruvelas told NJ.com said after a recent town hall meeting in Berkeley Township. ‘I’m expecting he’ll continue to look better.’

In response, the Republican governor usually smiles and says that he 'feels great.'

Looking good: Christie, who is estimated to have shed around 100lbs so far, is getting compliments from constituents wherever he goes

While the usually outspoken Christie has kept mum about his goal weight, experts said he has lost 100lbs since last year.

The 5-foot-11 politician underwent Lap-Band surgery in February 2013 and has since slimmed down to an estimated 320lbs.

Amid speculations that the portly Mr Christie went under the knife with an eye to a potential presidential run in 2016, the government has maintained that his sole objective was to lead a healthier lifestyle.

During yesterday's TownSquare Media radio show, Christie said he has not ruled out throwing his hat into the ring two years from now despite his aides' involvement in a traffic-blocking plot that has engulfed his administration.

Still a contender: Christie said he has not ruled out running for president in 2016 despite the politically damaging Bridge-gate scandal involving his aides

He said that nothing that has happened 'would make me think any differently about my ability to pursue that job or to perform in it.'

The 51-year-old was considered an early front-runner for the Republican nomination, but his ranking has slipped since the Bridge-gate scandal broke.

Mr Christie insisted he did not know about the political payback plot orchestrated by his aides, who blocked traffic near the George Washington Bridge apparently to punish a Democratic adversary.
