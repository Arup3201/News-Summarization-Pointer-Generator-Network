The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.'s new genetically modified potato - thought business partner McDonald's has not.

The fast-food giant said it doesn't use genetically modified potatoes, The Idaho Statesman reported on Saturday.

'McDonald's USA does not source GMO potatoes, nor do we have current plans to change our sourcing practices,' the company said in a statement.

Ready to go: The USDA this month gave Boise-based Simplot permission to begin commercial planting of its new spud, called the 'Innate' potato

The USDA this month gave Boise-based Simplot permission to begin commercial planting of its new spud, called the 'Innate' potato, the newspaper reported.

According to The Idaho Statesman, the company altered the potato's DNA so it produces less acrylamide, which is suspected to be a human carcinogen. Potatoes naturally produce the chemical when they're cooked at high temperatures.

The potato is also engineered to resist bruising.

Simplot is a major supplier of french fries, hash browns and other potato products for restaurant chains like McDonald's.

A GMO from Monsanto stopped being produced when it suffered poor sales in a separate, earlier case after it failed to be accepted by both the fast-food industry and buyers, The Idaho Statesman reported.

Doug Cole, a spokesman for Simplot, told the newspaper that Innate would be accepted by the fresh potato market.

The newspaper reported that Cole also claimed consumers are going to respond to both lower possible carcinogens and sugars.

The Idaho Statesman reported 'Because only 400 test acres of Innate varieties were planted and harvested this fall, production can't ramp up until after the 2015 harvest, [Cole] said.'

Dehydrated potato industry buyers have said to potato grower Duane Grant that he shouldn't plant Innate potatoes, Grant told the newspaper.

However, he told the newspaper he wants to find people to buy the Innate potatoes from him. He told the newspaper this is because he wants to plant Innate potatoes, which have less bruising - linking them to increased crop production.

The Idaho Statesman reported 'Consumers will be more receptive to Simplot's potato than Monsanto's because it benefits them, not just growers, [Grant] said.'

Grant told the newspaper that getting the food industry behind the Innate potato is the essential point for both Simplot and potato growers.

'Brand equity is extremely important to quick-serve restaurants,' he told The Idaho Statesman. 'They will avoid conflict whenever possible in order to protect equity of their brand name.'
