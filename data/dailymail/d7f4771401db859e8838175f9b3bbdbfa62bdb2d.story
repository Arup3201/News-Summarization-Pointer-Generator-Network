Benjamin Herman, pictured today, has been charged with indecent assault on a young girl

A former Royal aide has been charged with indecent assault on a young girl while working at Buckingham Palace – after the alleged victim came forward in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Benjamin Herman, 79, who was seconded from the Royal Marines as an aide to Prince Philip and Princess Anne in the early 70s, is accused of sexually assaulting a girl aged about 12 while working for the Royal family.

The retired Lieutenant-Colonel has been charged with three counts of indecent assault and one of attempted assault on the girl between 1972 and 1974.

It was 
reported last night that detectives had examined Prince Philip’s 
official diaries covering the period from January 1972 to January 1974.

It
 is not known if police have interviewed the Prince or other members of 
the Royal Family, but they are believed to have taken statements from 
former Palace staff.

The
 former Royal Marine told the Daily Mirror he intended to fight the 
allegations. Asked if he would deny the charges, he replied: ‘Of 
course’.

The alleged victim, now in her 50s, came forward in the wake of the Savile child abuse scandal. 

Lt
 Col Herman worked as Princess Anne’s private secretary for two years 
before returning to the Marines. He was her first private secretary and 
had formerly been Equerry-in-waiting to Prince Philip.

Scotland
 Yard confirmed last night: ‘A man of 79 was arrested on February 28 
this year. CID in Wandsworth were investigating allegations of historic 
sexual assaults between 1972 and 1974.’ 

Lt Col Herman, a grandfather, is due to appear before Wimbledon magistrates in South London on Monday.

During his career he served with 40 Commando Royal Marines, and was made Military Assistant and Aide-de-Camp to the Commandant General Royal Marines.

At the time of the alleged offences he lived at Windsor, Berkshire, but was also based at Wellington Barracks, near the Palace.

A
 spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said that Lt Col Herman 
would appear at Wimbledon Magistrates on Monday, charged with three 
counts of indecent assault and one attempted assault on a girl aged 
around 12 between 1972 and 1974.

Last night the Palace declined to comment.
