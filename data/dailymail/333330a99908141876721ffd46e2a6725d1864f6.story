Cancer-stricken Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's is not expected to live more than six months, according to a former U.S. ambassador.

Roger Noriega, former U.S. ambassador to the Organisation of American States, said the disease could kill him before the presidential elections in October next year.

He said U.S. officials believe it is unlikely he would stand as a candidate in the close run race for control of South America's biggest oil exporter, according to the Miami Herald.

Formerly the leader of the fifth Republic Movement Chávez has held the position of president since 1999.

Writing in a column called 'Hugo
Chávez’s Big Lie and Washington’s Apathy' published on Inter-American 
Security Watch, Noriega said information and documents from the 
Venezuelan government which he had seen suggest his cancer is 
spreading faster than expected.

He said: 'The international team of doctors in charge of treating Hugo Chávez’s cancer does not expect him to live more than six months'.

He added: 'His physical deterioration is 
speeding more rapidly than his doctors had predicted and, despite this 
serious situation, Chávez has insisted on receiving low doses of 
chemotherapy to avoid long absences from the political scene during this
fragile period.'

Noriega said doctors think the decision not to increase the dose of chemotherapy so he can continue work is very dangerous for his health.

He wrote leaders within the regime were now worried about how they were going to explain the 'big lie' to the public, who have been lead to believe their president is 'healed'.

In September Chavez denied rumours of a setback to his health claiming he was expecting to complete his cancer treatment.

He
called state television and urged Venezuelans to 'pay no attention to 
rumors' which were circulating about him having kidney failure.

'I'm fine,' Chavez said. 'I'm here in my place of work and working.'

He said he was taking steroids and other medicine to recover from chemotherapy and said he was working at 'half throttle'.

He underwent surgery in June to remove a tumour from his pelvic region.

Critics of Chavez have accused him of giving slow, incomplete reports on his illness that have fed rumors.

Following his socialist ideology, Chavez has focused on implementing socialist reforms in the country.

In
the early 1980s he founded the secretive Revolutionary Bolivarian 
Movement-200 (MBR-200) after becoming disillusioned with the Venezuelan 
political system which he viewed as corrupt and undemocratic.

He was imprisoned after leading the group in an unsuccessful coup d'état against the government in 1992.

On his release two years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement, and was elected president of Venezuela.

He
has proved a controversial and divisive figure and his influence in 
Latin America led Time magazine to include him among their list of the 
world's 100 most influential people in both 2005 and 2006.
