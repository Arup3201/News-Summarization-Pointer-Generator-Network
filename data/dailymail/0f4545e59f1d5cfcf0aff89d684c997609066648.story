A woman who appeared on TV claiming that no one would give her a job because she was too fat was caught shoplifting cakes just hours later, it emerged today.

Jay Cole was interviewed on ITV's This Morning last month, complaining that employers discriminated against her because she is 22st.

But later that same day, she was caught stealing baked goods, champagne and deodorant from her local branch of Sainsbury's.

Police apparently recognised her on CCTV footage after watching her TV appearance earlier in the day.

Arrested: Jay Cole has been given a caution for stealing food from a supermarket after appearing on TV to complain she was too fat to find work

Cole, 24, told presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that she had never had a full-time job because of her size.

The single mother, from Tonbridge in Kent, complained: 'I have gone for everything. Cleaning jobs, retail, nursery nurse. But when I go to interviews you can see the disappointment automatically.

'They think that fat people are lazy and not capable and cannot do what normal sized people can do.'

Former Apprentice host Katie Hopkins also appeared on the programme, and told Cole: 'I would never employ somebody of your size.'

Soon after the broadcast on February 27, Cole visited a branch of Sainsbury's near her council house and stole £42 worth of food and other products.

She was later arrested given a police caution for the theft, as well as for another shoplifting incident earlier in the month which saw her steal around £20 worth of goods.

A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'A 24 year-old woman accepted a police caution following two reports of theft from Sainsbury's in Tonbridge on 19 February and 27 February.

'Items reported stolen included bakery items, energy drinks, champagne and deodorant. The woman was arrested on 1 March.'

Shoplifting: Among the goods stolen by Cole were pastries, cakes, champagne and deodorant

Despite claiming she is regularly applying for jobs, Cole has only attended 12 interviews in five years, but insists she is keen to get off benefits.

She has been given a two-bedroom council flat and has her council tax paid, claiming a total of £227 a week in benefits.

Cole's benefits allow her to get clothing vouchers for job interviews, free prescriptions and discounted Tube travel.
