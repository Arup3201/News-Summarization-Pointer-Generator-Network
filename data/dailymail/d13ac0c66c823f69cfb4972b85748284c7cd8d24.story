At least 45 people have been killed and 26 others wounded after gunmen disguised as traders stormed a weekly market in northeast Nigeria.

The suspected Boko Haram onslaught in Borno, and the alleged shooting of 22 churchgoers in nearby Adamawa, came just a week after Nigeria's new military chief vowed to end the violence.

No reason was given for the attacks, which have fuelled fears that the Islamist group - whose name means 'Western education is forbidden' - are growing in strength.

The two attacks in Born and Adamawa come days after the Nigerian military chief vowed to end violence. Devastation at the hands of Boko Haram has ripped through the nation since 2009 (2011 attack pictured)

The first strike in Kawuri, 23 miles from state capital Maiduguri, happened at about 4pm on Sunday when gunmen in four-wheel-drive vehicles opened fire with machine guns.

Witnesses claim the gang set off homemade bombs that destroyed houses and other property.

One trader who witnessed the latest 
attack, said: 'The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles, improvised 
explosive devices and petrol bombs.

'They entered the community and wreaked havoc before they fled into the Sambisa forest, which is not far from the village.

'It
 was much, much later that security forces came and it was night 
already, and the attackers had earlier subdued the soldiers that were 
already on the ground.'

Meanwhile, emergency relief and disaster agencies were deployed to a Roman Catholic church in the village of Waga Chakawa, in Adawama, where gunmen allegedly opened fire before setting homes ablaze. At least 22 were killed.

Borno state police commissioner Lawan 
Tanko said of the market strike: 'So far, we have 45 dead and 26 injured... but the figures 
could increase as our men are still in the village searching for more 
casualties.'

Critics of the military strategy fear the latest attacks mean Boko Haram are strengthening as civilians flee

Mr Tanko, who blamed the attack on 'the Boko Haram sect', said he could not confirm that explosives were used but a specialist bomb disposal team had been sent in to search for unexploded devices.

He added that security forces in Kawuri were powerless to prevent the attack, the latest in a string of similar incidents which have killed 1,200 civilians since the province was placed under emergency rule last May.

Nigeria's military claims Boko Haram, which started its insurgency in 2009, has forced the Islamist extremists out of towns and cities and into more remote rural areas near the border.

But critics of the military strategy claim the habitual attacks have also driven thousands of civilians to flee to neighbouring Cameroon, Niger and Chad.

The country's president, Goodluck Jonathan, this month replaced his most senior military officers after a car bomb killed 19 in a crowded market in Maiduguri.

Nigeria's new chief of defence staff, Air Marshall Alex Badeh, has vowed to bring the insurgency to 'a complete stop' before April.
