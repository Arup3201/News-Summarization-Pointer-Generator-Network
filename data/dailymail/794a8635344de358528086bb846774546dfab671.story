A school teacher has been blasted by furious parents after he told junior school pupils that Santa Claus did not exist as they wrote their letters to him.

The teacher was taking a literacy lesson which involved the children, aged eight and nine, writing a letter to Father Christmas.

During the class he told the youngsters that the man bringing them presents just wasn't real - and the Year Four pupils were left devastated.

Dispelling the myth: Eight and nine-year-old pupils at Christchurch Junior School in Dorset were writing letters to Santa when their teacher broke the news that he didn't exist, causing a stream of complaints

The school in Christchurch, Dorset, has now been met with a stream of complaints from furious parents.

A parent of an eight-year-old child in the
class said: ‘I was fuming when I found out. I spoke to the teacher and 
to the headteacher.

'The headteacher apologised, but the teacher seemed 
shocked that people were complaining.

‘He told the children to put their hands over their ears if they did not want Christmas spoilt, so it was not accidental.'

One parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'This teacher has upset all our children'.

Headteacher Simon Adorian admitted that the teacher had made a mistake following what he described as an 'awkward exchange with pupils' after one of them quizzed him over Santa's existence.

Speaking to Mail Online, he said: 'He responded clumsily and didn't do his best.

'He was asked whether he existed and responded in a way, and with a look, that gave them doubt.

'He made a mistake, but we have covered it up, just as you do with children and they haven't asked about it anymore.'

He added that the teacher was 'mortified' by what had happened.

Official retraction: Christchurch Junior School headteacher Simon Adorian (pictured) was forced to issue an apology after one of his teachers told pupils that Santa didn't exist

'I have probably never spoken to someone who is feeling as sorry as this teacher, said Mr Adorian.

'He
is extremely sorry about it, nothing like this has ever happened 
before, we celebrate Christmas as traditionally as other schools.

'Children
left the room saying to their parents that Santa Claus isn't really 
real, which upset them, and that is the last thing I want.'

Royal Mail has offered some consolation to parents desperately trying to keep the spirit of Christmas alive, with a reminder on their website that letters to Santa must be sent by December 14th at the latest.

The message from Santa reads: 'Santa is 
extremely busy at the North Pole, making sure all the presents, 
including yours, are ready and wrapped for Christmas Eve.

'It’s a very exciting time for all; Rudolph and Santa can’t wait to land at your home with all your gifts.

'Rudolph is especially looking forward to eating the carrots you kindly leave and maybe a mince pie for Santa…

'Santa will respond to as many letters as possible, in between getting the sleigh ready for the long journey on Christmas Eve.

To
ensure Santa receives your letter on time please can you send to the 
following address no later than December 14th, and include your full 
name and address: Santa/Father Christmas, Santa’s Grotto, Reindeerland, 
SAN TA1'.
