Don't put away the brollies... it's back.

The rain which has drenched Britain 
for weeks throughout June and July is making a re-appearance - and 
ominous grey clouds are already starting to loom across the nation.

It looks set give the thousands of tourists who have flocked to Britain for the London 2012 Olympics a good old taste of British weather.

Meanwhile, millions of commuters battling the daily grind, as well as children on their school holidays up and down the country, will have to endure yet more showers.

Showers: Spectators watch the women's Group A hockey match between Netherlands and Japan in the rain, at the Riverbank Arena at the Olympic Park in London this morning

Wet: Sports fans huddle under umbrellas and ponchos at the hockey match between Netherlands and Japan. The wet weather looks set to continue for the rest of the week and heavy downpours are expected on Saturday

Last week saw a welcome reprieve from the wet weather when the sun shone brightly for several days and temperatures topped 30C.

Millions flocked to 
the coasts to bask in the rays, others took to open air pools to cool off while farmers who have been poised to begin harvest for weeks rushed to the fields with combine harvesters.

But summer, it seems, was short lived. The bad weather began in earnest for many this morning, when they woke up to pavements full of puddles.

Forecasters 
said it cleared up slightly this afternoon so those with tickets to 
outdoor events such as beach volleyball, hockey and archery did enjoy a bit of sunshine.

Ready for all weathers: Two spectators sits in the rain in the stands prior to the show-jumping phase of the equestrian eventing competition at Greenwich Park this morning - ready with brollies and wet weather gear

Those watching Zara Phillips and her fellow riders from Great Britain's 
equestrian team bid for gold at Greenwich Park experienced a
soggy start to the day but they saw a bit of sun later on.

Temperatures were expected to peak at 19C (66F) to 20C (68F) in the South
East today, while other areas such as Weymouth, Dorset, where the 
sailing took place, were due to be around 17C (63F) to 18C (64F).

Meanwhile, throughout the rest of this week, scattered 
showers, some heavy in places, and the odd rumble of thunder are expected
to make an appearance. Saturday is likely to see heavy downpours across
much of the UK with a 40 per cent chance of rain over London.

Washout: Spectators were also forced to get their brollies out as the heavens opened over Wimbledon during the Olympic tennis today

Rain stopped play: This pair looked particularly despondent at the drizzly conditions in SW19 which prevented some of the tennis

Clouding over: Spectators had to bring unseasonal amounts of layers while watching the tennis at Wimbledon this afternoon

Brollies at the ready: The map on the left shows the by lunchtime today rain will begin to soak parts of central and northern England, while by 1pm tomorrow, rain clouds will begin to move south heading for London

Wet: By Thursday lunchtime (left) rain looks set to soak much of the south coast, including Weymouth, where Olympic sailing events are being held, and by Friday, right, more cloud and scattered showers are expected

Tomorrow and Thursday will see a 20 per cent chance of rain in the 
capital, and strong gusts of wind of between 20mph and 30mph.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'There's
going to be bright and sunny spells around in London tomorrow but 
there's a chance of some showers.

'It's not looking like last week with the strong, hot and humid conditions which will probably be a relief for many athletes.

Wet weather gear: Two soggy but happy looking Great Britain fans sit alone in the stands as rain falls before the Team Eventing Jumping Final on day four of the London Olympic Games at Greenwich Park

Misery: Spectators huddled in flags and waterproofs wait as rain falls before the Team Eventing Jumping Final on day four of the Games at Greenwich Park, London

'For the rest of the UK will be 
wetter and the bulk of the train will be in Scotland, Wales and the 
North West. It's mixed weather elsewhere and temperatures about 
average.'

The only saving grace is that 
temperatures are expected to remain around the comfortable 18C to 24C 
mark for much of the UK, particularly in the South and South East.

This year's washout summer will strike fear into the hearts of brides after the rain has destroyed a huge crop of flowers used to make confetti.

Photos taken of a Worcestershire farm this time 
last year show fields of colourful delphiniums in full bloom and ready 
for harvest. The flowers are used to make confetti and are thrown at thousands of weddings around Britain.

Sad: The rain has destroyed huge crops of delphiniums at Wick Manor Farm which grows the petals for 
the Real Flower Petal Confetti Company in 
Worcestershire

Blossoming:Â  Fields of different coloured delphiniums in full bloom at the same farm in July last year when the sun shone in July - unlike this year

But
a picture taken exactly a year later shows the same 12-acre field of 
delphiniums looking more like weeds after seven weeks of constant rain 
shredded their fragile petals.

Many of the roots are also rotten as a result of the ground being waterlogged for such a long period of time.

The pictures were taken at the Real Flower Petal Confetti Company's Wyke Manor estate, Wick, Pershore.

Growers have been forced to delve into leftover petals from previous years after the summer downpours ruined this year's crop.

Confetti producer Nancy Preston, 41, said yesterday: 'This year's 
crop is all but ruined. We didn't have the sunshine in the beginning of 
July when we usually harvest the flowers.

'There's a lot of rotting at the roots and the petals don't like the 
rain. We could have coped with days of rain but not weeks. It was heavy 
rain every day.

'The
petals have been bruised by the constant rain and the petals can only 
be handpicked in the sunshine but even on the dry days there hasn't been
any sun so the petals remain sodden.

'They never really came into 
full bloom in mid July like they normally do. We have been able to get a
tiny harvest but it's not as good as previous years.'
