Orlando police used a department training exercise Friday to search for a mother of three who went missing the same day she appeared  in an episode of The People's Court in 2011.

Michelle Parker, 33, of Orlando was last seen November 17 dropping her three-year-old twins off at the home of ex-fiancé Dale Smith, whose legal quarrel over a $5,000 engagement ring featured in an episode of the show recorded earlier that year.

WOFL reported about 100 officers searched an area of Belle Isle about two miles south of Orlando International Airport without finding any trace of Parker, whose cell phone last pinged nearby.

Police have searched the area before, and though the three-hour investigation of the grounds did not turn up any new evidence, it was heartening for Parker's parents. 

'I don’t like it. It makes me angry that we have to go through this all the type because it’s really painful and hard but I’m happy,' Parker's mother Yvonne Stewart said according to News 13. 

Parker's Hummer had been found the day after she disappeared at an apartment complex in Orlando with the decals for her tanning business peeled from the windows.

Her family has continuously pushed for answers about her disappearance. 

'It's agony not knowing what happened to your child,' Stewart told ABC. 'They thought they should go back and take a look at these woods.'

Stewart says authorities told her one piece of evidence police hoped to find was the missing decal that might have been taken from the Hummer.

Investigation continues: Though the family still harbors hope that authorities will uncover new evidence about Parker's disappearance, the case has cooled over the past few years

No leads: Smith, pictured during the show, is the only person of interest in his ex-fiancee's disappearance, but has never been charged

Distraught: Parker's mother and other family members have pushed hard for investigations to continue in spite of little evidence noting Parker's whereabouts

'I don't want to find her dead. I want to find her alive,' said Parker's father, Brad.

On the episode of courtroom series 'The People's Court,' recorded the summer before her disappearance, Parker and Smith squared off over a $5,000 engagement ring.

The show revealed a 'violent' history of her relationship with Smith, who had been dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 following a reported court martial and military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery.

Smith was charged with domestic battery during their relationship, after which Parker filed a request for a restraining order in 2009, which was denied, 

In her filing she said he 'smashed the passenger side window in my SUV' and 'took car seats out and threw them in the road'. She also alleged that he yelled to her: 'Your day is coming.'

'He gets pretty malicious and vindictive,' she said of him on The People's Court, 'and he's a mean person especially when he's been drinking.'

Smith had sued Parker, claiming she lost the engagement ring when she threw it at him in a fight at a Hilton hotel during a science fiction convention.

People's Court judge Marilyn Milian found in favor of Smith on the episode and ordered Parker to pay $2,500. 

A friend, Angela Launer, told ABC around the time of the disappearance that Smith was known to abandon Parker in out of the way places.

'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing the relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'.

Police have not charged Smith in relation to his ex-fiancée's disappearance, but he is currently being considered a person of interest in the investigation.

Smith currently has custody of the couple's twin children. Parker also had a son from a previous relationship who was 10 years old at the time of her disappearance.

An attorney for Smith told ABC that Smith had not committed any crime. 

The family revealed after her disappearance that Parker left a short message the day before she went missing in which she sounded normal and asked her father to make plans to call her.

‘Hey Dad, it's about 8:40. This is Michelle on Wednesday morning,’ she said. ‘I know that you're at work, but call me when you have lunch or you have break or the end of your day.’

The family spent Thanksgiving with about 50 volunteers, searing within a two-mile radius from a cell tower that had last pinged her location, reported the Orlando Sentinel.

‘I'm thankful that my sister has not been found in a bad way, because every day that doesn't happen, I still have hope that she's still out there somewhere,’ her sister Lauren Erickson told ABC at the time. 

Her friend Angela Launer told ABC Mr Smith was known to abandon her in out of the way places.

'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing their relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'.

Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, has maintained that Smith is not responsible for her daughter's disappearance.

'Who would want to hurt the mother of their children?' she told ABC. 'I don't see how in any way he would benefit from it. I know in my heart of heart that she's been carjacked.’

'That the people saw an expensive car and a girl who looks like she has money and I know they've made a mistake and I know that they want to fix this and I forgive them.’
