Two Champions League-winning sides came together to celebrate Portuguese midfielder Deco's testimonial on Friday, marking the end of the career of one of Europe's greatest midfielders of the 21st century.

The game, featuring the likes of Lionel Messi, Eidur Gudjohnsen, Benni McCarthy and Paulo Ferreira, ended 4-4, with Samuel Eto'o scoring twice and Deco getting the decisive strike for Porto having played for both sides.

On an emotional occasion the Portuguese playmaker nipped in with a tidy finish in the 89th minute, which proved to be the last touch of the game. But Eto'o's cheeky antics were what had most people talking.

Porto: Baia, Ferreira, Costa, Emanuel, Valente, Costinha, Maniche, Mendes, Deco (Jankauskas 46), Derlei, McCarthy.

Goals: Derlei 3; McCarthy 15; Jankauskas 62; Deco 89.

Barcelona: Jorquera, Oleguer, Belletti, Gerard, Sylvinho, Davids, Van Bommel, Van Bronckhorst, Giuly (Deco 46), Ezquerro (Eto'0 46), Gudjohnsen (Messi 46).

Goals: Eto'o 54, 68; Deco 57, Messi 81

The centre forward, who spearheaded Barca's attack in 2006, was on top form. The first of his two goals came after he waited on the goalline for a defender to catch him before tapping in.

And even before the game he was posing for the camera's as the camera panned across the assembled stars, which bizarrely included Edgar Davids despite him only playing for Barcelona in 2004.

But the evening was all about Deco - he ended up scoring and setting up goals for both sides on a fitting end to a trophy-heavy career that took in time with both of these sides as well as Chelsea.

Derlei, Benni McCarthy scored for Porto as they raced into a 2-0 first half lead, and Edgaras Jankauskas also bagged for the Portuguese side. Messi scored Barcelona's third on the night, converting a rare header from an Eto'o cross.

But it was of course left to Deco to finish it off, placing a brilliant finish off the the underside of the bar (in a Porto shirt this time) to make it 4-4 before the referee recognised the ideal time to blow the final whistle and pull the curtain down on Deco's time in football.

Afterwards, Messi paid tribute to the man of the occasion. 'Deco deserved this, both as a footballer and as a person,' he said.

'Heâ€™s a player I learned a lot from, as did so many other team-mates. There was no way I was going to miss this event.'
