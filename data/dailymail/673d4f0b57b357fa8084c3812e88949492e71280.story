Christian Atsu first piqued Roberto Martinez's interest when he rose through the ranks at Porto three years ago and the Everton manager says the loan signing will add an extra dimension to his squad.

The 22-year-old passed his medical at Goodison on Wednesday evening to become Everton's fifth signing of the summer, and took to Twitter to post a picture of himself and Martinez.

Martinez said: 'He is quite rare in what he is as a winger. We saw signs of the player that he can be when he was coming through at Porto.

'He has been successful at Vitesse and I know I see a young man with potential who is hungry to do well. Now I'm just so excited to be bringing him to the club. 

'Not just as a young man with great potential but already representing Ghana in the World Cup.

'The loan market is what it is, we always want to use that to our advantage. Here again is a really good opportunity to the three parties - the parent club, ourselves and the player.

'I do expect a little bit of an adaptation period. He hasn't played in the Premier League and that always requires that period. The way he played in the World Cup and the way he adapted to the conditions in Brazil, I'm sure it'll be a short period.

'Christian arriving has gave us an extra option, an extra boost in the squad so I would say that everyone is in a position that is ready to help the team.'

And Martinez says it is important that he gets to know the man behind the football, too.

'Christian and I - we had a really good time (on Wednesday) and we shared a lot of football stories, and we've brought the right characters in to the club. When you sign a player, you sign a footballer. It's different to get to know the human being.

'Everyone shares a real hunger and a real desire to give something to the team, and that's exactly what we want.

'Seamus Coleman has been working well - it's too early to know if he'll be available for Saturday (away against Leicester City) but he's training with the team. 

'The same has to be said with (Romelu) Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas. They arrived a little later due to World Cup demands.'

Martinez added he did not know where the rumours surrounding the departure of Arouna Kone came from.

Atsu became Everton's fifth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway.

Busy: Martinez has brought in five new faces to Goodison Park with a new Premier League season ahead

Atsu, who spent last season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem, told evertontv on Wednesday: 'I'm very happy to be joining Everton because it's a great club, which likes to play football, and it's a great pleasure to be here.

'Playing in the Premier League has always been a dream for me and I have achieved that dream.

'This is the biggest level for me to play at. I know that it's a very competitive league and I believe with hard work we're going to be successful this season.'
