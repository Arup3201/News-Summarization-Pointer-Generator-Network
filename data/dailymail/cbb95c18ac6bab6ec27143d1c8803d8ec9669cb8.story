Two girls will be forced to have the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine against their will after a High Court ruling.

The children, aged 11 and 15, were told it was ‘in their best interests’ to have the vaccine despite telling the court they didn’t want it.

They were due to receive the injection yesterday but the procedure has been postponed due to ‘practical difficulties’, according to the solicitor of the girls’ mother.

Ruling: The children, aged 11 and 15, were told it was 'in their best interests' to have the vaccine despite telling the court they didn't want it

The ruling came after their divorced parents disagreed over the children having the inoculation. It is only the third case of its kind in the High Court.

The girls’ mother, named only as Mrs F, doesn’t want them to have the inoculation because she fears side effects.

But their father has pushed for the girls to be protected against MMR. The sisters, named in court documents as L and M, live with their mother.

The ruling was revealed by BBC Newsnight, which obtained the court papers.

According to the Newsnight report, a court-appointed guardian was concerned that the girls had been ‘strongly influenced’ by their mother.

The report said that the girls’ father initially favoured his daughters not receiving the vaccination but changed his mind after the measles epidemic in Wales earlier this year.

In evidence given to the High Court, the girls’ mother said: ‘Parents have a choice to do what they feel in their hearts they really believe.

I feel both children have grown up in a frame of mind which they were settled in and supported in the same outlook and are now forced to take a different view without more positive reassurance and the recording of ingredients [of the vaccine] is unsatisfactory. They have a right to be informed.’

However Mrs Justice Theis said the girls felt obliged to agree with their mother and are not able to form an opinion on their health independently.

She said ‘weight should be attached to the wishes of mature children,’ but in this ‘unfortunate’ case the children could not decide for themselves.

The couple, who married in 1996 and divorced in 2011, agreed their daughter L would be inoculated as a baby but changed their mind and agreed she should not have a booster jab. They decided that M would not be vaccinated.

Solicitor Phillipa Dolan, representing the mother said the children had been brought up with the idea that ‘if you are healthy, you eat properly, you have a good immune system, then it’s not necessary to be vaccinated’.

She said the girls also believed the ‘side effects can be harmful’.

Asked if the two girls had been vaccinated, Miss Dolan said: ‘No, there have been practical difficulties in forcing the order and that is, at the moment, an ongoing issue.’

Nicholas Cusworth QC, of the Family Law Bar Association, said: ‘In this case the judge decided that the views expressed by this 15-year-old weren’t sufficiently balanced, weren’t sufficiently sensible and didn’t give sufficient weight to the positive side of the immunisation.’
