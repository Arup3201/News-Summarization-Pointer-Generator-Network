CIA Director-designate John Brennan's vigorous defense of drone strikes to kill terror suspects - even American citizens - overseas is causing lawmakers to consider lifting secrecy from the drone program and push to regulate its use.

Brennan, President Barack Obama's top counter terror adviser, was grilled for more than three hours Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee on the drone program he leads and on leaks of classified information to the media, which Brennan vehemently denied being a part of.

Despite Brennan's wide-ranging testimony and the White House's release of a top secret memo explaining its legal rationale for the strikes just hours before the confirmation hearing began, some senators afterward said it was time to bring the drone program into the open.

In the hot seat: John Brennan addressed a number of issues- including the drone strikes- at the hearing

Protests: Brennan was interrupted repeatedly by people protesting the drone strikes

In a hearing that was marred by 
anti-drone protests that brought it to a brief halt at the outset, 
Brennan told the committee that missile strikes by the unmanned drones 
are used only against targets planning to carry out attacks against the 
United States, never as retribution for an earlier one.

'Nothing could be further from the truth,' he declared.

Referring to one American citizen 
killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011, he said Anwar al-Awlaki had ties to 
at least three attacks planned or carried out on U.S. soil.

They 
included the Fort Hood, Texas, shooting that claimed 13 lives in 2009, a
 failed attempt to down a Detroit-bound airliner the same year and a 
thwarted plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010.

'He was intimately involved in activities to kill innocent men women and children, mostly Americans,' Brennan said.

Clear message: A secret drone report was shared with the Senators at the hearing following a leak earlier this week

After the hearing the committee's chairwoman, Democratic
 Sen Dianne Feinstein said she wanted 
to make the program more open to the public so U.S. officials can 
acknowledge the strikes and correct 'exaggerated' 
reports of civilian casualties.

Sen Feinstein said she and other senators 
were considering legislation to set up a special court system to 
regulate drone strikes, similar to the one that signs off on government 
surveillance in espionage and terrorism cases.

Brennan said drones are only used on targets planning attacks on the U.S. - never as retribution

Speaking with uncharacteristic 
openness about the classified program, Sen Feinstein said the CIA had 
allowed her staff to make more than 30 visits to the agency's northern 
Virginia headquarters to monitor strikes but that such transparency 
needed to be increased.

Her comments came after the White House, under 
pressure from the committee, gave senators on the panel a Justice 
Department memo outlining the legal justification for drone strikes. But
 senators complained that their staff wasn't allowed to see it.

'I think the process set up internally
 is a solid process,' Feinstein said of the methods used to decide when 
to launch drones and against whom, but added: 'I think there's an 
absence of knowing exactly who is responsible for what decision. So I 
think we need to look at this whole process and figure a way to make it 
transparent and identifiable.'

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a member 
of the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel also had been 
looking at establishing a 'court-like entity' to review the strikes.

'I think the House and Senate ought to
 put their heads together and come up with some way to require either 
initially or after the fact, a review of an operation when it takes the 
life of an American citizen,' Mr Schiff said.

Under oath: The hearings were watched even more closely because of the recently-leaked memo about the use of drones, as Brennan is thought to have been the 'architect' of the program

Next step: Brennan is a veteran of more than three decades in intelligence work, and most recently served as Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser in the White House

In a long afternoon in the witness 
chair, Brennan was questioned on other issues, such as the use of 
waterboarding and other interrogation techniques in the George W. Bush 
administration.

He declined to say whether he believes
 waterboarding, 
which simulates drowning, amounted to torture, but he said firmly it was
 'something that is reprehensible and should never be done again.'

Brennan, 57, is a veteran of more than
 three decades in intelligence work. He withdrew his name from 
nomination to head the CIA four years ago amid questions about the role 
he played at the CIA when the Bush administration approved waterboarding
 and other forms of 'enhanced interrogation' of suspected terrorists.

More common: Fewer than 50 strikes took place during the Bush administration while more than 360 strikes have been launched under Obama

On the question of waterboarding, 
Brennan said that while serving as a deputy manager at the CIA during 
the Bush administration, he was told such interrogation methods produced 'valuable information.'

Targets: Strikes are carried out in Yemen, where three American citizens with al Qaeda connections have been killed including Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured in 2008)

Now, after reading a 300-page summary of a 
6,000-page report on CIA interrogation and detention policies, he said 
he does 'not know what the truth is.'

Brennan bristled once 
when he was questioned about leaks to the media about an al-Qaida plot 
to detonate a new type of underwear bomb on a Western airline.

Republican Sen James Risch accused 
him of having leaked classified information in a telephone call with 
former government officials who were preparing to make television 
appearances to explain the plot.

'I disagree with that vehemently,' the nominee shot back.

On May 7 of last year the CIA thwarted an ambitious plot by al-Qaida's 
affiliate in Yemen to destroy a U.S.-bound airliner, using a bomb with a
 sophisticated new design.

The bombing would have taken place near the 
anniversary of the killing by U.S. Navy SEALs of Osama bin Laden.

The 
next day, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times reported that the
 would-be bomber was cooperating with U.S. authorities.

Time to talk: The hearing was led by Senator Dianne Feinstein (right) and Brennan (left) had to answer legal questions about the use of drones

Risch and Sen Dan Coats of Indiana 
were among those who contended Brennan inadvertently had revealed that 
the U.S. had a spy inside Yemen's al-Qaida branch when, hours after the 
first report appeared, he told a group of media consultants 'there was 
no active threat during the bin Laden anniversary because ...
 we had inside control of the plot.'

Brennan won praise from several members of the committee as the day's proceedings drew to a close.

'I think you're the guy for the job, and the only guy for the job,' said Democratic Sen Jay Rockefeller.

The panel will meet in closed session next week to discuss classified material.
