A world map redrawn according to each country's population has reduced the land down under to a tiny speck.

The new cartogram, created by Reddit user TeaDranks, visibly compares Australia's population of 23.7 million to countries with significantly larger numbers like China and India.

Such countries virtually dominate the map while nations with a population of about one million or under are barely visible, while some are too small to even make it on the map.

Smaller populations which have large geographic areas like Australia, Canada and Russia have notably been reduced on the map.

China's land mass on the map has increased thanks to its population of 1.4 billion and same goes for India which has 1.3 billion.

Other nations like Fiji with 859,000, Iceland with 328,000, Macau with 631,000, and Malta with 416,000, have been scaled down to a micro square.

Countries with less than 250,000 - such as Greenland which has a population of 56,000 - were too small to appear on the cartogram.

The map is an updated version of the first one released by the same creator 10 years ago.

Since then, it shows that India has grown by almost 200 million people while China has increased by about 60 million.

Australia's population, according to the map, has risen by more than three million since 2005.
