Being told that you have a life-changing injury that means you may never walk again can be a hard thing to process and explain to others, even as an adult. 

For children who are told that their world is about to change, and have to deal with that information, it can be more than overwhelming- it can be impossible. 

A world first initiative has just been introduced to help make talking about spinal cord injuries much easier for children who live with the condition much easier, all with the help from two very special heroes.

Evander Conroy, 3, and Izak Hassan, 10, have been transformed into cartoon superheroes for two books designed to empower children with spinal cord injuries talk about their condition, and to encourage others to open up discussions about how and why they occur.

The comic books are based on the real life stories of Evander and Izak, who are all living with the effects of a spinal cord injury and are keen for their friends and family to be able to talk about spinal cord injuries in a way that isn't intimidating or confusing.

Dr. Adrienne Epps, SpineCare Foundation Board Director and Head of Rehabilitation at Sydney Children’s Hospital, said that often children are marginalised or excluded because people don't know how to respond to seeing people so young in wheelchairs.

'I think it's quite challenging for children at times when they're out in the community and people stare or say ‘you poor thing’ or just don't know what to do and will turn away and not say hello.'

'Spinal cord injury is quite a hard thing to explain, and I had a lot of parents asking me why more wasn't being done for children with spinal cord injuries. They were absolutely correct,' she said.

After undergoing chemotherapy in the first six months of his life, Evander has been in and out of hospitals ever since to learn how to live with his injury which has significantly impacted his mobility, and has caused other ongoing medical issues

'I think the books provide a beautiful visual resource but also having those characters, those real children as part of this framework of the book makes it more powerful and personal.'

One of the children featured in the comic books, titled which have been lovingly created by the SpineCare Foundation in collaboration with Medikidz, is Evander Conroy, who was born with a spinal cord injury as the result of compression from a tumour.

After undergoing chemotherapy in the first six months of his life, Evander has been in and out of hospitals ever since to learn how to live with his injury which has significantly impacted his mobility, and has caused other ongoing medical issues. 

Evander's mother Claire Conroy said that he is often very self-conscious when he goes out in public because he draws a lot of attention.

'He just wants to do what other kids do and doesn’t really think about it until he’s put in a situation where he can't,' she said.

'While he's grown up with an older brother and sister and is aware that they are not the same as him, we’re coming to a point where we have to talk about why he’s different and in a wheelchair and not like other kids.'

Evander is starting preschool next year and Ms Conroy said that the books will be invaluable in helping him explain to his classmates why he is in a wheelchair. 

'He can take it along to his class and teacher can read it to them all. It can be used as a starting point, instead of him having to explain it to them all individually,' she said.

Izak Hassan, who has been living with a spinal cord injury since he was in a car accident at 14 months

‘He gets really frustrated at school because the younger kids are always asking him why he's in a wheelchair,' said his mother Diana Hassan

'If they get that out of the way first he can just get on with being a kid.'

Dr. Epps said that the books were a way of opening up discussions not just for the children affected, but for a whole new generation of kids who would now be much more aware of the condition.

'It is about looking at effective ways of getting the message out, and explaining what spinal cord injuries are and what it's like to live with them,' she said.

Ms Conroy said that Evander  had insisted they read 'his book' before bed time, and was excited to be in a comic book, as were his siblings.

'They are understanding more about why he is the way he is. It's a hard concept for his brother Orson, who is only four, and he understood that his brothers legs don’t work but figuring out why was much harder,' she said.

Izak is one of five siblings, and his mother Diana said that people will often assume that because he is in a wheelchair he must have other medical conditions

'I heard him talking to Evander about the spinal cord using words in the right context. I was quite amazed that a four and a half year old would just get it the way he did.'

One of the other newly minter heroes is Izak Hassan, who has been living with a spinal cord injury since he was in a car accident at 14 months.

‘He gets really frustrated at school because the younger kids are always asking him why he's in a wheelchair,' said his mother Diana Hassan.

'The books will be great because they'll educate the kids that ask and are curious. People think that if you’re in a wheelchair that there must be something else wrong with you.'

Ms Hassan said that Izak doesn't often like to talk about why he's in a wheelchair, but that the books have helped his friends to celebrate him.

'He struggled with it at first because he doesn’t like talking about it, but he’s loving it now. His friends at school made a big deal and raised money for the SpineCare Foundation.'

Evander's mother said that getting awareness out in the community about spinal cord injuries was crucial to increasing knowledge about the condition.

'When adults hear the words 'spinal cord injury', they immediately associate them with negative ideas,' she said.

'But he's still a child and he he doesn’t know what’s possible and what’s not. We don’t want to put any limitations on what he can achieve, with the wheelchair or without it.'

'Giving him that idea, to keep trying, keep pushing, keep searching out new possibilities, is what we want to share with him.' 

The two comic books, 'Evander's MediTotz Adventure' or 'MediKidz Explain Spinal Cord Injury' can be accessed for free online, in time for Spinal Injury Awareness Week (9-15 November).

The books are based on their real life experiences of living with the injuries, which can be difficult to explain and make them self-conscious
