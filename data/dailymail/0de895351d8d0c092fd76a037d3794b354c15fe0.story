The TV dinner is still alive and kicking with 50 per cent of Brits admitting they eat in front of the television - an increase from five years ago when 40 per cent said the same.

And the growing trend of the 'always on' digital generation, means that 20 per cent of Brits will have their dinner in front of a computer at least four times a week.

While the dinner table is still regarded by the Great British public as the last bastion of family values, one in seven Brit households don't own one (15 per cent) and over a third (34 per cent) rarely or never use them, a report revealed.

TV dinners: Half of Brits admit to eating their dinner in front of the television a new survey revealed

More than 80 per cent of Brits surveyed believe the dinner table is still the best place for families to come together.

However, despite this belief, living circumstances and balancing work demands with family life mean that modern British families are not able to do this more often.

Just under two thirds (63 per cent) of Brits said they are being kept away from eating with their friends, families and loved ones due to lack of free time in daily schedules, work commitments, space restrictions, and distance. 

The nationwide trend of working longer hours is having a direct impact on British dining habits with 7.5 per cent of Brits admitting to eating theirs at work at least four times a week. 

This more than doubles in the capital with 18 per cent of Londoners saying they do the same.

Additionally, 11 per cent of Londoners admitted to eating in the bath and 14 per cent said they eat in their bedrooms at least four times a week.

The study was commissioned as part of the recently launched Bisto Together Project, a campaign that seeks to bring more people together at mealtimes.

To mark the launch of the campaign 100 specially designed, space-saving dinner tables were given away to families. 

Made by The Wilson Brothers, the tables are designed to meet the demands of space-short families across and can be collapsed and stored in the smallest of homes. 

Helen Warren-Piper, from Bisto said: 'Bisto has over 100 years' experience of bringing British families together over the dinner table and we want to help this tradition continue for years to come.

'The Bisto Together Project is on a quest to help the British public overcome their barriers and come together more often with those that are close to them to share memorable moments around the table.'
