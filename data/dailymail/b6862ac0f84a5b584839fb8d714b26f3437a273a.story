A victim of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal - who fell pregnant twice and even tried to end her life - claims she is still on a waiting list for counselling.

Abuse victim 'Jessica' - whose named has been changed to protect her identity - was raped and abused for two years and tried to take her life when no-one would help her.

She has now issued a plea for better support for victims like herself in a letter to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

Her letter reveals how she was abused by a man for two years, starting when she was 14, before falling pregnant twice and attempting suicide as a result of the horrific abuse.

Now aged 29, Jessica tells how despite her ordeal she is still awaiting counselling to support her.

The mother-of-two said: 'I was diagnosed with depression about a year and a half ago - it took me a while to realise I needed help.

'I first went to the clinic about a year ago and was put on medication. But it just made me feel like a black cloud floating around - I came off it and have since been seeking counselling.

'I was given dates in September to see someone, but I never heard any confirmation. I need better help than medication but I still haven't seen anyone.'

She added: 'These clinics do all they can but there just isn't the funding there to support everyone. It's frustrating. Sex abuse victims exist all over the country, not just in Rotherham.

'I need someone to help me deal head on with my issues - I've been brushing what happened to me under the carpet for so many years.'

The victim's plea follows the publication of the Jay Report which revealed at least 1,400 children were victims of sexual exploitation in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013.

A petition organised by Jessica reads: 'In the wake of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, detailed in Professor Alexis Jay's report, we call for more funding to be made available for counselling services for abuse victims.

'I want to raise awareness for victims and survivors like myself to help prevent this happening to anyone else.

'I believe if I'd had the correct support and counselling when I was a child it would have helped me and my son have a more stable and structured life.

'I had a bad time and I tried to kill myself. I felt really dirty. I just felt I was below everybody and not worthy of anything.'

The victim said she wanted to speak face to face with the Justice Secretary, saying: 'I would ask him, "Imagine if it were your daughter? Imagine if she had gone through what I was put through? Doesn't she deserve to know there are people who are on her side?"

'The only reason I've kept myself together is because I've got people backing me, including my family. Without them I would have fallen to pieces a long time ago.

'But there are other people out there going through this alone and they're not getting the help they're owed.'

Jessica's main abuser met her shortly after her 14th birthday and - despite being known to the police and social services - raped and attacked her until she was 16, by which time she'd 'lost count' of how many times she was abused.

Despite her parents informing police within days of the abuse starting, officers said they could do nothing and have never made any arrests.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said they were working to increase funding for victims' services, hoping to 'double' the £50m it currently spends.

He said: 'This Government agrees that victims of heinous crimes like rape and sexual abuse should receive the specialist support they need to help them cope and recover.

'That's why we delivered on the pledge to put rape support centres on a more secure financial footing as well as help establish 15 new ones.

'We are also working to double the £50m we have historically provided to a wide range of victims' services.

'This year more money than ever before is being spent to support victims, much of which is now allocated to Police and Crime Commissioners so they can ensure local services meet local need.'

The victim's pleas came as a leading police officer said there could be 'many more' cases of child sex abuse like that uncovered in Rotherham.

Norfolk Police Chief Constable Simon Bailey told the Guardian the issue of child sex exploitation had 'for too long been a hidden crime'.

He added: 'We don't know for sure but I think it's tens of thousands of victims [a year] of an appalling crime.'

Mr Bailey, the national lead officer for the child protection and abuse investigation, admitted that continued investigations into police forces across the UK could see 'many more Rotherhams to come'.

He also warned that other figures in authority including teachers and health workers have a responsibility to look out for and report signs of possible child abuse.
