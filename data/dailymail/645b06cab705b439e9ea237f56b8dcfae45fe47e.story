Three people have been tested for bird flu as the slaughter of 10,000 chickens begins on a farm struck by Britain's first outbreak of the H7N7 strain in seven years.

Officers ordered that the entire flock at the farm in Upham, Hampshire, be culled, and they imposed a 1km (0.6 miles) exclusion zone around the site after the chickens tested positive for the strain of avian influenza.

It is understood that three people, including an official from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), were tested for the disease after showing symptoms but were proved to be negative.

All of the birds at the commercial chicken breeding farm, which has not been named, are to be slaughtered as part of action to prevent any spread of the disease.

The outbreak was confirmed last Friday following several deaths amongst the chickens, according to a source.

It is the second outbreak of bird flu in in just four months, but this time it has been identified as the H7 strain, which officials insisted was 'much less severe' than the H5N8 strain found at a Yorkshire duck farm in November.

Defra said there are no links between the two cases and Public Health England said the risk to public health is very low, but scientists have shown that the virus can infect humans. 

H7N7 was detected in the UK in June 2008, when egg-laying hens at a farm in Banbury, Oxfordshire had to be culled. A spokesman from Defra told MailOnline that the previous case had been more serious than the current outbreak.

There have been several outbreaks of the H7N7 flu in China and 18 months ago it was found in Italy.

During the Italian outbreak in August 2013, three poultry workers became infected with the virus, developing conjunctivitis.

More than 1 million chickens and other poultry were culled during the Italian crisis. 

Tests carried out by scientists in Hong Kong in 2013 revealed there was a potential risk for humans after revealing that the strain can cause severe pneumonia in ferrets.

The exclusion zone around the farm will remain in place for at least three weeks while Defra officials work to establish exactly where the outbreak had stemmed from, and if it has spread. 

Chief Vet Nigel Gibbens said last night: 'We have taken immediate action to contain this outbreak as part of our robust procedures for dealing swiftly with avian flu.

'This is a low severity form of the virus and we are taking action to ensure that the disease does not spread or develop into a more severe form. 

'We are investigating the possible sources of the outbreak.

'I would urge poultry keepers in the surrounding area to be vigilant for any signs of disease and to ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.'

The outbreak is the second of the disease to hit the UK in four months, following the outbreak at a Yorkshire duck farm last November (pictured). Officials have insisted that the most recent case is 'much less severe'

Nick Phin, director for the Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control said: 'Based on what we know about this strain of avian influenza and the actions that have been taken, the risk to human health in this case is considered very low.

'Public Health England continues to work closely with Defra throughout this investigation.'

The Food Standards Agency said there was no risk to food supplies.

'On the basis of current scientific evidence, Food Standards Agency advice is that avian (bird) flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers,' a spokesman said.

'Laboratory investigations on the outbreak indicate that it is the N7 sub-type of H7 but this will need to be confirmed in further testing.' 

MP for Meon Valley George Hollingbery said the outbreak was 'very concerning'.

Officials said the chickens at the Hampshire farm had tested positive for the H7N7 strain of avian influenza

He said yesterday: 'I’ve been liaising closely with Public Health England, based in Fareham, Hampshire County Council and Defra throughout today to ensure I’m kept up to date with developments.

'It appears that all precautions have taken place to ensure this problem is dealt with effectively and the experts are doing all they can to identify exactly what type of H7 strain it could be.

'Most importantly, I have been told that presently any danger to the public is very low and this is very welcome news. The strain is a mild one and is not similar to the recent outbreak at a duck farm in East Yorkshire.

'However, there is no doubt the authorities are taking it very seriously and regular updates will be issued in due course.'

Dr Nicola Lewis, research associate in the Department of Zoology at University of Cambridge, said: 'If the virus is confirmed as a low pathogenic – or low severity – H7N7 avian influenza virus then the investigating authorities will try to work out where it might have come from and how it might have infected the chickens on the farm. It is a different subtype and severity of influenza virus from the H5N8 case last November in Yorkshire so these two outbreaks are not directly linked.

Public Health England said the risk to public health is very low. Pictured: Medication to treat bird flu strains

'Low pathogenic avian flu viruses naturally infect wild birds. These wild birds get several influenza infections a year, often with different subtypes of influenza, and usually these wild birds don't appear sick.

'These wild birds also migrate and can carry their influenza viruses among geographic regions.

'The investigating scientists will be able to compare the virus genetic material from this outbreak to influenza viruses in both wild and domestic birds, from both within and outside the UK to try to work out where it might have come from. In the meantime, the control measures taken on the farm by the UK authorities will ensure that the virus doesn't mutate into something more severe and so safeguard human health.' 

The last outbreak of bird flu, which is unrelated to the current case, saw 6,000 ducks culled at a farm in Nafferton, East Yorkshire, involving the H5N8 strain.

That farm was owned by Cherry Valley Farms, Britain's biggest duck producer, which supplies ready meals to M&S, Tesco, Lidl and Aldi.

There have been no cases of human infection with bird flu in the UK.  

Dr Derek Gatherer, Lecturer in Bioinformatics, Lancaster University, said: 'H7N7 is a completely different sub-type of avian influenza A to H5N8. 

'H5N8 is relatively new, and is a hybrid (“re-assortant” is the technical term) between the old H5N1 highly pathogenic strain and an unknown other strain. 

'H7N7 on the other hand is much more familiar, and exists in two continental varieties – North American and Eurasian. 

'I would guess that the Hampshire strain will turn out to be a Eurasian one. There have been occasional infections of humans with H7N7, most recently in Italy in late August 2013, and prior to that in the Netherlands in February 2003. 

'None of these cases were severe, and all patients fully recovered. The virus is only transmitted from birds to humans and not from person-to-person. There is no danger to the general public.' 

Ducks were culled at the farm in Nafferton, East Yorkshire, after strains of bird flu were detected

Britain's largest duck farmer – which supplies ready meals to M&S, Tesco, Lidl and Aldi – was at the centre of the first outbreak of bird flu in six years.

Cherry Valley Farms – which rears nearly half of the 15million ducks a year bred in the UK – was forced to cull all 6,000 birds at one of its sites in East Yorkshire last November.

Officials imposed an ‘exclusion zone’, restricting movement of poultry within six miles of the breeding farm which houses Pekin ducks that produce eggs to be hatched for their meat.

It came after the animals tested positive for bird flu, also known as avian flu.

At the time, officials said the outbreak may have been be linked to a strain of avian influenza, which originated in the Far East and  infected birds in Germany and the Netherlands.

It was the first serious case of bird flu in Britain since 2008, when the H7N7 strain was found in free-range laying hens near Banbury, Oxfordshire.
