A Thanksgiving Day fire at a Maine house hit close to home for firefighters — because it belonged to the local fire captain.

The blaze broke out at Captain Dave Hudson's rural house off North Bath Road in Bath at about 4 p.m. on Thursday.

But the Maine fire chief  lives so far from a hydrant, that firefighters were forced to douse the flames with water from a local pond.

His family, including his wife and children, his mother-in-law, and others all escaped unharmed, but one person was taken to hospital, according to The Times Record. 

Fire: A fire broke out at Captain Dave Hudson's house in Bath at 4 p.m. on Thursday

House: This appears to be the Fire chief's rural house which is 'far from any hydrants' in Bath, Maine, where the blaze took hold

Reports suggest that the Hudson family were at home when they heard the sound of fireworks, opened a door to investigate and discovered a fire in the garage.

Firefighters from several surrounding communities responded from Bath, West Bath, Topsham, Woolwich, Arrowsic, Brunswick and Harpswell with Wiscasset serving as standby.

Bath Fire Chief Christopher Cummings said there were no hydrants close to the house. 'We had to bring hoses in and pipe water from a pond, about 800-1,000 feet away,' he said.

He told The Times Record: 'There is a lot of smoke and water damage. But we think right now the rest of the house can be saved.'

Bath Police helped with traffic control, and the Mid Coast Hospital paramedic team was also on hand. 

Family: Hudson, seen here with an unidentified woman escaped unharmed from the fire

Hudson is a Bath Fire Captain who serves as Rescue Chief. He also works at Mid Coast Hospital as Director of Paramedic Services.

Cummings said the department will take care of the family because 'firefighters stick together.'
