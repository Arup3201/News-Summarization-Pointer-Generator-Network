A girl who clambered onto a multi-million pound sculpture at a London museum was just being 'anti-establishment', her fashion designer parents said today.

Art lovers were scandalised when a picture appeared on Twitter showing a family letting their children climb all over Donald Judd's $10million installation at Tate Modern.

But today the child's parents, Stuart Trevor, 47, and Kait Bolongaro Trevor, 45, were unrepentant, calling it a 'simple faux pas' and saying their nine-year-old daughter Sissi Belle had simply been 'seduced by a ladder of jewel-coloured shelving'.

Stuart and Kait Bolongaro Trevor with their children Sissi, nine, Louie, 14, and Harper, six - Sissi's parents defended her for climbing on the sculpture by saying she had 'always been anti-establishment'

Sissi Bella Trevor was seen climbing on the $10million Donald Judd installation Untitled 1980 at Tate Modern on Sunday

The couple, who founded the All Saints clothing chain and live in East London with Sissi, her six-year-old sister Harper Bea, and older brother, Louie, defended their children, saying they had visited galleries and museums around the world and were just interested in the sculpture, Untitled 1980.

Mrs Bolongaro Trevor told the Evening Standard: 'Their only crime was to be seduced by a ladder of jewel-coloured shelving.

'Sissi has always been anti-establishment but she would never hurt anybody.'

Mr Trevor, who sold All Saints in 2005 and now runs the Bolongaro Trevor label with his wife, added: 'They have been all around the world and are extremely intelligent and educated and just happened to slide in the bottom of what looks like a row of shelves.'

He insisted his girls were only on the sculpture for a few seconds, and said they were clever children who are obsessed by art.

Mr Trevor said the incident happened while the children were on a day out with their aunt Lucy and uncle Frank on Sunday afternoon.

Artwork: The sculpture by the post-war artist is made of perspex, steel and aluminium and resembles a ladder

A spokesman for Tate Modern, pictured, said: 'There is always risk of damage when visitors touch works of art'

He said Stephanie Theodore, who photographed the children on the sculpture and then tweeted it saying 'Holy crap.  Horrible kids, horrible parents', had been rude when she intervened to say they were climbing on art worth $10million.

But Ms Theodore, a New York gallery owner who put the photograph on Twitter at the weekend, was not impressed.

This afternoon she wrote on Twitter: 'It's easy to say one is anti-establishment as an excuse for bad behaviour when you have the money to do it.'

A spokesman for Tate Modern said: 'There is always risk of damage when visitors
touch works of art, but the sculpture has been checked by Tate’s conservation
team and no damage has been caused on this occasion.'

Donald Judd, who died in 1994, is hailed as one of the most significant post-war American artists, and his Untitled 1980 work, made out of steel, aluminium and perspex, is one of his most valuable creations.

Not impressed: Gallery owner Ms Theodore made her feelings on the subject clear on Twitter this afternoon
