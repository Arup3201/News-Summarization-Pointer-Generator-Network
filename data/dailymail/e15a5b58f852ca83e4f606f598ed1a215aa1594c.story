Aristrocrat Alexander Monson had concussion when he died in police custody in Kenya, an initial postmortem report stated today.

The 28-year-old former Marlborough schoolboy's mysterious death has become increasingly controversial since a friend claimed he may have suffered police brutality.

This allegedly happened after being arrested on suspicion of drugs offences near the beach resort of Diani.

Today, police spokesman Richard Mugwai revealed pathologists found evidence that the baronetcy heir had damage to his brain when he died.

He told a local journalist: 'Part of the pathologist's summary reads 'intracranial pressure due to brain concussion following blood drain into head', but we don't want to form any outside opinion.

'The details of the report have also been handed over to the family.' After Mr Monson's death in hospital on Saturday, a close friend suggested one cause may have been rough treatment by police.

Today, deputy commissioner Aggrey Adoli, who is in charge of Kenyan coast, maintained officers had treated him well.

He said: 'This person was found by members of the public smoking bhang (cannabis) outside Daduri night club and immediately police officers went there to arrest him.

'He was not beaten on any of those occasions. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and speculative.

'When he was in custody he complained of feeling dizziness and unwell, and immediate arraignment was done.

'Then he was rushed to Palm Beach Hospital with highly qualified and experienced doctors, and died in their hands while being examined.'

Mr Adoli, whose patch includes the popular palm-fringed beach of Diani, added that drugs were found in Mr Monson's clothes.

He said: 'A half-smoked 'sativa' cannabis was recovered from him and a further search was conducted and two white tablets were found in his trouser.

'The tablets have been taken to government chemist for analysis. We don't want to speculate at this point.'

The Briton is believed to have spent several weeks living with relatives based in Kenya.

Government pathologist Ngari Mbuuko and a private expert believed to have been hired by the Monson family conducted initial tests yesterday, at Pandya Memorial Hospital, in nearby Mombasa.

Meanwhile samples of urine, blood, liver, kidney and intestines were sent to the capital city Nairobi for further analysis by a government chemist.

Intracranial pressure is the pressure inside the skull that can increase due to brain injury.  Other causes can include tumour, bleeding into the brain or fluid around the brain, or swelling within it.

Mr Monson's body remains in the hospital morgue, and it is unclear when it will be released to the family.  It is believed that his next of kin may be given samples in order to have separate tests performed by an independent expert.

Contemporaries of Mr Monson at £30,300-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire included Pippa Middleton, also 28, but it is unclear whether they were friends.

Mr Monson lived in London but spent much of the year in Kenya with his mother Hilary, 58, and sister Isabella, 25. The pair run the Four Twenty South complex of self-catering cottages in the Indian ocean resort of Diani, where accommodation can cost up to £800 a night.

His maternal grandparents bought the business in the 1960s. As the heir to the Monson baronetcy, Alexander was born into a life of privilege.

His paternal grandfather was Lord Monson, a Lincolnshire landowner and peer. He was a champion of personal liberties who later became president of the Society for Individual Freedom.

When the 11th baron died last year, the title passed to Alexander’s father, Nicholas John Monson, born in 1955.

It is believed Baron (Nicholas) Monson, a publisher, is currently in Kenya with his third wife, Silvana.

Last night the dead man’s grandmother, Lady Emma Monson, said: ‘I’m a widow myself. I’m bereaved. I’m now grieving for my grandson. I’m extremely upset and I just can’t talk about it.’

Kenyan Police said Mr Monson died in hospital on Saturday following his arrest. Police spokesman Richard Mugwai said he had been in custody for just a few hours when he was rushed to hospital after starting to feel sick.

The officer said: ‘He was arrested outside a nightclub under the suspicion of having taken drugs.

‘We made preparations to interview and charge him but he then felt sick. We took him to the hospital and he died in the hands of the doctors.’

It is believed Mr Monson, who studied at London’s City University until 2008, entered Kenya on April 23 and was due to fly home on July 10.

Mr Mugwai, the commander of Kenya’s coastal Kwale County police division, said Mr Monson was taken to the police station under suspicion of having smoked bhang, a local variety of cannabis.

He was later moved to the nearby Palm Beach Hospital, where he died. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We have been providing consular assistance.’

Bhang is a natural drug made from dried seeds and leaves from the female cannabis plant. Its use originated in India and it is illegal in many countries. Popular on the backpacking scene, users often mix it with fruit or alcohol.

On his Facebook page, Mr Monson's father describes himself as ‘an enthusiastic cook, a relentless writer, an occasional poet, a passionate advocate, a wayward disciple of the teachings of Epicurus and the Stoics and a devoted Apostle of Alain de Botton’.

Last night a friend who knew the Monson family when they lived in Bampton, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It’s awful what happened, it makes me feel sick.

‘I heard he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly with a friend. The friend was released but apparently they found drugs on Alexander so he was handcuffed and taken.’
