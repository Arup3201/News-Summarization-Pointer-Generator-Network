After ten disastrous months as Manchester United manager, David Moyes was on the verge of the sack last night.

The 50-year-old Scot was said to have been summoned to an urgent meeting by the club’s owners, who have apparently lost patience with his performance.

However humiliating, Moyes’s exit will be exceptionally lucrative.

He is on £5million a year, including bonuses, with another five years left to run on his contract. His payout could be as high as £10million.

He was handpicked for the job by his predecessor, Alex Ferguson, whose success made United one of the biggest brands in world sport and secured a stock market listing in New York.

But that status has been put at threat by atrocious results under Moyes and social networking sites were quickly ablaze with rumours of his likely departure yesterday.

No official comment was made on the situation, leaving shocked fans and investors in the dark. The club’s share price dipped by 1.2 per cent.

It is possible that an official statement was being delayed because stock market rules strictly govern announcements that can affect share prices.

Lucrative: He is on £5million a year, including bonuses, with another five years left to run on his contract

Despite being hand-picked by his predecessor, Moyes has been marred by atrocious results this season

Last night, the share price for Manchester United dipped by 1.2 per cent as his future hung precariously

Reacting to developments, United fan and 
broadcaster Eamonn Holmes said on Twitter: ‘I’m sure David Moyes is a 
nice man, but he just didn’t understand our team and our players didn’t 
understand him. This is the right thing.’

Writer Toby Young joked: ‘Maybe David Moyes can get a job with Ukip. He’s proved himself very good at staying out of Europe.’

And broadcaster Jeremy Vine added: 
‘Please Manchester United, in the name of good sense and decency, do not
 sack David Moyes. Signed fans of Chelsea, ManCity and Liverpool.’

Rare 
support came from tycoon Lord Sugar who said: ‘He needs another season.’

It
 is thought Moyes was called in for talks with chief executive Ed 
Woodward and the Glazers, the US family that controls the club.

Fans dubbed Moyes 'The Chosen One' as Sir Alex implored them to get behind him, citing his excellent record

He is expected to be dismissed within 48 
hours with lifelong United player Ryan Giggs set to step in until a new 
manager is appointed.

Speculation that Sir Alex could return to the helm
 is believed to be misplaced, with Dutchman Louis van Gaal an early 
favourite.

The son of a football scout and pattern maker, Moyes grew up in the working-class Thornwood district of Glasgow.

After playing football in the lower 
leagues, he started his managerial career at unfashionable Preston, on a
 salary of about £50,000 a year.

He had broad success in 11 seasons at top-flight Everton before signing for United last May and starting work on July 1.

Because of his backing from Sir Alex, fans dubbed Moyes ‘The Chosen One’ but disillusion soon set in on the Old Trafford terraces.

An alarming decline has seen United collapse from champions to seventh in the Premier League table. They will end the season with their lowest points total since the Premier League was established in 1992.

Moyes, who is a practising Christian and Labour Party supporter, may be able to keep his United salary until he finds a new position.

It is possible however that the club has written an under-performance clause into his contract that would allow for a quick pay-off.

The length of Moyes’s contract was approved by Sir Alex who, having suffered a torrid start at United himself, wanted his successor to have extended job security.

Moyes and his wife Pamela live in a secluded house in Lancashire with their son David Jnr, who is a football agent, and daughter Lauren, who has been in the spotlight after falsely being accused of having an affair with a United player.

Moyes’s father and his mother-in-law also live in the grounds of the family home.

Moyes has told how he was out shopping with his wife when Sir Alex called to offer him his job.

He said: ‘I had my jeans on and my T-shirt. I had to drop my wife at the shopping centre and I’m saying to myself I’d never ever go to a meeting with Sir Alex with a pair of jeans on.’

Moyes and his wife met at a Scottish hotel two decades ago.

Of that first encounter, he has said: ‘She saw me once, and, well, that was it.’
