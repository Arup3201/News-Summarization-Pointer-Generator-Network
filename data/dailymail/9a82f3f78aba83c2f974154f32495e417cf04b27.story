If you thought the perfect holiday meant relaxing by the pool with a handsome man and the latest Hilary Mantel blockbuster, then think again.

While the gorgeous likes of David Gandy are invited, high brow Mantel is not, researchers have found.

Instead, the perfect holiday read is Fifty Shades of Grey, ideally perused during an 11 day trip in a sunny location five hours flight from the UK.

Holiday heaven: The perfect break would include plenty of time on the beach and the chance to get a golden tan

Well read: The ideal holiday would also involve a copy of 50 Shades of Grey, as well as a hunky Christian Grey type like David Gandy in tow

The dream location also includes a 20 mile private transfer from the airport and direct access to the beach from the accommodation which boasts a private pool.

But the ideal jaunt won't come cheap - with the average adult expecting to pay around £2,500 per head for the pleasure.

Researchers polled 2,000 adults to uncover the elements that made up an indulgent annual break.

Ordering room service, upgrading to first class and paying for a sunbed instead of lying on the sand were also declared elements of a perfect holiday.

Two thirds of those polled said peace and quiet was the most important aspect of a dream break away.

Sorry Easyjet! Budget travel doesn't feature on anyone's holiday wishlist

Sunshine, camera...pose! Striking a pose poolside also proved popular as did hiring a private butler

The Azores

A picturesque group of nine volcanic islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, the Azores boast an average summer temperature of 25C, which can be enjoyed on one of the scores of golden sandy beaches.

Flying time: 3h

Santorini, Greece

One of Greece's most unspoilt islands, Santorini is the most southerly member of the Cyclades island chain and benefits from year round sunshine, crystal clear water and spectacular white sand beaches. The Perivolas hotel, a luxury hotel that used to be a cave, should fit the bill for romantics.

Flying time: 5h, 30 mins

Marrakesh, Morocco

Not only is the Moroccan city wonderfully warm all year round, it's the perfect spot for a little retail therapy. Its bustling souks are home to thousands of bargains, while the adventurous can take a day trip to the stunning Atlas Mountains. The all-inclusive Club Med La Palmerie is good value.

Flying time: 3hr, 30 mins

Siwa Oasis, Egypt

On the edge of the 'Great Sand Sea' (the Sahara desert), Siwa is a beautiful spot complete with natural springs for bathing in and forests of date palm trees. Stay at Adrère Amellal - a boutique bolthole luxurious enough to satisfy even the fussiest of travellers.

Flying time: 4hrs, 45 mins

Bodrum, Turkey

Currently one of coolest destinations in the world, Bodrum is a great alternative to the busy Canaries. Blessed with stunning scenery and fabulous beaches, the Turkish resort is popular with the glitterati, including Jade Jagger. Try the exclusive Sandima 37 Suites for laid back luxe.

Flying time: 3hr, 30 mins

Roy Collett, founder of Colletts Travel, which commissioned the survey, said:

'The perfect holiday has a few must-have elements - guaranteed sunshine and peace and quiet seem high on the list.

'When we are used to such cold and miserable weather here it is understandable how we long for sun and a bit of luxury.

'We work very long hours so rest and relaxation combined with a touch of sight-seeing and shopping is the perfect way to spend a holiday."

The study also revealed the formula for a perfect break also includes the holiday being taken in July with the location being drenched in sunshine for nine hours a day.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, eight out of ten Brits would want to go abroad for their perfect holiday, and flying first class would be a must.

Ideally, once settled into the accommodation, the average holidaymaker would then love to spend at least three of the 11 days lounging by the pool.

A further three days would be spent on the beach, soaking up the sun and occasionally participating in water-sports or swimming in the sea.

Another day would be spent sightseeing and experiencing the local culture and tourist destinations.

And a couple of days would be dedicated to shopping in the local markets and shopping malls.

Travellers surveyed also said that they would need spending money of at least £834 and would particularly enjoy having a private butler at their beck and call.

Other popular holiday extras include having a meal on the beach, a daily massage and regular sunrise yoga classes.

Collett added: 'Flying first class really does seem the ultimate in luxury travel according to this poll.

'Many people may only dream of upgrading their flights but other things that people would want from a holiday are perfectly achievable.

'Depending on what country you are visiting, things like room upgrades, spa services and private transfers can be relatively affordable.

'Travelling further afield has become easier in recent years and visiting destinations like South America, Costa Rica, Cambodia and Vietnam are becoming much more popular with Brits.'
