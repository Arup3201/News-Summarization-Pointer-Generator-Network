An angry mother claims her daughter found a broken security tag lying inside her morning cereals.

Deena Jackson said six-year-old Beau had cut her finger on the jagged metal tag as she went to open the box of Shredded Wheat at their home.

The 34-year-old, who bought the Nestle cereals from Asda in West Bridgford, Nottingham, said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy.

Both Asda and Nestle have refused to take responsibility for the dangerous blunder.

Mrs Jackson, who lives in Gedling, Nottingham, with Beau, eight-year-old D'Arcy and her husband Alex, 45, said: 'Both my daughters thought it was a toy as it's got moving parts and could swivel.

'The end of the tag is really sharp like a pin, but it's got a sharp broken wire at the other end too. 'Kids thinking it's a toy are going to be spinning it round and they could get hurt.

'Neither Asda or Nestle are owning up to it, that's what annoys me.'

The full-time mother said she had called Nestle over concerns that such a sharp piece of metal could get past their quality tests.

The 34-year-old said it posed a major choking hazard to her daughter who had initially believed it was a free toy

'I just wondered how on earth it had got in there,' she added. 'I phoned them to express my concerns, but all they seemed to want was the box sent to them, and to reimburse me for the postage and have it forgotten about.

'I refused that initially as I thought it was too dangerous an item to just forget about it and brush it under the carpet.

'It just makes you wonder whether products are being checked thoroughly, especially for things that could be a choking hazard to children.'

But Nestle hit back, passing the blame back to Asda. 

A spokesman said the find was 'a security tag that retailers use on high value products.'

He added that all Nestle products had to pass through two sets of metal detectors and a security tag would have triggered 'massive alarm bells'.

The security tag, which was broken and sharp like a pin on one side, while the other had a jagged broken wire

'Our packing technology is highly automated and we have strict procedures in place including metal detection on the sealed products.

'We are confident that it did not leave out site with that tag in there.'

Nestle are now planning to launch an investigation liaising with the retailer.

However, Asda claimed that the tag had been found in a sealed box and therefore could only have been added in the manufacturing or packing process.

A spokesperson for the supermarket, where the cereal was purchased, said: 'We're at a loss to understand how this happened, as all products are packed and sealed at the manufacturers' 

'We're happy to assist Nestle with their investigation.'
