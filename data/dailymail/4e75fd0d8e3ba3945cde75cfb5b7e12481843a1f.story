Hull City look set to sign Norwich winger Robert Snodgrass after agreeing a fee with the club.

Tigers boss Steve Bruce has agreed to match the club-record fee that brought former loanee Jake Livermore to the club on Wednesday, with an initial £7million rising to £8million.

Scotland international Snodgrass, 26, who scored seven times in 34 games for the Canaries last season but could not prevent their relegation from the Barclays Premier League, has passed a medical at the KC Stadium

Deal: Hull City have agreed a £7million fee for Norwich and Scotland winger Robert Snodgrass

Determined: Snodgrass scored seven goals in 34 appearances for Norwich last season

International: Snodgrass has also scored three goals in 15 appearances for Scotland

He is eager to continue his top-flight career and is expected to undergo a medical and discuss personal terms in the next 24 hours.

Sunderland had been linked with a move for the versatile Snodgrass, but were reportedly unwilling to match the fee offered by Hull.

Should the former Leeds player become City's second summer signing it would provide further proof of the commitment shown by the club's controversial owner Assem Allam.

Although he has courted the fans' ire with unsuccessful attempts to rename the team Hull Tigers, as well as unveiling a new badge earlier this month, he has also agreed plenty of big-money signings.

Bruce has been allowed to break the transfer record several times since winning promotion, first with Tom Huddlestone's £5.25million capture a year ago, then in January when Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long came in for up to £7million each.

Livermore has already raised the bar again and Snodgrass would equal that mark.

Snodgrass has scored three goals in 15 internationals for Scotland.
