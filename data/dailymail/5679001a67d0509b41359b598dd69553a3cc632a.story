It seems that President Obama may be more of a football fan that an lover of film.

In his year end news conference on Friday, President Obama spent some time talking about the decision by Sony to not distribute their film The Interview following threats from a hacking group out of North Korea, and at one point called actors James Franco 'James Flacco.'

It would seem that he had confused the Hollywood heartthrob with Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco.

Flacco found the entire incident hysterical, writing soon after on Twitter; 'Welcome to the family, brother. @JamesFrancoTV.' 

Franco, meanwhile, has yet to respond.

President Barack Obama said on Friday that Sony Pictures Entertainment made a crucial mistake in self-censoring when it canceled the Christmas Day release of 'The Interview,' a satirical film that depicted the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un.

The decision followed a crippling cyber attack on Sony's servers that was launched by the North Korean regime. But critics have branded the film company as cowards for tucking tail and running when it was threatened.

Welcome: Friday afternoon, Flacco tweeted (above) to Franco 

'Sony's a corporation. It has suffered significant damage,' Obama told reporters in an end-of year press conference. 'There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced.'

But then he lowered the boom.

'Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake.'

'I wish they had spoken to me first,' he said.

'I would have told then, "Do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks".'
