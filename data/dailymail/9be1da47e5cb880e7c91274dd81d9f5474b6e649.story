Drivers often feel they need eyes in the back of their heads to see the growing number of bikes weaving their way through the traffic.

And cyclists often wonder whether the motorist in the car next to them has even spotted them.

Now Jaguar is attempting to address this problem – and the growing toll of deaths and injuries caused by collisions between cars and bikes.

The company is fitting a groundbreaking Bike Sense safety system into new Jaguars, Land Rovers and Range Rovers within two years.

The system produces a range of alerts to tell drivers if a cyclist is getting too close.

Using the traditional ‘ring ring’ of the bicycle bell, a warning will sound inside the car from the direction in which the bike is approaching. It will also ‘tap’ the driver on the right or left shoulder using a device that makes the seat cushion inflate and contract.

Even the door handles of the car will ‘buzz’ to prevent doors being opened into the path of bikes which are alongside.

The accelerator pedal will vibrate if moving the car would cause an accident. 

The new ‘Bike Sense’ safety system is to be fitted into new Jaguar, Land Rover and Range Rover cars within two years and aims to help reduce the toll of 19,000 cyclists killed or injured on British roads each year

The aim of the system, says Jaguar, is to ‘engage drivers’ natural instincts’ to help motorists be more alert to cyclists who may be pedalling too close to danger.

It will also help spot motor- cyclists – with a separate motorbike- horn warning.

Around 19,000 cyclists are killed or injured on UK roads each year. 

Motorists can easily risk hitting a cyclist undercutting on the left. 

Even minor accidents can lead to disputes, confrontation, personal injury claims and counter-claims.

Many cyclists now wear helmet-mounted cameras and film their journeys to use as evidence in the event of a collision – and some motorists are fitting cameras to their windscreens.

Regardless of who is at fault, it is usually the cyclist who comes off worst in any encounter with a car. And no driver wants a seriously or fatally injured cyclist on their conscience.

A Jaguar Land Rover spokesman said: ‘Sensors on the car will detect when another road user is approaching and identify it as bicycle or motorbike. 

'It will then make the driver aware of the potential hazard before the driver sees it.’ 

Intuitive: Even the accelerator pedal will vibrate if moving the car would cause an accident

The system will make the driver aware of the potential hazard before the driver sees it. But instead of using a generic warning symbol or sound, which takes time for the driver’s brain to process, the system uses lights and sounds that the driver instinctively associates with bicycles

The Jaguar spokesman said: ‘To help the driver understand where the bike is in relation to their car, the audio system will make it sound as if a bicycle bell or motorbike horn is coming through the speaker nearest the bike, so the driver immediately understands from which the direction the cyclist is coming’

But instead of using a generic warning symbol or sound, which takes time for the driver’s brain to process, the system uses lights and sounds that the driver instinctively associates with bicycles.

The spokesman explained the expanding and contracting seat: ‘If a bicycle or motorbike is coming up the road behind the car, Bike Sense will detect if it is overtaking or coming past the vehicle on the inside.

‘The top of the car seat will then extend to “tap” the driver on the left or right shoulder. The idea is that the driver will then instinctively look over that shoulder to identify the potential hazard.’

British Cycling’s campaign manager Martin Key said: ‘We would support any move by manufacturers to improve cyclists’ safety.’

Official statistics show that in the 12 months to June, the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured rose 10 per cent.

Silly or sensible? The new hat comes with a plate

Cycling helmets are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but one conceptual design, which is packed with technology, includes a  controversial extra – a licence plate.

The ‘Smart Hat’ is designed for ‘responsible cyclists’ and could include a visor showing safety information and a map, if it ever enters production.

It also features a licence plate on the rear of the futuristic design, in a bid to make identifying cyclists easier.

The concept, by Sydney-based designer Tony King, has aggravated some cyclists who think that Smart Hat is a silly idea.

 This is because the website claims: ‘Apart from safety considerations, an ID system would allow cyclists to share responsibility when interacting with vehicles and pedestrians.’

While it may not be popular with all cyclists, the idea has apparently got the green light from a local city council, which is keen on licensing cyclists, Daily Telegraph Australia reported.
