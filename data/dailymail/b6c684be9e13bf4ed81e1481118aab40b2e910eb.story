With 11 Barclays Premier League goals in 21 games, Aston Villa’s season review for 2014-15 is unlikely to extend to cinematic length. Ten minutes, roll credits.

To beef it up, a section could detail Pep Guardiola’s role.

It was a trip to observe Bayern Munich train under the Spanish innovator at the start of last month that convinced Paul Lambert to adopt a new, possession-based style for a team who can’t score goals, don’t create chances and serve up precious little entertainment.

It was an admirable ambition by Lambert. The result? ‘Too much passing, not enough purpose,’ one observer noted.

It is not like Villa were swashbuckling prior to Guardiola opening his Bavarian gates. But a barren run since Boxing Day, with Villa slipping to just three points above the relegation zone, has seen supporters chant for Lambert’s head.

Liverpool’s visit, to begin a vital sequence against Bournemouth, Arsenal and Chelsea, is hugely important. The atmosphere promises to be edgy.

Three supporter sites have called for those with tickets in the Holte End to leave their seats vacant for the first eight minutes to mark the number of full seasons Randy Lerner has owned the club. Watch for 82 minutes, is the idea, in recognition of the year Villa won the European Cup.

Few even dream those heady days can return but nor do supporters of one of England’s oldest and biggest clubs expect to witness such limp displays on and off the field. There is mounting frustration Villa cannot compete better in the transfer market or Premier League table.

‘We don’t like the word “protest”, it is more a demonstration,’ said Damian Dugdale of The Villa Blog. ‘We’d like to think this has positive connotations.

‘The demonstration suggests that if we continue down this path it might well be that the Holte End is half-empty.’

Former England and Villa manager Graham Taylor lives on the outskirts of Birmingham and has gauged the mood.

Former Villa manager Graham Taylor believes fans have become 'disaffected' with their football club

‘Supporters do come up to me to express their feelings and I must say I am surprised it has taken this long for such action to materialise,’ he said.

‘That is not to say I’m advocating Paul getting the sack at all, just the fans have seemed disaffected for quite a while.’

Much stems from Lerner’s loss of interest. Having shot for the stars with Martin O’Neill and missed, the American billionaire tightened the purse strings five years ago.

He enjoyed the top-six finishes and the 2010 League Cup final but grew tired of the ‘week-in, week-out battles’ football throws up.

Last May he announced his intention to sell up but has found no buyers, so the club finds itself in limbo. Paralysis is another interpretation.

Lambert’s job is secure so long as relegation is avoided. Lerner is reluctant to spend cash that will not maintain or enhance the price he wants for the club.

Chief executive Tom Fox was appointed last summer from a role at Arsenal, where he negotiated large-scale sponsorship deals worth millions.

Villa’s shirt sponsorship with Dafabet expires this summer. Back in August, Fox was targeting up to £14million per year for the next deal. It will be a big achievement if he gets that figure. Attendances are also falling. In the 2007-08 season, average crowds were 40,398, close to capacity. This season the figure is 32,239, with the lowest attendance in 15 years recorded when Southampton visited: 25,311.

Malaise from on high creeps into the stands.

What Villa followers crave is a sign of sunnier times to come, a reason to get aspirational.

Lambert’s team have scored just seven goals at home in the Premier League. FA Cup opponents Bournemouth have rippled the net more often in the city of Birmingham, following their 8-0 win at St Andrew’s.

Lambert, not unreasonably, points to Villa’s defence conceding just 23 goals, the fifth-lowest in the top flight. But the paucity of excitement up front is palpable. Following consecutive, tedious 0-0 draws against Sunderland and Crystal Palace, a third against lowly Blackpool in the FA Cup beckoned until Christian Benteke came up with the goods late on.

In the moments preceding his strike, home fans turned on Lambert for the first time. Their calls for him to be sacked found air again last time out in the 1-0 defeat by Leicester.

Mutiny in the stands threatens to emerge against Liverpool if Villa’s recently-acquired style continues to produce a desperate dearth of scoring opportunities.

The problem stems from hardly any of this ball retention being dangerous to opponents.

Promising winger Jack Grealish could be sent out on loan after failing to hold down a regular first team spot

At goal kicks, full backs drop to near the corner flags to receive passes from Brad Guzan and build attacks. But frequently moves stall when crossing the halfway line. Pace on the flanks is a huge issue, as is creativity through the middle. There is scarcely anything to get fans off their seats for the right reasons.

Hopes were high for winger Jack Grealish this season, a local lad. He enjoyed cameo roles that energised supporters but now finds himself out of the reckoning and looking for a loan move. No Harry Kane heroics here.

However, the mood in camp is said to still be positive. Benteke has not looked himself lately but, like Lambert, has a habit of turning in a performance when most needed.

Lambert has pleaded with fans not to go through with their walkout and a win against Liverpool would lift the gloom considerably. But deeper issues remain.

Until Lerner completes a sale or Lambert inspires a surge of form, Villa Park will continue to be cast as Bleak House.
