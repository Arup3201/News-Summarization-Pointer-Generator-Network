A baby boy who has spent his short life confined to a hospital bed battling a heart condition will enjoy his first Christmas at home after his body miraculously healed.

Ten-month-old Oscar Tasker has been allowed home to spend the day with his parents Lois and Jason and four siblings after making an incredible recovery.

His father Jason, 33, said: 'If someone had told me a few months ago we would be able to have Oscar home for his first Christmas I wouldn't have believed them.

Ten-month-old Oscar Tasker was born with a heart defect, which meant he has spent his entire life in hospital hooked up to an artificial heart

'There had been terrible times when we didn't think he would make it to see Christmas, so this is the best Christmas present any of us could have ever wished for.'

Oscar was born with a heart defect, which meant his arteries were the wrong way round.

Mr and Mrs Tasker were told their tiny son's only hope was a heart transplant.

Doctors kept Oscar alive using an artificial heart as his parents faced an agonising 100-day wait with their son's name on the transplant list.

But to the amazement of the medical team caring for Oscar, his heart healed itself.

Dr
 Richard Kirk, consultant paediatric cardiologist in charge of Oscar's 
care, believes time on the artificial heart gave Oscar's own heart time 
to rest and recover.

He said: 'Someone up above must be smiling down on Oscar as his heart has began to work on its own.'

Oscar's parents, Jason and Lois Tasker, left, were told their son's only hope was a heart transplant. He spent 100 days on the transplant list, visited by his anxious family, right, before his heart miraculously healed itself

Father-of-five Mr Tasker said: 'If someone had told me a few months ago we would be able to have Oscar home for his first Christmas I wouldn't have believed them. This is the best Christmas present any of us could have ever wished for'

Oscar was taken off the transplant list and later returned to Birmingham Children's Hospital for further treatment.

Mother-of-five Mrs Tasker, 28, said: 'We've got our family back. We can be a proper family with everyone together under one roof and I could not be happier.

'When Oscar was in hospital we had to get permission for everything, even if we wanted to take him out of the hospital ward, so I was astonished when the doctors said we could take our little boy home.

'Now we can do what we want with him when we want to take him out without asking anyone, it's like starting from scratch.'

The couple said they are delighted to have all their five children together under one roof for the first time to enjoy the festive period.
