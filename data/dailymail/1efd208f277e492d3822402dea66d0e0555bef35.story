The investigation into the massacre of a British family in the French Alps is to be extended to the victims' links to their native Iraq, officials revealed today.

The widening of the hunt for the killer of the Al-Hilli family comes after revelations of a possible connection to the former regime of Saddam Hussein.

Two French judges now want to travel to Baghdad to probe claims the deposed tyrant may have deposited £840,000 into a Swiss bank account in the name of victim Said al-Hilli's father.

They believe murdered Saad could have
been feuding over the money with other members of his family before the
multiple killings outside the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy.

Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 
47, and her mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, were all shot twice through the
head in their BMW parked in a remote Alpine beauty spot on September 5.

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three, also died in the massacre.

The Al-Hilli's daughter Zeinab, 
seven, was treated for a bullet wound and severe head injuries, while 
her sister Zeena, four, survived after hiding from the killer beneath 
her mother's body.

Annecy chief prosecutor Eric Maillaud
told France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper: 'Sooner or later we will 
have to go to Baghdad.

'The aim is to understand if we can make a link between the murders and the Iraqi origins of the victims.

'We want to know exactly what Said 
al-Hilli's father did professionally in Iraq, where he got his wealth 
from and why he left the country.

'We have made a formal request to 
officials in Iraq to meet them because there is no substitute for face 
to face contact with our fellow magistrates, but have so far we have had
no response.'

But the French Justice Ministry was 
unlikely to allow the trip to Iraq for 'safety and security reasons' in 
the middle-eastern state, the newspaper said.

Speculation: The rider of the motorbike has been firmly established as the prime suspect

Mr Maillaud also admitted last week that the six-month old crime may never be solved.

He told online newspaper The Local: 'Of course it is possible we will never find them, but it's too early to conclude that.

'The investigation is only six months
old, which in terms of police inquiries is a very short period of time.
It's out of the question that we will be thinking like that now.'

Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, was laid to rest in the same grave

Mr Maillaud is also set to meet British investigators in the Netherlands this week to explore ways to solve the murders.

Officials from Sweden and Italy will 
also attend the meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday at the headquarters of 
Eurojust in The Hague - the EU agency that promotes judicial 
co-operation across Europe.

Another theory still being explored 
by investigators is that the al-Hillis were murdered by a crazed loner 
who recently been released from a psychiatric hospital.

Other lines of inquiry focus on Mr 
al-Hilli's work as a satellite engineer, or that cyclist Mr Mollier, who
worked in a factory linked to the nuclear industry, was the main target
of the attack.
