Roy Keane says Paul Scholes snubbed interviews as a player because he 'couldn't be a****' and is only now doing media work for the money. 

It was widely believed that Scholes refused to do interviews and TV appearances during his playing career because he was shy. 

But since retiring in the summer of 2013, the former Manchester United midfielder has become a regular pundit on TV and in newspapers and is known for having forthright views.

Keane, who has also done media work since retiring, believes his former team-mate has changed his approach because of the money on offer. 

Keane told ShortList: 'People don't realise Scholesy could have done [TV appearances] at United, but he couldn't be a****. 

'People thought he was camera-shy; he just couldn't be bothered. 

'None of us liked doing interviews, but it was a responsibility of the dressing room, you shared the load. 

'Scholesy's too humble to do it? Well, he's f****** doing it now, isn't he? Maybe there's more money involved now.

'And I'd tell him this if he was sat here in front of me.'

Keane, now assistant manager at Aston Villa, says none of the players at United enjoyed doing interviews
