The body of a young mother has been discovered in the trunk of a car at a Chicago Greyhound bus station after police investigated the vehicle because it had not been moved for several days.

The discovery of Erin Ziemendorf, 30, of West Allis, Wisconsin, Sunday night led police to arrest her masseuse boyfriend, who is accused of snapping her neck.

Matthew McDowell, 40, gave himself up to police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Monday - saying that Ziemendorf had died during an argument after he pushed her to the ground.

Chicago police made the grisly find in the city's West Loop after they were called to investigate a car that had been left at a lot near the bus station for several days.

The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office ruled that she died of blunt trauma to the neck.

WISN-TV reports that McDowell, a licensed massage therapist, told police that he and Ziemendorf were fighting when she fell and accidentally died.

He then loaded her body into her car and drove it 100 miles to Chicago. He parked the car and took a bus back to Wisconsin.

Ziemendorf's
ex-husband and father of her child, Kevin Masullo, said he met McDowell
a few times and 'he seemed like a pretty nice guy.'

He said the pair were planning to take a trip to Hawaii together.

Mr Masullo said his ex-wife was 'the happiest person anybody has ever met.'

McDowell's profile on the Wisconsin massage studio where he works says that 'My clients tell me that my massages have lasting, restorative effects.

'I pride myself on being able to read the body and to sense blocked energy, and help release your bodyâ€™s natural healing abilities.'
