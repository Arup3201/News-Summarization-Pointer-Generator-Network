San Diego State University has suspended all fraternity activities after members allegedly threw eggs and waved sex toys at women protesting rape on campus.

The move by leaders of the school's Greek community comes just days after the University of Virginia also suspended its fraternities after a student said that she was gang raped at a frat house.

SDSU officials stepped in after male students from two different fraternities yelled obscenities and threw eggs at woman taking part in a Take Back the Night march. As part of the event, students march through campuses to protest sexual assaults.

Just 24 hours after the march, a student at the university reported that she was raped at a party near campus - the seventh such report made since September, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

Hours later, a 19-year-old woman reported that six men tried to pull her into their car near campus, but she managed to escape unharmed, the paper reported.

In light of the incidents, the university's InterFraternity Council announced on Tuesday that it is suspending all fraternity social activities until members undergo sexual assault prevention training, which will also teach them how to respond if they witness dangerous behavior.

'It was time to really address these issues,' J. Cole, student president, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. 'We take those allegations very seriously. We've seen this spike in sexual assault reports.'

University President Elliot Hirshman gave his support, saying in a statement: 'We must work as one community to create the substantive changes necessary to end sexual violence on our campus.' 

UVa shut down fraternity activities after Rolling Stone published a piece describing a woman's account of a brutal gang rape by seven men in September 2012 and what the magazine called a hidden culture of sexual violence.

The university's President Teresa Sullivan has asked police to investigate the alleged rape at the Phi Kappa Psi house, and the school has temporarily banned fraternity activities. 

The article says school administrators and students keep sexual assaults quiet. Sullivan, however, said the university takes sexual misconduct seriously.

Sullivan says the article includes details that weren't disclosed to university officials previously. 

In May, UVa. was listed among 55 schools across America facing a sexual abuse investigation under the Title IX law by the Education Department for the way they handle sexual abuse allegations by their students.

Governor Terry McAuliffe said he spoke with university leaders last week about the case and asked officials there to review all of the school's policies and procedures and bring in outside experts, if necessary.
