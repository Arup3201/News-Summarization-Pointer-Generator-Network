A couple shared a bittersweet moment this morning when they welcomed the birth of their son Shane, who lived just a few hours before dying in their arms from a rare terminal condition.

Jenna Gassew and Dan Haley from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, were devastated when, 13 weeks into the pregnancy, their baby-to-be was diagnosed with a neural tube defect called anencephaly, which is the absence of part of the brain and skull.

Despite Shane's slim chances of survival, the devout Catholics decided to make the most of the pregnancy and birth, even compiling a 'bucket list' of activities to complete while he was still in the womb.

Tragic: Jenna Gassew and Dan Haley from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, shared a bittersweet moment this morning when they welcomed their son Shane, who lived just a few hours before dying in their arms

Illness: 13 weeks into Jenna's pregnancy, Shane baby-to-be was diagnosed with a neural tube defect called anencephaly, which is the absence of part of the brain and skull

Miraculous: Shane Michael Haley was born on Thursday morning, and his family were all there to meet him and witness him being baptized into the Catholic faith. Four hours after his birth, he died in his mother's arms

Shane Michael Haley was born early on Thursday morning, and his family members were all there to meet him and witness him being baptized into the Catholic faith.

But at 6:15am Thursday morning, just four hours after his birth, Shane died 'peacefully in his mother's arms,' according to a post on Facebook.

'Shane spent his entire life in the arms of people that loved him unconditionally, and I don't think you could ask for a more beautiful life then that,' reads the tragic post. 

'He is home now with the Lord and will forever be our little miracle!'

Proud parents: Even after learning that Shane would likely not survive very long, Dan and Jenna continued to prepare for his birth and celebrate his existence

Have hope: 'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing,' Dan wrote on Facebook prior to Shane's birth

Adventures: The couple even compiled a 'bucket list' of activities to complete while he was still in the womb

The couple shared pictures of Shane's brief life, including one of him being cradled in his mother's arms.

In another photo, Shane is surrounded with stuffed animals and blankets, his tiny hands clutching onto a holy Rosary.

Babies born with anencephaly, which occurs in one or two of every 10,000 births, have a life expectancy of a few hours to a few days, with a few cases where children have survived for more than a year.

For tragic Shane, life was just a few hours, but his parents made sure to celebrate him as much as possible while they could.

Arts and crafts: They painted Jenna's baby bump to look like a Jack-o'-lantern, knowing that Shane might never live to celebrate Halloween

Support: The couple documented all their adventures on a Facebook page, Prayers For Shane, where friends were invited to share their support and blessings. It has more than 700,000 'likes'

Milestones: Jenna celebrated her first Mother's Day while still pregnant with Shane

Making the most: 'We knew that our time with our son could be very limited, so we wanted to make the most of the time that we had with him,' says Dan

As part of their bucket list before Shane was born, Dan and Jenna, who are in their early 20s, took him to baseball games, brought him on a tour of New York City and painted Jenna's baby bump to look like a Jack-o'-lantern.

Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. 

During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus.

This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp.

Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. 

They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer.

The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. 

'We are asking for your prayers and support and that God grants us as much time as possible with our beautiful son,' reads the page.

The couple documented all their adventures on a Facebook page, Prayers For Shane, where friends were invited to share their support and blessings. It has more than 700,000 'likes'.

'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing. Follow us through our various adventures as we take Shane to some of our favorite childhood places.'

Thousands of people pored out support for Jenna and Dan throughout the pregnancy and birth.

One person wrote: 'Please read Psalm 139 - Shane is being knit together in your womb and God makes no mistakes. We were created to glorify Him. Little Shane is doing that. He's being used to cause many people to pray!!!'

Others describe instances in which babies have miraculously lived for years despite being born with terminal defects.

Dan announced Shane's birth via the Facebook page, writing: 'Baby Shane is here!! .. Mom and Baby are doing well! .. more details and pictures to come!'

The post has had more than 115,000 'likes'.

Even though Dan and Jenna were not able to share much time with Shane, it's clear they're happy to have made so many memories with him.

Family matters: The new parents pose with their newborn son after his birth this morning

Paying tribute: Dan wrote on Facebook: 'He is home now with the Lord and will forever be our little miracle!'

'Most families wait until their baby is born to start making memories and traveling to places with them,' Dan told ABC 13 in September.

'We understood what it was and knew that our time with our son could be very limited, so we wanted to make the most of the time that we had with him.'
