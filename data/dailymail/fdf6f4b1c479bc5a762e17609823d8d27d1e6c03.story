The Duchess of Cambridge has turned to scented candles in her battle with morning sickness.

Kate is said to have filled her Kensington Palace home with the Contentment candle, made with the oils of the rare South African buchu plant.

The powerful scent is believed to help the Duchess overcome waves of nausea and the aroma is now infusing the Royal residence.

Remedy: Kate has turned to scented candles in her efforts to combat extreme morning sickness

In South Africa, buchu leaves  are used as a remedy for gastrointestinal ailments. The plant gives off a scent similar to blackcurrant.

Kate was admitted to hospital in December suffering from an extreme form of morning sickness.

Although her condition has now improved, the Duchess has still been struggling to overcome her symptoms.

She has already turned to natural food remedies, including Turkish figs and lavender biscuits sent to her by the Royal Family.

One scent in which the candle, by Neom Organics, is available is English Lavender, Sweet Basil and Jasmine.

The candles are expected to go on sale in the UK later this month, costing £39.50 each.

They are made from essential oils and vegetable wax and work as 'aromatherapeutic treatments', the company says on its website.

It recommends burning a candle for two to four hours to harness its 'powerful holistic' effects.
