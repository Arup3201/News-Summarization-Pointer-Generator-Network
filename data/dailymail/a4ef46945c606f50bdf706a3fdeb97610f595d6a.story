She's the bombshell from Brazil whose stunning looks have made her into a star but it seems Adriana Lima might have missed her true calling.

Fellow Victoria's Secret models have revealed that the 33-year-old is a 'true athlete' and that the secret of her incredible body is boxing.

'Adriana is pretty amazing,' said Alessandra Ambrosio, 33. 'She does all of that boxing that I've never done before and I'm scared to even try — what I do is more mild and better suited for girls, but she does what the athletes do. It's really tough.'

The model made the comment during an interview with Fashionista.com's Alyssa Vingan at a New York event in aid of cycling charity, Pelotonia.

And it seems Ambrosio isn't the only one in awe of Lima's tough approach to getting fit for catwalk appearances.

25-year-old Martha Hunt, a recent addition to the Victoria's Secret stable, also spoke of her admiration for Lima's butt-kicking workouts and revealed that the Brazilian model 'gets better' every year.

'She's a born athlete,' revealed Hunt, 'and she gets better and better every year — she's not human!'

Like the rest of the Victoria's Secret girls, Hunt is a fan of regular workouts although unlike Lima, confines herself to personal training sessions, yoga, pilates and ballet.

One model who is happy to join Lima in the boxing ring is Lais Ribero, 25, from Brazil, who boxes five times a week, although she says taking on Lima in the ring is a no go.

'No, I don't want to,' said the 23-year-old when asked if she'd like to take her compatriot on. 'Oh my gosh, she just doesn't stop. I 
can't even talk about her.'
