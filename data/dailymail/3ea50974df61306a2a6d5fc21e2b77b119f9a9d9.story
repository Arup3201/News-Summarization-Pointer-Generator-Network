Tiger Woods was in attendance as his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn produced a far from toothless display on the ski slopes in Italy on Monday.

The former world No 1 golfer, widely regarded as one of the best ever to play the game, was wrapped up in a scarf and hat as he witnessed Vonn achieve her 63rd World Cup win, but he was missing one of his front teeth.

Mark Steinberg, his agent at Excel Sports, explained the missing tooth in an email. He says during a crush of photographers at the awards podium, a media member with a shoulder-mounted video surged toward the stage, turned and hit Woods in the mouth. That's what knocked out the tooth.

He did not say when Woods would have it replaced. Golf's biggest star returns to competition next week in Phoenix, and his smile is sure to produce a stream of shutters from the cameras.

Woods endured an injury-plagued 2014 season, in which he only played nine tournaments, but is back fit and will begin 2015 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open at the end of January.

For now, though, he is with Vonn in Italy as she made history by settig a new record for women's alpine skiing World Cup wins in the super-G at Cortia d'Ampezzo.

As Woods watched on, photographers caught a glimpse of what looks like a gap where a  front-left tooth should be.

On the slopes, Vonn finished 0.85 seconds ahead of Austria's Anna Fenninger, with Liechenstein's Tina Weirather in third.

Vonn had equalled the 35-year-old win record set by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell by winning the World Cup downhill race at the same venue on Sunday.

The four-times overall World Cup winner and 2010 Olympic champion returned this season after a year out with knee injuries sustained in a crash at the 2013 World Championships in Schladming.

She was ruled out of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi but has vowed to keep competing for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games.
