The walls were closing in on Blackpool’s Karl Oyston on Tuesday evening after club president Valeri Belokon called for him to resign and shirt sponsors Wonga branded his behaviour ‘unacceptable’.

A flurry of abusive text messages sent by the chairman to supporters - in which he labelled one a ‘retard’ and told him to ‘enjoy his special needs day out’ - have caused uproar throughout the world of football after being published on Sunday.

In the appalling exchanges, seen by Sportsmail, Oyston mocked a fan as an ‘intellectual cripple’ and called him a ‘p****’.

There has been a strong defiance to his actions as both Belokon and Wonga condemned the Seasiders’ chief on the same day.

In a statement Wonga - whose sponsorship at Bloomfield Road is up at the end of the season - said: ‘The comments were unacceptable, something we’ll be making clear to the club.’

That came just hours after Belokon, who has designs of buying Blackpool, said Oyston must stand down as chairman.

The Latvian millionaire stated that Oyston isn’t fit to remain in charge and reiterated that he does possess the money to buy the controlling family out.

‘I would like that he goes as chairman. I will write to Karl Oyston that maybe he should go,’ Belokon told the BBC.

‘I would like to invite Blackpool fans to write and sign an open letter for exclusion of such an attitude towards football fans.’

Oyston was left embarrassed at the weekend after a string of abhorrent messages he sent to disgruntled fans, who had found his number on social media, became public knowledge.

Supporter Steve Smith was branded a ‘retard’ and ‘intellectual cripple’ by Oyston, whose beleaguered side lost 6-1 at home against Bournemouth on Saturday and are bottom of the Championship.

One rant from Oyston, who had abuse hurled at him as well, read: ‘Stop texting f******, you shouldn’t have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium.

‘You are banned because I think you are a p****.

‘Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.’

Oyston apologised on Monday, saying in a statement: ‘I would like to unreservedly apologise for any offence or distress caused by my text responses reported in the media recently.’

Oyston had also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: ‘I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission’.

Smith wants the FA and Football League to take action.

‘The texts are disgusting, politically incorrect and show that Karl needs to be put through the fit and proper person’s test. Let’s not forget he is supposed to be a figurehead in football,’ he said.

‘His position is untenable. He’s been untouchable for years and the FA haven’t done anything about his actions.’

Ismail Kaji, who has a learning disability and works for the charity Mencap, said that the ‘disgusting’ language made him ‘sick’.

‘I would feel ashamed however to support any football club that has a chairman who uses such disgusting language to people with a disability,’ he said.

‘This language is just as bad as using racist or homophobic words. There is no difference and it makes me sick.’

Sportsmail contacted Blackpool for comment on Tuesday afternoon and are awaiting response.
