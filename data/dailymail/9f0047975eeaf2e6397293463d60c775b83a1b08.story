Former French president Jacques Chirac had innumerable mistresses and was allegedly nicknamed Mr Three Minutes, shower included, according to a new book.

Bernadette Chirac would ask her husband whether he would be 'dining here this evening', to which he would reply 'you're getting on my nerves', before going to meet other women, it has been revealed.

And it seems the former first lady's patience has now run out, if her recent outspoken comments are anything to go by.

The book, entitled Les Chirac, Les Secrets d'un Clan, is written by Beatrice Gurrey, a political journalist at French newspaper Le Monde. 

Mr Chirac, now 81, suffers from poor health and memory loss, following a stroke while he was still the country's president in 2005. His condition means he is unaware he is unwell.

He was known for his colourful personal life, and in the 1980s, when he was mayor of Paris, he ordered the council to buy a coach fitted out with a bedroom so he could meet his lovers while carrying out official engagements, according to The Times.

The book, released this month, claims the former president had an affair with political correspondent Jacqueline Chabrido, but the relationship was ended by senior members of his party who were worried it would affect his career.

The author said years of frustration for Mrs Chirac are now coming to the fore.

She denounced Alain Juppé, Mr Chirac's former protégé and praised Nicolas Sarkozy, whom her husband hates, according to The Times.

She dug the knife in further when commenting on the terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, blaming her husband for abandoning boarder controls, stating: 'We let them through'.
