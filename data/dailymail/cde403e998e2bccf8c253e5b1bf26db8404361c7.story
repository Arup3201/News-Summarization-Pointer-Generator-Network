The Dallas Cowboys this afternoon bowed their heads in a moment of silence for killed teammate Jerry Brown - the second weekend in a row that an NFL game has been preceded by tragedy.

Brown was killed in a car crash in Texas on early Saturday morning, a week after Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend and committed suicide. 

Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Josh Brent was due to appear at a court hearing in Irving on Sunday morning, a day after he was charged with intoxication manslaughter in connection with the accident

Second tragedy: Dallas Cowboys players hang their heads during a moment of silence today honoring teammate Jerry Brown who was killed in an accident last night. Lineman Josh Brent has been charged with DUI manslaughter

Deceased: Jerry Brown (in a 2012 file photo) died in the accident at 2:20 a.m. on Dec. 7, 2012, in the Dallas suburb of Irving

Irving police said the accident 
happened about 2:20 a.m. Saturday, hours before Brent was to be on a 
team flight to Cincinnati. He was reportedly speeding and hit a kerb, 
flipping the car

Before the game, the Bengals held a 
moment of silence before the national anthem. Most Cowboys bowed their 
heads, and Dallas quarterback Tony Romo and several other players had 
their hands over their hearts.

On Fox's NFL Sunday show, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team had focused on Brown's death in the 'last few hours.' He didn't mention Brent.

'First of all we all know, but we remind ourselves that there is something more important than football, and this is life, and certainly the lost life of Jerry,' Jones said on the TV show. 'On the other hand, they know the best way they can honor Jerry, because he was such a hard worker, so conscientious and enthusiastic about his career.'

Release: Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Joshua Brent, accused behind the fatal crash, is escorted by his attorney after his released from the Irving City Jail on Saturday after posting a $500,000 bond

Best friends: Brent is charged with intoxication manslaughter that resulted in the death of his passenger and teammate whom he's since called his best friend

Reality check: Brent's charge of intoxication manslaughter is a second-degree felony that's punishable by two to 20 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000

Irving police spokesman John 
Argumaniz said Saturday that the 25-year-old Brown - a practice-squad 
linebacker who also was Brent's teammate for three seasons at the 
University of Illinois - was found unresponsive at the scene and 
pronounced dead at a hospital.

'I am devastated and filled with 
grief,' Brent said in a statement released Saturday to multiple media 
outlets by agent Peter Schaffer. 'Filled with grief for the loss of my 
close friend and teammate, Jerry Brown. I am also grief-stricken for his
family, friends and all who were blessed enough to have known him.

'I will live with this horrific and 
tragic loss every day for the rest of my life. My prayers are with his 
family, our teammates and his friends at this time.'

It marked the second straight week the NFL found itself dealing with a tragedy right before gameday.

Last Saturday, Kansas City Chiefs 
linebacker Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend before killing 
himself in front of his coach and general manager. The 25-year-old 
Belcher shot himself in the parking lot at the team's practice complex 
at Arrowhead Stadium.

Crash: Tire skid marks are seen leaving the road where the car driven by Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent crashed on Saturday morning. His teammate Jerry Brown was killed in the accident

Officers conducted a field sobriety 
test on Brent and arrested him on suspicion of driving while 
intoxicated, Argumaniz said. The charge, a second-degree felony 
punishable by two to 20 years in prison, was upgraded after Brown was 
pronounced dead.

In February 2009, Brent was arrested 
in February 2009 near the Illinois campus for driving under the 
influence, driving on a suspended license and speeding, according to 
Champaign County, Ill., court records.

In June 2009, Brent pleaded guilty to
DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 
hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000. As part of his 
plea deal, prosecutors dropped one count of aggravated DUI/no valid 
driver's license. Brent successfully completed his probation in July 
2011, court records show.

Dallas Cowboys' Josh Price- Brent (pictured in Jan. 2012) is facing an intoxication manslaughter charge after a one-vehicle accident that killed linebacker Jerry Brown, a member of the team's practice squad

Brent, a nose guard, has played in 
all 12 games this season and played a bigger role than expected with 
starter Jay Ratliff battling injuries. He has 35 tackles and 1 1/2 sacks
and might have started Sunday against the Bengals because Ratliff is 
out with a groin injury.

The Cowboys signed Brown to their 
practice squad Oct. 24, but he hasn't been on the active roster. He was 
released from the Colts' practice squad Oct. 20. Brown played in one 
game for the Colts, a loss to the New York Jets on Oct. 14.

'We are deeply saddened by the news of this accident and the passing of Jerry Brown,' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said in a statement yesterday.

'At this time, our hearts and prayers and deepest sympathies are with the members of Jerry's family and all of those who knew him and loved him.'

Irving Police Department Public Information Officer John Argumaniz says Jerry Brown, 25, was found unresponsive at the scene and pronounced dead at a hospital

Charges: Irving Police Department Public Information Officer John Argumaniz (at a press conference on Wednesday) said Price- Brent is facing an intoxication manslaughter charge

According to the Dallas Morning News, Brown joined the team in October after he had been with the Indianapolis Colts, where he rotated from the practice squad and the regular roster. 

The deceased was originally from St. Louis. He had been a defensive lineman at the University of Illinois, where  Price- Brent had been his teammate.

According to local reports, Price-Brent had been jailed for misdemeanor DUI when he was a student-athlete at the University of Illinois in 2009.

He was given two years of probation and 60 days in jail as part of a plea deal for the at incident.

'Sad news for the Illini #Family today,' Illinois coach Tim Beckman tweeted. 'Jerry Brown, former Illini and current NFL player has passed away. Keep him in your prayers.'

Scene of the crime: Tire ruts mark the area where Brent lost control of the car

Cowboys: In 2003, Cowboys player Dwayne Goodrich, was involved in a hit-and-run accident in which two people were killed

The Cowboys were preparing to fly to Cincinnati on Saturday for a Sunday game against the 
Bengals, when the team was told of the news, according to ESPN.

The players were told on the plane just 
before takeoff of what happened after non-team personnel were asked to 
go outside.

This marks a second time that a Cowboys player has been involved in a fatal car crash.

In 2003, Dwayne Goodrich, a second-round pick in 2000, was involved in a hit-and-run accident in which two people were killed.

Goodrich was convicted in 2013 of two counts of criminally negligent homicide and was released from prison in October 2011.
