Early release: Carle Steele served just 18 weeks in jail

A fly-tipper who illegally dumped more than a million used tyres – earning £2.5million in the process – has been told by a court to pay back just £122.

The derisory sum was said to be the only ‘available asset’ left in a bank account linked to Carl Steele’s now defunct company, FCM Logistics (Tyres).

Steele, 34, had left a ‘trail of destruction’ on the countryside by renting land and blighting it by storing hundreds of thousands of tyres without permission.

He made his fortune through 
undercutting business rivals who would have had to pay a charge of 80p 
per tyre to use official waste sites.  

When the 34-year-old was caught and jailed for 15 months in November, environmental campaigners celebrated.

But their joy was short-lived when 
last month the businessman – dubbed the Million Tyre Man – was released 
less than a third of the way into his sentence.

Now they have been further angered by the proceeds-of-crime hearing.

Steele was even given six months to pay the £122 by Lincoln Crown Court.

He refused to comment when he left the
hearing, but a friend said afterwards: ‘He’s happy and relieved. It is a
bit of a result but he’s served his time and hasn’t got any money to 
give them. What else do they want?’

Landscape blighted: Steele dumped more than a million tyres

Victims, however, were shocked by what they saw as soft justice.

Peter Steward, a member of Crouch 
Conservation Trust, which retrieved fly-tipped tyres from the River 
Crouch in Essex, criticised the ruling.

‘It’s absolutely ridiculous they can only get such a small amount of money back.

‘They need to investigate it further 
to find out where all the money has gone. Dumping tyres, whether it’s in
a river or on land, causes major pollution.’

Steele lives in a four-bedroom 
farmhouse on a sprawling rural site in Deeping St Nicholas, 
Lincolnshire, where his parents also reside. He is understood to drive a
white van.

Between October 2009 and January 2010 
he hired land in five counties – Essex, Norfolk, Yorkshire, 
Worcestershire and Lincolnshire – and used the spots to store the tyres.

One site at Full Sutton Airfield, 
Yorkshire, where more than 125,000 were left, drains into a tributary of
the River Derwent, which is a source of drinking water. Despite 
warnings from the Environment Agency on 20 occasions, Steele failed to 
register the operation. When legal action began against him he simply 
rented new sites.

Environment Agency officials found 
3,000 tyres at the Lincolnshire site and said the number grew to 400,000
as their investigations continued. Four other sites, with a further 
800,000 tyres, were found later.

Landowners have been left a bill of £260,000 to clear the mess.

Steele admitted six charges relating 
to the illegal storage and treatment of waste and was jailed at Lincoln 
Crown Court on November 7. His business had a turnover of £2,540,768.

The judge at Lincoln Crown Court could only order Carl Steele to hand over £122

Judge Sean Morris said at the time: 
‘You have left a trail of destruction for other people to pick up. I am 
quite satisfied that your motive was the long-term prospect of making 
big money.’

Steele was set free on March 15 on licence under the early release programme.

The Environment Agency refused to 
speculate yesterday as to whether Steele had moved his proceeds abroad. 
But it insisted it had a confiscation order for £2.5million, which would
apply to any future money he came into.

A spokesman said: ‘Having proven his 
guilt, we took him to court again to take away his illegal profits. The 
£2.5million confiscation order can be revisited in the future.’
