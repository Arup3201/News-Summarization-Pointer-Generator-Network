Jason Zadrozny, 34, a Lib Dem election candidate and councillor, has been suspended  after being quizzed over historic child sex allegations

A would-be Liberal Democrat MP has been suspended by the party and withdrawn his candidacy after being questioned by police over historic child sex allegations.

Jason Zadrozny, who was due to stand as an MP in the marginal Ashfield seat, was questioned by officers yesterday over allegations relating to the abuse of a 16-year-old boy.

Today Mr Zadrozny issued a statement saying he 'vehemently' denies the allegations and was withdrawing from the general election while he fights to clear his name.

He said: 'I am today withdrawing my candidacy as a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Ashfield and Eastwood Constituency.

'Yesterday I was questioned by Nottinghamshire Police about historic allegations, some of which are over ten years old.

'I am in full cooperation with the police and vehemently refute the allegations.

'I have spent the last ten years championing the cause of the Liberal Democrats both locally and nationally and I do not want this allegation to detract from the real issues facing local residents in the upcoming elections.

'Therefore I will step down with immediate effect as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate to spend my time clearing my name.'

Nottinghamshire police said: 'A man has been bailed following an investigation in historic sexual offences.

'The 34-year-old was arrested yesterday and questioned about an allegation of gross indecency with a male under 16 between September 2003 and April 2004, sexual activity with a child between May 2004 and December 2007 and an allegation of meeting a child under 16 following sexual grooming from May 2004 and December 2007.'

Officers said all the offences had been committed against one victim. Mr Zadrozny has been bailed until June.

Mr Zadrozny is an experienced Lib Dem campaigner and came within a narrow margin of winning the Ashfield seat at the last general election.

According to news reports from the time, Mr Zadrozny secured a swing of 17 per cent from Labour, but was ultimately defeated by a margin of just 192 votes.

He lost to TV journalist Gloria De Piero, who had taken over the seat from disgraced former MP Geoff Hoon, who was caught up in the expenses scandal of 2009. 

Mr Zadrozny, who serves as an Ashfield District and Nottinghamshire County Councillor for Sutton North, was selected to fight the seat back in September 2013.

At the time, Simon Hughes, deputy of the Liberal Democrats, said there was 'nobody better' to fight for the Ashfield seat.

This evening Mr Zadrozny's Twitter feed had been deactivated, and his profile page on the Lib Dem's website deactivated.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of a police investigation in Ashfield. The party has immediately suspended the party's parliamentary candidate pending the outcome of a police investigation.

'We are unable to make any further comment at this stage.' 

Mr Zadrozny's suspension is just the latest blow to hit political parties in the rundown to May's hotly-contested general election.

Mr Zadronzy's suspension is just the latest blow for the major parties heading into this May's general election. Tory MP Aidan Burley, who represented Cannock Chase, stood down today after a series of scandals

Ukip MEP and parliamentary hopeful Janice Atkinson was expelled from Ukip earlier this week after claims her assistant was filmed trying to cheat expenses

Earlier this week Ukip expelled one of its most prominent MEPs, and general election candidate for Folkestone and Hythe, after she was allegedly caught fiddling expenses.

Janice Atkinson and her assistant Christine Hewitt were kicked out of the party after Ms Hewitt was reportedly filmed trying to claim £3,150 for a drinks party that actually cost £950.

Just a day later Tim Wilson, who was due to stand for MP in South Northamptonshire, quit the party, saying leader Nigel Farage had failed to condemn another of his MEPs who compared a Muslim politician to terrorist Abu Hamza.

Earlier today a Tory MP mired in scandal also quit parliament after just five years, departing with a whinging speech about not being paid enough, and a swipe at 'rude' constituents.

Aidan Burley, who represented Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was once caught being the best man at a Nazi-themed stag do, and also described the Olympic opening ceremony as 'leftie multicultural crap'.
