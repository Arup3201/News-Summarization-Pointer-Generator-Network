A functioning man-made leaf that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, just like natural leaves, has been created by an art graduate.

The new material could provide a steady source of oxygen for humans on long missions in space and even help us colonise new planets.

Julian Melchiorri claims that the leaves could also transform life on Earth as we know it, because buildings could be clad with the material to oxygenate homes and polluted urban areas.

You better beleaf it: A graduate has invented a man-made biological leaf (pictured) that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, just like natural leaves do on Earth. He thinks the material could be used in space exploration, the colonising of planets and to clad buildings back on Earth

Julian Melchiorri claims that the leaves could facilitate long-distance space travel by providing oxygen on future space craft.

They could be dumped on planets that humans will colonise, as 'real' plants can't grow in zero gravity. But the man-made leaves also need water to perform photosynthesis.

The leaves could be used in interior design on Earth and the designer has already made lightshade using the material, which could oxygenate as well as decorate rooms.

He thinks the leaves could be used to clad buildings and even funnel the oxygen produced inside structures.

The Royal College of Art graduate told Dezeen that Nasa is researching ways to ensure a supply of oxygen over long journeys so that people can live in space, but that plants don’t grow in zero gravity.

‘This material could allow us to explore space much further than we can now,’ he said.

Mr Melchiorri, who lives in London, was working on his leaf while on the RCA’s Innovation Design Engineering Course and collaborated with scientists at Tufts University silk lab in Massachusetts to engineer the material.

It is made up of chloroplasts from plant cells  that are suspended in a web of silk protein. The protein is extracted from natural silk fibres.

‘This material has amazing properties of stabilising molecules,’ he explained in a video.

Mr Melchiorri claims that he has made the 'first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does.'

But just like real leaves, the new material needs a small amount of fresh water and light to produce oxygen, which still needs to be discovered on planets for humans to call home.

Mr Melchiorri says that his material consumes very little energy and as a result he thinks it could be incorporated into modern buildings, to absorb carbon dioxide.

It could be used to clad facades, ventilation systems, he said. ‘You can absorb air from outside, pass it through these biological filters and then bring oxygenated air inside.’

He has so far created lampshades made from the material, which produce oxygen while helping to light up a home.

The project was showcased as part of Dezeen and Mini Frontiers.
