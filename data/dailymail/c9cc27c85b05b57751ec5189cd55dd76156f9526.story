A teenage boy playing with a stolen gun accidentally shot and killed his 12-year-old friend then, moments later committed suicide when he realized what he had done, authorities in Utah have revealed.

The double tragedy in November 2013 rocked the city of South Jordan, Utah, where both boys lived and attended school.

Authorities say Dayton Gessell, 15, and Taylor Wheeler, 12, were in a friend's basement with three other boys playing with guns that one of the teens had stolen from a relative, the Deseret News reports.

The killings occurred in a quiet housing development, in the basement of this home, which is across the street from a park

Neither Gessell or Wheeler lived at the house, but two of the boys with them did.  

The teens were pointing the weapons at each other when Gessell's gun went off accidentally, killing Wheeler. 

Gessell then turned the gun on himself and fired, committing suicide.  

'We believe that Dayton intentionally shot himself as a result of the stressful situation of what just happened,' South Jordan police Officer Sam Winkler told the Deseret News.  

Police say it took nearly a year for detectives to determine exactly what transpired in the basement.

Wheeler's mother described her son as 'a smile and a hug.' His death shocked the community

Gessell's parents said he was a 'lover and a peacekeeper'

After the shootings, the boys ran outside and flagged down and off-duty officer. Police arrived to find both boys dead in the basement. 

Another boy and the owner of the home were upstairs and unaware of what was happening in the basement, police say. 

The teen who stole the guns, who was 16 at the time, was arrested and charged as a juvenile. His name was not released.

Wheeler's mother described her son as 'a smile and a hug.'

Gessell's family said he was 'truly was a lover and a peacekeeper... He always had a kind word and wisdom beyond his years.'
