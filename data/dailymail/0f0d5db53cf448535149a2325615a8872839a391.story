Thieves stole an undertaker's van loaded with 12 full coffins on its way to the crematorium, sparking a week-long hunt.

The unmarked white van was hijacked in Berlin, Germany, and driven over the border to Krolikow in Poland, where it was found stashed in woodland with the caskets intact.

Two men aged 25 and 27 have been arrested and police are searching for two more suspects called Maks Skibicki, 22, and 34-year-old Tomasz Sporny - who they believe may have organised the crime.

Police spokeswoman Hanna Wachowiak explained: 'We don't think the thieves had any idea what was in the van.

'But once they had it, they just didn't know what to do with them.'

The gang stole two other Mercedes vehicles on the same weekend and police offered 5,000 zlotys (almost £1,000) to anyone who could trace the criminals.

The coffins contained the bodies of eight Berliners, and four dead people from Brandenburg.

It was being taken from a funeral parlour in Brandenburg to a crematorium in Meissen, Saxony.

Last month another theft was given a macabre twist when a teenage burglar raiding a chapel attempted to hide next to a dead body in a coffin.

Thief Kyle Kennelly, 18, ransacked the 150-year-old chapel in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, where the corpse was lying in rest the night before the funeral.

But the burglar was caught in the act when the undertaker Robert Protheroe arrived to begin his preparations for the service - and clambered into a casket to hide next to a corpse.
