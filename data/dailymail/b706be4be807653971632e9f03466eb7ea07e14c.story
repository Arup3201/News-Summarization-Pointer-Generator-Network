U.S. airstrikes against the little known Khorasan terror group have failed to stop 'imminent' attacks on Western targets because key members scattered amid news reports of their existence.

Many of the Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists are believed to have fled their bases near the Syrian city of Aleppo several days before the strikes, taking with them the dangerous explosives with which they are said to be plotting to blow up planes over Europe and the United States.

As a result, the bombing raid managed to kill 'only one or two' key figures, with the remaining 1,000 Khorasan members continuing plans to attack the West, according to U.S. intelligence officials.

The existence of the Khorasan group only emerged in the weeks before the September 22 U.S. air force bombing raid, which took place on the same night as a coalition of American and Arab warplanes carried out their first strikes on Islamic State targets inside Syria.

Target: The airstrikes on September 22 targeted Khorasan's facilities - such as training camps and explosivies and communications facilities - but failed to kill more than 'one or two' key figures

Destroyed: However officials say many suspected leaders and members of the Khorasan Group managed to escape the bombings - and take high-tech explosive devices with them

On September 22, the U.S. fired 46 cruise missiles at eight locations linked to the Khorasan group, although their limited effectiveness has now been fully revealed.

Among the Khorasan fighters who survived the airstrikes is a French-born jihadist who fought in Afghanistan and has a military prowess that is of great concern to U.S. intelligence officials.

One of the U.S. missiles went awry and killed a dozen civilians in the village of Kfar Derian, according to Mohammed Abu Omar, an activist in the northern province of Idlib. 

The U.S. military says it has not confirmed any civilian casualties. 

The failure of the attack on Khorasan is partly the result of a hazy intelligence picture that also has bedeviled the air campaign against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq.

The U.S. lacks the networks of bases, spies and ground-based technology it had in place during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, officials say, or even the network of human sources it developed in Pakistan and Yemen. 

'The strikes were certainly effective in setting back the Khorasan Group, but no one thinks they were a permanent solution or a death blow to the threats that come from this cell,' said Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. 

Bombed: The targets of the strikes were fighters from the Khorasan Group, which is how the U.S. government refers to a cell led by Al Qaeda veterans who had relocated to Syria from Afghanistan-Pakistan

The existence of Khorasan became public only weeks before the airstrikes, prompting a flurry of news reports, but U.S. officials claim to have been tracking the militants for up to two years.

Officials said that among the group's top brass are a few dozen Al Qaeda members, some of whom are long-sought militants connected to the fighting in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the last decade.

Khorasan is said to be working closely with Nusra Front - a terror group that has acted as Al Qaeda official presence in Syria during the ongoing civil war that has ravaged the country of the past three years. 

The details were provided by several current and former U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity about the group because they were not authorized to discuss classified information.

In public, U.S. officials have offered seemingly contradictory assessments of the attacks on the Khorasan group. 

General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the strikes disrupted the group's plotting, but he did not know for how long. 

FBI Director James Comey said he believed the plots had not been disrupted and that the group remains a threat to the U.S. Other intelligence officials embraced Comey's view.

Terrorist group ISIS may be considering using Ebola as a suicide bio-weapon against the West, according to a military expert.

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person who is showing the symptoms – and it wouldn't be difficult for fanatics to contract it then travel to countries they want to wreak havoc in, according to a military expert.

Captain Al Shimkus a Professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, said that the strategy is entirely plausible.

He told Forbes: 'The individual exposed to the Ebola Virus would be the carrier. In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn't take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.'

And Professor Anthony Glees, Director at Buckingham University's Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, agrees that the strategy might be considered.

He said: 'In some ways it's a plausible theory – IS fighters believe in suicide and this is a potential job for a suicide mission.'

'They are sufficiently murderous and well-informed to consider it, and they know that we've been remiss in the UK,' he added.

Khorasan is a historical reference to a region that included parts of Iran and Afghanistan.

Unlike the Nusra Front, which is trying to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad, the Khorasan Group is focused chiefly on carrying out an attack against the West, officials say. 

The group is said to have been trying to recruit Europeans and Americans whose passports allow them to board a U.S.-bound airliner with less scrutiny.

In addition, according to classified U.S. intelligence assessments, the Khorasan militants have been trying to make or obtain explosives that can be slipped past airport security. 

Among their sources, officials said, has been Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, which has put bombs on airplanes, though the bombs failed to explode.

The fear is that the Khorasan militants will provide these sophisticated explosives to their Western recruits who could sneak them onto U.S.-bound flights.

One Khorasan leader, Muhsin al-Fadhli, has been eulogized on jihadi websites, but American officials are not convinced that he is dead. 

They said they believe another senior militant was killed, but have declined to name him.

A second Khorasan figure, a French militant named David Drugeon, is believed to be alive. 

Drugeon, who was born in the Brittany region and converted to Islam as a youth, spent time with Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of Pakistan before traveling to Syria, French officials say.

He was identified as a member of the Khorasan Group by two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.
