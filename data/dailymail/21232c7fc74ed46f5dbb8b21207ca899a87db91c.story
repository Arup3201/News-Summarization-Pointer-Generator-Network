Commuters without signal at London Underground stations will be updated on the score of World Cup matches this summer.

TFL and ESPNFC teamed up to deliver football updates, news, results and scores, to be displayed at more than 140 stations across the capital.

On the board: TFL and ESPNFC have teamed up to provide updates for the London Underground

On time: England fans back in the country can keep up-to-date with the scores if they are traveling

The service on the Tube will start on June 12, when hosts Brazil take on Croatia, and will continue until July 14, the day after the final. The entire Central line, Northern line, Bakerloo line and Jubilee line will be covered.

With matches in Brazil kicking off in the afternoon and evening, fans will be able to stay up to date during rush hour and on their way home from a night out.

In addition, each morning ESPNFC will deliver recap news and results from overnight, and provide all the latest news from Brazil through the day.

Former England international John Barnes said: 'This is a great way to keep fans up to date during the big games. There will be plenty of people who have to travel while matches are being played, or may have missed the results from matches the night before -- ESPN FC is ensuring they won't miss out.

'There are often debates about the use of technology in football, but I think everyone will agree this is a good one.'
