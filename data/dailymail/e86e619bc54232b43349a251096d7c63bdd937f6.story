On trial: Beate Zschaepe, 38, has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman over a 13 year period

A woman dubbed the 'Nazi moll' is standing trial accused of killing ten people after a 13 year reign of terror.

Beate Zschaepe, 38, has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in Germany. 

She gave herself to police last year and is said to have told them 'I'm the one you have been looking for,' but has remained tightlipped ever since.

Prosecutors say she helped found the National Socialist Underground (NSU) and faces life imprisonment if convicted.

She is believed to have been locked in a macabre love triangle with two of her alleged accomplices who were found dead last November.

'Everyone in Germany knows her name but no one knows who she is,' wrote the German daily Die Welt.

German police and intelligence 
agencies are braced for public fury when their collective failings are 
exposed at the country's most scandalous neo-Nazi trial which starts on 
Wednesday in Munich.

Revelations that a string of unsolved 
killings may have been a cold-blooded neo-Nazi campaign against ethnic 
Turks have shaken the nation, forcing Germans to confront painful truths
about racism and the broader treatment of immigrants in society.

The NSU had allegedly been undetected until Zschaepe blew up her rented flat in eastern Germany a year ago and gave herself up to police.

The bodies of her alleged accomplices, Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide.

The case is shaping up as an indictment against the entire German law enforcement establishment, its attitudes to dangerous neo-Nazism and the failings which led authorities to believe that a single racist maniac - dubbed 'The Doner Kebab Killer' because so many victims ran fast-food outlets - was responsible for the assassinations.

Her trial will be held in the most heavily guarded courtroom since the cases against the Baader-Meinhof terrorists of the 1970's were heard.

Charged with participation in all 10 executions, 15 robberies, setting up a terrorist organisation and numerous arsons, Zschaepe could expect, under normal German law, to be out after 15 years if convicted.

But prosecutors are seeking to implement the special clause in the national law called 'particularly grievous guilt' which allows the state to incarcerate particularly heinous criminals forever.

She is in the dock along with four supporters. It is the biggest terrorism trials ever held in Germany of extreme right-wingers since the post-WW2 republic was formed and security in Munich will be unparalleled.

Sewers have been sealed to prevent bombs being placed near the court, snipers will be on rooftops and police leave throughout Bavaria has been cancelled.

Zschaepe, idolised by Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread 'right-wing propagnada,' is branded by Germany's federal prosecutor Harald Range as being at the heart of planning and carrying out the murders.

But the trial is about so much more than her - it is about the deep national sense of shame in police failings to stop the NSU, which was composed of Zschaepe and two male sidekicks who were also her lovers.

No link was ever made between the group and the killings, despite a vast covert intelligence network.

It has led to charges that certain police and intelligence chiefs wanted to protect the NSU because they admired them, although claims of a conspiracy have been fiercely rejected.

The group was supported by a loose network of crazed neo-Nazis who dreamed of a Fourth Reich. During the killings no claim of responsibility was ever made; the group hoped that the randomness of the murders would strike fear into Germany's immigrant population who would begin leaving en-masse.

They went underground in 1998 and lived from the proceeds of bank robberies across the country.

The cell imploded on November 4 2011 when her male accomplices Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt botched a bank raid.

In a pre-arranged plan to avoid capture, Mundlos shot his accomplice before turning the gun on himself.

Zschaepe, as instructed, blew up their hideout in the east German city of Zwickau.

But the blast and subsequent fire failed to destroy a mountain of evidence, including videotapes in which the trio allegedly boasted of their crimes.

Days later, as a massive manhunt stretched across the country, she turned herself in.

Prosecutor Range, 64, said collating the evidence against her was a 'Herculean task. We collected 6,800 pieces of evidence, mostly from the wreckage of the burned-out house in Zwickau, and questioned about 1,200 witnesses. On our side, 10 public prosecutors ran the investigations, and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation.

'Their central motive was to unsettle our fellow citizens of foreign origin -- the goal being that they would leave Germany, out of fear for their own safety.'

He said it was likely that the murderers were looking to create a 'monument' for themselves with the killings.

He said that Zschaepe was involved deeply in the murders.

He went on; 'To visualize it, one could say that two people did the killing while the third person stood guard. Not directly at the scene of the crime, but by handling the cover and the logistics.

'By securing the apartment as an indispensable headquarters for the NSU, by cultivating the stories and by handling the group's financial affairs. This is why we see Beate Zschäpe as a full co-perpetrator. She collaborated in all the murders and attacks.

'There are a few clues that are already known. They include her fingerprints on newspaper articles about NSU attacks that were found in the wreckage at the site of the fire in Zwickau. Besides, the police also found many surveillance notes there. To me, this means that she knew what was going on. And there is also witness testimony that places Zschaepe very close to the scene of a crime in Nuremberg.

'She was an active participant in the discussions related to the group's armed conflict, and she was involved in illegal activities with her accomplices for almost 14 years. For that reason, I am convinced that she wasn't just an accessory or merely a companion, but was in fact acting on the same level as the others.'

Other controversies than the police bungling are swirling around the trial before the first opening statements. Munich authorities have failed to reserve a single seat for a member of the Turkish media, despite the nationality of most of the victims.

This has led to renewed charges of German racism at worst, and indifference at best, to foreigners in the country.

The trial will open just days after police discovered a neo-Nazi information service operating in the country's jails seeking to contact NSU members.

The network sent coded messages between prisons hidden in letters and the classified ads sections of magazines. Again, the news seems to have failed to reach any outrage gene among Germans, who still break out in a cold sweat about left-wing violence.
