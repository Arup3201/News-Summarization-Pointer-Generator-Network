From Tiananmen Square to the Forbidden City, smog frequently shrouds China’s famous landmarks in a grey haze.

But as well as ruining the view for tourists and posing a health risk for locals, the air pollution over Asia’s largest cities has been found to affect weather all over the world.

A team of U.S. scientists discovered that aerosols created by humans in Asian economies impact storm formation in the U.S. and beyond.

Smog greeted Formula One teams in Shanghai for the forthcoming Chinese Grand Prix this weekend.

It was uncertain that the practice was going to go ahead as factories in town and car exhaust fumes contributed to 214micrograms per cubic metre - three times the national limit.

The US Consulate warned that people with ‘heart or lung disorders, older adults and children, should avoid all physical activity’ outdoors, while healthy adults should still avoid prolonged or heavy exertion.

The particles are dangerous as they can go deep into the lungs.

The race is thought to be unaffected, particularly because factories will shut over the weekend.

Pollutants frequently reach dangerous levels in Beijing while emissions in Delhi often exceed the World Health Organisation’s recommended levels, which affect the health of people in the cities.

Scientists compared air pollution rates from 1850 to 2000 and found that man-made particles from Asia impact the Pacific storm track that can influence weather over much of the world.

A team from Texas A&M University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the University of California at San Diego and Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) used detailed pollution emission data compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and looked at two scenarios: one for a rate in 1850 before the Industrial era and one from 2000.

By comparing the results from a global climate model, the team found that aerosols impact cloud formations and mid-latitude cyclones associated with the Pacific storm track.

‘There appears to be little doubt that these particles from Asia affect storms sweeping across the Pacific and subsequently the weather patterns in North America and the rest of the world,' said Renyi Zhang, a previous researcher at Texas A&M University and employee at JPL.

‘The climate model is quite clear on this point. The aerosols formed by human activities from fast-growing Asian economies do impact storm formation and global air circulation downstream.  

‘They tend to make storms deeper and stronger and more intense, and these storms also have more precipitation in them.  We believe this is the first time that a study has provided such a global perspective.’

In recent years, researchers have learned that atmospheric aerosols affect the climate, either directly by scattering or absorbing solar radiation, or indirectly by altering cloud formations.

Increasing levels of such particles have raised concerns because of their potential impacts on regional and global atmospheric circulation.

Dr Zhang said large amounts of aerosols and their long-term journey from Asia across the Pacific can clearly be seen by satellite images.

The pacific storm track transports heat and moisture across the ocean and the scientists think it is intensified by the air flow of pollution generated in Asia.

‘Our results support previous findings that show that particles in the air over Asia tend to affect global weather patterns. It shows they can affect the Earth’s weather significantly,’ Dr Zhang said.
