Duncan Weldon (pictured) was the 'best candidate for the job' according to Newsnight editor Ian Katz, despite never having worked as a journalist before

Newsnight editor Ian Katz has defended his controversial new economics correspondent, insisting he was the ‘most suitable candidate’ for the job.

Duncan Weldon, who starts work with the flagship BBC show next month, has come under fire for his strong links to the Left and the trade unions movement, as well as a youthful flirtation with the far Right.

Others have questioned why he was preferred over more experienced candidates, given he has never worked as a journalist before.

But in a letter Tory MP Andrew Bridgen - who had raised concerns about the appointment - Mr Katz said Mr Weldon’s ‘specialist expertise’ in economics was more important than his training as a reporter.

He said: ‘Duncan was one of several candidates we considered who came from an economics rather than a conventional journalistic background…we believed a deep knowledge of economics was more important than journalistic experience for this role.’

He added: ‘It will certainly not be the first time that an individual’s communications skills and specialist expertise have made him or her the right choice despite a comparative lack of formal journalistic experience.’

Mr Weldon’s previous jobs include a stint as an adviser to Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and time as an economist at the TUC.

Last week, the Mail revealed he has penned hundreds of left-wing articles on his economics blog in which he consistently attacks Conservative economic policy.

But Mr Katz – who is the former deputy editor of The Guardian – rejected concerns his political affiliations could affect his impartiality, saying: ‘It is a fact that BBC journalists are required to put any personal views to one side when employed by the Corporation’.

He even described Mr Weldon’s blog as being ‘highly respected’, despite the concerns over its partisan content, and said it was considered to be ‘relevant experience’ when he was considered for the job.

Last night, Mr Bridgen said Mr Katz’ letter failed to address his concerns about the appointment as he did not explain how many other candidates had been interviewed for the post.

Mr Weldon is also the author of several left-wing blogs attacking the government, prompting fears the corporation is becoming biased against the Conservatives

He said: ‘There has been no transparency in this process and there are still more questions than answers.

‘Mr Weldon’s position is becoming increasingly untenable given he has admitted supporting the BNP in the past, and more recently has had strong ties to the left.

‘It is difficult to believe that someone with such strong beliefs is going to be impartial when he is conducting interviews on Newsnight.

‘How long is Ian Katz going to carry on defending him?’

In a recent blog post Mr Weldon admitted he had a ‘misguided flirtation with the ideas of the far Right’ when he was a teenager.

He was also accused of taking part in a ‘racist’ BNP leafleting campaign before he rejected right-wing politics and joined the Labour party.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are not going to comment on political affiliations of people in their teenage years whatever they may have been.’
