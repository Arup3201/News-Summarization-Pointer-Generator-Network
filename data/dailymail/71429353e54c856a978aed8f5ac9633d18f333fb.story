Space-age slap: The new Fusion Foundation by Yves Saint Laurent, which already has a waiting list of 12,000 women who are keen to get their hands on it

Thousands of women are clamouring to sign up for a designer foundation that claims to use space-age technology to keep it working for 24 hours.

Nearly 12,000 women are already on the waiting list for Yves Saint Laurent’s Fusion Foundation – three weeks before it is released nationwide.

The hi-tech make-up contains a material called lipophilic acid, which is used to capture space dust. This interstellar ingredient makes the product the most technologically advanced make-up in the world, say YSL.

The microscopic substance absorbs grease from the face, leaving an even, matte surface for up to 24 hours. 

This is because the lipophilic acid has a honeycomb-shaped texture, allowing it to absorb up to four times its own weight in moisture, it is claimed.

The formula also contains a ‘hydrophilic agent’ – a clay-like mix of minerals which acts like ‘an invisible sponge’, soaking up moisture from the face, as well as a ‘beautyleaf extract’ designed to mimic the fatty acids found on the surface of the skin. 

Caroline Negre, YSL's scientific communications director, said: 'Fusion Foundation is a ground-breaking response to modern demands for trustworthy, perfect coverage that lasts for up to 24 hours without compromising on texture.

'This combination of active agents is a first for Yves Saint Laurent Beauté. Fusion Foundation contains a new blend of hydrophilic and lipophilic agents and tamanu oil. 

'This hybrid technology means the volatile oils in the foundation evaporate quickly after application - leaving just the pigments and actives behind on the skin.'

Created by Yves Saint Laurent Beauté skincare laboratory in Paris, the formula contains 'pure, milled pigments each with a micro-coating that merges perfectly with the surface of the skin, thus ensuring it remains uniform, weightless and long-wearing,' YSL said.

Creative director of make-up at YSL, Lloyd Simmonds, said: 'Other formulas tend to be quite thick in texture, a little heavy and form a barrier on the skin. This has a lightness of texture which is completely new.

'As a make-up artist, my criteria for foundation are that I don't want to see it on the skin, it has to be invisible and weightless.

'So the aim was to create a weightless formula with an invisible, long-lasting coverage and that's what we have. It has a natural-looking, mattifying effect on the skin - without appearing dry or caked on. And it lasts the entire day.' 

YSL claimed that unlike other foundations, this product is not too heavy and will not form an impenetrable barrier over the skin. 

The dispenser for the foundation was inspired by the way a calligrapher would dip his quill in a pot of ink, which YSL said was designed to eliminate the fashion faux-pas of applying too much make-up. 

It said the dispenser's plume is fanned at the base and tapered at the tip, which it says allows the optimum amount of foundation onto the skin without any surplus.

The foundation will be available exclusively from Debenhams from August 10th and then nationwide from August 20th.
