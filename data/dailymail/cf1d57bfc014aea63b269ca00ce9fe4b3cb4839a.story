Neymar could return to action for Barcelona on August 18 as the serious back injury that curtailed his World Cup continues to heal.

The Brazil star fractured a bone following a challenge by Colombia defender Juan Zuniga in their quarter-final match and was ruled out for the rest of the tournament.

But he is targeting the Gamper Trophy fixture with Mexican side Leon on August 18 for his comeback, which would come a week before the start of their La Liga campaign against Elche.

Speaking at a promotional event in Japan, Neymar said: 'I am recovering bit by bit from the injury and I will arrive in Barcelona at 100 per cent.

'I want to have a good season and I would like to help my team-mates get good results.'

The 22-year-old forward is expected to report back to Barcelona on August 5.

The Catalan club ended last season without major silverware for the first time in six years and coach Gerardo Martino was sacked and replaced by former player Luis Enrique.Â
