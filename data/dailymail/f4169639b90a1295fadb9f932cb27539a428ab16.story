Bryan Henderson is among the top 1,000 most active Wikipedia editors for his dedication to correcting the misuse of the phrase 'comprised of'

As grammatical errors go, it is perhaps so obscure that most people would read on without giving it a second thought.

But the misuse of the term 'comprised of' bothers one obsessive Wikipedia editor so much, he has spent nearly a decade correcting the mistake 47,000 times.

Software engineer Bryan Henderson, known online as Giraffedata, spends an hour every Sunday evening fixing between 70 and 80 cases of the error that have appeared on Wikipedia over the previous week.

Using software the 51-year-old designed himself, he sends a request to Wikipedia's server for articles containing the phrase, Medium.com reported.

Pages containing it are then extracted and compared to a database of articles he has edited in the past six months.

Any matches between the two sets of results are then removed from his list, in order to avoid bothering editors who have become overprotective of their pages.

Links for the remaining articles are then presented for him to click through, edit and upload - a process which takes approximately ten seconds for every correction.

Despite making the fixes reasonably quickly, Mr Henderson says that is down to having practiced the art since 2007.

He said: 'An edit typically takes about ten seconds, but that’s because I’ve gotten really, really good at it.

'I’m actually putting a lot of thought into those ten seconds. Some of them take a lot longer; some of them take minutes.' 

The essay written by Mr Henderson and published on Wikipedia which explains his obsessive amount of intervention

Mr Henderson claims the phrase 'comprised of' is 'completely unnecessary'.

He said: 'There are many other ways to say what the writer means by "comprised of". It adds nothing to the language.'

The Wikipedia user suggests 'composed of' or 'consists of' as possible alternatives to the forbidden phrase. 

Mr Henderson's argument is that 'to comprise' means to include, as in: 'Britain comprises all of England, Wales and Scotland.'

By this definition, the phrase 'Britain is comprised of...' does not make sense. 

Remarkably, his case for why it is ungrammatical is laid out in a 6,000-word essay in which he claims it stems from confusion between the phrases 'composed of' and 'comprised'.

Within the essay, he also responds to critics who have regularly labelled him a pedant.

He writes: 'I won't offer a rebuttal of that, because an individual editor's allocation of his time shouldn't be anyone else's concern.'

His grammar campaign has not been welcomed by everyone, with some Wikipedia page creators reverting his edits. One user erased his changes on 30 pages, in the same order which he made them.

Despite making the fix 47,000 times, Mr Henderson is still only scrapes into Wikipedia's top 1,000 contributors - in 978th place. The top editor - going by the name Koavf - has made almost 1.5million edits.
