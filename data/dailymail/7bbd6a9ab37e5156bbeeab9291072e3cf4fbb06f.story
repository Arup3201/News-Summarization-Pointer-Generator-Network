Stuart Hazell today pleaded guilty to murdering Tia Sharp after months of lying about her final movements.

During the week-long hunt for the then missing schoolgirl, Hazell, 37, a convicted drug dealer, denied abducting her, saying she was 'like my own daughter'.

At the time Hazell was the partner of Tia's grandmother Christine Bicknell.

He said at the time: 'My previous has got nothing to do with it. Everyone's got a shady past. Did I do anything to Tia? No I bloody didn't. I'd never think of that.'

Lies: Stuart Hazell pretended to be devoted to Tia Sharp after murdering her and hiding her body

He described 12-year-old Tia as 'a happy-go-lucky golden angel' and said there had been no problems at her 'loving home' before she vanished.

Hazell said he and Tia had been alone at the home he shared with Ms Bicknell in South London on the Thursday night and Friday morning when she disappeared.

Victim: Hazell murdered Tia at his home in South London last August

On the Friday, he said, she left the house at 12.10pm, having previously told him she wanted to buy some new shoes.

She did not take her mobile phone, which was charging, or a travel card and had no bag when she left.

Hazell broke down as he spoke, supported by Tia's uncle David Sharp.

Both wore white 'Find Tia' T-shirts and a large picture of the schoolgirl was pinned to the wall behind them.

Hazell said he felt people were 'pointing the finger' at him because he had been the last person to see her.

He added: 'I know deep down in my heart that Tia walked out of my house.

'I know she was seen walking down the pathway, she made her way down that track. What happened after that. I don't know.'

Evidence: CCTV footage showed Hazell shopping with the 12-year-old hours before her death

Pretence: Hazell pictured in court today, having finally admitted responsibility for Tia's death

He even cooked dinner for her the evening after she disappeared, saying he would save it for when she returned in an effort to convince Ms Bicknell that he was trying to find her rather than being responsible for her disappearance.

After Hazell was arrested, he eventually admitted he had stashed Tia's body in the attic of the house where he was living in New Addington, South London, but insisted she had broken her neck after falling down the stairs.

He continued to protest his innocence in a series of discussions with prison officers, but at one point started inquiring into the possibility of pleading guilty to manslaughter.

It was not until today that the truth was finally revealed - that he had sexually assaulted the schoolgirl while her grandmother was away, then apparently suffocated her and hid her body to avoid being found out.Â
