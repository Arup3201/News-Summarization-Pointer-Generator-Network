Police have been forced to release images of a mother stealing an expensive pram from a GP surgery after doctors refused to name her for data protection reasons.

The thief was caught on CCTV walking into the entrance of her local practice before swapping her child’s pram for a more expensive one in the entrance hall.

She then wandered off with the posh pushchair, leaving mother-of-two Hayley Skidmore stunned when she came out to find hers gone and an old, cheap one in its place.

Out with the old: This mother is being sought by police after she was filmed walking into a GP's surgery with this old pram only to swap it for a more expensive version

In with the new: The woman left with the pricey pram, leaving her old one in its place, but medical staff have refused to name her because of Data Protection laws

Surgery staff told Hayley to call police and when officers arrived to view the security film workers immediately recognised the suspect.

But they refused give her name, saying it would break data protection and patient confidentiality laws.

Avon and Somerset Police have now been forced to release CCTV images to the public in the hope that they can trace and question the woman.

However, a spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said that the act should not be used to block an investigation.

A spokesman said: 'While I cannot comment on this specific case, where police have reasonable grounds to believe a crime has taken place the act should not be a barrier to that investigation.'

Hayley, 26, of Cadbury Heath, Bristol, is furious the surgery is protecting the suspected thief.

She said: 'I’m still in shock about it.

'The manager told me she had been told not to reveal the name because of the Data Protection Act. I don’t understand it.

'Obviously the woman was there for an appointment, but giving her name to police would have nothing to do with her private medical information - it’s about a suspected crime.

'She should be prosecuted - she shouldn’t be allowed to get away with something like that.'

Hayley was visiting the surgery for a general check-up for her one-year-old son Lewis on February 5 when the theft happened.

Hayley Skidmore, mother-of-two, was left shocked when she came out of her appointment with one-year-old son Lewis to discover her pram was gone

She had left the £300 limited edition black Maclaren, bought last May, for around an hour just inside the entrance in an area designated for buggies and strollers.

But it was taken along with Lewis’s foot muff, his three-year-old sister Lola-Mae’s wellies, hat, and gloves, and paintings Lewis had done at pre-school.

Ms Skidmore had her £300 Maclaren pram returned after the surgery contacted the thief, but police still don't know her identity

When a police officer arrived he was provided with a clear image of the prime suspect.

But practice manager Helen Tillman said she could not reveal her name because she had been instructed not to, having taken legal advice from the Medical Defence Union (MDU).

She was also advised not to comment to the media and the MDU has refused to further explain the decision.

At the time of publishing the surgery were unavailable for further comment.

Mrs Tillman did offer to contact the suspect and two days later the pram was returned.

But a month after the incident at the Cadbury Heath Health Centre in Bristol police are still struggling to identify the suspected thief.

NHS Property Services Ltd, which owns the health centre, also declined to comment.

Hayley added: 'Everything was still in there when I got it back - even the juice that was in a beaker and the little bit of money in the back of the pram.

Avon and Somerset police spokesman Martin Dunscombe said: 'As a result of positive action taken by the health centre the pram has been returned.

'We are waiting to speak to the victim about this, but at the moment our investigation is continuing.'

He said a pushchair left behind by the suspect had been seized for forensic examination.

He added: 'The staff at the health centre are doing as much as they can to support the investigation within the constraints of their own legal advice.'
