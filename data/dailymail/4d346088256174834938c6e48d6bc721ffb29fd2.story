A 23-year-old Lakeside, Florida man has been arrested for the murder on May 28 of drag queen and Whitney Houston impersonator Anthony Lee, whose stage name was South Beach Wanda.

Deandre Tolliver was arrested for first-degree murder and armed robbery in Lakeside on Saturday, the same day Anthony Lee was put to rest.

Investigators say they were able to link the car used in the murder to Tolliver, but are still looking for two accomplices.

Slain: Anthony Lee, 49, also known as drag queen South Beach Wanda (left), was shot dead in Tampa, Florida. Deandre Tolliver (right), 23, has been arrested for first-degree murder and armed robbery

According to Tampa police Tolliver, 23, was one of three suspects who arrived in a dark colored Dodge Magnum at 3911 East Genessee St where Lee was staying to care for a sick friend.

Consummate performer: 'I'm a comedian. Don't sit in the front row if you don't want to be picked on. I'm different. There's nobody on the Beach like me,' Anthony Lee told the Miami New Times in '98

The Miami New Times said Lee was 
cooking dinner at his friend's house the night of May 28 when a suspect 
knocked at the door.

Lee opened the door and was shot five times at 
point blank range. Police believe it may have been a case of mistaken 
identity.

According to Bay 
News 9, police think the house was targeted, but it is unclear if the 
bullet was meant for someone else, or if the case was a botched home 
invasion.

A neighbor heard the commotion and ran to help, but Lee's injuries were too grave and he died at the scene.

'I [saw] him fighting for his breath. I was trying to help him breathe before the police came,' Jeremy Judkins told Bay News 9.

Tolliver is already on probation 
after serving six months in prison for assault with a deadly weapon.

Police aren't saying exactly what Tolliver's role in the shooting was, but he is 
facing charges of murder in the first degree and armed robbery.

At Hamburger Mary's, a Ybor City 
institution where Wanda was a regular performer, owner Kurt King, 
employees and friends of Lee gathered to hold a fundraiser on Thursday 
to help pay for his funeral.

Crime scene: Lee went visit an ailing friend at 3911 East Genesee in Tampa when he was gunned down by a stranger who came knocking on the door

Towering personality: At six-foot-six without heels, when Anthony Lee became his alter-ego Wanda, people couldn't help but take notice

'I was just shocked,' King, who had known Lee for 22 years, told the Tampa Bay Times.

'I heard about it 20 minutes after it happened. I
didn't believe it until a friend called me and said it was true.'

As Wanda, Lee would often take the stage at Hamburger Mary's resplendent in his favorite blond wig and sequinned gown to lip sync to Whitney Houston.

King said investigators told him that Lee was cooking dinner at his female friend's house when the suspects arrived.

Larger than life: Sadly, South Beach Wanda, or Sobe Wanda, has something else in common with her idol Whitney Houston - they both died too young in tragic circumstances

'It was just like Wanda to be cooking for somebody,' said James Bailey,
a friend and bartender at Hamburger Mary's. 'She was always cooking for
us.'

The funeral was held on Saturday at the Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church in Tampa.

'Today we laid him to rest and GOD answered my prayers and TPD did their job,' Lee's sister, Barbara Lee-Thomas, wrote in a Facebook post. 'My GOD will answer prayers.'

Beloved: Wanda was famous for her balloon-filled bust-line and comical drag performances

Wanda performed her swansong at Hamburger Mary's the Thursday before last.

King said Wanda's career was long and successful, with gigs up and down the country. She first worked for King in 1991, and the two formed a close friendship over the years.

Wanda was known for her Whitney Houston obsession, snarky one-liners and outrageous antics including donning a dress made of tampons and jumping into a pool.

Fabulous: Wanda was known for her high-necked, long-sleeved, sequin-encrusted gowns

'She was very funny, hanging from the
rafters and swinging, having fun. She impersonated Whitney Houston, 
wore balloons instead of a bra. When she was in the show, it was a show 
of her own,' said King.

At 
Thursday's fundraiser, a dozen fellow drag queens performed. Each began 
their performance with their fondest memory of Wanda, which was often of
a memorable insult Wanda had thrown their way.

'We just want justice to be done,' said Power Infiniti, a fellow drag queen whose first meeting with Lee involved being laughed at.

'He thought I looked a hot mess,' said Infiniti.

Head and shoulders above: Friends and colleagues of Wanda are mourning her loss as Deandre Tolliver, 23, faces murder charges for the shooting death of Anthony Lee

'We’d been friends for, like I 
said, 17 years and we actually got to know each other when I was first 
starting out as a club kid in South Beach,' he recalled to Bay News 9.

The pair were together just over a week ago in Ybor City.

'The next thing I hear is that he is dead was a shock to say the least,' he said. He and Lee had exchanged text messages just hours before.

Kind words: One of Lee's sisters remembered her brother as a warm person who genuinely loved people

'He was very strong,' Power Infiniti 
said. 'He told it like it was and he was very forthright. If he loved 
you, he loved you fiercely and he was an amazing friend.'

'She was in my wedding, she caught the bouquet. And then took her wig off, and went for the garter,' wrote South Beach nightlife impresario Eric Milon's wife, Stacy of Wanda, in the comments section of the Miami Herald.

Police
records show Tolliver has a violent history with a string of offenses 
to his name, beginning in 2004 when he was arrested on drug charges by 
Polk County deputies.

Other
arrests include aggravated assault with a firearm, aggravated assault, 
battery, burglary, marijuana possession, grand theft, resisting arrest 
and failure to appear in court.

He was in state prison from July 2011
until January 2012 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, was on 
probation at the time of his latest arrest.

Anthony Jerome Lee is survived by three sisters and four brothers and numerous nieces and nephews.

According to his friend King, the siblings' mother died just a few weeks ago.
