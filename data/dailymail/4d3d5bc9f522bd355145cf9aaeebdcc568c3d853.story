A man was brutally beaten by three men in the Angel Stadium parking lot after an important play-off match.

The 43-year-old man and his relative were walking to a car after the Los Angeles Angels' game against the Kansas City Royals on Friday night when they were attacked in an unprovoked assault.

Witnesses alerted Anaheim police officers of the incident and they found the victim unconscious.

He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was said to be in a critical condition. The male relative was not injured.

Kansas City Royals won the three-game series against Los Angeles Angels 8-3 to mark a return to the American League Championship series - but after Friday's match a fan was brutally beaten in the parking lot

Anaheim police Lieutenant Bob Dunn said: 'There is no evidence to suggest there was an argument or any type of physical altercation prior to the incident in the parking lot.' 

He added that there was no indication to suggest the attack was anything to do with team rivalries. 

Angels' spokesman Tim Mead said no extra security at the stadium was planned.

'Our response was immediate,' Mr Mead said. 'We are very confident with our security out there...it's not a rivalry (issue) at all.'

Lt Dunn said the Anaheim Police Department increased the presence of police officers during the post-season.

'At this particular event, there was an increased staffing – above and beyond what we would deploy at a regular-season game', he said. 

In the three game series, the Kansas City Royals beat the Angels' 8-3 to mark a return to the American League Championship Series.

This is not the first time an attack has taken place at Angel Stadium. 

In June 2009, an off-duty Anaheim police officer shot 23-year-old Carlos Velasquez in the Angel Stadium parking lot during a fight. 

Mr Velasquez, who was left partially paralysed, died two years later. 

His brother, Jose Velasquez, who was also involved in the fight, was also shot. The officer was cleared of any wrongdoing.

The Angel Stadium, in Anaheim, California, is located 30 miles south of the Dodger Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, where a San Francisco Giants fan was beaten in 2011 after a game between the rival teams. 

Bryan Stow, a paramedic from Northern California, spent months in a medically induced coma after being punched in the head, kicked and slammed to the ground outside Dodger Stadium.

He suffered brain damage from the beating and was left permanently disabled. 

The violence led to a scrutiny of stadium security and fan behavior.
