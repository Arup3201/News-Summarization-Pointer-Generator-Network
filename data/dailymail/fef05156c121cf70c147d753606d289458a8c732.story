The BBC is too concerned with the appearance of its female presenters, according to one of its former newsreaders.

Alice Arnold – the partner of one of the corporation’s star presenters, Clare Balding – said the BBC should stand up against the culture of women being prized for their looks.

Ms Arnold, who left her position as BBC Radio 4 newsreader two weeks ago, said sexism is still a problem at the corporation.

She told the London Evening Standard: 'You look at men of a certain age or appearance who are on TV and think: "If you were a woman, you wouldn't be there."

'It's a constant struggle in a culture that prizes looks and youth so highly, but the BBC needs to stand up and say "No".

'Clare is a very good example of breaking that mould.'

On Saturday, Balding hosted Britain's Brightest Brain in the prime time slot.

Her appointment is a significant break in personnel from the likes of Tess Daley, who presents Strictly Come Dancing with Sir Bruce Forsyth.

The new series comes after Balding's presenting during London 2012 was widely celebrated for her enthusiastic but clear and informative style.

Ms Arnold, 50, said her partner has got where she is through 'talent'.

She told the newspaper: 'If you're in a position where people will look at you and listen to you then you have to grasp that opportunity. We both feel very strongly about it.'

Ms Arnold's comments may reignite the row over ageism and sexism at the BBC.

Former Countryfile presenter Miriam 
O'Reilly won an ageism case against the BBC last year and broadcasting 
veterans such as Anna Ford, 
Selina Scott and Joan Bakewell have been among many female voices who 
have attacked the treatment of women on TV.

Lone voice: Alice Arnold, a former Today programme newsreader, is bothered by the lack of female voices on air, and said: 'Sarah Montague (pictured left, with Jim Naughtie) is great, but she's the only one out of five'

The controversy over ageism was 
sparked in 2009 when Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips, then 
66, was dropped in favour of Alesha Dixon, 30.

In a further blow to the BBC, Ms 
Arnold also criticised the Today programme, Radio 4's flagship news and 
current affairs show, for a lack of female voices.

She said the show 'badly' lets Radio 4 down by having just Sarah Montague out of five presenters.

The former actor and lawyer said it 
is 'such a missed opportunity' but praised the station as a whole for 
using 'serious' women presenters.

In November the programme also  invited an average of five male experts for every woman.

In the same month it came under fire for inviting only male experts for a discussion of breast cancer.

At one point, presenter John Humphrys even asked a male contributor to imagine he was a woman.

Ms Arnold added that the BBC she left
felt 'unsettled' by the Jimmy Savile and Newsnight controversies and 
said cuts are also taking its toll on the workforce.

She said there is 'absolutely no slack' left in the corporation.

Miss Balding and Miss Arnold have been 
together for ten years and celebrated the sixth anniversary of their 
civil partnership last year.
