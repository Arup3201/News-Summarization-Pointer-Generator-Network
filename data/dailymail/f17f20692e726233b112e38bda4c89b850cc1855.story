Tie, the dog that chased a commuter train heading into Manhattan from the Bronx on Tuesday, will be put up for adoption on Friday unless his owner claims him before then.

Late Tuesday morning, an engineer on a southbound Metro-North train spotted the Collie-Shepherd mix near a train yard in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx, DNAinfo reported. Tie, who is thought to be about three, then ran with the train all the way down to the 125th St. station in the Harlem section of Manhattan, a distance about a mile and a half away.

Tie — named after railroad ties in between train tracks —was running on a track parallel to the one the train was on, according to the New York Post. A couple of times, the dog fell between the ties, but managed to get up and continue racing.

'He was just running like she didn’t have a care in the world,' the train's engineer, Joseph Delia, said.

'The dog was in front of me, running in front,' said Delia, an dog lover himself, who alerted the Metro-North command center and police. 'Oh, my God, I was going real slow.' He added he was concerned the dog would get hurt.

'She’s not a very big dog.' Delia said. 'I was worried she wouldn’t make it and get electrocuted.'

If Tie's owner does not come forward by Friday, the dog will be put up for adoption

When the train arrived at the 125th St. station, two Metropolitan Transit Authority officers and a Metro-north employee were waiting to scoop him up. When they started going down to reach Tie, he came to them.

'If the owner doesn’t claim the dog hopefully I’ll be on the list to adopt her,' said MTA officer Luis Alvarez, who rescued the dog with his partner Errold Borges. 'I have three girls, they are all texting me to get the dog.'

The dog was then placed in the care on Animal Care & Control of NYC, a local shelter, who checked to see if Tie had a mocrochip implanted in him, but did not.

However, given Tie's behavior and physical appearance, shelter officials think he has an owner who takes very good care of her.

'She looks very well cared for and very well fed,' Risa Weinstock of Animal Care & Control said. 'She did a lot of tricks and knows a lot of commands, that’s not something you learn on the street.'
