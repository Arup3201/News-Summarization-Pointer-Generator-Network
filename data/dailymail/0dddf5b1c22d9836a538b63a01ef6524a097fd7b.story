A  woman who fell pregnant just four months after beating cancer has given birth - despite doctors believing she was infertile.

Clare Wolfswinkel, from Liverpool, found a lump on her groin at 27-weeks pregnant with her first child - she was quickly diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

The 37-year-old was terrified the gruelling rounds of chemotherapy would not only harm her unborn baby but prevent her from becoming a mother again in the future.

Happy families: Clare Wolfswinkel, with her husband and her daughter Sienna in June 2014, was diagnosed with cancer when pregnant with her first child. She has since gone on to beat it and welcome her second baby

Thankfully, her baby, Noah, survived and she fell pregnant with her daughter, Sienna, just four months after being given the all clear.

Clare said: 'I was devastated when doctors said it was likely that my cancer treatment would leave me infertile.

'Me and my husband Geerling did want more children in the future but we were thrilled to have one healthy baby.

'We focused on our future together and I was determined to beat cancer for my family.'

Beating the odds: Clare with Noah and Sienna in August 2014, gave  birth just four months after beating cancer - despite doctors believing she was infertile.

All together: The couple were overjoyed when scans revealed Clare's cancer had been cured but they never imagined they were soon to become a family of four

Diagnosis: Clare, pictured with Sienna, found a lump on her groin at 27-weeks pregnant with her first child - she was quickly diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma

Acceptance: Clare, pictured with Sienna, said: 'Losing your hair and seeing yourself bald makes the whole process seem more real. You never expect to be pregnant and having to fight cancer'

The couple were overjoyed when scans revealed Clare's cancer had been cured but they never imagined they were soon to become a family of four.

Clare added: 'I couldn't believe it when I fell pregnant so quickly, it was amazing.

'I was equally petrified as I feared my cancer would return in my second pregnancy.'

Clare was diagnosed in January 2013 after she was rubbing her bump and first noticed a walnut-like lump on her groin.

She had also been feeling tired but thought it was just pregnancy related.

Doctors quickly diagnosed Clare with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and on the same day underwent an MRI scan, bone marrow was taken and an operation to remove the tumour.

Charitable: After being diagnosed with cancer while pregnant Clare tried to find other women in the same situation and discovered Mummy's Star charity, which is dedicated to helping pregnant women who are affected by cancer

She said: 'I was shocked and scared when I was diagnosed with cancer. I never thought in a million years it would be anything that serious.

'From that moment on I was in a daze, it didn't feel real.' 

She said: 'I can't praise the healthcare enough, the hospital was amazing and it was their quick actions that saved my life.

'I lost my long brown hair after just two sessions of chemo, that was awful but I was so lucky the cancer was treated so fast.

Miracle baby: Clare said: 'Sienna is three-months-old now and she has completed our family, her brother, Noah, is just 18-months-old, so I know they'll have a close bond when they're older'

'Losing your hair and seeing yourself bald makes the whole process seem more real. You never expect to be pregnant and having to fight cancer.

'On top of this I also lost my job but my main focus was my son and beating cancer.' 

She went into remission in June 2013 and was able to start enjoying her maternity leave with Noah; Clare could only dream of one day becoming a mother-of-two.

Clare added: 'Sienna is three-months-old now and she has completed our family, her brother, Noah, is just 18-months-old, so I know they'll have a close bond when they're older.

'My children are my life, they make me smile everyday and my husband was amazing all the way through my treatment, as was my family and friends.

'I had no problems with my second pregnancy and I just have cancer check-ups every six months.'

After being diagnosed with cancer while pregnant Clare tried to find other women in the same situation.

This is when she discovered Mummy's Star - an amazing charity dedicated to helping pregnant women who are affected by cancer.

Clare said: 'Mummy's star has been amazing for me and through them I have connected with other woman who have been in my situation, we are like a little family. I think Pete has done fantastic in starting this amazing charity.'

Pete Wallroth, Founder of Mummy's Star, said: 'When Clare first contacted us she explained that when she received her diagnosis when pregnant she had found absolutely no support at all for the situation she found herself in or someone else with shared experiences.

'Being pregnant and being diagnosed with any form of cancer, from my wife's experience, is so isolating as the common phrase we hear from women is that they feel like they are the only one.

'Clare has found our support and forums a massive help and we are just glad that we are now there for women and families like hers, where beforehand there were few if any options for such women to turn to.'

Joining forces: The 36-year-old was terrified the gruelling rounds of chemotherapy would not only harm her unborn baby but prevent her from becoming a mother again in the future but after her ordeal, she wanted to find other women in her position
