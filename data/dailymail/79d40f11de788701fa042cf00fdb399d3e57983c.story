Four peregrine falcons – including three chicks – have been poisoned in their nest, in the latest case in a series of attacks to shock RSPB officers.

The birds had made their home on a steep crag at Dyffryn Nantlle, in Gwynedd, North Wales. It is thought they were killed with contaminated bait.

Police spokesman PC Dewi Evans said that foul play was ‘highly probable’.

And the RSPB said it would be unheard of for four birds to die naturally in such circumstances.

Simon Hugheston-Roberts, from RSPB Cymru, said: ‘We have had a number of incidents of peregrine falcons being illegally persecuted in North Wales.

‘The circumstances are highly suspicious, and we are concerned that perhaps poisoned bait has been brought back to the nest by one of the parents resulting in the tragic death of all four birds. 

‘We would urge anyone with information about this or similar incidents to contact police.’

If prosecuted, offenders face six months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to £5,000.

In April, the bodies of 12 red kites and four buzzards were recovered within a two-square-mile area on the Black Isle, North of Inverness, in what ornithologists suspect is the largest ever mass poisoning of birds.

The RSPB offered a £10,000 reward for help in catching the culprits.
