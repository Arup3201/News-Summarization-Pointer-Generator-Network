If the photographer had blinked, he'd have missed it.

As vast waves pounded the west country yesterday, one photographer took this astonishing shot.

For just a split second, the spray from the 30ft wave created the perfect shape of a man's profile, complete with brow, nose, mouth, chin and even beard.

The wave then broke over the Cobb, or harbour wall, at Lyme Regis, in Dorset, which has taken a battering in the recent storms.

Britain was lashed by another violent storm yesterday, and forecasters warned of similarly strong winds in the south west today.

Communities in Cornwall, Devon and in Ireland are under water after rivers burst their banks and sea defences were breached by high tides rushed in on gale-force gusts.

At least 5,000 properties are still without power in the south west, and 39,000 homes had to have power restored after winds peaked at 80mph overnight and Western Power Distribution said the violent conditions had caused 'airborne debris' to fly into overhead lines and made repairs difficult.

David Cameron confirmed this morning he will chair a meeting of the Cobra committee today to discuss the storm damage and the response.
