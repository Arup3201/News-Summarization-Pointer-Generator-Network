The rise and rise of Tyler Blackett continues at pace. The 20-year-old has been at Manchester United since he was seven, but before this season was barely known outside the walls of Carrington.

Six games into his season, though, and he could soon find himself on £50,000 a week, having started the campaign on £2,000 - a pay increase of 2,400 per cent.

A £50,000 sum may seem the going rate for a centre back starting regularly for United, but has Blackett really justified such a staggering pay rise?

Sunderland (a) 1-1 - 5

Burnley (a) 0-0 - 5.5

QPR (h) won 4-0 - 6.5

Leicester (a) lost 5-3 - 4.5

Everton (h) won 2-1 - 7 (came on at 70 mins)

Louis van Gaal has spoken glowingly about Blackett and has been impressed by his dedication to improving himself - the defender, as reported previously by Sportsmail, regularly puts in extra training sessions on days off.

Yet the fact remains that in the five games Blackett has started this season he has not scored a rating higher than 6.5 from Sportsmail's reporters.

His highest rating has been a 7 - but that came in a 20-minute cameo in the 2-1 win over Everton.

It must also be remembered that Paul Pogba - now a full French international and one of the best young players in Europe - left Old Trafford when the club balked at his pay demands.

Pogba wanted a reported £20,000 a week and when he didn't get it joined Juventus, where he has gone on to win two Serie A titles but is still only on £23,000.

Adnan Januzaj was recently rewarded with a new contract at United but he is paid a reported £30,000 a week

Adnan Januzaj, who so impressed last season and was linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain, is only on a reported £30,000 a week.

There will be those that say that no young player - regardless of how good they are - deserves to be lavished with such vast sums.

Others will say that, with Blackett's contract due to expire next year, United had to splash out to keep him at the club.

Should Blackett go on to become a regular for United for the next decade then £50,000 a week will seem a snip and a masterstroke by the club's hierarchy. 

But, at present, it seems to be another example of United's apparent willingness to throw money around without concern.

By all accounts, Blackett seems to a sensible young man who won't let the money distract him but with his potential sky-high wages now known the pressure will continue to increase on his inexperienced shoulders. Any slip-up and that figure will be bandied about.

Blackett is not to blame for this, of course - United's paymasters ultimately sign off any deal and questions must be asked of them.

But the centre back will have to attempt to go about his business and prove he is worth the cash, but should such a young man still finding his way in the Premier League be under such intense pressure so soon?

Blackett operates as a left-sided centre back and has looked assured despite being just 20 years of age
