A driver forced to abandon his car in a snow-filled ditch after sliding off the road was horrified when he returned to find it destroyed by an irate farmer who used a forklift to remove it from his land.

Dan Neal left a note on the windscreen of his Citroen C2 after he skidded off the road and into a fence as he drove home in the snow. But that didn't stop Edward Gilbert from using the twin blades of his forklift to wrench the £3,000 car from the ditch, piercing the bodywork and smashing the windows.

And when shocked Mr Neal - whose car has now gone to the scrapyard - challenged Edward Gilbert, the farmer demanded he hand over £250 for damaging his fence.

'Confiscated': A hole in the roof of the Citroen where farmer Edward Gilbert pierced the bodywork with the blade of his forklift

Shock: Mr Gilbert used a forklift truck to remove the car from his land when Dan Neal was forced to abandon it after sliding from the road in ice and snow

Mr Neal's eight year old car was left with smashed windows, a hole in the roof, a missing wing mirror and scratches all over the doors after Mr Gilbert used the forklift to wrench the vehicle from the ditch.

But the 24-year-old said the farmer remained defiant when confronted about his actions.

'He said "I've confiscated your car because I'm sick of people driving into my fence",' said Mr Neal.

'He was very matter-of-fact about it. He even said I owed him £250 - I couldn't believe what he was saying.'

The police have told Mr Neal he cannot prove criminal intent and the incident must be dealt with by insurers.

His eight year-old car was towed away and he is now waiting to hear what compensation he will get - and from who.

Until then Mr Neal is stuck at home in the isolated village of Fleckney, near Leicester, with no means of getting to his job in the customer service department at British Gas.

Mr Neal had been
driving home from work in heavy snow around 6pm last Friday evening 
when he skidded off a bend and into the ditch next to Mr Gilbert's Wistow Grange farm in Leicestershire.

The
car suffered a few minor scratches but the RAC was unable to attend and
Dan was advised to leave the vehicle with a note on the dashboard.

He said: 'I ended up next
to a wooden fence post - there was hardly any damage apart from a 
couple of scratches and the post was left at a slight angle.

'I
called the RAC from the scene and they said they couldn't get to me 
immediately and to leave a note on the dashboard saying the car would be
collected as soon as possible.

'I
managed to get a lift home from my girlfriend and then I met the RAC 
the next morning and went back with them around 9.30am and the car was 
gone.

'I called the 
police to see if anyone had reported it and they'd heard nothing so I 
went on a bit of a detective hunt myself,' Mr Neal said.

Dan
and the RAC patrolman drove around the snow-covered area looking for 
any sign of the car before they spotted a couple of men in a nearby 
field.

He said: 'We got out to speak to them and as we did the farmer appeared and told us what he'd done.

'He said he'd confiscated the car and taken it away with a forklift truck and put it in his farmyard.'

And when the farmer took Dan to the barn he was horrified to discover his once pristine Citroen was now a mangled wreck.

Defiant: Mr Neal skidded into a fence at Wistow Grange farm, owned by Edward Gilbert, as he was driving home from work in the snow

He said: 'We went to his farm and it 
was in one of his barns and he took it out with his forklift, although 
this time he picked it up underneath.

'The car had been destroyed - both side windows were smashed and the roof had been put through.

'If it had been a £50,000 Bentley I might have left it in the ditch'

'The windscreen was cracked, there were dents in the doors and one of the wing mirrors was missing. It was in a real state.'

The undriveable car was lifted onto the back of the RAC's recovery vehicle and taken away as scrap.

Mr Neal said: 'The police have told me they don't want to get involved as they can't prove that the farmer acted maliciously.

'My
insurers have said they'll get in touch with the farmer to try to sort 
it out and I'm left without a car living in the middle of nowhere and I 
can't get to work.'

But defiant Mr Gilbert, 38, has defended his actions and said he was 'within his rights' to remove the car.

'It had damaged the fence and there were sheep in the field and a danger they could escape,' he said.

'It was dark and snowing and I couldn't see any sign in the car and the forklift was the only way I had of lifting it off the fence.'

He added: 'We get fed up with people going through the hedges and abandoning their cars.

'If it had been a £50,000 Bentley I might have left it in the ditch.

'But as it is I'm waiting to send him my personal invoice for the damage he's caused to my fence.'
