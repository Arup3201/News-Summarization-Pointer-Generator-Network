Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City are monitoring Malaga's latest starlet Jose Luis Zalazar, known as Kuki.

The 16-year-old is the son of former Uruguay international Jose Luis Zalazar but plays for Spain at U17 level where he is regarded as the star turn. Liverpool have been on his trail for over a year. 

He is a left-footed striker who can play across the front line and has already played for Malaga's first team in friendlies.

Kuki is being tracked by the some of the Premier League's big boys and could leave Malaga in the summer

Kuki signed his first professional contract at Malaga last summer and his release clause fee is set at £4.4million but that doubles should he make his first team debut.

City beat Real Madrid and Barcelona last year to sign 14-year-old Brahim Abdelkader Diaz from Malaga's academy set-up and are ready to challenge Chelsea and Liverpool for Kuki.

Chelsea are also tracking Anderlecht youngster Aaron Iseka. A 17-year-old striker who has already played 11 games for Anderlecht's senior team and has scored one goal.
