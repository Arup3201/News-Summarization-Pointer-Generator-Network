She may be better known as the daughter of a rock star with a penchant for parties but Georgia May Jagger shows off a more innocent side in her latest campaign.

The 22-year-old has been unveiled as the new face of jewellery brand Thomas Sabo and has been given a feminine, floral makeover for their SS14 campaign.

Shot by fashion photographer Ellen von Unwerth, the campaign is centred around the new range, which the luxury brand say symbolises 'inner balance and peace'.

Georgia May is the ultimate boho chick in floaty kaftans, draping beads and natural make-up.

Georgia May takes over the reigns from Poppy Delevingne, her close friend and the sister of her housemate, Cara.

The British model is also one of the 
faces of Rimmel London, and has starred in fashion campaigns for Hudson 
Jeans, Chanel, H&M, Miu Miu, Versace and Vivienne Westwood.

For
 H&M, Georgia posed with her mother Jerry Hall, who at her age had 
already appeared on the front cover of 40 magazines.

Not that Georgia hasn't carved out a 
name for herself out of the shadows of her top model mother and Rolling 
Stones father Mick Jagger.

She also landed another fashion campaign for Italian brand Sisley with her rocker boyfriend Josh McLennan.

Sir Mick Jaggerâ€™s daughter celebrated her 22nd birthday last month with model pals Cara Delevingne, 
Tyra Banks and Suki Waterhouse at The Palms Casino Hotel.
