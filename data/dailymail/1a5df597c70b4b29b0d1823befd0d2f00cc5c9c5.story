Four men were yesterday sentenced to death by hanging for the gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus.

An Indian court ruled the men should go to the gallows for the attack which left the 23-year-old woman with such severe internal injuries she died two weeks later.

The judge said the ultimate punishment was needed as a ‘strong deterrent’ after a case that ‘shocked the conscience’ of a nation.

The horrific attack last December led to violent protests across India and forced the country to confront its culture of violence against women, including introducing new laws to combat rape.

After the death penalty was announced, the wail of one of the four killers, 20-year-old Vinay Sharma, filled the tiny courtroom in Delhi. Sharma, an assistant at a gym, then broke down in sobs and was dragged out of
 the court, where police with riot gear had formed a barricade to keep 
crowds back.

The sentences were welcomed by the victim’s family and scores of people outside the court building in Delhi, who chanted ‘Justice,  justice’, as news of the punishment was relayed to them.

Even children were seen holding drawings and placards of the men being hung by a noose.

But legal experts warned it could be years before the four men exhaust the appeal process and are hanged.

Some even doubt whether the men will ever be executed, as the vast majority of death penalties are commuted to life in prison.

India’s Supreme Court has ruled the death penalty should be used only in ‘the rarest of rare cases’.

Although more than 100 people are sentenced to death in India in most years, only two people – both terrorists – have been executed in the country since 2004.

India is thought to have carried out around 50 executions since independence in 1947, although  there are 477 people on death row.

The sentencing was the climax of a seven-month trial, often held behind closed doors, that was punctuated dramatically by a fifth defendant, aged 33, hanging himself in his jail cell.

A sixth, who was under 18 at the time of the attack, was earlier sentenced to three years detention, the maximum allowed under juvenile law.

Prosecutors had called for the ‘harshest punishment’ to be given to Sharma, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and unemployed Mukesh Singh, in his early 20s, to signal that such attacks cannot be tolerated.

The victim, who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus, became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country where a rape is reported on average every 21 minutes and cases of molestation are common.

The 
woman, who came from a lower-middle class family and worked in a call 
centre while she studied, can not be named for legal reasons, but Indian
 media have dubbed her Nirbhaya, a Hindi word meaning fearless.

The defendants lived on the bottom rungs of India’s booming economy.

Nearly all came from families that had moved to Delhi in recent years from desperately poor villages, hoping to find jobs in the capital.

Judge Yogesh Khanna said: ‘These are the times when gruesome crimes against women have become rampant, and courts cannot turn a blind eye to the need to send a strong deterrent message to the perpetrators of such crimes.’

Demanding justice: Demonstrators have come out in force since the horrific fatal gang rape in December of a student on a bus. Four men have been sentenced to death, but their punishment has done little to act as a deterrence for the rapist of a four-year-old on a bus near Mumbai

The victim’s mother, who cannot be named under Indian laws guarding her daughter’s identity even after death, said: ‘Today we can breathe a little easier. I hope the conviction will deter people from committing such crimes in future.’

Defence lawyers had urged the court to ignore what they said was popular and political pressure for the harshest penalty.

'This
 is not the victory of truth. But it is the defeat of justice,' defence 
lawyer A.P. Singh shouted at the judge when the sentence was read out.

'The judge has taken the decision under political pressure without considering facts,' he told reporters later.

The
 country's interior minister, Sushilkumar Shinde, denied that there had 
been any political interference, telling a TV news channel: 'No judicial
 authority can be influenced by the government.'

The
 sentencing capped a seven-month trial, often held behind closed doors, 
that was punctuated dramatically by a fifth defendant hanging himself in
 his jail cell.

A 
sixth, who was under 18 at the time of the attack, was earlier sentenced
 to three years detention, the maximum allowed under juvenile law.

In
 November, India ended what many human rights groups had interpreted as 
an undeclared moratorium on capital punishment when it executed a man 
convicted for the 2008 militant attack on the city of Mumbai.

Three months later, it hanged a Kashmiri separatist for a 2001 militant attack on parliament.

'In
 the past year, India has made a full-scale retreat from its previous 
principled rejection of the death penalty,' said Meenakshi Ganguly, 
South Asia director of Human Rights Watch.

Prosecutors
 had called for the 'harshest punishment' to be given to Sharma, bus 
cleaner Akshay Kumar Singh, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, and unemployed 
Mukesh Singh for last December's murder to signal that such attacks 
cannot be tolerated.

The 
four men were found guilty of luring the woman onto a bus, raping and 
torturing her with a metal bar and then throwing her naked and bleeding 
onto the road. She died two weeks later.

Violent
 protests exploded in several cities after the crime, a reaction 
commentators and sociologists said reflected a deep well of frustration 
that many urban Indians feel over what they see as weak governance and 
poor leadership on social issues.

The
 government, seen as out of touch with the aspirations of the burgeoning
 urban middle class, was caught off guard by the protests.

The
 case led to the introduction of tougher rape laws in March, and for the
 first time open conversation about gender crime in television debates, 
social media and even Bollywood.

Still,
 sex crimes remain commonplace in India, and social commentators say 
patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a
 decade of rapid economic growth.

Comments
 on social media websites and elsewhere ahead of the sentencing 
suggested that popular opinion favoured executing the men, although a 
survey by CNN-IBN-The Hindu newspaper in July showed Indians were 
divided on the merits of capital punishment.

Although
 the Supreme Court ruled in the 1980s that the death penalty should be 
imposed only in the 'rarest of rare' cases, opponents say the reality is
 quite different.

Indian courts sentenced 1,455 prisoners to death between 2001 and 2011, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

There
 are 477 people on death row. Many have been there for years.

Human 
rights groups have been alarmed, however, by the vigour with which 
President Pranab Mukherjee, who took office in July 2012, has acted in 
clearing the backlog of clemency pleas. He has rejected 11, confirming 
the death penalty for 17 people.

Some
 women's rights groups and legal experts had opposed executing the Delhi
 attackers. Others have invoked the Gandhian principle that 'an eye for 
an eye makes the whole world blind'.

'Sending
 these four men to the gallows will accomplish nothing except short-term
 revenge,' Tara Rao, director of Amnesty International India said in a 
statement.

'While the 
widespread anger over this case is understandable, authorities must 
avoid using the death penalty as a 'quick-fix' solution. There is no 
evidence that the death penalty is a particular deterrent to crime, and 
its use will not eradicate violence against women in India.'
