Tourists and New Yorkers have been slammed for taking selfies while visiting the scene of last week's devastating gas explosion in the East Village.

The blast last Thursday set four buildings ablaze, killed two men and injured 25 people.

But some people believed it was still appropriate to smile and pose for a social media picture as emergency crews surrounded the charred site.

'Disgusting': Christina Freundlich, who describes herself as a political communications professional, was condemned online for posting this picture at the site of the East Village fire on Friday 

A group of young women were seen using a selfie stick in front of the flames. 

The photograph was posted to the Twitter account EventsPhotosNYC and drew a barrage of criticism.

One commenter said: 'Everything that’s wrong with NYC summed up in one photo.' 

Another of those condemned was Christina Freundlich, who describes herself as a political communications professional on Linkedin and was a Communications Director at the Iowa Democratic Party.

Ben Foecke, Executive Director of the Iowa Democratic Party, told the Daily Mail Online: 'Christina Freundlich left employment with the Iowa Democratic Party over thee weeks ago. March 6th was her last day on payroll. 

'Her actions since then are completely outside our control and oversight.'

Freundlich reportedly resigned to 'seek opportunities elsewhere.' 

She was also a field organizer for Barack Obama's Florida Campaign for Change in 2008. 

She uploaded an image of her giving a peace gesture in front of the police barricades surrounding the burnt-out part of the block. 

Some people said the photo was 'disgusting' while others told her to leave New York. 

A reporter from Spanish-language channel Univision was spotted by Newsday reporter Michael Chayes talking a selfie as the press gathered.

One social media user said: 'Disgraceful. Unprofessional. No place for a selfie in face of disaster.'

Other Instagram users who had taken the selfies quickly took them down when they realized their error in judgement.
