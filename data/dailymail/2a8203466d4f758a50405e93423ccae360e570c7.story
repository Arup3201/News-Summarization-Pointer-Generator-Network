Today show star Lisa Wilkinson has laughed off the controversy surrounding Natarsha Belling's jacket, saying she has the same item in her wardrobe.

The jacket worn by Belling, complete with its phallic-shaped neckline, created an online frenzy after the Network 10 presenter appeared on-air wearing it.

Wilkinson, apparently not put-off by the controversy, said she plans to wear her jacket tomorrow and called on other TV hosts to do the same.

Today show star Lisa Wilkinson has laughed off the controversy surrounding Natarsha Belling's jacket, saying she has the same item in her wardrobe

Wilkinson, apparently not put-off by the controversy, said she plans to wear her jacket tomorrow and called on other TV hosts to do the same

Wilkinson, who is no stranger to experimenting with her on-air wardrobe, said all TV hosts should wear the jacket if they have one

'The #p***sjacket! REALLY? Calling all TVhosts who have this jacket to wear it on air tomorrow. I will! #geez,' Wilkinson tweeted to her 125,000 followers.

The jacket, designed by Australian label Scanlan Theodore, was previously worn by Channel Seven’s Melissa Doyle in a fetching cream shade.

And the ‘Crepe Knit Double Peplum Jacket’, costing $550 is still available to buy on Scanlan Theodore’s website, after Doyle wore the design five days ago.

However, Nine News Brisbane reporter Eva Milic appears to be the original trendsetter, wearing a maroon jacket with the much talked about neckline, clinched at the waist by a belt, back in May.

Belling’s green jacket went viral after she wore it to present Network Ten's Eyewitness News and a photo of the outfit was then liked over 110,000 times on Facebook after the website Unilad posted the caption ‘once you see it, you cannot unsee it’.

'Once you see it, you cannot unsee it...': This photo of Natarsha Belling's green jacket has been shared thousands of times online

The image has also been shared over 7,000 times as the comments over Belling’s outfit rage on.

But phallic looking necklines are nothing new, as a 2010 photo of the ABC's Leigh Sales in a more extreme black number shows, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

Sales wore the cut out top while presenting Lateline and an eagle-eyed viewer uploaded a video of the clip to YouTube with the crude caption: 'ABC Lateline newsreader Leigh Sales wears a penis.' 

The bemusement and fascination with Belling's top appears to stem from the fact when you first look at the photo it’s hard to notice anything – but once the neckline’s shape is pointed out it’s hard to 'unsee' it.

Ruben Haywood wrote on Facebook, garnering 26,408 likes: ‘Like if you came here to find out what it is.’

Sarah Herbert wrote: ‘Yep, definitely cannot unsee this now.’ And Chris Thompson added: ‘Thank you, you have enlightened me on this picture.’

‘You legend I couldn't find what was happening but you've made me at ease now,’ Adam Baldwin said

And Lourens Odendaal realised: ‘Ooo that’s what it was… now I get it.’

Meanwhile, on Reddit, one commentator mused: ‘I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster about to burst from her chest.’ 

American anchor Dion Lim showed her support for Belling with the hashtag #anchorproblems

And another added: ‘I thought it was the slight crease in her v neck on the right side, yet the top was the same length… I was sure it wasn’t that so came to the comments.

‘I guess this means I'm growing up, because five years ago I’d see this straight away.’

On Tuesday, Belling received support from a fellow news anchor after the sartorial buzz reached the United States.

Reporter Dion Lim, who reports for the Ten News channel in Tampa, Florida, wrote: 'Oh c'mon. People ur reading too much into this! Anchor wears "phallic" jacket #anchorproblems.'

Facebook users were left bemused by the photo until looking up what the joke was about 

Sarah Herbert wrote: 'Yep, definitely cannot unsee this now'

Social media users laughed as they all realised what the joke was about 

One Facebook user pointed out 'you gotta have one to find one'

On Reddit, one commentator mused: 'I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster'

The 39-year-old is an Australian national news presenter on the Network Ten
