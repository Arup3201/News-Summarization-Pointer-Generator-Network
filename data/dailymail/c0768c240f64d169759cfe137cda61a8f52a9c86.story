Harrison Ford may have to be filmed from the waist up after breaking his ankle on the set of  Star Wars: Episode VII

Harrison Ford may have to be filmed from the waist up after breaking his ankle on the set of  Star Wars: Episode VII.

The 71-year-old suffered the break last Thursday after one of the hydraulic doors of the spacecraft Millennium Falcon fell on him and he had to be airlifted to the trauma unit at John 
Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

It
 is thought that as well as fracturing his ankle, he may also have 
suffered further injuries to his chest and pelvis – although he is said 
to be awaiting results of further tests to confirm the extent of any 
damage.

His son, Ben, has said that his father could need a plate and screws put into his ankle, the Times reports.

He also said that film crews may need to rearrange scenes in order to show the actor from the 
waist up over the coming weeks, or else reschedule filming.

The news 
comes after his wife, Calista Flockhart, best known for her starring role
 in sitcom Ally McBeal, confirmed she had flown from the US to be at her
 husband’s bedside.

Reprising his buccaneering role
 from the early films for Star Wars: Episode VII, it is believed Ford 
was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle when the incident
 occurred.

A source told The Mirror: 'The initial day or two after the 
accident it was hard to move things around but now we have had more time
 we can juggle things, bring some scenes forward and push others back.

'There are lots of other actors in the movie so it is not a disaster. We 
are confident the film can stay on schedule.

'At the moment it looks like Harrison is going to be off set for 6-8 weeks but the main priority is making sure he is OK.'

A Lucasfilm spokesman earlier confirmed 
shooting on the £200million film, which is due to be released in December next year,
 had resumed following the accident.

Star Wars: Episode VII, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, began filming in Abu Dhabi in mid-May.

The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi.
