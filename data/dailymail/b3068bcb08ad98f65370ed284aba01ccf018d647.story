Arrested: Self-proclaimed 'sadomasochist' Mia McCarthy, 23 (pictured) has been accused of raping her 52-year-old girlfriend after a night of 'rough sex'

A 23-year-old self-proclaimed 'sadomasochist' has been accused of raping her older girlfriend after a night of 'rough sex' in July.

Mia C. McCarthy was arrested on October 25 for allegedly punching, biting, choking and threatening to kill her girlfriend of nine months that day.

The unidentified victim also told officers McCarthy, from Lake Worth in Florida, raped her with a 'marital aid' during a night of 'rough sex' after the victim's birthday on July 21. 

The victim reported the attack to police on October 25 at Butterfly House, a sexual assault care center in Wellington, according to The Sun-Sentinel.

The victim said she'd had a violent fight with McCarthy that day.

She claimed McCarthy punched and scratched her, and choked her so hard she almost passed out.

Detectives found bruising, bite marks and scratches on the victim's neck.

She also said McCarthy
threatened her, saying, 'breathe or I'll kill you', which has left her 
in constant fear her former girlfriend will kill her.

The victim also claimed McCarthy assaulted her on July 21 after the couple partied at Delux, a Delray Beach nightclub, for the victim's birthday.

She said  McCarthy raped her with a 'marital aid' after smoking Kratom, a product the Drug Enforcement Administration describes as having opiate, sedative and euphoric effects.

'It was the first time McCarthy got rough with her and [the victim] did not know what to do,' the detective wrote in the report.

McCarthy, who was arrested on October 25, told investigators the couple enjoyed rough sex which sometimes left marks.

She said they didn't use safe words, 'no' meant 'yes' and she meant to stop but didn't. She said she apologized to the victim afterwards.

McCarthy faces charges of battery, domestic battery strangulation, attempted murder and sexual assault.

She remains in Palm Beach County Jail in lieu of $55,000 bail.
