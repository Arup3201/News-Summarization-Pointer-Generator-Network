A groundbreaking satellite that changes the way we see the world has been launched.

Called Sentinel-1A, it launched from French Guiana on 3 April and soon after mission controllers confirmed they had made contact with the craft, to cheering in the control room.

It is the first of a pair of satellites to launch into space, with the second - called Sentinel-1B - due to launch in 2015.

The pair is the first of the new Esa Sentinel family of satellites that will map our planet like never before.

Sentinel-1 is a polar-orbiting, all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services. Sentinel-2 is a high-resolution imaging mission that will provide imagery of vegetation, soil and water cover.

Sentinel-3
 is a multi-instrument mission to measure sea-surface topography, sea 
and land-surface temperature, ocean colour and land colour.

Sentinel-4 will be devoted to atmospheric monitoring.Sentinel-5 will monitor the atmosphere from polar orbit.

Sentinel-6 carries a radar altimeter to measure global sea-surface height, primarily for operational oceanography and for climate studies.

Sentinel 1-A launched on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Spaceport and will be placed into an Earth orbit between an altitude of 150 and 250 miles (250 and 400km).

Using radar imagery, it will soon begin mapping the surface of Earth.

Countries across Europe have spent â‚¬7.5bn (Â£6.2bn; $10.3bn) on the project that will run until the end of the decade.

Its sensitivity will allow it to detect changes in the climate - particularly those caused by human interference.

This will complement Esa's existing Copernicus Climate Change service, the goal of which is to respond to environmental and societal challenges associated with climate variability.

The Sentinel family of satellites will give scientists the data they need to determine the current state of our planet. It will also enable scientists to continue to fine-tune their predictions of Earth's future.

The overwhelming scientific consensus is that our climate will be damaged beyond repair if humanity does not stop harming the environment.

Sentinel-1A will be able to observe Earth both day and night, and in any weather conditions - a first for observation satellites.

This means that during disasters, including floods and earthquakes, the satellite could help provide support and relief for those on the ground.

'Sentinel-1A is using radar waves to image Earth's surface,' Mission Scientist Malcolm Davidson told MailOnline.

'It can penetrate through clouds and map
 Earth, so in the case of flooding this ability is important and it can 
generate maps of areas that are flooded.

'It can recognise, quite accurately, the difference between water and non-water.'

The 1-A, artist's impression pictured, will be the first of six satellites from Esa's new Sentinel family that will map and monitor Earth in unprecedented detail

The Sentinel-1A satellite, artist's impression pictured, will orbit Earth at an altitude of 150 and 250 miles (250 to 400km)

Climate studies and disaster relief aren't the only uses for the satellite.

Its exceptional level of accuracy means it can also provide information on miniscule details on Earth's surface.

From its orbit it is able to detect changes on Earth down to just a few millimetres.

This
 means it could theoretically predict when a building will collapse, 
detect emerging sinkholes in the ground, or study volcanic activity.

The Sentinel satellite should allow scientists to develop a forecast system for all volcanoes, including those that are remote and inaccessible.
The satellite will give a view of volcanoes and find the link between ground deformation and eruption.

Sentinel-1B will launch in 18 months and together the pair will map the entire Earth using radar imagery

It can also track the world's shipping lanes, something that has not yet been done by any satellite in Earth orbit.

'With hazards, such as sinkholes developing, we will be able to look where there will be structural damage over time,' continued Davidson.

'In extreme cases we could predict if a building could collapse or not.'

All of the Sentinel satellites are expected to be launched in the next few years, and together they will provide data that could be used for 20 to 30 years, according to Davidson.

Sentinel-1A is designed to last seven years but Davidson added that, like a fridge, 'you have a guarantee but I think as a consumer you usually hope it lasts longer.'
