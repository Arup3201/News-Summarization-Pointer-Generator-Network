A video which allegedly shows the final moments of a confrontation during which a suspect was tasered 18-times by two Missouri police officers has been made public.

In the disturbing footage, a man is seen to be writhing on the floor while two uniformed Springfield Police battle to restrain him.

One of the officers is seen to wield a taser and the distinctive crackle of its electric shock can be heard as the two police struggle with their suspect.

Restrained: The taser of one of the officers can clearly be seen being deployed in this undated video from Springfield, Missouri

The footage, presumably recorded on a cellphone, is being recorded by a relative of the man on the floor.

Shouting out to 'Justin', the man videoing is heard to say, 'Don't worry, about it, suing the f*** out of y'all,' as one of the officers uses his taser.

An older woman in a pink bath robe watches as the event unfolds, alternately screaming at the suspect to remain calm and at the police to let him go.

At one point the man recording the arrest shouts at the police that they are 'trying to kill' the suspect.

After this he repeats his advice to the suspect not to 'worry about' it because they are going to sue the police for their heavy handed actions.

As the suspect begins to tire, the two officers tell him to 'relax', as the older lady begins to shout that they need to take him to the hospital.

Suddenly, two more officers appear and approach the man filming the brawl - telling him to 'step away'.

The man's cellphone then appears to be wrestled over - as the footage comes to an abrupt end.
