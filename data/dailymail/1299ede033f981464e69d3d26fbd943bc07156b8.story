A hotelier has demanded an ancient clock stop chiming every 15 because it is keeping his customers awake.

The town hall clock in Bishops Castle in Shropshire which has rung every 15 minutes since the 18th century is now causing a storm on Facebook after one hotelier complained about the noise

The small market town in Shropshire attracts thousands of tourists every year, but Henry Hunter, of The Castle Hotel, has requested the traditional tolls be halted after dark.

The bells! Residents of Bishops Castle in Shropshire are divided over whether the bells should be silenced after dark

He says guests have told him that however much they love the town they will never return to Bishops Castle because of the clock’s 24-hour chiming.

He said: 'If anyone can come up with a genuine reason why the town clock should chime every 15 minutes throughout the night then I would like to hear it. Surly it would be beneficial to everyone living in close proximity to the clock to have it chime at most on the hour throughout the dead of night?'

But his request to the town council has been criticised by many residents who say the chimes are 'part of Bishops Castle’s character'.

Using their Facebook site the town council asked locals to leave their opinion on the clock asking the question: 'Does the noise of chiming bother people throughout the night or is it part of the ‘deal’ of living in a rural town with an historic town hall and clock?'

The Castle Hotel owner says guests have told him that however much they love the town they will never return to Bishops Castle because of the bells

Within days they received hundreds of responses with the majority in favour of keeping the chimes.

Olli Moon wrote: 'I always sleep better when I can hear it. It is definitely part of the town and it would be a real shame to see it go.'

Tracey Griffiths added: 'It is definitely part of the town. I love the chimes.'

Carol Woodhouse posted: 'I love the chimes. When I moved back here after 18 months away I really knew that I was home again when I heard the chimes. It has been a part of my growing up.'

But some have sympathy with Henry Hunter and the guests who stay at The Castle Hotel.

Benedict Rodway wrote: 'I agree that it is part of town, but "never annoyed anybody?" Try having your bedroom 25 feet from it!'

Using their Facebook site the town council has asked locals to leave their opinion on the clock because of the controversial chimes

Glyn Foulkes posted: 'I doubt anyone would support complete removal of the chimes as they are part of the fabric of Bishops Castle life, however surely the people who are closest to it are those affected the most at four in the morning. I would be interested to know why turning off the chimes between 1am and 6am is such a big deal as most of us are then asleep.'

Jane Carroll, a town councillor who runs a bed and breakfast in the town, has described claims that the clock chimes are having a detrimental effect on the local economy as 'absolute rubbish'.

She said: 'Bishops Castle has become increasingly popular as a holiday destination over the past 20 years and numbers continue to grow. Yet all this time the Town Hall clock has been donging away every 15 minutes, day and night.

'Bishops Castle Tourism has worked hard on tourism development over the years and has always had a policy of attracting visitors for what the town and area have to offer rather than changing things to suit visitors specifically. Any initiatives, be it good public footpaths, better signage, an excellent town website, promotion of town events and festivals and, of course, the renovation of the Town Hall should benefit residents as much as visitors.

'Altering the chiming of the Town Hall clock would go completely against this principle as most town centre residents want the clock chimes to stay as they are. They are a familiar and friendly background sound to our lives and, for many people, a very useful time keeper. Without the quarters, the chimes would be useless as the latter.

'Instead of complaining about the chimes, the accommodation providers and residents should be celebrating our historic Town Hall clock. It is part of the character of Bishops Castle and appreciated by many.'

The future of Bishops Castle’s Town Hall clock will be discussed at a meeting of the full council on September 10.
