Giving prisoners the right to vote will do nothing to stop them reoffending Chris Grayling insisted today.

The Justice Secretary claimed having a job and somewhere to live after leaving jail were more important factors in preventing them returning to a life of crime.

And he vowed that the British Parliament would be ‘sovereign’ in deciding whether to implement a controversial ruling from the European Court of Human Rights that inmates should be able to take part in elections.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insisted there was no evidence giving prisoners the vote would stop them reoffending when they were released

European judges have ruled that the Britain's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights.

In February 2012 the Commons called for the ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22, despite repeated warnings from Strasbourg.

Since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue, while stressing that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to decide whether or not to comply with ECHR rulings.

The government has sought to kick the issue into the long grass, by investigating a raft of options including allowing prisoners to vote during the last six months of their sentence.

Mr Grayling admitted the plan would be difficult to implement, because it is not always known so far in advance when a prisoner would be released.

Mr Grayling repeatedly told the justice select committee: 'Parliament is sovereign in these matters'

Giving evidence to the justice select committee, Mr Grayling repeatedly rejected the idea that being allowed to vote in elections from behind bars would do anything to prevent them committing a crime again after release.

Labour MP Paul Flynn pointed to South Africa, where he claimed prisoners were given the vote 'as a process of giving them some small responsibility'.

But Mr Grayling said: ‘I have not seen any evidence that suggests to me that introduction of votes for prisoners would have any material effect on reoffending rates.

‘My experience is that a house and a job are much more important.’

The prisoner voting row has been running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate.

Despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the European judges have continued to repeat their instructions.

A string of Tory MPs - led by the Prime Minister - are resisting demands from the European Court of Human Rights for some inmates to be granted the right to vote

In 2010, David Cameron said it makes him 'physically ill' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison.

In December last year the Prime Minister insisted Britain 'damned well shouldn't' be forced to comply with the European judges.

The government insists it is complying with the rule of law, despite delaying attempts to respond to the ruling.

Mr Grayling added: 'The worst thing we could do is implement a change inappropriately. Parliament is sovereign in these matters.

‘If we are to introduce votes for prisoners, it will have to be with the consent of Parliament.’

There are concerns that 2,300 compensation claims from prisons banned from voting have be reactivated by the ruling, costing the British taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds.

But Mr Grayling said: ‘The court has started that the process in a small number of cases. We don’t intend to play an active part in the court. We don’t believe that any compensation will be payable in the judgement, whatever the outcome.’
