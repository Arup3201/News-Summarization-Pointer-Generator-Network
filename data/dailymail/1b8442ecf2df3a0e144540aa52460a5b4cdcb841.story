This friendly bear cub raised a furry paw to wave at surprised animal lovers.

The young female grizzly bear made the cute gesture as she braved chilly glacier water to watch her mother catch salmon. Photographer Kevin Dietrich, 33, said he will remember the exciting moment forever.

It was also a nerve-wracking experience for the real estate broker, as the hungry mother bear swam towards him several times.

Mr Dietrich, who was with his brother on a trip to Chugach National Forest, Alaska, said: 'My reaction was one of pure excitement and disbelief. I've often thought about seeing a bear cub standing on its rear legs like a human does, but I truly didn't expect to ever get a photograph of it.

'I certainly never dreamed I'd get an image of one 'waving' at me while standing in a river waiting for it's mother to bring back a salmon. As the cub stood up I knew this was my opportunity to get a photograph I would cherish and remember for a lifetime.

'She made a few other motions with her paws and then returned all four feet to the ground. I have never seen a bear do this before but have heard stories.

'It was a unique experience and I was grateful I was able to capture it and also to have shared it with my brother. I feel the photo is as close to a one-off as you'll ever get. I have not seen another photo taken in the wild or captivity like it.

Photographer Kevin Dietrich, 33, said he will remember the exciting moment forever. He said the little cub was 'very excited and animated' as she waited for her mother to bring back food

'The colours, water, composition, environment and the story behind it make it one of a kind.'

Mr Dietrich, from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, U.S., was standing 40ft away from the bear as she took a dip in the 15ft deep river.

He added: 'Although the young bear cub approached the water with some speed she would not fully immerse herself in the cold, turqoise water. The mother bear left the shore and swam directly at us before diving to the bottom of the river in search of dying salmon.

'She would disappear for about 15 seconds and then appear randomly in front of us. Needless to say we were full of excitement and nervousness as we never knew where she was going to appear.

'She caught about seven salmon and the little cub was very excited and animated as she waited for her mother to bring back food to the shore. Once the mother caught a salmon, the youngster would sprint around the edge of the river to meet her and try to get her share of the food.

'It seems because of her high level of energy and desire to eat she was just bursting with excitement and couldn't resist giving us a wave.'
