Steven Gerrard and Phil Jagielka stood shoulder-to-shoulder and paid a poignant tribute by releasing 96 red balloons in memory of Liverpool fans who died at Hillsborough.

Wednesday marked the 26th anniversary of the disaster that unfolded during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and the annual memorial service was typically poignant and emotional.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, chief executive Ian Ayre and the entire Liverpool squad attended, along with a host of former players including Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Phil Thompson, Robbie Fowler, John Aldridge - who gave the second reading - and Jamie Carragher.

There was also significant representation from Everton, with manager Roberto Martinez joining his captain Jagielka and club ambassador Graham Stuart, who also gave a reading.

An inquest into the tragedy is ongoing and Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, said: ‘There is still a job to be done.
