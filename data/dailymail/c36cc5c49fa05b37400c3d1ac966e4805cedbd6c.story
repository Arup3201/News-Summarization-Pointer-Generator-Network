A nurse who used donations to her ward to buy alcohol for patients and pay for staff parties has been allowed to keep her job.

Audrey Marshall, 43, was cleared of misconduct by the Nursing and Midwifery Council after admitting accepting money from four patients families but failing to record them.

The hearing revealed it was quite normal for hospital workers to informally hold cash donations.

Ms Marshall was backed by the council who said any fair-minded observer would be unconcerned by her conduct. Her colleagues told the hearing she was a well-respected nurse.

Ms Marshall declined to comment after the hearing on Friday, but, in a statement submitted to the council she said: 'I've punished myself more than anyone else could and lost a huge part of who I am.'

The nurse worked at an unnamed hospital in the NHS Lothian area between 2009 and 2011 when her spending was discovered. She was later demoted and given a warning.

The case was referred to the police and after appearing in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court in 2012 Ms Marshall was acquitted of both theft and embezzlement.

The sheriff said it was clear that although Ms Marshall had broken hospital accounting rules she was not dishonest.

An investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council also found Ms Marshall had not acted dishonestly. However, it pointed out spending donations on staff parties and nights out was serious enough to constitute misconduct.

At the hearing, NHS Lothian was said to have changed its approach to donations and had offered an amnesty to staff who held on to cash gifts without recording them.

A letter from the clinical director of gynaecology at NHS Lothian stated that from 2007 to the beginning of 2013, 'I was aware of a number of similar funds' held informally by ward and department staff in the same way as Ms Marshall had.

Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw voiced concerns over the case, saying: 'When money is donated to wards, the last thing families expect is for it to be blown on a staff night out. Now this case has come to light, there is no excuse for it to happen again.'

The council boards Jane Ferguson said all donations handed to staff in NHS Lothian must be passed to the foundation.

NHS Lothian told the hearing it did not know how much donated money staff held informally.
