I’ve never been so angry watching a game as a neutral. My initial shock and fascination at what was unfolding soon turned to disgust at half-time. It wasn’t just Brazil’s lack of defensive ability, their lack of interest in defending was a disgrace.

As a player I have had bad games and suffered heavy losses (never 7—1 though!) and walked away wishing the outcome had been different.

But from 2-0 down the lack of leadership and character was something I don’t think I’ve ever seen at the top level.

It started with Marcelo, who has been poor from game one, and can’t defend.

He was trying to be clever with a step-over,  followed by a blind pass. Germany broke, he scampered back and conceded the corner and was then apologising.

I’m still astonished that Atletico Madrid’s Filipe Luis is not in the squad never mind the team as I didn’t see a better left back in Europe last  season — or in this competition to date.

The corner for the first goal was a well-worked routine from the Germans with Thomas Muller losing David Luiz, who was blocked off. You perhaps can excuse him for that one.

But how can anyone try to explain the overall defensive performance of the Brazilian captain? I have never been a fan, then warmed to him in this tournament, but… that was as bad a central defensive performance as I’ve seen from someone at this level.

In my preview to the game, I mentioned his leadership qualities: rallying the crowd, taking a penalty, consoling players after they’d missed theirs. That’s the easier bit of leadership.

The difficult part is on the pitch: organising the players around you, cajoling your team-mates, making people around you perform better, setting an example in times of trouble. He didn’t do that. Instead he allowed Brazil to sink.

He was running all over the pitch, failing to hold his position. Then went for the oldest trick in the book, trying to hurt German players to show the crowd how determined he was.

He caught Miroslav Klose with an elbow twice, then took a wild swing at Muller in the second half — that was embarrassing.

Certain centre backs are leaders, while others need to be led. After this game, it is obvious what category he is in!

He shoots, he scores: Germany midfielder Toni Kroos nets his side's third past after more poor defending

Watching the first half, as Germany raced into a 5-0 lead, took me back to how people must have reacted when watching Liverpool’s first half against AC Milan in  Istanbul, where it actually becomes painful to watch.

The half-time whistle reminded me of the dressing room that night — but we were only 3-0 down!

Our dressing room then was in a state of shock, heads bowed with embarrassment. But that night in Istanbul we somehow rallied each other.

Then, in the second half, with a combination of determination  and some tactical changes, we got ourselves back into the game.

To be fair, Luiz Felipe Scolari made changes and Brazil should have scored a couple before Germany made it 6-0.

The Germans must take huge credit for their work-rate and  intelligence. More importantly, their composure in a semi-final of a World Cup was remarkable.

They scored three goals, from Klose, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira, as if playing a training game, passing the ball around the penalty box.

The goals and intelligence of Muller, the strings being pulled by Kroos on his 50th cap — and both are only 24 — were impressive, but we should also mention the beautifully-timed tackles and assists of Phillip Lahm, who is the best full back in the game, and the imposing features in goals of the outstanding Manuel Neuer.

People have said the only thing missing from this tournament is an outstanding team, but I think we’ve seen one now.

No way back: Oscar and Fred stand in the centre circle - something they did all too frequently on Tuesday night

Too little, too late: Oscar scored a consolation for the host nation in the dying minutes but it was pointless

Don’t forget they beat Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal 4-0 in the first game and this team have a strong influence from Bayern Munich similar to the one Barcelona had on the Spanish team over the last few years.

Bayern have won eight  trophies in the past two years and Germany now look odds on to add an international trophy to that domestic haul.

The 1-7 result will be remembered a lot longer in Brazil than in  Germany. The 1950 Brazil team were always reminded of their defeat by Uruguay in the final and they only lost 2-1!

This result has shocked the world.
