George Osborne famously started wearing a sleep-monitoring wristband when he was given one for his birthday in May.

But it seems the gadget – designed to check its wearer gets a good night’s sleep – may do more harm than good.

Experts suggest the devices – which cost around £100 – give buyers an extra thing to worry about.

Sleep gadgets can make a person sleep less well because they become obsessed with sleep and worry too much about, experts say (stock image)

Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, from the London Sleep Centre, said: ‘People can become obsessed about their sleep through these gadgets, worrying about it and in turn getting less decent sleep.’ 

The wristbands link up with a smartphone app to allow users to monitor their every toss and turn in bed.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed he used his wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime.

Former Education Secretary Michael Gove was also spotted wearing a Jawbone wristband – leading to speculation that senior ministers were struggling to sleep at night.

Studies claim those who sleep for less than six hours a night have a risk of high blood pressure three times greater than those who get more than six hours. 

Women who sleep less than four hours a night are twice as likely to die from heart disease as those who sleep longer.

Dr Ebrahim added: ‘Anything that allows you to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning is what you should be aiming for, which is generally between six and nine hours’ sleep.

‘But it's not all about time, it's about the quality of the sleep, whether you complete cycles.’ 

Research has suggested lack of quality sleep is linked to diabetes, obesity and cancer, not to mention deterioration of mental health and memory.

Conversely, sleeping too long has also been shown to cause issues.
