Ahead of World Cup combat in Brazil, the Republic of Ireland blew a chance to provide England manager Roy Hodgson with another encouraging pointer.

Six days after holding Italy scoreless, Ireland were a goal in front through Kevin Doyle, and a man to the good, against Costa Rica deep into the second half of the Freedom Cup and seemed set fair for only their second win under Martin O’Neill.

But then, things went horribly awry. After Celso Borges converted a penalty in the 64th minute, Robbie Keane saw a penalty two minutes later saved by replacement ‘keeper Patrick Pemberton – it was only Keane’s second miss for Ireland.

On a 
tempestuous night, which saw a spattering of cards, missiles thrown and 
post-match invasions by fans, Hodgson will have noted another incident 
which, unwittingly, may be of benefit to England.

After 
Riccardo Montolivo’s broken shin in Craven Cottage, Giancarlo Gonzalez, 
the Costa Rica central defender, faces a World Cup ban after being sent 
off for violent conduct following an ugly aerial tangle with Doyle 
before half-time.

It was 
Ireland who struck first through Doyle in the 18th minute, when the 
Wolves striker placed a glancing header into the bottom corner following
 a pin-point cross by Marc Wilson.

Doyle’s 
goal was almost fated as the PPL Stadium is under the shadow of the 
Commodore Barry Bridge, named after the founder of the US Navy and, like
 Doyle, a native of County Wexford.

It was Doyle’s 13th international goal and his first since September, 2012, as he seized his recall moment.

Ireland 
seemed comfortable at half-time but the positioning of James McClean at 
left-back for the injured Wilson was a weakness which Costa Rica seized 
on.

After 64 
minutes, they were level when Celso Borges smashed in a penalty, awarded
 against 'keeper David Forde for catching the busy Marco Urena as he 
surged into the box.

Improbably,
 Ireland were gifted a chance to restore their lead when referee Castro 
awarded a soft penalty after Stephen Quinn tumbled under a challenge by 
Heiner Mora.

But Keane, complete with trademark shuffle, was thwarted as Pemberton dived correctly to his right to push the ball away.

Ireland had time to regroup but apart from a late flurry, the win which manager Martin O’Neill was seeking, eluded them.

With one win in six games under O'Neill, Portugal  are up next for Ireland in New Jersey on Tuesday night.
