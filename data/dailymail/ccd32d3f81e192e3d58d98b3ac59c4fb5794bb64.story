When it became clear that Roy Keane's second autobiography had reached the shelves early, two former Manchester United players got in touch to make enquiries.

'What has he said about me?' was the rather anxious tone.

Typical Keane. Still making people nervous. As his first book told us 12 years earlier, when Keane cuts you, he cuts deep.

This, however, is a different book to the first, a book with more layers, a book that reveals much more of Keane than perhaps we would ever have expected.

The headline chapters are there in newsprint  and we shouldn't be surprised. Over the last decade or so, the 43-year-old has lived a rich sporting life and the former Manchester United captain was always unlikely to leave scores unsettled.

But beneath the froth and the cherry-picked anecdotes, Keane presents us with a remarkably complex self-portrait of a man for whom the closure of a playing career left him troubled, physically vulnerable and, most interestingly of all, scared.

Offered the chance to play for Real Madrid in the wake of his exit from United in November 2005, Keane actually took a call from Emilio Butragueno while he sat on the toilet but here the comedy ends.

'I didn't go,' Keane writes.

'It was fear that decided me. Fear of the unknown.

'As usual, I was looking at what may go wrong.

'Hindsight is a f**ker of a word.'

If his first book – memorable as it was – served to reinforce Keane's deliberately constructed image of driven, cold-eyed, one-track hard man, this one questions those stereotypes quite starkly.

As he writes himself: 'My mid-life crisis has been going on for years'.

Some life decisions are taken on whims. For example, he accepted his first pundits gig with ITV after something he read in his horoscope. Ultimately, though, TV work left him feeling 'like a failure', as did a brief foray on to the celebrity circuit after his sacking from Ipswich.

'Playing football with f*****g JLS, that was never my masterplan,' he says.

'I didn't like what I was becoming.'

Clearly, Keane's departure from Old Trafford – and his manner of it – has stayed with him. He has tried to cut his emotional ties with the club but he has failed. Similarly with his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

Keane is withering in his assessment of Ferguson, at times unstintingly so. He hints at selfishness and double standards in Old Trafford's great patriarch. Equally, though, the search for approval and recognition in a mentor goes on.

After Keane's Sunderland team were drubbed 4-0 at home by United in 2007, Ferguson offers him a player on loan.

'It was the one time he showed me – I suppose – affection,' Keane reflects.

'He caught me off guard. I thought: "He actually cares, a bit".'

Here, Keane points clearly to his own insecurity, vulnerability even. It is a theme of the book.

The image of one of the great footballers of our time aimlessly kicking a ball against the inside of his garage door in Cheshire as he waited for the phone to ring post-United is a sombre one. 

Meanwhile the one of Keane lying on his hotel bed in searing agony from his hip problem after refusing to admit he wasn't ready to train on his first day at Celtic points to a peculiar willingness to please. 

'I didn't want to let anyone down,' he says.

Equally the admission that he never personalised his office at Sunderland is telling.

At his rented flat in County Durham he didn't have a TV and ate baked beans and pot noodles.

'If things go badly I want to be able to clear it out quickly,' he writes of his office in the north-east.

'One box. Ready for a quick getaway.'

Ferguson had a relationship that deteriorated with the Republic of Ireland international while Manchester United continued to win major trophies 

Keane (organising a wall to include David Bellion, Jesper Blomqvist, Nicky Butt, Giggs and Kieran Richardson) was disparaging towards his team-mates at United   

Keane writes about a range of topic in his autobiographyThe Second Half

The first autobiography painted Keane as a loner who deliberately didn't have the mobile phone numbers of his United team-mates. This time, he emerges as fundamentally more sociable – albeit in his own way – and as a man who worried – and cared – much more about what team-mates and rivals thought of him than he ever let on.

Certainly, the presentation of Keane the worrier – worrying about retirement, his public image, his friends – is new.

'Over the years I have played different roles,' he admits.

'Sometimes I don't know what role I'm supposed to be playing.'

At Sunderland, it appears that he reconciled that dilemma, at least in part. For a time, he was successful. The essence of Keane remained – deliberately asking staff to set up a tactics boards at half-time so he could kick them over in 'rage' – but subtleties emerged, too.

Ground staff were invited to eat with the players rather than in their old hut at the far end of the training ground, he used mental tricks to remember names of cleaning staff while he gave his own Championship medal in 2007 to a reserve goalkeeper who hadn't qualified for one of his own.

There are clear shades of Ferguson, here, of course. His shadow hangs over huge swathes of the book, whether Keane realises it or not.

Equally, there are pockets of 'old Keane' too.

His admission that he was briefly 'glad' to hear one of his own players had suffered a heart attack while on loan at Leicester – 'It would deflect from our own woeful performance that night' – was something he may regret revisiting in print while his return to the Alf-Inge Haaland incident of lore feels gratuitous.

There are, however, moments of splendid self-deprecation here.

Keane tells how his first team-talk as manager of Sunderland focussed on a goalkeeper 'playing' for the opposition who he hadn't realised had been sold two weeks earlier. The first single he ever bought was Karma Chamaeleon by Culture Club – maybe he should have left that bit out.

Certainly if Keane's first book – indeed his whole career – seemed designed to cultivated an image then this sequel has confronted, questioned and perhaps even dismantled it. It is this - the book's great honesty - that makes it so worthwhile.

'I have always been a bit wary and I hate that about myself,' he admits.

'When I was a player I shut doors on myself, now I don't have to.'
