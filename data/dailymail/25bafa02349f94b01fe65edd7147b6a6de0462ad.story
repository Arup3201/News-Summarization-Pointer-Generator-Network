If you're out at the beach this weekend - like most Americans hope they will be - it might be an idea to look up.

About 5,000 feet up, actually.

That's about where Belgian photographer Antoine Rose will be making his works of art.

The self-taught snapper initially started out taking pictures of kiteboarders as head photographer of the Kiteboarding World Cup, according to Fast Company.

Then, while covering finals in Ipanema and Copacabana, Rose turned his lens from the water to the beach - and that's where the magic happened.

Think this is a painting? It's not: Aerial photographer Antoine Rose takes pictures of crowded packed beaches from 5,000 feet in the air

Cartoonish: Rose claims that, save some basic touch ups, his photos are not edited or choreographed

The idea came to rose during a trip to Ipanema and Copacabana, where he was covering the Kiteboarding World Cup as head photographer

The series of photos has been titled 'Up In The Air' and is years in the making

Most of Rose's most recent work was shot in The Hamptons

Intricate: The photos come off as landscape-type paintings

Not your average occupation: A great deal of safety is required for the work Rose does

While the resultant photos appear heavily edited - almost cartoon-like - Rose said he does not do anything to his shots, save a few minor touch ups on PhotoShop.

Also he does have anything to do with how the umbrellas, chairs or people are placed - that's just natural, he says.

Most of his more recent pieces have been taken in The Hamptons and Miami, both of which are known for their colorful umbrellas and swimwear fashions.

However, while the pictures are pretty and celebratory, there are many dangers to the work Rose does.

Dangling out of a helicopter in order to get the shots takes many safety measures.

Additionally, Rose told Fast Company he once had a close call with an Air Canada plane.

The heights he travels to in order to capture the right photos is alot higher than routes helicopters typically take, and takes proper precaution from the pilot.

Roses's photographs can be found in prestigious private and corporate collections

Some of the pieces are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York

Puzzling: The effect of the photos almost makes the people and objects on the ground look like puzzle pieces

Rose also says that his work is part anthropological, because it documents certain human behaviors, such as the way people gather

From above, the crowds that gather on the beaches of New York and Miami take on geometries that make each beachgoer's place in the sand seem almost methodical
