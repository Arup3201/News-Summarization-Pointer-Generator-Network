British parents are being left out in the cold when it comes to buying Frozen merchandise after it emerged retailers are charging them up to twice as much for toys than in the United States.

The hugely popular Disney franchise was responsible for last Christmas's most popular toy- the Snow Glow Elsa- and demand for Frozen dolls, games and clothing shows no sign of abating.

But it was revealed today that if Brits want to pick up the sell-out doll, which can move, light up and play Frozen's hit song Let it Go- they are expected to pay more than £12 extra than their American counterparts.

We have compared prices for Disney's Frozen merchandise and found that British parents are being charged almost double the US prices for toys

The toy is on sale on Toys R Us' UK website for £34.99 but across the Atlantic, the same doll is selling  for a bargain £22.97.

An Olaf pull-apart figure is more than twice the price in the UK at £14.99 than in the US at £6.56. Elsa's Musical Snow Wand is also half the cost in the States where shoppers are charged just £7.87 compared to £12.99 in the UK.

But the biggest saving can be made on the Frozen Crystal Kingdom Vanity Unit which is a staggering £23.89 more expensive to buy in Britain than abroad at £59.99 compared to £36.10.

The Consumer Action Group have slammed the pricing as unfair as British are expected to pay more for the same goods as their counterparts.

The hugely popular Disney film following snow queen Elsa and her sister Anna, has created a huge demand for merchandise

A Toys R Us spokesman told the Sun: 'Margins in the UK and US tend to be the same but it is not unusual to find manufacturers having different cost prices. 

'Some of this will be down to different rates of VAT and taxes between the UK and US.'

Sales of Frozen toys hit an all-time high in the run-up to Christmas outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released.

Even now the demand for Frozen merchandise shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, sales have increased this week as pictures from the seven minute short follow-up film Frozen Fever were released.

The film's storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter.

Frozen, which subverts the fairy-tale premise that a princess's primary purpose should be to bag a handsome prince, picked up two Oscars for best song and best animated feature. 

But even more startling than its critical acclaim was its commercial success. It overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion.

Meanwhile, its soundtrack- encapsulated by Elsa's show-stopping, infuriatingly catchy ballad Let It Go- stayed at the top of the American Billboard charts for 13 consecutive weeks and went onto become a social media phenomenon.
