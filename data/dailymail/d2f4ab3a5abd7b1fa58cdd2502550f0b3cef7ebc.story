Motorists using the M25 have had to put up with road works every day for the past three years, new figures reveal.

The London orbital route has never been without a lane closure or diversion since May 2010, when the Coalition came  to power promising to reduce motorway congestion.

The M1 has fared little better. It has been cone-free for only four days in that time, while the M4 has managed to chalk up just 12 days without disruption.

At the other end of the scale is the M2. Drivers using the main route to the Channel ports have enjoyed 336 days without roadworks.

Next best performer is the M23 between London and Gatwick Airport, where motorists have been spared maintenance and upgrading disruption on 297 days.

Motoring organisations accepted the need for repairs but said delays could be reduced by better co-ordination of works to avoid repeated closures and reduced-speed stretches.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘The Highways Agency must recognise the impact works have on road users.

The Highways Agency, which released the information, was  unable to say when the M25  was last free of roadworks

‘Even limited lane closures can impact large numbers of people and the bill in terms of drivers’ time and money quickly ratchets up.’ The Highways Agency, which released the information following a Freedom of Information request, was  unable to say when the M25  was last free of roadworks.

The 117-mile motorway  is currently undergoing a £129 million operation to renew the central reservation barrier between Junction 5 at Sevenoaks and Junction 6 at Godstone. The work is due to finish in the spring of 2015.

The Highways Agency said: ‘The M25 is one of the busiest motorways in Europe and we have a robust proactive maintenance programme to ensure it remains at a high standard.’
