A former high-ranking Obama administration official writes in his forthcoming memoir that the White House was 'so eager to rid itself of Iraq' that advisers steered the president toward withdrawing all U.S troops instead of trying to ink an agreement to let them legally stay past 2011.

Leon Panetta, Obama's first CIA director and his second Defense secretary, writes in the book 'Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace' that Obama's inner circle lacked a sense of urgency about finalizing a deal with Iraq's then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

'To my frustration,' Panetta writes, 'the White House coordinated the negotiations but never really led them,' leaving the Defense and State Departments to proceed 'without the President’s active advocacy.'

Leon Panetta, Obama's first CIA director and his second Defense Secretary, now says the White House is to blame for failing to iron out an agreement that would have left some American troops in Iraq

With the ISIS terror army filling the power vacuum left by the US after 2011, Obama has been forced to return to Iraq with airstrikes while negotiating with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi (left, shown Sept. 24 at the UN)

The U.S. wasn't willing to allow soldiers and Marines to stay past Obama's drawdown deadline – the end of 2011 – without A Status Of Forces Agreement, which would have protected U.S. military personnel from legal prosecution by Iraq's notoriously arbitrary and vicious justice system.

Al-Maliki, according to Panetta, insisted that his nation's divided and fiercely sectarian Parliament needed to debate and approve any such agreement.

That, he writes in 'Worthy Fights,' put the deal in limbo and left the White House wringing its hands even though the leaders of all Iraq's skirmishing factions wanted the U.S. to stay, in some form, as a backstop against opportunistic jihadis.

'To this day,' Panetta insists, 'I believe that a small U.S. troop presence in Iraq could have effectively advised the Iraqi military on how to deal with al-Qaeda’s resurgence and the sectarian violence that has engulfed the country.'

Time magazine published a short excerpt from the book on Wednesday evening.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday during her regular daily briefing that the U.S. 'didn’t have the requirements needed to leave our troops there' at the time.'

The administration, she said, 'was certainly committed to doing everything we could to secure the requirements needed to have forces there. Obviously, we were unable to do that.'

Panetta disagrees, writing that the administration ignored 'leverage' the U.S. had over al-Maliki in the form of reconstruction aid dollars. 

'My fear, as I voiced to the President and others,' he writes, 'was that if the country split apart or slid back into the violence that we’d seen in the years immediately following the U.S. invasion, it could become a new haven for terrorists to plot attacks against the U.S.'

'I privately and publicly advocated for a residual force that could provide training and security for Iraq’s military.'

But although the Joint Chiefs of Staff and military commanders on the ground in Iraq agreed, 'the president’s team at the White House pushed back, and the differences occasionally became heated.'

'Those on our side,' Panetta says, 'viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests.'  

The self-styled Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has murdered tens of thousands and turned millions more into refugees as it plows through Iraw and Syria

Panetta writes in his book that he and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey urged the president to arm Syria's moderate rebels in 2012 but Obama demurred – only to do it in 2014 after the civil war there intensified

Panetta's book ruffled its first feathers two weeks ago when '60 Minutes' reported that he and the rest of Obama's national security team had urged the president in 2012 to arm moderate Syrian rebel groups hostile to dictator Bashar al-Assad.

Obama, Panetta wrote, overruled them all.

More recently, with two additional years of civil war in the rear-view mirror, Obama has secured $500 million from Congress to 'train and equip' the rebels. 

'I think that would've helped' in 2012, Panetta told 60 Minutes' during a Sept. 21 broadcast.

'And I think, in part, we pay the price for not doing that in what we see happening with ISIS.'

He also hinted at his belief that a less-complete troop pullout at the end of 2011 'would've given us greater leverage over Iraq's government.

Leon Panetta, who ran the CIA and the Defense Department for Obama, argued for a 'residual force' to stay behind in Iraq to stabilize the country

The White House, he writes in a new book, fell down on the job and didn't negotiate a security agreement with the al-Maliki government in Baghdad

Obama has said it was Iraq, not the US, that scuttled any chance for American troops to stay past 2011

The power vacuum left when Obama ordered servicemen and women home has been filled by ISIS and other al-Qaeda offshoots

Panetta said two weeks ago that Obama ignored his advice to arm Syria's moderate rebel groups in 2012 – a move that the president now embraces
