Leeds denied Middlesbrough both their pizzas and a point on Saturday as debutant Billy Sharp answered Massimo Cellino's call to score some quick goals.

Boro's request for the Italian dish to be left in their dressing room at full-time was turned down by Leeds - surprising considering they are heavily under the Sardinian influence of owner Cellino - but they had more to worry about than pizza as Sharp's 88th-minute debut goal condemned them to a 1-0 loss.

Sharp signed from Southampton on Wednesday as Cellino responded to Leeds' opening-day defeat at Millwall and was immediately told by the former Cagliari owner to 'hurry up and score some goals'.

Winner! Billy Sharp wheels away after scoring the winner on his Leeds debut against Middlesbrough

The 28-year-old left it until two minutes from time to obey the command but was in the right place at the right time to finish after Tomas Mejias failed to hold Michael Tonge's shot.

The late drama will have left a sour taste in Middlesbrough's mouth for it was they who did most of the running throughout and, to almost everyone in the ground, scored a legitimate opener through Albert Adomah which was ruled out.

It was Sharp who would have the final say, though, getting due reward for a grafting performance which nearly brought about a goal after only two minutes.

He ran on to a Souleymane Doukara flick and got into the box, only for Mejias to get out and smother at his feet. The ball then came free and fell to Nicky Ajose who, from 10 yards out, should have scored and not hit the recovering Daniel Ayala on the line.

That was as good as it got for Leeds in the early stages and they were soon being pinned back by a Middlesbrough side who passed the ball round at a pace quicker than United could deal with and really should have been ahead 26 minutes in.

Liam Cooper failed to deal with a long throw into the box and turned to see Adomah overhead kick his half-clearance beyond Marco Silvestri. It looked a clean goal but referee Stuart Atwell had spotted an infringement and chalked it off. 

Jason Pearce was the next man to put his body on the line to keep Leeds level, diving in front of a Lee Tomlin effort as the hour approached, with Warnock then displaying his defensive nous once more to nip in and block of Kike as he ran through.

Leeds' best chance of getting something appeared to be under the suspect handling of Mejias who never looked comfortable under a cross and, with 11 minutes left he failed to reach a Luke Murphy centre but Sharp was unable to punish him from six yards.

But the former Doncaster man was on the spot as time ran down, showing the required poise to slot in after Mejias allowed Tonge's drive to slip away from him. 

Tight affair: Leeds' Stephen Warnock tackles Boro's Albert Adomah in what was a closely fought match  

Unfortunate: Middlesbrough were unlucky to have a goal chalked off before falling behind late on
