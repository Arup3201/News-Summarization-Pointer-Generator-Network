Most parents can’t wait to fill their Facebook pages with endless snaps of their newborn baby or tiny toddler.

And now taking pictures of your child has never been easier, thanks to the new Baby Selfie app created by software developer and doting father Matthew Pegula.

Attracting your baby’s attention with rattling sounds you can custom yourself, and animal pictures, once the smartphone is picked up and touch detected, it takes the picture in colour and stores it on your phone.

Pegula, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a software developer and founder of photo sharing app Hitchedpic, used his six-month-old daughter as the face of Baby Selfie.

He tells Charlotte Lytton of The Daily Beast that he wanted to facilitate a 
'mash up' of his roles at work and home by creating the app.

'Baby 
Selfie started out as a much more ambitious project that was going to 
try to determine when a baby was smiling, and report back to parents 
what the baby liked,' he says.

The Baby Selfie app attracts the baby with sounds and pictures, then automatically snaps and stores a photo

'But as I was working on that, the much 
simpler idea of Baby Selfie arose, and seemed like a good starting point
 to gauge interest.'

The 
app, which costs 60p to download to any Smartphone with a front-facing 
camera, describes itself as ‘peek-a-boo with a camera twist' and uses customisable drawings and fun
 sounds to grab your baby's attention and 'surprise' them.

The images and sounds capture the baby’s reaction, producing what Pegula says will be a 'unique, unexpected photo that you’ll love to 
share.’

Using rattling sounds, which you can custom design using the smartphone’s settings, animated pictures of owls, puppies and other animals will appear to attract the baby’s attention.

Once they touch the screen, the camera identifies where your baby is and takes a quick snap.

A message then pops up on your homescreen so you know how many photos were taken, and where they are stored (Baby Selfie automatically saves them to your phone’s gallery).

Pegula told the Washington Post that he expected some ‘eye-rolling’ from cynics.

'Hopefully people realise it’s all in good fun and can provide parents with some fun photos,' he said.

'I think it’s good because it engages parents and babies with the screen, it’s not really something where you can park your kid in front of it and walk away.'

In an age where we are seemingly obsessed by selfies (and pet selfies, butt selfies, exercise selfies...), it was only a matter of time before the Baby Selfie was invented.

But Pegula is quick to point out that the app is more of a hobby for him than a solid investment.

'No one is getting rich off of Baby Selfie,' he told The Daily Beast.

'We've sold enough to buy my daughter a box or two of Pampers so far, so I'm happy with the results of my little weekend project.'

Baby Selfie may be the first tool for photo-loving youngsters, but it's just part of the growing trend of apps to help ease pregnancy and parenthood. Bellabeat Global,
 a 'pregnancy social platform,' is currently being developed in the US 
and will allow users to share their baby's heartbeat.

Meanwhile Oogababy
 the self-proclaimed 'Instagram for babies,' allows parents to chart 
everything from new pictures to their child's weight, height and head 
circumference.
