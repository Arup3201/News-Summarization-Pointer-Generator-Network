Thanks to an exhibition at a London gallery, beautiful vintage photos from space have been unearthed for all of mankind to observe.

The show, named 'For all Mankind', at the Breese Little Gallery is a collection of over 100 images from Nasa's stellar past from the 1960's up until the 1980s.

The images are nostalgic imprints from the Gemini missions, the Mars Vikings, the Jupiter Voyager and other groundbreaking moments of space exploration, reports the Huffington Post.

The images display rocket liftoffs, surreal close-ups of planets within our solar system, and even mind-blowing photos of Earth from thousands of miles away.

'The exploration of space is undoubtedly one of the single most important endeavors in humanity’s quest for self-knowledge' says Breese Little.

The exhibit comes at a time when space tourism is possible after Virgin CEO Richard Branson pioneered Virgin Galactic and people have already begun serving seats on the tourist space carrier.

'The ennobling rhetoric employed by JFK to launch the American space program has been superseded by a new reality', says little.

The photos taken by man, woman, and machine will be on display until February 22 of 2014-one of them is the first Earthrise ever to be witnessed by human eyes.
