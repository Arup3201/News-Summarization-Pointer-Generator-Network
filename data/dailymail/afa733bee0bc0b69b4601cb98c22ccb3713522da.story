Claim: British manufacturer Dyson, founded by inventor and entrpreneur Sir James Dyson, has filed proceedings at the High Court, alleging that rival group Bosch obtained company secrets

The German technology giant Bosch paid an engineer working at its British rival Dyson £11,500 to leak details of its revolutionary digital motors, it was claimed yesterday.

The mole worked for Dyson for two years, during which he was providing secret information about the motors to a senior Bosch executive, it was alleged.

Dyson, founded by inventor and entrepreneur Sir James Dyson, has filed proceedings at the High Court against Bosch demanding a return of all the information it is said to have received from the man.

Such industrial espionage would pose a
serious threat to Dyson because the digital motors, which are used in 
the company’s cordless cleaners and powerful hand dryers, give it a 
unique sales advantage.

Dyson said it had discovered an email
trail between its engineer, who worked at the firm’s design 
headquarters at Malmesbury, Wiltshire, and Dr Wolfgang Hirschburger, a 
vice president of engineering at Bosch.

This identified contacts thought to have taken place over two years and payments totalling £11,500.

The mole, who is a graduate of Chinese origin, has been dismissed by Dyson, which has not named him.

It is understood that he worked for Bosch in the past before taking up other posts and then joining Dyson.

Allegation: Dyson said it had discovered an email trail between its engineer, who worked at the firm's design headquarters (pictured) at Malmesbury, Wiltshire, and a senior Bosch executive

A Dyson spokesman said: ‘Bosch has 
unlawfully obtained secret motor technology via an engineer employed in 
Dyson’s advanced digital motor development team.

'Bosch paid the mole via an unincorporated business created specifically for this purpose.

The digital motors at the heart of the row are used in Dyson's cordless cleaners and powerful hand dryers. This picture shows founder and designer James Dyson with the Dyson Airblade

‘As well as Dyson’s technology 
secrets being passed to Bosch, the information was also passed on to 
Bosch’s Chinese motor manufacturer.

'Bosch vice-president Dr Hirschburger was aware of the engineer’s employment at Dyson.’

Dyson has confronted Bosch with 
evidence but – to date – the German company has refused to return any 
technology. Nor has it promised not to use it for its benefit.

Mark Taylor, Dyson’s research and 
development director, said: ‘We have spent over 15 years and £100million
developing high-speed brush- less motors.’

Bosch said in a statement: ‘Bosch notes the allegations made ... by Dyson, which Dyson has asserted as fact.

'Dyson employed an individual with a 
pre-existing consultancy agreement with Bosch Lawn and Garden Limited in
relation to garden products, and not vacuum cleaners or hand dryers as 
Dyson implies.

‘Bosch has sought to establish the 
full details of what occurred, including attempting to establish from 
Dyson what, if any, confidential information supposedly passed between 
Bosch and Dyson.’

Cutting edge: Dyson is behind a number of technological innovations, such as the Air Multiplier desk fan (left) and its high-performance vacuum cleaners (right)

Tech giant: Bosch manufactures a wide range of products, from automotive parts to industrial technology to consumer goods and power tools
