Amir Khan will be the headline act in Las Vegas when he takes on Devon Alexander at the Mandalay Bay Centre on December 13.

Khan rejected the chance to face then world champion Alexander last year in favour of a potential fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr which failed to materialise.

Instead he made his welterweight debut against Luis Collazo the following May, impressing during a unanimous points victory.

Since then, Khan has seen his bitter rival Kell Brook win the same world title Alexander held 12 months ago.

He also missed out on the chance to fight Mayweather in September as he was observing Ramadan and was unable to train properly.

Khan will hope that an impressive showing against Alexander will catapult him to the front of the queue to face Mayweather next May.

Instead of facing Khan, Alexander was outpointed by Shawn Porter in New York before Porter in turn lost his belt to Brook.

Alexander returned to winning ways against Jesus Soto Karass in June. Fellow welterweight Keith Thurman is also expected to be on the card in December.
