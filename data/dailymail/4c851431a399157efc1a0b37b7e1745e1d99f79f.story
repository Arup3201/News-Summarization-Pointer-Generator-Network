Dogs love playing fetch, but it can be monotonous and boring for owners.

But now a robot lets pets enjoy themselves, while their owners put their feet up.

iFetch throws balls a variable distance and is triggered by the dog itself, so owners will no longer have to handle tennis balls wet with dog slobber.

iFetch throws balls a variable distance and is triggered by the dog itself so owners will no longer have to cope with handling tennis balls wet with dog slobber. Here a chihuahua inspects the hole that shoots the small tennis balls

The robot shoots balls out of a small hole when they are posted into a large funnel by the dog.

The compact device, which costs $99 (£60) is 8in (20cm) tall and 9in (23cm) in diameter.

It weighs 2.5lbs (1kg) and gets its powers from the mains or six batteries if the toy is being used outside.

iFetch launches balls that are one-and-a-half inches (4cm) in diameter – or  slightly smaller than a tennis ball, presumably so people have to buy the special iFetch balls -  three of which come with the device.

Owners who are fed up with picking up dog toys might consider training their dogs to tidy up after themselves.

A
 Treat & Train remote treat dispenser allows owners to remotely 
reward their dogs for putting their toys in the smart toy box.

The
 $102 device, which is sold on Amazon, measures 14in (36cm) long and
8in (20cm) tall and trains dogs to behave well by using 
positive reinforcement, linking food to good behaviour.

A
 treat can be dispensed from the device from within 100ft away using a 
remote control, or automatically when the dog puts a treat inside.

Owners can choose how far they want their dog to run as the robot has three distance settings – to launch balls either 10ft, 20ft or 30ft (3m, 6m or 9m) – by pressing a button on the back of the device.

Some customers have told the company that it took just 20 minutes to train their dog to play fetch independently – with the aid of a handful of treats.

‘If your dog already loves to play fetch, it should be pretty easy,’ the firm said.

However, the company warned that too much excitement and excess slobbering can be a problem for the device.

It said: ‘Some dogs slobber more than others. If your dog is a heavy slobberer the iFetch may require wiping off balls from time to time, making it difficult for the dog to play continuously by itself.’

While the robot is great for exercising smaller dogs, the company, which is based in Austin, Texas, said it is developing a larger and more powerful version of the robot for bigger dogs.

The device is available both in the US and the UK.
