Manchester City keeper Karen Bardsley has until 6pm Tuesday to answer a FA charge for violent conduct after an ugly goalmouth altercation with Birmingham City's Freda Ayisi. 

The pair came to blows as they jostled for position before a corner in their sides' 0-0 draw in Women's Super League One on Sunday before video of the incident went viral.

Ayisi was sent off following the 45th-minute incident but after the referee's report confirmed he had not seen Bardsley's involvement in the scuffle and FA charge was brought.

Video footage of the incident shows Ayisi use her elbow on Bardsley's chest, to which the 30-year-old keeper reacts with a swinging arm of her own. 

Ayisi then strikes Bardsley twice more before they were separated. 

American-born Bardsley, who has played 43 times for England's senior women's side, said she had contacted Birmingham City and regretted the altercation. 

'Passions ran high against Birmingham yesterday. Viewing the footage again, I regret the incident with Freda Ayisi,' Bardsley posted on Twitter.

'Whilst I was provoked, it was out of character for me to react in that way. I’ve contacted Birmingham to apologise for my involvement.'
