Criticism: Thomas Docherty, Labour’s shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said: ‘This is a zombie government completely out of ideas'

MPs were last night accused of working ‘part-time’ after it emerged they will only have to spend two full days a week in Parliament until the election.

From this week, they will be allowed to leave Westminster to begin their weekend as early as Wednesday afternoons because of a lack of legislation to pass.

Backbench and opposition MPs have accused the Government of presiding over a ‘zombie Parliament’ with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats unable to agree on major new laws.

Despite the logjam, the Coalition will go on until May because of a law creating fixed-term parliaments of five years.

The Government Chief Whip Michael Gove informed all 303 Tory MPs in a note last month that there will be no major legislation on Thursdays for the foreseeable future.

It means the politicians, who are paid £67,060 a year, are now expected to attend Parliament for just two-and-a-half days from 2.30pm on Mondays to the end of business on Wednesdays. Thursdays will be treated as a one-line whip, meaning attendance is not required.

Departmental questions and backbench debates will continue to be held in the Commons, but few are expected to stay behind.

With no crunch votes to stay for, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs are also likely to return home to campaign for votes ahead of next year’s election.

John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, accused the Coalition of creating ‘part-time MPs’.

He said: ‘The Government is nervous about the election. What they are trying to do is give their MPs time off to fight off the electoral challenge. It is to encourage part-time MPs out electioneering. It shows the Coalition government has run out of steam and cannot agree on anything.’

Thomas Docherty, Labour’s shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said: ‘This is a zombie government completely out of ideas. They are doing the parliamentary equivalent of twiddling their thumbs.’

Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, described it as a ‘farcical situation’. He said: ‘We need a general election, but we cannot have one. So we’re going to have to go through another six months of this charade of Coalition.

‘The Lib Dems are basically trying to ride two horses at the same time – one being part of government and the other being against the government. It makes for a farcical situation and it is no way to govern.’

Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to introduce the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in a deal with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. The commitment – which was enacted in September 2011 – was supposed to guarantee stability following the formation of the Coalition.

Critics say that the five-year term is too long and has led to the impasse, but a backbench attempt to repeal the act was rejected earlier this year.

Sir Edward Leigh, Tory MP for Gainsborough, said the legislation was ‘a hash job’ and ‘never thought through properly’. He told a backbench debate that it was ‘a constitutional aberration’ – and that it ‘could and does result in zombie government’.

The Commons only met on 162 days during the 2013/14 session, compared to most people’s average working year of 224 days.

A Tory spokesman said: ‘As advice to Conservative MPs made clear, if there is a three line whip then MPs will be required to be in Parliament, as has always been the case. And just as has always been the case, if there is not a three line whip, they are free to choose whether to work in their constituencies instead.’
