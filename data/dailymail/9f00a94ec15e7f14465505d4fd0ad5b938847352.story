Campaign: Lawyer Radd Seiger says the number of people in the sea at any one time should be limited

A health and safety lawyer has called for a limit on the number of holidaymakers allowed in the sea at any one time.

Radd Seiger, from Banbury, Oxon, said it’s only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured due to overcrowding at Cornish beaches.

Having been a regular visitor to popular and trendy Polzeath beach for the past 10 years, he claims there has been an 'explosion' in the number of surfers and bodyboarders.

Mr Seiger’s calls come after he and his 15-year-old daughter was hit by a surfboard on the beach in Cornwall earlier this year.

He said he has voiced his fears to the RNLI - and Cornwall Council - and was told by a safety manager that 'the volume of people in the water was a concern to the charity'.

And he claims the manager told him he would not take his own family into the water.

‘When you get someone from that wonderful charity saying something like that then you know it is an issue,’ he said.

Mr Seiger is so fearful that he said he would not be returning to Polzeath until action is taken to limit the number of people in the water.

‘The council need to get people there for the economy so they are encouraging people into the water but no-one is grasping the mettle and saying “if we put too many people in the water something bad is going to happen”.’

He said RNLI should be given powers to enforced designated areas for surfers, swimmers and bodyboarders, as well as limiting the number of people in the water if necessary.

‘It's the council's responsibility - they have got overall responsibility for health and safety,’ he said.

‘Someone is going to get hurt unless something is done.’

Prime Minister David Cameron and his family often holiday at Polzeath, and in July 2012 Princes William and Harry and their friends went there to body-board.

Holidaymakers and local residents hit back at Mr Seiger’s demands.

On Facebook, Frank Bradshaw wrote: ‘People have been using the sea for years! Why it is this nation needs babysitting!

‘If they ain't falling off of the cliffs they're getting into difficulties in the sea. People need to take care of their own actions!’

Debz Coad wrote: ‘The beach is for everyone.

‘Just abide by a few basic safety rules and watch for lifeguards' directions. People, Cornish or not, need to be responsible for their own actions.

‘More folk paying attention to warnings and being self-aware is all that is required.’

Alan Iles added: ‘Perhaps the safest thing to do would be to limit the amount of holidaymakers coming into the county. 

'Safer beaches, safer roads, less alcohol induced antics like those recently making the news, and less strain on emergency and public services.’

Cornwall Council's beach safety officer Rolo Deards said: ‘Polzeath is a very popular beach with holidaymakers and with the ever growing popularity of surfing, along with new water-based activities such as stand-up paddle-boarding, this does put a greater pressure on the zoning flag system on the beach.

‘Bathers and bodyboarders should go between the red and yellow flags and surfers or craft users should go between the black and white flags.’

James Millidge, the RNLI's community incident reduction manager, said: ‘We have no authority to enforce a regulation on the number of people using the water.’
