Prince William has  told how he had just half an hour's sleep the night before his wedding because he was kept awake by nerves and screaming crowds camped out along the Mall.

The Duke of Cambridge also revealed he tore up his original guest list because it included 777 people neither he nor his bride knew.

Speaking about the noisy crowds outside Clarence House on the eve of his wedding to Kate Middleton, he said: 'They were singing and cheering all night long, so the excitement of that, the nervousness of me and everyone singing - I slept for about half an hour.'

In the build-up to the big day, he said: 'There was very much a subdued moment when I was handed a list with 777 names on - not one person I knew or Catherine knew.

'I went to her and said, "Listen, I've got this list, not one person I know - what do I do?" and [the Queen] went, "Get rid of it. Start from your friends and then we'll add those we need in due course. It's your day."'

Prince William also revealed that, while she has a reputation for being a stickler for protocol, in reality the Queen loves it when things go wrong.

In an interview for a documentary to mark his grandmother's Diamond Jubilee, the prince reveals that she and the Duke of Edinburgh 'adore' it when a slip-up livens up yet another dull official engagement.

'One of the things I know that over the years they've loved is when things go wrong - they absolutely adore it because obviously everything always has to be right, but when things go wrong around them they're the first people to laugh. The Queen has seen so many parades or performances, when there's a small slip-up it tickles their humour, ' he said.

The prince was interviewed by presenter Alan Titchmarsh for Elizabeth: Queen, Wife and Mother to be broadcast on ITV1 next Friday.

The Prince said Queen Elizabeth told him to rip up his original wedding guest list and start again

Crowds who fillled The Mall and camped out overnight before the appearance of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, made him nervous

And he revealed that while the Queen adores her dogs and horses, which help her to 'switch' off, the corgis drive everyone else mad with their barking.

Of her famous pets, he says, they are 'barking all the time... I don't know how she copes with it, but her private life with her dogs and her riding and her walking, it's very important to her - she has got to switch off.

'She enjoys it. I would just question the noise!'

William also spoke of the close bond that exists between the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, saying: 'He's been just the most incredible support to her. I don't know how anyone, coming from the background he came from, and the Navy, he was going places, he was hugely promotable.

Happy family: Prince William said everyone's fascinated by the Queen's life

'A very strong personality, to go from that, and then take a side step, or even a back step, and be the support he's been to the Queen has been quite amazing, and it's a real eye-opener for all of us to look at. As he would put it, he's just the Duke of Edinburgh. She is the Queen.

'He very much wants to be there to support her, so that she doesn't get that isolation, that loneliness, but also as a sounding-board. And also, he makes her laugh, because some of the things he says and does, the way he looks at life, is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.'

'They were singing and cheering all night long, so the excitement of that, the nervousness of me and everyone singing - I slept for about half an hour.'

The Duke of Cambridge

William said the prospect of following in the Queen's footsteps was a daunting one: 'There's not much wriggle room left for me to try and find my own path but I will do. It's just a matter of learning what's gone before me. She's an incredible role model. I would like to take all of her experiences, all of her knowledge and put it in a small box and to be able to constantly refer to it.

'Everyone's fascinated by the Queen's life and how she's done it. And I would just hope, and I think she would love, is that a bit of what she's done and a bit of what she's achieved, and a bit of how she's conducted herself, we all take away in our own lives and try and do it ourselves. '

Also interviewed is William's cousin, Princess Eugenie, younger daughter of the Duke of York.

She reveals that she often entertains her grandmother with tales of her escapades at university in Newcastle.

'She lights up whenever I talk about something to do with me because she's so interested in all of us. We talk about my Newcastle life,' she says.

In an interview in the Radio Times she said: 'Of course, the members of the royal family are human and make mistakes, but look at the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince William, the Princess Royal - they have a complete dedication to their job, to enthusing people and making them feel special.

'Talk to people who have just met the Queen, and they are on cloud nine. In effect, the royal family is in the happiness business,' she said.
