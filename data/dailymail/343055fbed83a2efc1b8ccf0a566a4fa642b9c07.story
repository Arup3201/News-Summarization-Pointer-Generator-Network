Cameron lines up top job for Eton friend Ed: Prime Minister promises plum diplomatic role for old school chum.

David Cameron is lining up a plum diplomatic job for the old schoolfriend who works as his £140,000-a-year Chief of Staff.

Ed Llewellyn has been promised a key ambassadorship – with Rome currently top of  the list – after the 2015 Election as a ‘thank you’ for his loyalty, sources say.

Old Etonian Mr Llewellyn  has known Mr Cameron since school and the pair were close colleagues at  Conservative Central Office  in the early 1990s.

But Mr Llewellyn is regarded with suspicion on the Right of the party because of his roots in ‘wet’ politics.

Dominic Cummings, a former adviser to Education Secretary Michael Gove, has accused him of being a closet Lib Dem.

He also accused him of being a ‘third-rate suck-up, kick-down sycophant’.

A No 10 spokesman said: ‘Ed Llewellyn is entirely focused on his job as Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister and ensuring he wins the next General Election.’
