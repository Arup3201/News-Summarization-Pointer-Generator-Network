Shawn Smith got roped into joining his two mates on the overnight duty-free trip to the continent to buy cheap tobacco while drinking down the pub 

A father who went to his local for pre-Christmas drinks with friends woke up 300 miles away in France - and was stuck in Paris for a week because he didn't have a passport.

Shawn Smith got roped into joining his two mates on the overnight duty-free trip to the continent to buy cheap tobacco while drinking down the pub.

Incredibly, the 48-year-old who has never left the UK and doesn't even own a passport, managed to get through unchallenged in Dover, France and Belgium while he snoozed in the back of his friend's car on December 1.

But he was stopped by customs officers on the return leg at Calais and was ordered to go to the British Consulate 180 miles in Paris to apply for an emergency passport.

Mr Smith was forced to stay in the French capital for a week due to complications in the application over his place of birth, Germany, which cost £99.

He also shelled out £450 on food and accommodation, surviving on guest house breakfast croissants and fast-food meals at McDonalds.

The self-employed plasterer eventually arrived back home exhausted in Worcester on December 10 and is now warning people not to leave the UK without their passport.

Father-of-six Shawn said: 'I'd only gone out for a couple of quiet pints with my pals at the local pub.

'They told me they were going to go across to Anderlecht in Belgium to stock on tobacco.

'Apparently you can legally buy 60 packets and that would last me the year for a faction of the cost of the price in Britain.

They asked if I wanted to go along and I thought 'why not'. 

The father-of-six's duty-free route: He leaves Worcester on the overnight duty-free trip to Belgium and incredibly managed to get through Dover, France and Belgium without a passport while he snoozed in the back of his friend's car on December 1 but was stopped on the return leg coming back through Calais and sent to Paris to wait for the emergency travel document

But he was stopped by customs officers on the return leg at Calais and spent the next week in  Paris to apply for an emergency passport, while there he spent over £50 on phone calls to his partner, Judy Ballard, to reassure her he was safe and sent her postcards (pictured)

'We planned to do an over-nighter, as a bit of an adventure. I just remember laughing a lot and my friend who wasn't drinking drove us down to Dover.

'I must have fallen asleep when we got to the port because the next thing I knew I woke up and was in France and we were on the way to Belgium.

'I thought to myself it was strange no one had asked me for my passport because I don't actually have one. I just thought because we were in Europe you don't need one.

'We went to a 24-hour hypermarket and filled up with tobacco and were coming back when I got stopped at Calais.

'I was shocked when they told me I had to go to Paris to fill out the forms for an emergency passport but I had no choice.

'I don't want to see Paris again, although it is a beautiful city.'

Shawn only managed to survive the eight days in France because his brother wired him cash when he drained his own funds.

He also spent over £50 on phone calls to his partner, Judy Ballard, to reassure her he was safe.

Shawn has now praised the British Consulate who managed to find him a cheaper room for just £17 a night.

He added: 'I only went abroad to save cash on tobacco but it ended up costing me a fortune. It was an expensive hangover but something to tell the grandkids about.

'The British Consulate was excellent. They did everything they could.'

Under the 1995 Schengen Agreement passports are not checked at the borders of some EU countries, but this doesn't apply to the UK.

And official EU advice states clearly: 'You must still show a valid passport when travelling to or from the United Kingdom.' 

They planned to stock-up on the cut-price roll-ups which is just a third of the price of British tobacco.
