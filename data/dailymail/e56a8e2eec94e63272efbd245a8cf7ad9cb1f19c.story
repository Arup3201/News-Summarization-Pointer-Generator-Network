A couple believe they may own Britain's naughtiest dog after the puppy ate its way through wallpaper, bricks and even the family's new kitchen floor.

Ralph, the seven-month-old spaniel, has chomped his way through cables and destroyed solar panels at his home in Guisborough, North Yorkshire.

Despite his adorable puppy-dog eyes, owners Dean and Diane Yates say the animal regularly creates havoc in their home.

But they could not resist is cute and cuddly looks and lively character when they first went to choose a family pet.

At just weeks old, Ralph ate of the wallpaper in his room under the staircase, so much so that the area is now bare.

He even managed to escape upstairs and to knock their eight-year-old daughter's tooth out while jumping around on her bed while she was asleep.

The family quickly learnt not to let Ralph in their front room after he tore up their carpet and even ate the solar panels when they tried to keep him in the garden.

They also returned home one evening to find a huge section of the kitchen floor pulled up, with Ralph staring mischievously at them.

Dean, 28, said: 'People warned us that spaniels were energetic dogs but I didn't expect Ralph to be this naughty, I don't know any other dog around that is like him.

'We've never had a family dog before so this has certainly been an experience. Our daughter Abigail picked him because she thought he looked the most fun as he was running over his brothers and sisters - we should have seen the warnings.

'The worst incident for us has to be when we accidentally left his gate open and when we went upstairs he was bouncing on Abigail's bed while she was asleep and had knocked out one of her front teeth.

'It's so hard to be annoyed at him because he is so cute but at first we were really scared because Abigail had blood on her face.

'I was also pretty miffed when he chewed through all the wires to the filter of my brand new aquarium, it cost a bomb and he just tore straight through it.

'We came home one day and found the kitchen floor completely torn up. He was just standing looking at us like a silent menace. I couldn't work out how he had done it as it was twice his size.'

As well as the kitchen floor, Mr Yates, a marine engineer, and his 28-year-old sales assistant wife have caught Ralph eating through bags of their toilet roll when they found it scattered around the house and garden.

The pair have also caught him stealing their prepared meals from the kitchen bench.

The family have had the chocolate brown sprocker - a cross between a cocker and springer spaniel - since he was ten weeks old and say that he shows no sign of calming down with age.

Mr Yates said: 'He would be the perfect puppy, if he could just stop eating everything in sight.

'We have a baby due in April so the next room we were going to decorate was supposed to be the nursery - but now it's going to have to be the kitchen because he has wrecked it.

'He's full of beans despite being walked once on a morning and twice on a night, we're definitely planning on taking him to puppy classes, I really thought I'd be able to train him myself.

'He's so lovely though, he wouldn't hurt a fly and loves affection.'
