The Ice Bucket Challenge might be a thing of the past, but Arsenal players Jack Wilshere and Calum Chambers are already on to the next cause.

The former Southampton defender posted a video of himself doing the Uppies For Autism challenge before nominating Danny Welbeck, Wojciech Szczesny, Nathaniel Clyne and Harrison Reed. 

The challenge, which involves players doing kick-ups, is in aid of the charity The Autism Trust.

After Mathieu Debuchy's injury, Chambers is likely to find himself playing an important role for the Gunners during the first half of the season.

The 19-year-old defender was signed as an understudy to the French full-back but after Debuchy damaged his ankle ligaments against Manchester City he was ruled out until December.

The Gunners have enjoyed a mixed start to the season dotted with some unconvincing defensive displays. 

Next up for Arsene Wenger's side is a home tie against Galatasaray as they look to pick up their first Champions League points of the season.
