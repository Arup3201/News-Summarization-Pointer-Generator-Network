When it comes down to football brass tacks, Vincent Kompany is conclusive, unambiguous and to the point.

Off the pitch as much as on it, the towering Manchester City and Belgium captain's calculated demeanor demands respect.

And the 6ft 4in defender's mind is made up when it comes to his future, too. In the wake of the release of Luis Figo's FIFA presidential campaign manifesto, the 28-year-old appeared informed in his response regarding the prospect of a future role at the international association football federation.

Vincent Kompany gave a frank interview outlining his thoughts on the FIFA presidential election

Talking with The Times and De Volkskrant, Kompany opened up about the idea of working his way onto the ladder of football's governing body. 

'I don't want to enter that world of old crocodiles. If you see all the things that are going wrong at FIFA it really makes me wonder.

'We're talking about the largest sports association in the world and yet nobody buries its head deeper in the sand than FIFA. There is simply no transparency. I don't know why the football world continues to accept it.'

'Whenever there's a vote or there's a decision it's not transparent. It's a very powerful, wealthy organisation but from my point of view so much of it seems to be about protecting this very old bureaucracy that keeps it within its own little world.'

Damning as they may be, Kompany's assertions were followed by a hint of apprehension for former Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan star Figo, who will be challenging Sepp Blatter for his seat at the head of the FIFA boardroom table.

The Belgium skipper said he would not choose to get involved with the 'world of old crocodiles' at FIFA

'My only concern is how much legs this [Figo's candidacy] has. It's one thing to present yourself, but my concern is about the system. How do you actually get the votes?

'I have my doubts about how an outsider can change [FIFA]. You know the people who vote? Change is threatening to them. They can pretend as much as they want that they're going to implement change because that's what people outside FIFA want to hear. But real change? I'm not convinced the people who vote want that.

Former footballer Luis Figo launched his FIFA presidential manifesto at Wembley Stadium earlier this week

Despite his doubts about the FIFA hierarchy, Kompany was on board with the concept of a World Cup in Qatar.  

'It's the world game so it's right the World Cup should be held around the world. If it's summer or winter that's less important. I just want to see FIFA show things happened in the correct manner.' 

Asked his opinion on footballers' wages, the Belgian raised a valid point for debate:

'Of course it's absurd but it's a nuanced discussion. Manchester City's matches are seen worldwide by millions of people. Football is an enormous economy. Millions of kids are inspired by people like [Cristiano] Ronaldo or [Sergio] Aguero. Millions of people make money because Ronaldo is Ronaldo. 

'Also, one thing I've noticed is what a giving culture there is among footballers. If you look around footballers they are very giving to friends, to family, to charities even though they only have a short career. 

Manchester City could be without James Milner (centre) for their Champions League clash with Barcelona 

'If you compare that with someone who works in the City of London, earning a similar amount for a longer period of their life, are all of them so giving?'

At the business end of things, City face a tough week of fixtures heading towards March with a Champions League last 16 first leg showdown with Barcelona separating Premier League clashes with Newcastle and Liverpool.

The Sky Blues sit seven points adrift of league leaders Chelsea before hosting John Carver's men on Saturday and their skipper knows his side's work is cut out for them.

'I would love to be able to win the league by ten or 15 points, just for the sake of having a smooth end of the season, but we always have to do it the hard way - every single time.' 

'It's going to have to be the same again, but that's what shows we're still a club that needs to make so much more progress.'
