Thief: Jennifer Bailey cleared her frail mother's account so she could fund shopping sprees and pay for luxury holidays

A woman stole more than £60,000 from her dying mother so she could fund shopping sprees and pay for luxury holidays.

Jennifer Bailey, 59, from Hull, Yorkshire, abused her position of trust as a carer for Mabel Shaw and spent £63,000 set aside for her care at a residential home.

Bailey used the money to support a lavish lifestyle and even cleared her elderly mother’s account of her last £22,000 on the day she died- leaving nothing pay for her funeral.

Bailey and her brother Nigel Shaw were given power of attorney over Mrs Shaw's estate.

The pair agreed Bailey would take care of the day-to-day finances when her mother was put into Keldgate Manor residential home in Hull, Yorks.

The care home, who were looking after the dementia sufferer, telephoned Mr Shaw to warn him that a payment had not been received and he became suspicious.

Mr Shaw found out money in his mother’s account, most of which had come from the sale of her house, had been spent by his sister.

A fraud investigation was launched in 2009 and despite Mrs’s Shaw's death in 2010, it was completed earlier this year and found Bailey had spent her mother’s money over three years.

Detective Constable Krista Wood, who investigated the case, said: 'Jennifer’s last transaction was January 11, 2010, the day her mother passed away, and she withdrew £22,000, leaving nothing in her mother’s bank account to even cover her funeral.'

'Production orders for several of Mrs Shaw’s bank accounts and conveyancing files from the sale of her house took months to come through.

'Eventually, when all the files were ready, I went through all of the accounts with a fine-toothed comb and followed the money through various accounts in bits and bobs to see where it had gone.

Thief: Jennifer Bailey will be sentenced at Hull Crown Court next week

'It transpired that the money had been spent over a period of several years by Jennifer, who was using it to fund her own lifestyle, shopping, days out, spending money for foreign holidays, and so on. This continued until the money was gone.

When Bailey was interviewed by the police, she refused to co-operate and the case eventually went to court.

DC Wood said: 'Mr Shaw is overjoyed at this outcome, as all he ever wanted was to get to the truth.

'He is also out of pocket, having been defrauded out of his potential inheritance from his mother’s estate, but this was not the primary driver in him making this report to the police.

'He had trusted Jennifer to take care of paying the nursing home for the care of their mother and she let his mother down.'

Bailey admitted the offences at Hull Crown Court and will be sentenced on Friday, November 29.
