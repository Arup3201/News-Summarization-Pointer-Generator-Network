A camera lost nearly six years ago in the churning waves of Maui has resurfaced more than 5,200 miles away in Taiwan with mysterious photos of its believed owner discovered fully intact inside.

The only thing left to find now is the mystery owner whose colorful photos of blue lagoons, mountains, flowers and fish, were up until now, most likely never seen before.

Bruce Chen, General Manager of the China Airlines Honolulu Branch, has set out to do just that and potentially provide a complimentary flight for the owner out to Taiwan.

Memories: An underwater camera believed to have drifted away from its owner in August of 2007 during a snorkeling trip in Hawaii has reappeared with all of it photos seen intact, in Taiwan

Tiny traveler: The small Canon camera is seen still with a few barnacles on its casing after recently found on a beach along Taiwan's east coast

He says it was an employee of his walking on a beach in Taiwan recently who found 'something strange' resting in the sand.

There, beneath a light covering of crusty barnacles and sand, was a beat up Canon camera with its memory card surprisingly neatly preserved inside.

'We checked the memory card and found lots of pictures,' Mr Chen told Hawaii News Now.

He believes they are the personal photographs taken during a diving trip in Kannapali in August of 2007 where the camera's believed to have first drifted away.

Details: After reviewing the photos, that were remarkably perfectly preserved inside, they're believed to have come from a diving trip in Kannapali

Mystery owner: Bruce Chen, General Manager of the China Airlines Honolulu Branch whose employee found the camera, believes its owner is the blonde woman seen on the right

Somehow, more than five and a half years
 later, it traveled directly west through the North Pacific Ocean until 
hitting Taiwan's east coast.

'I don't know how this camera goes to Taiwan but I believe it's God's arrangement,' Mr Chen said.

So moved by the discovery Mr Chen is on a passionate mission to find its rightful owners and return their lost memories.

The problem is, he says: 'I am not sure if this lady is living in Hawaii or Mainland U.S. I don't know.'

Travels: The camera's path it seen after heading more than 5,200 miles west of Maui in the North Pacific Ocean in 2007

Free trip: Whomever the owner is, China Airlines is offering him or her a free ticket to come collect the camera in Taiwan

He's narrowed it down to a single young blond woman seen in the photos as the possible owner.

If he can find her, or whomever is the rightful owner, China Airlines is offering a free ticket for them to come and collect the camera in Taiwan.

He hopes stories like this one will help get the message out.
