A Brazilian Michael Jackson superfan used acid to lighten his skin and spent about £2,000 on a series of cosmetic procedures to look like his hero.

Antonio Gleidson Rodrigues, 32, the self-proclaimed number one Michael Jackson impersonator in Brazil, has had rhinoplasty in order to imitate the King Of Pop and spends around four hours each day rehearsing his dance moves.

Gleidson Jackson, as he likes to be known, had his first operation five years ago when he had his nasal septum corrected to allow him to reach higher notes when singing.

He said: 'I wasn't able to reach notes like Michael before but after surgery I can now sing some notes in falsetto.'

Following his first bid at surgery, Gliedson, of Fortalenza, continued in his mission to imitate the world famous pop star by having hyaluronic acid injected into his face, which had a whitening effect, and botox injections to enhance the area under his eyes.

The former drama teacher also had surgery to close the gaps in his teeth and his eyebrows tattooed.

Gliedson is now hoping to raise enough money by imitating Jackson to have even more surgery. 

He said: 'If I can afford it in the future, I am thinking of working on my cheekbones so I can get rid of the wrinkles along my mouth - I also want to have my eyebrows arched.

'I would like to have my forehead tattooed and have my nose made even slimmer.'

He was encouraged to become a Michael Jackson impersonator when he was just 19 after his drama students suggested he looked like the pop star.

He said: 'It was tough, they teased me for around 15 days and the mothers of the children even got involved.

'By the end of it I was caught up - I had the bug.'

Gleidson now says his act and the dedication he has put into improving it is the greatest tribute he can pay to his idol.

He said: 'In my concerts I always say that no copy will ever be as good as the original.

'But I can always say that I will always try my best to achieve perfection - just like Michael.'

His aunt Maria Doriane Bastos de Souza, however, worries about the  impersonator.

She said: 'He is obsessed, sometimes he will spend hours on the internet looking for things related to Michael Jackson.

'I worry for his health - I want him to come downstairs and eat a sandwich.

'I also worry when he goes into surgery, I never want him to feel disappointed and sometimes surgery doesn't work out the way you would want it to.'

Jackson's death in June 2009 rocked the world but there were few who felt it quite as much as Gleidson.

He said: 'My reaction was absurd - I started to cry right away, I still don't understand how this could have happened to Michael Jackson.

'He was a guy who used to drink juice and avoid energy drinks - how could he have died of an overdose.

'In my opinion, to lose that man - the greatest artist of all times - is a real tragedy for the world.

'There will never be another one like him - but I can try my best.'
