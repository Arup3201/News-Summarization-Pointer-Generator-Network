Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman says the Government is doing 'very little' about increasing numbers of children being exposed to online porn

Ministers were accused of betraying parents last night after they ruled out an automatic block on internet porn to  protect children.

The Department for Education said ‘expert advice’ was against an automatic block, which would force those wanting access to online porn sites to contact their Internet Service Provider (ISP) to ‘opt in’.

Instead, as the Daily Mail revealed last month, ISPs will simply be asked to ‘actively encourage’ parents to switch on internet filters if children are likely to be using computers in the home.

Confirmation of the decision, slipped out on the DfE website without fanfare, came despite evidence from the Government’s consultation that half of parents back an automatic block on internet porn.

Some 35 per cent of parents responding to the consultation backed the ‘opt-in’ system, with a further 15 per cent wanting it imposed with additional controls.

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said the Government’s proposals did not go far enough.

Alan Wardle, of the NSPCC, said: ‘The best option to protect children is for adult content to be automatically blocked by Internet Service Providers.

‘Given that half of the parents who took part in the Government consultation wanted this option, we are concerned their views have not been heard.’  Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman who was campaigning for an automatic block, said: ‘The Government’s response to the consultation is weak. 

Shocking: Helen Porter, from Newbury, Berkshire, told delegates that she knew of a Year 9 pupil who had been 'persuaded' to take part in an amateur porn video

‘They have set no deadline for change and still appear to be putting the interests of internet companies before the safety of children.’

The Daily Mail revealed last month that David Cameron preferred an industry-led solution to the problem of online porn, with ISPs told to help parents impose internet filters if they want them.

In its response yesterday, the DfE said parents have ‘just as much responsibility for keeping their children safe when they are online as when they are offline’.

The Government’s consultation was flooded with hundreds of responses from the Open Rights Group which campaigns against internet restrictions. The internet industry also mounted a concerted campaign against automatic restrictions on the lucrative online porn sector.
