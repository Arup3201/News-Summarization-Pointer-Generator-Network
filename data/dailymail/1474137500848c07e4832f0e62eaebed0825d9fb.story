Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney is used to Champions League football in midweek but with Louis van Gaal's side outside of Europe this season the England star enjoyed some time off with his sons.

Rooney posted a picture on his Instagram page next to one of his sons with the caption: 'Good to have my little mates back from holiday. Trip to the cinema to see Peppa Pig!'

The 29-year-old was relaxing away from Manchester United's disjointed Premier League campaign before they face Sunderland on Saturday.

Van Gaal's side are currently fourth in the Premier League, despite inconsistent form, having suffered a damaging 2-1 defeat at Swansea last weekend.

Rooney has been deployed in central midfield regularly by van Gaal in recent months but has returned to the United attack. 

The England captain will hope to add to his nine goal tally this season for the Old Trafford side, having ended a nine game goal drought against Preston in the FA Cup earlier this month.

Manchester United players can't hide their frustration having conceded twice at Swansea on Saturday
