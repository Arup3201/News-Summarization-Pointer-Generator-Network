Troubled NRL star Darius Boyd has taken a trip to the Greek islands to recuperate, just weeks after he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment of his depression.

The 27-year-old Newcastle Knights star has been holidaying in Santorini and Mykonos with his wife, designer Kayla Heathcote, who has shared photographs of the winger looking relaxed by the water.

The Maroons player has been given leave from the Newcastle Knights as he seeks treatment, following an incident at a resort in NSW's Hunter Valley, in which he allegedly caused $1,500 to his hotel room.

Ms Heathcote has been sharing photographs of the couple's holiday on Instagram and on Tuesday fellow Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon, who broke his neck in a tackle earlier this year, commented on Boyd's absence in her photographs, writing: 'Did you kill darbs already? Where is he?'

Ms Heathcote responded with a gorgeous picture of the couple relaxing by the Santoirini coast at sunset with the caption: 'Here is one just for you @alexmmckinnon he's still alive and he's in pretty good shape as you can see. We miss you guys and lots of love to you both.'

Another photograph, showing a shirtless Boyd with a towel around his neck, was captioned: 'Boyd â€“ bulking, buff & bronzed' by his admiring wife.

The couple's holiday comes after Mr Boyd checked himself in for treatment following an incident at a Hunter Valley resort

Boyd checked himself into a psychiatric hospital on July 23 and spent three weeks there being treated for depression, which he has suffered from for years.

Boyd has taken leave from the Knights, and the NRL club said there was no timeframe on Boyd's return to football, with their focus purely on the 27-year-old's health.

'We are ensuring Darius gets the best possible care and treatment at this time,' the NRL club's CEO Matt Gidley said in a statement on Wednesday.

'Depression is a serious illness in our society and we are pleased Darius has taken the first step in his recovery by acknowledging he needs help,' Gidley said.

'Football is secondary at this point, it is important Darius' focus is entirely on his treatment.'

The Newcastle Knights star admitted himself into a Sydney facility on July 23 after problems with his mental health continued to escalate

His admission came less than a week after reports that he'd trashed a hotel room in the Hunter Valley, causing $1,500 worth of damage

The resort's general manager Joe Spagnolo said the incident had not been reported to authorities because Boyd rang to apologise and offered to pay for the damage
