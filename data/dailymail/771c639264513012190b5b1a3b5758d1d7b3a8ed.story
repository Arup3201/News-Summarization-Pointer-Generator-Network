It's a well-known rule that paintings should be looked at, not touched - but this innovative piece of artwork is breaking all the usual rules.

This eye-catching creation depicting some of London's most iconic landmarks invites passers-by to jump, flip or even dive-bomb into the artwork to re-live a bit of the Olympic spirit.

The trompe l'oeil, which was created to commemorate the second anniversary of the London 
2012 Games, allows would-be swimmers to 'stand' on the board and 'peer' into the water, in the manner of British diver Tom Daley.

The 22-year-old also performs a hand stand, right, on the piece of work, which has been created in East Village, Stratford

It stands in the former 
athletes' quarters at East Village, Stratford and includes sights such as the Queen Elizabeth II Olympic Park, Canary Wharf and the biggest stars of the Games, including Bradley Wiggins, Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis.

The creation comes from Joe Hill, founder of 3D Joe and Max, an artistic duo which has become internationally-renowned for its vibrant 3D street art.

Mr Hill, from Holloway, north London, said: 'The picture isn't finished until there's a person in it.'

Mr Hill and Max Lowry 
began travelling all over the world around nine years ago, creating realistic scenes 
to brighten up pavements for pedestrians.

Their work - which is often created for live events, marketing campaigns, music videos and TV commercials - has included fantastical scenes such as raging waterfalls, fiery depths and plunging canyons.

Since Mr Lowry died in 2010, Mr Hill decided to continue the pair's work, keeping the name 3D Joe and Max in his partner's memory.

His recent work includes extending The Solaris Building
 in Singapore by four levels and creating a futuristic city for Motorola 
in London and Barcelona.

The artwork, shown here in its infancy, will be on display for the next week and is said to capture the 'changing skyline and vibrancy of the area' 

In November 2011, 3D Joe and Max broke the Guinness World Record for the World’s Largest and the World’s Longest Anamorphic Artwork at West India Quay, London for Reebok Europe.

In 2012, the duo won an award in the Global Marketing category at the Marketing Society Awards for Excellence for Visit Britain’s GREAT campaign, a world tour of ten cities promoting tourism to the UK in the lead-up to the Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics in 2012.

Tony O'Reilly, the East Village 
operations director, said the work, which will be on display for the next 
week, captured the changing skyline and vibrancy of the area.

Members of the public can interact with 
the artwork on Twitter using the hashtag #DiveIntoE20 over the next 
week.
