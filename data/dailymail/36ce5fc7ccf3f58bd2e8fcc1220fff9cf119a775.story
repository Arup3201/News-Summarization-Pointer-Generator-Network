A key adviser to Lord Justice Leveson last night threw plans for regulating the media into turmoil by denouncing the idea of a Royal Charter to oversee a new regulator for Britain’s Press.

Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said it was ‘constitutionally inappropriate, undemocratic, opaque and in no way fit for this purpose’.

She rejected two rival versions of a Royal Charter, one drawn up in late night talks between the three main political parties and the Hacked Off pressure group, and another by the industry.

Unimpressed: Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said the idea of a Royal Charter to oversee a new regulator for Britain's Press was 'constitutionally inappropriate, undemocratic and opaque'

Miss Chakrabarti, one of six ‘assessors’ who guided the Leveson Inquiry, suggested the Press could set up its own self-regulatory body, with the power to issue fines of up to £1million and direct prominent apologies, without waiting for the Privy Council to decide on the way forward.

She proposed that Parliament should pass legislation to set the criteria for a new regulator and the courts be given the job of deciding if those criteria are met.

But a senior industry figure said last night: ‘The problem with this proposal is that it means politicians will be writing the rules, and the judiciary will be charged with seeing that they are obeyed.

‘Neither is compatible with a free Press – and the judiciary are likely to have grave reservations about becoming involved in such a contentious issue as oversight of a Press regulator.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
