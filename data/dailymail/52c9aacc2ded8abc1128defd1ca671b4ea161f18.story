An iconic red dress worn by screen siren Marilyn Monroe at the height of her career has emerged for sale with a £360,000 price tag.

The Hollywood legend wore the red saloon gown when she performed a song as bar singer Kay Weston in the 1954 film River of No Return.

She sang One Silver Dollar to drinkers in the bar in one of the opening scenes of the film, set in the Gold Rush era.

The dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in this movie poster for River Of No Return is now up for sale at auction 

American actress Debbie Reynolds, 82, a contemporary of Marilyn's, bought the dress at a sell-off of costumes by film studio 20th Century Fox in 1971.

She sold it in 2000 to a private collector and it has been in their hands ever since.

Experts have tipped it to fetch $600,000 - around £360,000 - when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams auction. 

In contrast, figures released last week showed that in June, the average UK home was worth £265,000.

This isn't the first dress of Marilyn's owned by Debbie to be given such a large price tag - other iconic outfits sold  for even more.

In 2011, the white dress that she wore in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch sold for £2.8m, while a red sequinned dress and headdress that she wore in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes changed hands at the same auction for £900,000.

A green velour dress also worn by Marilyn in The River Of No Return, which she wore to sing 'I'm Gonna File My Claim,' sold for £304,000.

Actress Debbie Reynolds (pictured) was a prolific collector of Hollywood costumes, but has been forced to sell most of the items recently

Debbie said at the time of the 2011 auction: 'I'm heartbroken. I don't want to see the collection broken up - it should stay intact. 

'It's a real shame but that's the way it's going to be.' 

She was reported to be seen sobbing as she watched the lots go up for sale.
