A spokesman for the resort said: ‘Baha Mar's vision will truly come to life once the first guests sleep in our hotels, dine at our restaurants, snorkel at our reef, lounge at our Cabana Club, play at our casino, dance in our clubs until dawn, and experience the true soul of The Bahamas with impeccable service.’

Rooms in the hotels feature 48-inch flat screen televisions, Nespresso coffee machines make and full or step-out balconies.

The government hopes that Baha Mar will turn the Bahamas into a world-class gaming destination.

Explaining the delay in opening, Robert Sands, a senior vice president for Baha Mar Ltd said the project has been ‘quite complex’ and Baha Mar wants to be sure it can ‘offer the complete luxury product’ when it opens.

Mr Sands added: ‘Our state-of-the-art casino will match what you would find in Las Vegas, Macao or Singapore.’
