Men born abroad have been more likely to hold down a job since the financial crisis than those born in Britain, an international think-tank has found.

Despite a drop in overall employment during the economic downturn, male migrants in the UK have had higher levels of employment than ‘native-born men’.

Before 2007, foreign men were less likely to be in a job than those born in this country.

The OECD's International Migration Outlook 2013 has shown how foreign-born men have had higher levels of employment than British-born workers since 2007

But analysis by the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents the world’s 
leading industrialised nations, has found that since then foreign-born 
workers have been better at keeping their jobs.

Critics of immigration policies say the report shows Britons have not benefited from economic growth over previous years.

But others say migrants are, in many cases, simply more hard-working.

The OECD study found that in 2006, 
before the economic crisis, 76.9 per cent of British-born men were in a 
job – ahead of 76.3 per cent of those born abroad.

But by 2008, the figures had flipped,
 with a 76.8 per cent employment rate for British-born men compared with
 77.8 per cent for those born abroad.

The report suggests 'foreign-born' men have reversed a pre-crisis shortfall and are now doing better than men who were born in the country. File picture shows migrants workers in a field at a farm in Lincolnshire

The 2012 figures show the gap is now 
even wider with 74.3 per cent employment for men born in the UK compared
 with 76.9 per cent for foreign-born men.

For women, however, those born in the UK are still more likely to be in employment than those born elsewhere.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of 
MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘It is time for the thorough assessment of the 
impact of immigration on the employment of British workers that this 
report only touches on.’

The unemployment rate now stands at 7.8 per cent, according to the latest figures from the ONS

The findings feature in the 
Paris-based think-tank’s International Migration Outlook report for 
2013, which also reveals that in 2011 total permanent immigration rose 
in 34 OECD countries, from 2010.

The report also found the UK and 
Germany are the biggest recipients of migrants from areas most affected 
by the financial crisis, particularly southern Europe, with numbers 
almost doubling in recent years.

It concluded the take-up of benefits 
by immigrants relative to native-born households in the UK is lower than
 the average in OECD countries.

Don Flynn, director of Migrants’ 
Rights Network, said: ‘With a high level of male migrant participation 
rates in economic activity and an upward trend in earning levels the 
evidence shows migration is a dynamic and positive feature of modern 
economies and ought to be acknowledged as such.’

The latest figures from the Office 
for National Statistics show the total number of people unemployed 
between February and April 2013 was 2.51 million.

The OECD report suggests while the 
employment rates of British-born men has fallen from 78.14 per cent in 
2001 to 74.73 per cent in 2012, male migrant workers have seen an 
increase from 72.3 per cent to 76.9 per cent.

A Home Office spokesman said half of those UK residents who were foreign-born, as defined in the report, were now British citizens.

She said: 'The official figures show that the recent rise in employment has benefited British citizens first but that we continue attracting skilled migrants to the UK where they are needed by British businesses.

'We are building an immigration system that works in the national interest and is supporting growth.

'Our reforms are working, and they are having an impact in all the right places. We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife and net migration is down by almost a third as a result.

'We will continue to work hard to ensure that net migration is reduced from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament.'

The report also found that the UK and Germany are the biggest recipients of migrants fleeing countries most affected by the financial crisis, particular in southern Europe, with numbers almost doubling in recent years.

It added that outflows of nationals from these countries are speeding up, with movements having risen by 45 per cent from 2009 to 2011 and early data suggests this increase is continuing.

Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: 'The OECD data on labour markets make very interesting reading.

'It is important to recognise that migrants are not one homogenous group, and that different sorts of migrants have been affected differently by the economic downturn.

'Two things stand out, the first is that there is a big gender difference - foreign-born men have seen less of a decline in their employment rate than UK born men between 2008 and 2012, but the employment rate of foreign-born women has seen a bigger decline than that of UK-born women in the same period.'

Looking at Romania and Bulgaria, which will see access restrictions to the UK labour market lifted at the end of this year, the report draws a number of conclusions.

In Romania, the OECD said migration data is limited with officially registered emigration likely to capture only a small fraction of outflows.

This is significant because there has
 been a prolonged debate in the UK over providing estimates of the 
numbers of Romanians likely to arrive in the UK next year.

'It is time for a thorough assessment of
 the impact of immigration on the employment of British workers that 
this report only touches on'

The UK Government has so far refused to provide official estimates as ministers believe they would not be reliable.

Earlier this week the Daily Mail reported how Britain was the first choice for young Romanians who want to work abroad.

Research revealed a quarter of the population aged between 18 and 35 would choose a job in the UK when work restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians are removed on January 1.

The study found that Britain had overtaken Germany as the most popular destination for young Romanians wanting to emigrate.

In Bulgaria, the OECD pointed to a National Public Opinion Institute study which found that 12 per cent of Bulgarians surveyed planned to emigrate one restrictions on free movement to the EU were lifted. This is the equivalent of 876,000 of the population.

Looking at the education sector, the report also found that the UK is one of six countries where international students are over-represented among the universities and other higher education institutions when compared to the number of foreign-born persons in the population.

But the report concluded that the take-up of social benefits by immigrants relative to native-born households in the UK is lower than the average seen in all OECD countries, across all types of benefits.
