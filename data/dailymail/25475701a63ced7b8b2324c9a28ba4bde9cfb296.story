Keeping your devices safe and secure is a growing problem - from the Heartbleed bug to the NSA, digital security is at the top of the agenda.

But now experts believe the solution may lie in quantum computing, which would encrypt our phones and, they claim, make them almost unhackable.

Led by Dr. Anthony Laing at the University of Bristol, a team has been working on quantum encoders.

Under lock and key: Researchers have developed a quantum encoding machine that could make your phone unhackable, although you'll need to use a 'quantum phone booth'

They have been trying to shrink the encoders into more usable sizes.

And their latest breakthrough might make quantum encoding a modern security feature.

At the moment our internet transactions are secured by public key cryptography.

This is an algorithm that requires two keys - one private and one public.

While effective, it is susceptible to ‘eavesdropping’ hackers who can then duplicate the keys and get access to secure content.

A quantum key, however, cannot be duplicated in the same way, and any attempt to do so destroys the original.

Theoretically, this would make codes unbreakable.

But while this security measure is desirable, it requires large and bulky equipment to be possible.

This equipment is in the form of a server that is used to encode a phone.

Dr. Laing and his team have found a way to reduce the size of this server to that of a case of beer.

This then sends photons through a fibre-optical capable into a device that is then embedded in your mobile phone.

Modern day computers run on a model designed by Alan Turing in the 1930s.

They are digital and use 'bits' to transfer information and perform tasks.

They use binary code and can only ever been in an active, or an inactive state - running at one or zero.

This means that a single bit is either on or off at any one time.

The D-Wave quantum computer

Qubits work differently and can be on, off, or in a mixed state in between.

As a result, qubits are able to be in
multiple places at the same time.

Whereas the original Turing computer can only make one calculation at a time, quantum computers are capable of 
performing single tasks faster, and performing multiple tasks more 
effectively.

Tasks that would take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds using quantum computers like the D-Wave.

‘Large resources such as laser and detectors are situated at the server side, which is accessible via telecom fiber to a client requiring only an on-chip polarization rotator, which may be integrated into a handheld device,’ the researchers write in their paper.

‘This opens the way for quantum enhanced secure communications between companies and members of the general public equipped with handheld mobile devices, via telecom-fiber tethering.’

Inside the device in your phone, photons are altered as they pass through, encrypting any message that is sent.

To send texts or make calls securely, you would just need to plug your mobile into the server.

It has been likened to an ATM machine, which you’d use with your phone to make, for example, secure financial transactions.

Known as quantum cryptography, this feature is being researched further by Nokia and they hope that the technology could soon be making its way to a phone near you.

The new research could enable our phones to being undergo quantum encoding in future so that we can send secure texts and also make safe financial transactions, according to the researchers
