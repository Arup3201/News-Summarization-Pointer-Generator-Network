A man in his 50s was killed last night after being hit by an ambulance.

The pedestrian was run over on the A1 southbound road near Haggerston in Northumberland.

The ambulance was transferring a patient between Berwick and Wansbeck hospitals. It was a non-emergency and the vehicle was not travelling with sirens or blue lights.

The crew were being supported by a senior ambulance officer and were described as being 'extremely shocked'.

A further two ambulances were sent to the scene of the incident, which took place just before 7pm, and the original patient was transferred to Wansbeck Hospital.

Officers and paramedics attended the scene and diversions were put in place while a section of the A1, between the B6353 and B6525, was closed in both directions.

There have been no arrests in relation to the fatal collision.

A North East Ambulance NHS Foundation
Trust spokesman said: 'We would like to offer our most sincere 
condolences to the family and friends of the pedestrian at this 
difficult time.

'The ambulance crew involved in the 
incident are being supported by a senior ambulance service officer, as 
they are extremely shocked by what has happened.'

The ambulance service said it was working closely with the police to 'find out what happened and support their investigation in any way we can'.

The spokesman added: 'The ambulance involved was carrying out a routine patient transfer â€“ and so was not travelling with blue lights or sirens as these were not needed for the patient on-board.

'There were no injuries to the ambulance patient or crew, but we would urge any witnesses to the collision to contact the police to help with their investigation.'

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Anyone who was driving in the area at the time of the incident and who witnessed anything is asked to contact police on 101 ext 69191.'
