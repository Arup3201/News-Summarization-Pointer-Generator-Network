Embarrassing body odour could become a thing of the past thanks to a new range of summer clothing for men from Marks and Spencer.

The High Street store are incorporating Odegon DeoTags into the under arms of their latest suits and blazers.

The innovative patches are made from nano-porous material that is designed to  absorb body odour molecules and then neutralise them to avoid unpleasant smells.

Keeping cool: The M&S Man Superlite Suit, £179, uses Odegon DeoTags under the arms to prevent body odour

But while fashion with the material is only just hitting the shops, it has had a lifesaving use for decades.

During the Second World War when chemical attacks were feared, the material was patented by the Ministry of Defence for use in gas masks.

Embarrassing problem solved: Excess sweating is not a good look - or smell

Lifesaving: The same material is used in gas masks because it can absorb and neutralise harmful gases

The material can absorb and neutralise harmful gases so has been used in the production of chemical,
biological, radiological and nuclear suits and gas masks since 1942.

The patches may not be put to lifesaving use by M&S but it could spare many a modern man's blushes by its ability to prevent smelly sweat patches.

The technology is used in the M&S Man Superlite Suit, £179, and M&S Man Performance blazer, £99, that go on sale this month as part of the store's summer range for men.

Odegon Technologies, who make the  DeoTags used in the M&S clothes, say each patch 'has the surface area equivalent of a tennis court and last for the length of the garment, even after washing'.

They add: 'Polarised molecules from body odour are absorbed and permanently trapped within the material’s structures until the garment is cleaned, either by hand or machine washing or by dry cleaning, and the molecules are flushed out.'

The company also make patches for shoes called 'DeoSole' that eliminate foot odours in the same way.
