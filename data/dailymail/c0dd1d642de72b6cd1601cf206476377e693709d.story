A grandmother was killed yesterday when her home was crushed by a landslip.

Susan Norman’s ground floor flat was flattened as the three-storey building collapsed just before 6am after violent downpours hit Looe, Cornwall.

Mrs Norman, 68, who lived alone, had complained to authorities that she feared her home might collapse following a nearby landslip in December.

Collapse: A house in Looe, Cornwall has partially fallen after a night of heavy rain

Search: A rescue team and sniffer dog have attended the scene looking for a missing resident

Her children, Helen, Matthew and Rachael, had not heard from her since she went to bed at 7pm on Thursday after a long journey.

They had clung to the faint hope she 
was alive until authorities told them last night they had found Mrs 
Norman’s body in the rubble. Her daughter Rachael Boden said that the 
family was ‘extremely numb’.

More than a dozen local residents were forced to evacuate the street over fears more properties were at risk of damage.

But Ms Norman, who is in her 60s, could not be found, so a search team with a sniffer dog arrived at the site to investigate the possibility she might be trapped within the rubble of the house.

Scenic: But the beautiful landscape in Cornwall was the scene of tragedy today

Neighbours said they heard 'windows 
popping' at the three-storey property under the pressure of a torrent of
surface water which had been washed down the road behind the building, 
split into three flats.

Devon
and Cornwall Police duty inspector Graham Claybourn said: 'The property
and adjoining properties were evacuated this morning, everybody was 
accounted for.

'However, one lady has not been accounted for. She lives in the ground flat.

'We're
waiting for a geothermal engineer from the council to come down and 
assess the scene. There was some building work going on at the time.'

A council spokesman said: 'This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the missing woman.

'The
council is working with the emergency services and the Health and 
Safety Executive to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of
the landslip.'

Unsafe: Emergency workers fear a further collapse at the property could endanger the search

Investigation: Emergency workers with the springer spaniel sniffer dog helping them with the search

A springer spaniel sniffer dog, used by emergency services to detect the scent of humans, was sent to the edge of the property this morning.

Friend Edwina Hannaford described Ms Norman as 'a happy, lovely lady'. She said: 'Susan was well-known in the town and was an active volunteer. She was a very happy lady, very friendly and smiley, and would always say hello.

'The whole town has been on tenterhooks waiting for news, and sadly the news that a body has been found is what we had been fearing.

'I'd like to thank the emergency services, who have toiled very hard for many hours.

'This tragedy has hurt the community. But the fact that so many people have been offering to help in any way they can is testament to the spirit here.

'Our condolences obviously go out to all those affected.'

Warning: Susan Norman had previously expressed fears that her home was in danger of collapsing

Evacuation: More than a dozen local residents have been forced to leave their homes

Mr Claybourn said Ms Norman had returned from a trip yesterday evening.

He
said: 'The woman was away but returned last night at about 6pm. There 
are no other suggestions where she might be - she might be in there.

'It has been confirmed by her family locally. She was last heard from yesterday evening.'

Her neighbours today revealed that Ms Norman had previously warned officials that her home was at risk from flood damage.

Sally Marsh, a hairdresser who lives on the same road, said: 'The lady that has gone missing has complained that she is not happy and has told them that this was going to happen.

'She has predicted this and it is just terrible because we don't know where she is or if she is safe.

'There was a landslip in December and all they did was put cones down, we keep telling them and kept saying this would happen but they wouldn't listen.'

The property, named 'Veronica', is one of a number of detached homes along the road, overlooking a sheer drop to the picturesque Looe Valley railway line.

Sandplace Road, which runs along the entrance to the properties, has been closed to traffic for months after a landslide nearby just before Christmas.

The road running along the back of the homes, a main road into the coastal town of Looe, was said to have been carrying excess surface water which locals said was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and uncleared drains.

Workers: It is unclear whether the woman is trapped inside or if she earlier left the property

Retired police officer Pete Temlett, who phoned the emergency services after being woken by a panicked neighbour in Sandplace Road shortly before dawn, described how everyone was in a 'state of shock'.

The 59-year-old said: 'I got a knock on the door at about 5am from the young man who lives in the top-floor flat.

'He was obviously in a state of shock and said his house had collapsed and he had to escape.

'I immediately got dressed and went down to the house with him, but I could see it could collapse at any moment.

'The windows were popping out and you could see the house was moving.

'My immediate thought was for the safety of the woman who lives in the bottom flat, but I couldn't go in there. I thought if I open a door it could collapse and cause her more injury.'

He said he thought the problem - which has resulted in the stone wall at the front of the property falling away - had been caused by a combination of a build-up of surface water and clogged drains.

Damage: This is not the first landslide on the street in eastern Cornwall where the woman is missing

Location: The house that collapsed is in Looe, near to Plymouth in the eastern part of Cornwall

The former Avon and Somerset officer, who is staying with friends nearby after being told he was not allowed to return to his home, said: 'I have been speaking to the council for a long time about this.

'This is something that could have been avoided. I have told the council the drains need clearing but I think we have been treated with absolute disdain.'

Mr Temlett said he submitted a 65-page dossier of evidence to the council, warning them of the problem, but that his calls for help have fallen on deaf ears.

He added: 'This was an accident waiting to happen.'

Many of those evacuated were taken to the Guildhall in the town, although it is understood they have since found alternative accommodation.

It is believed emergency services had to be called in to remove one elderly woman from her home, who was known as a recluse and did not want to leave the property.
