Socks are a Christmas stocking staple but while the majority of us are happy with plain old wool, for those who can afford it, FALKE have launched a £726 vicuña pair.

The socks, which come with their own presentation box, are only available in golden-brown as the vicuña, an illama-like camelid that hails from Peru, produces wool so delicate that the dyeing process would damage it beyond repair.

But those who want a pair will need to place their orders quickly, as just 10 pairs of the luxury socks have been made.

Luxurious: The limited edition socks are made from vicuña wool which is quite literally worth its weight in gold

The socks are part of German hosiery specialist FALKE's autumn/winter collection, which also includes 20 limited edition pullovers, each worth approximately £2,015, created from the same fabric.

The range, which offers a choice of roll or v-necklines, offers a luxury spin on the brand's mainline menswear collection, most of which crafted from merino wool, silk and cashmere.

'The fine wool and thermal properties communicate the uniqueness of the yarn,' explain the company in a description on the website.

'FALKE is the first clothing manufacturer producing socks made of this premium wool. Vicuña wool is the rarest and most expensive wool in the world, being softer, lighter and warmer than any other wool.

'Since the fibres are very delicate, the wool’s natural golden colour remains unchanged.'

Expensive: The £726 socks come in a special presentation box and only 10 pairs of the footwear have been made

Endangered: Vicuñas, which live in the Andes and can only be shorn once every two years, are protected by law

The vicuña is a small endangered camelid that lives in the Peruvian Andes and produces some of the most expensive wool in the world.

Related to the illama and the alpaca, the fineness of vicuña makes it stand out from that of its less expensive cousins.

Additional value is created by its rarity - and its mountainous habitat.

Just to make getting your hands on vicuña wool even more difficult, each animal can be shorn just once every two years under Peruvian law.

Dubbed the world's most expensive fabric, vicuña wool is quite literally worth its weight in gold because of its rarity and the difficulty involved in obtaining it.

Vicuñas, a relative of the illama and the ancestor of the alpaca, are the national animals of Peru and live high in the Andes mountains.

Their wool is the finest of all animal-derived fibres, is just 12 micro-metres in diameter and cannot be dyed because it is so delicate.

An endangered species, vicuñas cannot be domesticated, so all wool is taken from wild animals, which can only be caught and sheared once every two years.

If that wasn't enough, each animal produced just one pound of wool each, making the wool rare as well as hard to get hold of.

But for those who can afford to splash out £726 on a pair of socks, rarity is likely to be just as much of a reason to buy as keeping their feet warm.
