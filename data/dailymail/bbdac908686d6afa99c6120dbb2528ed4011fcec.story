A former North Korean prison worker today recalled the moment a group of schoolchildren were torn to pieces by a pack of guard dogs then buried alive by his colleagues.

Ahn Myong-Chol, who worked as a guard for eight years until he fled the country in 1994, recalls the day he saw three dogs get away from their handler and attack children coming back from the camp school.

'There were three dogs and they killed five children,' the 45-year-old told AFP through a translator.

Hell on Earth: Former prison guards have spoken of horrifying scenes at camps like this one

'They killed three of the children 
right away. The two other children were barely breathing and the guards 
buried them alive,' he said, speaking on the sidelines of a Geneva 
conference for human rights activists.

The
 next day, instead of putting down the murderous dogs, the guards pet 
them and fed them special food 'as some kind of award,' he added with 
disgust.

'People in
 the camps are not treated as human beings... they are like flies that 
can be crushed,' said Ahn, his sad eyes framed by steel-rimmed glasses.

The
 former guard is one of many defectors who provided harrowing testimony 
to a UN-mandated enquiry that last week issued a searing, 400-page 
indictment of gross human rights abuses in North Korea.

After fleeing the country two decades 
ago, Ahn worked for years at a bank in South Korea but gradually got 
involved in work denouncing the expansive prison camp system in the 
isolated nation.

Three years ago, he quit his bank job to dedicate all his time to his non-governmental organisation, Free NK Gulag.

'It's my life's mission to spread awareness about what is happening in the camps,' he said.

There are an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in North Korea, a nation of 24 million people.

Ahn, who today is married with two daughters, knows all too well the brutal mentality of the camp guards.

When he, as the son of a high-ranking 
official, was ushered onto the prestigious path of becoming a guard in 
1987, he says he was heavily brainwashed to see all prisoners as 'evil'.

At his first posting at camp 14, north of Pyongyang, he was encouraged to practice his Tae Kwon Do skills on prisoners.

And he recalls how guards were urged to shoot any prisoner who might try to escape.

'We
 were allowed to kill them, and if we brought back their body, they 
would award us by letting us go study at college,' he said.

Some guards would send prisoners outside the camp and kill them as escapees to gain access to a college education, he added.

Ahn said he had beaten many prisoners but said that, to his knowledge, he had never killed any of them.

Ruthless: Kim Jong-Un had his uncle killed because he was guilty of 'tremendous crimes against the country', according to the North Korean ambassador to the UK

Although he witnessed numerous executions, starving children, and the effects of extreme torture, it was not until he was promoted to be a driver, transporting soldiers back and forth between camps, that he began to question the system.

During his travels he sometimes struck up conversations with prisoners and was astonished to find that 'more than 90 percent' of them said they had no idea why they were in the camp.

Ahn had stumbled across North Korea's system of throwing generations of the same family into prison camps under guilt-by-association rules.

He got a taste of that rule himself. On leave in 1994, he returned home to find that his father had committed suicide after making some drunken, negative remarks about the country's leadership.

Reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un had his uncle executed by throwing him to a pack of dogs spread like wild fire across the world last month.

However, it later emerged the claims had apparently originated as a satirical post on Chinese microblogging website which was picked up by a Hong Kong-based newspaper.

North Korea's ambassador to the UK, Hyun Hak-Bong, also denied the allegations, saying they had been put about by the hermit state's enemies.

Hyun confirmed the dictator's former political confidant and close relative Jang Song Thaek had been executed for 'tremendous crimes against the country'.

He said the 67-year-old had been killed by firing squad, a fate that media outlets said was normally reserved for 'traitors'.

Ahn's mother, sister and brother were detained and likely sent into camps, although he is not sure what became of them.

Though Ahn returned to work, he feared he too would be dragged off. So he drove his truck to the shores of the Du Man River and swam across to China, having to dump the heavy weapons he was carrying to avoid drowning.

Once he got involved in the NGO work in South Korea, he was uneasy about meeting former prisoners who had also managed to defect, like Chol Hwan Kang.

Kang was sent to Camp 15 -- where Ahn once served -- with his whole family when he was nine and spent 10 years there to repent for the suspected disloyalties of his grandfather. Ahn remembered him from his time as a guard there.

But Kang, like most survivors, understood he had not chosen his job and had accepted his plea for forgiveness.

'He met me with a gentle handshake,' Ahn said.

Last week's UN report was vital to spreading awareness about the reality of the camps, Ahn said, comparing what is happening there to the Soviet-era Gulags.

'The difference is that in North Korea we are still talking in the present tense. These horrors are still happening,' he said.
