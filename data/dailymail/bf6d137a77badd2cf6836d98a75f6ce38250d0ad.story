It’s one of best forms of protein and can be used in a myriad ways, from a sandwich filling to a salad ingredient or even eaten as a snack on its own.

But if there’s one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it's the hassle of peeling it.

More often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers, on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food.

Placing his mouth on top of the funnel he has created with his fingers, he blows hard

The video, uploaded by Youtube user KeepItFire2, shows how to peel an egg in two seconds. Tapping the egg on both ends, he peels a small bit from the top of the egg and a larger chunk from the bottom

But one clever YouTube user has found what he calls the cool way to peel a hard-boiled egg.

The user, who goes by the handle KeepItFire2, demonstrates his easy method in the video.

He claims to have conducted exhaustive research online before deciding on this particular method. 

‘Throw some ice into the pot before you do anything,’ he says in the video.

Pointing to both ends of the egg, he then gentle cracks both the top and the bottom on a paper plate.

‘On the bottom part you’re going to want to take out a big chunk of the shell,’ he says, as he starts peeling the egg.

‘On the top you need to take out just a little bit,’ he says, holding the egg close to the camera.

He then cups the egg with his fingers, with the larger end of the egg pointing outwards 

The egg pops out if its shell easily and the home cook goes on to munch on his high protein snack 

With both the top and bottom parts of the shell now removed, he cups the egg in his palm, circling his fingers around the top part of the egg.

‘Take it in your hand and cup it like that with the big end on the outside,’ he says, pointing to the egg in his palm.

‘Then just blow.’

Placing his mouth on the top part of his fingers, he blows the egg hard and holds out his left hand to catch the hard boiled egg as it pops out easily from its shell.

‘There you go, two seconds of peeling a hard-boiled egg and saving you a lot of headache,’ he ends as he bites into his snack.
