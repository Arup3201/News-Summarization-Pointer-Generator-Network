She was surrounded by an array of glittering stars.

But it was Kate Bush who stole the limelight by making her comeback to the red carpet.

Having made her comeback to the stage after an absence of 35 years earlier this year, it appears the 56-year-old mother of one has decided to end her self-imposed exile from the spotlight by attending the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards.

She was rewarded with the Editor’s award for her Before the Dawn concert series at the Hammersmith Apollo between August and October.

Arguably the outstanding musical event of 2014, the 100,000 tickets for the 22 concerts sold out within minutes in March.

Supermodel Naomi Campbell, 44, ensured she caught attention by opting for a gold sequinned dress slashed to the navel and split to her thigh.

Gillian Anderson , 46, picked up the best actress gong for her role in a Streetcar Named Desire at the Young Vic theatre. The X Files star made a solo appearance on the red carpet for what seemed very much like a night for couples.

Benedict Cumberbatch, 38, arrived with his fiancée Sophie Hunter, 36, and Billie Piper, 32, who was nominated in the best actress category, was with her husband Laurence Fox, 36.

Sophie Hunter was wearing a black and orange sleeveless satin gown by Erdem.

Miss Piper wore a black fan-style one-shoulder vintage dress. She was nominated for her role in the play Great Britain.

Miss Bush opted for an elegant black trouser suit and black shawl.
