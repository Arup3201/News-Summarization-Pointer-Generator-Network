The peregrine falcon is the fastest member of the animal kingdom and is renowned for its speedy hunting swoop, which it uses to catch prey.

While the birds are much admired, exactly how they achieve speeds of 200mph and precision when diving has remained a mystery.

But now a team of German scientists have studied the falcons using a series of cameras to investigate the birds’ aerodynamics, and have discovered that their feathers 'pop up' to reduce drag.

The peregrine falcon - or duck hawk - is renowned for its speed, reaching more than 200mph (322kph) during its hunting swoop.

It is the fastest member of the animal kingdom.

The fastest swoop ever measured was 242mph (389kh) according to National Geographic.

The bird can be found everywhere on the planet except for extreme polar regions, very high mountains and tropical rainforests, making it the world's most widespread raptor.

Peregrine falcons eat medium-sized birds which they usually catch in flight.

They typically measure between 12.5in (34cm) to 22in (58cm) in length, with females being up to a third larger than males.

The birds catch prey by diving from a height at blistering speeds of up to 200mph (322kph), making it hard for scientists to see exactly what is going on.

To solve this, researchers from the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology and the universities of Bonn and Giessen, trained a small number of falcons to dive from the top of a dam to the bottom to retrieve a treat.

They did this so they could follow the birds' flight over a predictable path, making it easy to map, according to the study published in the Plos One journal.

High speed cameras focused on different parts of the dam wall - which measured 200ft (60metres) tall - filmed the birds from different angles and the scientists used the footage to work out the bird’s diving trajectory.

By analysing the data and videos of the birds in flight, the scientists discovered that small feathers (circled) pop up between the birds' wings to boost its aerodynamics at its top speed during the dives and keep air flowing smoothly over its body.

This is almost impossible as there are no markers or reference points when filming the birds in the wild.

Armed with data, the researchers created a 3D plastic model of a peregrine falcon as if it was diving at full speed and analysed it in a wind tunnel.

They looked at the flow of air over the model's surface by applying a thin layer of oil paint to the model and examining the streaking patterns left behind, which gave them an idea of wind flow lines.

They also tracked the movement of tiny particles illuminated with a laser in the wind tunnel, to see how they travelled over the surface of the bird, according to Plos Blogs.

By analysing the data and videos of the birds in flight, the scientists discovered that small feathers pop up between the birds’ wings on its back to boost its aerodynamics at its top speed during the dives and keep air flowing smoothly over its body.

The pop-up feathers reduce drag and can be linkened to the flaps on an aeroplane’s wing, or even an aerofoil on a sports car.

The researchers  found that the typical shape of the birds' bodies and wings at maximum diving speed in the experiment made a V-shape. They used this shape to make a 3D model (pictured bottom) to analyse in a wind tunnel

‘High-resolution pictures of the diving peregrine indicate that feathers pop-up in the equivalent regions, where flow separation in the model falcon occurred,’ the scientists wrote in their paper.

They also found that the typical shape of the birds’ bodies and their wings at maximum diving speed in the experiment made a V-shape.

‘The leading edge of the wing is not straight but has a wavy structure with grooves in the gaps between the neck and both shoulders,’ according to the study.

Peregrine falcons were once endangered in the U.S. but the population has made a comeback after the ban of DDT and other pesticides in the 1970s.

This is the 3D flight path of the falcon, which is color-coded to show how fast it travels during different parts of its dive. Red colours denote the fastest part of its dive, with deep blue being the slowest. The bird had a maximum velocity of 22.5metres per second
