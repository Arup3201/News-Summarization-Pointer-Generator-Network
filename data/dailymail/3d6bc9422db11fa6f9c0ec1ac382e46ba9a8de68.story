Sales of compilation albums have soared to more than 20 million as music-lovers look to save money on buying individual tracks from iTunes.

Purchases increased by an incredible 7.2 per cent last year to 20.6million and the Now! franchise had its best sales figures for 11 years according to the official UK charts.

And their latest release, Now That’s What I Call Music! 84, is the fast-selling album so far this year.

That's what I call a comeback! Old-fashioned compilation album sales have soared to more than 20 million with Now That's What I Call Music! 83 the number one compilation for 2012

The comeback has defied the music-buying trends of modern consumers who tend to download one or two tracks rather than buying an entire album.

They cost between 
£10-12 and contain up to 40 songs which is equivalent to paying just 28.5p 
per song - a third of the price of downloading an individual song, which cost around 99p.

The Now series had nine compilation albums in the top 20 including reggae, Disney and Christmas albums and 26 compilation albums sold more than 100,000 copies each.

One in four were sold as a download and the genre was responsible for a fifth of all albums sold in 2012.

Top sellers also included Isles of Wonder, a compilation of songs played during the London Olympic Games opening ceremony, Radio One’s Live Lounge series in which famous bands and solo artists perform each other’s songs and dance collections Ministry of Sound.

British Recorded Music Industry (BPI) chief executive Geoff Taylor said the collections were defying British music buying trends.

He said: ‘Despite the availability of tracks as individual downloads, compilations - led by the Now series - are confounding expectations and performing better than ever.

‘Not only are music fans getting superb value from double and triple album titles brimming with hits, but a string of newly-themed albums have established themselves over the last year.’

The charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company which operates in London. It is a joint venture between BPI and the Entertainment Retailers Association. The charts are based on a survey across a panel of retailers which accounts for 99 per cent of all singles sold, 98 per cent of all albums and over 90 per cent of video.

Original vinyl versions of the Now 
series, which started in 1983, have become valuable 
collectibles worth up to £200 each it was revealed this week.

The original Now That's What I call Music compilation album was released in 1983

The Now That’s What I Call Music! franchise, often shortened to Now!, was launched in the UK in 1983.

The first album included 11 number one singles and a collection of 30 tracks from 1983 and was released on double vinyl LP and cassette. It was unlike other compilations at the time which were edited to fit the running time.

The series is a collaboration between EMI and Virgin which allows a greater number of major hits to be included.

The idea for the series started at Richard Branson’s Virgin Records offices in Vernon Yard, just off Portobello Road. Mr Branson bought a 1920s Danish Bacon poster of a pig singing Now That’s What I Call Music! to a chicken producing an egg, and gave it to his cousin Simon Draper, then the head of A&R at Virgin Records and later Managing Director. Mr Draper hung the poster in his office and during a meeting with Peter Jamieson, then the managing director of EMI Records, the poster caught his eye and the name of the series was born.

There have been a number of spin-off compilations including Now Dance and Now Smash Hits which went on to release their own compilations.

The series continues today and also exists in several other countries including Argentina, Israel and South Africa.

Original vinyl versions of the series have become valuable collectibles worth up to £200 each.
