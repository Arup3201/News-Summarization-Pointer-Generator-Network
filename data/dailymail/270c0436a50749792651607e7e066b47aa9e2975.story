A mother has lost an incredible ten dress sizes in as many months after taking drastic action to save the health of her and her daughter.

Kathryn Swan, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, saw her weight rocket following her wedding to husband Andrew 22 years ago.

The 39-year-old ballooned to a size 32 in clothes as she and her husband and daughter lived on a diet of pie and mash, takeaways and other unhealthy food, and rarely ate fresh fruit and vegetables.

But, when her daughter Bronwyn, 12, began to be picked on at school about her mother's weight, Katherine decided to take action and has got down to a svelte size 12.

Kathryn's doctor offered her two months free at her local Slimming World club to help her shift the pounds

Kathryn 'had always been big', as she was 'brought up on proper meals, and had a weakness for biscuits'

With sky-high blood pressure, Kathryn's doctor offered her two months free at her local Slimming World club to help her shift the pounds and reduce the risk of further health problems.

Kathryn said: 'I have always been big, I was brought up on proper meals, and I've got a weakness for biscuits!

'I slimmed down when I got married, which I found easy, I think because I had a serious goal to work for.

'But when I tried to lose weight after that, it never worked. I tried loads of fad diets but I don't think I was motivated enough to lose significant amounts.

Kathryn, pictured with daughter Bronwyn, didn't want her being picked on

'I didn't want Bronwyn being picked on either. She had never been fat, but children can be cruel and she was getting to the age where girls in particular were very conscious about their weight.'

Kathryn swapped stodgy meals and packets
of biscuits for healthy salads and carrot sticks and saw eight pounds 
drop off her in the first week on the diet.

Breakfast: Bacon Sandwich

Mid-morning snack: Shortbread biscuits

Lunch: Fish and Chips

Dinner: Toasted Sandwich

Supper: Hot Chocolate and biscuits

Snacks: Crisps

Breakfast: Magic Porridge - oats & yoghurt

Mid-morning snack: Chopped fruit and veg

Lunch: Chicken salad

Dinner: Chicken curry with rice

But the housewife, whose husband Andrew works as a train driver, admits that it wasn't easy to begin with.

She said: 'Going through the doors to Slimming World was terrifying. I felt like everyone was looking at me.

'But everyone was so welcoming. At the 
end of the day we were all there for the same reason and it was good to 
have people around me spurring me on.'

The Slimming World diet plan involves food optimising, allowing slimmers to eat what they want but in moderation, to try and avoid binging due to cravings.

Kathryn said: 'We are allowed to have 15 'sins' a day which works out at 105 a week. A cream cake for example is 40 sins, so it made you think about how many you would have left that week and whether it was really worth it.

'If I was going out for a big meal, I
would tend to use all my sins on one night, knowing then that I'd had 
my treat for the week and had to be good until the following week.'

Kathryn
quickly left behind baggy tops and elasticated waistlines as she 
regained a figure and was able to shop on the high street for more 
fitted outfits.

And last week, she proudly pulled on a pair of jeans ten sizes smaller than her old jogging bottoms.

Kathryn thinks her choosing to lose weight brought her and daughter Bronwyn 'closer than we ever had been before' - and she quickly wanted to swap snacking on chocolate for carrot sticks

As
Kathryn has become healthier and gained bags of energy, her daughter 
Bronwyn began to take an interest in leading a better lifestyle.

'It
was amazing how Bronwyn's outlook on food changed,' said Kathryn. 'I 
never forced her to eat differently, she was just interested in what I 
was having and began to prefer my meals.'

The
mother and daughter started cooking healthy and nutritious dinners 
together, as well as going to swimming together, or playing on Bronwyn's
Wii Fit.

Kathryn said: 'I think me choosing to lose weight brought us closer than we ever had been before.

'We did so many activities together, and the best part was, we enjoyed them.Â 

'When Andrew is away, Bronwyn and I snuggle up together in bed and watch a DVD.

'But she quickly wanted to swap snacking on chocolate for carrot sticks.'

While
Kathryn has now reached her target weight, she is planning on 
continuing with the Slimming World classes to keep up her motivation to 
stay slim.

Kathryn 
said: 'I think you need the fear factor when losing weight. Without 
having to go and stand on those scales every week, I think it would be 
very easy to put the weight back on.

'Also
I would miss going to the sessions. I have become close with a lot of 
the other members and with the group leader. I think I would miss it if I
left.'
