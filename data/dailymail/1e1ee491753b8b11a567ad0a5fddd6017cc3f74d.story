The personal aide of one-time Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney blasted Barack Obama's former top adviser on Wednesday for saying Romney once claimed the president's win in 2012 was the product of an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation tageting blacks.

Garrett Jackson said political strategist David Axelrod told a 'ridiculous ... lie' about a phone call between the two politicians on Election Night. 

Romney, according to a new memoir by Axelrod, ticked off Obama on one of the most important nights of his life when he called to concede the race, saying, 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.'

That's how Obama remembers it, according to Axelrod, who writes that the president concluded: 'In other words, black people. That's what he (Romney) thinks this was all about.'

Garret told CBS News on Wednesday that he was in the room listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and it never happened.

MAKING THE CALL: On Election Night 2012, Mitt Romney called Barack Obama to congratulate him – and that phoen call is the subjuct of controversy with one campaign consultant calling the other a liar

Jackson said Romney's comments were: 'Mr. President, I want to congratulate you and your team on a hard-fought race and your victory. ...There are a lot of tough issues facing the country ... and I hope you tackle those tough issues.'

'I'm happy to help in any way,' the aide recalled ROmney as saying on the phone. 'Ann and I will pray for you daily; you have a tough job ahead.' 

Axelrod, a longtime Obama campaign insider, made the claim that Romney linked his loss to the race of Obama's political base in a book due for a Feb. 10 release

Obama was 'unsmiling during the call, and slightly irritated when it was over,' he wrote.

Jackson said neither man was on a speakerphone – something photos of the historic moment on both ends of the call confirms. So no one in Obama's Chicago hotel room, other than the president himself, could know what Romney said. 

The call was brief, Jackson said Wednesday, and included no specifics about turnout in any area of the country – something he said 'I know for a fact.' 

Mitt Romney's personal assistant Garrett Jackson (right) saw and heard everything the GOP candidate said and did during the last presidential race, and he suggests David Axelrod is lying to make the Republican look like a race-obsessed sore loser

'I just hope this lie is the work of David Axelrod and not the president,' he told CBS. 'It's ridiculous. I was very disappointed they would make that up.' 

The revelation appeared timed for release when Romney would be teeing up his third attempt to win the White House. He announced on Jan. 30, however, that he won't be running. 

Axelrod – 'Axe' to Democratic power players – may have been playing to the political world's baser instincts by linking Romney to a race-based attack when he was expected to be building support for the 2016 election.

If his account is accurate, though, it shows how frustrated the former Massachusetts governor was after late polling showed he had a reasonable chance to win. 

Axelrod also writes that Romney was genuinely surprised he had failed to pull it off.

The New York Daily News got an advance copy of Axelrod's memoir, 'Believer: My 40 Years in Politics.'

Now the founding director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, Axelrod cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the Chicago Tribune. Three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting U.S. Senator Paul Simon.

Axelrod later managed the re-election campaign of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, He later worked for then-Senator John Edwards' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to Obama's 2008 effort.

Jackson (right) shadowed Mitt Romney everywhere during the 2012 presdiential campaign, and says he heard what the Republican said when he called to concede the race to Barack Obama

JUSTICE CLINTON? The president briefly considered appointing Hillary to the SUpreme Court after he clobbered her in the 2008 Democratic primary 

Ultimately he became one of the president's most senior advisers before departing the White House in 2011. His career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in Canada and Italy. 

This year he's consulting with Britain's Labour Party in advance of May 7 elections. Labour has said Axelrod is being paid a 'six-figure salary' for his advice, and that he is working with Douglas Alexander, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary – largely via telephone conference calls. 

Other tidbits from his book include the claim that Obama briefly mulled putting Hillary Clinton on the U.S. Supreme Court as a consolation prize after he trounced her in the Democratic primary.

Close Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, Axelrod writes, made Obama's first chief of staff Rahm Emanuel so uncomfortable that he tried to shunt her out of the White House by enticing her to run for Obama's vacated U.S. Senate seat.

'I don't want to manage the president's best friend,' Emanuel said in Axelrod's retelling.

Ultimately, Obama scotched the idea and kept Jarrett in his White House inner circle. Conservatives consider her the president's sinister, Rasputin-like policy whisperer, even casting her in the role of the president's final arbiter on key issues.

Romney has decided not to run again in 2016, disappointing liberals who yearned to hammer him on income-inequality issues (again)

MOVIN' ON UP? Obama joked that he would vacate the White House and let Maine's then-senator Olympis Snowe live there if she would only vote for Obamacare

And Axelrod writes that during the legislative battle over the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – Obama was so convinced he needed a few Republican senators on hs side that he joked about letting one of them, Maine's then-senator Olympia Snowe, live in the White House.

'We'll call it the Snowe plan. Hell, she can live here in the White House! Michelle and I will get an apartment,' Obama's adviser recalls him saying.

Axelrod also tells readers that the president got a sneak preview of the original iPhone from the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, that he rejected the idea of being anyone's vice president, and that Obama – not George Stephanopoulos – was President Bill Clinton's first choice to be his communications director during his initial presidential run in 1992.
