With their shields locked together and advancing forward slowly, Chinese riot police appear to be taking tips from Roman times in their latest training drills

Like a legion of Roman soldiers in perfect tortoise formation, they hold their defensive line leaving barely a gap between their shields to protect their heads and bodies from flying objects.

It is one of the techniques guards in Beijing are planning to use should they be called into action when China marks the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.

Adopting a technique similar to the Roman 'testudo' formation, groups of Chinese police protect their heads and bodies with shields during a series of training drills

Flash point: Beijing police officers, including the elite Snow Leopard Commando Unit, practice their skills ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown

Advancing: With their shields close together, scores of Chinese police march forward while water cannons are deployed behind them during training drills in Beijing

The Snow Leopard unit were testing out their weapons against baying crowds, including multi-coloured spray

The training drill bears a striking resemblance to the ‘testudo’ formation used by groups of Roman centurions where men would align their shields to protect them from flying arrows from the front, top, side and back.

Their training also comes following a series of separatist attacks across the nation.

Just a week ago attackers hurled bombs from two SUVs that plowed through shoppers at a busy street market in China's volatile northwestern region of Xinjiang, killing 31 people and wounding more than 90.

In this training drill, police surround and storm onto a bus. The training comes following a string of separatist attacks around China recently

The early morning attack in the city of Urumqi was the bloodiest in a series of violent incidents over recent months that Chinese authorities have blamed on radical separatists from the country's Muslim Uighur minority

Police officers in Beijing, including China’s elite Snow Leopard Commando Unit, have since been seen showing off their skills at handling terrorist attacks, hijackings and large-scale protests.

The drills come ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square tragedy in which pro-democracy demonstrations turned to bloodshed.

China has never confirmed the number killed during the military crackdown, although independent observers believe it could have been more than 1,000 dead in Beijing, with further victims elsewhere.

The Chinese Communist Party branded the Tiananmen protests a 'counter-revolutionary rebellion'

Every year, the government attempts to prevent any commemorations or public discussions of the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown, but activists say this year has been one of the most severe clampdowns.
