Britain is on flood alert with 10 days worth of rain set to fall in the next 24 hours before widespread frost and freezing fog threatens Monday's rush-hour.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the South East of England as 'persistent and locally heavy' rain is expected to cause surface water flooding and travel disruption.

London, Surrey and Kent are among the areas on high alert as up to an inch of rain - 10 days' worth - is predicted to fall over the next 24 hours.

The 'be aware' warning is from 3am to 9pm on Sunday and could also affect West Sussex, Brighton and Hove, Medway and East Sussex.

'A waving front will lie across the area for much of the day, with more than 20 mm expected in places. Given the wetter than average weather of late, these totals bring the risk of surface water,' according to the Met Office.

'Rain will be persistent and locally heavy through much of Sunday. Falling on saturated ground, it is likely to cause some surface water flooding in places before clearing eastwards. The public should be aware of this hazard.'

Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl said: 'It's looking like Sunday will be a dull, damp day and a pulse of rain will push up. There will be heavy rain overnight.'

The Environment Agency said the heavy rainfall could cause localised flooding of land and roads, some disruption to travel, and perhaps flooding of individual properties.

Overnight from Sunday to Monday there will be widespread frost and fog patches developing which will be slow to clear.

The temperature could dip as low as -4C in areas including Oxfordshire and Exeter, according to the Met Office.

Weather Channel forecaster Leon Brown said: 'Monday morning will be bit of a shock for southerners, with a widespread frost, a risk of freezing fog and temperatures between 0C and -2C widely, perhaps -3C or -4C in frost hollows.

'It may be quite icy for central and southern areas after the wet Sunday.'
