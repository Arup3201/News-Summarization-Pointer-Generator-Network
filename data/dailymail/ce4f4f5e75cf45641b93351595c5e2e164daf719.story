A senior police officer who warned that vulnerable children were being sexually groomed says she was ignored because her bosses were more interested in fighting car theft.

Detective Inspector Meriel Buglass, who headed a unit dealing with sex offences, claimed her superiors failed to act on her findings for eight months, during which girls continued to be abused.

In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Ms Buglass, now retired, blames the ‘target-driven culture’ that existed at Greater Manchester Police. 

Detective Inspector Meriel Buglass claims her concerns over child abuse were ignored by superiors at Greater Manchester Police 

To meet performance targets, she says officers were urged to concentrate on ‘acquisitive’ crimes rather than sexual offences.

Details of how white children were groomed for sex by predominantly Asian gangs in Rochdale were included in a report Ms Buglass submitted in April 2010, which included a desperate plea for more resources.

‘I had many sleepless nights over this. We tried our best but the fact is the police failed those girls,’ she said. 

‘I could not have been more vocal about the threats and risks... but I was appalled at the response.

‘Management appeared not to be interested, they were only interested in targets, it was a completely target-driven culture.

'The main priorities were acquisitive crime – robbery, burglary and car theft. Money was being piled into [the investigation of] these crimes.’

And just as political correctness was partly blamed for failing abuse victims in Rotherham – where it emerged last month that 1,400 children were sexually exploited between 1997 and 2013 – Ms Buglass says it stymied her work in Rochdale.

‘They didn’t want to class the abuse as Asian on white girls. They didn’t want to cause a fuss,’ she said.

‘I took the view that this wasn’t about racism, it was about child abuse – but political correctness and cultural sensitivities were important to management.’

After submitting a report which detailed child abuse, Ms Buglass said she had a meeting with Superintendent Martin Greenhalgh (pictured). But when she raised the subject, she claims he used words to the effect of: 'If I choose to investigate it, we will'

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘The scandal of how police and other agencies failed children being raped on an industrial scale is getting worse every week. Police leadership have completely lost touch with ordinary people’s values.’

Ms Buglass, who ran Rochdale Police’s public protection unit, collated intelligence from many sources and sent her report to her superiors, who reported to Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney.

Ms Buglass claimed work at Greater Manchester Police was target driven

It contained details of about 35 children along with ten perpetrators and 40 others suspects.

The day after she submitted the report, she had a meeting with Superintendent Martin Greenhalgh. 

But when she raised the subject, she claims he used words to the effect of: ‘If I choose to investigate it, we will.’

Ms Buglass replied: ‘This is huge, there are massive threats and it will come back to bite us if you don’t do something!’

But she claims she was told to concentrate on domestic violence because the crime ‘featured on performance targets’.

She said she was so frustrated that she took the matter further and was promised help – yet it wasn’t until eight months later that the investigation was taken up. ‘And then it was taken away from me,’ said Ms Buglass.

In 2012, nine men from Rochdale and Oldham who ran the child sexual exploitation ring were given sentences ranging from four to 19 years. Some of the girls were as young as 13.

The Mail on Sunday revealed two weeks ago that police are poised to arrest hundreds of suspected child abusers in a ‘day of reckoning’.

Greater Manchester Police said yesterday it has ‘recognised that it could have done more to support the victims of child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’.

It said in a statement: ‘Since 2010 we have moved considerable resources into child protection and the investigation of sexual exploitation. We have learned from what happened.’

It added that the Home Office put the force under pressure to cut acquisitive crimes five years ago – but targets were removed in 2012.
