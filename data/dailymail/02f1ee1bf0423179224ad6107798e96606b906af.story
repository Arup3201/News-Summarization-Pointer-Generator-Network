Roy Keane has left his role as Aston Villa assistant manager after just six months in the job.

Keane, who is also No 2 with the Republic of Ireland, decided to step down to concentrate more on the international team.

He had been involved in training on Thursday and only informed Villa manager Paul Lambert of his decision on Friday morning.

After a supremely successful playing career with Nottingham Forest, Manchester United and Celtic, Keane has had a turbulent time as a manager:

August 2006: Takes over as Sunderland manager

May 2007: Sunderland promoted to Premier League, Keane named 'Championship manager of the year'

2007-08: Keeps Sunderland in the Premier League, finishing 15th

December 2008: Resigns as Sunderland boss following disputes with Ellis Short and Niall Quinn

April 2009: Appointed Ipswich Town manager. Finishes 15th in Championship in first full season.

January 2011: Sacked by Ipswich with the club 21st in the Championship.

November 2013: Joins Republic of Ireland management team as assistant to Martin O'Neill 

July 2014: Becomes Aston Villa assistant manager, alongside work with Ireland 

November 2014: Quits as Villa No 2 

'Ultimately, my roles with Villa and Ireland and combining my commitment to these have become too much,' Keane said.

'It isn't fair to either Villa or Ireland, so I've made this decision. 

'I'd like to thank Paul for giving me a great opportunity to come to a brilliant football club, I've really enjoyed my experiences at Villa and I wish the management team, the players, the supporters and the club nothing but the best going forward.'

Villa manager Lambert praised Keane's impact at the club, and said he totally respected the decision.

'Roy came to me this morning and he informed me that, ultimately, the difficulty of combining both roles has prompted his decision, which I respect totally.

'In the brief period we have worked together he has been great in the role and I understand his reasons for leaving.' 

The club thanked Keane for his contribution over the past six months, and said they were now focused on finding his replacement.

'We thank Roy for his time at the Club and we wish him the best with Ireland,' said CEO Tom Fox.

'Our focus now will be on working with Paul to identify the right person to work alongside him and to help us continue on our journey to return the club to its rightful place in the Premier League.'

Keane joined Villa's back-room staff in July to work alongside Lambert as assistant, while performing the same role for Martin O'Neill with Ireland, a role he has been in for a year.

Keane was  a combative midfielder in his player career, but has struggled to hold down management jobs

The former Manchester United midfielder moved to Villa  after their previous backroom staff were sacked following an internal club investigation.

No 2 Ian Culverhouse and head of football operations Gary Karsa left at the end of last season after an inquiry into off-field matters.

Villa won three of their first four league games this season, but failed to win any since then, picking up just two points in their last eight game.

They currently sit sixteenth in the Premier League table, just two points above the relegation zone.
