Mother-of-six Hannah Willoughby shed eight stone, took up weightlifting and changed her life – after being told she was too fat to ride a horse.

The 39-year-old was verging on morbid obesity and considering weight loss surgery when she tipped the scales at 17 stone.

However, after being humiliated on a family outing, Hannah dropped five dress sizes using her childrens' Wii Fit - and lost an incredible stone a month for SEVEN months.

Now the nine-stone muscle mum goes to the gym up to six times per week and plans to enter bodybuilding competitions this year.

Divorced Hannah, from Alton, Hants, said: 'I’ve changed so much that it’s been weird getting used to the new me.

'When I was 17 stone I was eating 
around 3,000 to 4,000 calories every day. I would comfort eat whole 
packs of biscuits and I was so unfit I couldn’t play with my kids.

'But now I’m lifting my own body weight in the gym and I’ve got the energy to run around after my young ones.'

Hannah's new toned physique has even kick-started her love life after being single for almost three years. 

She said: 'I feel like a different person, I sometimes even have to do a double-take when I catch my reflection.

'And my kids have been amazed with my transformation too. When I show them pictures of the old me they don’t recognize me.'

Five-foot-eight-inch Hannah had been slim as a youngster but her battle against the bulge began as she started to have children.

Although she managed to slim down 
after her first two pregnancies with Beth, 18, and Lawrie, 17, she 
struggled when Verity, 14, Alf, 11, Francis, nine, and Sylvia, six, 
followed.

She said: 'My weight went up and down like a yo-yo. After having my third child I found it much harder to slim down.

'I’d over eat and then I’d put myself
on a strict diet but it never stuck because when I was stressed I’d go 
back to comfort eating.

'I had a very sweet tooth and I’d be happy to scoff my face with chocolates, sweets, cakes and biscuits.

'I wouldn’t ever have just one or two biscuits – I’d have half or the entire pack.

'I didn’t stop to think what I was putting in my mouth or what damage it was doing to my body. I had no self-control.

'I was rewarding myself with food and it made me feel better.'

At her largest Hannah was wearing size 20 clothes and her BMI had reached 36 - almost morbidly obese

At her largest, Hannah was wearing size 20 clothes and her BMI had reached 36 - almost morbidly obese.

'I had given up. I wore big, baggy clothes that would cover me up and I didn’t wear make-up,' she said.

'I had such little confidence and self esteem that I just avoided any place that I would stick out or be looked at.

'I was absolutely terrified of the 
gym because I was so self conscious of my size. It was for fit and 
skinny people, not fat people like me.

'It was completely intimidating. I was so embarrassed by my size the thought of exercising in front of people was horrendous.'

She finally decided to change her 
life for good after being humiliated on a holiday at Center Parcs, in 
Longleat, Wilts, with her then husband, Steve, and the kids in January 
2009.

'It was supposed to be a family 
holiday, full of activities with the kids but I couldn’t go horse riding
because the limit was 15 stone,' she said.

'I was so ashamed. I just had to try run alongside the children as they had fun.

'I was also too fat for the high ropes and zip wire in the adventure playground – the limit was 14 stone.

'The park also had a little train 
that would take guests around and I struggled to fit in that. I looked 
like an elephant trying to squeeze in.

'I was so ashamed and so miserable 
that I couldn’t do things with my kids that something finally snapped 
and I realized I had to make a change.'

Hannah started her weight-loss plan as soon as she got home from the week-long break.

She said: 'The kids had been given a 
Wii Fit as a Christmas present. It gave a summary of my health and said 
my BMI was 36 – that’s almost morbidly obese.

'I could’ve been eligible for a 
gastric band if I’d put on a little more weight. I was faced with a 
dilemma – do it the easy or the hard way.

'I was determined not to put on any more weight and I wanted to lose it naturally.

'I was too self conscious to go to the gym so I decided to use the Wii Fit to exercise.

'For an hour every night I would do a running game or yoga or step-aerobics.

'And sometimes I would have a go on my daughters’ dance mat for an hour to work up a sweat.'

As her fitness regime picked up, 
Hannah began working out with Davina McCall’s fitness DVDS and she 
bought a cross trainer – but broke it because she was working so hard.

She also cut her daily calorie intake to just 1,100 by swapping chocolate and cakes for salads.

Then, at 12 stone, she finally felt brave enough to hit the gym - where she began weight lifting for the first time.

'The weights section of the gym was a
little intimidating. There were lots of men grunting as they pumped 
iron and only a couple of women,' she said.

'I think a lot of men don’t think 
women belong in the weights section and women stick to the running 
machines because they don’t really want muscles.

'But I wanted to give it a go and after doing some free weights I noticed how strong my arms and abs became.

'After a little while I was able to lift 60 kilos while squatting and dead lift 75 kilos – that’s more than I weigh.

'I bulked out but I really liked the muscly look. Some women may think it looks butch but I think it looks nice.

'I was really inspired by Jodie Marsh
when she started bodybuilding. I thought she looked fantastic and I 
wanted to look like her too.'

Hannah separated from Steve in 
September 2009 but said it was nothing to do with her weight loss and 
they have remained friends for the children.

Almost two years later, she has 
finally been given the confidence to start dating again after completing
her transformation with a boob job and tummy tuck.

She said: 'It was a very strange change from being overweight to skinny, especially as I was single.

'If I was still large I wouldn’t have
had the confidence to date at all and I don’t think I would have got 
any attention from men. The only looks I got before were of disgust.

'But since I lost the weight I’ve 
been getting noticed a lot more. I’ve gone from invisible to very 
visible and suddenly men are smiling at me.

'Women smile at me too and I think it’s because I’m more accepted as a skinny person. It has been quite hard to get used to.'

Hannah, who now has a new man in her 
life after joining a dating website, added: 'I take care of my 
appearance now, I want to look nice before I leave the house.

'I am able to buy nice, fitted clothes, and I don’t dread going in to the changing room and looking at myself in the mirror.'

Hannah is now studying for a degree 
in nutrition and has even set her sights on competing in a bodybuilding 
contest in the near future.

'I’m really proud of what I have achieved. When I look back to a few years ago, it’s hard to imagine that that was my life.

'Everything has changed, not just my weight.

'I hope to compete in a bodybuilding contest soon but I realise I’ve got some more bulking up to do.

'I never thought I would get in to bodybuilding but when I lost the weight I thought ‘why stop there?’

'If I want to bulk up more I’m 
probably going to have to start going to the gym at least twice a day 
but I’m very competitive and I want to be the best.'

Hannah’s eldest daughter, Beth, said:
“We’ll always love mum no matter what size she is but it’s great to see
her so happy and healthy.

'The change is incredible. When I look at her, it’s hard to imagine she’s ever been overweight. She’s like a different person.'

Alf, 11, added: 'It’s strange looking
at old pictures of mum because she looks very different. She used to be
an apple but now she’s an apple core.'
