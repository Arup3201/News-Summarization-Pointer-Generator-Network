The University of Texas is investigating claims that their Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter sang the same racist song used by fraternity brothers in Oklahoma.

The announcement on Tuesday comes as Parker Rice, the conductor of the University of Oklahoma chant that kicked off a national uproar, says he was taught 'there will never be a n**** SAE' by fraternity brothers. 

The national headquarters for SAE, one of the biggest fraternities in the US, has issued a statement denying that the racist song was part of a tradition for the organization. 

New investigation: Officials at the University of Texas are investigating reports that the racist song that caused outrage in Oklahoma was also sung by brothers at Sigma Alpha Epsilon on the Austin campus 

Parker Rice, one of the leaders of the racist chant at University of Oklahoma SAE, said he and the other freshmen were taught the song by older fraternity brothers

However, unconfirmed reports have surfaced online that the same tune was sung by SAE brothers in Austin, Texas. 

And the fraternity, which traces its roots to the pre-Civil War South, admitted it is investigating reports of racist behavior at other chapters around the country.

A former SAE brother at Oklahoma State University told Daily Mail Online that pledges were given 'n***** names' and made to ape picking cotton on the front lawn of the fraternity. 

'Racism is part of our culture,' he said.  

And on Tuesday, a University of Oklahoma student told the Today show that she had heard the song two years ago and believed it was a tradition for the fraternity. 

University of Texas President Bill Powers  on Tuesday said that the dean of students for the Austin campus would look into the reports that the same racist chant was used there, according to the Daily Texan student newspaper. 

The SAE fraternity was disbanded by the national headquarters and banned from campus by University of Oklahoma officials

FIJI, another fraternity on at the University of Texas, came under fire last month for throwing a 'Border control' party, which was rife with Mexican stereotypes

Rice, a freshman who was first identified by Daily Mail Online as the conductor of the racist Oklahoma chant, said in an apology statement to the Dallas Morning News that: 'Yes, the song was taught to us, but that too doesn’t work as an explanation... For me, this is a devastating lesson and I am seeking guidance on how I can learn from this and make sure it never happens again.'

The song, set to the tune of 'If You're Happy and You Know It,' goes: 'There will never be a n***** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** SAE.' 

The student who spoke to Today show confirmed that she had heard the song before: 'I would definitely say this is not an isolated incident.

'It was really offensive to sit there and listen to that especially because they would just chant it and then laugh after and they thought it was funny.'

Powers, the president of the University of Texas, also addressed other reports of racism in the college's fraternity system. 

These include a February 'border control' party thrown by the FIJI fraternity, which saw revelers wearing sombreros and ponchos and going by stereotypical Mexican names. 

Additional, he said that a memo from the FIJI that mandates 'no Mexicans' and 'no interracial dating' for pledges has been circulating online for years - and its authenticity has never been confirmed.
