Three-times Le Mans 24 Hours winner Andre Lotterer is to race for Caterham in this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix as replacement for Kamui Kobayashi.

Caterham claim Japanese driver Kobayashi remains part of the team, although it is understood his seat is in doubt for the rest of the season.

For now, 32-year-old German Lotterer - best known for his role as a factory driver with Audi in their LMP1 programme - will make his F1 debut at Spa-Francorchamps.

Lotterer has not been behind the wheel of an F1 car since 2002 when he was Jaguar's test driver, although he has competed in single seaters from 2003 in Formula Nippon/Super Formula, winning regularly, taking the title in 2011.

Lotterer said: 'I am delighted to be given the opportunity to take part in a Formula One race weekend - I want to thank Caterham F1 Team for this chance.

'I'm ready for this challenge and I cannot wait to jump in the car and make the most out of the weekend ahead.

'I will need to get settled and used to the car quickly as the team has worked on a number of updates and we will need to have as much time as possible out on track to optimise the car's performance.

'I really enjoy racing at the legendary circuit of Spa-Francorchamps, it's one of my favourite tracks and very close to where I grew up, so this makes the weekend even more special and one to remember.'

Caterham claim Lotterer's experience of mixed conditions, which often prevail throughout the Belgian GP weekend, will be an advantage to the team.
