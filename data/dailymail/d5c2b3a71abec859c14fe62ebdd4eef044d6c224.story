A doctor and her four children killed in a suspected arson attack may have been victims of mistaken identity, police said last night.

Detectives believe their house was deliberately attacked and have traced previous tenants in case it was they who were the intended targets.

They have ruled out a random attack by an arsonist or any connection to car or bin fires on the estate where Sabah Usmani, 44, and her children Hira, 12, Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, and Rayyan, six, died on Monday.

Tragic: Sabah Usmani, sons Sohaib, 11, and Rayan, six, and 12-year-old daughter Hira, died in their end-of-terrace house in Barn Mead, Harlow, Essex, in the early hours of Monday

Couple: Doctor Abdul Shakoor survived with severe smoke inhalation while his wife Sabah Usmani died

Miss Usmani, her husband Abdul Shakoor
and their five children moved  to the rented house in Harlow, Essex, a 
year ago from Winchester, Hampshire.

Police are talking to former tenants and the female owner who lived there for a number of years.

Dr Shakoor, 45, an endocrinologist and hospital registrar, suffered severe smoke inhalation as he fought to save his family.

He was transferred from the Princess 
Alexandra Hospital in Harlow to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford to be 
close to his only surviving daughter, Maheen, three, who is in a 
critical condition at a specialist burns unit.

Tragedy: Four children died in the blaze, aged 13, 11, nine, and six. Fire damage can be seen at the back of the house, on the brickwork and the walls are black with smoke

Yesterday, police specialists were 
carrying out forensic examinations of the home and a neighbour’s car 
that was torched at the same time.

Speaking at the scene, Chief 
Superintendent Luke Collison said: ‘I’m convinced the answer to this 
serious crime lies in the community. If anyone has noticed anything 
suspicious we would ask them to come forward.

‘There is nothing to suggest we are dealing with a serial arsonist.’

Asked about other incidents of arson 
in the area, such as two abandoned cars set alight in a nearby street, 
he said: ‘This house fire has a different MO [modus operandi]. The other
fires are not untypical for such a town and we would class them as 
minor.’

Blaze: Fire damage can be clearly seen at the upstairs window and smoke has stained the brickwork of the end-of-terraced property. It is not known how the fire started yet

Although a racial motivation for the 
attack has not been ruled out, he said there was no evidence to support 
it while neighbours said debt collectors had come to the house pursuing 
former tenants.

Yesterday friends and colleagues of 
the family paid their respects at the scene, and pupils from the 
children’s primary school came to lay flowers.

Dr Purnami De Silva, who worked with 
Dr Shakoor at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, said: ‘I saw him 
yesterday and he was inconsolable. Only weeks ago he and his family went
to the Olympic torch relay.

‘He said it was Britain at its best. 
It is devastating to find we are now under circumstances that perhaps 
show this country at its worst.
