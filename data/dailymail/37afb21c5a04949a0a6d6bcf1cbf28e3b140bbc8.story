Respect for officials may not always be at the levels the referees would hope, but Fiorentina seem to have taken it further than most during their game against AC Milan on Tuesday.

'La Viola' players were in the middle of a startling comeback win, and held the momentum with five minutes to go having just equalised through Gonzalo Rodriguez, when referee Carmine Rosso halted the game to get treatment.

Rosso left the pitch, thinking he had stopped play, to receive medical attention and eventually be replaced by his fourth official.

However, the Fiorentina stars took no notice, continuing to attack with no referee on the pitch, until the official, rather angrily, had to forcefully bring the move to the end with several short blasts on his whistle.

Eventually the men in purple realised what was going on and stopped so that Rosso could be replaced, in an incident similar to Chris Foy's injury during Arsenal's win over West Ham this weekend.

However, the stoppage did little to interrupt Vincenzo Montella's side, as just moments later Joaquin scored a header to put them in front and secure a superb come from behind win.
