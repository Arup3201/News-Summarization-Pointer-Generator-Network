With shows like Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor dominating Saturday night TV, you'd be forgiven for thinking we were a nation of crooners.

But not in Northampton - where a band has axed carols from its Christmas church show because people are 'too embarrassed to sing in public'.

The 50-piece Northampton Concert Band scrapped the tunes after audience members felt 'press-ganged' last year into singing O Come All Ye Faithfull and Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.

All is calm: Northampton Concert Band (pictured) has axed carols from its Christmas show - because people don't like public singing. Member Brian Crutchley said: 'We want people to feel less press-ganged'

Instead, the award-winning group's Christmas concert will feature two hours of its trumpets, bassoons and trombones with no call for the 160-strong audience to take part.

Brian Crutchley, who plays tuba and arranges the concerts, took the decision after an online survey last year found only 40 per cent of attendees wanted the carols again.

'We used to play at carol services and when we played our concert last year we pretty much stuck to the same formula,' the 43-year-old software developer said.

'People didn't seem to be that enthusiastic about the singing so I thought, let's try dropping the audience carols.

'We'll still be playing a short medley of Christmas songs and people are more than welcome to sing from their seats, but it's not at all like last year.

'We want people to feel more relaxed and feel less threatened and press-ganged into singing.

Repertoire: Instead the concert will include instrumental versions of songs such as Fairytale of New York by the Northampton Concert Band (pictured), which began in 1919 and has around 50 players

He added: 'It seems it's been quite a talking point locally. We were joking about whether we'd have protesters singing carols outside.' 

The concert will be held on December 13 on Northampton's Holy Sepulchre Church and stars the 95-year-old wind and brass ensemble, which has won several prizes.

The band won gold awards at the 2008 and 2010 National Wind Band Festival and this year took the platinum award at a regional competition. 

Its move was announced on the band's website, where musical director Stephen Bell wrote: 'We will not be short-changing our audience. They'll still get two hours of top entertainment.'

Save the date: The strictly carol-singing-free concert is planned for Northampton's Holy Sepulchre Church

This year's repertoire will still include some Christmas favourites - including The Pogues' Fairytale of New York and The Snowman theme Walking in the Air - but there will be no forced singing along.

Less obvious pieces include Johann Strauss' 1848 Radetzky March and Sandpaper Ballet, a 1950s dance by Leroy Anderson. 

Mr Crutchley said on the website: 'I can understand that a lot people do not enjoy singing in public, even with such a great band accompanying them.

'With the feedback we've had from our survey we thought we'd drop carols from the concert altogether, which leaves room for other popular music for our audience to listen to.

'If people want to sing carols they're better off going to a carol service.'
