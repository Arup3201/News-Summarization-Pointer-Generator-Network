She is the woman who created Pamela Anderson's iconic bombshell image - and helped turn her into a phenomenon.

After meeting Pamela, then a young actress and model, on the set of a Playboy cover shoot, make-up artist Alexis Vogel knew just what she had to do.

'I'd heard about her, she'd been on Home Improvement and she'd just started on Baywatch, but she didn't really have her image - she was a baby', Alexis tells MailOnline,

'She was pretty fresh-faced, but I wanted to give her more of an image. I really, really loved Bridget Bardot, that sex kitten with perfect features, but of course, this was of course a retro version, making it my own - and her own look.'

That August 1993 cover was Pamela's 
famous photoshoot with Dan Aykroyd in the guise of his SNL Conehead 
character Beldar. But it was the only the start of a 21-year friendship 
between Pamela and Alexis.

Stunned by her reflection, Pamela told Alexis, then working on Playboy cover shoots and editorial: 'I have to have you do my make-up every day for the rest of my life!'

By November 1994 - Pamela's next Playboy cover - she was a bleach-blonde vamp.

Alexis says: 'I still have her saying that on tape, I saved it. The rest is history, she's been very loyal, we've been loyal to each other.

'We have a very, very close 
friendship, we're like best friends. After all these years of working 
together and in all kinds of conditions, it's been a non-stop wonderful 
ride.'

At the age of 47, mom-of-two Pamela still maintains her tried and tested sex-bomb image - and Alexis is still doing her make-up.

'Sometimes we go really sexy and sometimes we donâ€™t, sometimes it's more dramatic, smoky eyes or cat eyes,' Alexis says: 'We just did a gorgeous all black and white Marilyn Monroe inspired shoot with her shorter hair. We call the main look 'Baby Bardot' and we have little names for all the other looks.'

The pair are so close that Alexis feels like an aunt to Pamela's two sons, Brandon, 18, and Dylan, 16, with ex-husband, Tommy Lee.

Bizarrely, Alexis reveals that Pamela is a strict mom - which seems at odds with her public persona, admitting: 'She's a really good mom, a little bit strict, but she's had to be.'

And the boys are as far removed from Hollywood's grip as can be - despite having an actress and a wild rocker for parents.

Alexis says: 'They turned out wonderful, independent and little businessmen. There are no drugs. They are very, very polite and I don't know which one is more beautiful and they're very smart, they got the best of both parents.

Having worked in Hollywood for decades, Alexis has more than a tale to tell, and has watched as the seedy side of the City of Angels has ruined friends.

In particular, she talks softly about her good friend, Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith, who died of a drug overdose in February 2007, aged 39.

She even introduced the blonde to Paul Marciano, the Guess creator who put the statuesque model in his iconic adverts and made her his 'Guess Girl'.

She says: 'Anna Nicole was a blast, so sweet and a really genuinely caring person. I introduced her to Paul.

'I hate to say it, but Hollywood gobbled her up, everything happened so quickly for her, all the fame. She wasn't highly educated and sometimes when people are more innocent and they come from a small town, Hollywood takes them off and they're not really prepared with tools and stability.

'Her family was not good, and sadly, she got swept away with all of it. I tried for a long time, I did the best I could to keep her here for as long as possible.'

She adds: 'We had many, many good times, but once she was so messed up I tried to hang in there with her, but she wasn't taking any help that I was offering and we kind of drifted apart.'

Recalling the moment she found out that Anna Nicole had died, Alexis says: 'We went to shoot in Mexico with Pamela and it was raining and raining and we were all stuck in this suite.There was nothing playing on the TV in English, CNN was the only thing and it came on the news.

'Suddenly my phone was ringing, we were in the middle of nowhere and it was a wide awakening to what can happen in Hollywood.'

While Anna Nicole is a tragic tale, Pamela, Alexis says, 'has stayed true to herself,', adding: 'Her parents are there for her, her mom always helps with the boys, they're really good people, and she's very intelligent.'

In the genes: Anna Nicole Smith replaced Claudia Schiffer as the face of Guess in 1992

Having worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, Alexis is now launching her own make-up kit.

She says: 'Most women learn from their mothers to put make-up on, they don't use professional products, but the wonderful thing about my products is that you get a manual that teaches you step by step and in a couple of months you're empowered.

'You can become your own make-up artist, you're getting my 25 years of secrets and techniques.'

Asked for her secrets on just who can act like a diva, Alexis remains tight-lipped, and says: 'I've only really come across a few people who can be a little difficult at times!'

There must surely be those who turn up a little too much plastic surgery that will make-up hard - but she says: 'Not that often, but it does happen. If they've had filler in the lips, there can be a little too much swelling and it throws their face off balance. So I put foundation over their lips and then use powder and use my lip stain to go under the lip line.

Celebrity clients: Alexis Vogel counts singer Shakira, on let, and actress Sharon Stone, right, as a clients

Alex's other clients include Sharon 
Stone, Shakira and she counts American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson among 
her favourites, calling her 'amazing and genuine.'

Pamela has three of Alexis's kits at home, while Shakira has four.

But
 you don't have to be a celebrity, she says: 'Anybody should be able to 
have the beautiful red carpet look at their finger tips and not pay big 
prices and these products work.'
