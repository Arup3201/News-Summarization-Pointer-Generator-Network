Human bones have been discovered buried under a suburban driveway, police have said.

The skeletal remains, including what are believed to be part of a skull and femur, were found by workmen on a job in Purley, near Croydon in south London, the Metropolitan Police said.

They made the find in Riddlesdown Road yesterday and after they were confirmed as being human the bones were sent to anthropologists to determine how old they are.

Remains: The bones (skull, right, and femur, left) that were discovered under the driveway of a home in south London (right). The property is close to a Saxon burial site, police said

Lead investigator Detective Sergeant Kenny Windsor, from Croydon CID, said early indications suggested they had laid under the driveway for many years.

He said: 'Any requirement for an investigation will be determined by the age of the bones and we're seeking the assistance of anthropologists to try and establish this, but we may also have to use carbon dating techniques to confirm their age.

'We are carrying out other inquiries in the meantime.'

Investigation: Police say they will use carbon dating techniques to confirm the age of the remains

He added: 'It is an unusual discovery, but we're keeping an open mind about whether the bones were originally buried there or indeed moved there for some reason.

'We're also aware that there is an ancient Saxon burial site in the vicinity but at this stage, the direction of our investigation hinges on establishing age of the bones.'

No one has been arrested in connection with the find.
