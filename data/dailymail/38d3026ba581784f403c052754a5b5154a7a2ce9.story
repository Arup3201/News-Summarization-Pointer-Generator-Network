Authorities came upon a grisly scene in Brooklyn Monday, discovering a woman who had lived with her mother's corpse for at least a year, putting it at the dinner table for a dining companion and cuddling next to it at night as she slept.

'It’s a scene right out of ‘Psycho’. . . This is one of the weirdest cases I’ve ever seen' said one law-enforcement source.

According to The New York Post, Chava Stirn, 28, was discovered living with the corpse of mother Susie Rosenthal, 61.when emergency services was called to the apartment in Borough Park to respond to a complaint of a foul odor.

Police arrived at this building in Brooklyn on Monday to find a woman who had been living with the remains of her dead mother for almost a year

Stirn was said to be behaving erratically and said she wanted to hurt herself.

Her obsessions had gone so far that, like famous film murder Norman Bates, she even dressed up in her mother's clothes and was wearing the same black shoes and outfit Rosenthal had on when she died.

The deceased's bones were resting on a bed of trash bags in the kitchen when authorities arrived.

Stirn would often sleep next to the remains on a chair in the kitchen, leaving stacks of paper to cover her twin bed.

Rosenthal's cause of death is uncertain.

'She may have been living there with the mom’s remains for two or three years . . . It’s a horrible scene,' the law enforcement source told the Post.

An autopsy will be done to confirm the findings.

Suspicions were only aroused when the building's super tried to investigate a leak coming from the apartment.

Stirn refused to open up to emergency workers who were forced to knock the door down.

They found her disheveled in her chair, with piles of trash around her up to her waist.

She was apparently a shut-in who lived with her mother while the older woman was still alive.

A relative would occasionally leave food outside her door. 

'When I listened, she was screaming . . . [She yelled] ‘I kill myself, I kill myself!’' neighbobr Malka Le told reporters.

Another unnamed neighbor said: 'I never saw her or her mother. They never came out. I never saw the door open.'

Stirn was taken to the  Maimonides Medical Center for a psychiatric evaluation.

Both woman reportedly exhibited psychological problems recent years, neighbor said.

No charges have yet been filed.
