Ronny Deila has revealed moves are afoot to ensure Jason Denayer extends his stay in Glasgow by another season.

The 19-year-old Belgian central defender is in the middle of a year-long loan from Manchester City and it was widely expected he would return to the English champions in the summer to fight for a first-team place.

The player’s recovery pace caught the eye in a Celtic jersey before he was sidelined recently through injury.

Deila, though, feels the exposure to first-team football has developed other aspects of his game and that, rather than returning to be a squad player at City, he’d be better served staying in Glasgow for another term.

‘I hope to do that,’ Deila confirmed. ‘He is in good development here. He hasn’t played a lot of matches at the top level and when you are in good flow you should keep doing it to go to the next stage.

‘When he is ready for that he will go on but it’s also important for us to have consistency going into next season as well.’

Deila has strong links with City following a study week spent there while manager of Stromsgodset.

That relationship helped facilitate a loan deal for John Guidetti and now he hopes City manager Manuel Pellegrini will see the merits of allowing another of his emerging talents to further develop north of the border.

‘I have a good feeling,’ Deila said. ‘City are co-operating very well with us, I’ve done that with them for many years and this has been a happy relationship so far.

‘We really want to do that in the future as well. I have contacts at City, so there is good communication with them.’

Celtic previously tied up goalkeeper Fraser Forster on back-to-back one year loan deals from Newcastle United before signing him on a permanent contract.
