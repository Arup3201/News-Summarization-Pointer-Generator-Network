Arrested: Megan Welter is accused of assaulting her boyfriend after an argument over a text message

An Iraq war veteran turned cheerleader for the Arizona Cardinals has been arrested for assaulting her boyfriend at her Scottsdale home.

Megan Welter called police for help getting her professional fighter boyfriend to leave her home after the couple argued about a flirty text message he had sent to an ex-girlfriend.

When police arrived at her home however, it was Welter who was arrested after cell phone footage recorded by her boyfriend showed the 29-year-old cheerleader hitting and scratching him and yelling: 'Who is she?' as he pleaded with her to stop, according to 3TV.

The argument began in the early hours of Saturday, July 20, after the couple went out drinking to celebrate Welter's birthday.

In the 911 call, Welter claimed she was 
choked and had her head smashed on a ceramic tile floor. She then told 
the operator: 'I'm a NFL cheerleader, I cannot have ...' before her 
voice trails off.

Her boyfriend, named by Right This Minute as Ryan McMahon, told police Welter thought he resented her after she aborted their baby against his wishes a month earlier.

When the couple, who have been dating for about six months, returned to Welter's home, they started to argue about a text message the boyfriend had sent.

As he was questioned by police 
outside Welter's home, he explained he had sent a jokey text
 to an ex-girlfriend who had sent him a picture of a dog. He replied with a message that read: 'Are you trying to turn me on with a girl dog?'

In footage police filmed as they interviewed him outside the house, he held out his phone and told them repeatedly that he filmed the attack, as he denied harming Welter.

In the footage he recorded, Welter can be heard demanding: 'Who is she? Who is she?' as sheÂ  scratched him and pulled his hair while he quietly asked her to stop and let him leave.

In the 911 call Welter, who spent 16 months serving her country and leading a platoon in Iraq, claimed that her boyfriend had choked her until she went dizzy, 'smashed [her] head into a tile' and was refusing to leave the house.

When police spoke to her though they 
said there was no evidence of bruising or marks on her. Her boyfriend 
however, was found to have scratches on his arms, chest and shoulder.

His
 credit card and ID were also found cut up on the kitchen table. 
According to the police report, Welter admitted to police that she had 
destroyed them, adding: 'I fully admit to it and I know I shouldn't 
have.'

She claimed that 
when she tried to kick her boyfriend out he refused to leave because he 
was too drunk to drive. Welter told police she threw his 'stuff' out of 
the house but when he retrieved his belongings she decided to cut up his
 cards.

Her boyfriend told 
police they began to fight after drinking at Whiskey Row in Scottsdale. 
He claimed Welter accused him of resenting her because she aborted their
 baby against his wishes a month earlier.

He
 said he did not want to press charges and, in a later statement, told 
3TV: 'People make mistakes, no one is perfect. I honestly want the best 
for her and I hope that this doesn't take away from the good things that
 she has done for both the NFL, as well as the service to our country.'

He
 added: 'People seem to only remember the bad and it is easy to point 
fingers while standing on the outside. Now with that said, violence is 
never the answer and I honestly hope that this can be a learning 
experience for her and everyone else.'

It
 is not yet clear if the arrest will affect Welter's position as a 
cheerleader for the Cardinals. In the 911 call she made, she can be 
heard saying: 'I', an NFL cheerleader. I cannot have ...' before her 
voice trails off.

The cheerleading team has not yet commented on the arrest or allegations.

Welter was arrested for alleged assault, disorderly conduct and criminal damage.

She had been publicly praised last week, after details were revealed of how the Iraq war veteran had become a cheerleader.

She told Azcardinals.com that joining the military was simply the 'right thing to do.' Welter was then sent overseas as a signal officer.

'I was deployed to Joint Base Belad 
which is about an hour North of Baghdad. At first, it was scary 
you know, but um, it's what I signed up to do,' she explained to ABC15.

While threatened by incoming mortars and rockets at the base in Iraq, she was reminded of another of her dreams when an NFL team visited, complete with their cheerleading squad.

Welter says she talked to the girls and got tips about life as a cheerleader, as dancing had a long been one of her major passions.

'I started when I was three, my mom put me in a tiny, tiny tot class,' she explained to ABC.

'I picked it back up when I was nine, and I loved it, so I danced competitively at a studio from age of nine, all the way through high school, and then I was on my college dance team.'

Service: Welter had previously spoken of her pride during flag ceremonies and the national anthem before Cardinals games

After returning for Iraq she tried out for the Cardinals squad and, despite being one of the older entrants, was selected.

Welter, who is also a reservist in communications for the military police in Scottsdale, Arizona, spoke of her excitement before a big game for the Cardinals.

The veteran and cheerleader told ABC15: 'When you see the flag, it means a lot, you know, because our country has given us so many freedoms and to be a part of fighting for that and maintaining that, it, it means a lot. So yes, it gives me goose bumps, I can't help it.'
