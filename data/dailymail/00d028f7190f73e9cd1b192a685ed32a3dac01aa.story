Phil Collins' Swiss ex-wife has been left paralysed after an operation to treat a slipped disc in her neck.

Orianne Collins, who was married to the Genesis star for seven years until 2007, now uses a wheelchair following the operation in December.

Ms Collins, 42, who has three sons and is remarried, has filed a criminal complaint following the surgery in a hospital in Switzerland.

Married: Phil Collins and Orianne's lavish three-day wedding cost £300,000 and hosted guests including Elton John and Eric Clapton

Paralysed: Orianne Collins has revealed she became paralysed after an operation at a Swiss hospital in December

Speaking to Swiss website, Le Matin, Ms Collins said:  'On December 16 I had an operation for a slipped disc in my neck. 

'Afterwards, I woke up paralysed. I had absolutely no feeling in my whole body, from my head to the tips of my toes.' 

It all began when Ms Collins, who has a black belt in mixed martial arts, skis, and played tennis and golf, had persistent pain in her shoulder and neck.

She left Miami, U.S. where she lives with her husband and children, for Switzerland because of the 'standard of care' offered in the country.

'We have the best doctors here,' she told Le Matin. 'It was the best solution. I thought I was in good hands.'

The disc was removed and replaced with a prosthetic and three days later she was told she could go home.

But not everything went to plan and she awoke unable to feel anything and started to panic.

An MRI scan revealed she had Brown-Sequard syndrome - a rare spinal disorder that results from an injury to one side of the spinal cord.

On December 31, Ms Collins filed a criminal complaint against the hospital, which has not been named, because she 'needs answers'.

She is due to be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic.

Loved-up: The couple were together for 12 years before their split which cost the Genesis star £25 million in a divorce settlement

In 2008, singer and drummer Phil Collins was forced to fork out £25 million to his third wife Ms Collins, nee Cevey, in a divorce settlement.

The couple were together for 12 years in total and have two sons together, Nicolas and Matthew. 

Mr Collins met Miss Cevey on tour in 1994 when she was just 22 and was working as a translator. He was still married to his second wife at the time and was almost double Miss Cevey's age.

The couple set up home in Geneva and were together for five years before their lavish three-day wedding costing £300,000 which hosted guests including Elton John and Eric Clapton.

They bought racing driver Jackie Stewart's old house in Bugnins, near Geneva, for an estimated £20million before announcing their split in 2006. 

Ms Collins, who is a jewellery designer and was born in Nyon, Switzerland, founded the Little Dreams Foundation with the Genesis star.

The charity fulfils the dreams of young aspiring talents without the money to achieve their goals.

She told Le Matin that if she is able to walk again she plans to climb to the top of the Matterhorn, a mountain in the Pennine Alps on the border between Switzerland and Italy.
