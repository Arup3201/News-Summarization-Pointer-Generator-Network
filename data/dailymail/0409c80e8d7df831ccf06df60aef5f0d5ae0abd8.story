Barnaby Lenon, former head of Harrow School, argued at an Oxford University debate that a degree is a privilege and not a right

The former headmaster of Harrow has said that University is a privilege which is wasted on some pupils.

Speaking at an Oxford University debate, Barnaby Lenon, who was headmaster of the £33,000-a-year boys school until 2011, said that 'excellence for all is nonsense.'

He argued that a degree had become seen as a right because of an 'everyone must win prizes' mentality that had developed after the Second World War.

Speaking alongside Tim Waterstone, who owns the book store of the same name, the pair were arguing that a University education is a privilege and not a right.

According to the Oxford Student, Mr Lenon, who is chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: 'Selection by ability has become taboo. But the idea of excellence for all is nonsense.'

Questioning the merit of degrees such as communications and marketing, he added: '200,000 students getting degrees in business would be better off getting a job in a business.'

Mr Waterstone said: 'No one has the right to be a scholar. You do have the right not to be discriminated against, but there is no guarantee to go to university,' according to The Telegraph.

The three were debating against David Willetts, the universities minister, and Geraldine Van Bueren, professor of international human rights law at Queen Mary, University of London.

Ms Van Bueren noted that 'privilege and 
equal opportunity do not go hand in hand' during her argument, while Mr 
Willetts argued that access to taxpayer funded Universities should not 
be limited to a privileged few, but open to all.

Debating against Mr Lenon was David Willetts, the universities minister, who said that access to taxpayer funded Universities should not be restricted

However he was interrupted by protesters who unfurled a banner reading 'F*** you David Willetts', before shouting abuse.

After they realised that Spencer Matthews, from Made in Chelsea, was also at the debate, they added 'Made in Chelsea is s*** too' to the bottom.

Mr Matthews also argued for access to higher education to be restricted, saying that
 neither of his parents had been to University and had turned out fine.

Stephen Dorrell, a Conservative MP, criticised Ms Van Bueren, saying that the last thing the government needed was a humans right lawyer dictating policy.

Mr Lenon has spoken out about access to education before, saying that Universities were unfairly favouring state school pupils and that departments relied on private school students to stay open.

The comment was made in August this year in response to UCL's decision to decrease the proportion of private school students it recruits by 10 per cent, a choice Mr Lenon described as 'so wrong'.

Mr Lenon and Mr Waterstone won the debate by 24 votes.

Set in 260 acres of land, with 12 boarding houses, as well as its own farm and fishing lake, Harrow is a school like no other.

While the 800 all-male pupils are welcomed back each term with a meticulously folded down bed and a chocolate on their pillow, they can expect slightly harsher treatment for the rest of the year as the school operates a 'zero tolerance' policy on lax behaviour.

For example it is a punishable offence to be outside without wearing a signature straw boater hat, which must also be varnished once a term.

However, for those who can stand the discipline, the rewards are immense. The institution, which costs £33,000-a-year to attend, lists eight prime ministers among its alumni, including Sir Winston Churchill, Stanley Baldwin and Sir Robert Peel.

Other well-known pupils include Romantic poet Lord Byron, as well as modern-day actor Benedict Cumberbatch.

Students from the school also invented the game of squash, and current pupils can take advantage of the courts on campus.

Harrow has also developed its own bizarre language, and while even the school doesn't know where some of the terms come from, they remain in use to keep a sense of tradition.

Some of the strangest include Beak, meaning a teacher, Ducker, meaning a swimming pool, and Eccer, which refers to any form of games.

Attendees of the school could also be given a Skew, meaning a punishment, take a Tosh, meaning a bath or shower, or go to the Yarder, the outside play area.
