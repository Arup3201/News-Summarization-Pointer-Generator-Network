Mothercare is recalling two types of £140 luxury cot mattresses over fears they do not have the right fireproofing.

The baby goods giant issued a safety alert after a change in the way its supplier made two luxury mattresses with 'Outlast' heat distribution technology.

The firm is investigating concerns that the fire retardant used in the mattresses may not meet its standards, meaning they would have a greater risk of catching alight.

Check the label: Customers can find out whether they are affected by searching for the style number

Both products have now been removed from the firm's website while the problem is resolved.

The recall affects two sizes of the the firm's Luxury Pocket Sprung Mattress which were sold between June 5 and June 23 of this year.

One
 product affected is the £140 Cot Bed Luxury Pocket Sprung Mattress with
 Outlast measuring 70x140x12.5cm, with style number X7548.

The
 other is the slightly smaller, cheaper 60x120x12.5cm Cot Luxury Pocket 
Sprung Mattress with Outlast, with style number X7547.

Customers are only affected if they bought a mattress from June 5 to June 23 this year.

The two varieties affected are the 70x140x12.5cm Cot Bed Luxury Pocket Sprung Mattress with Outlast and the 60x120x12.5cm Cot Luxury Pocket Sprung Mattress with Outlast.

Other, similarly-named mattresses - including with Spacetec and Coolmax technology - are not affected.

Check if yours is affected by reading the label on the back. If the style number is X7547 or X7548, yours is affected.

If it is, stop using it and take it to your nearest store for a refund. You can also call customer services on 0344 875 5122.

Worried customers who bought mattresses between June 5 and June 23 can check if theirs is affected by examining the style number on the label.

If the number is X7547 or X7548 the mattress should be returned to a Mothercare store or by calling the firm's customer services helpline.

A spokesman for consumer group Which? said: 'It's good that Mothercare are taking action to recall this product if it is potentially unsafe. If parents are concerned, they should check the style number of their mattress to see if they are affected and contact Mothercare without delay.

'If you’re affected by this recall take a look at our advice on baby bedding and cot mattresses to help you find the best. It also includes safety tips for buying and using baby bedding.'

A Mothercare spokesman said: 'A decision has been made to recall the above mattresses following notification from the supplier of a change in production methods which may affect the fire retardant performance and compliance of these products.

'No other Mothercare cot or cot bed mattresses are affected by this notice.

'If you have one of these mattresses please return it to your nearest Mothercare store for a suitable exchange or a full refund.

'Alternatively if you require further assistance please contact the Mothercare Customer Care Team on 0344 875 5122.

'This action is a precautionary measure and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.'

It is the first product recall by Mothercare in more than a year.

Precautionary measure: The product recall notice issued by babywear and bedding giant Mothercare

High street name: A spokesman for the firm apologised for any inconvenience caused by the move

The last was in February last year when the firm raised fears a travel swing had a possibility of tipping over forwards, injuring the baby inside.

The recall affected certain ‘Loved So Much’, ‘Little Circus’, ‘My Jungle Family’ and ‘Please Look After Me Bear’ swings and parents were advised to stop using them immediately.

The babywear giant also had to recall products over faulty fire retardants three years ago.

Issued in August 2011, the problem affected certain Xcursion Travel Systems made between September 1, 2010, and July 19, 2011.
