The Ukraine crisis was lurching into full-scale civil war last night after Kiev’s pro-Western forces suffered their worst setback of the conflict when a military plane was downed by pro-Russian separatists, killing 49.

The Ilyushin-76 military transport plane was shot down approaching Lugansk airport. It was carrying 40 special forces paratroopers and nine crew.

There were also reports last night that a Ukrainian Su-24 bomber was shot down near Horlivka. The pilot was said to have ejected and been detained by a separatist militia.

According to a government spokesman, all of the passengers were from the armed forces, with nine crew members and 40 soldiers killed in the attack

The attacks happened hours before energy talks were due to take place between Russia and Ukraine, which fears its gas supplies will be cut off from tomorrow morning, tipping the country into economic chaos.

And in Kiev, a potentially devastating bomb was left near the presidential administration offices of new leader Petro Poroshenko. A man fled from the scene without detonating the device. Bomb disposal experts found a note on the bomb which read: ‘Unless you stop the war, the war will come to you.

Mr Poroshenko yesterday vowed revenge on separatists for the Ilyushin attack as he declared a day of mourning today. ‘Those involved in this cynical act of terror on such a scale will certainly be punished. Ukraine needs peace. But the terrorists will receive an appropriate response,’ he said.

Vladyslav Seleznyov, a Kiev defence ministry official, last night expressed sympathy to the families of those killed on the transport plane.

Before Saturday's incident, at least 270 people were thought to have died in clashes between government forces and armed separatists

‘The terrorists cynically and treacherously fired with a large-calibre machine gun hitting an Ilyushin-76 of the Ukrainian air force which was carrying troops on rotation and was about to land at Lugansk airport,’ he said.

Militants in Lugansk, who have claimed independence from Ukraine, said the aircraft was downed by a surface-to-air missile. The city is in the east of Ukraine, just 15 miles from the Russian border, and is the most prone to a Crimean-style occupation or annexation by Moscow.

Last week, there were reports of unmarked tanks and rocket launchers supplied to the rebels by Russia.

The claims were given credence by the US. ‘We are highly concerned by new Russian efforts to support the separatists,’ said deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. ‘We are confident these tanks came from Russia.’

The US says a convoy of three T-64 tanks, several BM-21 or Grad multiple rocket launchers and military vehicles had ‘crossed into Ukraine’.

Nato yesterday released images showing Russian tank movements close to the Ukrainian border which ‘raise significant questions’ over President Putin’s intentions.

The crash killed almost four times the number that died on May 29 when the rebels shot down a helicopter

Luhansk is in the east of Ukraine, near to the border with Russia. Tensions are high in the region after pro-Russia militias seized cities, before holding referendums declaring themselves part of Russia

As Kiev continues to try to retake areas under the control of pro-Russian groups, they said more than 300 Russian ‘mercenaries’ had been killed in fighting in the eastern Donetsk region, with bodies piled up in villages, and Moscow seeking to evacuate its dead.

Military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk said: ‘These are Russian mercenaries, killed during the anti-terrorism operation. In Saur-Mohyla and Dmytrivka there are about 250 killed terrorists and 300 wounded.’

The latest developments are bound to increase pressure on Western leaders to impose new sanctions on Russia.

Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland said Mr Poroshenko could ‘count on our support’.

Foreign Secretary William Hague last night condemned the downing of the plane and urged Mr Putin to stop arming the rebels.

‘This tragic incident again underlines the urgency of Russia taking further measures to prevent the escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine by stopping support and the supply of arms for separatist groups.

‘The international community stands ready to impose further sanctions if Russia continues to provoke instability in Ukraine.’
