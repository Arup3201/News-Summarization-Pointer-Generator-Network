Dexter Brady was born at just 23 weeks old in Iowa City and survived despite 1 in 100 odds and now, at three years old, he continues to defy expectations with his normal, healthy development.

Tundi Brady, 45, was expecting twins three years ago. But 22 weeks into her pregnancy, Brady went into labor and lost one of her babies.

Beatrix survived for just one minute. But doctors managed to keep her from delivering the other twin, Dexter, for six days with the help of drugs.

Miracle: Dexter Brady was born at 23 weeks and was about the 'size of a Beanie baby.' Despite all odds, he survived

‘I was saying goodbye to one baby and waiting for the next to be born and say goodbye,’ said Brady.

That’s not quite how it worked out.

At a little over 23 weeks, doctors decided to do an emergency Cesarean and deliver the remaining twin.

At over three months premature, Dexter weighed 507 grams and was ‘about the size of a Beanie baby.’

Sad: His mother Tundi Brady was expecting twins but lost one of them. After doctors managed to keep her from delivering Dexter she thought she was 'waiting for the next to be born and say goodbye'

Serious: Dexter was delivered by c-section at 23 weeks and rushed to a neonatal intensive care unit

High tech: Doctors at the University of Iowa's state-of-the-art neonatal unit acted fast, giving Dexter life-saving drugs to open his lungs and putting him on a ventilator

Getting better: After months on life support, Dexter's health miraculously began to turn around

‘They scooped him up and put him in an incubator and put a breathing tube down his throat,’ Brady said of the moments after her son’s birth. ‘After a few minutes the doctor came over and said, “We got him -- he's been resuscitated.”’

His chances of survival were around 1 in 100 as he was rushed to the University of Iowa Hospital’s state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit.

With the help of ventilators, drugs to help open the lungs, and a technology known as continuous positive air pressure, Dexter held on.

When things appeared to slowly improve for the baby, doctors told Brady and her husband, who is himself a physician, that they would likely be leaving the hospital with healthy baby.

Doubts: Even Dexter's father, himself a physician, found it hard to believe he was finally taking home his son

Survivor: The Bradys were finally able to take Dexter home after months of waiting

Growing up: Now three years old, Dexter (here with his dad) is developing normally, other than being a bit short for his age

Joyful: 'He can pretty much do what any 3-year-old can do,' says Tundi Brady

But Brady’s husband, who’d done a rotation at the very same neonatal unit over a decade previously, didn’t believe it.

'I couldn't figure out why they were lying to me,’ he told his wife at the time.

After two months on life support, however, the doctors were proven correct. The Bradys took Dexter home.

Now three years old, he continues to defy the odds.

Not just surviving, Dexter is thriving and shows no abnormalities other than being short for his age.

‘He can pretty much do what any 3-year-old can do,’ said Brady.
