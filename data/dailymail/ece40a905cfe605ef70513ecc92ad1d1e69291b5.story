With the U.S. facing massive overcrowding in its prisons, Attorney General Eric Holder today announced that the Department of Justice will scale back the use of mandatory minimum prison terms for certain drug-related crimes.

Holder said he would alter Justice Department policy so that low-level, 
nonviolent drug offenders with no ties to large-scale organizations, 
gangs or cartels won't be charged with offenses that impose those mandatory 
minimum sentences.

America, he told a meeting of the American Bar Association, will begin 'fundamentally rethinking the notion of mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes.'

While leaks of Holder's remarks made news Monday morning, no major news outlet noted the racial component to what Holder announced.

But Holder himself brought race to the front burner.

In a speech in front of the American Bar Association in San Francisco, Eric Holder announced major changes to how the federal government will prosecute minor drug cases

'People of color' in the federal criminal justice system 'often face harsher punishments than their peers,' he said.

Should low-level drug offenders be sent for treatment instead of federal prison?

'One deeply troubling report, 
released in February, indicates that – in recent years – black male 
offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those 
imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes.  This isn’t just 
unacceptable – it is shameful.'

Holder said he had 'directed a group 
of U.S. Attorneys to examine sentencing disparities, and to develop 
recommendations on how we can address them.'

His frank comments about race in the justice system will come as a surprise to some, and welcome news to others.

Ohio State University law professor Doug
 Berman told MailOnline that 'there's usually an eagerness in the 
government to avoid talking about the racial overlay in criminal 
justice policy.'

'But just as we saw the comments about Trayvon Martin from
 the president, or Attorney General Holder's willingness to give us a 
preview of this speech back in April when he spoke to Al Sharpton's 
National Action Network, these issues are necessarily more salient for 
an African-American AG serving an African-American president.'

'They grew up in communities of 
color,' Berman said, 'places that are disproportionately affected by 
this kind of imprisonment and this kind of crime.'

Hilary Shelton, the director of the 
the NAACP's Washington Bureau and the group's senior vice president for 
policy and advocacy, said Holder's message is long overdue.

Race 'is a major component' in the lack of fairness in sentencing laws, Shelton told MailOnline.

'There's a need for us to address these overly punitive measures, especially when there's a racial component.' 

Ending the War on Drugs? Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to announce a new policy scaling back mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders in an attempt to reduce U.S. prison populations

The nation's dozens of federal prisoners are 40percent over-capacity. Some 219,000 men and women are serving federal prison time, many of them drug offenders

'Congress addressed this' by 
recalibrating the sentencing disparities in 2010,' Shelton said, and 'they 
noted the racial differences in sentencing as well.'

But differences in how blacks and 
whites are treated in federal courts, said Shelton, 'affect too many 
people. Racial disparities have a huge impact, but in addition we also 
have major disparities in income – in class.'

'We're delighted that this issue is getting the attention it deserves.'

Some sort of reform is needed, says the American Civil Liberties Union, even if it's not informed by perceptions of racism. Fully
 60 per cent of federal drug offenders, the ACLU notes, received 
mandatory minimum sentences in 2012. One-third of them were sentenced to
 10-year terms or longer.

Typically under federal law, crack 
cocaine users – most often black defendants – who possess only 28 grams 
of the drug are charged with felonies. Meanwhile, historically white 
powder cocaine users are not charged with felonies unless they are 
caught with 500 grams.

That 18-to-1 disparity was 100-to-1 
until Congress acted in 2010. But incarceration at the federal level, 
say some, is still applied in a fashion that appears to play racial 
favorites.

'As the so-called “war on drugs” 
enters its fifth decade,' Holder said Monday, 'we need to ask whether 
it, and the approaches that comprise it, have been truly effective – and
 build on the Administration’s efforts, led by the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy, to usher in a new approach.'

'Some statutes that mandate 
inflexible sentences ... have had a destabilizing effect on particular 
communities, largely poor and of color,' he added. And, applied 
inappropriately, they are ultimately counterproductive.'

An estimated 9 to 10 million people - many of them arrested for drug possession - pass through local jails every year

Part of that dysfunction involves 
overcrowding in the federal prison system, which is now 40 per cent over
 capacity with 219,000 inmates.But some states have experimented with reforms that the federal government has noted with surprise.

'In Texas,' Holder said Monday, 
'investments in drug treatment for nonviolent offenders and changes to 
parole policies brought about a reduction in the prison population of 
more than 5,000 inmates last year alone. The same year, similar efforts 
helped Arkansas reduce its prison population by more than 1,400.'

'Federal prosecutors, he explained, 
'cannot – and should not – bring every case or charge every defendant 
who stands accused of violating federal law.'

Holder specifically noted the racial implications of the rule change and said 'people of color' are often treated more harshly by the federal justice system

Devolving some cases to state or 
local law enforcers, he suggested, would free up federal government 
resources while also emphasizing community-level policing.

It has become easier for the federal government to act, said Berman, the Ohio State law professor, now that 'deep-red states like Texas, Georgia, Alabama – just to name a few – have been notably successful with these kinds of reforms.'

'I know the DOJ has been emphasizing 
this in a number of way, but now it can be done properly,' Berman told 
MailOnline, 'because it appears that this is what's sensible regardless 
of your politics, and regardless of your perceptions of what's "soft" or
 "hard" on drugs.'

'The evolving politics in the last five years have made this possible.'

'Democrats are suddenly saying, much like the Republicans have, that we trust the states to do this,' Berman added.

'I don't think this represents a 
broader sense of the Obama administration being on board with cutting 
funds in Washington and putting power back in the states – like helping Rick Perry remember which three cabinet departments to cut – but it does provide the White House with a good opportunity to play nice with the right.'

Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, a former federal 
prosecutor in the United States Attorney’s Office in Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, told MailOnline that 'mandatory minimum sentences have ... 
unfairly targeted minorities' and 'led to prosecutorial abuses, 
especially when law enforcement find a firearm anywhere remotely close 
to where drugs were found.'

'For example, if law enforcement stop
 a courier on the highway transporting drugs and agents also find a 
firearm somewhere in the vehicle, this courier would be facing not only
 a mandatory minimum of 10 years for the drug offense, he would also be 
facing a five year mandatory consecutive sentence for the firearm.'

'People of color often face harsher punishments than their peers. One deeply troubling report, released in February, indicates that – in recent years – black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes.  This isn’t just unacceptable – it is shameful.'

Attorney General Eric Holder on the racial implications of his decision

Aggressive enforcement of federal criminal laws is necessary,' Holder said Monday, 'but 'we cannot simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safer nation.' 

'Today, a vicious cycle of poverty, 
criminality and incarceration traps too many Americans and weakens too 
many communities. However, many aspects of our criminal justice system 
may actually exacerbate this problem, rather than alleviate it.'

'We
 need to ensure that incarceration is used to punish, deter and 
rehabilitate - not merely to convict, warehouse and forget,' said the 
attorney general.

Holder 
said mandatory minimum sentences 'breed disrespect for the system. When 
applied indiscriminately, they do not serve public safety. They have had
 a disabling effect on communities. And they are ultimately 
counterproductive.'

Senators Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, Mike Lee, an Utah Republican, and Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, have introduced legislation aimed at giving federal judges more discretion in applying mandatory minimums to certain drug offenders.

'We definitely need the bill passed,' said Johnson, the former federal prosecutor.

'I would not rely on just the DOJ's policy, because that's very arbitrary, subject to change, and each district may apply it differently.'
