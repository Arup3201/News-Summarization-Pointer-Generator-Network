Time Warner Cable is experiencing widespread outages nationwide.

Customers began to register their displeasure with the network in the early hours of Wednesday morning, posting Twitter updates tagged with #timewarnercable from coast to coast.

Time Warner Cable released a statement on the outage. 'At 4:30am ET this morning during our routine network maintenance, an issue with our Internet backbone created disruption with our Internet and On Demand services.'

The company's own website was down for a time as they worked to restore service.

Angry customers: Time Warner Cable customers took to Twitter to vent their displeasure

Widespread: The outages were reported from coast to coast from the early hours of Wednesday morning

'We're working to restore services to all areas as quickly as possible; no ETR. Tweets will be delayed while this is addressed,' the company tweeted.

It's unclear what caused the outage.

The outages have affected major cities including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Tampa and Houston, according to the site Down Detector.

Customers reported busy signals on customer service hotlines and there was a peak of about 10,000 complaints at 6am.

Many outraged customers believe the outage is a sign of things to come with Comcast's proposed $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable.

Affected: There are still several areas experiencing outages, though Time Warner Cable says service is largely restored

A letter signed by Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti expressed his concern about the takeover's benefits for Los Angelenos.

'Without strong commitments to tangible benefits, there is a risk that the merged company may not deliver excellent products and services to Los Angeles consumers, or that the public interest will suffer,' wrote Garcetti.

More than 11 million residents and customers in the U.S. subscribe to Time Warner Cable.

'Is there any way in which @TWC does NOT suck?' tweeted one customer, adding '#timewarnercable #useless #illegalmonopoly #REGULATECABLE.'

A statement from Time Warner Cable states that service has largely been restored, but Down Detector's map shows significant areas are still facing outages.
