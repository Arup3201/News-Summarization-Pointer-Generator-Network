It won't come as much of a consolation after he was snubbed again by England manager Roy Hodgson, but West Ham midfielder Mark Noble has shown himself to be an impressive fisherman.

Noble has been unwinding during the international break with Hammers team-mate Alex Song, and pulled out a monster on an early morning fishing trip.

Song posted an image on Instagram showing Noble with a huge fish in his arms, evidently taking advantage of the extra time off he has been afforded as West Ham recharge ahead of a difficult Barclays Premier League run-in.

Noble is hoping that if he impresses further with West Ham, he will eventually get the call from England

Song posted: 'A man of many talents! Midfield And lakeside général!' with the image, clearly impressed at Noble's carp, which is thought to weight around 50 pounds.

Noble has spoken in the past to Sportsmail about his passion for fishing, but admitted he has struggled to find team-mates who shared his love for the sport.

‘Modibo Maiga, Guy Demel and Momo Diame can’t understand how you go fishing and chuck them back,’ Noble explained in 2013. ‘They say, “Bring it in, I’ll eat it.” I say, “You’re not allowed to do that here!”’

The 27-year-old midfielder was disappointed to miss out on Hodgson's squad once again, even with a raft of injuries depleting the England manager's selection.

But Noble still believes he can make it into the national squad ahead of next summer's European Championships in France if he knuckles down and keeps working hard with West Ham.

‘I have made it clear what I think about the situation and I would love to play for my country,' he said. 'Obviously at the moment it doesn't look like it is going to happen.

‘I will keep playing as well as I can at West Ham and enjoying it every week. You never know what will happen in the future.'

Song, meanwhile, faces an uncertain future after it was revealed that West Ham's board hold serious reservations about signing him on a permanent deal from Barcelona.

‘You just switch off really,’ Noble said. ‘It’s so peaceful. You’re concentrating on your rods so you tend to forget about everything else.

‘I used to do a lot of fishing with my dad, usually in Beckton Boating Lake. That was a little bit different from this (at Honeypot Lakes in Essex) - there are no shopping trolleys here! Then I moved out and forgot how good it was. I’m pretty sure my mum sold all my gear.

'This summer I was on holiday in Florida, on an island called Boca Grande, and went fishing every day. That got me hooked again. We would do it all night from about 10 o’clock to five in the morning. It was one of the best experiences of my life.’
