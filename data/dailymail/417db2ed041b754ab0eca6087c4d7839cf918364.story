Victim: Angela Wrightson (pictured), 39, was found dead at her home in Hartlepool on Tuesday morning

Two teenage girls appeared in court today accused of murdering a 39-year-old woman.

The girls, aged 13 and 14, are charged with killing Angela Wrightson, whose body was discovered at her home on Tuesday morning.

A post-mortem examination found she died in Hartlepool, County Durham, as a result of blood loss and she had suffered 'substantial' injuries.

The younger defendant appeared before Teesside Youth Court in Middlesbrough watched by her parents, who sat at the back of the courtroom.

Her mother cried as she was brought into court in handcuffs, which were removed for the brief hearing. A security officer sat next to her.

District Judge Martin Walker told the girl, who was wearing a fluffy jumper and black leggings, she would be held in secure accommodation.

Separately, the 14-year-old was escorted into the warm courtroom in tears and she wiped her eyes with a tissue. Her father was in court for the hearing. 

She wore grey tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie, and was also in handcuffs, flanked by a guard. The judge said she would also be held in secure accommodation.

Both girls confirmed their names, addresses and dates of birth but did not say anything else. No pleas were entered on their behalf and no details about the alleged offence were read out.

The judge ordered that nothing should be published which could identify either of the defendants. Both girls will next appear before Teesside Crown Court this afternoon.

Abbie Thomas, 19, a neighbour of the victim, said of her: ‘Everybody knew Angie - she was a bit of a character but she was totally harmless and could be really kind and lovely.

‘A couple of times she’s turned up at our door with pizzas for me and my boyfriend. We never asked for them, but she wanted to be nice because we’re nice to her.’
