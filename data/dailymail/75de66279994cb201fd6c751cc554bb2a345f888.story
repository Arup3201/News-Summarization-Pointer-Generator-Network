Police searching for two young brothers who were ripped from their mother's arms during Superstorm Sandy have found their bodies.

The remains of Brandon, two, and Connor Moore, four, were discovered only yards from where they went missing in Staten Island, New York.

The boys' mother Glenda Moore, 39, is said to have spent 12 hours screaming in the street after they were swept away, but residents would not help her look for them.

The boys were sucked away by 
floodwater after Mrs Moore's car stalled and became stuck just before 
6pm on Monday near the 400-block of Fr. Capodanno Boulevard in South 
Beach.

Mrs Moore, a nurse, tried to hold on to them but was overpowered by the force of the storm.

Police found the young brothers about 30 yards off the corner of McLaughlin Street and Father Capodanno Boulevard.

'Terrible, absolutely terrible,' 
police commissioner Ray Kelly said. 'It just compounds all the tragic 
aspects of this horrific event.'

The boys were reported missing in the aftermath of Sandy, which hit the borough hard with flooding

The boys were about 20 yards apart 
from each other, under water, buried by trees and debris, law 
enforcement sources told the New York Post.

After the storm cleared on Tuesday 
morning, officers, dogs and other searchers - armed with shovels, sticks
and pitchforks - had been scouring those marshlands off Father 
Capodanno.

A team of scuba divers were also there to search the marshy area.

At 10:15am today, police in wetsuits found Brandon waist-deep in water. His brother was found close by shortly after.

After the boys disappeared, Mrs Moore
knocked on a nearby door for help but was told: 'I don't know you. I'm 
not going to help you.'

Mrs Moore then tried another neighbor
near her Staten Island home, but when she rang the bell they turned off
the lights and refused to answer.

As the storm raged around her, the 
nurse took shelter in a doorstep, screaming and staring at the waters 
which had just snatched away her children.

Twelve hours later, at dawn when the 
weather calmed down, she found the strength to walk down the street and 
flag down a passing police car to raise the alarm.

Her cousin Nancy Jean, 41, fought back tears as she described the ordeal.

'I can’t believe the way she was treated by the people she went to for help,' she said.

'The first person she knocked on, she begged them and said: "Please call 911".

'They told her: "I don't know you" and closed the door. She tried another door but they turned the lights off.

‘I can’t imagine what she was 
thinking then. She sat down for 12 hours and was just screaming. She was
out of it. When it got to morning she went and found a police car and 
told him what happened.’

A friend of the mother who lost two young sons to Superstorm Sandy today urged the public to 'keep them in your prayers, they're going to need it'.

The woman said Glenda Moore is 'in pain, she's hurting' after the death of Connor, four, and Brandon, two when their car was hit by a giant wave.

The woman, who was dressed in black, was speaking outside the home of Mrs Moore's mother Maria in the Kensington neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York.

Aged in her 50s, she said: 'Keep them in your prayers, they are going to need it. It's a shock for everybody right now.

'I'm so emotional. I have children almost the same age. She [Glenda] is in pain. She's hurting.'

The mother told police that as the water started to rise, her car stalled and she got out of the car clutching the two-year-old son in her arms and her four-year-old son by the hand before they were washed away

Asked about the boys, the friend said: 'They were joyful, they were very happy. They were very good kids'.

When MailOnline knocked on the door a
female relative with a Jamaican accent opened a first floor window and 
said: 'We're not saying anything'.

Other relatives could be seen entering the semi detached $200,000 home and breaking down in tears as they were given hugs.

Mrs Moore’s aunt, who declined to 
give her name, also told the New York Daily News: ‘They answered the 
door and said, "I don't know you. I'm not going to help you".

‘My sister's like 5ft 3in, 130 
pounds. She looks like a little girl. She's going to come to you and 
you're going to slam the door in her face and say, "I don't know you, I 
can't help you"?'

The aunt also said Mrs Moore told her she was knocked into the freezing waters herself by the power of the storm.

‘She was holding on to them, and the waves just kept coming and crashing and they were under.

‘It went over their heads… She had them in her arms, and a wave came and swept them out of her arms.

‘She [Mrs Moore] said she got shoved, and then the wave just took the car and flipped it over. She was knocked down.’

Tragedy struck on Monday as Mrs Moore was trying to flee her home to get to Brooklyn where her mother Maria Lemaire, 64, lives.

As her Ford Explorer stalled on the 
Father Capodanno Boulevard in South Beach, she got out of the vehicle 
and freed both boys from their seat belts.

She grabbed them and put one under each arm - but lost her grip as a huge wave pounded over their heads.

Mrs Moore is married to Damien, 39, 
who works at the New York Sanitation Department. They have no other 
children and are ‘devastated’ at the loss of their sons.

Miss Jean said: ‘They were beautiful 
boys. They were regular kids, they were just two and four years of age. 
They were always well behaved.

‘I saw them on Monday morning because I watch them when their mother goes to work.

‘They were really happy and I know Glenda had bought them some Halloween costumes and was going to take them out on Halloween.’

The aunt added: ‘They're the most beautiful children ever. One's a redhead, the other a dirty blonde.'

Reached at her home in Brooklyn, New York, Glenda’s sister Sophia, 42, said: ‘I’m sorry, I have no comment’.

Ms Moore told police her car stalled 
and she became stranded in the marsh when the left her home in search of
higher ground as the storm worsened.

Officers from the NYPD Scuba Unit fanned out across the Staten Island marsh on the Boulevard in search of the boys.

'Cops were in there hip deep trying to get them,' a witness said.
