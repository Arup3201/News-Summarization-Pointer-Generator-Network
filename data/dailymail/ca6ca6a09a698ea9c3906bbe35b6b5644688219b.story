Police have reopened their inquiry into the mysterious death of a black bus driver, just days after being accused of racism.

In a dramatic move, Scotland Yard said a new team of detectives will re-examine the evidence surrounding the final moments of Kester David, 53.

His charred remains were discovered under a railway arch almost two years ago and officers insisted he took his own life.

Scotland Yard is to reopen the investigation into Kester David's death after complaints of racism from his family

But on Sunday, his family called for an independent inquiry after a damning internal investigation revealed a ‘catalogue of errors’ by police.

They are suing the force and fear he may have been murdered. The family claim detectives failed to fulfil their duties because the victim was black.

The troubling case was the latest to come to light as a racism controversy threatens to engulf the London force. The independent police watchdog is re-examining ten cases in which Met officers have been accused of racism over the past two years. Last night broadcaster and historian Alex Pascall, who is supporting the family, said they were pleased at the decision.

‘It is good news,’ he said. ‘The way this matter has been dealt with has been extremely poor.

‘Whether you are black, white or green, it doesn’t matter. The way police have treated the family has been atrocious.’

An inquest at Barnet Coroner's Court in January last year into Kester David's death recorded an open verdict

A leaked report said police who investigated his death were responsible for blunders which ‘amount to a failing in duty’.

Officers had not checked CCTV footage, failed to cross-reference DNA from the scene, did not examine phone evidence and ignored potential key witnesses.

Mr David died from 100 per cent burns and inhaling petrol fumes. His body was found in North London, in July 2010.

His mother Winifred Griffith compared the inquiry to the Stephen Lawrence murder, claiming it shows that the Met has learnt little from the case.

At an inquest, a coroner returned an open verdict on Mr David after a forensic expert said he could not rule out the involvement of someone else.
