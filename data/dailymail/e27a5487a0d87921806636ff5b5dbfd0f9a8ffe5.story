On Homeschoolers Anonymous,
former students of homeschooling families have begun blogging about childhood experiences they claim have left them traumatized 
and unprepared for adult life.

The Daily Beast reports that Kierstyn King (formerly Kierstyn Paulino) used to write entries with titles like 'The Case for Christians in 
Government'. Now 22, on her 18th birthday King 'escaped' from her
fundamentalist family in Georgia.

These days, she has trouble walking into a church without having a panic attack. She blames her at-home education, which she claims 'contributed to the amount of hurt I and many others who grew up in this radical/evangelical/conservative/christian subculture endured and continue to endure.'

'Fundamentalist homeschooling is a poison,' agrees 'Isaiah', another former student. 'It spreads like a virus, and not just among the conservative Christians 
who form its natural hosts.' 

He discusses his lesson plans, and writes that 'little oddities started to present themselves' once biology and astronomy began to be discussed.

History, he writes, suffered a 'Biblically literalist whitewashing, an almost colonial view of 
non-Europeans, and to top it off, no acknowledgement that anything over 
six thousand years old could exist at all.' 

With titles like 'I was trained to 
torture myself' and 'home is where the hurt is', the bloggers share 
their experiences about the largely private subculture.

As the eldest of eight, King was told 
that her divinely ordained role was to be a helpmeet to her mother until
her own marriage. Then she would switch over to sexually satisfying her
husband and bearing as many children that she could so that she could 
create a future generation of homeschoolers.

Birth control was out - instead she had 
to 'let God plan' the number of kids she had - because he would never 
give the couple more than they could handle. She discusses two home 
stillbirths that she thinks could have been prevented with medical 
intervention.

The Home School Legal Defense 
Association was founded in 1983 to promote homeschooling and protect 
parents from state oversight.

Its founder, Michael Farris, dreamed of 
creating a generation that could do battle with the corrupt secular 
world and reclaim the institutions of American life for Jesus.

'Fundamentalist homeschooling is a 
poison. It spreads like a 
virus, and not just among the conservative Christians' 

Many former students were schooled in 
the Quiverfull movement, which openly discusses the fact that women 
should submit, then bear as many children as possible to add to the 
cultural army.

'Our primary concern is for people to be exposed to our experiences 
growing up in the conservative Christian homeschooling world and to see 
how those ideologies can create abusive situations,' says Ryan Lee 
Stollar, one of the site’s founders.

'There’s a lot of depression and body-acceptance issues,' he admits. 'I’ve seen a lot of self-injury, even 
to this day. When I was 16, cutting was a huge thing, especially among 
female teenagers in our community. There’s also a lot of coming to terms
with one’s own sexuality.'

female teenagers in our community'

Stoller struggled with his beliefs for many years, and after going away to
graduate school he realized that many of his fellow homeschoolers were 
also suffering from depression, anxiety attacks, and suicidal thoughts.

According to the Department of Education, 1.5 million kids were being homeschooled as of 2007, up from 850,000 in 1999. Legally, when it comes to education, parents often have ultimate authority - and in many states there is zero oversight

Since her parents saw no reason for women to get higher education, King was taught 'consumer math,' which was mainly about
creating a family budget, in lieu of algebra. Now she's speaking out so that other women don't have to learn fractions from cookbooks.
