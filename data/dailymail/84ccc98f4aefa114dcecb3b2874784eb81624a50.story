In recent years a warming climate has encouraged wine producers to set up business in England, with 
vineyards now covering 3,500 acres of countryside.

But after a run of bountiful years, many have been left counting the cost of 2012's dreadful weather after the wet summer washed out this years harvest

Now a number of the nation's wineries have been left with not enough grapes to produce decent quality wine.

The news comes after it was revealed that many  British fruit and vegetable crops have been similarly ruined.

Bob Lindos, founder of the Camel Valley Vineyard, says that this year has been terrible for UK vineyards

Nyetimber Vineyard have had to scrap their 2012 harvest because of the awful weather

The peak year from English wine, 2010, saw four million bottles of wine produced.

But this year's relentless rain and cold conditions has destroyed many of the precious grape plants.

Britain's biggest wine producer, Nyetimber, has scrapped its entire harvest due to this year's bad weather.

The West Sussex estate produced 400,000 bottles of wine in its peak year of 2009 from its 430-acres across West Sussex and Hampshire.

But employers told staff on Tuesday that it would skip this year's harvest as the 'quantity and quality of grapes do not meet the required standard'.

The cold, wet summer has already affected vegetable and fruit harvests in Britain and across the world, pushing up food prices.

British wine has earned a popular following, and during the Diamond Jubilee the Royal family sipped sparkling wine produced in the UK

But the harvest cancellation, the first time in the firm's history that will leave grapes to wither on the vine, is the first sign of how devastating it could be for English wine.

Other vineyards expect production to be down by between one-third and two-thirds.

Cherie Spriggs, head winemaker at Nyetimber, said the 'really difficult and emotional' decision to skip the harvest was due to quality.

'I don't know what it would taste like, but I know it would not be good,' she said.

The 60 full-time staff at Nyetimber were among those putting a brave face on it, according to Ms Spriggs.

British wine has started to win over sceptics and even flattened French competition in international wine awards.

Here are five of the biggest producers:

Denbies in Dorking, Surrey, is one of the UK's biggest physical vineyard with 265 acres under vines;

Camel Valley in Cornwall is one of Britain's best known vineyards and their 2008 Pinot Noir Rose Brut scooped the gold award at the International Wine Challenge;

Nyetimber in West Sussex has over 400 acres to produce wines that were drunk on the Spirit of Chartwell during the Diamond Jubilee River Thames flotilla parade;

The 23-acres Chapel Down winery in Tenterden, Kent, won a slew of awards at this years' International Wine Challenge, international Wine and Spirit Competition, and Decanter World Wine Awards;

The winemaker at the Furleigh Estate in Dorset, which has 85 acres, has been named Winemaker of the Year at the English and Welsh Wine of the Year 2012 competition.

Despite struggling with emotion herself as she delivered the news, she said staff's commitment to quality wines meant they responded in 'classic English stiff upper lip' fashion.

Nyetimber's sparkling wines are popular with the royal family.

The 2007 Classic Cuvee was the only sparkling wine serve on the Spirit of Chartwell during the Diamond Jubilee River Thames pageant.

The same wine also made an appearance at the Diamond Jubilee lunch at Westminster Hall where it was served on arrival to 700 guests, including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

Bob Lindos, founder of Camel Valley, Cornwall, said the run of bad weather was likely to push his harvest down by a third from an average year.

'It's a bad year,' he said. 'People are trying to put a brave face on it, but it means there will be a shortage of English wine. It's a bit of a blow for many people.'

However, he also pointed to the flipside of scarcity. 'It will help with price, no doubt about it. If there was bucket loads of it, it would be cheaper.'

He also told  Harpers Wine and Spirit Traders Review that frosty May conditions had led to berries withering.

Simon Bladon, owner of Jenkyn Place told Harpers Wine and Spirit Traders Review that he anticipated his harvest being between 30 and 40 per cent smaller than usual.

He was confident that his vineyard in the North Downs, Hampshire, could still prdouce top quality wines: 'With selective picking and very careful pressing in the winery, we can ensure that we only use the best juice. There will be absolutely no compromise on quality.

'This is of the utmost importance to us but we are confident that we will be able to produce some great wine again this year.'
