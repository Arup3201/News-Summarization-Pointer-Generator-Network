A female sculptor has found that less is more since she forged herself a successful career making intricate miniature animals no bigger than a grain of rice.

Sadie Campbell has to hold her breath as she moulds and decorates everything from dragonflies to birds and mice a twelfth of their normal size.

Ms Campbell, from Dereham, Norfolk, has to use tweezers and a magnifying glass in order to create her works of art.

The 50-year-old sculptor takes up to two weeks to patiently mould each detailed model - some little bigger than a grain of rice - using a mixture of clay and Plasticine.

Ms Campbell said: ‘One of the hardest parts of my job is trying not to sneeze because if you sneeze everything is just gone.

‘The material you are working with is so delicate.

‘I did some tiny spiders once and I had a stray thread on my jumper which managed to brush them all over the floor.

‘I was doing paintings and doing commissions but I was putting a tremendous amount of detail into them and they were taking hours.

‘My friend suggested I do smaller ones so I went off and found a doll shop and it quickly became apparent that it was something that could be for me.’

Ms Campbell has been making her miniatures for about 19 years with only a couple of breaks for the arrival of her sons Ben, 12, and Daniel, four.

Although her hobby keeps her busy, it is also a neat little earner, as she sold half of her stock at last month's Miniatura exhibition in Birmingham.

The sculptures may be minute, but retailing at £15 a piece, it's all in the detail.
