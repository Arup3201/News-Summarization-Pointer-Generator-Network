He was recently unveiled as an ambassador for the government's healthy eating campaign - during which he warned about the dangers of high salt content in food.

But it seems that Ready Steady Cook star Ainsley Harriott is not exactly practising what he preaches.

It has emerged that the chef's wild mushroom risotto contains the same amount of salt as six packets of crisps.

Incredibly, the meal - which is sold in Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda and contains 2.5g of salt - has more salt that a Big Mac burger from McDonalds, which contains 2.1g.

As reported by The Sun, the 55-year-old was unveiled as the ambassador of the Department of Health's healthy eating Change4Life campaign.

Speaking at the time, he said: 'Itâ€™s really important to be aware of what hidden nasties may be in your food. Some of our favourite meals contain high amounts of salt, sugar and saturated fat.'

But despite his concerns, his risotto's salt content gets the 'red traffic light' warning under labelling guidelines set by the Food Standards Agency.

Katharine Jenner, of Consensus Action on Salt & Health, said: 'Chefs have a huge role to play in influencing our diets - it is imperative they lead by example.'

And its not just the chef's risotto which is packed full of salt. His Szechuan hot and sour soup and golden vegetable rice - also have high levels of salt.

A spokesman for Mr Harriott said: 'He is proud of his food range, which fits within a healthy balanced diet and is clearly labelled to help consumers make informed choices.'
