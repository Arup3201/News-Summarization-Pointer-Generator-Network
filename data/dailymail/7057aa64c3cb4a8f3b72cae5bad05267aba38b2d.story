A mother almost died after losing an astonishing 12 pints of blood while giving birth to a boy weighing more than 11lbs.

Rachel London, 29, is lucky to be alive after having a blood transfusion followed by emergency surgery at Ipswich Hospital just minutes after welcoming baby Jacob on April 7.

She was only able to hold the newborn for a few moments before being rushed to theatre with a torn cervix and vaginal wall.

There doctors performed a transfusion, but the mother-of-two continued to leak blood.

She was then transferred to surgery where doctors operated to stem the blood flow.

Her devastated husband Michael feared she would die after she lost over seven litres of blood, the equivalent of 12.3 pints. The average woman has eight to ten pints in her body.

And baby Jacob, who weighed a hefty 11lb 2oz, was also fighting his own make-or-break battle.

Seriously ill with a vomiting bug, the newborn was taken straight to the hospital's special care baby unit.

Mrs London, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Eloise, has now saluted nurses, including midwife Geraldine Davies,  in the hospital's maternity ward for saving her life as well as her son's.

Mrs London, of Ipswich, said: 'There were times when they didn't know if I would survive because I was losing so much blood.

'Without the nurses and doctors I wouldn't be here today - they were brilliant. I can't praise them enough for everything they did for me.'

She added: 'I was given a blood transfusion. But I was even losing that blood and in total doctors said I lost seven litres of blood - which is actually more than is in the average human body.

'It was all a bit of a blur because one minute I'm giving birth and the next I'm going through to theatre.

'My husband thought he was going to have to explain to our three-year-old daughter Eloise that her mummy wasn't going to come back.'

Mrs London was kept in intensive care for two days before undergoing further surgery. She then spent three days recovering on the maternity ward.

Jacob was transferred to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital to be assessed by specialists but was allowed to return to his mother's side after eight days.

Nurses on the maternity ward even took pictures of Jacob in the special care baby unit so grateful Mrs London could see how her baby was coping.

Maternity manager Frances Bolger said: 'It's great to hear Rachel and baby Jacob are doing so well. Their thanks means a lot to the team here who work incredibly hard every day to provide quality care to mothers and babies.'

Mrs London also urged people to give blood to save lives all over the country.

She said: 'It saved my life and it is so important because giving blood can save so many people.

'I didn't realise the importance of giving blood until this happened to me but now I would urge everyone to give blood.'
