A schoolgirl who suffers from a rare liver disorder must eat nearly twice her bodyweight in raw cornflour every year just to stay alive.

Chrissie Augrandjean, from Clacton, Essex, is one of just a handful of children in the UK who suffer from glycogen storage disease.

The disorder means the 12-year-old's body is unable to release glucose, which provides energy, from her liver.

There are no medicines that can tackle the rare condition so the youngster has to eat 250g of cornflour every day - equivalent to more than 91kg per year, nearly twice her weight.

The starch in the cornflour creates a slow release of energy throughout the day, stopping Chrissie from slipping into a coma or suffering liver damage.

In order to consume the dry powder, Chrissie must mix it with water and gulp down the gloopy mixture.

Her mother Jacqui, 48, even has to set an alarm for a daily 2am dose so Chrissie’s body can continue to create energy throughout the night.

Doctors diagnosed Chrissie with the rare disorder when, aged just three years old, she was rushed to Colchester General in terrible pain.

Examining the youngster, specialists 
found her liver had enlarged by about 6cm and suggested that she 
might be suffering from glycogen storage disease.

Experts at St Thomas’s Hospital, London confirmed the diagnosis of the condition which affects about only one in every three million people.

For three years she had to be fed through a nasal gastric tube until her body was strong enough to just have the cornflour.

Chrissie, who has an older brother, Frank, 17, who does not have the illness - takes her cornflour drink at 8am, 3pm, 8pm and then her dose in the night.

Although she is now able to go to sleepovers with her friends, she still has to get up at 2am to have her glucose hit.

She said: 'Some of the cornflour doses make me gag but I found the one that I like the best and just stick to that.

'I am just used to having to have it now and my friends are used to what I have to do.

'It sometimes gets a bit annoying but I guess I just get on with it.'

Chrissie's mother, a voluntary worker with the NHS, said: 'Chrissie is amazing - she just gets on with it every day and does not ever complain.

'I hand her the drink, she knocks it back and then just carries on doing whatever she is doing at the time.

'She has even become a cornflour connoisseur and can tell which ones she likes and which ones make her feel ill.

'It’s just amazing how much of it she has to have every day but it means that she can live quite a normal life.'

Chrissie faces the prospect of having to eat cornflour for the rest of her life although her family hope developments in gene therapy might one day offer a cure.

Until then, they are able to claim back £22 per month from the NHS because the cornflour is deemed to be a treatment for her.
