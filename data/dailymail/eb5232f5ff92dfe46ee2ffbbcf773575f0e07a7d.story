David Cameron and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt were yesterday granted the right to see key Leveson Inquiry documents in advance.

They will be able to inspect any relevant text messages or emails which have been submitted to the inquiry by other witnesses before giving evidence themselves.

The ruling by Lord Justice Leveson at an emergency hearing came ahead of potentially explosive testimony next  week from former News International executives Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson,  the Prime Minister’s former spin doctor.

Danger: The Government wants to see the evidence of Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson as soon as possible

In total eight Cabinet ministers were 
named as ‘core participants’ in the inquiry. These are people who have a
significant interest in the hearings or may face criticism.

The others are: Deputy Prime Minister 
Nick Clegg, Business Secretary Vince Cable, Education Secretary Michael 
Gove, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, Home Secretary Theresa May and 
Chancellor George Osborne.

The ministers will have the same 
rights as the dozens of existing core participants for this section of 
the inquiry, which is looking at relations between the press and 
politicians.

They include hacking victims, Mrs Brooks, national newspapers and a number of current and former MPs.

Lord Justice Leveson said the 
Government’s application was ‘somewhat unusual in form’, as ministers 
were not currently seeking to cross-examine witnesses but were applying 
for advance sight of witness statements.

He said that James Eadie QC’s 
application on behalf of the Government stated that ‘recent events have 
underlined and brought into sharp focus the desirability of advance 
notice’ – a reference to the  Jeremy Hunt affair.

Mr Hunt was disadvantaged by not 
having prior notice of 163 pages of emails between his office and News 
Corporation which were submitted to the inquiry last month as part of 
Rupert Murdoch’s evidence.

The documents appeared  to suggest Mr 
Hunt’s office had been helping News Corporation to win its bid to take 
full control of BSkyB, and had leaked sensitive information to a Murdoch
lobbyist in advance.

The fallout led to the resignation of Mr Hunt’s special adviser and left the minister fighting for his political life.

Chris Hutchings, a specialist in media
law and partner at Hamlins LLP, said: ‘This is a controversial move by 
the Government because the hearing to decide who would be allowed core 
participant status for the third part of the inquiry was held more than a
month ago.

‘The Government chose not to make an 
application at that stage, and the fact that they are doing so now, so 
late in the day, suggests they are reacting to events of the past week, 
and that this has come out of anxiety and nervousness.’

Friends: The PM and Rebekah Brooks live close together and it is rumoured Mr Cameron texted her up to 12 times a day

On Thursday Andy Coulson is likely to
be asked about how he got the job as the Prime Minister's spin doctor before
being forced to resign because of the phone hacking scandal.

While Mrs Brooks could also lift the 
lid on her friendship with the Prime Minister, and there is speculation 
emails and text messages sent between Mr Cameron 
and the former News International chief executive could be published.

Lord Justice Leveson agreed that the individual ministers could seek the status, as long as long as they did not try to question other witnesses or make opening and closing submissions.

All but one of the ministers have already submitted written witness statements to the inquiry, the hearing was told.

Lord Justice Leveson stressed: 'There can be no question of access being sought for the purpose of preparing evidence.'

The inquiry chairman insisted that all the ministers and their advisers must sign a confidentiality pledge not to leak any of the material they see in advance.

He said: 'I mean absolutely no discourtesy to ministers or those who will have to assist them, but the rule must apply to everyone.'

Without naming him, Lord Justice Leveson accused Labour MP Chris Bryant, who has core participant status, of showing 'total disregard' for the confidentiality agreement he has signed.

Speaking in the House of Commons last week, Mr Bryant quoted from a then-unreleased document listing meetings between Mr Cameron and Rupert Murdoch.

It came after James 
Murdoch's evidence last week included more than 100 damaging emails between one of Culture Secretary Jeremy
Hunt’s special advisers, Adam Smith, and a Rupert Murdoch lobbyist.

Mrs Brooks has kept all the texts she 
received from the Prime Minister, of which there may be more than 12 a 
day, it was claimed today.

The Government could have applied for the
special status more than a year ago but last week's furore appears to 
have sparked action from within Whitehall.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt applied today for the right to see Leveson Inquiry documents and witness statements in advance.

The Prime Minister said last July that 'with 20:20 hindsight' he would not have hired Mr Coulson in May 2007, four months after he resigned from the Sunday tabloid over the jailing of royal reporter Clive Goodman for phone hacking.

Mr Coulson, 44, became Downing Street’s communications chief in May 2010 but quit in January 2011, saying controversy over the hacking scandal was making his job impossible.

His Leveson Inquiry evidence will be the first time he has spoken publicly since being arrested by Scotland Yard on suspicion of phone hacking and corruption last July. He was bailed and has not been charged.

Mrs Brooks, 43, edited the News of the World and The Sun before becoming chief executive of Mr Murdoch’s UK newspapers division News International in September 2009.

She and her racehorse trainer husband Charlie are key members of the influential 'Chipping Norton set', which also includes Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha, Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, and Mr Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth and her PR guru husband Matthew Freud.

The inquiry has already heard that Mrs Brooks regularly met Mr Cameron and other top politicians along with Rupert and James Murdoch.

She hosted a Christmas dinner on December 23 2010, just two days after Business Secretary Vince Cable was stripped of his responsibility for media takeovers for saying he had 'declared war' on the Murdochs’ News Corporation empire.

Mrs Brooks’s wedding on June 13 2009 was attended by Mr Cameron and former prime minister Gordon Brown.

Mr Cameron was forced to admit in March that he rode a retired police horse loaned to Mrs Brooks by Scotland Yard from 2008 to 2010.

Mrs Brooks has twice been arrested by Scotland Yard detectives investigating allegations of phone hacking, corrupt payments to public officials and an attempt to pervert the course of justice. She was bailed and has not been charged.

The Leveson Inquiry’s lawyers will not question Mrs Brooks or Mr Coulson about anything that could prejudice the continuing police inquiries or any potential future trials.
