Loner: Iain Merrick was jailed for seven years after putting a bomb in a pillar box and labelling local postmen paedophiles

A man who tried to blow up a postman and made and distributed indecent images has been jailed for seven years at Manchester Crown Court.

Iain Merrick, 39, of Cheriton Gardens, Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, began a four-year hate campaign after complaining that he kept getting other people’s mail.

The Post Office delivered, he claimed, up to 30 letters a day when they should have been delivered to neighbours.

Merrick’s grudge campaign against Royal Mail started in 2008 when he began to experience problems with his post at his flat where he lived alone.

It was claimed his upstairs neighbour would mistakenly get his post and Merrick asked that his own mail be redirected to another address for six months.

Eventually it was agreed that staff would hold his mail at the post office and he would collect it personally.

But in July 2010 he complained of getting post addressed to his neighbour and made several complaints to the post office.

In November, police spoke to Merrick about him harassing Royal Mail workers and he told them: ‘I’m not going to send a bomb in the mail or anything.

When his grievances were ignored, Merrick did build a bomb from nails, razor blades, light bulb fragments and fish hooks then posted it in a letter box near his home on April 15, 2011.’

Postman Ian Platt on collecting duties opened the pillar box outside Winter Hey Lane post office and spotted the cigarette packet-sized device which had a 12 volt battery and two wires protruding from it – each one attached to a nail.

Bomb disposal experts were summoned and the police evacuated the immediate area, creating a 100-yard cordon around the scene while the device was defused.

During the trial Merrick said: ‘It could range from three to four letters a week to 30 a day, more than that. I did go down to the depot but they said they are not allowed to hold onto any mail.’

Police searched Merrick’s home in September 2012 and found a pen drive in a boiler cupboard. The drive contained a folder entitled ‘Dangerous’, which had hundreds of pages of information including an article containing a diagram and instructions on how to make a pipe bomb from a 2010 issue of the terrorist publication Inspire.

He also had a collection of more than 500 child porn photographs and also had an unhealthy obsession with the Harry Potter actress Emma Watson

Police also discovered books entitled Bombs: Explosives and Experiments, The Anarchist Cookbook and Mujahideen Explosives Handbook.

The authorities learned that during his vendetta Merrick had also sent letters to six primary schools containing pornographic photographs of children along with the names and occupations of postal workers in a bid to smear them.

He had also put white stickers around the area falsely claiming one postal worker was a convicted paedophile.

Police also found 533 indecent images of children and discovered Merrick had been searching on the internet for mocked up ‘pseudo’ nude images of Emma Watson, the Harry Potter actress.

At Manchester Crown Court Judge Martin Steiger QC called Merrick an ‘obsessive loner’ and added: ‘This campaign caused intense distress.

‘It escalated to be a ruthless and relentless campaign waged against local postal workers. It must have been perfectly obvious that this was a wicked thing to do. The defendant used his high intelligence and technical sophistication.’

He was found guilty of 17 counts of making indecent photographs of a child, four offences of distribution of an indecent image of a child and placing an explosive substance in a postbox with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

As well as his seven-year sentence, unemployed Merrick was told that on release he would spend another five years on licence.
