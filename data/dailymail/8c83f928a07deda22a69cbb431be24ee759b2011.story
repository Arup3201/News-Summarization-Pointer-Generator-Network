The family of the gunman who opened fire near a Texas university campus, sparking a deadly shooting spree that left three dead, have described him as 'deeply troubled' and a 'ticking time bomb'.

Divorced gun collector Thomas Alton Caffall, 35, turned a weapon on police constable Brian Bachmann, 41, when the officer arrived at his house near Texas A&M University to serve him with eviction papers.

It sparked an exchange of fire which lasted 30 minutes and left both the veteran officer - a married father of two - and the gunman dead. A third man, identified as 43-year-old Chris Northcliff, was also killed after apparently becoming caught up in the gunfire.

Three police officers and a female bystander were injured in the shooting in Fidelity Street, College Station on Monday afternoon.

'He's been very deeply troubled,' Caffall's mother Linda Weaver told the Huffington Post.

She said that her son had been having mental health 'difficulties' in the past few years.

'The minute I saw the TV I knew it was him,' she said. 'I've been that worried about him.

'We are just devastated.'

Mrs Weaver was having trouble coming to terms with the tragedy.

'If you're going to commit suicide, why take all these other people with you?'

Caffall's sister Courtney Clark said the family was 'distraught'.

'Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and this is just a senseless tragedy,' she said.

'We are just distraught by the havoc that he has caused.'

Killed: Bachmann was the elected constable for Precinct 1 in Brazos County. He was killed in the shooting on Monday, as was civilian Chris Northcliff, 43

Caffall's stepfather Richard Weaver described the 35-year-old as a 'ticking time bomb.'

'He was crazy as hell,' Mr Weaver said to Click2Houston. 'At one point, we were afraid that he was going to come up here and do something to his mother and me.'

He said that Caffall had quit his job nine months ago and said he would never work for anybody ever again.

'God loves us all. We are all capable of redemption, if we are willing to change.'

On his Facebook page, Caffall has posted multiple photographs of his weapon collection, including antique rifles and semi-automatic guns.

'No, it's not an AK. It's a Czech vz. 58. Just picked it up today, can't wait to try it out on the range. :),' he wrote as the caption to one of his gun photographs.

'I just got a new toy!' he wrote on the caption of another one.

He lists his religion as Christian and describes himself as 'a cross between Forrest Gump and Jack Kerouac (without the drugs). I'm on the road, permanently.'

'God loves us all. We are all capable of redemption, if we are willing to change,' he says.

He lists Emily Dickinson, Winston Churchill, Yoda and George Orwell quotes as some of his favorites, as well as one of his own sayings.

'If you feed the bears, they come back,' he says.

College Station Assistant Police 
Chief Scott McCollum said the city's law enforcement community had been 
left devastated by the death of elected constable Mr Bachmann.

'He was a pillar of the community and it is sad and tragic that we have lost him,' he said.

Officers lined up to salute the 
respected officer on Monday afternoon as his body was transported from 
hospital to a funeral home.

Four other people were hospitalised following the shooting spree on Monday, including a 55-year-old woman who is understood to be in a serious condition. She has not been identified.

Another police officer, Justin Oehlkee, was treated for a gunshot wound to the calf. He is in a stable condition.

Two other officers, Brad Smith and Phil Dorsett were treated for 'shrapnel injuries' before being released from hospital, police said.

Bachmann
 had approached the house, which is in a historical district of the city
 just blocks from the campus, shortly after midday, police said.

Home: The officer was visiting Caffall to serve him civil papers

Victim: An investigator uncovers a body at the scene where a gunman opened fire on a police officer serving an eviction notice near the Texas A&M University on Monday

'The officer went there to serve civil papers and that's when he was approached by the subject.,' Officer Jason James, with the Bryan police department, told the MailOnline.

Shots were fired for nearly 30 minutes in four different locations on the street, the officer told the MailOnline.

More officers arrived on the scene after reports of gunfire and found Bachmann in the front garden. They tried to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead at an area hospital, Asst Chief McCollum said.

The new officers approached the suspected gunman and eventually shot him and took him into custody, police told the MailOnline. He later died of his injuries.

The fatal shooting is the third in 
recent weeks, following from a horrific gun attack in Aurora, Colorado, 
last month where 12 people were shot dead as they watched the new Batman
 movie.

And just last week, six people were gunned down by a neo-Nazi white supremacist as they attended a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.

The Texas A&M University had issued a warning on its website of an 'active shooter' near the campus football stadium, Kyle Field, at 12.30 p.m.

Anger: Bachmann attended the home of the shooter in College Station to serve him with eviction papers

Shock: A woman reacts outside of the College Station Medical Center, where five victims were brought

At 12.44, the university issued a statement saying the shooter had been taken into custody, but warned people to remain inside.

'The scene is reportedly under control and there is no longer a danger to the public,' KBTX reported.

Texas
 A&M is the sixth biggest university in the country, but few 
students were on campus as classes for the fall semester begin later 
this month.

'It appeared to be fairly quiet,' Texas A&M spokeswoman Sherylon Carroll said of campus. 'It didn't appear to be a lot of people out and about at that particular time.'

Some students may have been on campus for final 
grades, which came out at midday, according to the A&M calendar.

Fears: The gunman is believed to have fired from a house in the historic district, just blocks from the campus

Grim discovery: When police officers arrived at the house after neighbours reported hearing gunfire, they found Bachmann lying in the front garden. The area was cordoned off by police

Injuries: Four injured people were taken to hospital, while three - including the gunman - were killed by gunfire

Barbara
 Murphy, 84, who lives near Fidelity Drive, told the New York Times she 
heard about six or eight gunshots at around 12:30. About 15 minutes 
later, she heard another round of gunshots, she said.

'We’re
 doing a lot of remodeling around here, but then I realized it couldn’t 
just be a hammer,' she said. 'About that time a neighbor called and said
 don’t go outside.'

College Station lies about 90 miles northwest of Houston.

Diana Harbourt, 27, whose house is about a block from the scene of the deadly shooting, said she had just come home for lunch when she and her boyfriend heard five loud popping sounds.

'I just thought it was somebody moving wood or stacking something,' she said.

'Then we heard more sirens and more officers and fire trucks came and they were keeping their distance, kind of slowly moving in. More officers showed up and told us to stay inside.

'The fear didn't hit me until after the fact, especially when I found a bullet hole in front of my house.'
