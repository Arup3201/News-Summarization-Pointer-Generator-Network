Two of the BBC’s top executives have claimed salary cuts cannot go much further…despite the fact they are paid a combined £690,000-a-year.

Strategy chief James Purnell, who earns £295,000, and finance director Anne Bulford, on £395,000, were accused of ‘scare tactics’ as they threatened to slash the programming budget to save more money.

Miss Bulford said ‘tough choices’ would have to be made over which services are cut as further belt-tightening in pay, staff numbers and the property portfolio is impossible.

Meanwhile Mr Purnell – who is a former Labour cabinet minister – refused to rule out the closure of another TV channel such as arts station BBC4 to save cash.

But Tory MP Philip Davies claimed yesterday there was ‘plenty more fat to be cut from the BBC’s bloated management’ and accused them of trying to frighten viewers into supporting an increase in the licence fee.

He said: ‘This is a scare tactic to get public support for the BBC budget. This has Purnell’s fingerprints all over it. It used to be a standard Labour party tactic to cut essential services rather than salaries.

‘Then they complain about how hard the cuts are affecting ordinary people, while holding on to their own pay deals. I just hope the Government and the public don’t fall for it. This reminds me of the dark arts of the Tony Blair spin years.’

Miss Bulford published a report entitled Driving Efficiency At The BBC in which she said the corporation had made £1.1billion in annual savings since 2007, but needs to find an extra £400million a year by 2017.

She argued that most of the savings made so far were ‘structural or one-off opportunities’, including a reduction in staff numbers, property sales, and ‘pay restraint’.

She insisted that by reducing senior manager numbers and pay, the BBC had saved £20million a year, but argued that ‘the BBC’s ability to deliver efficiencies in the same scale is reducing’.

As a result, Miss Bulford said ‘touch choices’ would have to be made, raising fears the BBC will cut more services rather than slim down its management further.

Director general Tony Hall – who earns £450,000 a year - has already announced plans to axe youth channel BBC3, but it is thought BBC4 could be the next to go

Thirteen of the BBC’s most senior directors – who control its news, radio and TV channels – are paid a combined £3.6million.

Director general Tony Hall – who earns £450,000 a year - has already announced plans to axe youth channel BBC3, but it is thought BBC4 could be the next to go.

Interviewed on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Purnell refused to rule out scrapping the arts station, saying only: ‘We’re not announcing anything about BBC4 today.

‘We don’t want to close BBC4. What we are doing is making efficiency savings…we’re saving as much money as we possibly can.’

In her report, Miss Bulford complained that although the £145.50 licence fee has remained the same since 2010, the BCB has seen its real terms funding had decreased by 26 per cent because of inflation and increased obligations, such as the need to fund broadband rollout.

But John O’Connell, Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The BBC should be doing what it can to save money and cut frivolous services that don’t adhere to its public service commitment. 

‘Asking for more money through the licence fee is simply not an option when families are already paying a pretty penny for a dying model of broadcasting.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC is making significant management savings - executive director pay is discounted by 50 to 80 per cent against the commercial sector saving in excess of £2.5m per year.

‘Since 2009, the BBC has reduced the number and pay bill of senior managers by more than a third, reducing the pay bill by over £20m per year.

‘Overall, pay restraint, combined with headcount reductions, has saved the BBC over £150m per year.’
