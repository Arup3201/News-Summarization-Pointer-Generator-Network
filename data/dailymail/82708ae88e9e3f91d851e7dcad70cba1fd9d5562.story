He seemed like an ordinary suburban man and father of four, but Ali Reza Sonmez was abducted and murdered in an execution style killing and his body dumped in a river across a state border.

NSW Police are now acting on the possibility that 44-year-old Sonmez may have had a secret, dark past, and  have travelled to South Australia to investigate the posting of a mysterious letter interstate.

It is almost 28 years since the disappearance of Sonmez, a disabled pensioner of Turkish descent who lived quietly with his family in Mildura, Victoria.

Mr Sonmez left his home at around 5pm on January 23, 1986. Witnesses saw him walking along the footpath of Ninth St, Mildura, past the Mobil service station.

Gangland killing: Ali Sonmez was abducted and murdered execution style in January 1986, and the killing of this father-of-four has confounded police for nearly three decades

Lonely spot: Turkish-born Ali Sonmez, 44, disappeared off a street in Merbein, Victoria and his bullet-ridden body was found by fishermen at a lonely spot on the Darling River (pictured) three days later

Do you know this man: Police released this snapshot (above) of this as yet unidentified man who is possibly of Turkish descent. The photo was found in the glove box of murdered Ali Sonmez's car following his murder

About 90 minutes later, Mr Sonmez was seen 11km away, outside the post office in Merbein, a tiny town  northwest of Mildura on the banks of the Murray River. A witness saw him argue with a man who was standing on the street with two women.

No further known sightings were reported of Mr Sonmez alive. On the afternoon of January 25, 1986 Mr Sonmez's family reported him missing and the following morning, on Australia Day, fishermen on the Darling River 20km north of the NSW border town of Wentworth discovered a body snagged in the water.

When forensic police examined it, they found several bullet holes.

Ali Sonmez had been shot above each eye, in the back of the head and sustained other bullet wounds.  His body was floating off a river bank 50km from where he was last seen arguing on the street in Merbein.

At the time, police said Mr Somnez had been abducted by someone he possibly knew, taken interstate and his body dumped.

Com-fit pictures were made of the three people with whom Mr Sonmez was last seen outside the Merbein post office.

Mr Sonmez was described as a  family man, who helped people in trouble. Following his detah, his wife and four children, on e of whom was disabled, left Mildura and the case remained unsolved, with detectives saying they did not believe Mr Sonmez had any gangland connections.

In 2008, NSW Police formed Strike Force Pender to investigate the murder with the assistance of detectives from South Australia and Victoria, making inquiries within Turkish communities in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.

A $100,000 reward for information relating to Mr Sonmez's shooting death was posted. Last year, police released a snapshot of a man which they had found in the glovebox of Mr Sonmez's car. The man looked to be of middle-eastern, possibly Turkish descent.

They also released an artist's impression of a vehicle the three people Mr Sonmez was seen with in Merbein were believed to have been travelling in at the time.

Strike Force detectives from New South Wales have now travelled to South Australia, after an anonymous letter about the case arrived at Adelaide's Major Crime Investigation Branch.

The letter was posted in South Australia and  contains 'credible new information' about Mr Sonmez's murder.

Anyone with information to assist police should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
