Victim: Matthew Shepard was a 21-year-old college student when he was beaten and left to die in Laramie, Wyoming in October 1998

New claims have been made about the murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard in 1998 saying that his death was not actually a hate crime like it has so often described.

Journalist Stephen Jimenez claims that Shepard was pistol whipped, beaten and tortured before being tied to a fence and left to die not because he was gay but because his attackers were high on meth and wanted to take his money.

Attackers Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were both given life sentences and spoke out in 2004 saying that they had been on methamphetamine fore days before the October 6, 1998 beating in Laramie, Wyoming but gay rights activists have blasted the book for being an attempt at re-writing history.

Jimenez maintains that over the course of more than 100 interviews with people with connections to the case he discovered that Shepard was made into a gay rights martyr after the fact.

He claims to have found a previously-sealed letter in the court filings on the case where a local male hustler wrote that Aaron McKinney  'really did like having sex with gay guys, that he wasn't unfamiliar with homosexuality and the gay world'.

If that claim is true, it would dent the argument that the beating death was based around the attacker's fear of homosexuality.

In earlier interviews, Jimenez says that 
McKinney and Henderson believed that Shepard was going to trade them 
drugs in return for sex and that they decided to rob him.

New theory: Now journalist Stephen Jimenez (left), who is gay himself, has written a book claiming that Shepard was killed because the two attackers were high on meth and wanted to rob him

Though he told FoxNews that he maintained 'rigorous journalistic standards' during the investigation, this is not the first time that Jimenez has caused controversy on this topic.

Left-leaning site Media Matters said that Jimenez initially prompted outrage when he produced a news segment for 20/20 where he interviewed McKinney who said that the attack was fuelled by his recent meth binge.

'Sometimes when you have that rage going through you, there’s no stopping it,' McKinney said during that interview.

'All I wanted to do was beat him up and rob him … Seemed like a good idea at the time.'

The press release accompanying the book painted Jimenez as an unbiased journalist, saying that 'his aim was to write a screenplay on what he, and the rest of the nation, believed to be an open-and-shut case of bigoted violence,' going on to mention that 'as a gay man, he felt an added moral imperative to tell Matthew’s story'.

Controversial: The case garnered national attention because of the belief that the murder was caused by homophobia, but now this new book claims to debunk that theory

National action: President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard Act into law in 2009 which made hate crimes a federal issue

One key connection that was left out is that Jimenez is a friend of attacker Russell Henderson's defense attorney, Tim Newcomb.

The death of Matthew Shepard- who was found in a coma after being left on the fence for 18 hours and subsequently pronounced dead six days later- was a major turning point for gay rights and hate crimes prosecution across the country.

In 2009 President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law, making it a federal crime to attack someone based on their actual or perceived gender or sexual orientation.

The Matthew Shepard Foundation has blasted all of the assertions in Jimenez’s book, writing them off as ‘innuendo, rumor or conspiracy theories’.

'Attempts now to rewrite the story of this hate crime appear to be based on untrustworthy sources, factual errors, rumors and innuendo rather than the actual evidence gathered by law enforcement and presented in a court of law,' the group said through a statement.
