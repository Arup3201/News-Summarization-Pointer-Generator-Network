Expelled: Lewis McLeod was expelled following an investigation into an alleged sexual assault but he never was subject to a criminal investigation

A soccer player who was expelled from Duke University because he was accused of sexually assaulting another student is now suing the school to get his diploma.

Lewis McLeod was accused of sexually assaulting a female student in November and though the school expelled him after conducting his own investigation, the case was never pursued by law enforcement and he never faced criminal charges.

McLeod, who is Australian and in North Carolina on a student visa, has filed a lawsuit saying that without the diploma that he was originally due to receive earlier this month, his life is being put on a detrimental hold.

Local station WRAL reports that the lawsuit claims that the 'sloppy investigation' and 'violated Duke University's own written standards... as well as all notions of fundamental fairness'.

If the expulsion is not overturned, McLeod will lose his student status and be forced to return to Australia.

If he does not receive the degree, he will also lose a conditional job offer at an unspecified Wall Street firm.Â 

Scene: McLeod says that the sex he had at his home (pictured) with the young woman he met at a bar in November 2013 was consensual but she claims she was assaulted

'Inability to actually assume employment 
in this prestigious position is substantially certain to negatively 
impact him forevermore,' his lawyers wrote.

The alleged sexual assault took place 
on November 14 when McLeod, who played on the school's soccer team, 
brought a young woman home from a local Durham, North Carolina bar.

They
 proceeded to have sex, and though he claims it was consensual, the 
unidentified young woman 'got emotional' and started crying.

She later contacted the local police and the school's police force. Duke's Office of Student Conduct conducted an investigation though it remains unclear why the local police did not pursue any charges.

'Throughout the hearing, members of the panel and the Office of Student Conduct made decisions that prevented Mr. McLeod from presenting his side of the story, denied him his right to respond to allegations against him and denied him his right to a fair and impartial hearing,' his attorneys wrote.

Duke University has a very public history of controversy surrounding sexual assault charges.

In 2006, three lacrosse players were accused of raping a stripper who had been hired to perform at a party. The scandal and subsequent trial became a national news story but the accuser was found to have fabricated the story.

The three young men have filed lawsuits against the city, and one of their lawyers is representing McLeod in his case.

'I think it's terribly unfair to impact an accused student's life, future career, even the pursuit of their degree at this level,' attorney Kerry Sutton told WRAL.

'I'm not saying rape doesn't happen. I know it happens. It's a horrific offense," but she asserted that the judgement and punishment should be handed out by law enforcement and not universities.
