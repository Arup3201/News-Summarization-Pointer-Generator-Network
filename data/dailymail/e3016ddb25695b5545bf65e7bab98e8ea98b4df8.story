This is the bizarre moment a horse was captured on CCTV wandering into a police station.

The brown and white stallion strolled through two sets of automatic doors at Cheshire Police Headquarters in the early hours on Monday.

The force yesterday released CCTV footage of the moment a civilian police worker challenged the animal as it came into the reception area.

A civilian police worker attempted to challenge the animal as it entered reception area to no avail 

Police later discovered the horse had broken loose from a field near the police headquarters in Winsford, Cheshire, and trotted into the station.

A police spokesperson said: 'The constabulary encourages contact from a wide variety of different communities and an interesting visitor recently stepped through the doors of its HQ from a very rural community.

'Security staff at HQ were quick off the mark to greet a horse that had decided to investigate the HQ.

'The horse was monitored entering the grounds and was safety escorted off the premises returning it to official residence.'

'We like to ensure a warm welcome to all our guests at HQ and at 'neigh' point did the horse pose a risk to security.'
