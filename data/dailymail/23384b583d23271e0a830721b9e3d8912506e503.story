A Pennsylvania newlywed couple who lured a stranger to his death through a Craigslist ad were sentenced to life without parole Thursday. 

Addressing Miranda and Elytte Barbour in court, a judge said they must be permanently removed from society.

Neither defendant displayed any emotion Thursday in Northumberland County Court in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, as the victims' relatives expressed anger and pain over the slaying.

Their fate is sealed: Elytte Barbour, 22, and his wife, Miranda, 19 (pictured outside court Thursday) have been sentenced to life without parole for luring a stranger to his death through a Craigslist ad

Slain: Troy LaFerrara, 42, was stabbed 20 times by Miranda Barbour while her husband choked him with a cord 

However, Elytte Barbour, 22, apologized, but said he could not explain his actions.

The defendant appeared in court with what appeared to be a new teardrop tattoo on his right cheek - a symbol often used by criminals to signify that they had killed someone.    

They pleaded guilty last month to second-degree murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence, in a plea deal that ruled out the death penalty.

Troy LaFerrara was answering an ad offering companionship when he was attacked in 19-year-old Miranda Barbour's vehicle November 11. 

Police say she stabbed him 20 times while her husband held a cord around his neck.

The sentencing comes three weeks after the Barbours pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the November slaying of Troy LaFerrara.

Notorious: Miranda Barbour boasted in April about killing at least 22 other people during her involvement with a satanic cult 

The couple married in North Carolina and moved to central Pennsylvania about three weeks before they met up with the victim, Troy LaFerrara, when he accepted her offer of companionship on Craigslist in exchange for money.

Miranda Barbour picked up LaFerrara at a mall in Selinsgrove on November 11 and drove in her car to Sunbury, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia.

After they parked, Elytte Barbour came out of his hiding place under a blanket in the back seat and held a cord tight against LaFerrara's neck while his petite wife stabbed the 6-foot-2, 278-pound man about 20 times. They dumped his body in an alley.

Elytte Barbour later told police the couple killed LaFerrara, 42, because they wanted to kill someone together.

Miranda Barbour initially denied knowing LaFerrara, who was from Trevorton, but changed her story when police gathered records that showed the last call to his cellphone came from hers, authorities said.

Elytte Barbour admitted his involvement a few days later after police obtained video surveillance recordings that showed him getting out of her car on the night of the killing and buying supplies to clean it.

In April, Miranda gained fleeting national notoriety when she said in an interview with Sunbury's The Daily Item newspaper that she had killed at least 22 other people in Alaska, Texas, North Carolina and California over six years as part of her involvement in a satanic cult. But checks by police failed to substantiate her claims.

At a court hearing last month, LaFerrara's widow wept as the judge questioned Miranda Barbour about her plea. His sister, Holly LaFerrara, said the family was satisfied with the double plea deal.

In an interview from Muncy State Prison in August, the 19-year-old, who has a young son, told the newspaper she believes she belongs behind bars.

‘I don't want to hurt anyone else,’ she said at the time.

When asked during her sentencing Thursday is she wanted to address the court, the 19-year-old mother of one simply said: 'no.'  

Her husband, however, appeared contirte and begged forgiveness for his role in the bloody slaying, reported The Daily Item.

'There are no words to say how sorry I am for committing this act,' said Barbour. 'I wish I knew what was running through my head that night. 

'I don’t know if I ever will know and if I could go back I know I would not have done this.

'I regret taking this man from his home. I hope they can find it in their heart to forgive me for my sins.'
