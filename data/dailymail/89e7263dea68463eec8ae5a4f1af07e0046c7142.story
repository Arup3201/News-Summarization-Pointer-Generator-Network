This is the dramatic moment a jealous boyfriend returned to a bar with his friends and attacked two men with machetes, guns and grenades - for chatting to his girlfriend. 

Unsuspecting pair Chen Hou, 35 and Hui Chang, 29, chatted to the girl sitting by herself at a bar in the city of Leizhou, China.

But moments later, three armed men - one of whom police said was the woman's boyfriends - stormed in and launched a savage assault.

Chen Hou, 35 and Hui Chang, 29, were chatting to the girl at a bar when her boyfriend burst in wielding a gun

They used barstools to try and defend themselves, as the girl made a quick dash for the exit 

In the shocking footage, one of the men wearing a cap bursts in to the bar pointing a gun at the defenceless duo. 

The woman is spotted making a quick dash for the exit as the violence escalates. 

The victims are then seen cowering behind a wooden stool as the three attackers try to slash and stab them with the machete. 

The men then manage to stagger out on the street, but are set upon again with one of the assailants booting one of the victim's heads. 

Badly injured from stab wounds, kicks and punches, the two men ran off but the attackers were not finished.  

What appears to be a grenade was then thrown in their direction, exploding with a bright flash.

Hui suffered deep wounds and was taken to hospital along with his friend.

Once outside, the attackers continue with their brutal assault slashing at the men with a machete

The attackers also aimed kicks at the defenceless man's head as he lay helpless on the ground

Doctor Lu Liuzhong said the pair had a lucky escape as the weapon had been razor sharp

Chen said: 'They also had a gun and we had nothing, and all we could do was pick up a bar stool and try and hide behind it as they threatened us with the gun and took wild stabs with the machete.' 

Doctor Lu Liuzhong said the pair had a lucky escape as the weapon had been razor sharp and the attackers were intent on causing serious injuries. 

Police are now hunting the attackers.
