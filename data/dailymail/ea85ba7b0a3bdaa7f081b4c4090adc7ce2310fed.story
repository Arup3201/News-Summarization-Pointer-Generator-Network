A 500lb fireball lit up the sky as it soared over new York, Pennsylvania and Ohio on Tuesday.

The meteor was captured on video hurtling at 45,000 miles per hour by three NASA surveillance cameras at around 4.45am EST on February 17.

It was first detected flying at 60 miles above ground, and last seen at 13 miles over Kittanin. 

Posting an animated graphic of the meteor's journey on Facebook, the agency said: 'This celestial visitor had an orbit that took it out to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - it came a mightly long way to a fiery end in the predawn Pennsylvania sky.'

Excited witnesses commented on the post, regaling their sightings.
