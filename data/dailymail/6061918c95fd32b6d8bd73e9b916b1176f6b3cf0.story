The emotional moment a U.S. Air Force captain, who had been serving in Afghanistan for six months, surprised his wife by sneaking up on her while wearing scuba gear, has been captured on film.

The woman had been filming a video message for her husband, who she believed she would have to wait another three weeks to see.

But, as Bethany Bronson and her children recorded messages for Captain Hyrum Bronson while they snorkeled near their home in Okinawa, Japan, yesterday, she had no idea she was standing just a few feet away from him.

Watch Captain Bronson surprise his family:

The air force physician, who had been away 
for six months, had put on scuba gear so he could sneak up on his family
 and surprise them during a family day out, after returning home three weeks early.

Just before he made his unexpected entrance, which was filmed and posted on LiveLeak, a family friend filming Mrs Bronson and her children, had asked her children to record a message to send to their daddy in Afghanistan.

Daughter Charity had said: 'I will love him for always,' before the cameraman turned to Mrs Bronson and asked what she would like to tell her husband.

'I love you and miss you,' she answered, before joking 'I want your body.'

As she continued to swim with her 
youngest daughter, her husband, wearing camouflage uniform and scuba 
gear, suddenly emerged from the water behind her.

Homecoming: Captain Bronson and his wife embrace in the water, near their home on an air base in Japan

'Mrs Bronson, your husband's here, reporting for duty,' he said, as their children rushed to hug him.

At first his wife was so shocked she stayed where she was in the water, crying, before finally giving her husband a hug and kissing him.

Captain Bronson, who serves on Kadena Air Base in Japan, had been away from his family for about six months.
