Roy Hodgson has been confirmed as the new England football manager after signing a four-year deal.

Hodgson will perform a dual role with his club side West Bromwich Albion and England until the end of the season, planning for England's Euro 2012 campaign, while overseeing the Baggies' final two games against Bolton and Arsenal.

The 64-year-old's first game in charge of his country will be against Norway on May 26.

Congratulations: Newly appointed England manager Roy Hodgson, right shakes hands with FA chairman David Bernstein at the press conference today

Speaking at an FA press conference today, he said: 'It is a very proud 
day for me, I'm a very happy man to be offered the chance to manage my 
country.

'I'm looking forward to the task 
ahead. Everyone knows it is not an easy one but I'm hoping that 
everyone, fans and supporters will get behind the team.

'It's the team that counts, they go out and win football matches.
"What I'll do is try to make sure the team is well prepared for the challenge ahead.

'I'm really looking forward to it.'

Hodgson acknowledged he did not have 
much time to settle into the job before Euro 2012 but said: 'It's going 
to be difficult of course but hopefully I've got time. Obviously I've 
been working here for the last five years so the players are pretty well
known to me even though I haven't worked with them all.
"I've done as much research and spoken to as many people as I can.'

Hodgson preferred not to answer 
questions about picking John Terry and Rio Ferdinand in his squad, or 
the possibility of selecting Steven Gerrard as captain, but was 
forthcoming about the prospect of Wayne Rooney going to Ukraine and 
Poland.

Rooney is suspended for England's 
opening two games, but Hodgson appeared to put to bed any debate about 
whether the Manchester United striker would be part of the final squad 
or not.

'I'm looking 
forward to Wayne Rooney coming to the Euros with us and making a 
contribution even though he cannot play the first two games,' he said.

Asked about England's prospects at the Euros, Hodgson added: 'England always have to go in tournaments to win them because we are a major football nation. I certainly think the players would be very disappointed if we expected anything less of them than to win the tournament.'

Hodgson also confirmed he is set to wait until after the end of the Barclays Premier League season on May 13 before naming his squad for the European Championships.

He said: 't's going to be very important after this press conference to get straight down to the task, making certain that when the time comes to name the squad, which we are likely to put back as a matter of fact until after the last game of the season, that I've done as much research as I can and spoken to as many players as I can.'

Earlier, the FA said in a statement: 'The Football Association is delighted to announce the appointment of Roy Hodgson as England manager.

Hodgson attended a four-hour meeting 
yesterday when he met all four members of the Club England board 
responsible for appointing Fabio Capello's successor.

Although the meeting broke up just 
after 7pm without any official statement, discussions were described as 
positive and Hodgson was pictured leaving Wembley with an itinerary for 
Euro 2012.

West Brom are now stepping up their search to find a new manager after Hodgson opted to end his 15-month spell in charge.

Baggies chairman Jeremy Peace said: 
'Roy's appointment as England manager is obviously disappointing news 
for the club as we would have liked him to sign a new contract, which 
was in the process of negotiation, and remain as our head coach.

'But we understand Roy's desire to 
take the England job and he will leave us after the Arsenal game on May 
13 with our best wishes.

'Of course, with Euro 2012 around the
corner, we appreciate that some of Roy's focus over the next 12 days 
will be on England matters.

'But we are delighted he will be seeing the season out with us.

'With the help of the coaching staff,
he will prepare the team in his usual, meticulous manner as we finish 
what has already been a successful season.'

Peace added: 'The board will now 
concentrate on the important task of appointing a new head coach to 
continue our project as we prepare for a third successive season in the 
Barclays Premier League.

'We did not want Roy to leave and he will be a tough act to follow.

'But I want to reassure our 
supporters that we will do everything possible to identify and appoint 
the right head coach for this football club.

'I would also like to thank the FA 
Chairman, David Bernstein, for the sensitive and professional manner in 
which he has liaised with me in bringing about Roy's appointment.

'Everyone here would like to wish Roy, The FA and England all the best for Euro 2012 and beyond.'
