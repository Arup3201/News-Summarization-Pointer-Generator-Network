A 13-year-old girl, who had pioneering artificial heart surgery which caused her to carry a battery for her heart pump in a purse wired to her chest, has successfully received a heart transplant.

Kyah DeSimone from Hyannis, Massachusetts, received the long-awaited transplant on Saturday.

She was previously kept alive with a heart pump powered by a battery she carried in her purse.

Such treatment wasn't permitted on 
children until Kyah's case emerged but now she will finally be able to 
put the purse away after a donor heart was found.

'We've been waiting for it,' her 
mother Danielle DeSimone told Cape Cod Online. 'We always knew we could 
get the call any moment. (The doctor) told me they think they found the 
perfect match for Kyah.'

She is now recovering at Boston's Children's Hospital and was in a stable condition, according to her mother.

Mail Online first reported Kyah's story last month.

She was
rushed to hospital from a sleepover when she was just 10 years old. 
Doctors were shocked to realize she was suffering from heart failure as a
result of dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition that slowly means the 
heart is too weak to pump.

Doctors had to fight to win the teen a titanium pump - surgically implanted into her chest and powered by a small portable battery.

At the time, the small metal device wasn't approved for children but doctors asked for an emergency exemption, saying they had no choice.

Dr. Christina VanderPluym, a pediatric cardiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, said: 'In the past, we would just allow these kids to pass peacefully. But now we have ventricular assist devices small enough to put in children, and that's what we were able to use in Kyah.'

Emergency: Kyah DeSimone was rushed to hospital from a sleepover after suffering heart failure at the age of 10. She is pictured with her mom Danielle, right.

'We had to ask for an emergency exemption. It took a lot of work by lot of different people to make this happen.'

Kyah's bag contained a battery pack and iPod sized monitor which connected to the pump through a wire in her abdomen.

Her frantic mother, a nurse, spoke about her daughter's first attack.

'I knew it was heart failure when I saw it,' she told ABC News. 'We didn't know if she would make it through the night," she said. 'It was the worst thing to watch, ever.'

'I can feel it inside, vibrating,' Kyah said previously. 'It's very noisy. It's a little nerve-racking.'

The
pump or Heartware Ventricular System - was approved for use 
in children by the FDA just nine days after Kyah's implant was approved.
