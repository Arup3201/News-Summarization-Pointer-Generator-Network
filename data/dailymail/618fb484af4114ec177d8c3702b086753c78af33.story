'There's a car park in every pub you go to': Arthur Kibble stands by his product

Campaigners are calling for pills which allow drivers to drink five pints of beer and still pass a breathalyser test to be banned after a businessman began selling them in the UK.

Arthur Kibble, 64, boasts the 'Alcopal' capsules allow motorists to drink until they are over the limit, yet still give a breath test which is nine times lower than it
should be.

Kibble, from Birmingham, is selling the pills online and said he is not advocating drinking and driving.

The pills have already been withdrawn in America but they are legally on
sale in Britain - where 280 people die on average each year as a result
of drink driving.

Last week The Department of Transport revealed that the number of drink 
driving deaths had risen by 12 per cent - the first increase in over a 
decade.

The pills, which
are taken before and after a drinking session, are said to prevent 
alcohol being absorbed through the stomach and into the bloodstream.

Kibble
sells the pills online via his website and said he had tested them 
himself on Home Office-approved Draegar Breathalyser machines.

Today,
the defiant businessman denied that he was encouraging motorists to 
drink and drive, and said the pills were completely safe.

He
said: 'The pills work by preventing the absorption of alcohol from the 
inner lining of the stomach and the intestine into the bloodstream.

'All of the ingredients are natural, there’s no prescription stuff in there.'

Kibble has tested the pulls himself and says they reduce a breathalyser reading nine times lower than expected

Mr Kibble claims the tablets prevent the absorption of alcohol into the blood stream, and that scientists then noted this affected blood alcohol readings taken in a breath test.

The Mail Online has been able to locate the source of the tablets, but Kibble insists they are well-known in the pharmaceutical business.

He said: 'They were tried initially in the USA but were withdrawn after pressure on the drug firms.

'The pharmaceutical industry spent millions on the research but decided not to go ahead with mass production.'

If the tablets do stop alcohol being absorbed, then this will reduce the effect of alcohol on the user.

Kibble added that a pharmacist involved in the research had continued to 
produce the tablets, said to be made of herbal extract and carbon, for 
sale in the UK.

He added: 'I am not advocating that motorists get blind drunk and then try to drive, but it does help you mentally.

'Because it prevents the uptake of alcohol and gives some protection to your liver and kidneys you’re more in control.

'I have had my lawyers check them out and they are perfectly safe and legal, otherwise I would not be selling them.

'They are targeted at anyone, especially those people who have two pints and are then banned for 12 months.

'What about bus drivers and taxi drivers who want to have a pint before work?

'Everyone does it, there’s a car park in every pub you go to.'

The legal limit for driving is 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath.

Mr Kibble claims the Alcopal pills can reduce this reading to just 4mcg per 100ml.

His website says: 'Going out to celebrate or just having a good time. Be careful if your (sic) driving. Always take ALCO-PAL with you.

'Take the recommended dose and it will make all the difference if your breathalysed ALCO-PAL helps to reduce the alcohol breath you expel from your lungs.'

Next to the product description is a link where shoppers can buy a pack of the red capsules - produced in India - for just £20 plus £3 postage.

Road safety anger

Road safety campaigners said the pills - which are being legally sold on the internet - are 'dangerous and stupid.'

Kevin
Clinton, road safety spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Accidents (RoSPA) demanded the pills were outlawed.

He said: 'It is dangerous and stupid and may encourage people to drink and drive in the belief they can get away with it.

'Drinking
and driving kills hundreds of people every year in the UK and we would 
urge people to ignore this product and those selling it to stop doing so
immediately.'

Police today called for drivers not to drink any alcohol before driving.

Chief
Insp Chris Edwards, of West Midlands Police’s traffic unit, said: 'A 
breath test at the roadside is just one of a broad range of tools 
available to officers to provide an indication that a driver may be in 
excess of the drink-drive limit.

'Everyone
reacts differently to alcohol and it’s hard to tell whether or not 
you’re over the limit, so our message to drivers is clear: it’s best not
to drink at all before driving.

'If you’re driving while over the limit, we will catch you.'
