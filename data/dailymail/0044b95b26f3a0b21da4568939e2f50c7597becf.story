These are the wild Mustangs of Manych - who have been marooned on Russia's Vodny island for 60 years.

The beautiful horses were cut off from the mainland when a canal was built in 1953.

They had originally been tame, but after getting a taste of freedom the herd has now become too feral to corral again.

They have since bred into a huge herd, believed to be the largest and longest lived wild population in Russia.

These are the wild Mustangs of Manych - who have been all but forgotten after becoming marooned on Russia's Vodny island for 60 years

They are known as the wild horses of Vodny Island. The beautiful horses were cut off from the mainland when a canal was built in 1953

These photographs were captured by Russian wildlife photographer Igor Shpilenok, 52, who described them as 'truly impressive'

He said watching them was like watching bears, adding: 'especially now, in springtime, when blood full of equine passion courses through their veins'

These photographs were captured by Russian wildlife photographer Igor Shpilenok, 52, who described them as 'truly impressive'.

He said: 'I've been around horses my whole life. But the wild horses I had the opportunity to observe in the Rostov Nature Reserve in the southern part of European Russia are a completely different story.

'Observing them is no less interesting than watching wild bears in Kamchatka, especially now, in springtime, when blood full of equine passion courses through their veins.'

Vodny Island - which translates as 'Water Island' - is surrounded by the saline waters of the Manych-Gudilo Reservoir. 

It is the largest Island in the Manych-Gudilo Reservoir, at 12km long and up to 3.5km wide, and has not a single tree or bush.

It formed in 1953, when construction of the Nevinnomysky Canal transformed the depth of the Manych River.

Before the Rostov Nature Reserve was created in 1995, the population of wild horses was relatively small, hovering around just a few dozen

Mr Shpilenok added: 'Over time the horses developed an innate fear of humans and machinery due to periodic attempts to catch them or shoot them for meat

'The herd didn't allow people to come closer than a kilometre. The alpha stallion would run out to face an intruder, pawing his hooves aggressively, quelling any visitor's desire to approach'

Before
the Rostov Nature Reserve was created in 1995, the population of wild 
horses was relatively small, hovering around just a few dozen.

Mr
Shpilenok added: 'Over time the horses developed an innate fear of 
humans and machinery due to periodic attempts to catch them or shoot 
them for meat.

'The horses
adapted to living on their own in the dry steppe, feeding on natural 
grasses year-round and surviving without shelter.

'In 1995, the Rostov Nature Reserve was created, including Vodny Island. The reserve rangers halted poaching of horses for meat.

'In the first few years of the reserve's existence, the horses remained wary of humans. During my first trip to Rostov Nature Reserve in 1999 I couldn't even get close enough to photograph the wild animals.

Nature staff have installed a 500m pipe from the mainland to provide fresh water to the horses. The herd grew to over 400 in 2006 but more than half of them were wiped out during a particularly harsh winter in 2009
