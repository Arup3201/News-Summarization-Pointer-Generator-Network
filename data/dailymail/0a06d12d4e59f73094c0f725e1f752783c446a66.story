Colombia stars including James Rodriguez and Juan Cuadrado made the most of Friday night's friendly in London by sticking around to watch the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena.

The South Americans beat the USA 2-1 at Craven Cottage, with goals from Carlos Bacca and Teofilo Gutierrez sealing a come-from-behind victory after Jozy Altidore's penalty.

Some of Jo se Pekerman's side watched a similarly impressive comeback on Saturday night as Roger Federer came from a set down to beat Stanislas Wawrinka.
