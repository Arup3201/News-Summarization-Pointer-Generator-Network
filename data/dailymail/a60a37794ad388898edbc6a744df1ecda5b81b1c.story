Ken Livingstone was accused of inciting a lynch mob mentality by urging protesters to go to homes of Whitehall officials

Ken Livingstone was accused of inciting a lynch mob mentality after he urged protesters to go to the homes of Whitehall officials sent into a controversial local authority and ‘make their lives intolerable’.

The former London mayor made his call at a rally for supporters of the mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman.

Mr Livingstone told the meeting in Mile End: ‘When these commissioners turn up, find out where they live and then have a peaceful demonstration outside their homes so their neighbours know these are the kind of people who overturn a democratically elected mayor. Make their lives intolerable.’

Local government minister Kris Hopkins told The Times: ‘I am appalled at his comments which run the risk of stirring up a lynch mob mentality in Tower Hamlets ... Stupid remarks like his will only worsen tensions.’

Auditors were asked to investigate council finances and found a ‘culture of cronyism’. 

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has sent three commissioners in to monitor the council for the next three years.

Peter Golds, the Tory group leader on the council, said Mr Livingstone’s comments were ‘absolutely deplorable’ and ‘an incitement to intimidation which surely is not acceptable nowadays’.

He added: ‘This investigation is about probity - the commissioners are there to ensure that the council will be run properly and, far from scaring them off, I wish for them to do their job properly in accordance with the law.’

Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said the remarks were ‘deeply disturbing’.

‘It’s almost inciting people to the level of intimidation,’ he warned.

Labour – which distanced itself from the remarks - also faced calls to expel Mr Livingstone from the party.

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Ken Livingstone’s views do not represent the views of the Labour Party and any act of intimidation would be entirely wrong. Tower Hamlets council must now work with the commissioners to ensure that what has gone wrong is put right.’
