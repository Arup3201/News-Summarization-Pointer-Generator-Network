Ed Miliband yesterday said he had never taken illegal drugs – but added that he had ‘read about’ the effects of cannabis.

The Labour leader said he was opposed to the decriminalisation of drugs, including cannabis, warning it would send out a dangerous message to young people.

Mr Miliband was asked about his attitude towards drugs during an online question and answer Leaders Live discussion with young people, produced by Bite the Ballot with ITV News.

Ed Miliband said he had never taken illegal drugs – but added that he had ‘read about’ the effects of cannabis

Asked whether he had ever experimented with drugs, he said: ‘I have not taken drugs… but I have read about it.’

Mr Miliband said Government should ‘always be looking at the way we discourage young people from taking drugs.’

He went on: ‘I’m not in favour of decriminalisation of, for example, cannabis. 

'I think there are mental effects of cannabis that people maybe didn’t realise a decade ago.’

Mr Miliband said Labour was still finalising plans to promise a cut in university tuition fees at next year’s election. 

And he said an incoming Labour government would consider changing the law to prevent a planned 10 per cent pay rise for MPs.

He announced that 16 and 17-year-olds will be allowed to vote within a year of the next election.

Mr Miliband said the government would change the law to lower the voting age from May 2016.

Such a move – the first change in the national voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds. It comes after the voting age was lowered for the first time in the Scottish referendum in September. 

Mr Miliband said he is opposed to decriminalisation of drugs warning it sends out a'dangerous' message to young people - adding Government should ‘always be looking'  at the ways they can discourage young people

During a YouTube debate Mr Miliband said: ‘Too many young people are turning their backs on politics which is bad for our country and bad for them too.

‘That’s because too often young people don’t get a look-in with politicians who know they can’t vote - or assume that they won’t vote.

‘The measures we will introduce in our first year of government represent the greatest extension of the franchise in my lifetime.

‘But it is not enough just to give young people the right to vote. We must do everything we can to ensure they have the chance to exercise it.'

Mr Miliband, who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age, is expected to use a speech at next week’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto.

Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Liberal Democrats. 

The voting age in Britain was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has previously dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year.
