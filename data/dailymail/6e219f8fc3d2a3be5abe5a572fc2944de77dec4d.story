A Walmart worker who was headbutted by a customer has decided to press charges against the woman who assaulted her.  

Alice Keener was staffing a stand within the Texas superstore in La Porte, when a shopper Jessica Albitz ended up getting into an arugment with her.

The two women descended into a violent brawl of hair pulling and punching after the headbut.

Now Ms Keener has decided to press charges after visiting a dentist about injuries to her teeth.

Customer Jessica Albitz headbutted tax worker Alice Keener as a row descended into violence

Police said Ms. Keener originally declined to press charges, but an evaluation by a dentist determined that the headbutt knocked two of her front teeth loose.

Ms. Keener contacted Deer Park police last week to alert them she would like to press charges. Keener was able to provide medical records to police that proved her claims.

Police said they plan to file a warrant for Albitz's arrest in the coming days.

Ms Albitz claims Ms Keener, who works at a Jackson Hewitt stall within the store was rude to her and her husband the day before the fight broke out, when the couple came into the store to get their taxes prepared.

The next day, the two women got into another argument when Albitz returned to the store and that's when things turned violent.

Video footage of the brawl shows Keener react by slamming Albitz's head onto a table five times before dragging her to the floor by her hair as the two women continued to attack each other and shout.

They eventually had to be pulled apart by a male customer. 

Keener, who is larger than the slight Albitz, was later seen picking up pulled out strands of her hair from the floor.

After they were separated she can be heard to shout on the video: 'You better get her. 

'She come in messing with me. I'm at work.'

Albitz later told Click 2 Houston that she doesn't regret the fight. 

'I hope I broke her nose. I hope she has two black eyes and I hope she remembers me for the rest of her life,' she said.

Albitz said her and her husband had encountered Keener the evening before at a Jackson Hewitt kiosk and she was very rude to them both, allegedly 'talking trash' to Albitz's husband.

She told NBC: 'She came in in a bad mood and took it out on us.' 

When she returned the next day the pair started to argue when Albitz said she heard Kenner whisper an insult under her breath, as she passed the kiosk. 

Albitz says she confronted Kenner, who then chased her to the front of the Walmart, got 'right up in my face' and spat at her. 

'She spit in my face, calling my mother a (expletive). I'm sorry. I love my family and I'm going to take up for my people,' Albitz said.

She claimed Kenner spat in her face so she decided to headbutt her in retaliation for the insults and spitting 

After being headbutted Kenner was see smashing Albitz's head into a table five times as they fought 

The tax worker then dragged Albitz to the floor by her hair as the pair continued to brawl in the store 

A man had to separate the brawling women and helped Albitz to her feet from the supermarket floor 

She said she was left with a large bruise on her arm and marks on her forehead after the violent fight. 

Neither of the women were charged with a crime after the violent brawl but Kenner has been put on 'administrative leave.' 

After the incident Jackson Hewitt issued a statement which said: 'We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination or violence in any capacity.

'The tax preparer has been placed on administrative leave as we investigate this matter.'

She is also at risk of losing the full-time job she has held with the city of La Porte for the past 15 years. Her employer said  he was shocked by the video, and that they are now investigating whether she violated the city's code of conduct. 

Meanwhile, Albitz has been banned from entering the Walmart where the fight happened ever again.  

'I was willing to take the charges,' Albitz said. 'If I were to have charges taken, I would've accepted that. For the remainder of my life, I am no longer allowed to go to Walmart on Spencer Highway.'
