One Texas health clinic is accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.

At Rapid med Urgent Care Center at Highland Village in North Texas, patients can pay using Bitcon's digital dollars in addition to cash or credit cards.

CBS reports that a Bitcoin is a virtual value someone can't hold but that someone can spend and even has its own form of ATMs.

Rapid Med Urgent Care Center is at the forefront of businesses accepting the virtual form of payment

More and more businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of currency

The clinic is the first medical center in Denton County to accept a digital Bitcoin as a form of payment.

'Bitcoin is a new money.  Banks are taken away from the formula.  It allows direct transactions between the end user and the person providing the service,' said the clinic's physician's assistant Anton Appelgvitst.

Bitcoin demand is on the rise and according to the digital dollar's website, Bitcoin is 'the simplest way to exchange money at a very low cost.'

'It’s easier than a credit card.  It’s cheaper,' explains website developer Austin Heerwaggen.  'You don’t have to worry about the government.  It’s international.'

The only challenge for companies accepting Bitcoins is that many people aren't using it as a payment yet.

The clinic said that even though they accept the service, no one has used it at their clinic yet.

However, companies like the clinic believe that people will start using it soon. 

Bitcoin has their very own form of ATMs that allows users to withdraw bit coins in the form of dollars or to deposit cash to buy more Bitcoins

A clinic in San Francisco called My Doctor Medical Group also accepts Bitcoin, reports Coindesk.com.

Coindesk reports that many medical patients choose Bitcoin because they chose to keep their health visits a secret and want to ensure patient to doctor confidentiality.

The website explains that using Bitcoin is safer than using a credit card and makes people less susceptible to identity theft.

'With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost just like with physical money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to protect your privacy,' says the site.

Bitcoin is not 100 per cent anonymous and can be linked to a person's identity when they convert Bitcoin to currency.

However, for keeping health information between a patient and a doctor, Bitcoin is a useful tool.

Even though many people haven't stared using Bitcoin, businesses have started accepting it with the belief that people will use Bitcoin
