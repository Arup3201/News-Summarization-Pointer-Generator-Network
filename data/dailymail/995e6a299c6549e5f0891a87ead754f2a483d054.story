The father of a 17-year-old girl who was fatally shot at her suburban Denver high school said Wednesday that he and his wife have forgiven the killer, and urged others to do the same.

Michael Davis said at a memorial service for his daughter Claire that the killer was blinded by anger and didn't know what he was doing.

'My wife and I forgive Karl Pierson for what he did,' Davis said.

'We would ask all of you here and all of you watching to forgive Karl Pierson. He didn't know what he was doing.'

Pierson was carrying a shotgun, more than 125 shotgun shells, a machete and three homemade firebombs when he entered Arapahoe High School in Centennial on December 13.

Terror: Karl Pierson, 18, opened fire on Arapahoe High School on December 13 after entering the school through a door that should have been locked, but rarely was. He fatally injured Claire Davis before killing himself

Investigators have said that Pierson - who is believed to have targeted a teacher at the school after being dropped from the debating team - fired three rounds into the hallway and 
then two near the library before throwing an explosive at a bookshelf.

He then used a sixth shot to kill himself.

In the hallway, his second round was 
fired directly at Claire Davis, who was struck in the head.

She died from her injuries on December 21.

It has been reported that Pierson spent the morning before the shooting bowling alone.

In an eerie parallel, it was initially reported in 1999 that the two Columbine High School shooters also went bowling before opening fire, killing 13 and then themselves. This has since been disputed.

Some law enforcement officers have vowed not to use Pierson's name and have referred to him publicly as 'the murderer,' but Michael Davis was conciliatory.

'The young man that shot Claire had a name. His name was Karl Pierson,' Davis said, fighting back tears with his wife, Desiree, at his side.

Davis said Pierson 'allowed himself to become filled with anger, rage and hatred. ... The fact is that Karl was so blinded by his emotions he didn't know what he was doing.'

Davis said his daughter's last words were to ask Pierson, 'Oh my gosh, Karl, what are you doing?'

That was her way of trying to illuminate the emotional darkness that had enveloped Pierson, Davis said.

'Claire was a gift to her mother and me and although we desperately wanted to hold onto this gift, we are learning to accept the fact it was time to return the gift to the giver,' he said.

'Her influence and light is ours to keep and we will not let death take this from us.'

The school janitor was the first to sound the warning and a prompt lockdown followed due to the efforts of school resource officer James Englert and security guard Rod Mauler.

The ordeal lasted one minute and 17 seconds.

Authorities
 are still investigating reports that Pierson was targeting his debate 
coach and the librarian Tracy Murphy after the student was dropped from 
the debate team.

Pierson's parents, Barbara and Mark, 
issued a short statement via email after their son's victim's death in 
which they said that their prayers were with Claire’s family.

‘We are heartbroken to hear of 
Claire's passing. Our hearts ache for her family as they deal with 
unimaginable grief. Our prayers are with Claire's family & the 
entire Arapahoe community,’ read the statement.

Davis,
 who spent just over a week in a coma, was surrounded by her family at 
the time of her passing, according to a message posted on the hospital's Facebook page.

At the request of her family and friends, The Denver Foundation announced it had created a fund in Claire's name on Dec. 16.

The
 foundation said the Arapahoe High School Community Fund honoring Claire
 Davis will support mental health care, anti-bullying programs and other
 community needs chosen by her parents, the fund's advisers.

Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson holds a picture of Claire Davis the day after the Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo.

‘Last
 week was truly a paradox in that we lost our daughter, yet we witnessed
 the wonderful love that exists in the world through the tremendous 
outpouring of support we received,’ the Davis family said in a statement following Claire's death.

'Although we have lost our precious daughter, we will always be 
grateful for the indelible journey she took us on over the last 17 
years - we were truly blessed to be Claire’s parents.

'The grace, laughter …and light she brought to this world will not be 
extinguished by her death; to the contrary, it will only get stronger.'

Sheriff Robinson said that Claire wouldn't have had any time to run from the shooter, 
correcting earlier reports that she may have been trying to stop him.

Hundreds of Arapahoe High School students gathered for a candlelight vigil on Saturday December 14, the day after the shooting which left Claire Davis in a coma for eight days

A 
friend who was with Claire at the time dragged her to safety in a nearby
 yoga class, according to the Denver Post.

Sheriff Robinson said that Pierson had legally purchased the shotgun on December 6, a full week before the incident.

'His evil intent was to harm multiple individuals,' Sheriff Robinson said.

Arapahoe
 High School is 16 miles from the Aurora movie theater where a 
shooting occurred in June 2012 and only eight miles from Columbine High 
School, the scene of a mass school shooting in April 1999.

Around 2,230 students attend Arapahoe
 High School, which is a part of Littleton Public Schools.
