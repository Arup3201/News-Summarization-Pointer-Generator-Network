Britons driving abroad are enjoying significantly cheaper motoring at the pumps – and up to £22 less per fill-up - thanks to the strength of the pound against the weakening crisis-laden euro.

Those holidaying on European roads are saving an average of 4.2p a litre on petrol and a massive 21p a litre on diesel compared to costs at home, a survey by the AA showed.

But the biggest savings range from more than 22p a litre for petrol and nearly 32p for diesel.

Savings: An autobahn in Germany. The crisis affecting the Euro has resulted in fuel prices tumbling on the continent

For a Ford Mondeo that is a saving of £15.47 per fill-up for petrol versions and £22.26 for diesels, based on the car’s 70-litre tank.

The weaker euro is providing UK drivers on continental breaks a level of fuel saving last seen in 2008, with petrol now an average of nearly 6p a litre cheaper than in July last year.

Some of the biggest and most dramatic price drops were in France, where the cost of petrol has fallen 13.4per cent in the last 12 months – or around 20p per litre.

Petrol in France now costs 124.2p per litre and diesel 115.7p.

The AA report says the average cost of a litre of petrol in the UK is now 132.2p and diesel 137.3p.

By contrast, the cheapest petrol on the continent is in Austria where it costs just 110.1p – a saving on the UK of 22.1 per litre. That’s £15.47 less to fill up a new Ford Mondeo.

Diesel in Austria is just 105.5p – a saving of 31.8p per litre. That’s a saving of £22.26 to fill up a Mondeo.

Hard on Austria’s heels is holiday hot-spot Spain where petrol is 110.6p a litre – 21.6p cheaper than in Britain. Diesel is 105.9p a litre – 31.4p cheaper than in Britain.

Costly: Fuel prices in Britain are higher than the average for the rest of Europe

The most expensive petrol is in Holland (140.6p), although this is well down on the Dutch figure of 153.3p in July last year.

For Britons driving in the US, petrol now costs just 57.9p a litre on average, with diesel at 62.4p.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Since the beginning of July, drivers have seen the average UK pump price of petrol rise 2.53p a litre and diesel go up 2.30p.

‘At least, if they go abroad, the weaker euro allows them to claw back some of the surge from speculator-driven wholesale prices.’
