Instead of a classic car or horse-drawn carriage, one bride decided to catch a more modest form of transport to her wedding: the 10.50 train from Fazakerley in Liverpool, to be precise.

Leanne Cole, 34, hopped on board the service from her home in Fazakerley, to travel to the city centre to tie the knot. 

To make the journey that bit more romantic, the bride's railway carriage was decorated to match her wedding dress, with white balloons, peach bouquets, ribbons and glasses of champagne all brightening up the journey.

Maarten Spaargaren, Merseyrail's managing director said: 'This was certainly an unusual request, but we had a really good think about it. We came to the conclusion that with a bit of effort, it would indeed be possible for us to play a part in what we hope will be a wonderful, memorable day for Ms Cole and her new husband.'
