Vow: David Cameron will today pledge that Britain will lead a global fightback against antibiotic-resistant superbugs

David Cameron has vowed Britain will lead a global fightback against antibiotic-resistant superbugs.

The Prime Minister said concerted action was needed to prevent the world from being 'cast back into the dark ages of medicine'.

The rise of untreatable bacteria is one of the biggest health threats facing the world, threatening an 'unthinkable scenario' where minor infections could once again kill.

Tens of thousands of people are already dying of infections that have evolved resistance to common treatments.

The World Health Organisation has warned that routine operations and minor scratches could become fatal if nothing is done. 

Mr Cameron said: 'For many of us, we only know a world where infections or sicknesses can be quickly remedied by a visit to the doctor and a course of antibiotics.

'This great British discovery has kept our families safe for decades, while saving billions of lives around the world.

'But that protection is at risk as never before.

'Resistance to antibiotics is now a very real and worrying threat, as bacteria mutates to become immune to its effect.'

He warned 25,000 people in Europe already die every year from infections resistant to anti-biotic drugs.

'Tthis is not some distant threat but something happening right now', he added. 'If we fail to act, we are looking at an almost unthinkable scenario where antibiotics no longer work and we are cast back into the dark ages of medicine where treatable infections and injuries will kill once again.

'That simply cannot be allowed to happened and I want to see a stronger, more coherent global response, with nations, business and the world of science working together to up our game in the field of antibiotics.

'Following discussions at the G7 last month, I have asked the economist Jim O’Neil to work with a panel of experts and report back to me and other world leaders on how we can accelerate the discovery and development of a new generation of antibiotics.'

Mr Cameron has become the first world leader to speak out about the threat of antibacterial resistence.

It follows his stand on dementia. Last month he pledged further funding to beat the disease.

The Prime Minister believes he has the agreement of Barack Obama and Angela Merkel for co-ordinated action to find new drugs after raising the issue with them privately at a G7 summit last month.

Jim O’Neill, the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, will lead an international group of experts aiming to spur the development of a 'new generation of antibiotics'.

Issue: The Prime Minister believes he has the agreement of Barack Obama and Angela Merkel for co-ordinated action to find new drugs after raising the issue with them privately at a G7 summit last month 

Only five new types of antibiotics have been introduced since the 1960s and the supply of newly-developed drugs is dwindling as companies see little profit in working on treatments designed only to be used as a last resort.

Mr Cameron said: 'I’ve been listening to the scientific advice that I get, and the network of advisers we have are all saying this is one of the most serious health problems the world faces.

'For many of us we only know a world where infections or sicknesses can be quickly remedied by a visit to the doctor and a course of antibiotics. This great British discovery has kept our families safe for decades, while saving billions of lives around the world.

'But that protection is at risk as never before. Resistance to antibiotics is now a very real and worrying threat.' 

Professor Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said: 'We must act now on a global scale to slow down antimicrobial resistance.

'In Europe, at least 25,000 people a year already die from infections which are resistant to our drugs of last resort. New antibiotics made by the biotech and pharmaceutical industry will be central to resolving this crisis which will impact on all areas of modern medicine.

'I am delighted to see the Prime Minister taking a global lead by commissioning this review to help new antibiotics to be developed and brought to patients effectively.'
