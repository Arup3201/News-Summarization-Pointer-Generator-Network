A Colombian teenager who choked three women unconscious before sexually assaulting them in the street been bashed in the youth detention centre where he is being held.

The 18-year-old, who was 17 at the time of the attacks, was due to appear in County Court in Melbourne for sentencing on Tuesday but could not appear because of his injuries.

The court heard the teenager, who pleaded guilty earlier this year, was having surgery on his eye socket after he was bashed on November 28, The Age reported.

A teenager has pleaded guilty to three horrifically violent sexual attacks in Melbourne's CBD, on of which took place near Southern Cross Station

The 18-year-old, who targeted three strangers on separate occasions in Melbourne's CBD between November 2013 and January 2014, will be held in isolation at the centre until he can be sentenced at a later date.

The skateboarder pleaded guilty to a number of charges including rape, attempted rape, robbery, assault with intent to rape and indecent assault, The Age reported.

In each case the teen choked each victim unconscious before sexually assaulting them, sometimes multiple times, according to the prosecution.

The teenager, just 17 at the time of the attacks, was arrested on January 25 more than 200 kilometres from where the assaults took place - at camping grounds in Johanna, near Apollo Bay.

The prosecutor said the teen's family had bought him a one-way flight back to Bogota, Colombia, and had tried to assist him in altering his appearance. He had been due to leave the country the day after his arrest.

The three assaults were launched on women in their twenties between November 2013 and January 2014 at three separate locations

In the Victorian County Court earlier this year Prosecutor Dr Nanette Rogers, SC, described the terrifying nature of each of the attacks, all on young women in their early twenties.

On November 9 2013 around 12.30am the first one took place, when a 22-year-old was grabbed on Bourke Street in Melbourne's CBD and shoved in to a laneway where she was assaulted.

The second victim, a Chinese international student, 24, was speaking on the phone outside a car dealership on Kings Way near Albert street when she was attacked from behind.

She was sexually assaulted some time between 2.30 and 3am. In her victim impact statement the woman expressed her distress over the fact that such an horrific crime could happen in Australia.

'Sexual abuse is an unforgivable offence ... It should not have happened here [in Australia],' she said, according to The Age.

The Colombian teenager's third victim was another 22-year-old who according to Ms Rogers had a shard of glass held to her throat on Flinders Street around 6am on January 18.

The Colombian teen, just 17 at the time of the brazen attacks, pleaded guilty to a number of charges in the Victorian Country Court on Wednesday

Her attacker then marched her more than a kilometre through the city before dragging her into a stairway near Southern Cross Station and raping her twice, the court heard.

This victim told the court she could not escape the traumatising memories of the violent rape, and was terrified while waiting for the results to see if she had contracted HIV from her attacker.

The 22-year-old also revealed the devastating impact the incident had on her emotional connection with others, and said she no longer wanted to go to the gym as she believed the less attractive she was the less likely it was she would be assaulted again.

The case was moved from the Children's Court to the County Court because of its severity, and the fact the attacker could have faced a maximum of three years behind bars if he had been tried as a child.

The court heard the teen had moved to Australia to be with his mother late last year. He apologised for the horrific attacks but said the second two were due to alcohol abuse.

He will be sentenced at a later date, and will most likely be deported when he is released on parole.
