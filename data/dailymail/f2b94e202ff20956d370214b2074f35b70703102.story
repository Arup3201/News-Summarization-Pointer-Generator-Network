The kiss has been seen as a message to the 42 Commonwealth countries where it is a crime to be gay

The entertainer tweeted a message of thanks to his fans today - saying he was 'so happy right now' following the positive response to his kiss

His words came as Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg called the kiss a 'confident' move which emphasised the equality of Scotland.

Mr Grevemberg, who confirmed the kiss was planned, said: 'We thought this accentuated the values of Scotland and the diversity of Scotland.

'Some people may say (it was) bold, but I think confident. Gretna Green is a place where people elope.

'That moment was about people getting married. It's all about love.'

So far, the dancer who received the performer's kiss can not been named

One Twitter user spoke out in support at the embrace - saying 'every time a kiss between gay people is captured on camera, a little piece of homophobia dies'

Another user said the kiss would help gay children who faced discrimination in their home countries

Two more write their praise on the social media site - with one saying it was 'important beyond symbolism'

Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive Mike Hooper said: 'There should be no discrimination on any grounds whatsoever.

'I thought the whole thing was a fantastic show.'

Mr Grevemberg said the ceremony had been universally well-received by the athletes.

'I really hope it expressed the warmth of Glasgow and Scotland's welcome,' he said.

'The feedback that we received from the athletes was very, very positive. They felt the welcome was jubilant and engaging.

'I was delighted with that response.'

The kiss involving John Barrowman received plenty of backing on Twitter

John Barrowman's gay kiss led to a flood of positive posts on social media websites

Barrowman kissed his 'bride' during the ceremony at Celtic Park, with the scene praised 
as a snub to homophobia in Commonwealth countries.

It is still a crime to be gay in 42 countries of the Commonwealth.

Glasgow-born Barrowman reached out 
to kiss the man before holding his hand during a sequence to celebrate the village of Gretna Green on the Scottish/English border that is 
celebrated as a destination for eloping couples.

Positive response on Twitter was almost immediate.

Graham
 Love tweeted: ‘Nice touch with this kiss there by John Barrowman. 
Taking aim at 42 of the 53 competing nations that criminalise 
homosexuality.’

One Twitter user said: ‘Awesome Gay Kiss’, while another said ‘gay kiss yes john barrowman’.

Craig Drummond tweeted: ‘It makes me strangely proud to be Scottish that to John Barrowman can kiss a man on live tv.’

The entertainer put on a colourful show - and at one point could be seen singing from a platform while surrounded by giant teacakes and tartan-clad dancers

The singer and his band were also driver round atop a tartan Land Rover

Another wrote: ‘I just want john barrowman to kiss more dudes.’

Some even attacked those who spoke out against the kiss.

Fashion editor Tessa Hartmann condemned the embrace while appearing on BBC Breakfast this morning - saying it was inappropriate.

Some reacted in horror at her words - with one saying: 'I don't think your opinions are "appropriate for children" - BBCBreakfast is not the place to push your "political message"'

The columnist has since denied her words were homophobic - instead saying her words have been 'taken out of context'.

But there was expected to be criticism too – the Commonwealth Games, like the Olympics, is not meant to be used for political purposes.

There were also some social media brick bats, too, for the ceremony itself with one user called Bob declaring: ‘Scots Commonwealth Games = worst opening ceremony in history’.

‘Commonwealth games opening ceremony feels a tad Eurovision’, tweeted one, while another observer said:’ Just turned on the commonwealth games opening ceremony, and there was some old people dancing round some chairs, embarrassing.’

Barrowman, who is himself gay, played a key role in the ceremony’s opening minutes, singing from the top of an open top vehicle.
