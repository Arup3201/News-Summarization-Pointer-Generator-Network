As politicians take sides in the great British jobs for British workers debate, this is one vacancy which was not so hotly contested.

Romanian Dumitrita Tudorache started out like thousands of her  compatriots, coming to the UK for work when border restrictions were lifted  on January 1.

But it is unlikely anyone would begrudge her the job she found … having flaming knives thrown at her.

Two days after Dumitrita Tudorache of Snagov, Romania, arrived in the UK, she made her debut as a knife thrower's assistant with the Circus of Horrors

A typical day sees her colleague throw flaming knives at targets just millimetres from her face and body

The 27-year-old works at the Circus 
of  Horrors in London, where colleagues fire blades to stick in a wooden
 board as she stands motionless and fearlessly in front of it.

Far
 from being concerned for her safety, Miss Tudorache, whose hometown of 
Snagov boasts Dracula’s grave, says it is her perfect job.

She
 said: ‘I’ve always loved the circus, and as a child I hoped that one 
day I would be part of it. As soon as I read about the Circus of Horrors
 on the internet, I knew it was perfect. It combines all of my passions:
 horror, travelling and the circus.

‘I never imagined I’d actually be working with them.’

She initially answered an advertisement for an office job at the company.

However, by the end of an interview, she had accepted a job as the knife thrower’s assistant instead.

Dumitrita, who worked as a housekeeper and a babysitter in Romania, admits she isn't sure how future boyfriends will react to her job

Hold still! One person who is still worried about her unusual career choice is her mother

Two
 days after arriving  in the UK on January 8, Miss Tudorache made her 
dramatic debut to a packed house in Brighton. She said: ‘I was so 
excited on my first day that I didn’t think much about the dangers. Of 
course I was a bit afraid, but I’ve got used to it now.

‘Only
 two people have been hit in the last 20 years, so I think my odds are 
good. I just relax and get on with it. I even keep my eyes open. I’d 
much rather see the knives coming at me so I know where they’re coming 
from.’

She added: ‘If you 
value your life, you will naturally not move!’ One person who is still 
worried about her unusual career choice is her mother, who Miss 
Tudorache said is more than a little apprehensive – and possibly a bit 
confused as to how it could have happened, as she used to have a far 
more prosaic job as a housekeeper and babysitter.

Her two brothers work as a driver and a lawyer, and her sister has started a family.

She
 remains unfazed by the dangers. ‘I have complete trust in the team, as 
they are professionals and have been trained.’ However, she isn’t sure 
how any future boyfriends will react. ‘I think they will assume I am 
either very interesting or very crazy!’
