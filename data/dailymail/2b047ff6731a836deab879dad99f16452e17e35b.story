A New Jersey grandfather has been convicted of driving 95 miles per
hour on a Virginia highway with six unrestrained kids while high on heroin.

Isaiah Hall of East Orange pleaded guilty to heroin
possession and endangering the lives of his grandchildren on Wednesday after
his 2012 arrest that included driving on a suspended license.

The 57-year-old said he was returning from a funeral in
North Carolina with his adult daughter and grandchildren, between the ages of 5
and 15, when pulled over on Interstate 295 last spring.

Wild ride: Authorities say Isaiah Hall's minivan was pulled over on this Virginia interstate last spring while speeding 95 mph, high on heroin and carrying six children not wearing seat belts

'No one had on a seat belt and there were two children who
should have had been restrained in booster seats by Virginia law,' Hopewell
Circuit Court prosecutor Elisabeth Custalow told the Richmond Times Dispatch.

Adding to deputies' nightmare were two paper bags containing
heroin that Hall left in the backseat of a squad car, according to Ms Custalow.

'When they lifted up the back seat of the patrol vehicle,
they found three more paper baggies containing the powdered substance,' Custalow
she added.

The childrenâ€™s grandfather admitted to taking the illegal drug
at 4am that morning, roughly six hours before his arrest.

Drug use: Arresting officers say that Hall admitted to having taken heroin earlier that morning after several bags fell out of his possession

He was previously found guilty of reckless driving, driving
on a suspended license and other charges, in addition to his pleas on Wednesday.

He told police at the time that his family had originally
been driving two cars but were forced to cram into one after their second broke
down.

He said in that vehicle was where they left one booster
seat.

Hall is set to be sentenced May 22. Prosecutors say state
sentencing guidelines will likely call for no more than a year in jail.
