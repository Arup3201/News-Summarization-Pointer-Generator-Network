Passing of a legend: Diff'rent Strokes star Conrad Bain has died at the age of 89 on Monday, it was reported on Wednesday

Diff'rent Strokes star Conrad Bain has died aged 89.

The Canadian-American actor, who was famous for playing the father figure Phillip Drummond on the hit sitcom, died on Monday in Livemore, California, or natural causes.

The actor's daughter Jennifer praised on Tuesday, telling TMZ:: 'He was an amazing person. He was a 
lot like Mr Drummond, but much more interesting in real life. He was an 
amazing father.'

Todd Bridges, who played his adopted TV son, said the star will be 'missed, but never forgotten.'

He said: 'I am deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Conrad as we were looking forward to celebrating his 90th birthday next month.

'In addition to being a positive and supportive father figure both on and off-screen, Conrad was well-loved and made going to work each day enjoyable for all of us. He will be missed, but never forgotten.'

Bain, a 
veteran stage and film actor, became a star in middle age playing the 
kindly white adoptive father of two young African-American brothers in 
the TV sitcom.

The show 
that made him famous debuted on NBC in 1978, an era when television 
comedies tackled relevant social issues. Diff'rent Strokes touched on 
serious themes but was known better as a family comedy that drew most of
its laughs from its standout child actor, Gary Coleman.

Bain
played wealthy Manhattan widower Philip Drummond, who promised his 
dying housekeeper he would raise her sons, played by Coleman and Bridges. Race and class relations became topics on the show as much as 
the typical trials of growing up.

Coleman, with his sparkling eyes and 
perfect comic timing, became an immediate star, and Bain, with his long 
training as a theater actor, proved an ideal straight man. The series 
lasted six seasons on NBC and two on ABC.

In the show's heyday, Bain didn't mind
being overshadowed by the focus on the show's children. He praised 
Coleman and Bridges as natural talents without egos.

But Diff'rent Strokes is remembered mostly for its child stars' adult troubles.

Coleman, who died in 2010, had 
financial and legal problems in addition to continuing ill health from 
the kidney disease that stunted his growth and required transplants. 
Bridges and Dana Plato, who played Bain's teenage daughter, both had 
arrest records and drug problems, and Plato died of an overdose in 1999 
at age 34.

Bain said in interviews later that he 
struggled to talk about his TV children's troubled lives because of his 
love for them. After Bridges started to put his drug troubles behind him
in the early 1990s, he told Jet magazine that Bain had become like a 
real father to him.

Bain went directly into Diff'rent Strokes from another comedy, Maude, which aired on CBS from 1972 to 1978.

As Dr. Arthur Harmon, the conservative
neighbor often zinged by Bea Arthur's liberal feminist, Bain became so 
convincing as a doctor that a woman once stopped him in an airport 
seeking medical advice.

At a nostalgia gathering in 1999, he lamented the fading of situation comedies that he said were about something.

'I think they got off the track when 
they first hired a standup comic to do the lead,' he said. 'Instead of 
people creating real situations, you get people trying to act funny.'

Before those television roles, Bain 
had appeared occasionally in films, including A Lovely Way to Die, 
Coogan's Bluff, The Anderson Tapes, I Never Sang for My Father and Woody
Allen's Bananas. He also played the clerk at the Collinsport Inn in the
1960s television show Dark Shadows.

A native of Lethbridge, Alberta, 
Canada, Bain arrived in New York in 1948 after serving in the Canadian 
army during World War II. He was still studying at the American Academy 
of Dramatic Arts when he acquired his first role on television's Studio 
One.

A quick study who could play anything 
from Shakespeare to O'Neill, he found work in stock companies in the 
United States and the Bahamas, making his New York debut in 1956 as 
Larry Slade in The Iceman Cometh at the Circle in the Square.

With his plain looks and down-to-earth manner, he was always cast as a character actor.

It was an audition for a role in the 
1971 film Cold Turkey that led Bain to TV stardom. He didn't get the 
part but 'Cold Turkey' director Norman Lear remembered him when he 
created Maude.

Conrad Stafford Bain attended high 
school in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, deciding on his life's work after an
appearance as the stage manager in a high school production of Our 
Town.

He married artist Monica Sloan in 1945. She died in 2009. He is survived by three children: Jennifer, Kent and Mark.
