Interior designer Iris Apfel, 93, is fast becoming one of the fashion industry's most sought-after models, having just unveiled her second high-profile ad campaign in as many months.

Just weeks after featuring alongside teen blogger Tavi Gevinson in jeweler Alexis Bittar's new campaign, Mrs Apfel has been revealed as the newest face of Kate Spade's Spring 2015 collection, alongside Victoria's Secret favorite Karlie Kloss, 22.

In the campaign, the duo are pictured cosying up to one another on a park bench, with Mrs Apfel modeling a pair of bold green trousers, blue polka-dot socks and a beautifully embellished beige coat, while Miss Kloss is wearing a simple white dress and wedges.

In another image, Mrs Apfel is joined on the bench by an elderly gentleman, who is showcasing an incredibly dapper sense of style in a double-breasted blazer and tie combination.

The US fashion label also called on the talents of some slightly younger models too; one of the most striking images from the campaign features Miss Kloss sitting on the bench reading a book, while two red-headed pre-teen twins cause havoc around her.

Kate Spade is the latest in a long line of high profile brands to defy society's preconceived ideas about the fashion industry's inherent ageism.

In addition to Mrs Apfel's work with Alexis Bittar, the last month has seen the likes of literary legend Joan Didion, 80, modeling for Céline and music icon Joni Mitchell, 71, posing up for French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent.

Meanwhile, Dolce & Gabbana enlisted three older women to help them showcase their Spring 2015 handbags and accessories, opting to avoid using professional models in favor of everyday people.

When speaking about his decision to cast Mrs Apfel alongside blogger turned Broadway star Tavi, 18, in his most recent campaign, jeweler Alexis Bittar said that he didn't use the two women because of their ages, but because of their individuality and sense of independent style.

'We're selling to women who are predominantly over 35, but we’re showing them images of girls who are 19 and retouched,' Mr Bittar told WWD.com.

'For the campaign, we honed in on the essence of strong women who haven’t conformed.'

He added: 'Tavi is so strong and so bright. Iris is kind of like a mother to me at this point and was probably a little bit annoyed that I never asked her to be in an ad [before].'
