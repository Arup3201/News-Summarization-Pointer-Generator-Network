Search: Victor Barnard, 52, is wanted for allegedly raping underage girls for nearly a decade

Officers have launched a massive search - stretching from Minnesota to Washington - for a minister who allegedly raped underage girls for nearly a decade after claiming it was God's word.

Victor A. Barnard, 52, is on the run after authorities in Pine County, Minnesota announced he faces 59
 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving two former members of his sect -
 although he could face more if other alleged victims come forward.

A
 nationwide warrant was issued on April 11 but authorities believe 
followers of his sect, the River Road Fellowship, may be hiding him or throwing cops off the scent.

Now officers in Minnesota and Washington are investigating dozens of leads after the Pine County Sheriff’s Office has been inundated with tips following reports of the search.

'It is nonstop,' Sheriff Robin Cole told the Star Tribune on Thursday.

Washington officers and the U.S. Marshals Service are searching near Spokane, which was Barnard's last known residence, and contacting his associates.

But the people have been 'less than helpful' with the law enforcement search, Cole said.

Officials added that they do not think Barnard has crossed the U.S. border, and that tips have placed him in convenience stores, churches, garbage dumpsters and restaurants - although officials know many of them will be mistaken.

'Brainwashed': Young women gather around Victor A. Barnard, the leader of an alleged cult who is wanted for allegedly repeatedly sexually assaulting the girls, whom he called his 'Maidens'

Barnard fled from Minnesota in 2009 after he was confronted about sleeping with married women.

And in 2012, after enduring years of 
abuse, former sect member Lindsey Tornambe alerted authorities to the 
girls' plight. Another former cult-member, Jess Schweiss, told 
authorities her story.

The women say they were just 12 and 13 when, with their parents permission, they went to live with Barnard as part of a group of 10 women known as the Maidens, Fox9 reported.

The Maidens, aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Bernard and forced to have sex with him anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade.

He said that Jesus and King Solomon had many women followers, so 'God's word' meant that it was normal for him to have sex with them.

'I still had a conscience, I knew it was
 wrong,' Schweiss, who marked every sexual encounter with Barnard with an 'x' on a calendar, told Fox.

Brave: Lindsey Tornambe said her parents took her to Barnard's home when she was 13 and she was left there for nearly a decade. She contacted authorities in 2012 about the abuse

Her father told authorities that he 
'felt pressured to not say anything' about the sexual activity, 
according to the criminal complaint.

Schweiss has now cut her parents out of her life.

'I don't look at them as my parents 
anymore,' she said. 'They weren't the parents I wanted or needed. My
 parents, the people I grew up with as a child, don't exist anymore.'

Speaking with the Star Tribune, Tornambe said she still remembers sitting in the congregation with her parents in 2000 when she was called by Bernard to a 'position of honor'.

After her parents dutifully left her at his ranch, she said Bernard began talking to her about sex and grew angry when she said she did not understand the terms he was using.

He had sex with her anyway and urged her not to tell anyone, she said. She added that her parents rarely came to visit, even though they lived just five miles away.

Claims: Barnard told the women they should have sex with him because it was consistent with God's word

On the run: Police have a nationwide warrant out for his arrest but believe cult members are hiding him

Shunned: Weiss said that her parents, pictured, dismissed her claims that she had been sexually assaulted

She left his cabin when she was 15 but after her parents berated her with their disappointment and Bernard spoke to her about damnation, she reluctantly returned.

'I was really scared, and I didn’t know what receiving damnation from God would be like,' she said. 'I ended up just staying.'

But a few years later, she left permanently and went to live with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania. They still placed Bernard's photographs around their home.

When she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', the criminal complaint notes.

Tornambe eventually became a nanny, but when she heard cousins happily talking about their lives at a New Year's party in 2012, she realized Bernard had robbed her of hers and she called police.

Scene: The River Road Fellowship had land in Minnesota before the claims surfaced and they fled west

Likewise, Schweiss split from the group and moved to Wisconsin in September 2009, but she said she attempted suicide in 2011. When her brother confronted her, she told him about the abuse.

'I feel bad in one sense that I am taking Victor's life away from him by putting him behind bars, but then again, he took my life away from me, which I should have had,' she said. 'So, I feel that - for lack of better words - I think I'm even.'

Tornambe adeed: 'I definitely don't want Victor hurting anyone else.'

Pine County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Steven Blackwell said that the 59 counts only relate to the claims by the two women and that authorities are hopeful more will come forward.

When asked if he believed there were more, he said: 'I don’t know how we couldn't think that.'
