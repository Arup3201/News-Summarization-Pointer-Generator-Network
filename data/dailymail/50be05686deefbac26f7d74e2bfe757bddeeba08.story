Four Iowa teens who met on Xbox and hatched a plan to run away from home were arrested today and charged with trespassing in an abandoned house 360 miles away from their homes.

The girls, Skie Floyd and Jazlyn Visek, both 15, were last seen around noon Saturday at a park in Shellsburg, Iowa, before going on the run with 
13-year-old Austin Michael Boggs and 16-year-old Corey Sunderman from 
Atlantic, Iowa, which is roughly 200 miles from Shellsburg.

'I hysterically started crying, just overwhelmed with joy. All floods of
 emotions. Overjoyed, relief, you name it. I couldn't believe it,' said 
Judy Hamilton, the mother Jazlyn Visek, upon learning her daughter had been found.

The families haven't spoken directly with the children since they were found, but got word today that the teens were being held at the Woodford 
County Correctional Facility.

All the teens will spend the night in jail before facing a judge on trespassing charges Wednesday morning.

'We had a long conversation with the officers who were involved,' 
Sheriff Randall Forsyth of Iowa's Benton County told ABC News. 'They 
told us they located the kids and they were responding to the complaint 
of trespassing at a residence.'

After facing an Illinois judge Wednesday, the teens will be allowed to return home, said Sunderman's mother, Crystal Sunderman.

'We'll probably leave tomorrow morning (for Illinois) in hopes that 
maybe we can see the kids before they go to court because we haven't had
 a chance to talk to them at all,' she said.

Visek started dating Corey Sunderman after the pair met on Xbox.

"This was her first serious boyfriend. He gave her a lot of attention she's never got from any guys," Hamilton said.

The boys vanished Saturday after police brought them to the Sunderman 
home Friday night for violating the town's curfew.

'This is going to sound really stupid,
 but I took all the shoes downstairs and put them in a bag and took them
 up to my room, thinking if I had the boys' shoes, they couldn't go out 
and go skateboarding again,' Crystal Sunderman told ABC.

Police are searching for four teens from Iowa, two girls and two boys, who have been missing since Saturday and are believed to be runaways

The boys found extra boots in the 
garage and left home later that night, taking $400 from Corey's father's
 paycheck, his mother's laptop, and the family's 1997 gold Jeep 
Cherokee.

The Cherokee, which did not have license plates when the boys took it, had been marked with stolen license plates from Atlantic.

Hamilton said she thinks the teens  plotted the escape in advance.

'[Visek] had been planning for a couple weeks at least, and I had no idea,' she said. 'I've learned a valuable lesson on media devices and what you allow your
 children to do on Xbox or Facebook. I admit I was pretty 
free with Jazlyn and I trusted her, and I think I gave her too much 
freedom.'

The two girls and two boys are thought
 to have run away together after the boys took one of their parent's 
cars and then allegedly drove across the state for four hours to pick up
 the girls.

Corey has run away from home twice before but he has returned both times and has no criminal history.

A local storeowner reported that he had seen the boys driving 
that car early Saturday morning.

The owner said that he allowed the boys to use the shop phone but only if they did so on speakerphone.

'The conversation was something to the
 effect of, 'Don't pick us up at our house. Pick us up at the Quick 
Stop,' said sheriff Randall Forsyth.

Though the parents are happy to know their children are safe, they're still wondering what they could have done to prevent the situation.

"I'm starting to worry about what am I going to do to keep Corey, to 
keep him safe... We've got to fix whatever it was that made him leave. 
He's had some problems at school with bullying but honestly, I don't 
know," Sunderman said.
