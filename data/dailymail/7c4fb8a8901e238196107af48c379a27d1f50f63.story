Sergio Garcia could look back on a battle well fought throughout Sunday: ‘It looks like I’m finally growing up now,’ concluded the 34-year-old Spaniard.

It sounded like even he would agree that the process had taken some time. But this was one of his Major near-misses from which he could genuinely take pride, certainly more than was the case when he was in contention at this same course eight years ago.

It was on that sunbaked afternoon at Royal Liverpool that he came out dressed from head to toe like a canary and subsided woefully as Tiger Woods romped to the title. Afterwards the American is said to have texted to a friend that ‘I just bludgeoned Tweetie Pie’.

Garcia was not there to be swatted away this time, and he never allowed Rory McIlroy to relax, to the point where he forced himself from a starting point of seven shots back to get within two on the 13th and 14th holes.

His closing 66 ensured this was never a procession as fortune favoured the brave, and he rode the odd decent bounce to make life uncomfortable for McIlroy playing in the pair behind.

‘I wanted to make him feel it a little bit and see how he would respond,’ said Garcia. ‘Every time I got closer he kept making one more birdie. 

‘It’s not easy when you know you can’t make any mistakes, there are so many things that need to go right for you to shoot at least eight or nine under. But at least I’m proud of the way I played and I’m happy.’

He also admitted that he had the odd lucky break, such as when his ball rebounded off the grandstand on the 12th and fractionally missed the bunker on the 13th. It was a far cry from some of the self-pitying inquests he has conducted after coming close in the Majors, when either the world seemed to have been against him or he had declared that he was simply not good enough, as happened at the 2012 Masters.

Garcia is from the Jimmy White school of sporting bridesmaids and this was the 19th time he has finished in the top ten in what is already his 63rd appearance at one of the big four championships. In golf, specifically, he belongs to the same bracket as Lee Westwood and Colin Montgomerie, particularly as all three have contrastingly excelled under the steamhammer pressure the Ryder Cup brings.

Unlike the latter for sure and, you now suspect, the former, he still has a chance of breaking his duck when it comes to the pursuit of the highest individual honours.

Garcia emerged with far more credit than his playing partner Dustin Johnson, who not only failed to mount a charge in shooting level par but spat his way round this corner of the Wirral Peninsula, just as he had done on the putting green.

The Spaniard signalled his intention with two birdies in the first three holes, and then allowed himself a glance at the scoreboard on the eighth as McIlroy wobbled behind him.

A 12-foot putt helped him eagle the tenth and his challenge only expired when went into the bunker on the 15th, and his first attempt to get out hit the wall and rebounded back in.

His problem going forward is that, having been denied by Woods in his pomp, he now has to confront another outstanding rival in McIlroy. 

But it may be time to start loving Garcia, even at those times when he is not wrapped in Europe’s Ryder Cup flag.
