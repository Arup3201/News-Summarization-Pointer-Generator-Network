The three girls who were held captive for a decade can't be left on their own because they were so 'brainwashed' they thought they the others would always be around, MailOnline can reveal.

Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight have to be walked around in groups because they get agitated if they are left on their own.

Relatives said that because they had spent so much time in each other's company they could not comprehend what it was like to be left alone.

Coming home: Gina Dejesus, now 23, who 
disappeared in Cleveland, Ohio in 2004, escaped from a home on Monday 
just miles from where she went missing - and is believed to have known 
her abductor

Transitioning: The DeJesus family are trying to figure out the best way for reintegrate her into society

Gina is also more 'on edge' when men 
are around compared to when there are just women in the room - a 
chilling result of her years of alleged abuse at the hands of Ariel 
Castro.

Jackie Figaro-Roman,
 an aunt of Gina DeJesus who was among the welcoming committee at her 
home to welcome her back, told MailOnline that the families are only now
 coming to terms with the impact the captivity has had on the girls.

She said: 'They were brainwashed. They can't walk around by themselves and they have to walk around in groups.

'It's because they spent so much time with those other girls.'

Asked how Gina is doing, she added: '(Her mother) Nancy is so happy.

Joy: Nancy Ruiz, mother of Gina, hugs a police officer as her daughter arrives at her home on Wednesday

Return: Gina gives a thumbs-up for the crowds as she is escorted toward her home on Wednesday

'Little by little Gina is coming out (of herself).

'Gina is afraid of too many people, 
she's afraid of crowds. She is still more comfortable around women (than
 men). She's very timid.

'When men are around she is different. She's more on edge.

'She's not talking much, she's smiling.

'The family wants to tell people more and thank them for all they did.'

Miss
 Figaro-Roman also revealed that Gina's family are already planning a 
reunion for the girls so that they can help each other heal and move on.

She said: 'We want to get these girls together. We want to try to help Michelle.'

Shared experiences: DeJesus' relatives said that they plan to arrange meetings with Gina and Michelle Knight (pictured) as well as Amanda Berry since they were so used to spending time together in captivity

Happy ending: Amanda Berry (center, seen with her sister at left and the daughter she birthed in captivity) was the one who broke free and helped save the other kidnapped girls

Psychologists have said that it will be many years, if ever, before the girls will be able to come to terms with their ordeal and that they will have to undergo intensive therapy.

Dr Tina Walch, director of ambulatory services at Zucker Hillside Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York, has also spoken of how the 'human need for affiliation' would have asserted itself, meaning they formed a warped bond with their alleged kidnapper and the other captives.

As the young women begin to re-adjust to their free life, leaked police reports give the public more clues into the harrowing lives they were forced to lead for roughly a decade.

'Captor': Ariel Castro, 52, has been charged with kidnapping and raping the three women

Knight, now 32, says she saved the 
life of Berry's daughter Jocelyn when she was born in an inflatable pool
 six years ago at the 'house of horrors'.

Castro
 allegedly told the girls that if the baby died, he would kill Amanda. 
She said that she put her mouth to Jocelyn's and 'breathed for her' - to
 save both their lives.

After saving the infant's life, Knight was told to clean up the mess.

Castro initially held all three women chained up in the basement, the report says, but later allowed them to live together on the second floor after years in captivity.

On the two occasions they were allowed out into the daylight, they were taken out into the backyard, but were heavily disguised with wigs and sunglasses.

And in a bizarre and twisted ritual, Castro marked the date of each woman's abductions every year by serving them dinner and a cake, one victim's cousin told the New York Times.

Castro also made sure Jocelyn - his daughter with Amanda - did not know the real names of DeJesus or Knight - because he didn't want the young girl to repeat their names in public.

Knight told investigators she fell pregnant five times, but lost the baby each time. She said she was starved and repeatedly punched in the stomach to force her to miscarry.

DeJesus told police that she did not think she ever became pregnant during her captivity.

The report said that none of the three women ever saw a doctor or had medical treatment in the decade they were held captive.

It also reveals how when police forced their way into the house on Monday afternoon, a terrified DeJesus jumped into the arms of the police officer.
