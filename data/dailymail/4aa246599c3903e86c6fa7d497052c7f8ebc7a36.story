Chelsea are willing to let forward Islam Feruz, leave
the club on loan - with Cardiff City, Derby, Reading and Brighton are all keen in the talented youngster.

The 18-year-old signed a new deal at the start of the year after impressing for the Blues' Under 21 side - helping them win the Under 21 Premier League championship last
 season

Jose Mourinho is keen for the youngster to gain first team experience on loan next
 season to aid his development.

Meanwhile, the Somalia-born teenager has sensationally
 has recently turned his back on Scotland – earning a sharp rebuke from the man 
whose rule change fast-tracked the former Celtic striker into the 
international game.

Feruz featured for Scotland
 at Under-17 and Under-21 level but has not played for his adopted nation since a 6-0
 hammering by England Under-21s in Sheffield last August.

SFA chief 
executive, Gordon Smith pushed through a change allowing youngsters who 
had gone through a country’s education system to represent their adopted
 nation.

Smith
 told Sportsmail that he was saddened – but not surprised – to learn of 
Feruz’s decision, saying: ‘He is a real talent, of that there is no 
doubt. There’s a reason he was capped at age groups several steps beyond
 his actual years – he is a great talent.

‘But I 
felt his attitude was wrong when he left Celtic, to be honest. Celtic 
did a lot for him, helped his family, helped him enormously.

‘I
felt it was a slap in the face, leaving Celtic the way he did and 
throwing in his lot with Chelsea. I was personally disappointed with 
that, because I thought he should have shown more loyalty.'
