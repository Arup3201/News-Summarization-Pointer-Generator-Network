November holidaymakers who are looking for cheap eats or beer should head to Prague while those who want to take in the sights in the sun should jet to Marrakech or Dubai.

Those are some of the findings of a Travelzoo study that analysed ten popular autumn city break destinations.

The travel website has put together a helpful planner for tourists, breaking down each city in categories including affordability, weather, public transit costs and food.

Prague, one of the coldest November destinations, offers cheap eats and affordable public transit rates

Based on advice from travel experts in each city, the infographic offers budgeting tips and dining and hotel recommendations to help holidaymakers to plan their trip.

In terms of spending power, Prague came out on top with an average meal for two costing just £18, while London was the most expensive at £50.

Prague - one of the coldest November destinations - also has one of the cheapest public transit rates, although its bike hire is tied with New York as the most expensive at £6 per day.

The infographic also lists suggestions for those who are looking to avoid crowds.

Those who are heading to Paris, for example, should stop by Chateau de Vincennes, a royal castle east of the French capital, while tourists in Rome should visit the Knights of Malta Keyhole.
