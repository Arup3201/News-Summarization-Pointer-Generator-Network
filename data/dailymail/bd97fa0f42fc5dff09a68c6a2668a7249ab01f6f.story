According to Us Weekly, the bride tied the knot with Ryan on the same date she had planned to get married to ex Big Sean.

The July 19 nuptials also fall, a source told the publication, on Dorsey's birthday.

'Naya didn’t tell most of her friends that she was marrying Ryan Dorsey, let alone that she was dating him!' the insider claimed. 'The whole thing is a complete surprise.'

Meanwhile another insider told Us that Naya used the same wedding hairstylist as Kim Kardashian, Clyde Haygood.

In addition the source also claimed Naya's Monique Lhuillier dress looked 'a lot like the one Kim married Kanye in'.

TMZ is reporting Dorsey's father, Arnold, has told them that the wedding date may have coincided with Naya's previous nuptial plans but that more significant is that it was his son's birthday.

He also revealed to the gossip website that he only learned of the wedding six weeks ago: 'We didn’t question him. We are very happy for him. We trusted them and want what they wanted.'

Arnold also claimed that the wedding consisted of only 12 people from the bride and groom's families.

Naya and Dorsey's romance only became public last week after they were photographed holidaying together in Mexico.

The couple confirmed they had married in Cabo San Lucas on July 19, exclusively to People magazine.

In a joint 
statement, the couple said: 'We feel truly blessed to be joined as 
husband and wife. Our special day was fated and everything we could have
 ever asked for.

'True love always prevails.'

Naya, 27, walked down the aisle in a Monique Lhuillier gown while her groom looked dapper in a Dolce & Gabbana suit.

Ryan, who 
is from West Virginia, has starred in a series of TV shows and films, 
including Unspoken, Southland, Parks and Recreation and Mob City.

He recently wrapped filming on Blood Father alongside Mel Gibson and William H Macy.

Although the couple had only just started dating recently, they had been friends for four years.

Their friendship turned to love after Naya's six month engagement to rapper Big Sean ended in April.

His big day: Ryan's birthday fell on the same date as his wedding

Big
 Sean, real name Sean Anderson, said at the time it was his decision to 
end the engagement, but denied claims he had cheated on her.

His rep said: 'After careful thought and much consideration, Sean has made the difficult decision to call the wedding off.

'The recent rumours and accusations reported by so called or fake sources are simply untrue.

'Sean wishes Naya nothing but the best and it is still his hope that they can continue to work through their issues privately. We will not be commenting again on this matter.'

Prior to Big Sean, Naya also dated Glee writer Matthew Hodgson and her co-star Mark Salling.
