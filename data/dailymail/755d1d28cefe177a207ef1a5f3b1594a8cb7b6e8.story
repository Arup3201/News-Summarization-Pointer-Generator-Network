Burnley and Championship leaders Derby are exploring a potential move for Ecuador's latest sensation Junior Sornoza.

The 20-year-old has been grabbing the headlines in South America as one of the up and coming talents and English clubs are being sounded out as he looks to make a move to Europe.

Sornoza has been likened to Real Madrid's James Rodriguez as he can play as a second striker, on the left wing or as an attacking midfielder yet is available for around £3.5million. Importantly, he is also a regular for Ecuador so will meet work permit criteria.

Ecuador teammates West Ham's Enner Valencia and Antonio Valencia of Manchester United have already encouraged him to make the move and his agents are due in England over the coming weeks to talk to interested parties.

Sornoza plays for Independiente and has shot to prominence with his assists and a variety of goals including a long range winner against Botafogo in the Copa Libertadores in March. He ended the tournament with four goals and three assists in six games.

Although relatively small in height, he is a strong runner with good balance and is adept at taking set-pieces.

Burnley do not want to spend big in January and will look at loans in the main but they are interested as the price falls within their budget and Sornoza would represent good sell-on value.
