'Joe the Plumber', the everyman used by John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign, has sparked outrage with an online comment piece claiming 'America needs a white, Republican president'.

In an article posted to his website on Thursday, Joe Wurzelbacher assured readers that wanting a 'white Republican president doesn’t make you a racist, it just makes you American.'

The controversial post contended that '[i]n the pre-black president era, criticizing the president was simply the American thing to do. An exercise of one’s First Amendment right. Criticism had nothing to do with color, because there had never been a black president.'

The eyebrow-raising opinion piece questioned why nobody accused black people of racism 'when blacks had sanity and disagreed with the policies of racist white Democrat presidents.'

The conservative activist also brought Mexicans into his argument, saying 'many deranged Mexicans' who fight for immigration rights 'are not called racist.' 

The scathing post has triggered a social media backlash, with users accusing Republican party member Wurzelbacher of racism.

The Daily Edge wrote: '#ThatAwkwardMoment when racist Joe the racist Plumber says wanting racist things doesn't make him a racist #racism'.

John wrote: 'A white President killed 100.000's in Iraq. A black President gives healthcare to kids with cancer. Joe the Plumber wants the white one. #p2'

Joe the Plumber uploaded the controversial remarks to his JoeforAmerica.com website on Thursday

Fight back: Joe Wurzelbacher defended his post on Facebook, saying he merely reproduced the comment piece of a 'black guy'

Defensive: Wurzelbacher said he did not author the controversial piece. He said he copied the post, written by Kevin Jackson (pictured), verbatim to his site from theblacksphere.net.

However Wurzelbacher has hit back, saying he did not author the piece but merely copied an article written Kevin Jackson and posted to theblacksphere.net on October 9.

According to his profile, Jackson 'believes that empowerment comes when you know who you are and what you stand for.'

On Saturday night, Wurzelbacher, 39, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Let no chance to find a boogey man in a non-racist's closet go by without first taking time to blame a white guy for repeating something a black guy said...about a black guy.'

Joe the Plumber gained national prominence when he asked then presidential candidate, Barack Obama, a question about his tax plan in 2008.

Obama's response included the statement, 'when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.'

Obama's response was seized upon by conservative media, as well as by Obama's rival, Republican nominee Senator John McCain, as an indication that Obama was interested in the redistribution of wealth, and had a socialist view of the economy.
