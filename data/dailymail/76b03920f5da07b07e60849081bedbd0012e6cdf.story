It seems that two famous British Kates - Middleton and Moss - have been influencing the way UK women dress - and, in particular, how much flesh they choose to bare.

We may have invented the miniskirt, but these days British women are some of the most covered-up in Europe, wearing longer skirts and less revealing tops than their continental counterparts, according to new research.

British modesty: The conservative style of the Duchess of Cambridge, left, and comments made by Kate Moss, right, are proving influential in the way British women choose to dress

Skirts in Britain tend to hang, on average, 10cm longer than those worn in France and Italy, while
the majority of British women cover their upper arms, cleavages and 
legs above the knee, according to research carried out by Parisian fashion house Georgede.

The findings revealed that French 
and Italian women wear the shortest skirts, followed by the Spanish and 
Germans, then the Scandinavians, Austrians and Brits.

In fact, only women in Luxembourg wear longer skirts than those in Britain do, but their clothes are still more revealing overall.

Georgede's MD Phillip Bendavid said: 'It is very much the Kate effect. Kate Middleton and Kate Moss are leading the charge.

'Kate Mossâ€™ recent comment that women should cover up more is very much a reflection of what is happening in the UK.'Increasingly, British women are becoming more conservative in the way they dress.'The Duchess of Cambridge is also definitely influencing the way British women are dressing.'For example, you never see her inappropriately dressed. She covers up those areas that women are very conscious about.'

Continental curves: European women including Italian Nancy Dell'Olio, left, and Spain's Elen Rivas, right, have been found to bare more flesh than their British counterparts

A survey of 1,000 British women found 61 per cent of those aged 35 and over were most likely to avoid baring their upper arms, and 54 per cent of this age group cover their knees.

Only 37 per cent of the over 35s and only 19 per cent of those under 35 choose to cover their cleavage.

Mr Bendavid added that he approved of British women's new-found fondness British for covering-up.

He said: 'Imagination is a wonderful thing. A women is often more alluring when sufficiently well-covered.'
