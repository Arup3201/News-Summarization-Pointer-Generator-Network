Parties broke out across the country on Tuesday night in the winners' camps of newly-elected governors and city mayors, following months of hard-fought campaigns.

Among the expected shoo-ins were victories for Republican governor Chris Christie in New Jersey and Democrat Bill de Blasio as the next New York City mayor.

One of the biggest celebrations, but hardly surprising, happened in New Jersey as Republican Chris Christie was returned to office for a second term as governor.

Christie was declared the winner in today's gubernatorial election just minutes after the polls closed across the state.

While the final margin of victory was still being counted, Christie was expected to become the first Republican in a quarter-century to receive more than 50 per cent of the New Jersey vote, handily defeating Democrat Barbara Buono.

Just before 10.15pm on Tuesday, a beaming Christie took the stage 
inside the Asbury Park convention center to deliver his victory speech.

Flanked
by his wife and children, a jubilant second-term governor began his address by 
thanking New Jersey voters for making him 'the luckiest guy in the 
world'.

Christie
devoted a large part of his victory speech to the state’s recovery 
efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which he dubbed his 'mission', saying that he will not stop working until every resident 
affected by the storm is made whole again.

‘I will never stop 
leading the state I love,’ Christie stressed, pledging to govern the 
state through his second term in the unifying spirit of Sandy. 

There
were equally jubilant celebrations in neighboring New York as 
Democrat Bill de Blasio celebrated his city mayoral win surrounded by his 
family, celebrity friends Susan Sarandon and Cynthia Nixon and 
hundreds of cheering supporters.

The former public advocate romped to a landslide 
victory as mayor, becoming the first Democrat to hold 
the position in a generation.

The
victory heralded the beginning of a new liberal era of higher taxes on New York City's rich and
plans to concentrate on the poorer boroughs that critics 
say outgoing Mayor Mike Bloomberg has neglected in favor of Manhattan.

De
Blasio, a 52-year-old Italian-American from Brooklyn, had led strongly throughout election day against
his Republican rival Joe Lhota, former chief of the metropolitan area's
transit agency.

De Blasio's 15-year-old son Dante has been a huge hit on the campaign trail with even President Obama admiring the teenager's Afro

'Today you
spoke loudly and clearly for a new direction for our city,' de Blasio 
told a rollicking crowd of supporters at the YMCA in his home 
neighborhood of Park Slope, Brooklyn, a far cry from the glitzy 
Manhattan hotel ballrooms that usually host election night parties.

To
the delight of supporters, de Blasio, his teenage son Dante, daughter Chiara and wife Chirlane performed the family's 'smack down' dance on stage 
which has become a favorite on the campaign trail.

'We are united in the belief that our 
city should leave no New Yorker behind,' he added. 'The people of this 
city have chosen a progressive path, and tonight we set forth on it 
together as one city.'

Democrats also captured the other two 
citywide races: Letitia James, a Brooklyn city councilwoman, was elected
public advocate, while Scott Stringer, the Manhattan Borough President,
was chosen to be comptroller.

In Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and long-time Clinton confidante, won a close race on Tuesday to become governor.

McAuliffe had held solid double-digit polling leads over Ken Cuccinelli, the state's tea party-backed Republican attorney general.

But ultimately fewer than 55,000 votes – out of more than 2.2 million cast – separated the pair.

Up in Michigan, a former medical center chief defeated a county sheriff to become the first white mayor of financially troubled Detroit since 1974 - although the job holds little power while the city is being run by a state-appointed emergency manager.

Mike Duggan defeated Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon 55 per cent to 45 per cent. Napoleon conceded defeat late on Tuesday in a race where he was outspent by Duggan by about 3-to-1.

Both candidates had said during the campaign that the state-appointed emergency manager should leave the city and allow the new mayor to fix Detroit's finances when he takes office in January.

‘I'm going to try to shorten Kevyn Orr's stay,’ Duggan has said but the reality is that Duggan will have little power under emergency manager Kevyn Orr, who in July filed to take Detroit into bankruptcy.
