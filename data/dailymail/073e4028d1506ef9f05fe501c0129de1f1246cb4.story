Work has started on repairing the roof of the Silverstone motor racing circuit which was damaged by high winds during the last couple of days.

Part of the 'Wing' - the $40million (£27m), three-story corporate building at the host venue of Formula One's British Grand Prix - was affected by the winds on late Sunday and Monday. 

Images on social media appeared to show a section of the roof had been removed.

Silverstone sporting director Stuart Pringle insists upcoming events will not be affected by recent damage 

Silverstone's sporting director, Stuart Pringle, says in a statement that the site 'looks a bit of a mess at the moment' but 'the damage is largely cosmetic, and the structural and functional integrity of the roof remains completely intact.'

Pringle says upcoming races will not be affected.

Silverstone officials say engineers began assessing the damage on Wednesday.
