Looking to seal the deal with a colleague you have a crush on this festive season?

You're not alone because nearly one million Brits are heading to their Christmas party in the hope of becoming closer to a colleague they fancy, according to a new study.

And it seems they may be in luck because two million Brits have admitted to hooking up with a colleague at the December event.

Looking to take the office flirtations to the next level? A new survey has revealed that 2 million Brits have hooked up at the work Christmas party

Of the 11 million people heading to events this week, those aged between 25 to 34 are the most 
likely to get lucky, with a presumptuous six per cent even considering booking a hotel room to continue the festive flirtations.

The study also found that over one million Brits have 
admitted to doing the notorious ‘walk of shame’ - going into work the 
next day wearing the same clothes from the night before.

Presumptive 25-34-year-olds are the most likely to get lucky, with 6 per cent even considering booking a hotel room

However, it seems there may be a risk 
of embarrassment for some, with six per cent admitting to sleeping in a public place such as a bus stop or a train station 
after their work Christmas party.

A spokesperson from Hotels.com mobile app, who carried out the survey, said: 'After working longer hours and being more careful with spending over the year, it’s understandable that hard-working Brits want to let their hair down and the Christmas party is the perfect opportunity for this to happen.

'But while it’s fine to indulge, if you do find yourself getting into an embarrassing situation, having a phone handy can help get you away quickly and easily – from booking a cab to finding a hotel at the click of the button – so you don’t need to worry about explaining yourself to your colleagues the next day!'
