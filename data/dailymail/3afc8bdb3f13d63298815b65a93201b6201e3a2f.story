Allegations: Naomi Campbell will face a trial in Italy after it was claimed that she assaulted a photographer in 2009

Naomi Campbell has been ordered to stand trial for an alleged attack on an Italian photographer, which put him in hospital.

The supermodel allegedly flew at paparazzo Gaetano Di Giovanni battering him and scratching him, after he took pictures of her on holiday with her billionaire ex-boyfriend.

Mr Di Giovanni claimed his face was scratched and bruised after Miss Campbell, allegedly slapped him and hit him with her handbag.

The supermodel’s ‘nails had damaged his left eye’, he told Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

‘For a few seconds I could not see a thing. I could hear that her bodyguards and her boyfriend were trying to drag her away.’

He told the Italian newspaper: ‘First she hit with her bag, screaming at me and then she tried to slap me.

‘I managed to avoid her – but her nails still got my eye.

Miss Campbell denies the allegations and in a statement today her spokesman said: 'Three years ago Ms Campbell was the victim of paparazzi harassment in Italy.

'The photographer has claimed to have been attacked by Ms Campbell, a claim our client has categorically denied and her team is confident to prove this in court later this year'.

The alleged attack took place on the island of Lipari off the coast of Sicily in July 2009.

Di Giovanni claims it took three days to recover from an eye injury, which he said was certified by medical experts at a local emergency room.

The Streatham-born model has been summoned to appear in court in Sicily on December 4, legal sources told the Italian news agency ANSA.

Lipari is part of the Eoliean Islands, a chain of volcanic islands stretching between Sicily and the mainland.

Miss Campbell had caused a sensation when she arrived on the island by yacht with her Russian boyfriend Vladislav Doronin.

Over a career that has spanned spanned four decades the beauty has acquired a reputation for having a short temper.

She was sentenced to attend anger-management classes in 1998, after striking her personal assistant Georgina Galanis with a mobile phone.

And in 2010 she reportedly punched and slapped her limousine driver, again with a mobile phone.
