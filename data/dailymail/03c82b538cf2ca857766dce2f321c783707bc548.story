Colin Powell's former chief of staff publicly blasted the Republican Party and one of Mitt Romney’s top aide as racists over a controversial comment regarding Powell’s endorsement of President Obama.

Appearing on Ed Schultz's MSNBC show Friday, retired Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson said, 'My party is full of racists' in response to John Sununu's remark that the only reason Powell, a Republican who served as secretary of state under George W. Bush, backed the Democratic incumbent is because both men are black.

Wilkerson told Schultz that he respected Sununu 'as a Republican,' but did ‘not have any respect for the integrity of the position that [Sununu] seemed to codify.

Outraged: Colin Powell's former chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson said the Republican Party was 'full of racists' who want President Obama out of the White House because he's black

The Huffington Post reported that when the host asked the general what, 
if anything, Sununu's statement said about the attitudes of the GOP, 
Wilkerson responded by saying:

'My party, unfortunately, is the 
bastion of those people -- not all of them, but most of them -- who are 
still basing their positions on race.

'Let me just be candid: My Party is 
full of racists, and the real reason a considerable portion of my party 
wants President Obama out of the White house has nothing to do with the 
content of his character, nothing to do with his competence as 
commander-in-chief and president, and everything do with the color of 
his skin, and that's despicable.'

Wilkerson's harsh condemnation of the
 GOP comes after Sununu said he did not believe General Powell switched 
parties and endorsed Barack Obama because he likes his policies.

He
 said: ‘Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to 
wonder whether that’s an endorsement based on issues or whether he’s got
 a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama.’

Wilkerson also added that 'to say 
that Colin Powell would endorse President Obama because of his skin 
color is like saying Mother Theresa worked for profit.'

The president himself dismissed Sununu's racially charged comment on Friday while appearing on Michael Smerconish's radio show.

Support: Colin Powell (left) voted for Barack Obama (right) in 2008, and has announced he will do so again this year. The race for the White House has polarised voters along racial lines

Claim: John Sunumu has suggested that Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama's presidential campaign because they are both black

'Any suggestion that general Powell 
would make such a profound statement in such an important election based
 on anything but what he thought was what's going to be best for America
 doesn't make much sense,’ Obama said.

Asked to explain what he meant by Piers Morgan on CNN, he said: 'Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you’re proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.'

Mr Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire and  White House Chief of Staff under President George H. W. Bush, later backed away from his racially-charged comment on Thursday night.

But it immediately sparked outrage among Democrats just hours before a new poll showed a growing black-white divide in America’s viciously polarized politics.

The mixed-race Mr Obama successfully sold himself in  2008 as a 'post-racial' president who would bridge America’s historic black-white divide.

But a tracking poll for the Washington Post shows the president is struggling to connect with many of the white voters who supported him four years ago.

Revelation: Mr Powell, a former general, made his endorsement during an interview on CBS This Morning

While Mr Obama is still supported by the vast majority – some 80 per cent - of black and Hispanic voters, his share of whites has fallen from 43 percent in 2008 to 37 percent this year.

This puts him 23 points behind Mr Romney among white voters.

The survey shows that Mr Obama’s dwindling popularity since he was trounced by Mitt Romney in their first TV debate has been particularly severe among white voters in three categories - men, people without university degrees and those who describe themselves as politically uncommitted.

That last section is particularly important as both sides are aware that it is America’s relatively small number of swing voters who are likely to decide the election.

Attack: John McCain has criticised Mr Powell for giving his support to the Obama campaign

The survey provided additional good 
news for Mr Romney, seeing him pull ahead of Mr Obama overall by 50 
percent of the national vote to 47 percent.

Despite the exodus of white voters from the Democrats, the tracking poll showed that they still distrust Mr Romney.

Forty eight percent of white voters said
 a Romney presidency would do more to help the rich while most of them 
believe Mr Obama will do more to assist the middle class.

Mr Sununu's comments followed an attack on Mr Powell by former presidential candidate John McCain who said he has 
'harmed his legacy' by turning away from the Republican Party.

Worry: Mr Obama's support among white voters is flagging, according to a new poll

Change: Mr Powell has criticised Mitt Romney's shifting position on many foreign policy issues

A poll by Time magazine also showed 
Mr Obama doing badly among white voters in Ohio, widely seen as the 
state that Mr Romney must win if he is to have a chance of taking the 
White House.

According to the survey, the 
president is trailing the Republican by six per cent among whites in the 
state even though Mr Obama rescued a US car industry that is one of 
Ohio’s main sources of jobs.

Compounding alarm for the Democrats, 
there is growing concern that many African-Americans have lost 
enthusiasm for the once-inspirational president and may not turn out on 
polling day.

Mr Powell served in the Vietnam War before entering public life as President Reagan's National Security Advisor.

He oversaw the conduct of the Gulf War as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was Secretary of State during the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
