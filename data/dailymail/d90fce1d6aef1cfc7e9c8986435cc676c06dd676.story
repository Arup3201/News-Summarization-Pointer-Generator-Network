Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will give an exclusive interview to the world's biggest newspaper website, and our readers get to choose the questions

When Mr Cameron answered questions from MailOnline last month he revealed how he watched the horrific ISIS beheading videos of British hostages to understand what families have been going through.

The PM defended spending billions on foreign aid, breaking his promise to cut immigration and suggested that we no longer live in what he once called 'broken Britain'.

The Tory leader also claimed he was not scared of Nigel Farage, spoke of his love of Gogglebox and Game of Thrones, and the parental woes of listening to the songs of Disney film Frozen over and over again.

But he rowed back from once describing Mr Clegg as his favourite political joke, claiming it was now 'my good friend Ed Balls'.

Ahead of his interview this week, Mr Clegg is under pressure to show his party will not face wipeout in the general election on May 7.

MailOnline readers are now being asked to submit questions to the Lib Dem leader. Readers might want to ask him about tuition fees, immigration and Europe.

Or what he plans to do with his life after politics, his favourite TV shows and movies, and life at home with wife Miriam and his three sons.

Post your questions in the comments section and the best will be put to Mr Clegg in an exclusive interview with MailOnline later this week.
