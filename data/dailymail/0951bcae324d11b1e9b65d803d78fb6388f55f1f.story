Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who has been publicly identified as having the first diagnosed case of Ebola in the United States, was reportedly a passenger on both Brussels Airlines and United Airlines flights before his arrival at Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport. 

Details of Duncan's 28-hour trip from western Africa emerged Wednesday. He flew on two airlines, took three flights, and had lengthy airport layovers before reaching Texas on Sept. 20.

Duncan left Monrovia, Liberia, on Sept. 19 aboard a Brussels Airlines jet to the Belgian capital, according to a Belgian official.

A request for comment to the airline from MailOnline was not immediately answered.

United Airlines said in a Wednesday statement 'The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has informed us that the patient said he flew part of his trip on United.'

Passenger: Thomas Eric Duncan was reportedly on two United Airlines flights before he was admitted to a Dallas hospital 

'While the CDC states it is unnecessary for it or the airline to contact others who were on the patient’s flights, United is providing information about the flights United believes the patient took, based on information provided by the CDC,' the airline also said. 'We are ensuring our employees have this information and suggest that any customers who have concerns contact the experts at the CDC for further information.'

The airline's statement said it believed the man was on board Flight 951 from Brussels, Belgium to Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, and later was a passenger on Flight 822, which went from Washington Dulles to Dallas/Fort Worth International  Airport.

The first reported case of Ebola in the United States is spooking airline investors and raising the prospect that some frightened travelers might stay home despite repeated reassurances from public-health experts. 

Flight plan: Thomas Eric Duncan reportedly arrived in Dallas after flying on two airlines and taking three flights 

Still, federal officials say other passengers on the flights are at no risk of infection because the man had no symptoms at the time of his trip.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Duncan sought medical care Sept. 24 in Dallas.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health, told The Associated Press that even though Duncan took several flights to reach the U.S., his lack of symptoms at the time made it 'extraordinarily unlikely' that he infected anyone else on the planes.

Still, the incident spooked airline investors. Shares of United and other leading U.S. airline companies dropped 2.8 percent or more. Shares of European carriers fell by similar margins.

Deadly: The Ebola virus has killed thousands in West Africa already 

'The fear is if this gets worse, it would affect people's travel behavior,' said Joseph DeNardi, an analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Health officials "sound confident that they've got it under control. Hopefully they're right.'

The CDC typically notifies an airline when it learns that an infectious person traveled on that carrier. The airline then turns over the flight manifest to CDC, and health officials notify other passengers while the airline deals with crew members.

In this case, the CDC told United but not the public what flights the man took. In an interview Wednesday with the AP, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, suggested that doing so would divert public-health resources away from controlling an outbreak of the virus. He said the CDC was focused on finding and tracking anyone who came in contact with Duncan after he began showing symptoms.

Public health officials have assured fliers that airports in Africa, Europe and the U.S. are taking all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including screening passengers for fever.

An outbreak of SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - crippled air travel in Asia in 2003. Michael Derchin, an analyst with CRT Capital Group, said it was too early to draw a comparison between one Ebola patient and the 2003 SARS outbreak. He noted that SARS is an airborne disease that health officials say is transmitted more easily than Ebola.
