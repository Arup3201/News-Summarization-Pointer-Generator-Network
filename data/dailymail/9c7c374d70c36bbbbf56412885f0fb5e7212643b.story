Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes Premier League clubs should think twice before signing his former team-mate and Barcelona defender Gerard Pique. 

The Spaniard left Old Trafford for La Liga in 2008 and has gone on to win 15 major club titles, but is now on the fringes of the first team and has been a linked with a return to England. 

But Scholes insists the Barca style suits the centre back, who he says while he is a 'very talented defender', Pique would find it difficult operating in a team without possession.

Paul Scholes believes Gerard Pique would find it tough in the Premier League were he to return

The Spanish defender played for four years at Old Trafford but was sold for £5million in 2008

Paul Scholes says Pique prefers it when his team is in possession and he may not be comfortable in England

'I have always thought that Spanish football, and Barcelona in particular, suits him best,' Scholes revealed in his column in The Independent.

'He likes being in a side that keeps possession. He is great at home but playing away at the big teams in England is a completely different prospect for a defender. 

'His success at Barcelona and with Spain has been incredible. But I think Gerard would find it harder back in the Premier League.'

Pique made just 33 competitive appearances during his four seasons at Old Trafford, after United poached him from the Catalan giants as a teenager.

Pique has won 15 major club titles since leaving Manchester United for Barcelona

He went straight into Pep Guardiola's starting XI, as Lionel Messi and Co emerged as one of the greatest club sides in history.

With Manchester United struggling defensively this season though, Louis van Gaal may wish to bring Pique back to England.
