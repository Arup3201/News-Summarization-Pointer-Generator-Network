It seems while Chinese men are earning more money, they're also losing more hair.

A quarter of Chinese males are going bald, according to the People's Daily.

If their bald patches were combined together, the size would cover 4,725 square kilometres which is roughly a quarter of Beijing or three times the size of London.

Hair-rising fact: A quarter of the 800 million men in China are getting bald or are already bald, expert says

The new survey, which interviewed 5,779 men from five Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou revealed that 25 per cent of men are losing their hair.

The balding rate among men in China is increasing and the phenomenon is appearing in younger crowds, wrote the People's Daily.

The thinning trend shows more men are losing their hair compared with a previous survey in 2005.

The state-run media also suggested that young and middle-aged men form the majority of China's 'army of balds'. 

The same survey also revealed that 95 per cent of Chinese men with the issue don't seek conventional medical treatments – instead they prefer other ways of treatment such as folk or secret prescriptions.

Lu Jun, the Deputy Secretary of Chinese Medical Doctor Association, said there are approximately 200 million bald and balding males in China.

The survey was conducted after Li Yapeng, a popular actor in China and a former heartthrob, was photographed drinking soup in a restaurant with a balding head.

Analysis: Chinese media attribute the phenomenon to a mix of causes, including stress and irregular lifestyle
