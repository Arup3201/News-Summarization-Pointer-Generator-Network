Alex Goode is poised to make his first England appearance for a year and a first Test start since March 2013, after Mike Brown suffered a setback in his recovery from concussion.

Having been knocked out in an accidental collision with Italy centre Andrea Masi at Twickenham 10 days ago, Brown was expected to come through the return to play protocols in time to retain his No 15 shirt against Ireland in Dublin on Sunday. 

However, the Harlequins full-back experienced concussion symptoms again last Friday, after cycling, so he was forced to begin the whole process from scratch on Monday.

While Stuart Lancaster has not yet ruled Brown out of contention for the crucial encounter between the two remaining unbeaten teams in the RBS Six Nations, all the indications on Monday night were that he would not be available. 

'Mike was symptom-free, then he did the bike on Friday and there were some symptoms after that, so he had to step down again,' said England's head coach. 'He's had a rest over the weekend and started the return-to-play process again today.

'I've got to be 100 per cent certain that he's right with the type of knock it was and also to go into the size of game that this is. The reality is he won't have trained from the (Italy) game to potentially this Friday, which is 13 days. You have to have the team ready to play.

Brown left the field on a stretcher and did not return to the field following his concussion 

'A lot will depend on how the next 24 hours go but a decision will have to be made within the next two days because the team need a chance to prepare with all the pieces in place. It will be a judgement call based on a medical call.' 

Brown seems increasingly likely to miss out and his loss would be keenly felt. He has been an outstanding main-stay of England's recent victories over Wales and Italy.

Goode last played for England on March 9 last year – against Wales at Twickenham – but he has been in fine form for Saracens and Lancaster values his attributes as a playmaker full-back. The 26-year-old hasn't started for his country since the record 30-3 defeat in Cardiff almost two years ago, but his misfortune has been to find himself challenging a man who was untouchable last year, as Brown was named Player of the Championship among a host of personal awards.

'He's been unlucky in the sense that the stand-out player in the Six Nations last year was Mike Brown, in his position. He's had to wait patiently for his chance again. He's certainly confident and he feels he's ready, should his opportunity come, I think he'd be ready to take his chance.

Worcester full back Chris Pennell has also been called into the squad after making his Test debut last June

'He's a different type of player to Mike in that he's equally good under the high ball, he's very good as a positional full-back and he can play fly-half, so he offers that slightly different kicking option, but also the opportunity to be a first receiver-playmaker.'

Worcester full back Chris Pennell has also been called into the squad after making his Test debut last June in New Zealand and more recently playing superbly for the Saxons in Cork. However, Goode is surely destined to take Brown's place in Dublin.

Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood and Geoff Parling are all expected to be available for training on Tuesday after recovering from injuries, and the three forwards are all theoretically in contention for a return to the match-day 23 at the Aviva Stadium. Lancaster is due to name his team on Friday.
