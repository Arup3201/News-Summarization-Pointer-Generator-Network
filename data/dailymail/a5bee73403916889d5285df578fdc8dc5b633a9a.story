Messenger: Dianne Reidy said she was prompted to speak by the Holy Spirit

The stenographer who went on a religious rant in the House of Representatives last night following the debt ceiling vote said that she had been working up the courage to do God's work.

'For the past 2 and 1/2 weeks, the Holy Spirit has been waking me up in the middle of the night and preparing me (through my reluctance and doubt) to deliver a message in the House Chamber,' Dianne Reidy said in a written statement.

'That is what I did last night.'

Reidy's husband Dan said that he was proud of his wife, who he called 'a sweet, level-headed wonderful woman of God'.

Security had to forcibly remove 48-year-old Dianne from the floor and she was taken to hospital for evaluation Wednesday night after she took control of the microphone.

'He will not be mocked. He will not be mocked- don't touch me- He will not be mocked,' she said.

'The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. Had it been it would not have been. It would not have been.

'The Constitution would not have been written by Freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God. Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be to Jesus.'

The woman behind the rant: There is no word yet what prompted Ms Reidy to take control of the mic

According to the New York Post, the married mother makes $126,050 a year.

On her Facebook page, she is a fan of several Christian-oriented groups, including the evangelical In Touch Ministries, led by TV preacher Charles Stanley.

She was interviewed by Capitol Police before being sent to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.

She does not drink, do drugs or have any medication issues, and she has been released from the hospital.

'I’m glad that I fulfilled God’s mission for me, absolutely. It lifted a tremendous burden. It was a very hard burden to carry as you can imagine,' she said in an interview with The Post.

Her husband spoke for the majority of the interview, saying that the late nights that she worked during the shutdown really drove her to the brink.

'God was preparing her for this vote 
last night, because this was kind of the culmination of everything,' her
 husband Dan told The Post.

'This
 was the big one. Everybody’s there. And Dianne didn’t know what she was
 sharing, she didn’t know when — but she just sensed in her spirit.'

Dianne has worked as a stenographer for two decades and the past eight of those years were for the House Clerk- a job she reportedly enjoys because she appreciates the archaic parliamentary order to the ways that laws are passed and debates are organized.

Dan Reidy told The Daily Beast that she takes her job so seriously that she would refuse to call in sick even when she was suffering from morning sickness when pregnant with the couple's twin daughters, but instead she insisted she go to work and bring a bag with her in case she got sick.

She plans to return to work on Tuesday and has not heard from any superiors to the contrary.

'This whole mess has just kind of sickened her to the whole process,' he said of her disgust with what had been going on during the federal shutdown.

'The alliances between people who aren’t really allies. The finger-pointing on the dais, [then] the arms around each other… Where are the people being served in this whole deal?

'She was just like, "Gosh, this is not what it’s about."'

Her
 husband, a video company owner and former director of the far-right 
Great Commission Ministries International, defended his wife’s public 
outburst today: 'My wife is a sweet, level-headed wonderful woman of 
God. I am proud of her.'

The couple is open about their devout religious beliefs.

'Reading a Bible is not foreign to us, but getting up in the middle of the night definitely is. It’s just not a part of our life,' Mr Reidy told the Daily Beast.

'What she was finding out was that God was impressing on her heart that He had a message He wanted her to share with the House of Representatives.'

Attention: Those in earshot of Mrs Reidy could be seen looking at her during the outburst

CSPAN was recording the scene last night and had 
the screen blocked with the breakdown of the vote that had just happened
 to approve the debt ceiling increase and temporary budget agreement.

Though it is not a clear shot, it is still possible to see Reidy approach the microphone and begin gesticulating with her arms.  

People can be heard calling to her, saying the name Molly, but she has been identified in news reports as Reidy.

Politico says that she was removed from the area and taken to a nearby elevator.

A GOP aide told CNN: 'She’s a well-known person, she’s a perfectly nice person, a good colleague, somebody who’s respectable and dependable, and this is very surprising to everybody who works with her. I don't know, she just snapped.'
