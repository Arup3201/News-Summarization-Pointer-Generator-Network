It’s the ultimate bucket list for travellers – the world’s top 25 must-do life experiences showcasing the best of what the planet has to offer.

From watching the Aurora Borealis in Norway, to a boat trip round the Galapagos Islands, the list was created by adventurer Bear Grylls and voted on by 2,000 Brits.

The Wonder List results – which include taking a helicopter tour of Niagara Falls, and riding the Trans-Siberian Railway across Russia – have been released to mark the 25th anniversary of the Discovery Channel.
