An enterprising pair of best friends are launching a range of high-quality unisex watches priced at $95, in hopes of taking on the luxury market.

Chris Chon, a recent MBA graduate from the Kellogg School of Management, and his childhood friend Jeff Leung, both based in New York, had the idea to design their own watches after a frustrating hunt through an industry in which they found it standard for retailers and middle-men to mark watches up by 1,000per cent.

'We started Leonard & Church to create a new way to buy a luxury watch,' the company writes on its Kickstarter page, which has already raised $231,000 in launch funding. 'We want to offer meticulously crafted, handmade luxury watches at a radical price point.'

Time for a new standard: Entrepreneurs Chris Chon and his best friend Jeff Leung have launched Leonard & Church, a line of high-end quality watches priced at a reasonable $95 each (pictured)

According to FastCompany, the founder duo were originally both on the lookout for their own 'first entry-level high-quality watch,' something in the region of $500 to $,1000; from mid-range luxury brands including Movado or Bulova.

'We saw a wide disparity in pricing, even for watches that had the same movement, the same components,' reveals Mr Chon; pointing to brokers, middle-men and high-end retailers as those responsible for the heavy markups.

'The closer we got to the luxury watch industry, the more we were turned off by what we were learning.'

Affordably priced: Leonard & Church (pictured, other watches from its 15-piece range)  hope to stand out with timepieces  that are of the same quality as luxury brands, but without the significant mark-ups

Clean design: The idea struck the founders while they were both on the lookout for their own 'first entry-level high-quality watch,' something in the region of $500 to $,1000, but were put off by the senseless pricing

So the team hit the drawing board, and spent a year with high-ranking designers, manufacturers and key influencers, to arrive at a set of 15 watches priced at only $95, that seek to change the face of the market.

And these founders may be fresh out of business school, but their partners are no novices. According to the company, one of the Leonard & Church manufacturers also produces a watch that President Obama wears in office.

'No middle-men. No retail mark-ups. An obsessive focus on the details,' their campaign reads. 'We're so confident in the quality of our timepieces we are offering a ten year limited warranty on all of our watches.'

Design tweaks: The eclectic range of watches are housed in surgical grade stainless steel cases, and are designed to be extremely thin yet durable (pictured, a work in progress)

Durable: They boast scratch-resistant sapphire crystal lenses, Miyota Quartz movements, are water resistant up to 50 meters, and come with a ten-year guarantee

The eclectic range of watches are housed in surgical grade stainless steel cases, designed to be extremely thin yet durable, boast scratch-resistant sapphire crystal lenses, Miyota Quartz movements, and are water resistant up to 50 meters.

Variations in addition to the smart Chronograph Collection include The Classics; available with leather, tweed or nylon-striped straps, as well as a black-faced option, and the New Classics, which include a stainless steel strap option.

Mr Chon is certainly passionate about his offerings, and based on the success of his Kickstarter campaign - which aimed to raise $75,000, but has raised over three times that amount with nine days left on the clock - Leonard & Church appear well on their way to becoming a storming success.

The company remains committed to avoiding certain partnerships, and opening its own retail store for example, in order to keep their price point 'fairly consistent.'

'If you want to buy a Patek Phillippe watch for $50,000, if that item makes you feel good, that’s great,' Mr Chon remarks. 'But... at a certain point, the watch is what the watch is, and all that premium, all that extra you’re paying for, is the brand name.'
