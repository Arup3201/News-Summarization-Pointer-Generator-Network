Every parent's worst nightmare: Three-year-old Emma Varnadoe is in critical condition after the horrific incident

A three-year-old North Carolina girl was rushed to the hospital Thursday after a lawn mower severed most of her left leg and the foot off her right one.

Emma Varnadoe is in critical condition at Levine Children’s Hospital, in Charlotte, a spokesperson told MailOnline. She is expected to have surgery Saturday.

Grandmother Pam Wade told WSOC that the amputations occurred as she ran to her grandfather as he mowed the backyard on a riding lawnmower and somehow came in contact with the blades.

‘We're asking for prayers,’ she added. ‘Please pray for her recovery.’

The incident occurred around 3.00 p.m. Thursday, according to the station. First responders immediately made the decision to have her taken to Levine, about 35 miles south of Wade’s China Grove home.

Footage from WSOC’s report showed the tractor sitting exactly where it was when it struck the young girl.

The lawnmower severed her left leg off just below the knee and also removed most of her right foot, family told the station.

It appeared to be rounding a tree as the tragic events unfolded, her grandfather may not have seen her running towards him.

A neighbor told the station how hard the incident has been on the close-knit community.

‘Some of us up here [have] not slept all night long,’ said Sherrie Rowell-Monnell.

The woman began crying as she described young Emma.

‘Gorgeous, gorgeous, playful… pretty blonde hair,’ she continued.

She also pleaded with people to be more careful around machinery.

‘Keep your kids, grandkids away from push mowers, riding mowers.’

The hospital declined to provide any further information, and a person who answered the phone at a number listed to the Wades was hung up immediately.
