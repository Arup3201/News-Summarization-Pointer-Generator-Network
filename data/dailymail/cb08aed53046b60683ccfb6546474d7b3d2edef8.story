Controversial televangelist Pat Robertson has caused outrage after telling viewers of his popular talk show that 'homosexuals will die out' - because they can't reproduce.

The former Southern Baptist minister made the comments on The 700 Club, a daily talk show on the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN).

Robertson, who founded CBN, apparently has not considered the options now available to same sex couples should they want to have a baby - nor the fact it is just as likely a straight couple will produce a gay child.

Pat Robertson believes gay people will die out because they cannot reproduce

A video shows the 84-year-old dishing out advice to Crystal, who wrote in worried her church's ban on relationships between the opposite sex was going to leave her and her friends alone.

'I've been in a church all my life but we are not allowed to date,' she wrote.

'The only ones in my church that are married knew their partners before coming in to church. It is treated as a sin to show interest or to have a mutual understanding in church with the opposite sex.'

But Robertson doesn't answer her question directly, instead apparently likening her church's practices to those of 'homosexuals'.

'I know those who are homosexuals will die out, because they do not reproduce. You have to have the heterosexual sex to reproduce,' he says in the video, posted by Right Wing Watch.

'Same thing with this church: it is doomed, it is going to die out. Because it's the most nonsensical thing I have heard in a long time. This is absurd.' 

He continued: 'God has made us to be in families. God has created a desire of men and women to have attraction to the opposite sex so that they will reproduce and have children.

'If I were you, I'd get out of the church as fast as I could, cast the dust of it on your feet, shake off the dust and run.' 

His comments have created anger - and hilarity - on Twitter.

Osbeacher (@osbeacher) called him 'one of the stupidest men alive',  

Benji W ‏(@benjiw) wrote: 'Pat Robertson is just angry that gays are so fabulous it takes two straight people to make one gay person. I predict he'll die out too.'

Ziggy Daddy noted 'Pat Roberston failed biology 101', while Reggie Hammond (‏@allonb) pointed out: 'If it hasn't happened in 6000 years it ain't gonna happen.' 

This isn't the first time Robertson's comments have caused eyebrows to raise.

In January 2013, he told the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man’s infidelity and start doing more to ensure he doesn’t have reason to wander.

In August of that year he was back in the headlines, this time claiming gay men are knowingly spreading the HIV virus while shaking hands with others using a special ring.

He later clarified the comment, saying he only was only talking about gays from ‘years ago,’, not gays today. 

Since establishing the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960, Pat Robertson has been no stranger to controversy.
