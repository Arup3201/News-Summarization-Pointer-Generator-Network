Intelligence officials in Canada are closely monitoring 80 known extremists after they picked up 'chatter' among would-be terrorists plotting ISIS inspired 'knife and gun' attacks against American targets and citizens.

US and Canadian officials have admitted they fear a public beheading or frenzied knife attack and have trained their sights on tracking potential ISIS imitators in Canada targeting the American embassy in Ottawa and an as-yet unspecified shopping mall.

Canadian officials are to increase security at public buildings over the coming days as anxiety grows behind the scenes that a lone wolf terrorist or group will unleash an attack until police arrive to shoot and 'martyr' them.

Officials who have spoken to NBC News said that while the terror chatter online has raised the likelihood of attacks on US citizens inside Canada, there is no suggestion yet that ISIS inspired jihadists have crossed south into America.

They also stressed to NBC News that any possible attacks were currently only being discussed and were at the 'aspirational' stage.

US and Canadian authorities believe that the possibility of an ISIS-style outrage inside the country has been raised by Tuesday's vote in Canada's parliament to join the coalition carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State in Iraq.

'If left unchecked this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly. They have already voiced their local and international terrorist intentions and identified Canada as a potential target,' said Prime Minster Stephen Harper.

The head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Michael Coulombe, said that even though there is no sign of an imminent terror attack inside the country, his agency is taking no chances and that is why they are closely monitoring the 80 or so individuals.

Pressed on the issue, Coulombe said that no charges have been filed because agents are still trying to put together evidence against them, but he stressed, the CSIS 'knows where they are'.

'It does pose a real threat, but like I mentioned, we have no information indicating an imminent attack,' Coulombe told MPs at a House public safety committee in Ottawa on Wednesday.

'We don't want to sound alarmist. We're telling people that they should go about their daily life, but we have to be vigilant,' he said.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner, Bob Paulson, told the same committee that 63 active national security investigations are in progress against 80 or so individuals.

'The pace and tempo of operations is quite brisk,' he said. 'It’s nothing that I think that Canadians need to be alarmed about.'

And, on Tuesday, the SITE Intelligence Group, a private firm that tracks the online activities of Islamic jihadists said it had uncovered a Twitter post that called for attacks on Canada.

The security firm said that it was posted by a known ISIS fighter who they identified as Abu Khalid Al-Kanadi.

When asked if they would be screening people leaving the country, Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney told the committee that they would not.

'Let me be very clear: We are really not contemplating exit controls; we'll leave it to totalitarian states,' Blaney said

He added that Canada and the US currently exchange 'entry' information, which means in other words, entry into one country confirms the exit from the other.
