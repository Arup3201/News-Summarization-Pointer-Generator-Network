The centre of Edinburgh has been transformed into a 'mini war zone' as riot police and a helicopter hunt for a man thought to be on a roof in the city's Old Town.

More than 50 officers wearing balaclavas and shields were deployed to Cockburn Street - near to where a shooting was earlier reported.

Crowds gathered as police, accompanied by sniffer dogs, searched The Scotsman building floor by floor with the chopper circling overhead.
