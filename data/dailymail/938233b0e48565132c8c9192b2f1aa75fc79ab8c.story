Tragic death: Nicholas Wieme, a 23-year-old comedian from Chicago, fell to his death into a scorching smokestack after climbing the top of a landmark hotel to take pictures

What started out as a romantic night on the town in downtown
Chicago ended in a tragedy when a man fell to his death after climbing a
smokestack of a landmark hotel on the Magnificent Mile to take pictures.

The victim, 23-year-old Nicholas Wieme, was
killed Thursday morning after falling 22 feet down a scorching chimney at the
top of the InterContinental Hotel.

According to firefighters, Wieme, who worked as an improv comedian,
climbed onto the dome-shaped roof of the building in the 500 block of Michigan
Avenue to take pictures at around 1am, CBS Chicago reported.

He apparently climbed a ladder along a smokestack to the top
when he fell into the extremely hot shaft, resulting in severe burns throughout
his body.

Wieme then became wedged in an angle of the chimney and was
able to send a text message or a voice mail to his girlfriend, asking for help.

However, it was too late. It took a total of about 125 firefighters
four hours to reach the 23-year-old, which required cutting a hole in the duct
work and sliding him down, according to Fire Chief Michael Fox.

‘It turned very precarious because two feet after we made
the hole was a drop that would have went 42 floors to the basement,’ Fox told NBC Chicago.

Bad decision: Wieme and his girlfriend took an elevator to the top of the InterContinental Hotel and then accessed the roof, which is restricted to the public, via an unlocked door

Immediately after the rescue, fire officials said Wieme was able
to communicate with them before losing consciousness, at which point he stopped
talking. The 23-year-old was rushed in critical condition to Northwestern Hospital,
where he was pronounced dead from his injuries shortly after 5am. 

It all started hours earlier when Wieme, a Minnesota native,
and his girlfriend, Kate Henrikson, went out for dinner and drinks at Michael
Jordan Steak House.

According to officials, following the meal, the young
comedian and his date decided to photograph the view from the top of
the InterContinental Hotel next door to the restaurant.

Larry Langford, a spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department,
told the Chicago Sun-Times that the couple were able to access the roof, which is restricted to the
public, via a door that was not bolted.  

Once on the roof Wieme was able to scale the smokestack
located next to a large observation deck. He thought he had stepped on a ledge,
but plummeted 22 feet before getting stuck in the spot where the chute angled
before dropping 42 floors.

Rescue mission: It took 125 firefighters about four hours to reach Wieme inside the chute and extract him

Risky operation: First responders had to cut a hole into the chimney's duct work and insert wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling further down

Sources said the hotel management shut off the boiler as
soon as they were notified about Wieme’s predicament.  

Rescue crews responded to the hotel at 1.10am after receiving
a report about a person threatening to jump off the roof of the hotel.
Firefighters later learned that a man had fallen into a chimney.

‘We had to send members from the top down on ropes to assess
his condition. The whole time we’re monitoring the situation for toxic gases,’ Chief
Fox said.

Officials said while Wieme was stuck in the six-foot-wide shaft,
he was communicating with his girlfriend, either with phone calls or by
texting, and that firefighters had maintained contact with him until about 3.15am.

Firefighters taking part in the rescue operation cut a hole
in the steel duct work and inserted wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling
400 feet. They then slid him down into the opening and removed him from the
chute. 

Raymond Vermolen, general manager at the InterContinental,
released a statement Thursday morning:

‘The InterContinental Magnificent Mile holds the safety,
comfort and well-being of our guests and employees as our top priority and
concern.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of
the guest at this difficult time. The hotel staff will continue to cooperate
fully with authorities in their investigation.’

Promising career: Wieme had his comedy routines posted on a website and was scheduled to perform Monday at the Cabaret Theater

The Cook County medical examiner's office said Wieme
recently moved from Pipestone, Minnesota, and was living on the North Side of
Chicago.

Wieme was registered with a comedy website, Rooftop
Comedy, which features videos showing the 23-year-old Minnesota State University graduate performing on stage, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. He was scheduled to appear Monday at the iO Improv's Cabaret Theater.

Alumni from iO Improv include such household names as Tina Fey, Mike Meyers and Andy Dick.

Kyja Nelson, a professor at Minnesota State at Moorhead, described Wieme as 'very creative' and 'larger than life.'

'Everything he did, he had fun doing it. That's part of his vibrancy,' Nelson said, adding that the young man had a sharp sense of humor. 

The victim's brother, Jamie, said that it was during college that the English major first became involved in standup comedy, which eventually led him to move to Chicago and pursue a career in improv.
