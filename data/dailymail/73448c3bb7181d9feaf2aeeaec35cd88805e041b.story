Gareth Barry became a Premier League record-breaker during Everton's 1-0 defeat by Stoke City at Goodison Park on Boxing Day.

The 33-year-old midfielder picked up the 100th yellow card of his 17-year, and counting, career in the top flight of English football - more bookings than any other player in Premier League history.

As Barry lunged into a challenge with Steven Nzonzi, referee Lee Mason reached for his pocket to award the former England international his sixth league caution of the season sending him to the top of the all-time Premier League bookings' list, but which serial offenders make up the top-ten?

10. Philip Neville (82 bookings)

Former Manchester United and Everton defender Neville was hardly an angel during his 18-year stint in the Premier League, and he received 82 bookings before retiring.

In 2006, Neville finished the season with the most yellow cards out of any player in the league - 12. 

Three years earlier, the now-BBC pundit was United's most-booked player despite starting just six games. In contrast his brother, Gary, received three yellows to his seven that season.

=8. Wayne Rooney (83 bookings)

Rooney is no stranger to ill discipline. The Manchester United and England captain kindly reminded us of that against West Ham earlier this season, although his hack on Stewart Downing warranted a straight red from Lee Mason.

It was reminiscent of Rooney's sending off in the 2006 World Cup against Portugal for a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho - yet more evidence of repercussions for the 28-year-old's hot-headed decisions.

Eighty-three bookings in the Premier League means Rooney sits joint eighth in the table, for now.

=8. Kevin Nolan (83 bookings)

West Ham's midfielder Nolan is never one to shy away from a challenge, and it shows.

The former Bolton and Newcastle  midfielder is currently level with Rooney on 83 yellow cards - but the duo are the only two players on the list - other than Barry - still playing in the top flight, so expect some movement.

Surprisingly, Nolan is yet to be booked in 14 league appearances this season. Last campaign, though, he registered as many cautions as he did goals - seven.

7. George Boateng (85 bookings)

In Boateng's 13 years in the Premier League, the midfielder received 85 yellow cards.

Coventry City, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Hull City were his clubs between 1997 and 2010, and Boateng  kept his yellow card count up  throughout. It was in that final year he received a second booking for a dangerous challenge on Bacary Sagna after poking Nicklas Bendtner in the eye.

Ten in 1998, and nine apiece in the following two years. Boateng was nothing if not consistent.

6. Robbie Savage (89 bookings)

For a while, Savage held the illustrious position at the top of this most-booked players table. He has since, though, lost his 'dirtiest player in Premier League history' crown and been overtaken.

Savage was, by no means, a stranger to a telling off from a referee. Take the 2003-04 season, for example. The midfielder received 13 yellow cards that year at Birmingham alone.

Two years later, he was cautioned 11 times for Blackburn. That makes the ex-Derby and Leicester player sixth in our list with a total of 89.

5. Scott Parker (92 bookings)

Parker no longer adds to his Premier League tally of 92 as the Fulham midfielder competes in the Championship. Nevertheless, the 33-year-old remains comfortably fifth.

It seems Newcastle brought the aggressive nature out of Parker. The England international was booked nine times in each of his two seasons at St James' Park between 2005 and 2007.

That said, Parker bested that in 2002-03 with Charlton, adding 10 to his still-young tally at the time.

4. Paul Scholes (97 bookings)

The former Manchester United midfielder was not unfamiliar with seeing a referee reach for his pocket. Arguably his most famous yellow card did not arrive in the Premier League, though. 

It came in the semi final of the Champions League. Scholes was cautioned against Juventus, ruling him out of their win in the 1999 final against Bayern Munich  at the Nou Camp.

That rule has since been changed after UEFA announced they will no longer hold suspensions that carry to such European finals. Too little, too late for Scholes, though.

=2. Kevin Davies (99 bookings)

Davies, now a striker for League One club Preston, stayed true to his yellow card nature internationally.

The former Blackburn, Southampton and Bolton goalscorer made his England debut in 2010 as a substitute for Peter Crouch, and was immediately booked.

His place near the top of the list is hardly surprising, given Davies has committed the most fouls in Premier League history, too.

=2. Lee Bowyer (99 bookings)

Bowyer, on the other hand, was far more of a traditional scrapper. Squaring up with fellow players - and on the odd occasion his own Newcastle teammate Kieron Dyer - became a regular occurrence.

The ex-Leeds, West Ham, Newcastle and Birmingham midfielder first season in the Premier League in 1996 saw the aggressive player pick up seven bookings, his last in 2011 finished the same.

Davies and Bowyer will now have to settle for second place on the list after Barry laid sole claim to the title of most Premier League yellow cards.

1. Gareth Barry (100 bookings)

With his booking against Stoke, Barry has moved out on his own and the former Manchester City man is likely to extend his lead at the top of the standings as he continues to play a key role in Everton's midfield. 

In Barry's defence, the 33-year-old sits fifth in the Premier League's all-time appearances list, too, having played more than 500 games for Aston Villa, Manchester City and Everton combined.

Working in the engine room, a yellow card arriving here or there can only be expected.
