A swarm of tornadoes tore through several counties in southern Mississippi and Alabama on Sunday, injuring more than 60 people and ripping apart hundreds of homes and other buildings, including parts of the University of Southern Mississippi, authorities said.

The Forrest County seat of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and the adjacent town of Petal, both about 100 miles southeast of Jackson, the state capital, bore the brunt of storms that struck less than an hour before dark.

The tornado that plowed through the Hattiesburg area was believed to have reached three-quarters of a mile in diameter at times, said Anna Weber, a National Weather Service meteorologist.

The weather service counted three separate twisters in south-central Mississippi on Sunday evening, Weber said.

In neighboring southwestern Alabama, 
authorities reported a flurry of seven tornadoes across three counties, 
including one that damaged 46 homes in Clark County, Weather Service 
meteorologist Keith Williams said.

About 100 houses or more were damaged
or destroyed in Petal, Mississippi, alone, and several businesses were 
hard hit there as well, including a hardware store reduced to rubble, 
Mayor Hal Marx told Reuters.

He said a number of residents 
suffered minor injuries but no one was reported seriously hurt. 'Mostly 
people are just shaken up and in shock,' he said.

More than 60 people were treated for injuries, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said at a news conference 
Monday. No lives were lost and no one was unaccounted for, he said.

Emergency management officials said 
no firm estimates of property losses were immediately available. Power 
outages were widespread.

CNN broadcast photos of several homes
in Hattiesburg badly mangled from the storm, some with roofs and 
exterior walls ripped open.

Emergency management spokesman Greg 
Flynn said a search-and-rescue team from the nearby town of McComb was 
being called in to help look through debris for anyone who might be 
trapped.

On the Hattiesburg campus of the 
University of Southern Mississippi, alma mater of retired National 
Football League star quarterback Brett Favre, the storm damaged several 
buildings, including a performing arts center and an alumni house, the 
university said in a statement.

The twister also heavily damaged a 
high school stadium complex and blew a truck onto the school's baseball 
diamond, officials said.

Kris Walters, 40, a Baptist minister 
for the USM campus, said he and two of his children took shelter in a 
closet with a mattress on top of them until the storm passed, adding 
that his house escaped serious damage.

'I have lived here 40 years, and this is the first tornado I have ever seen like this,' he told Reuters.

Joby Bass, a university professor 
interviewed on CNN, said the porches on his house 'peeled off' and trees
toppled onto his roof as he and his dogs huddled in a closet for 
safety.

'A lot of houses on this street are 
completely roofless,' Bass said. He said the campus was largely empty 
because students had an extended weekend to celebrate Mardi Gras. The 
university said no injuries were reported on campus.

Video footage showed what appeared to
be a large, gray tornado, filmed from a distance, churning through town
as a cloud of debris swirled around it.

Rent, the state emergency management 
spokesman, said Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant had declared a state of
emergency in four Mississippi counties - Forrest, Lamar, Marion and 
Lawrence - and other areas hit by the storms.

The Hattiesburg area also suffered heavy property damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Charlotte Walters, 61, and her daughter Heather Walters, 30, were moving buckets and bowls around inside their house trying to catch water pouring through holes in the roof. The women were at home along with Charlotte's husband when a relative called and said a tornado was headed their way.

'It sounded like Katrina,' said Charlotte Walters, who lives in a neighborhood also hit by the 2005 hurricane that devastated the Gulf Coast.

Besides holes in the roof of her one-story wood frame house, a falling tree had damaged the side and another one collapsed on her carport, denting and breaking windows in three cars there.

'I'm blessed. At least I don't have one of those in my house,' Charlotte said, pointing to a tree that had fallen onto a neighbor's house next door.
