Donald Trump's 'pitbull' adviser is suing a Hamptons homeowner for 'ruining his summer'.

Michael D Cohen rented an $8million Sagaponack mansion from NYU Dr Ali Guy, but says the physiatrist lied to him about the home's state.

When Cohen and his extended family arrived at the home on August 2, they discovered that the air conditioning wasn't working and that half of the rooms were outfitted with too-small twin beds.

Cohen paid $150,000 to rent the home for a month, and is now suing Guy for double, according to a suit filed in Manhattan Superior Court.

'He ruined my summer!' Cohen said, according to the New York Post.

Upsetting: According to the $250,000 lawsuit, the home's air-conditioning was broken and the beds in four of the eight rooms were too small for the visiting adults

Cohen, a Trump Organization Vice President and special counsel to the Donald, says the home is more than double the size of his past rentals since he wanted a large space to house his wife, their two children, his parents, his three siblings, and his siblings' children.

He eventually decided on Dr Guy's eight-bedroom, 12,000-square-foot home because it had enough room 'to accommodate his entire family' and for its 'wow factor,' according to the suit.

According to a real estate listing, the home on Parsonage Lane sits on 1.2 acres and comes with formal living and dining rooms, a great room, screening room, gym, spa, wine cellar, two laundry rooms, pool, three-story elevator and 11.5 bathrooms.

But Cohen says that while the home is aesthetically pleasing, it is non-functional.

Small: One of the biggest issues Cohen has with the home are the too-small twin beds in half of the rooms

Stuck inside: Cohen has also had to spend hours at home, supervising maintenance workers trying to repair the air-conditioning, missing out on family time

Bad surprise: The home's sauna and security gate have also had issues that were specified when Cohen agreed to rent the home for $150,000

The home has had multiple issues that has tainted Cohen's summer and made it nearly uninhabitable for his family, who came all the way from California and Florida for a reunion.

One of the biggest issues was the twin beds in four of the eight rooms - too small for his 6-foot-tall teen soon or his married sisters. 

He says the broker was forced to buy two big beds with mattresses, box springs and frames just to 'make things right'.

Cohen also found that the sauna was broken, the security gate malfunctioned and the toilets were busted. 

Even worse - the air-conditioning wasn't working in two of the bedrooms.

When
 he confronted Guy about the air-conditioning issues in the heat of 
summer, the landlord told him to open the windows at night and 'hope for
 sea breeze' even though the house isn't on the beach.

Contractors
 were called out to the house to fix the AC, but were unsuccessful. 
While they worked Cohen was stuck in the house supervising, missing out 
on time with his family.

Dr Guy has spoken out about the suit and told the Post Cohen's complaints are 'completely unfounded'.

'He wants to sue me for $250,000 and his rent was $150,000' Dr Guy said.

'We are filing a response, and I feel I will be vindicated,' he added.

Cohen has been called Trump's 'pitbull' and has been given the nicknqame 'Tom' in reference to The Godfather character.
