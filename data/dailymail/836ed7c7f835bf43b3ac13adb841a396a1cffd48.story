It's easy to while away the hours on the web, but when you've got work to do, the likes of Facebook and YouTube are an unwelcome distraction.

To help procrastinators stay focused, a pair of designers has added a modern twist to the traditional typewriter so people can still save their work online, but without the interruptions. 

Named Hemingwrite, the 'digital typewriter' uses Wi-Fi to save files to the cloud, but doesn't come with email, a web browser or Facebook.

The Hemingwrite (pictured) is described by its Michigan designers as a ‘minimalist digital typewriter for distraction-free writing’. It has an e-ink display and saves documents to cloud storage, such as Dropbox, but the Wi-Fi enabled processor doesn’t have a web browser, Facebook or email

It was created by Michigan-based Adam Leeb and Patrick Paul and launched on Kickstarter.  

‘The Hemingwrite is a minimalist digital typewriter for distraction free writing composition,' explained the pair. 

‘It combines the simplicity of a typewriter with modern technology like an electronic paper screen and cloud backups to create the best possible writing experience.’

The inventors said that because the Hemingwrite doesn’t allow access to the web, it helps people work more efficiently.

Hemingwrite was created by Michigan-based Adam Leeb and Patrick Paul and launched on Kickstarter. They claim the battery on the word processor will last for more than four weeks. The first batch of pre-orders, initially available from Kickstarter for $349 (£299), sold out and these orders will be shipped in September

The inventors said that because the Hemingwrite doesn’t allow access to the web, it helps people work more efficiently. They have not announced exactly when the typewriter (pictured) will go back on sale, but it is expected to retail for $499 (£328) at some point ‘later this year’

Forget the bells and whistles of today’s smartphones, these high-tech models are being abandoned in favour of the flip and ‘brick’ style devices of the 1980s and 90s.

Celebrities including Anna Wintour, Rihanna and Kate Beckinsale have all been spotted on vintage handsets in recent months.

So much so, there are now even crossover devices designed to look like retro handsets but with many of the functionalities of modern-day smartphones.

And it’s not just smartphones that are being ditched in favour of older gadgets.

Last month, reports said celebrities are also switching digital cameras for Polaroids following Apple’s iCloud leak. 

Sales of Polaroid cameras, which were particularly popular in the 1980s, and produce a developed film image, have risen by around three quarters in less than a year.

The device includes a mechanical keyboard, an e-ink display that can be read in daylight, and access to cloud storage such as Dropbox and Google Drive.

Its makers also claim the battery on the Wi-Fi enabled, portable word processor will last for more than four weeks. 

The first batch of pre-orders, initially available from Kickstarter for $349 (£299), sold out, and these orders will be shipped in September.

The campaign ran until the 23 January and raised $342,471 (£224,400) of its $250,000 (£164,540) goal.

Its makers have not announced exactly when the typewriter will go back on sale, but it is expected to retail for $499 (£328) at some point ‘later this year.’

‘We’re proud of the prototype units we’ve developed and are excited to move into production in 2015,’ said Mr Leeb.

‘We have lined up a leading manufacturing group to partner with on the 2015 Hemingwrite model and are ready to move swiftly after completing our Kickstarter presale.

‘Our first priority for the software feature set is to deliver a great user experience for writers,’ added Mr Paul.

‘The 2015 Hemingwrite will ship with a minimalist interface but we will also support a development kit (SDK) to fulfill the needs of more specialized professionals like screenwriters.’
