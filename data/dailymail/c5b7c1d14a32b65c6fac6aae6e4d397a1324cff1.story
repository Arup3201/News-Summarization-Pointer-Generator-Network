The brain damaged 16-year-old girl who miraculously survived a deadly axe-attack which killed three of her family has regained consciousness.

Marli van Breda has recovered the ability to blink in response to questions which police believe  could be vital to finding the killers.

Attackers left the South African teenager bleeding to death on the balcony of her family's home in Stellenbosch after cutting her throat and inflicting 'severe' head injuries, the Times reports.

Ms Breda's mother Teresa, 54, was found dead on the balcony and police discovered her deceased father Martin, 55, and brother Rudi, 22, in a bedroom.

Her other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang the police to report the deaths at his home - around 30 miles east of Cape Town on January 27.

An audio recording of the five-minute phonecall, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal Henri van Breda 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody attack.

'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.'

When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard.

A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack.

The young man's mental health has been under speculation since Monday when News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were revealed to have been negative and no further testing occurred.

The Times reports his uncle Her Breda, who is caring for the 20-year-old, says his nephew is heart-broken.

He denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply hidden from the media's gaze.

Mr Breda added: 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family.

'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.'

No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli is believed to be in a stable condition in hospital - but both family and friends have been barred from her bedside.

She is understood to have undergone brain surgery after the attack and is being closely monitored by doctors, while police provide round-the-clock guard.

Her uncle Her Breda said: 'I received a call this morning and they were asking for permission to move her from intensive care unit into a bigger ward, where they will start with physical training.

'What happened was something we had not envisaged, but it is in God's hands.' 

Devastated friends who knew the family in Australia paid tribute to the axe attack victims last week.

Brothers: Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries

The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014.

Rudi's friends have been leaving tributes on social media, with his university friend Afif Norzal saying: 'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend.

'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.'

Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he returned to university for the final year of his Masters of Engineering.

Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview: 'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me.

'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate. He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' 

A spokesman for the University of Melbourne released a statement saying: 'A Dean's honours list member for Science in 2011, Rudi was a keen sportsman and was highly regarded amongst his peers as a good-natured and friendly person, someone who was always willing to lend a hand and help out younger students.' 

Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-2014. He had been living at Trinity College where his brother was staying while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth.

Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia: 'Teresa was a lovely mother... She was so happy all her children were with her, the boys had came from Australia (to visit).

'Henri moved back to South Africa in the middle of last year and he stayed with his family. She loved having him with her. She always used to tell me how wonderful it was.' 

Her husband Martin was the managing director of Engel and Voelkers Australia, an international property firm which has offices in Perth and Queensland. Friends described him as a 'great man' with a bright future ahead of him.

Peter Armitage tweeted: '(He) was going to change SA (South Africa)... Folks, live for today. Tell people you love them today.'

Mr Armitage said Martin was the founder of Netstar and Woodhill College. Martin's golf club also paid their 'deepest condolences' to the family on Twitter.

Paul Freney, a friend and colleague of Martin's at Engel and Voelker,  told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife Teresa were committed parents to their three children.

'Committed parents' The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia

He said: 'I heard about it yesterday. A mate of mine rang me up and I nearly fell off my chair.

'They were very nice people. Martin loved his rugby. He was an avid Force supporter from Western Australia. We used to go to the rugby together, he loved his golf.'

'Teresa... looked after the business of running the home and all that sort of stuff, and I imagine had a fair bit to do.'

'He was a very intelligent man and he was obviously very wealthy, had a lot of money, but it was all earned through his own endeavours.'   

The van Breda family spent several years living in the Perth suburb of Claremont. Around 2012 they moved to the Sunshine Coast, where Engels and Volker had an office. 

Ms Dutton, whose daughter is close friends with Marli, said she last saw the family on January 2 in South Africa. She said they were a 'very, very happy family'.  

A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family'

Marli was enrolled at Matthew Flinders Anglican College at Buderim while she was in Year 9. A school spokesman said the community was 'very sad to hear the tragic news'.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Marli, her family and those who love her,' the spokesman said.  

She is currently a student at Somerset College in South Africa.  

The school's headmistress Meg Fargher, described the Year 11 student as a  'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were very involved in the school, news24 reported. 

Both schools are providing access to counsellors for students.  

Emergency medical services spokesman Robert Daniels told reporters it was obvious that the victims were attacked with an axe.

'What I can say is they were not shot, the patients were axed,' Mr Daniels told the Cape Times. 'The daughter was rushed to hospital with severe head trauma and a severed jugular.

He said Henri was treated at the scene for minor bruises on his arms. 

Family friend Alexander Boshoff, 19, described the Van Bredas' as a 'typical happy family', according to South African news reports. 'Our families often spent holidays together. We have known each other for years,' he said.

Mr Boshoff said the family moved around a lot due to Martin's work but the boys never complained and then added that they were 'like a perfect family'.

A special memorial service open to the public will be held at 5pm on Thursday February 5 for the van Breda family at Marli's former Queensland school - Matthew Flinders Anglican College­.
