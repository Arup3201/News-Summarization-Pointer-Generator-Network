Craig McNulty died in August last year after falling from a tree. A coroner gave a verdict of accidental death and said he believed Mr McNulty had blacked out before the fall

A roofer who fell to his death while pruning a tree had weaned himself off medication for vertigo, an inquest heard.

Craig McNulty landed on his feet on the concrete below the tree before falling back and hitting his head, suffering 'catastrophic' injuries on August 1 last year.

He had been helping his partner's father to cut branches at her sister's home.

Mr McNulty, 38, had been prescribed medication for vertigo after a previous fall from 12ft-high scaffolding in 2011.

He told doctors he was worried because he had felt dizzy and blacked out.

Bradford Coroner's Court heard that Mr McNulty, a father-of-one, had been referred to a neurologist and given his vertigo diagnosis.

At a follow-up appointment in February 2012, he reported that he had felt dizzy and blacked out again while picking something up in the shower.

Mr McNulty, of Batley, West Yorkshire, was advised 'to stop working at heights' and to stop driving.

By June last year, he 'admitted he had weaned himself off the medication and said he never felt better.'

Deputy coroner Oliver Longstaff said nobody knew why Mr McNulty had done this, but it was possible he wanted to get his driving licence back.

There was no evidence Mr McNulty had tried to break his fall to save himself, said Acting Detective Inspector Matt Hawke. 

Passing a verdict of accidental death, Mr Longstaff said: 'It seems to 
me more likely than not that Mr McNulty had blacked out again before he 
fell.'

He added that he did not need to resolve whether the blackout was related to not taking the medication.

Speaking after his death last year, Mr 
McNulty's partner of 15 years, Sharon McNulty, said: 'Craig was the most
generous, giving person you could ever meet.

'He was always doing something for 
somebody and worked for the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, 
helping troubled youngsters achieve a trade.

‘He spent all his time making other people happy and hopefully we’ll be able to carry that on.

Mr McNulty had been prescribed vertigo medication after a fall in 2011 but had stopped taking it by June 2012

'He was always doing something for somebody. You'd ask him to do something and five minutes later he would be doing it.'

The family has raised more than £1,000 for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, which flew Mr McNulty to hospital, since his death.

They also opened their cafe in Dewsbury on Christmas Day to carry out Mr McNulty's plan to serve dinner to 50 homeless people.
