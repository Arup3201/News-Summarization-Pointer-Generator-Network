An unlicensed driver accused of killing a 4-year-old while fleeing police last year has again been charged with a crime behind the wheel — this time injuring a police officer while bolting from a weekend traffic stop, authorities said.

Franklin Reyes, 18, made an illegal turn Sunday evening and refused to put the SUV in park when an officer asked him to, police said.

One officer had reached through a passenger-side window to try to put the vehicle in park when Reyes sped off, and the officer was dragged about a block. 

The New York Daily News reported the police officer, identified as Edward O'Connell, was led 100 feet by Reyes' vehicle and that his elbow and wrist were injured.

Reckless: Police say Franklin Reyes made an illegal turn Sunday evening and refused to put the SUV in park when an officer asked him to - then sped off, dragging the officer 100 feet with him 

Not the first crime: Reyes reportedly struck and killed Ariel Russo, pictured, in a driving accident last June 

The young driver hit a second car and sped off, The News reported.

Police said Reyes was arrested after he ditched the car in a parking garage and hid in the office.

'When I attempted to arrest the defendant, he refused to put his hands behind his back, swung his arms up and down, and kicked his legs,' Officer Richard Natal said in a police report obtained by the newspaper.

His lawyer didn't immediately return a message from the Associated Press seeking comment.

The New York Post revealed Reyes' lawyer Martin Schmukler said 'His mother had driven him to the home of a relative. She left the vehicle behind to go somewhere else.'

'The other occupants of the home left...and the defendant, feeling lonely and by himself, felt the best thing he could do was just simply take the car and go home,' he continued. 'His better judgement failed him and he got into the car.'

The Manhattan district attorney's office said Reyes was being held without bail after his arraignment on assault and other charges and is due back in court Friday. 

Reyes is awaiting trial on a manslaughter charge in the death of Ariel Russo last year.

Heartbroken: Ariel Russo's parents, Sofia and Alan Russo, were outraged following the discovery Reyes was behind the wheel again 

Robbery: Reyes has also been accused of taking jewelry, cash and wine from a dead woman's apartment

Authorities said he had taken his parents' car without permission and was fleeing officers who were trying to stop him from driving erratically.

The SUV jumped a curb and hit a building, pinning Ariel and striking her grandmother, who survived.

Russo's mother, Sofia Russo, told The New York Daily News 'I keep having this nightmare over and over that [my son] Jacob ... and I get hit by a car — and it’s [Reyes] driving.'

'It’s just this terrible nightmare I have over and over,' Reyes continued. 'And it’s like it came true — he did something again!'

Reyes has also been accused of taking jewelry, cash and wine from a dead woman's apartment in July. His attorney has said that Reyes denies taking anything and was helping his father, the building superintendent, with a plumbing leak. Reyes' father was charged with similar crimes.

Altogether, the merchandise was worth at least $19,000, The Post reported.

The judge overseeing Reyes' cases had offered the teen a deal where he'd receive a maximum of four years behind bars in Russo's death and the chance to have his case eventually sealed.He faced up 15 years in prison if convicted at trial. It's unclear if his latest arrest will affect the proposal.

Sanford Rubenstein, an attorney for Ariel Russo's parents, said Wednesday that the family was outraged.

'That offer should be revoked. He should stand trial in every case that he has,' Rubenstein told the Associated Press.
