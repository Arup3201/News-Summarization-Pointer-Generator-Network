A 'hidden planet' outside our solar system has been detected by looking for 'bumps' in the orbits of its neighbours - a technique first used by astronomers 150 years ago.

The method, developed by French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier, was used to predict the existence of Neptune. This is the first time it's been used outside the solar system.

As with Neptune, although the Saturn-sized planet around star KOI-872-0 is invisible, scientists realised it must be there because of tiny effects which could only be caused by its gravity.

More than 150 years ago Le Verrier predicted Neptune's existence based on small deviations in the motion of Uranus

More than 150 years ago Le Verrier predicted Neptune's existence based on small deviations in the motion of Uranus.

Dr David Nesvorny, of the Southwest Research Institute, used the same 'gravitational perturbation theory' using NASA's Kepler telescope and was rewarded by the discovery of a distant planet.

Writing in journal Science he said: ‘Today's telescopes are detecting planets around distant stars, and NASA's Kepler Telescope, launched in 2009, is a champion among them.’

The telescope works by monitoring the brightness of 150,000 stars, which appear slightly dimmer when a planet passes, or transits, in front fo them.

Such a transit should adhere to strict unchanging laws and a 'Keplerian orbit' around the star - unless its gravity is being effected by an unknown object.

Dr Nesvorny said: ‘It quickly became apparent to us that a large hidden object must be pulling on the transiting planet.

Deviations of the orbit of a known planet in front of the star have shown there is another, previously undetected, planet there

Dr Nesvorny's team were studying a the Sun-like star - as KOI-872 0 - and noted that it showed transits with remarkable time variations over two hours.

Co author Dr David Kipping said: ‘For a planet following a strictly Keplerian orbit around its host star, the spacing, timing and other properties of the observed transit light curve should be unchanging in time.

‘Several effects, however, can produce deviations from the Keplerian case so that the spacing of the transits is not strictly periodic.’

It is the first time the method, developed by French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier, has been used to find a planet so far away.

‘To put this in context, if a bullet train arrives in a station two hours late, there must be a very good reason for that. The trick was to find what it is.’

By using Le Verrier's theory to speed up calculations of configurations of planetary orbits, the team showed that the variations could be best explained by an unseen planet about the mass of Saturn that orbits the host star every 57 days.

Dr Kipping said: ‘Whilst the principal goal of the HEK project will continue to focus on searching for moons, this first planetary system discovered by HEK demonstrates the unexpected discoveries possible with transit analysis.’To put this in context, if a bullet train arrives in a station two hours late, there must be a very good reason for that.
