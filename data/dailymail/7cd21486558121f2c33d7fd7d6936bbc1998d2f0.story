Teenagers' addiction to communicating online has been revealed by a new report which found one in ten now boast more than 1,000 Internet ‘friends’.

A study of 200 14-to-18-year-olds in 55 schools found three-quarters had 200 or more Facebook and Twitter followers, while a third had more than 500. Almost half of those questioned admitted they had never met a quarter of their online acquaintances.

The findings have prompted fears that they risk damaging their 'real-life' relationships.

Addicts: Experts have warned teenagers' obsession with social networking sites could affect their 'real-life' relationships

Changing status: Experts said social networking sites like Twitter are creating a new definition of friendship

Some pupils even claimed social networking had become so addictive that their social lives ‘fail to exist any more’, the study by education providers MB Learning Solutions found.

Neurologist Baroness Greenfield, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University, said: ‘If they’re keeping in touch with 200 people, it means the time they’re taking to do that is time not spent rehearsing real-life communication. Their social skills and ability to relate to others will suffer.’

The report by education providers MB Learning Solutions says ‘by no means all of these are real relationships’, adding that almost half of teenagers in its survey said they had never met a quarter of their online followers.

Baroness Greenfield warned that young people are in danger of losing their ability to empathise with others because of their over-use of social networking sites.

The report quoted students as saying that social networking was so addictive that friends ‘weren’t as social as they used to be’ and their ‘actual social lives fail to exist any more’ 

Warning: Expert neuroscientist baroness Greenfield said teenagers' social skills and empathy could suffer from too much time communicating online

Baroness Greenfield, professor of 
pharmacology at Oxford University, said that teenagers may have 200 
‘contacts’, but they could not possibly be close friends.

She
said: ‘If the majority are keeping in touch with 200 people it means 
the time they’re taking to do that is time not spent rehearsing face to 
face contact or real life communication. There’s only 24 hours in a 
day.'

She said it ‘would be a great shame’ if young people thought friendship was merely being able to say ‘you’re thumbs up’ or ‘thumbs down’.

She said: ‘Their social skills and ability to relate to others will also suffer.

‘It might mean that your identity’s much more fragile if it needs constant feedback and constant approval from others.

‘It might also mean you develop a rather idealised identity that’s not you and therefore in the end you become more miserable as a result because ‘no-one really understands you’.

‘It also has implications for empathy. We all know that words are only about ten per cent of the impact you have when you talk to someone. There’s also eye contact, body language and physical touching.

‘But when would a young kid learn to do that if they’re communicating through several hundred friends? When would you learn when to put your arm around someone, how it’s appropriate or how to establish eye contact?’

Sue Palmer, literacy expert and author of books including Toxic Childhood, said that social networking sites are creating a new definition of friendship.

She said: ‘For many people it’s just a good way of keeping in touch with a few chums or family but for quite a number of young people, it’s a status thing.

‘It’s a PR exercise. You have to wonder why they need to claim so many friends.’

Dr Helen Wright, former headmistress of top girls’ school St Mary’s Calne in Wiltshire, said: ‘You can’t possibly have 600 real friends and be the best in those friendships. Friendships need to be cherished and this isn’t the message that young girls are getting.

‘If it’s possible in just a moment to defriend someone or unfriend them on Facebook, then people say ‘why can’t I do that in real life?’ But of course, it’s not like that, life is not like that.’
