His marriage crumbled last summer. He was hospitalized for a blood clot in his leg earlier this year. His son died of a tragic drug overdose in March. It has been a rough year for 'The Nature Boy' Ric Flair - and it just got worse.A judge in North Carolina issued an arrest warrant for the former professional wrestling champion earlier this month after he failed to pay more than $32,000 in spousal support to his ex-wife Jacqueline Beems.Beems is Flair's fourth wife - and his fourth EX-wife.

Part of the former couple's separation agreement stipulates that Flair is to pay Beems about $4,000 a month to help her pay for things like her car, health insurance and legal fees. But Flair is yet to make a payment, so on July 3, a warrant was issued for his arrest.

'The reason I didn’t pay my ex-wife the 32 grand is because my son died 
and I was in the hospital for a month,' Flair tells the Charlotte Observer. 'I was in the 
hospital for a month with a blood clot. I didn’t go to work for three 
months.'

Flair's son Reid was found dead in a Charlotte hotel room where Flair had temporarily been living on March 29. Toxicology reports showed that Reid had consumed a fatal combination of heroin and prescription drugs.

Adding to the drama are the former wrestlers accusations that Beems has been harassing his new girlfriend, a claim Beems denies.

On Tuesday, Beems turned herself in to authorities and was charged with a misdemeanor count of making harassing phone calls. Beems' attorney, Brad Smith, calls the accusations 'unfounded and outlandish.'

Flair says his Beems threatened the woman.

'My girlfriend Wendy Kidder is the mother of four and she has 50 texts 
and five phone (voice-)mails from my ex-wife,' Flair says. 'They didn’t 
give Wendy a warrant for arrest without looking at all of that stuff.'

The reason for the divorce, Beems claims in court filings, is Flair's philandering ways. She claims Flair 'has had numerous intimate relationships with other women during the 
parties’ marriage to the embarrassment and humiliation of wife.'

The couple was married in November 2009, and it didn't take long before the newlyweds hit a rough patch.

In February 2010, police were called to the couple's home in south Charlotte for a domestic violence complaint. Beems was charged with misdemeanor assault in the brouhaha, but the charges were later dropped for lack of evidence.

Flair can avoid jail time if he pays Beems $32,352.51, which he tells the Observer he plans to do today.
