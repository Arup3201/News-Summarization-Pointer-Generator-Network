A shocking 84 percent of vegetarians eventually return to eating meat, according to a new study.

The Humane Research Council conducted the survey of over 11,000 adults with varied diets and found that not only did most vegetarians go back to eating meat, only two per cent of Americans are vegetarians.

The study also found that 88 per cent have never tried vegetarianism or veganism.

Out of the 12 percent of Americans who have chosen carrots over cow, five out of six people return to being carnivores.

Not just vegetables: A shocking 84 per cent of vegetarians have returned to eating meat, according to a new research study by the Humane Research Council

Their stories of how they went back to their meat eating lifestyle vary from accidental tastings to cataclysmic cravings. Some say their diet was no match to the taste of fried chicken.

'I was a vegetarian until this one time I drank whiskey and ate a piece of bacon at 4 a.m.,' Chelsea Qualls, 24, told The New York Daily News.

Prior to this meatful night she was a vegetarian for four years.

'I took a bite of my friend's pizza, which happened to have bacon, and then the next morning we went to brunch, and I ordered more bacon because it was delicious,' said Qualls.

Qualls ate nothing but noodles, rice, and vegetables during her stint as a vegetarian and she missed the dining rituals associated with meat.

'I missed out on FOUR delicious Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners!' she said. 'It was a sad time.'

Interestingly enough the study shows that half of vegetarians who went back to eating meat did it for their partners.

'I did it for love,' Harlem actor and comedian Andrew Kimmer, 31, told The New York Daily News.

He says that when his wife had to eat meat for medical reasons he started eating meat again.

'It’s always the woman’s fault,' he joked.

Kimmer said his love of Italian cuisine also pushed Kimmer back to eating antipasti.

While vegetarians go back to eating meat they don't always eat all types of meat. 

While 'everything' tastes like chicken, vegetables don't and former vegetarians can’t stop putting poultry in their mouths.

'Chicken is the most common type of meat consumed by former vegetarians/vegans, ‘the study group reported.

Feed me now: Nutritionist Lisa Young told The New York Daily News that cravings are the number one thing making vegetarians and vegans meat eaters again and mostly because they quit meat cold turkey

'Reducing and eliminating chicken consumption will have the greatest impact on the number of farmed animals’ lives saved.'

Katie Busch, 27, told The New York Daily news that she craved the meat in a McDonald’s Happy Meal.

She became a vegetarian at age 10 and went back to meat at 25.

'I really missed Chicken fingers, probably because I went vegetarian at age 10, so I’d never had most ‘adult’ meats,' says Busch.

'I went back because meat was delicious ... and at that point I realized I’m going to hell for other reasons — may as well give up the ghost and embrace the dark side.'

Nutritionist Lisa Young told The New York Daily News that cravings are the number one thing making vegetarians and vegans meat eaters again and mostly because they quit meat cold turkey.

'They say, "I’m never going to eat that again,"' says Young, cautioning against the all-or-nothing approach.

'If you start by eating smaller portions of pork or chicken, then cutting out all meat and dairy for a month, you can get a better feel for it,' says Young.

When Kathleen Curtis, 23, watched a PETA video she stopped eating meat for moral reasons but the cravings became too strong.

She indulged in a bacon-filled hamburger on Friday and hasn’t gone back since.

'It was the best decision I've ever made,' adds Curtis.

Those animal rights groups whose salad is tossed out of place upon hearing the news might be comforted by the fact that 37 per cent of ex-vegetarians want to stop eating meat in the future.
