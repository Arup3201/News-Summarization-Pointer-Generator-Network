Tottenham are closing on a £4million deal for Sporting Lisbon centre-back Eric Dier.

The 20-year-old was born in Cheltenham but moved to Portugal with his family when he was ten years old. He was picked up by Sporting scouts and has advanced through their academy to break into their first team.

Newcastle and West Ham have also been showing interest in the England U21 international but Tottenham have stepped in and are primed to sign him over the coming days if negotiations go well.

Lisbon: Eric Dier is signing for Spurs as Mauricio Pochettino looks to boost his defensive options

Dier, the grandson for former FA secretary Ted Croker, had a loan spell at Everton in 2011 but he never got the chance to make an impression on the first team.

He returned to Sporting and made 15 first team appearances last season.

Tottenham meanwhile are maintaining interest in Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez with Schneiderlin making it known he wishes to join them before the transfer window closes.
