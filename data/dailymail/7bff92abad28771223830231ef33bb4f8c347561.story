The families of some of the 22 Indian primary school pupils who died after eating a school lunch contaminated with pesticides have buried the children in the school playground in protest at 'government negligence'.

Police have arrested the school cook following the poisoning which may have been part of a political feud between two branches of the same family, a local police chief said.

Nearly 50 people, the majority of whom were young children, became sick at the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar after eating the food. Almost half died.

The incident in the town of Mailsi in Punjab province followed recent provincial elections in which Arsal Khan Khichi lost to his cousin Jehanzaeb Khan Khichi, police chief Sadiq Dogar said late Thursday.

Investigators believe that mustard oil used in the cooking had been contaminated with organophosphate pesticides.

Several of the parents buried their children in front of the school yesterday.

Madav Ram, whose 12-year-old son Rahul was one of the children who died, told the Daily Telegraph: We decided to bury our children in front of the school building to remind the government that they died because of their negligence.

'We also plan to raise a memorial in the memory of the dead children inside the school.'

Arsal Khan Khichi is accused of paying
a cook, Mohammad Rafiq, 50,000 rupees ($500) to poison food at his 
rival's home on June 9, Dogar said. Nearly 50 people became sick and 
were taken to the hospital, and 22 died. Jehanzeb Khan Khichi was not at
home when the incident occurred, Dogar said.

Rafiq has confessed to poisoning the 
food, Dogar said. Police waited to arrest him until they received 
medical reports that confirmed the dead had been poisoned. Arsal Khan 
Khichi is still on the run, and a murder case has been registered 
against him as well, Dogar said.

Politics are often a family affair in 
Pakistan, where it is not uncommon to have members of the same clan 
running against each other as members of rival political parties.

It comes as it was claimed the 
headmistress of the school is on the run, as police 
claim she forced a reluctant cook to serve up the food.

Authorities say the cook had warned 
Meena Devi, head of the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar, that
the cooking oil may have been contaminated.

She had complained that the oil looked strange and gave off a foil smell when heated, but her concerns were dismissed.

'The headmistress said "continue cooking and serve the food to the children",' said Police Superintendent Sujeet Kumar.

It is thought that many of the children who ate the meal may have been saved had the headmistress tasted the food before it was served, as required under the rules of the Midday Meal Scheme.

Children are said to be far more vulnerable to this type of poisoning than adults as they have low body weight.

Soon
after the potato curry and rice was served at the school in rural 
Chappra, Bihar, one of India's poorest states, pupils started 
complaining of stomach cramps, then began to vomit and collapse.

Ninety
minutes later, the first victim, named as four-and-a-half year old Anshu Kumar, died on the way to hospital. Death came
so quickly for some that they died in their parents' arms while being 
taken to hospital.

Dozens of other children are being treated for food poisoning.

Authorities
discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next 
to the vegetable oil and mustard oil, but it wasn't yet known if that 
container was the source, said Amarjeet Sinha, a top official in Bihar.

'It's
not a case of food poisoning. It's a case of poison in food in a large 
quantity, going by the instant deaths,' Mr Sinha said.

More answers are expected on Friday, 
when a forensic laboratory is to issue the results of its tests on the 
dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the 
headmistress in her house, he said.

Police were searching for the principal, who fled after the students started falling sick, Sinha said.

Local farmer Ajay Kumar's 5-year-old daughter was among the victims. He was in his house, which is about 100 metres from the school, when he heard screams from neighbours saying the children had fallen ill.

'I rushed there and all the kids were on their backs or clutching their stomachs or vomiting. I picked up my girl and took her to the local hospital right away,' Ajay said.

Parents hitched rides or took public transport to get to the hospital, which is about nine miles from the village, he said.

Medical staff told them they had no medicines to give them. His daughter died shortly afterwards, writhing in pain on the floor.

When Reuters visited the village, there were at least 18 burial mounds, many in a large field opposite the school. Some contained multiple bodies and villagers could not agree on how many children were buried in them.

Many parents said they buried their children's toys and clothes in the graves.

The
cooks, Manju Devi and Pano Devi, told The Associated Press that the 
principal controlled the food for the free daily lunch provided by the 
government at the school.

She
gave them rice, potatoes, soy and other ingredients needed to prepare 
the meal for Tuesday lunchtime and then went about her business. As the 
children ate, they started fainting, the cooks said.

The two cooks were not spared either.

Manju Devi, 30, ate some of the food and fainted. Her three children, ages five, eight and 13, fell ill as well. All were in stable condition Thursday.

While Pano Devi, 35, didn't eat the tainted food, her three children did. Two of them died and the third, a four-year-old daughter, was in the hospital.

'I will stop cooking at the school,' she said. 'I am so horrified that I wouldn't grieve more if my only surviving child died.'

Mr Sinha said one of the cooks told authorities that the cooking oil appeared different than usual, but the principal told her to use it anyway.

Doctors treating the children said they suspected the food had been contaminated with insecticide.

Media reports said the cooking oil may have been stored in an old pesticide container, but there was no independent confirmation of this.

'The minute the children were brought in, we smelled this foul odour of organophosphorus,' said Dr. Vinod Mishra, a doctor in the medical team treating many of the children at Patna Medical College Hospital in Bihar's capital, Patna.

Organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, which are widely available and are sold under a variety of different brands.

Treatment: The meal was cooked in the school kitchen, but school authorities stopped serving it as children started vomiting

The free midday meal was served to the
children Tuesday in Gandamal village in Masrakh block, 50 miles north 
of Patna, the Bihar state capital.

Those
who survived the poison were unlikely to suffer from any serious after 
effects from the tainted food, said Patna Medical College hospital 
superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar.

'There
will be no remnant effects on them. The effects of poisoning will be 
washed after a certain period of time from the tissues,' Mr Amar said.

He
said that the post-mortem reports on the children who died confirmed 
that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil. He said 
authorities were waiting for lab results for more details on the 
chemicals.

Location: It was not immediately clear how chemicals ended up in the food in a school in Masrakh, near Patna in Bihar, although one official said the food may not have been properly washed before it was cooked

India's midday 
meal plan is one of the world's biggest school nutrition programs. State
governments have the freedom to decide on menus and timings of the 
meals, depending on local conditions and availability of food rations.

It
was first introduced in the Sixties in southern India, where it was 
seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school.

Since
then, the program has spread across the country, covering some 
120million schoolchildren. It's part of an effort to address concerns 
about malnutrition, which the government says nearly half of all Indian 
children suffer from.

Although
there have been complaints about the quality of the food served and the
lack of hygiene, the incident in Bihar appeared to be unprecedented for
the massive food program.
