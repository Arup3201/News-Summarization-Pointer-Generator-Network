Skins star Kaya Scodelario broke up with her Shameless actor boyfriend after he threw a trainee plumber from his bonnet during a late-night row, a court heard.

The claim was made today in the High Court, where actor Elliott Tittensor is being sued for £300,000  by 'victim' Oliver Flint - who was left brain-damaged and blind in one eye by the 2010 incident.

Mr Flint and the actor, who played Carl Gallagher in Channel 4's Shameless, clashed outside a McDonald's in Kentish Town, North London.

The actor accused Mr Flint of 'groping' his girlfriend Ms Scodelario then jumping on his bonnet, which prompted him to flee the scene while she was still in the fast food restaurant.

Kaya Scodelario has since said the distressing incident prompted her break-up with the Shameless star three years later, according to the trainee plumber's lawyer.

Barrister Andrew Roy made the claim as he questioned the actor's version of events, citing that 'to the best of Ms Scodelario's knowledge' the attack had 'caused her relationship with Mr Tittensor to end'.

Now 25, Mr Tittensor was fined £750 and handed six penalty points following the incident after he admitted driving without insurance.

Mr Flint was 18 at the time of the row in August 2010 and said he suffered head injuries, the loss of sight in his left eye and brain damage which caused a dramatic personality change.

Now 22, he is claiming damages for 'unlawful battery' against the actor, who with his twin brother Luke has starred in Shameless and Brookside.

Barrister Andrew Roy, for Mr Flint, told the High Court the incident began when the plumber asked to use Mr Tittensor's phone because his battery had run out.

When he asked for a second time the actor swore at him, Mr Roy said. 

Mr Flint then 'responded by swearing back and slamming his hand on the car bonnet', before Mr Tittensor 'drove forward' and 'hit Mr Flint with the front of his car'.

With Mr Flint on his bonnet, the barrister said Mr Tittensor 'continued to drive forward whilst shaking the wheel to throw Mr Flint off the bonnet, and succeeding in throwing him violently and heavily to the ground.'

But the Shameless star fiercely denied the plumber's version of events, saying he acted in self-defence.

He reported what he called a 'frenzied attack' to police an hour later and told them: 'A guy jumped on my bonnet and groped my girlfriend'.

Speaking from the witness box today, he said: 'Kaya's safety was a concern of mine, but my own was my main concern at the time, because of what I'd been through. Mr Flint was very aggressive.'

'It was a ridiculously lurid incident... I was too frightened... I was so scared after the whole of what happened I didn't know what to do.'  

William Norris QC, for Mr Tittensor, said the plumber was 'wholly the author of his own misfortune'.

The barrister said: 'He was drunk and... accosted Mr Tittensor's then girlfriend, Kaya Scodelario.

'He stood in front of his car and tried to prevent him driving off, banging on the bonnet, then climbing onto it and attacking the windscreen.

'In fear for his own safety, Mr Tittensor drove away just to escape, and succeeded is dislodging Mr Flint, who fell from the bonnet and sustained serious injury.

'In acting as he did, Mr Tittensor was behaving reasonably in reacting to an unexpected and frightening event.

'He did not intend to collide with him, and did not in fact do so. Rather, it was Mr Flint who got onto the bonnet deliberately and Mr Tittensor only tried to dislodge him.

'Mr Tittensor's case, simply, is that he acted reasonably in trying to drive away and in dislodging an aggressor who had threatened him, attacked his car, and got onto the bonnet to continue that attack.'

Of his client driving off, Mr Norris added: 'Such conduct should really be seen as more consistent with someone who fled the scene in a panic, frightened to the extent that he was no longer behaving in a rational and dispassionate way.

'Only that explains why he made his escape even before Kaya Scodelario had come out of the restaurant.'

Mr Norris accused the plumber of having 'some history of aggressive behaviour', including a conviction for being drunk and disorderly.

Mr Flint admitted that he had been disorderly on that previous occasion, but it was only to the extent of 'not doing what I was told by a police officer.'

But the plumber's barrister hit back, calling the actor's version of events 'highly improbable'. 

'To hit and run in this way is not reasonable behaviour,' he said. 'To the contrary it is unlawful'. 

He said Kaya Scodelario has been friendly to the plumber since - something that would be unlikely if her ex-boyfriend had been an innocent victim of a 'frenzied attack' that broke up their relationship.

The barrister said: 'This is surprising, to put it mildly, if, to the best of Ms Scodelario's knowledge, Mr Flint had carried out the frenzied attack attributed to him and had moreover caused her relationship with Mr Tittensor to end, itself improbable if Mr Tittensor was a blameless victim, as he contends.'

The High Court hearing continues.
