Hostels were once the crowded, dirty havens for backpackers on a budget. 

Rooming with 12 strangers who kept you awake with their snoring or worse, bathrooms you needed a vaccination before entering and bedsheets sure to leave you scratching for days were sacrifices made in return for a night's shelter for under a tenner.

With such a bad reputation, it is no surprise that a trend for posh hostels - or 'poshtels' - is emerging.

Not so posh: Crowded, dirty dorm rooms have been the haunt of backpackers on a budget

1. Casa Gracia – Barcelona, Spain 

2. Generator – Dublin, Ireland

3. Kex – Reykjavik, Iceland 

4. Gallery Hostel – Porto, Portugal 

5. ONE80° Hostel – Berlin, Germany 

6. Clink78 – London, UK

7. U Hostel – Madrid, Spain 

8. Dream Hostel – Tampere, Finland 

9. Palmers Lodge Swiss Cottage – London, UK

10. Maverick Hostel – Budapest, Hungary

Popping up in London, Berlin, Reykjavik and Barcelona, these boutique hostels combine comfort and high-tech facilities with affordability.

Sleek or unique design, rooms with en suites and free Wi-Fi are regular features of the Poshtel, appealing to travellers other than backpackers who are on a budget but can afford to spend a little extra for the comfort and connectivity. 

While some poshtels go for less than £30 per night, the average room is £50 per night - a bargain for central London.

The design-led Generator brand has extended to six more European cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Copenhagen, Dublin, Hamburg, and Venice) following the original's overwhelming success in London, with three more (Paris, Rome and Amsterdam) set to open next year.

The poshtel was identified at this month's World Travel Market 2014 as a key trend for 2015, with more expected to open as the demand for the hotel/hostel hybrid increases. 

With this in mind, hotel comparison website trivago.co.uk compiled a list of Europe’s top ten poshtels. Here is their pick of the best...
