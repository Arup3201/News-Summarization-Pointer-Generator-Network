Dozens of celebrities and politicians including Gavin Henson and Sadie Frost have settled damages claims over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, the High Court heard today.

Actress and designer Sadie Frost has received £50,000 in damages while Gavin Henson has been paid £40,000. Footballer Ashley Cole has also received damages but the figure was not disclosed.

Shaun Russell, whose wife and daughter 
were killed in Kent in 1996, and Sara Payne, the mother of murdered 
schoolgirl Sarah, are also among 36 claimants who have reached 
settlements. The payments are expected to take the total bill for Rupert Murdoch's News International up to £10m.

Revelations about the payments came as lawyers said that the company had admitted covering up the scale of illegal activity.

Lawyers for the victims said in a statement outside the High Court: 'News Group has agreed to compensation 
being assessed on the basis that senior employees and directors of NGN 
knew about the wrongdoing and sought to conceal it by deliberately 
deceiving investigators and destroying evidence.'

The group of lawyers made the claim before they told the court who had received settlements and for how much. 

They claim to have obtained documents from News International that revealed its attempts to destroy evidence, partly thanks to the fact that the 12 solicitors’ firms involved had joined forces to work together.

'As a result, documents relating to the nature and scale of the conspiracy, a cover up and the destruction of evidence/email archives by News Group have now been disclosed to the claimants,' their statement said.

'In the face of this overwhelming evidence, the ‘rogue reporter’ position has disintegrated and the range, scale and extent of phone-hacking has become clear.'

News International, the British newspaper arm of News Corp, said it would not comment on the statement.

Thirty-six claimants have so far been awarded settlements and 18 of these were revealed in court today.

They include Jude Law, who has accepted a settlement of
£130,000 plus legal costs from News International while his personal 
assistant Ben Jackson received £40,000. Ciara Parkes, his former PR advisor, has received £35,000.

After the hearing today, Mr Law condemned the 'appalling' behaviour of News of the World and said he brought legal proceedings 'to try to find out the truth'. His phone was hacked repeatedly, including at JFK Airport in New York.

He said: 'For several years leading up to 2006, I was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press. I changed my phones, I had my house swept for bugs but still the information kept being published. I started to become distrustful of people close to me.

'I was truly appalled by what I was shown by the police and by what my lawyers have discovered. It is clear that I, along with many others, was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years.

'No aspect of my private life was safe from intrusion by News Group Newspapers, including the lives of my children and the people who work for me. It was not just that my phone messages were listened to. News Group also paid people to watch me and my house for days at a time and to follow me and those close to me, both in this country and abroad.

MPs who have received settlements include Labour
MP Chris Bryant who was awarded £30,000, Lord Prescott who receives 
£40,000 in damages and Joan Hammell, his former chief of 
staff, also received £40,000. Labour MP Denis MacShane received £32,500 while MP Claire Ward received substantial damages but these were not disclosed to the court. 

Speaking to the Hull Daily Mail, Lord
Prescott said: 'Today's court decision at long last brings clarity, 
apology and compensation for the years of hacking into my telephone 
messages by Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers.

'It follows years of aggressive 
denials and a cavalier approach to private information and the law. 
These denials were supported by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) 
and the inaction of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police.

'However, I do not wish to make 
further comment on this whole matter until the result of my judicial 
review against the Metropolitan Police has been concluded.'

Anonymous claim 'HSK' who was hacked 
following a relationship with somebody famous was awarded £60,000. While
Lisa Gower, who had a phone hacked after being linked to Steve Coogan, 
was given £30,000.

Prince Harry's friend Guy Pelly received £40,000, the court heard. Other public figures whose settlements were revealed today include the writer Joan Smith, football lawyer Graham Shear, journalist Tom Rowland and Harold Shipman's son Christopher.

Former cavalry officer James Hewitt, who had an affair 
with Diana, Princess of Wales, is among those who have received a payout, as is former MP George Galloway, singer Dannii Minogue, Calum Best, the son of George 
Best, and Meg Matthews, the ex-wife of former Oasis guitarist Noel 
Gallagher.

News International has already paid 
out a £2m settlement to the family of Milly Dowler. Gordon Taylor of the
Football Association was given a reported £700,000 to settle a claim 
while Max Clifford received a £1m settlement.

It was alleged today that  senior employees
and directors at News Group Newspapers (NGN), the News International 
subsidiary that published the News of the World, knew journalists were 
hacking phones.

Lawyers acting on behalf of the victims claim that the group 
deliberately deceived police investigators and destroyed potentially 
incriminating evidence. NGN has not commented on the suggestion that 
senior employees knew what has happening, according to the Guardian.

Other claims that have been settled included those from Gavin Henson, the former partner of Charlotte Church.

The deals mean that 36 damages claims being brought against News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of the now-defunct News of the World, have been settled.

But Mark Thomson, of law firm Atkins Thomson, who represents some of the claimants, said others would press ahead with a trial scheduled for next month.

Mr Thomson said: 'All of the claimants have been extremely brave to take on and succeed against a massive and influential multinational media organisation.

'They can take the credit for triggering the new police investigation, the parliamentary inquiries and the Leveson Inquiry. They should be very pleased with what they have achieved.

'A number of claimants are still pursuing the matter to trial and, as a result, NGN will continue to disclose further information and evidence.'

Today’s hearing before Mr Justice Vos follows the settlement of a number of other claims against News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers, publisher of the now defunct News of the World.

When the case was last before the judge, in December, it emerged that seven cases had been resolved with a number of others likely to be so.

It was said in other High Court proceedings in December, involving private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and NGN, that, as of then, more than 60 claimants had commenced proceedings against NGN and Mulcaire for breach of confidence and misuse of private information, with the majority outstanding.

Mark Lewis, a lawyer for many of the phone hacking victims, said in an email that the fight against Murdoch's empire was not over.

'While congratulations are due to those (lawyers) and clients who have settled their cases, it is important that we don't get carried away into thinking that the war is over,' Lewis said.

'Fewer than 1 percent of the people who were hacked have settled their cases. There are many more cases in the pipeline. ... This is too early to celebrate, we're not even at the end of the beginning.'

Tamsin Allen, of law firm Bindmans, said: 'The claimants now have some clarity about what happened to them in the years between 2000 and 2005 and satisfaction that justice has finally been done.

'Many of them have wondered for years how tabloid newspapers were able to obtain secret personal information about them, even suspecting their closest friends and relatives.

'Lives have been severely affected by this cavalier approach to private information and the law. News Group's misguided decision to defend claims aggressively made matters worse.'

The phone-hacking saga began with the conviction in 2007 of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and the News of the World's royal editor Clive Goodman.

At the time NGN said the hacking, involving the voicemails of royal aides, was an isolated incident.But the settlement of legal action by Professional Footballers' Association boss Gordon Taylor and PR man Max Clifford led to speculation that phone hacking was more widespread.

As more details of the scandal emerged last summer, the scandal forced the resignation of 
Prime Minister David Cameron’s spokesman, a former News of the World 
editor. British police were accused of failing to properly investigate 
the affair and top police officials resigned.

In July, after it emerged that the 
voicemail of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, later found dead, had been
hacked by the News of the World, News Corp took the drastic step of 
shutting down the 168-year-old tabloid. Mr  Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry to examine the behaviour of the press.

News International set up a compensation scheme in November to deal with phone-hacking claims, moving to contain the consequences of a scandal that has rocked the company, the British press, police and the political establishment.It has already received more than 60 claims and police say there are almost 6,000 potential victims.

Criminal probes are now under way into the phone hacking and allegations of payoffs to police.  News Corp was forced to scrap plans to take full control of Britain’s highly profitable satellite broadcaster BSkyB.

Hearings in the first cases of victims who have not settled are set to begin on February 13.
