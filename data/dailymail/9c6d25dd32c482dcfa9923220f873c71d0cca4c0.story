It may not have had the drama and daring acts of the Opening Ceremony, but tonight's finale to the past two week's of Olympic action, still proved popular with celebrities on Twitter.

Costing around £13million, there was a lukewarm reaction to the show at the start, but when the tribute to British music began, high profile figures took to the social networking site to issue tweets of praise.

It was another sold-out crowd at the 80,000-capacity athletics stadium in east London and 300 million people were expected to tune in on televisions around the world.

being a Croque Madame. Not cheesy, hammy or eggy so far. Go Stomp!'

There was praise for Take That's frontman Gary Barlow - just a week after his daughter Poppy was stillborn, he bravely took to the stage to perform with the group.

After the foursome sang Rule the World, Girl's Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh ‏tweeted: 'Full of admiration for @GBarlowOfficial tonight.'

Comedian John Bishop ‏ wrote: 'To be fair that final bit was class. @GBarlowOfficial - sometimes you meet people are better than you and he is up there. What an end. Night.'

Mr Cameron in turn offered the UK's congratulations on the US team's 'astounding' medals table-topping performance and said Britain had 'thoroughly enjoyed' hosting its athletes.

A White House spokesman said: 'President Obama called Prime Minister Cameron today to congratulate him and the people of the United Kingdom and London on an extremely successful Olympic games, which speaks to the character and spirit of our close ally.

stage at the London 2012 Olympic Closing Ceremony wearing black and 
purple striped trousers and a matching top hat.

Reed, who is in the Royal Navy and a former Oxford Blue, had his 31st birth on the day the Olympics opened on July 27. His fiance is German and works in marketing.

The reunion of the Spice Girls who sang 
Wannabe and Spice Up Your Life also inspired several famous faces to 
voice their opinions.

Spectator editor Fraser Nelson wrote: ‘Thanks Rio for reminding us - we Brits 
may grumble at music selection. But Olympic ceremonies can be much, much
worse.’

The New York Times hailed the Closing Ceremony as a 'uniquely British show'.

'With a gaudy three-hour farewell that mashed up theater, acrobatics, fashion and a few generations of musical idols, London extinguished the Olympic torch on Sunday night, capping a fortnight of athletic achievements with a jukebox collection of songs and a marathon display of endearingly wacky stagecraft.' 

The Sydney Morning Herald wrote: 'London 2012 has ended with one giant party as the Brits celebrated a Games of which they have every right to be very proud.'

Some of those who starred in the finale took to Twitter to express their delight at being a part of the spectacle.
