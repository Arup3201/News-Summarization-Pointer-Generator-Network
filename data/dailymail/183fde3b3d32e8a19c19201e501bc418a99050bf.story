Toy's such as Disney's AppMates cars, costing up to £40 per set, could be bestsellers this Christmas

As studies show rocketing numbers play games on their parents' 
tablets, manufacturers have begun to target children with a range of 
'real' toys such as cars that can interact with a tablet.

Even Furby, one of the original electronic animal toys, is set to be re-released with an accompanying iPad app.

The secret to many of the app toys is simple - conductive paint.

Applied to small areas on the toys base, they allow the iPad to track each paint spot as if it were a finger, allowing developers to write games that can track the toys accurately.

The toys, such as a car or an action figure, are placed on the tablet's screen and interact with an app, or can control a toy themselves, such a remote controlled helicopter.

The move comes as iPads are increasingly used as children's toys.

Recent research in the UK and the United States found 39 per cent of adults who own an iPad have downloaded an app for children aged six to 11.

Parents are also increasingly downloading apps - another study said parents download an average of 6.8 apps for children aged three to eight every three months.Toys that connect to tablets are now tipped to be one of the top 10 Christmas toys this year, with giants like Disney and Mattel spearheading the move.

Even the Furby, one of the original electronic toys, is set to be re-released with an iPad app.

'They are going to be very popular this Christmas,' said Stuart Miles of web site Pocket Lint.

'Luckily there aren't too expensive,' and they do use the tablet which a parent already has.

'I think with things like the cars people will see them as stocking fillers'

Mr Miles also believes the toys will be just as popular with parents.

'Kids will feel its more a traditional toy, even though they're really just a bit of plastic, while the more advanced toys like remote control helicopters appeal to grown ups as well.

'Parents who are into technology want their kids to play as well - and they get to play with toys as well.

'I'm a dad, I want to be able to play on my iPad more, so my son can play with me, and we both have a great time.'

Samantha Loveday, editor of Toy News, told the Independent: 'Christmas is obviously the toy industry's most important part of the year.

'There are a lot of good toys coming out, but I think Apptivity toys have the potential to be up there.

It's very 'of the moment'.'

The £40 app controlled Helo TC could also be a hit. App toys are expected to be huge hits this Christmas.

Dr Amanda Gummer, a psychologist specialising in play and parenting, said: 'Today's children are growing up with technology and expect it in many of their playthings.

'Combining a physical toy with the excitement of an app and the contemporary appeal of an iPad is a completely new way for kids to play.'

However, it's also set to give existing games a new lease of life, with add on toys for Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, both hugely popular iPad games, set to get a 'real life' upgrade before Christmas.
