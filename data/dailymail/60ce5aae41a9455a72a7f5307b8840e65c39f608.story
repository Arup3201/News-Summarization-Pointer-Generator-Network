It's taken around 3,650 hours, a wealth of make-up and false wigs and a fair amount of computer wizardry, but Dominick Reed has become an internet hit after taking these wacky pictures of himself every day for two years.

The bizarre pictures show the 40-year-old posing with his tongue well and truly tied, 
blow drying the inside of his mouth and with his head in the shape of a cactus.

In one picture the software developer even picks up knitting needles to make him look like X-Men's Wolverine.

Unlocking the mystery: It took up to five hours each day to prepare for the pictures which demonstrate his imaginative skills

Woolverine: A rather less scary version of the classic X Men character

Tongue twister: Mr Reed used make-up, an array of costumes and his considerable photoshop skills to create the inventive pictures

Mr Reed, who now has a cult following around the world on internet site Flickr, said: 'In the past I used my camera to take family photos, but in 2004 I bought a digital camera and decided photography would be my new hobby.

'I started taking a photo every day with the hope that it would improve my photography skills, but I quickly ran out of ideas.

'I soon realised that the only thing always around was me so I began taking pictures of myself every day doing or wearing strange things.'

Mr Reed began the project in 2010 and often spent up to five hours getting ready for the photo.

In the two years of the project he has amassed a room full of fancy dress clothes, make-up, wigs and props.

He said: 'I collect bits and pieces from car boot sales and eBay. Sometimes it can take hours to do a photo and once it took a whole day when I buried myself in compost in the living room.'

All tied up: Despite him sometimes looking almost unrecognisable, Mr Reed is even being spotted on the streets by fans of his work

Blown up: Mr Reed's pictures have become so popular with his online fans he is publishing a book featuring hundreds of the pictures

The pictures include one with his 
head covered in tiny red balloons which he is about to burst, an image 
with bike pedals attached to his head and sticking a key in his ear.

Others show him dressed as an old 
woman with wrinkle cream, a picture of his head bound with string and as a boxer after a fight.

Mr Reed, who is publishing hundreds of the images in a new book, I Drink Lead Paint, is now even recognised in the streets.

That's a wrap: Mr Reed said his photography and photoshop skills have developed since he started the project in 2010

Pedal power: Mr Reed took a three month sabbatical from work to put together his book featuring the photographs

He said: 'It has been a really fun project and it has certainly improved my photography and photo shop skills.'

Last year he took a three-month 
sabbatical from work to put together his new book, after requests from 
online followers.

The book, which he funded through Kickstarter, a crowd-funding site, where he was given a four-week window to raise about Â£10,000, is expected to be published in the new year.
