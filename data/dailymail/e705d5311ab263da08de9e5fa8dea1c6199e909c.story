The devastated father of one of virgin killer Elliot Rodger’s victims has revealed that he discovered his daughter was dead using an iPhone tracking app.

Veronika Weiss was preparing for a charity event on Friday night when she was confronted by the gunman outside of her sorority house on the UCSB campus in Isla Vista.

Weiss, a first-year student, together with Katie Cooper from the Delta Delta Delta sorority were brutally gunned down at close range by Rodger.

Bob Weiss rushed to the campus, but was unable to get confirmation of Veronika's condition, he checked her phone and made the chilling discovery that the signal was coming from the middle of the crime scene

Once Veronika’s father, Bob Weiss, had heard about the shootings on the news he tried to call his daughter to check she was okay.

When he didn’t heard from her, he used an iPhone tracking app to see if they could locate her. To his horror, it placed his daughter right in the middle of the crime scene.

Weiss and his wife’s rushed to the scene, but unable to get confirmation of Veronika’s condition, he checked her phone again and made a chilling discovery.

‘We got to the border of the crime scene and we turned it on again,’ Weiss told KING5.

‘We could actually see the phone moving which we assume was Veronika Weiss's body being moved to the coroner's truck.’

Bob Weiss said he felt more sad than angry by what has happened. He also paid tribute to his daughter’s spirit.

‘She was fierce,’ he said. ‘She was strong. She was smart. She had a great sense of who she was and she took on everything.’

Weiss, 19, was a first-year student from Westlake Village, California. At Westlake High School she had been a water polo player who earned league honors during her senior year.

On Friday night Rodger had pounded on the front door of the Delta Delta Delta sorority house, when no one answered he was forced to improvise.

Walking around the corner, authorities say, he found a group of students - including Weiss - and opened fire.

'The shooter pounded on the door of the sorority. No one would let him in. He ran around the corner right into the face of these girls and just started firing on them. My guess is at very close range,' said Weiss.

Next Rodger jumped into his black BMW to continue his spree. Within 10 minutes, the rampage was over and Rodger was dead, apparently after shooting himself.

Bod Weiss told KING5 said he
 feels compassion for the shooter's family and for all those families 
dealing with yet another mass killing in America.

'The
 kids keep dying. The guns keep showing up everywhere. It seems like you
 can buy a gun as easily as you can get a Slurpee at 7/11. That's just 
too dangerous,' he said.
