A father returned from work to find his two young children had been smothered to death and his wife had apparently tried to slit her wrists.

Neighbours heard investment banker Jeff Boots, 34, cry ‘Oh my God, oh my God’ as he desperately tried to save his ten-week-old son and 14-month-old daughter Lily Skye.

He was later heard wailing: ‘My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They have gone. Help me, help me, help me.’

The children were pronounced dead at the scene when emergency services arrived at the £1.2million semi-detached house in an affluent part of Wandsworth, south London.

His wife, Felicia, also 34, was arrested at the family home. She had apparently tried to harm herself but did not need hospital treatment.

Mrs Boots, a jewellery designer who runs a website called Pink Tangerine, was being questioned by detectives from Child Abuse Investigation Command yesterday.

They are understood to be looking at the possibility that former hair stylist Mrs Boots is suffering from post-natal depression.

The couple, originally from Canada, had moved into the three-storey, five-bedroom house near Wandsworth Common only two weeks ago. The home is in a part of south London nicknamed ‘nappy valley’ because of its popularity with rich young professionals starting families.

One neighbour described them as appearing to be ‘a typical middle class couple’.

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said she heard Mr Boots’s reaction when he came home on Wednesday evening.

She said: ‘I could hear a man screaming: “Oh my God, oh my God”. He then shouted: “I loved my son and I loved my daughter”.

‘His voice was wailing: “My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They have gone”. Then he said: “Help me, help me, help me”.

‘I thought his wife should come and help him, but I heard nothing from his wife.

‘Then he shouted: “I love my family. I love my children”.

‘It was like a mantra which went on for a while. It was shocking when the police arrived and we realised how serious it was.’

Neither of the children had any visible injuries and it is believed they may have been smothered.

Oliver Jones, 27, a business consultant who lives opposite, said: ‘I arrived home when the first police car arrived and he was in floods of tears. The police were here from about 7.30 to about 9.30. The wife was led out to the police car. She seemed very calm and placid.’

Mr and Mrs Boots had previously spent five years renting a £2,100-a-month penthouse in an apartment block nearby.

Mrs Boots worked as a hair stylist in Canada but turned to creating her own jewellery from her home-based studio under the name Pink Tangerine after moving to London.

On her website it says: ‘A Canadian-born stylist is pursuing a dream.’

Her Facebook page has pictures of her on holiday with her husband. She comments on one picture of herself: ‘New doggy, yoga every day and 11-week-old Lily in my belly – a trip Boots and I won’t forget.’

Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
