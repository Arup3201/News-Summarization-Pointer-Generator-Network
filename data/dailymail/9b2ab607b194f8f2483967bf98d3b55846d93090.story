President Barack Obama has left India for Saudi Arabia without inking a climate deal that formed much of the basis for his second trip to the subcontinent.

The Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday that India has refused to embrace the idea of a 'peaking year' for greenhouse gas emissions – a designated year after which emissions levels would have to start decreasing.

China agreed to that sort of framework last year, but Indian officials now see being lumped in with Beijing as a negative thing. India is the world's fourth-biggest carbon emitter. China is number one.

'Having a peaking year was not acceptable to us,' an Indian environment ministry official told the Times.

Obama visited India on Air Force One, a plane that burns five gallons of jet fuel for every mile it flies. His round-trip, including a stop in Saudi Arabia, will emit 809 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere

'Few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India': Obama told 1,500 young people that he was trying to fix the planet for their generation, but left India empty-handed

The U.S. president spared no rhetorical expense on Tuesday morning in New Delhi, telling an audience of 1,500 youths that America would 'continue to help India deal with the impacts of climate change, because you shouldn't have to bear that burden alone.'

But that promise, it seems, applies chiefly if India follows Obama's lead, something it won't do.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is brushing off Obama's demands, instead maintaining that it will reduce CO2 levels as a percentage of its economic output – not in hard measurements of greenhouse gases.

India also says it will quintuple its solar energy capacity and boost its wind energy capacity 30-fold by 2022.

But a China-like agreement is off the table. In late 2014 Obama reached a deal with Beijing that committed the United States to a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 per cent, by the year 2025.

China promised its emissions would peak in 3030, but made no commitments with hard numbers attached.

Republicans in Congress complained bitterly, including Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, who now chairs the Committee on the Environment and Public Works.

'A promise to peak its carbon emissions only allows the world’s largest economy to buy time,' he said then.

So it's unlikely that even a firm deal with India would have brought Obama universal accolades.

Obama, though, strutted with his best climate talk during his speech at the Siri Fort Auditorium, an event that was marred by tech glitches in the video feed back to the United States.

'With rising seas, melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons, cyclones getting stronger, few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India,' he said.

But Obama also acknowledged a whiff of hypocrisy in asking India to foreswear fossil fuels just as its economy is breaking away from Third World status.

'I know the argument made by some, that it's unfair for countries like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century,' he said.

'But here's the truth: Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly like India, with soaring energy needs, don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change.'

Modi and his government, for now at least, lack his sense of urgency.

But the U.S. has held a carrot over his head, offering a $1 billion fund to help the country develop green energy if it complies. 

A'WARMING WE SHALL GO: Air Force One burns 5 gallons of jet fuel per mile, and each gallon puts 2.1 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere – bringing carbon footprint of Obama's plane to 809 TONS during the trip

The idea of climate change as a man-made source of global warming is as controversial and polarizing as ever.

NASA made global news this month when it got egg on its face after claiming 2014 was the hottest year on record.

Its own data, however, showed there was only about a one-third probability that was true.

In contrast, other scientists point to temperature measurements that indicate the planet hasn't warmed, on balance, for the last 17 years  even as emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases have dramatically increased.

Yesterday the hgh temperature in New Delhi was 64 degrees Fahrenheit, a bit below the historical January averageof 68.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, a moneyed U.S. environmental activist group, told the Associated Press that Obama didn't walk away completely empty-handed.

'This was a strengthening of the partnership on all levels, with climate at the heart,' said Anjali Jaiswal, who runs the group's India Initiative program.

'This is a whole new level of engagement that we're seeing from India.'

The NRDC did not respond to a request for comment after that engagement failed.
