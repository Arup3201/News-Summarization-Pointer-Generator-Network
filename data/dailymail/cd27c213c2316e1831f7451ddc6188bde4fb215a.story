He's in a relationship with one of the world's most beautiful women and now Ashton Kutcher has revealed his secret to dating success.

The Two And A Half Men star, who has a daughter with actress Mila Kunis, said the best tip he has learnt is just to be himself.

Ashton, 36, said: 'The biggest mistake people make on dates is that they try to be someone that they're not and they try to over perform, and then they start to set expectations for relationships which they can't keep up with over time.

Be yourself: The actor said the best advice he can give to people on a date is to not pretend to be someone they're not in order to make a good impression

'So I would say the best thing you can probably do be yourself and have enough self-humility to drive whatever car you have, and go to whatever restaurant you can afford to go to, and then just depend on you, because you're probably good enough.'

The Iowa-born star shared his thoughts in a behind the scenes interview while filming a new advert for Wrigley's Extra chewing gum.

The actor stars in the campaign which sees him 'breaking up' with an animated slice of pizza so he can have fresh breath and clean teeth for a date.

Speaking of his favourite foods for a dinner date, Ashton said he loves Italian dishes but he thinks the French produce the 'best over all cuisine.'

He added that British fish and chips are 'exceptional if done well' while the best Dim Sum he's ever tasted was when he was in London. 

Ashton has been engaged to Black Swan actress Mila, 31, since last February but he sparked rumours that they have already tied the knot when he posted a picture to his Facebook account on New Year's Eve which read 'Happy New Year, (love) The Kutchers.'

The couple welcomed their first daughter in October and Mila has said in the past that she would favour low key nuptials to a big white wedding.

She told W Magazine's August 2014 issue: 'Now my theory on weddings is: Don't invite anyone. Do it privately and secretly.'

Ashton was previously married to actress Demi Moore who is 15 years his senior. They separated in 2011 and their divorce was finalised in 2013.
