Andy Murray will take a detour to Spain later this month, as a last-ditch effort to reach the season-end climax in London after suffering yet another setback on Thursday.

The 27-year-old has confirmed his entry to the ATP Tour 500-level event in Valencia to try to edge himself into contention for November’s Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

After falling to a 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 defeat against David Ferrer in the Shanghai Open, Murray needs a strong showing in Valencia, and particularly at the Paris Masters the following week, to be part of the top eight competing for bountiful points and prize money at the O2 Arena.

The British No 1 smashes his racket en route to defeat to David Ferrer in Shanghai

1 Djokovic, Novak (SRB)

2 Federer, Roger (SUI)

3 Nadal, Rafael (ESP)

4 Wawrinka, Stan (SUI)

5 Nishikori, Kei (JPN)

6 Cilic, Marin (CRO)

7 Berdych, Tomas (CZE)

8 Raonic, Milos (CAN)

9 Ferrer, David 

10. Murray, Andy (GBR) 

The Scot has dropped to 10th place in the ‘Race For London’, with Ferrer moving into ninth, and the 2013 Wimbledon champion’s hopes will suffer a further blow if Ferrer beats Novak Djokovic in Friday's quarter-finals in China.

The Spaniard is ahead of him in the race, but Tomas Berdych in seventh and eighth-placed Milos Raonic are within Murray’s range if he can belatedly find some form as the tour moves indoors.

While Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have already qualified for London, many of Murray's rivals have struggled to make an impression in Shanghai.

Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori, Marin Cilic and Grigor Dimitrov - who sits behind Murray in 11th place - all suffered earlier defeats.
