West Brom boss Tony Pulis insists he has no problem with his Aston Villa counterpart Tim Sherwood following the latter's comments about the size of the two Midlands duo.

Prior to Tuesday's Barclays Premier League clash between the teams, Sherwood - a contender to take over as Baggies boss in the recent past - described Albion as a 'good little club' before expressing his delight at having landed the manager's job at a 'massive football club' like Villa.

Then, after his side won 2-1 in the game at Villa Park, Sherwood again made an apparent dig at West Brom, saying they will 'have to improve' for the next meeting - Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at the same venue - if they are going stop the hosts triumphing again.

West Brom manager Tony Pulis insists he does not have a problem with Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood

Sherwood said West Brom were a 'good little club' ahead of Aston Villa's 2-1 win against the Baggies 

But Pulis said ahead of this weekend's derby: 'That is Tim - there are no problems with me or the chairman at all.

'Tim is Tim and he will be good fun for everyone around the West Midlands for the time he is at Aston Villa I'm sure.'

Pulis stressed West Brom will not need to use either the words of Sherwood, for whom the win on Tuesday was his first since taking the Villa post last month, or the disappointment of their defeat in that game to generate any additional motivation for Saturday's contest.

With his players only one match away from a Wembley semi-final, Pulis - a beaten FA Cup finalist in 2011 as Stoke boss - said: 'I don't need to pin that (Sherwood's comments) up in the changing room.

'We have a good group of lads here and they will want to win the game as much as Villa will.

'I don't think we need any (extra) motivation. It's a local derby, it's the quarter-final of the FA Cup and it's absolutely wonderful that we've got to this stage. These are big games that everybody should look forward to and we will certainly be looking forward to it.

'We've got as good a chance (of winning the competition) as any of the eight teams left in there.

'You go and ask Bradford. They will fancy winning it as well.'

West Brom defeated non-league side Gateshead 7-0 in Pulis' first official game in charge of the Baggies 

Pulis' first game officially in charge of West Brom following his appointment in January was the 7-0 FA Cup third-round victory over non-league Gateshead at the Hawthorns.

Since then, Albion's run in the tournament has also seen them win 2-1 at Birmingham and 4-0 at home against West Ham.

Overall, the Baggies have lost only twice in their 11 games in all competitions under Pulis so far.

And asked if he had underestimated Villa on Tuesday night, the 57-year-old said: 'I have great respect for every club and every team.

'From the third round right the way through, and in every game we play in the Premier League or anything else - I have total respect for clubs, the people there and the supporters.

'I never underestimate anyone. I've been in the game too long to do that.'

West Brom will be without injured forward Victor Anichebe (groin) and cup-tied midfielder Darren Fletcher for Saturday's tie.

Pulis says he has a few 'knocks and niggles' in his squad to assess - winger Callum McManaman (foot) is a doubt, while forwards Saido Berahino and Brown Ideye have both been playing recently with pain-killing injections.

Pulis also said the club 'have to go carefully' with Stephane Sessegnon, with the forward understood to have suffered a family bereavement, and it remains to be seen whether goalkeeper Ben Foster keeps his place after his costly late error in Tuesday's loss.
