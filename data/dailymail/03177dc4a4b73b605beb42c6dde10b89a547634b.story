The decision to award the Golden Ball for the 2014 World Cup's best player to Argentina forward Lionel Messi has been greeted with surprise in many quarters.

Messi performed well in the group stages, scoring four goals in three games against Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria but his star has faded since, with the Barcelona star failing to find the net in knockout matches against Switzerland, Belgium, Holland and Germany.

In the final against Germany, Messi flashed one gilt-edged opportunity wide but otherwise struggled to influence proceedings.

VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi  

James Rodriguez (Colombia) - Despite playing just five games at the tournament, the Monaco forward scored six times and picked up the Golden Boot award.

Thomas Muller (Germany) - Again a standout at a major tournament, he found the net on five occasions and was a constant threat for the eventual winners.

Javier Mascherano (Argentina)
 - Different class in the middle of midfield as he took each game, 
particularly in the knockout stages, by the scruff of the neck and 
roared the South Americans on. Completed the most tackles of anyone at 
the World Cup.

Manuel Neuer (Germany)
 - Hugo Lloris, beware. This man is the very definition of a 
sweeper-keeper. Barely put a foot wrong all tournament with a string of 
top saves and bossed his area like no other.

Arjen Robben (Holland)
 - Although there were simulation antics, Robben's poise in 
possession and potency in front of goal were deciding factors in Louis 
van Gaal's team finishing third.

Nonetheless, after the final whistle, he was presented with the adidas Golden Ball, ahead of other leading contenders such as Colombia's James Rodriguez, Holland's Arjen Robben and German trio Manuel Neuer, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller.

It has led the conspiracy theorists to suggest that Messi, an ambassador for adidas, may have been granted preferential treatment, although it should be noted that the German firm also have links with Monaco star Rodriguez and they manufacture Germany kits.

Further speculation was triggered when it emerged that for the first time the Golden Ball was decided by FIFA's Technical Committee, rather than by a media vote. 

The 
general consensus, however, remains that Messi was a little fortunate to
 receive the award and that his name and reputation may have earned him 
the prize.

Former
 England captain Rio Ferdinand said on the BBC: 'I would have gone with 
James Rodriguez. He has played that exciting, attacking football and he 
has been trying to hurt the opposition. Messi has had some magic moments
 but you want them consistently.'

Speaking
 on his final appearance as a BBC pundit, Alan Hansen echoed Ferdinand's
 sentiments, stating: 'I didn't think Messi has done enough. Four or 
five of the Germans have played better over the tournament.'
