Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos has written a guide book for young women on surviving their 20s

Being a twentysomething in today's high-pressure world isn't easy. Life in this decade is flooded with expectations about what woman should weigh, say, eat, earn... 

In her new book psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, who is famous for her frank and practical advice, offers strategies that she says will empower young women to lead the life that they want while being happier and more confident. 

Here Dr Linda, 43, shares her top ten tips for surviving your twenties exclusively with FEMAIL.

1. TREAT SOCIAL NETWORKING POSTS LIKE A SCENE FROM  A REALITY SHOW

They are edited version of peoples’ lives and the editors are all trying to figure out what their audience wants and give it to them. We tend to go online to compare and what we are often comparing to is an exaggerated version of reality, so don't feel deflated when someone else’s life seems more exciting than yours.

Remember, no one ever posts updates on the nights where they are sitting at home eating last night's leftovers. It's all about impressing each other and you can choose to opt out of that and realise that how we engage online can impact who we think we need to be offline as well.

2. STOP WITH THE FOMO* (*Fear Of Missing Out)

The simple fact is that the more choice you have, the harder it is to choose. Ultimately, the only way around this is to make your choice and then actually engage with that choice rather than half-heartedly experiencing it and instead worrying about what else you could have been doing. 

Whatever the experience, it’s best if you are actually present when it’s happening. Sitting there worrying about what you’re missing out on means you’re actually missing out on everything.

3. REALISE YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR PROFILE PICTURE

The idea that women are valued for their looks is nothing new, but the sheer number and ubiquity of glamourised perfected images we see around us makes it feel like it’s expected that a woman should be as close to physically perfect as possible. 

By all means enjoy your looks; experimenting with the way you look is a normal and important part of establishing your identity. But don't become defined by them and certainly don't buy into the notion that any of us can reach the levels of physical perfection that we are made to believe we need to aspire to today.

4. BE ADAPTABLE

It’s really important to be able to react to what is actually happening in your life rather than trying to force fit life into some pre-determined way of what it ought to look like.

The truth is that sometimes things will happen that you don't expect, and no matter how organised you are or how much planning you have put into things you will be blind-sided by stuff that life throws at you. Because of this, adaptability, more than anything, is the trait that will get you not only through your 20s but through life.

Understanding that social networking posts are often exaggerated is key to staying positive, says Dr Linda

5. SPEND TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO AREN'T LIKE YOU

We live in a world where age stratification is increasingly common and means that we mostly spend time with people in the same age bracket as ourselves. And while it may feel that it’s only people your age that will really understand you, believe me the insights that you will get from hanging out with people that are older than you and that see things from a different perspective is such an important part of not only making sense of your past but also your future. 

People who have been here longer will challenge you to see things from a different angle so make time for your favourite aunt or grandma as she may have a perspective on things that might surprise you.

6. UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT TO BE HAPPY 

Like unicorns and effective cellulite creams, perfection is a mythical concept, it does not exist. You will make mistakes and you will feel like dropping out of things that you aren’t that good at, but the thing is, you can’t drop out of life so making peace with the idea that you can actually enjoy and learn from something, without having to be the best at it, is important.

7. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

Burn out is not a badge of honour. So while engaging in competitive sleep deprivation with your colleagues to prove that you can work harder than anyone else might be appealing, it will, eventually, catch up with you, and your health is something you should never take for granted at any age. 

Remember the basics: eat well, ditch the processed stuff and fad diets; sleep well (research shows that most of us really do need 7-8 hours to function optimally so make time for sleep); and get fit, exercise is a great stress buster as well as being good for your physical health so make it part of your self-care routine.

8. REMEMBER THAT BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP IS NOT THE BE ALL AND END ALL

Dr Linda's latest book is published on October 2

Feeling like there is something wrong with you until you’re in one is frankly illogical. It is not a testament to your value as a human being! It might be that you are simply single at this stage of your life, so enjoy it, fill it up with experiences and learning and discovery and connections and ultimately you will meet someone that you like because of who they are not because you’re looking for a relationship.

9. SEEK OUT AMAZING ROLE MODELS

There are some amazing women out there doing amazing things, but you need to look for them. Women are often celebrated for their physical desirability rather than their accomplishments so we don't really hear about the business women, the scientists, the political activists changing the world.

Be active in seeking out what inspires you, it will make a huge difference in how you see yourself and the world around you.

10. WRITE YOUR OWN SCRIPT 

Adulthood means finding your identity, writing your script. As kids and teens, even in college, knowing who you are seems pretty straightforward. In your 20s things aren’t so simple. Don't be afraid of that; in fact, enjoy the freedom to write your script rather than having it thrust upon you. It’s up to you what you buy into, and what you reject. And while you might have to re-write a few scenes or even re-think a few plot-lines it’s YOUR life so confront it, direct it and embrace it. 

Success doesn’t happen in a day, and the work and struggle you need to put in to get there are not obstacles just the natural process of getting to a place that is worth being in.
