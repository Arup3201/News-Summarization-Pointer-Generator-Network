Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life’.

And now, a never-before-seen photograph of the royal and his one-year-old grandson proves just how proud he is of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son.

The framed image of the 66-year-old and Prince George took pride of place on a table  in the background of a newly released video clip, which the Prince released to support the world's biggest environmental event, Earth Hour.

The Prince of Wales filmed a video about the important of taking part in the world's biggest environmental event, Earth Hour, this weekend and proved he's a proud grandfather with a sweet snap of him holding Prince George placed on a table in the background 

The photograph shows doting Prince Charles holding the young Prince, who looks as sweet as ever in a white sun hat and dungarees as he points into the distance 

The family snap, which was seemingly taken in the warmer summer months, shows doting Charles holding the young Prince, who looks as sweet as ever wearing a white sun-hat and navy blue dungarees as he seemingly points to something in the distance.

In the video, Charles speaks about why we should join in with the annual Earth Hour and turn off our lights this weekend. 

The photo, of Kate and William, who are expecting their second child next month, first son, is rather fitting; in the message, he urges people to work to save the planet 'not just for ourselves but also for our children and grandchildren'.

The new photo, which takes pole position in the video, comes after reports that the monarch is  frustrated that he doesn't see his grandson very often.

Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life.

At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne’s frustrations is the so-called ‘Middletonisation’ of his son William’s life — specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom the Duke recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole’s 60th.

In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called ‘March of the Middletons’ that he has complained to friends: ‘They never let me see my grandson.’

A source told the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare: ‘Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.’

It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it’s a deliberate move on William’s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. 

The video comes in the same month as reports that Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince's life

Most of William and Kate’s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot’s Licence.

The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional.

Little George, who will soon become a big brother after his mother gives birth next month, hasn't been seen in public since February.

Whilst the grandfather and grandson were pictured together at the young royal's christening, the new photo is the only one of Prince Charles and Prince George that we have seen alone

The tiny tot was seen being carried through St. Lucia's tiny airport and boarding a British Airways plane as they prepared to travel back to London, following their annual holiday on the island of Mustique.

Kate, who was almost seven months pregnant at the time, and William were on the island to celebrate Carole Middleton's 60th birthday on the 31st January, as well as for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in April. 

Prince William today told wellwishers ‘not long now’, as his pregnant wife Kate stepped out for her last official outing before she gives birth.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visiting the Stephen Lawrence Centre at the start of a day of engagements in South London.

Kate, who is due to give birth late next month, looked radiant in a £1,500 fuschia-pink Mulberry coat as they toured the building named after the murdered teenager with his mother, now Baroness Doreen Lawrence of Clarendon, 62, and his younger brother Stuart, 37.

It's her final day of official engagements before the birth of Royal baby number two. And the Duchess of Cambridge is definitely going out in style!

She joined her husband in London, where they are visiting three projects, and of course she looked as elegant as ever. And if you wanted a hint as to whether she's expecting a prince or princess, you've got a clear clue!

She recycled a bright pink coat by British brand Mulberry (whose newest model is none other than Cressida Bonas!). It's the same coat we spotted Kate wearing whilst in New York last December and we love the double breasted style.

This gorgeous shade of fuchsia is perfect to add a pop of colour to your new season wardrobe and if you thought the pink coat trend was so last year then think again. Thanks to labels like Burberry Prorsum and Gucci it's back stronger than ever.
