An Oregon teen was celebrating her birthday Saturday with a mall shopping trip when an employee at a clothing store told her to leave because she was 'too big'.

Shelby Buster told KEZI that she was shopping with a friend at the rue21 clothing store at the Valley River Center mall in Eugene, Oregon when she was discriminated against for her weight.

Shelby says she was hoping to buy some perfume with birthday money, when a store employee came up to her and said: 'Hey, you're too big to be in this store, I need you to leave.'

Her friend continued to check out before the two returned to the food court and told Shelby's mom, Marge Wood-Buster, what happened.

Mrs Wood-Buster walked back to the store to complain, at which point one of the employees apologized.

After the event, Shelby posted on the company's Facebook page, complaining about the incident.

The company commented on her post and said they were 'really sorry to hear this' and that the employee's comment was 'completely unacceptable'.

They asked Shelby to private message them so they could discuss the incident further.

After her story was broadcast on KEZI, more people got on the company's Facebook page to complain about the incident, many saying that they would never shop at the store again.

Nicole Jefferson wrote that she won't be shopping at the Eugene store after what happened to Shelby.

'No one should feel discriminated against on how they look. I'll be telling all my friends not to shop here too,' Ms Jefferson wrote.

The company replied to several of these complaints with a prepared statement that said they were investigating the claims and haven't yet been able to substantiate them.

'We have been unable to corroborate that the incident actually happened,' the statement read. 'We value diversity and welcome all customers in our stores. We train our associates on inclusion and do not condone discrimination in any form. Behaviors like that described are unacceptable and are not by any means directive of the company.'

When asked how they were handling the discrimination, the company's district manager told KEZI that they would be pulling video footage from Saturday afternoon to investigate what happened.
