In the dock: George Huguely V is escorted by a sheriff's deputy as he arrives for his trial

A former University of Virginia lacrosse player accused of murdering his girlfriend wrote a letter to her shortly before she died saying that he could not control his behaviour and apologising for choking her, a prosecution lawyer said yesterday.

During closing arguments in the murder trial of George Huguely V, a prosecutor said investigators found the letter from Huguely to Yeardley Love when they arrived at the scene where she was found dead in May 2010 from blunt force trauma to the head.

'I cannot control the way I behave,' Huguely, 24, was quoted by prosecutor Dave Chapman as saying in the letter written in February 2010. 'Alcohol is ruining my life.'

Mr Chapman said that Huguely did not keep his vow in the letter to never hurt Miss Love again. The letter had been mentioned earlier in the trial but exact quotes were read to the jury for the first time during the final arguments.

The prosecutor said a drunk Huguely walked into the 22-year-old's apartment while she was asleep, kicked in her bedroom door and slammed her head against the wall.

'He left her face down on her bed with her arms at her side, palms face up,' said Mr Chapman, who wept as he delivered his closing statement.

Prosecution expert witnesses have said Miss Love, from Cockeysville, Maryland, died about two hours later from blunt force trauma to the head.

The trial has attracted national media attention to the quiet college town of Charlottesville, Virginia. Jurors are scheduled to begin deliberating on Wednesday, the next available court date.

Lovers: Yeardley Love and George Huguely, both students at the University of Virginia, had an on-off relationship

Wrapping up: Yesterday saw the closing statements in Huguely's trial

Huguely, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, 
has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder, 
robbery, burglary at night, breaking and entering, grand larceny and 
murder during a robbery.

In closing arguments, Defence 
Attorney Francis Lawrence said the prosecution team has been 
'over-zealous' in charging Huguely with first-degree murder.

'Where's the intent to kill?' Mr Lawrence asked jurors.

The defence lawyer acknowledged that 
Huguely 'played a role' in Miss Love's death and was intoxicated, loud 
and clumsy the night of her death but had no intention of killing her.

Mr Lawrence said Huguely's reaction 
to police, who arrested and interrogated him the morning following Miss 
Love's death, showed that Huguely was 'a young man who has no clue' that
she had died.

He described the student as a 'stupid drunk' who lived in a 'lacrosse ghetto' which led to a lack of perspective.

Huguely told police that Miss Love 
bloodied herself by banging her own head against the wall. Both were 
lacrosse players for Virginia's nationally-ranked lacrosse teams.

Accused: Mr Huguely has been charged with first-degree murder following Ms Love's death

On Friday, the jury heard that Huguely and Miss Love were holding hands in a bar just 24 hours before she died.

Huguely's aunt and godmother, Alina 
Massaro, testified that the pair were holding hands the night of 
Saturday, May 1, roughly 24 hours before Huguely confronted Miss Love.

The court were played a video recording of the hand-holding which was taken from a bar surveillance tape.

Mrs Massaro explained to the jury: 'There's Georgie, and now that's Yeardley, and they're holding hands.' The recording was not visible to the court gallery.

She
said the family went out to a bar after her nephew's lacrosse game 
where they ran into Miss Love. On the tape, she can be seen hugging his 
relatives and his aunt said things between the two students were cordial
and friendly.

Lacrosse: The pair were both enthusiastic sports players and were friends with the rest of the lacrosse team

The day before, the 24-year-old was 
accused of lying about visiting his friends on the night she died. 
Former teammate Ken Clausen testified on Wednesday, the day the 
prosecution rested and defence began.

The defense began its presentation 
with a medical expert who said he believed Ms Love was asphyxiated from 
lying face down in a damp, bloody pillow. The testimony did not state 
how she came to be in that position.

While
Huguely acknowledged in a police interrogation that his final 
encounter with Ms Love turned physical, he said he did not believe her 
injuries were serious.

His 
attorneys have argued that her death was accidental, possibly the result
of drinking and a prescription drug she took for attention-deficit 
disorder. A coroner has said those substances were in her body but not 
in potentially lethal doses.

Most of the prosecution witnesses on Wednesday were former lacrosse players, many of whom knew Ms Love.

The
day before her body was found, Huguely was seen drunk during an 
end-of-season father-son golf tournament and dinner, his teammates said,
describing his slurred speech and public urination.

Later that night, he and other friends went to Huguely's apartment for beers and to watch TV.

About
20 minutes before midnight, they decided to go to a nearby store to 
pick up some more beer while Huguely remained in the apartment, the 
teammates said. They came back with the beer 15 or 20 minutes later, and
Huguely was not in the apartment but soon returned.

He
told his friends he had gone to visit two other teammates in his 
apartment building. One of the teammates, however, had stayed in his own
apartment and was not in Huguely's building.

On trial: Mr Huguely acted strangely on the night of the killing, the court has heard

Asked by Mr Chapman about Huguely's demeanour, the witness said: 'He had this blank stare on his face.'

Mr Clausen said he repeatedly asked Huguely what was bothering him, but 'got no response'.

He said of Huguely's mood after he returned from the beer run, 'There was no doubt in my mind there was a change in his demeanour.'

Mr Carroll testified, however, that he detected no difference in Huguely's mood. 'I just thought he was really, really drunk,' he said.

Huguely told the two witnesses he went to visit fellow players Chris Clements and Will Bolton downstairs in Mr Clements' apartment. Mr Bolton testified, however, that he was not with Mr Clements and was at his own apartment.

Prosecutors have placed Huguely's visit to Ms Love's nearby apartment at approximately midnight. Her body was found about two hours later.

In a police interrogation interview hours after Ms Love's death, Huguely told a detective that he 'shook her a little' but did not hit her in the face. He said she hit her own head against the wall and that he did not think she was seriously hurt when he left.

Huguely said he had gone to his ex-girlfriend's apartment 'just to talk'. When she refused to let him in, he kicked through the door.

The trial continues.
