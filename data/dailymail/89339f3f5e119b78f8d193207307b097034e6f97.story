Ban: The legal challenge by tobacco companies against plain packaging was rejected by the Australian High Court

Australia is banning the sale of branded packaging of tobacco products after the High Court dismissed
 a challenge from international cigarette companies on the new 
anti-tobacco marketing laws.

The court ruled the laws did not 
breach Australia's constitution dispelling the claim by tobacco 
companies that they were unconstitutional because they 
effectively extinguished their intellectual property rights.

The case has been closely watched 
around the world, including in Britain where the Department of Health’s 
public consultation on plain packaging finished last Friday.

From December this year cigarettes and
 tobacco products sold in Australia will have to be in plain unbranded olive green packets 
carrying graphic health warnings.

When the new legislation was passed last year it
 was challenged by tobacco companies British American Tobacco, Britain's
 Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco who lost in court 
today.

Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon hailed the ruling as ‘a watershed moment for tobacco control around the world.

‘The message to the rest of the world 
is big tobacco can be taken on and beaten,’ said Roxon, whose father, a 
smoker, died of cancer when she was 10.

‘Without brave governments willing to 
take the fight up to big tobacco, they'd still have us believing that 
tobacco is neither harmful nor addictive.’

The Australian High Court’s decision 
is a major blow to tobacco companies as Britain and other countries 
including New Zealand and Norway are moving towards similar legislation.

British American Tobacco Australia said the measures would fuel a black market for cigarettes.

‘It's still a bad law that will only 
benefit organised crime groups which sell illegal tobacco on our 
streets,’ BAT Australia spokesman Scott McIntyre said after the 
decision.

‘Even though we believe the government
 has taken our property from us, we'll ensure our products comply with 
the plain packaging requirements and implementation dates.’

The court's decision was welcomed by 
anti-smoking groups including non-government cancer control 
organisation Cancer Council Australia.

Ian Olver, chief executive said: ‘We 
hope other nations follow Australia's lead and eliminate the use of 
tobacco packaging as a marketing tool, to help reduce the global tobacco
 death toll - which is on track to reach half a billion people this 
century,’

The ruling was applauded by 
neighbouring New Zealand’s Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia who 
said it provided ‘a greater sense of security’ as the New Zealand 
government move towards similar legislation.

In Britain a consultation was made by the Department of Health on plain packaging which closed last Friday.

The department of Health has yet to 
report any results of the survey and told MailOnline that due to the 
large number of responses it is impossible to set an exact date for 
publishing.

‘Previous consultations has been 
approximately 85,000 and we are expecting as many if not more answers on
 this matter,’ Chelsea Austin with the Department of Health said.

‘It will take time for all to be analysed and the recommendation to be sent to the Secretary of State’.

British Public Health Minister Anne Milton said today that they will look carefully at today’s judgement on Australia’s plain packaging laws as they analyse the results of the public consultation

‘We are considering whether plain packaging of tobacco could bring public health benefits in this country in addition to what we are already doing,’ she said in a statement.

‘We have an open mind about the introduction of plain packaging. 

‘Any decisions to take further policy action will be taken only after full consideration is given to consultation responses, evidence and other information.  

A ban on tobacco promotion was imposed
 in April which means that supermarkets across England now have to keep tobacco 
products behind shutters or under the counter.

Despite the court ruling then new law in Australia still faces a number of challenges under global trade rules.

Australia is already fighting trade 
complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) from Ukraine, Honduras 
and the Dominican Republic, who claim the laws unfairly restrict trade, 
although their trade with Australia is negligible.

Tobacco company Philip Morris also 
said it would launch a legal challenge against the laws under a 
bilateral Australia-Hong Kong investment agreement.

‘We believe that Philip Morris Asia's 
investment treaty case and the WTO challenges are strong. As such, there
 is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain 
packaging are fully explored and answered,’ PML spokesman Chris Argent 
said in a statement.

The World Health Organisation 
estimates more than one billion people around the world are regular 
smokers, with 80 per cent in low and middle income countries.

Australia wants to cut the number of 
smokers from around 15 per cent of the population to ten per cent by 
2018. Authorities say smoking kills around 15,000 Australians a year.
