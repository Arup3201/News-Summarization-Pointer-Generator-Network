For these glamorous performers, getting made up for work every morning can be a real drag.

But the only way to truly understand what they go through during the transformation is to come face to face with one, as these incredible pictures show.

Dozens of drag queens from across New York posed for this remarkable series of portraits called Half-Drag... A Different Kind of Beauty.

Face to face: Flame-haired Maddelynne Hatter has perfected the intense stare to a tee. He is one of fifteen drag queens from across New York who posed for this remarkable series of portraits called Half-drag... A Different Kind of Beauty

Bearded heyday: While some of the drag queens shaved their beards and chests for the shoot, Azraea decided to go au naturel

Frozen in time: Pattaya uses golden finger nails to enhance his oriental look

They were taken by US photographer Leland Bobbé in a bid to 'explore the cross over between males and females and to break down the physical barriers that separate them'.

And incredibly, he has used no camera trickery or digital enhancement to achieve his goal - each subject did his own makeup on the spot on just half of his face.

They are some of New York's most successful and sought after drag entertainers, with names as colourful as their get up.

Blue steel: Miss Fame has not only made up half his face with expertly-applied makeup but his body as well

They include flame-haired Maddelynne Hatter, the haughty Magnolia Applebottom, glamorous Crystal Demure, heavily-bearded Azraea and the sultry Kittin Withawhip.

Said Bobbé: 'With these images my intention is to capture both the male and the alter ego female side of these subjects in one image in order to explore the cross over between males and females and to break down the physical barriers that separate them.

Glitz and sparkle: Many of the subjects wear elabourate jewellery and props to amplify their feminine side, like Magnolia Applebottom, left, and Roxy Brooks

Challenging: Vivienne Pinay is one example of how the photographer tried to question 'the normative ideas about gender and gender fluidity'

Sabel Scities, left, and Epiphany Get Paid, right: In the artist's words, 'These are composed in camera and are not two separate images digitally composed'

Transformation: Kittin Withawhip is an example of how the queens use 'the power of hair and makeup to completely transform themselves and find their female side while showing their male side simultaneously'

Well known: All the Drag Queens, including Jessica Payge, pictured, are well known on New York's vibrant transvestite scene

'This in turn questions the normative ideas about gender and gender fluidity.

'Through the power of hair and makeup these men are able to completely transform themselves and find their female side while showing their male side simultaneously.

'These are composed in camera and are not two separate images digitally composed.'
