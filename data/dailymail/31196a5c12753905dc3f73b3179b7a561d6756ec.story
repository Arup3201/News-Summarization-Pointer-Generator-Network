Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said more than half of schools promised rebuilds could still be awaiting work at the end of 2017

David Cameron’s flagship school building programme is way off track, Labour claimed last night.

Despite promising in 2012 that a total of 261 promised rebuilds would ‘begin immediately’, work has started at just 63 of them.

Only 14 school buildings have been handed over for use under Mr Cameron’s priority school building programme. 

It means that over three quarters of schools promised rebuilds from this Government are still waiting for work to start three years and five months after the programme was first launched. 

But last night the Conservatives hit back - denying the scheme was behind schedule, and pointing out that it was managing to build schools a third cheaper than under Labour.

A Tory source said: ‘Labour must have been at the Christmas sherry.

‘It’s remarkable to be attacked by them for the state of school building. The fact is we’re building schools quicker and cheaper than under their wasteful programme, saving taxpayers around £5million per school.

‘If they really want to have a fight on this ground then that’s fine by us.’

However, shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said that if progress on school building continues at the current rate, more than half of those schools promised rebuilds could still be awaiting work to start by the deadline of the end of 2017.

He said: ‘This just goes to show that David Cameron’s Priority School Building Programme is decidedly not a priority for this Government, limping along at a staggeringly slow pace,’ he said.

‘On top of this, the Tory-led government’s decision to divert scarce resources away from areas desperately in need of more school places in order to fund their flawed Free School programme, has meant that more and more pupils up and down the country are being crammed into makeshift temporary classrooms.

‘David Cameron desperately needs to get a grip on the crisis he is creating in schools and ensure school buildings and classrooms are fit for our children to learn in.’

In July 2011, the government launched its replacement for Labour’s ‘Building Schools for the Future’ scheme after they scrapped it – the Priority Schools Building Programme.

In May of the following year, the then Education Secretary Michael Gove announced that work would begin ‘immediately’ on 261 schools that would have their condition needs met through the programme.

It is three years and five months since David Cameron's flagship school building programme was launched, and over two and a half years since Michael Gove announced that work would begin ‘immediately’

It is now three years and five months since the programme was launched, and over two and a half years since Mr Gove announced that work would begin ‘immediately’.

But earlier this month, schools minister David Laws told the Commons: ‘Under the Priority School Building Programme we have now signed construction contracts for 63 schools.

‘Eight schools have opened in new buildings since October 2014. This brings the total number of schools open in new buildings to 14.

‘Construction work is continuing at a number of these schools to demolish the old dilapidated buildings.’

Labour said that if progress was to continue at this rate - 63 schools since the programme’s launch 41 months ago; then more than half of those schools promised rebuilds would still be awaiting work to start by the deadline of the end of 2017. That is 36 months from now.

Last night the Coalition pointed out that school buildings are now being constructed for about a third less, saving the taxpayer millions of pounds.

Last night a spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘It is nonsense to suggest the Priority School Building Programme is behind schedule.

‘We are working with all 260 schools in the programme – 14 are open, 59 are being built, 64 contracts have been signed, and the others are in various stages of development.

‘Under the previous school building initiative, BSF, it took three years for building work to begin. Under the PSBP this time was slashed to one year. And the average secondary school now costs around £5million less to build, saving vital taxpayers’ money.’
