Injuries: George Milis, 43, was left with burns on his right eyeball, chin, cheek, forehead and nose after an Asda ready meal 'exploded in his face'

A man has been blinded in one eye and left with painful burns all over his face after a microwave ready meal exploded in his face.

Security supervisor George Milis popped the Asda Classic liver and bacon with colcannon mash into the microwave oven for his lunch at work.

Mr Milis, 43, claims he followed the instructions ‘to the letter’ and heated the food for ten minutes.

But when he took it out and peeled back the film the meal exploded, spraying scalding liquid all over his face as well as the walls and ceiling of the canteen.

Colleagues quickly washed the sizzling liquid from his face but the piping hot food had already burned his right eyeball - as well as his cheek, nose, chin and forehead.

Mr Milis is still without proper vision in his right eye - two weeks after the freak explosion - and fears he might never fully regain it.

The married father-of-one said: 'I peeled the film back and stirred the meal and the next thing I knew there was a bang and the meal had exploded.

'The plastic was intact, but burning hot liquid and bits of food were everywhere.

'It was on the ceiling, walls and all over me - absolutely everywhere. It was all over my face and in my eyes and ears.'

Mr Milis was rushed to the nearby South Bristol Community Hospital where A&E nurses said his burns would have been much worse had he not been close to a sink.

He added: 'The burns on my face are so painful, but I’m most worried about my sight in my right eye.

Followed the instructions: Mr Milis says he followed the instructions on the packaging and heated the liver and bacon with colcannon mash for 10 minutes in the microwave

'I’ve been told the liquid burnt my eyeball and my vision’s still blurry - I’m not sure how much it’ll recover.'

His wife Melanie bought the £1.50 meal from a local Asda in Bedminster, Bristol, and Mr Milis says he is grateful they didn’t cook it at home.

He said: 'We have a five-year-old and I just dread to think what would have happened if my wife had cooked that meal at home.

'In a way I’m glad it was me, but it shouldn’t have been anyone.'

Investigation: Asda says it is at a loss as to what could have caused the microwave meal to 'explode' and is carrying out an investigation into the incident

Mr Milis is urging Asda to remove the meal from sale but the company says it wants to hold an investigation and is 'at a loss' to what caused the incident.

An Asda spokeswoman said: 'We take any complaints about our products really seriously - especially when it comes to their safety.

'We’re at a loss to understand what could have happened with Mr Milis’ ready meal and would really like to investigate it further.

'Unfortunately, we haven’t received the packaging back from him yet, but we’re speaking to him regularly in the hope we can resolve this as quickly as possible.'
