Lucky her! The Queen has received hundreds of gifts in her Diamond Jubilee year - from jewellery to a Corgi dog bed in the shape of a crown

She is, surely, the woman who has everything.

So just what should one  have given the Queen for her  Diamond Jubilee?

The answer, it turns out, is  anything from 60 pieces of onyx  and ancient Yemeni silver jewellery to a dog bed for her corgis in the shape of a crown.

There was also a 1950s Tiffany compact from US president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, two park benches courtesy of the Royal Engineers Association – and a baby llama, which is now happily residing in a zoo somewhere.

The details were included in a list, obtained by the Daily Mail, of gifts presented to members of the royal family last year.

While some given to the Queen were distinctly weird and wonderful, two presented to Prince Andrew  are likely to raise eyebrows for the wrong reasons – a valuable ornamental sword and a box of caviar, courtesy of  the billionaire despot who rules Azerbaijan.

The prince formed close links with president Ilham Aliyev through his role as a trade envoy.

The disclosure will add to growing disquiet over the prince’s relationships with leaders of dubious regimes. While Andrew resigned from his post as a trade ambassador in 2011, he attended several previously arranged engagements last year – and received some generous gifts as a result.

Prince Faisel Bin Abdullah bin Mohammed of the Saudi royal family gave him a painting, while the president of Mongolia gave him an ornamental gold string instrument.

Giving and receiving gifts is considered to be an important part of the royal family’s work in developing good relations with other countries.

Courtiers are supposed to discourage the offering of presents of high monetary value – although this often doesn’t work in reality.

Last year, as befitting her Diamond Jubilee celebration, the Queen received several lavish pieces of jewellery and valuable trinkets.

But many of the hundreds of gifts she received came unsolicited from members of the public, including a wickerwork throne and a model of the state coach made from an ostrich egg.

In all, according to Buckingham 
Palace, members of the public gave her 436 books, 235 CDs and DVDs, 81 
pieces of embroidery or knitting, 78 self-portraits, 40 digital 
photograph books, 28 wall hangings, 19 tea towels and nine jigsaws.

The Duke of Edinburgh didn’t miss out,
 either. He received – rather oddly – a set of Swarovski binoculars for 
his 91st birthday, among other gifts.

The lists released yesterday do not 
include those of Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall or the Duke and
 Duchess of Cambridge, who compile theirs separately.

From the President of Mongolia there was an ornamental gold string instrument and from the President of Kuwait three boxes, once again descriptions of which are not included.

Helpfully, given his love of the game,
 he was also gifted a golf pitch repairer from an admiring member of the
 public and a luxury Aspinal iPad case  worth around £250.

The
 Queen receives dozens in the course of her official duties but most are
 of historical value or small, well-meaning gifts from members of the 
public.

Last year, as 
befitting her Diamond Jubilee celebration, she received several lavish 
pieces of jewellery and valuable trinkets including two silver café au 
lait pots from Mappin and Webb, a Jaeger-LeCoultre wrist watch and a 
boxed set of gold, silver and bronze Olympic medals – as well as her own
 laminated Olympic park security pass.

Many
 of the hundreds she received, however, came unsolicited from members of
 the public including her own wickerwork throne, a model of the state 
coach made from an ostrich eggs, and a knitted tea cosy featuring 
herself and the corgis.

In all, according to Buckingham Palace, members of the public gave her: 436 books, 235 CDs and DVDs, 81 pieces of embroidery or knitting, 78 self-portraits, 40 digital photograph books, 28 wall hangings or bunting, 19 tea towels and nine jigsaws.

Other gifts included honorary ownership of a baby llama and the adoption of a baby Asian elephant.

The Duke of Edinburgh, bizarrely, got a set of Swarovski binoculars for his 91st birthday, while Princess Anne received, among hundreds of relatively small gifts, a set of spurs and a horse blanker.

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester picked up an I Play The Songs CD by Dick Clark on a trip to San Francisco and complimentary membership of  Godalming Leisure Centre in Surrey.

The Countess of Wessex, who the Mail revealed was controversially given two lavish sets of jewels by the despotic Bahraini royal family in 2011, was once again on the receiving end of some fabulous pieces.

The Amir of Kuwait gave her a necklace, earrings and a ring last November while her husband, Prince Edward, was given a designer watch.

Officially, the jewels are not considered to be her personal property, even if she wears them regularly. If they were, she would have to pay tax on them.

On her death they must, ostensibly at least, be passed on to the monarch, who will then decide whether they should be handed over to the Royal Collection or lent to her successors.

Regulations regarding the classification of royal gifts were brought in after it emerged that Prince Charles had personally pocketed £23,000 from secretly selling on a number of the gifts he received from wealthy benefactors through his trusted valet Michael Fawcett, dubbed Fawcett the Fence.

It also emerged that he regularly handed over less valuable items to members of his household, who also went on to profit from them.

Since then, members of the Royal Family have been barred from selling or exchanging gifts.

Each one received must be logged and either used by the receiver, displayed in one of the Royal palaces or stored in one of their warehouses and should be traceable at all times.
