Accused: Leslie Boyd Altstatt has not worked as a doctor since the mid-1980s but he faces charges of sexual assault that range from 1964 to 1982

A retired pediatrician has been arrested after three female relatives accused him of sexually assaulting them decades ago when they were children.

Leslie Boyd Altstatt has not worked as a doctor since the mid-1980s but he faces charges of sexual assault that range from 1964 to 1982.

During that time, he worked as a pediatrician and researcher at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in D.C. and police fear that because of this role, he had access to many other children who could have been victims but have not come forward.

The 83-year-old doctor has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer argued that Altstatt never worked as a doctor at the military medical facility but only as a researcher.

He is charged with child abuse, five counts of committing a third-degree sex offense and six counts of committing an unnatural and perverted sex practice.

The three women, who have not been named due to the nature of the crimes, are said to be related to the accused and their families were said to be close with Altstatt but something happened recently and the women called the Montgomery County police department two months ago to lodge a complaint.

The Washington Post reports that the first victim talked to him about the abuse and he denied the accusations and then admitted to the same accusations later.

The second alleged victim confronted Altstatt several times over the years and 'he apologized for his behavior'.

Back in the day: The alleged abuse took place when Altstatt worked at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which closed in 2011, though he claims he did not have access to young patients

Local station WJLA reports that Altstatt admitted to wrongdoing but his lawyer does not support that claim.

'I
 am unaware of any admissions of any nature... He will certainly plead 
not guilty when the opportunity presents itself,' attorney Richard Finci
 told WJLA.

The first victim said that the abuse started in 1964 when she was 10-years-old.

That victim claims that the abuse carried on for four years.

The specific details about what exactly happened have not been revealed for any of the victims, but the charges against Altstatt imply that they are sexual in nature.

The second victim had a similar situation, as her abuse began a year after the first and lasted for four years as well. Her age at the time of the abuse has not been reported.

The third victim was the youngest and her abuse reported spanned nearly a decade.

She was 6-years-old in 1972 when the abuse reportedly began and she was abused 'hundred of times' before it stopped when she was 15-years-old.

That timeline between these three victims would put the abuse as beginning in 1964 and ending in 1981.

Boyd had to bring a portable oxygen tank with breathing tubes because he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

'I was appalled to see my client wheezing during the hearing,' his attorney Richard Finci told The Washington Post.

Boyd is in hospice care and has lived in Silver Spring, Maryland for decades without causing any alarm to his neighbors.

'It's not somebody you would consider a predator, that you'd be afraid to have in your family,' neighbor Sharon Kornely told WJLA.
