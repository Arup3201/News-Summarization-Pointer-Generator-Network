A lottery winner who bought a Grade II listed mansion with his wife after taking home a £148million fortune has moved his stable girl fiancée into the £6million property, it was reported today.

Adrian Bayford and his ex-wife Gillian bought the seven-bedroom Suffolk home shortly after winning the EuroMillions jackpot in August 2012.

But the couple, originally from Haverhill, Suffolk, moved out of the Georgian home after announcing their separation just 15 months after winning the jackpot.

Lottery winner Adrian Bayford, 43, has reportedly moved in to the £6million Suffolk mansion he bought with his ex-wife Gillian with his new financée Samantha Burbidge, 27

Mr Bayford met stable girl Ms Birbidge, pictured, at his local pub earlier this year. In March, the couple confirmed they were to marry in a James Bond themed wedding after a whirlwind romance

Now, Mr Bayford, 43, has moved his new fiancée Samantha Burbidge, 27, in to the Grade II listed country property, according to a friend of Mr Bayford.

Richard Hudspith, 40, said the new lovers were already settled in the multi-million-pound Suffolk home.

Another friend is said to have joked: 'They'll be Lord and Lady of the manor.'

The couple were previously living at a £750,000 property in Haverhill, Suffolk, which Mr Bayford bought and moved in to following his divorce.

The Bayfords were the second biggest lottery winners in British history when they scooped £148million two years ago.

Just a year later in November 2013 the couple split - citing the stresses of their win for the breakdown of their nine-year marriage.

The Bayfords, pictured in 2012, were the second biggest lottery winners in British history when they took home a £148million jackpot. But they split a year later due to the stress of their win

The couple told the media their relationship had ‘broken down irretrievably’ following their win - and they were officially divorced earlier this year.

At the time, Mr Bayford said: 'Gillian and I have split. When you win the lottery it’s so stressful.’

Shortly after the split, it was reported that mother-of-two Mrs Bayford, 42, was in a relationship with married gardener Chris Tovey, 40.

However, the former healthcare worker has always strenuously denied these claims.

Then, at the end of last year, it was speculated that Mrs Bayford was in a relationship with car dealer Alan Warnock.

Mr Warnock sold Mrs Bayford a fleet of Audis when she visited his dealership - which is near to her hometown of Dundee.

The couple are now thought to be living on the outskirts of the Scottish city in an exclusive estate bought by Mrs Bayford.

Mr Bayford was previously linked to former sausage factory worker Marta Joarosz, pictured. However the Polish-born 30-year-old said she just worked for the multi-millionaire as his driver and bodyguard

In February this year, it was suggested that Mr Bayford was 'being comforted' by former sausage factory worker Marta Jarosz, 30.

However, Polish-born Ms Jarosz claimed she was employed by the multi-millionaire as his driver and bodyguard - and that the two were not romantically linked.

When asked about his relationship with Ms Jarosz, Mr Bayford said: ‘I am not with Marta. She works for me and that’s it.’

In March this year, Mr Bayford confirmed he was seeing a stable girl 16 years his junior.

It is thought Mr Bayford met Ms Burbidge, who worked in a stable near to the Georgian property where the couple will now live, at a local pub.

Six weeks later it was announced the pair were engaged to be married.

Mr Bayford previously lived with Ms Burbidge at this five-bedroom property in Haverhill, Suffolk - which he moved in to following his separation with Mrs Bayford

It is understood Mr Bayford proposed to Ms 
Burbidge during a candlelit dinner on the beach while they were on holiday at a
 plush £500-a-night resort in the Maldives.

The couple then celebrated their engagement with steak, chips and pints of cider at a Suffolk pub with friends

It is thought the wedding will be James Bond themed - and the bride will walk down the aisle to the 007 theme tune.

Her groom will wear a white suit like that of Francisco Scaramanga - the villain of 1974 Bond film The Man With The Golden Gun.
