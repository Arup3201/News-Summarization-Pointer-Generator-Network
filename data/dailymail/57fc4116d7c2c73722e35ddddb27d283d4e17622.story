Justice Secretary Ken Clarke will also slash the time period before convictions become 'spent'

Hundreds of thousands of criminals will have their convictions wiped under ‘rehabilitation’ plans revealed last night.

Rapists, paedophiles and even some killers will overnight be relieved of any obligation to declare their crimes when applying for a job.

Justice Secretary Ken Clarke will also slash the time period before convictions become ‘spent’, to help criminals get back into work.

Yesterday ministers said it was right that criminals had a ‘fair chance of getting back on the straight and narrow’.

The Government admitted the changes could expose some employers to ‘greater risk of harm through their re-offending’. But it insisted the risk was ‘small’ because reoffending rates decline sharply within a few years of release.

Previously, anyone given a jail sentence of more than two and a half years would have to declare their offence to prospective employers for the rest of their lives.

From next year, that will apply only to those given a sentence of more than four years – meaning many more serious offenders will be able to declare themselves ‘clean’ after a period of time has elapsed.

Serious offenders with a sentence of between 30 months and four years will no longer have to declare their convictions after seven years. This will include some killers with manslaughter convictions, as well as rapists and paedophiles.

Sentences of between six months and 30 months – the kind given to violent thugs and drug dealers – will expire after four years instead of the current ten.

And those given up to six months in jail, which can include burglars, will be clear after two years instead of seven.

But the time periods will be calculated from the end of the sentence, instead of the date of conviction as is currently the case.

Rapists, paedophiles and even some killers will overnight be relieved of any obligation to declare their crimes when applying for a job

Court fines will be expunged after one year rather than five, and the same will apply to community sentences.

The
rules will also be retrospective, meaning criminals who committed 
serious crimes in the distant past will benefit immediately.  

Last
night David Green, director of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘There are
some employers who are willing to give people a second chance and 
that’s a good thing. But it’s better if they know they have a doubtful 
history.

‘By spending 
convictions rapidly you are deceiving people. These days no one gets put
in prison unless they have done something pretty bad. I think this is 
sending the wrong message.’

Jailed: Muhammed Tayyab sexually assaulted a teenager and punched her in the face

Muhammed Tayyab sexually assaulted a teenager and punched her in the face in an ordeal lasting nearly an hour.

The 38-year-old was jailed for four years last November, but under the new rules he would have his conviction wiped seven years after the end of his sentence. Currently he would have to declare the conviction to prospective employers for the rest of his life.

Tayyab grabbed the 19-year-old after she left her friends in a bar and pulled her into a recess on Blackpool Promenade. The 45-minute attack in the early hours of May 6 last year only came to an end when the woman was able to remove his hand from her mouth and begin screaming, alerting three passers-by.

Police said CCTV showed Tayyab hanging around outside the bar  waiting for his victim, then following her when she left. Officers said he picked the woman, who was celebrating a friend’s birthday, because she was drunk and vulnerable.

Tayyab admitted the offence at Preston Crown Court and was ordered to serve four years for the sexual assault, with a four-month sentence for the punch in the face to be  served concurrently.

Detective Constable Alan Quanbrough, from Blackpool CID, described the assault as ‘particularly nasty and violent’.

‘It was only by luck three men walked past and the victim was eventually able to get away,’ he added. ‘She was able to scream and Tayyab’s prolonged attack was interrupted.’

Police were able to track down the attacker because he was wearing his work name badge at the time of the assault.

The victim, who was visiting from Manchester for a couple of nights, was left bruised and shaken after the attack.

Officials insisted that indeterminate sentences for public protection would never be spent, nor would new extended sentences for the most serious sexual and violent crimes.

Once a conviction is spent, employers cannot refuse to give an applicant a job or dismiss an employee because of it.

Spent convictions will no longer show up in a basic Criminal Records Bureau check. But offenders will have to declare them when applying to work in schools, prisons or other ‘sensitive’ environments.

Justice Minister Lord McNally said: ‘First and foremost, criminals must be suitably punished for their crimes. But it is no good for anyone if they go to jail and come out and then can’t get an honest job and so turn back to crime again.’
