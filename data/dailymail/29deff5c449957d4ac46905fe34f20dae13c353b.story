Two-goal hero Thomas Muller has admitted that his side couldn't have wished for better start after Oleksandr Kucher's red card inside four minutes for Shakhtar Donetsk gave them a man advantage and a penalty - which he dispatched confidently.

Pep Guardiola's side were unforgiving after that crucial moment and struck seven past the sorry Ukrainians at the Allianz Arena.

With the score poised at 0-0 after the first leg, Muller knew that his side needed a fast start and that was exactly what they got.

'We took the lead after a couple of minutes and they went a man down. If you were going to wish for anything it would be that, but it's not something we were expecting either,' he told the official Bayern website.

'Donetsk were in real trouble after the second and third goals. Their heads went down, which gave us lots of space – and we used it.

'The situation going into the game was definitely more exciting than the match itself. The course of the match was excellent for us.'
