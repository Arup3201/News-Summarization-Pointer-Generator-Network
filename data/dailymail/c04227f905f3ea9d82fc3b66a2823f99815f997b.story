Blood smeared across his face from his nose to his left ear, it was a fitting image to mark Nemanja Vidic’s last game for Manchester United. This is one warrior who was always likely to go out on his shield.

The flailing arm from Southampton’s Rickie Lambert was far from the first time Vidic has taken one for the team, nor will it be the last as he changes colours and heads for Inter Milan after more than eight years at Old Trafford. In a country known for tough defenders, Italy is about to inherit one of the toughest.

Brave: Vidic fittingly bowed out with a bloodied nose after United's draw at Southampton

United have had their fair share of them down the years: think Gordon McQueen, Kevin Moran, Steve Bruce and Jaap Stam. The Serbian has raised the bar even higher.

‘He puts his head where people are scared to put their feet,’ said teammate Robin van Persie after Vidic played his last game at Old Trafford. ‘That’s Nemanja. He wants to die for the cause, in a good way. He is very brave, a great player and he’s won everything at Manchester United.’

From the moment Vidic arrived for £7million in the 2006 January transfer window, the first signing of the Glazer era, it was clear that United had found themselves a true leader – someone who had captained Red Star Belgrade to the Serbian title at a young age before enhancing his fearsome reputation at Spartak Moscow.

Flying high: Vidic chipped in with more than his fair share of goals for United over the years

There were childhood tales of growing up in Uzice, a town one hundred miles from Belgrade that was targeted for American and NATO bombing raids. United fans embraced the legend, even though heir tribute song to Vidic might not be the most politically correct in English football.

It was sung in full cry last Tuesday when Vidic made his farewell appearance at Old Trafford against Hull City before taking the microphone to say his goodbyes on the pitch afterwards and thank them ‘from the bottom of my heart’.

In the match programme that night, he tried to play down the importance of him leaving United. ‘It shouldn’t be so dramatic,’ said Vidic. ‘A lot of players leave the club and a lot come here. United will always be the same and will always attract good, big-name players. I don’t think it will be any different when the transfer market starts.

‘Last year Paul Scholes retired. Before that, it was Gary Neville. That’s life and yet you still see these players around the club and supporting the club. I will be no different.’

History will show his contribution to be rather more significant, however. It is hard to think of a better central defensive partnership in the Premier League era than that forged by Vidic and Rio Ferdinand.

It saw the Serbian win the title in five of the eight full seasons that he played at Old Trafford, not to mention a Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup and three League Cups.

Vidic was the proverbial rock at the heart of defence, while Ferdinand was the ball player. It felt like the perfect combination. Very few players got the better of Vidic, even though United fans were right to get nervous every time he came up against Liverpool, and Fernando Torres and then Luis Suarez in particular.

He was a gladiator, fearsome and fearless in equal measure. Images of Vidic holding his head after another juddering collision while a physio sponged the blood of his face or asked him to count the fingers in front of his eyes like a punch-drunk boxer will live on.

Some believe that he was never quite the same after badly damaging the ligaments in his right knee during a Champions League game against Basle in December 2011, but Vidic soldiered on.

Saturday’s final appearance at St Mary’s was his 300th for United. Only 10 of those have come off the bench. His leaving present was an elbow to the nose from Lambert. Vidic wouldn’t have it any other way.
