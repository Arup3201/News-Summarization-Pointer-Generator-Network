The six-bedroom home in Chicago was once the home of Al Capone and is on sale for $225,000 

This double sink could have been in the house when it was owned by Al Capone in the 1920s 

This front room is where the wake of Capone's brother Frank was held after his murder in 1924

According to the real estate listing: 'This was Al Capone's Chicago home. Wow, there are three bedrooms on each floor.'

The listing states that the first floor was reconditioned in 2008 and a new kitchen was installed. There is even a Jacuzzi in one of the two bathrooms. 

The second floor comes equipped with hardwood floors and there is a garage which will fit two cars. 

However, any crime fans looking to visit the house 'must show proof of funds before showing'.  

The Chicago Tribune reports Capone purchased the Chicago home for $5,500 as he worked as a bouncer in a brothel before he became Prohibition-era America's most infamous gangster 

Capone buys 7244 Prairie Avenue in 1923 and moves in his wife, son, mother as well as his brother and sisters. 

The house is located in the Greater Grand Crossing area in south Chicago.  

His brother Frank is waked in the front room of the house after he was shot and killed by the Chicago Police Department in April 1924 while trying to intimidate people trying to vote.

Capone purchased the Chicago home for $5,500 as he worked as a bouncer in a brothel before he became Prohibition-era America's most infamous gangster who was eventually prosecuted for tax evasion 

When he moved to Chicago, Capone took over the running of the Four Deuces club where it is believed that people were tortured in basement. 

In the late 1920s Capone moved to Florida after a failed attempt on his life, although members of his family continued to live in the house.  

His career as a gangster ended when he was jailed for 11 years on October 24, 1931 for tax evasion. Authorities were unable to convict him for any of the numerous gangland murders, racketeering and prostitution offences he was suspected of. 

He was released from Alcatraz prison in 1939 and died in 1947.

At the height of his powers, Capone's criminal enterprises were earning an estimated $100 million a year.

According to recent estimates, in today's money the man who was the son of penniless Italian immigrants would have been a billionaire at the time of his death.  

According to the real estate agents the kitchen was refurbished in in 2008 

The property in the Greater Grand Crossing area in south Chicago features six bedrooms 

As befitting the former home of a gangster, there is plenty of security at the front door of the house 

The home has a rather large basement area although it is believed Capone only tortured people at his club 

The property features a stand-alone garage which was used by Capone to make a quick getaway 

According to the real estate agents, anyone looking to view the house must provide proof of funds 

Capone moved his wife, son, mother as well as brothers and sisters into the house in 1923

Potential purchases may not want to think too closely about what caused these stains on the floor
