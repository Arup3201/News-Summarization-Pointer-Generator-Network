A young California woman was recently arrested and charged in connection to the death of a well-known 66-year-old millionaire who was tied up and killed in his mansion last month.

Ravel Chanel Dixon, 22, a single mother and college student, was reportedly arrested on Tuesday for a different crime before her link to the murder of high-profile investor Raveesh Kumra was made.

Police had busted her for allegedly offering sex, drugs or money to an undercover cop.

Charged in connection to homicide: The visibly frightened Dixon, of Alameda County, California, was charged with 'accessory after the fact' in the November 30 killing of 66-year-old millionaire investor Raveesh Kumra

But Dixon, of Alameda County, was charged on Friday with 'accessory after the fact' in the November 30 killing of Kumra, an investor who owned Western Cellular Management, NBC News reports.

Kumra is best known for owning Mountain Winery in the 1990s. 

His ex-wife, Harinder 'Rani' Kumra, was also home at their large villa in Monte Sereno and was tied up during the attack.

The couple were divorced but had remained cordial, according to a family statement.

Rani Kumra told police she believed three or four people had entered the family's mansion on Withey Road.

She told police that she and her husband were tied up at about 1:30am.

More to the story: Dixon is not being charged with the homicide. A sketch of a possible suspect in the case shows a tall, skinny man in his early 20s who has black hair

Police released a statement on Friday saying they do not believe the homicide of Raveesh Kumra was a random act of violence.

Authorities have not yet explained how he was killed or who killed him.

Dixon is not being charged with the homicide.

A sketch of a possible suspect in the case was released by Los Gatos-Monte Sereno police shortly after the homicide was reported.

The sketch shows a tall, skinny man in his early 20s who has black hair.

Dixon’s charges carry a 'gang-enhancement' charge, court officials say. Prosecutors did not clarify what that meant.

Outside of the court, Dixon’s mother, Sandra Mitchell, said that her daughter is scared and called the charges ‘very troublesome.’

‘We don't know how they came up with these serious charges. It's an out-of-the-blue charge. They just want someone to charge that homicide to,’ said John Ambrosio, Dixon's attorney.

The police statement said that the department is ‘aware of the concern and anxiety this crime has caused the community and wishes to provide a limited update of the case.’

Dixon’s bail was set at $1million.

Kumra was the first homicide victim in Mountain View, California, in 40 years.
