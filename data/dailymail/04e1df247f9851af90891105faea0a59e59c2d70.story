Tabraiz Hussain has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing - to get rid of his stash during a car chase

A drug dealer has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing -  to get rid of his stash during a car chase.

Tabraiz Hussain became involved in a police chase while driving to an address in the Park End area of Middlesbrough, on September 8 last year.

Teesside Crown Court heard how Hussain was followed by police before he then led them on a pursuit round a 'heavily-populated estate' for several minutes before trying to throw the class A drug out of the window.

The drug then burst all over him, his car and the pavement in a snow-like covering as he tried to get rid of it.

Prosecuting Aisha Wadoodi told the court: 'The defendant refused to stop, exceeding the speed limit and driving on the wrong side of the road. 

'He only stopped once he mounted the pavement after a close collision with parked cars.'

Police used vacuum cleaners to suck up the drugs scattered on the road and from the defendant's clothes. 

Once measured, they estimated the drugs to amount to one kilo, with a street value of almost £16,000.

The 34-year-old, admitted he was in possession of class A but claimed he was instructed by someone else to collect the package, and was paid £300.

A pair of gloves and three tampered mobile phones were also recovered.

The court heard how months earlier the father-of-two had arranged for a taxi to transport an associate to collect a supply of heroin from Manchester.

The trip had been organised through a long-term friend of the defendant who paid £220 for the fare.

The court heard that during the journey, at least 13 calls were made between the defendant and his co-conspirator who exchanged passwords and a postcode.

On the way back to Middlesbrough, police stopped the car and recovered just under two kilos of heroin, with a street value of about £97,000, which was stored in a McDonald's paper bag.

Hussain initially denied conspiracy to supply class A drugs but changed his plea to guilty on the day of his trial.

He also pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A and dangerous driving.

Defending Rachael Sewell said her client 'accepted fully' that he organised a taxi in order to pick up drugs but did not accept that he was person who was leading the trip.

She said: 'The defendant's role was linked to the taxi only. He did not play a lead role.'

Sentencing him to eight years and six months in prison Judge Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'You, on two occasions were involved in the supply of class A drugs and involved to a significant extent. And it may well be that your involvement may stretch beyond these two incidents.

'You were involved in the transportation of heroin, which on one occasion was just short of 2kg and the other occasion had an estimated amount of 1kg.

'Those involved in supplying drugs of course play different roles, but those closest to the source are the ones who are closest to the final retail on the street.

'There is an unhappy chain of drugs coming from the Manchester area to this area and I am determined to do all that I can to stamp it out.' 

The case has echoes of scenes in Hollywood blockbuster True Romance.

A character, played by Bronson Pinchot, tries to evade police by chucking cocaine from the window of his moving car, only for it bounce back and cover him.

He is stopped for speeding but ultimately arrested for drug possession as an officer is faced with the grinning white faced defendant. 

And in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, Allen - playing the nervy Alvy Singer - covers himself in 'cocaine' after accidentally sneezing into a tray of the drug while at a party.
