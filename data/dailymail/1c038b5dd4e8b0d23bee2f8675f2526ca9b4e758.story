An Australian tourist was lucky to escape with his life after he was mauled by a lion during an African safari tour.

Brendan Smith, from Perth in Western Australia, had landed in Johannesburg in South Africa just 36 hours before the vicious predator jumped through an open car window and attacked him.

In a Facebook post, Mr Smith recalled the terrifying moment he was bitten, with a sense of humour.

Brendan Smith was on an African safari when he mauled by a lion who jumped through a window and bit him

'No later than 36 hours after touching down in Africa I find myself in hospital after a lion jumped through the car window and decided to go to town on my legs,' he wrote.

'Pretty full-on but am alive, with insurance coming to the party and an influx of curious Africans wanting to see "the lion man". 

'Could have and should have been a lot worse but chicks dig scars so I'll be sweet!'

It is believed the Perth man was on safari near Johannesburg and was treated at the city's Fourways Life Hospital.  

Mr Smith (pictured with an unidentified friend) posted pictures of his wounds on Facebook with a recount of the horrifying attack

Mr Smith's wounds appear to be deep in graphic photos uploaded on his Facebook page.

His post also included a picture of two female lions lazing on the grass. 

It is not known if these were the lions that attacked him.

One of the pictures show what looks like teeth puncture marks which have broken through Mr Smith's skin. 

Looking at his page, Mr Smith appears to be an avid adventurer and traveller.

The Perth man said he had escaped with his life and described the experience as 'pretty full-on'

His photos show him skydiving, eating scorpions, jumping through fire hoops and shooting at a gun range.

His dad, Brian Smith, said he was relieved to hear his son was safe.

'So glad it's not worse. Very lucky lad. You will be in pain for weeks,' Brian wrote on social media.

'I think u should cut your losses and get on the next plane home after hospital. Take care.'

Friends also expressed their concern for the injured Australian by leaving messages of sympathy under his post.

'You are one lucky son of a b**** - sort of :-S hope you're on the mend dude and can enjoy the rest of your trip,' one friend wrote.

Another well-wisher expressed their shock at the news.

'Oh my god! You have survived some pretty crazy travel adventures, but this takes the cake,' she said.

'Imagine this story at the pub in 40 years time. Sending you loads of love & well wishes xx.'

Mr Smith was planning to continue on to a shark dive in Gansbaai - south of Cape Town - from his safari, but now he is unsure if his plans will still go ahead as he is in hospital.
