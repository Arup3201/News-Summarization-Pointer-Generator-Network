Martin Skrtel  has warned Liverpool’s top-four rivals they should be ready to fight as they look to take momentum from his ‘most important’ goal.

The Slovakian defender had eight staples put into a head wound following a clash with Olivier Giroud but carried on with a bandage to score the equaliser deep into injury time in Sunday’s dramatic 2-2 draw with Arsenal at Anfield.

Liverpool have a chance to push on over Christmas with a fixture away to Burnley followed by home games against Swansea and Leicester.

Skrtel knows they have to start showing consistency to fulfil their Champions League ambitions.

Using Arsenal as the barometer for fourth place, though, Skrtel insists Liverpool should not feel daunted, as he maintains there was enough evidence on show on Sunday to prove that Brendan Rodgers’ side have the better prospects for the second half of the campaign.

‘We showed a great performance, we moved the ball well and scored two goals but unfortunately we conceded two as well,’ said Skrtel. ‘It was not an easy game, it was tough as it always is against Arsenal, but if we carry on in this way it can be good for us. In the last three games against Manchester United, Bournemouth and Arsenal we have shown great performances and we need to keep going this way.

‘We showed spirit, fight and desire. It is a good point but we wanted more. To get a point was reward for fighting to the end.

‘The goal and the performance can help turn things around because there has been a lot of criticism of us and I hope it will change and be better in the second half of the season.’

Of his injury, Skrtel added: ‘It was sore afterwards but I was glad I could carry on and be there to the end. I had eight staples. Staples again! I spoke to the doctor on the pitch and he said it would be all right to carry on and I am glad I stayed there.’

Skrtel, who has 18 months left on his contract, is one of 13 defensive players with doubts over their long-term futures at the club.
