Tragic: Susan Wood died after plunging 80 feet from the top floor of Primark in Liverpool city centre

The woman who died after falling from a third-floor balcony inside a Primark store has been named by police as Susan Wood.

The 57-year-old from Kirkby, Merseyside, was found at the bottom of escalators on the ground floor of the clothes shop in Church Street, Liverpool, yesterday evening.

Moments earlier, Mrs Wood had been seen on a balcony next to the escalators on the third floor, police said.

An off-duty doctor, who was shopping at the time, treated her before paramedics arrived.

Mrs
Wood was taken to the Royal University Liverpool Hospital in a critical
condition but was pronounced dead a short time later.

Merseyside
Police is conducting an investigation into the circumstances 
surrounding Mrs Wood's death but the coroner has been told there are no 
suspicious circumstances, the force said.

Detectives have been speaking to witnesses and CCTV has been examined.

Artist
Brian Gibson, from Everton, was just getting off the escalator in the 
menâ€™s department in the basement level when he heard the impact.

Investigation: Police outside the Liverpool Primark store, where Susan Wood died after falling three floors

Grim discovery: Mrs Wood's body was discovered at the bottom of the escalator on the ground floor. Moments earlier shoppers said she was spotted on the third floor

'Unexplained': Merseyside Police have ruled out any foul play in the incident

'At first I thought it was a dummy that had fallen but then I realised that someone had fallen from one of the floors above.

'The impact was incredible. The poor lad on the escalator behind me was shaking.

'People were crying and then they evacuated everyone and the police cordoned off the area.'

Another witness said: 'It was horrific, staff were crying and there was a call-out for any medics in the shop to come and help out.'

A North West Ambulance spokeswoman confirmed that paramedics had taken the woman to the Royal Liverpool hospital.

She said: 'The woman suffered a traumatic cardiac arrest at the scene and was treated by paramedics. She was taken to hospital in a critically ill condition.'

Around three hours later police confirmed the woman had died in hospital.

The incident is the second major fall at the city's store.

In 2008 Evie Parry, three, survived after slipping through a gap close to the third-floor escalator.

She suffered multiple injuries including a broken leg and arm.

First aid: Shoppers and staff rushed to help the woman. An off-duty doctor gave first aid until paramedics arrived

Evacuated: Police officers closed the store and staff were sent home. In 2008, Evie Parry, right, survived after slipping and falling from the third floor of the same branch

The police spokesman said: 'Officers were called to the Primark store in Church Street at 6pm by paramedics.

'The woman was found at the bottom of escalators on the ground floor. She had been seen moments before by a balcony next to the escalators on the third floor.

'A male doctor who was in the area at the time treated the woman at the scene before paramedics arrived.

'She was taken in a critical condition to hospital where she was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

'A post-mortem will be carried out in due course to establish a cause of death.

'Detectives are speaking to witnesses and viewing CCTV to establish the full circumstances of the incident.'

A Primark spokesman said staff were 'extremely saddened' by the incident but he said he was unable to comment further.

Liverpool City Council said they were waiting for the results of the police investigation before taking a decision on whether to investigate safety at the store.
