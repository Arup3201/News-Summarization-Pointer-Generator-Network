A top London hotel chain has today been called 'despicable beyond belief' for using the Paris terror attacks to promote its new venture in the French capital.

The  Hoxton Hotel used the JeSuisCharlie hashtag with a set of pictures of its new hotel with the caption: 'very chic don't you think?'.

The chain posted pics of their new venture on Facebook along with the phrase used by millions to show support for the victims of the French terror attacks.

The group, which has since apologised and deleted the post, caused uproar over the online advert.

Upsetting: The Hoxton Hotel chain has apologised after it used the JeSuisCharlie hashtag to promote its new hotel in Paris 

Support: The phrase he 'Je Suis Charlie' became a sign of support for freedom of speech after the Paris terror attacks last week and the hashtag has become one of the most popular in the history of Twitter

It read: 'Proud to be opening our second European hotel in Paris 2016. Very chic don't you think? #‎jesuischarile‬ (sic)'. 

One Facebook used posted on its page: 'This is despicable beyond belief - I'm never going to stay in one of their hotels, and I strongly encourage everybody else with a shred of self-awareness to do the same.'

Another asked: 'Did you really just use a hashtag meant to remember murdered innocents to promote your hotel?

Abi Silvester wrote: 'Using #jesuischarlie to promote your business - with a typo in the hashtag? Nice one, The Hoxton.' 

A spokesman for The Hoxton said: 'A member of our team posted renderings of our upcoming hotel opening in Paris.

'At the end of the post £jesuischarlie was used to show our solidarity with the victims of the attacks in Paris.

Regret: The company said it was an innocent but unacceptable mistake and they have deleted the post 

'In no way was it our intention to use these atrocities to promote our new hotel.

'This would not only be completely insensitive but unacceptable in our eyes.

'In hindsight, it was extremely poor judgement and clearly not intended to be perceived in the way it has.

'We have since removed the post on Facebook and we would like to sincerely apologise for any offence it may have caused.'
