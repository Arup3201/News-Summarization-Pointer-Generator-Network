The parents of a nine-month-old northwest Missouri boy who died after being accidentally shot in the head by his five-year-old brother will not be charged.

Alexis Wiederholt, 24,  made a frantic call to police in the small town of Elmo after her five-year-old son told her 'I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin'.

The infant was flown 120 miles away to a hospital in Kansas City, where he was pronounced dead.

Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice announced Friday that Mrs Wiederholt and her father Bill Porter would not be charged with criminal negligence for the 'tragic accident' at the grandfather's home.

Mr Porter owned multiple guns, including the .22-caliber magnum revolver used to shoot his grandson, according to the St. Joseph News-Press.

Both he and his daughter, who lives in North Dakota with her husband but was visiting her father before a National Guard stint, believed that the weapons were empty and stored in a gun safe.

The revolver was kept in a shelf built into Mr Porter's headboard in the same room where Corbin was in a playpen.

Mr Rice said that the weapon was not in plain sight. 

Mrs Widerholt originally thought that her five-year-old had shot her baby with a paintball gun before finding out that he had been shot in the head with a handgun.

'I walked in and there was my baby, lying there, bleeding,' the young mother told NBC News.

'I had just hugged him in my arms five minutes before that.'

Mrs Widerholt was home alone with her children and doing laundry at the time of the tragic shooting

She was home alone with her children doing laundry at the time of the tragic shooting, according to the Maryville Daily Forum.

Mrs Wiederholt revealed that she had no idea her father even kept a loaded gun in the home.

'I didn't know it was there until I turned around and saw it laying on the bed,' she said. 

Porter said of the tragedy; 'I told the boys they weren't supposed to be in my bedroom where I keep the gun cabinet and they knew it — but like I said, boys will be boys.'  

Neighbor Jessica Hutchison, said: 'I think that gun safety could have come into play and would have maybe prevented the situation. It's just really sad altogether.' 

The Wiederholt children are five, three, and one-and-a-half years old.

A Child Fatality Review Board recommended that Mrs Wiederholt and her father not be charged shortly after the incident.

Criminal negligence occurs when someone 'fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will follow, and such failure constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation' according to Missouri law. 

An average of 62 children are shot unintentionally each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
