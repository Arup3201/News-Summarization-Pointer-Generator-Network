Excavator operator Juha-Pekka Peramaki sure has a soft touch.

A new video that has gone viral shows Mr Peramaki operating the claws of a Hitachi ZX210, a machine designed to move heavy construction materials and dig up terrain, to snap together Lego blocks.

In an absolutely mind-blowing feat, the man uses his 23-tonne excavator to pick up the tiny pieces without crushing them and carefully lower them into place.

With incredible precision and control, Peramaki is able to snap the toys together without crushing the plastic

So how is he able to pull off such a precise task?

Much of his control can be attributed to his expert use of the machine's Engcon tiltrotator, which sits between the excavator's massive arm and the grabber.

The tiltrotator allows Peramaki to angle the claws up to 45 degrees and rotate them a full 360 degrees.

At the end of the video, the camera zooms out to show Peramaki's vantage point, where one can barely make out the surface, let alone the details on the tiny toys.

Everything is awesome: Peramaki places the  toy man and chair onto the red truck base

Voila! Peramaki's miniature masterpiece, constructed using his Hitachi ZX210
