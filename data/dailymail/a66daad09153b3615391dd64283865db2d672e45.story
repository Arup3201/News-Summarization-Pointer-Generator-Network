Beyonce, Anne Hathaway and Gwyneth Paltrow swear by the raw vegan lifestyle for keeping their health in check and it seems the A-lister's way of life is catching on.

Saskia Gregson-Williams, a professional ballerina and food blogger who lives in London, was left depressed for years suffering with chronic eczema until she learnt how to cure herself via diet.

Speaking about her ailment, the 17-year-old said: 'I used to describe it as a snood of eczema, as it covered all around my neck and all over the rest of my body. I was never diagnosed with any allergies or given treatments that cured it, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.'

Health kick: Saskia Gregson-Williams, a professional ballerina and food blogger at Naturally Sassy, was left depressed for years suffering with chronic eczema until she learnt how to cure it herself via diet and now she's shared her healthy recipes to help others

With no previous interest in nutrition, she decided to read up on foods that caused inflammation in the body, and found that dairy was one of the prime culprits. 

'I took the radical decision to completely cut dairy out of my diet, and within a month my eczema had disappeared - it was amazing,' she said. 'My eczema had been really mentally weighing me down, it was so sore and inflamed and made me very insecure. The difference in my confidence, energy levels and happiness when it disappeared were really noticeable.' 

That was the first of a long list of changes that Saskia made to her diet and as a ballerina, who trains for eight hours a day, she realised she needed to start fuelling her body with the best possible nutrients.

Finding alternatives: Saskia believes that meat, dairy, sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body and left her feeling lethargic and bloated but she's found healthy versions of her favourite treats

Inspired by Kris Carr, who believes she cured her cancer via her diet and penned the best-seller Crazy Sexy Kris, Saskia became aware of the effect food really does have on your life. 

'The more I learnt, the more passionate I became, and that’s when my culinary adventure really started,' she said. 

She embraced a vegan, gluten-free, sugar-free and wheat-free diet and set up her blog, Naturally Sassy, where she shares recipes and blogs her journey to a healthier lifestyle.

'The Naturally Sassy philosophy is all about embracing food the way nature made it - completely unrefined and unprocessed,' she said. 

High on health: Saskia believes that meat, dairy, sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body but her new diet leaves her feeling energetic and full of life 

'In a nutshell, it is about cooking meals that are packed with nutrients and completely delicious. It is a simple way of eating that creates the flavours you love, naturally. It is not about depriving yourself and allows you to cook indulgent, healthy meals that taste incredible and make you feel great in body and mind.'

Saskia believes that meat, dairy, sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body and left her feeling lethargic and bloated. 

Since cutting them out, she says her mood,  energy levels, and wellbeing has sky-rocketed. 'This way of life took me from being down and depressed to utterly high on health,' she said.

She starts the day with a smoothie bowl full of nuts and superfoods and has big batches of quinoa, lentils, roasted sweet potato wedges and hummus for lunch.

For dinner she creates healthy versions of food so sweet potato and black bean burgers instead of beef burgers and vegetable risottos with a cashew-lemon cream rather than a dairy-based one.

Saskia says that you can create delicious and healthy meals as long as you are creative and many of her recipes come with the disclaimer: 'This recipe may fill you with an abundance of energy, make you feel high on health, and cause effects of extreme happiness.'
