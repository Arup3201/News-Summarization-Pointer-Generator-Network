A block on Chicago’s South Side that first lady Michelle Obama once called home is now regarded as the most dangerous stretch of road in one of the country’s most dangerous cities.

The 6400 block of South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, which includes the sprawling Parkway Gardens low-income apartment complex, has been christened O Block in recent years by the gang members who regularly fight for control of its streets and courtyards.

The O stands for 20-year-old Odee Perry, a member of the Chicago Black Disciples gang, who was shot dead in 2011 - just one of 19 people shot on O Block between June 2011 and June 2014.

The sprawling Parkway Gardens low-income apartment complex on Chicago's South Side has been the battleground for a vicious war between the rival Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples gangs in recent years

That statistic makes it the most dangerous block in Chicago in terms of shootings over that three-year period, reports the Chicago Sun-Times.

Parkway Gardens has become a haven for gangs and nowadays it is the Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples who battle it out for supremacy.

Another name that the gangs have given the area is ‘Wiiic City’ which stands for Wild, Insane, Crazy and their battles are glorified in the lyrics of local rappers such as Chief Keef.  

Yet it was once a very different story as one older residents who has lived in the area for over 25 years recalls.

‘It was nicer back then, flowers planted in the beds, the grass kept up, less violence in and around the complex. You have to watch yourself more these days,’ the unnamed woman told the Sun-Times.

In the early 1960s, Parkway Gardens had been home to the family of Michelle Obama - then Michelle Robinson - and she spent the first two years of her life living there before her family moved in 1965.

In a 2009 interview with Time magazine, she recalled her childhood memories of the complex as ‘a wonderful, small apartment building… but now when I pass it, it’s - I was, like, God, I never saw that apartment in the way that I’m seeing it now.’ 

The difference between the mid-1960s and today is drastic according to Rev. Corey Brooks of the New Beginnings Church of Chicago.

‘The environment was family-focused,’ he told the Sun-Times. ‘People were working. When you eliminate all those things from a community - men not in the household and education failing - it will be a drastic difference than what the first lady of the United States and her family experienced.’

The first lady recalls how the apartment complex was ‘a wonderful, small apartment building' but said when she passed the area in recent years if felt very different to how it was in the mid-1960s as rival gangs have taken over the once thriving area 

Fortunately statics show that a change in policing in the area, suggested by a Yale sociologist who’s studied crime in Chicago, may be having an impact and the number of shootings is down. 

Since 2012, the number of shootings in Beat 312, which includes O Block, is down by 59 percent through September, the police say.

In an effort to curb the violence, the police drew an 'impact zone' of five square blocks around O Block in February 2013 and more officers were assigned to patrol the area on foot.  

Strategies were also put in place to help identify potential troublemakers, while special attention was also paid to monitoring social media for threats between gang members.

In the 20 months prior to the 'impact zone' strategy there were 32 shootings, while in the first 20 months since then there have only been 10 shootings.

A clear sign of progress according to Alderman Willie Cochran (20th), a former police sergeant whose ward includes O Block.

'The presence and quick response of officers has deterred crime recently,' he said. 'We have not solved it 100 percent. But there has been a host of actions that have been taken.'
