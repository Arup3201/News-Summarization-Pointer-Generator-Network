Designer Tommy Hilfiger took the phrase 'fantasy football' to new heights during his fall/winter 2015 30th anniversary catwalk show at New York Fashion Week on Monday morning, parading a bevvy of beautiful, leather and fur-clad models down his custom-designed catwalk-turned-football field. 

Staying true to the preppy, collegiate-inspired style that his brand is best known for, the 63-year-old designer showcased a collection of old school designs, including varsity jackets, plaid-print sweaters and skirts, and retro football jerseys, all of which had been given a modern twist with textured fabrics, metallic accents and fur accessories.

Speaking about the inspiration behind his collection on Saturday, Mr Hilfiger said that he had drawn on classic 'athletic themes' from the 60s and 70s and given them a 'modern, elevated twist'.

The name of the game: Mr Hilfiger clearly had the frosty winter weather in mind when designing this collection, which included fur sweaters paired with thick pleated skirts, and woolen cardigans accessorized with thick tights and high-heeled winter boots

'Think Ali MacGraw in Love Story meets the modern street style muse,' he added to InStyle.  

With the frosty winter weather clearly at the forefront of his mind, Mr Hilfiger's new collection included a number of cozy ensembles; fur skirts paired with oversized sweaters, woolen cardigans accessorized with thick tights and collegiate-style scarves, and thick leather football jerseys worn with sky-high heeled winter boots. 

Model of the moment Gigi Hadid, fresh from featuring on the cover of Spanish Vogue, strutted her stuff down the 'grassy' field wearing an oversized hooded leather raincoat, which featured wide blue and white stripes, a plaid lining and was emblazoned with a large football logo.

Other stand-out ensembles included Jourdan Dunn's leather football jersey-style mini dress, which paid homage to Mr Hilfiger's unwavering patriotism courtesy of its red, white and blue coloring. 

Bundle up: The fall/winter 2015 show also featured a number of cozy-looking outwear, including chic capes, metallic varsity jackets and thick striped sweaters

Fall focus: Mr Hilfiger's autumnal color palette featured a variety of deep blues, reds and burgundy shades 

A coat for all occasions: The collection included metallic varsity-style jackets and warm shearling coats

Finale: The models paraded along the football field together at the end of the athletic show 

In celebration of the brand's 30th anniversary, Mr Hilfiger revealed shortly before the show that many of the styles featured on his catwalk would be readily available in his online store for customers to purchase even as the fashion show was still going on. 

'Our inspiration this season is rooted in one of the most iconic and inclusive American past-times: football,' Mr Hilfiger said in a statement last Friday. 

'This Fall we will celebrate our 30th anniversary with limited-edition product available to our consumers the moment the look steps onto the runway. 

'We will also continue to introduce innovative digital technology that democratizes the event and invites everyone to view the show in expanded, engaging ways.'

Many of the limited edition commemorative designs, such as a $190 faux fur sweater and a $550 faux fur vest, have already sold out in most sizes, with just a few smaller options left available. 

As always, the show drew a slew of famous faces to its front row, with singer Rita Ora attending alongside her boyfriend, Mr Hilfiger's son Rich - who is more commonly known by his rapper name Ricky Hil. 

Rita, 24, took to Instagram to heap praise on her potential future father-in-law, saying: 'Congratulations on 30 years. Legend and amazing human being.' 

Front row regular Olivia Palermo was also a guest of honor, as was her husband, model Johannes Huebl, while designer Rachel Zoe and her husband Rodger Berman were also snapped enjoying a post-show chat backstage with Mr Hilfiger and his wife Dee.
