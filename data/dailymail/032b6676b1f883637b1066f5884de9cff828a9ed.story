He’s jumped from the Eiffel Tower and flown through a waterfall in the Swiss Alps, now wingsuit stuntman Jeb Corliss has hurtled through a 20-foot crack in a Chinese mountain in what he has called the most technically demanding jump of his life.

Corliss – dubbed The Flying Dagger – began his stunt by leaping out of a helicopter wearing a wingsuit that has thin membranes between the limbs and torso.

He then flew towards Mount Jianglang – which stands at 900-feet – and zoomed through a fissure in it that measured between 15 and 60 feet in width and three football fields in length.

The daredevil had just four-feet of space either side of him and deployed his parachute just 300 feet above the ground. 

He wrote on Facebook afterwards: 'The weather opened for one hour and I nailed the stunt perfect. I flew through from beginning to end.

'Had a perfect opening and just barely made my landing area. It was without a doubt the most technically demanding jump of my life from exit to flying through the crack to opening to landing. I have never been happier. Thank you everyone.'

He added on Twitter: 'To call the flight narrow would be an understatement.'

Production company Pelican Products made a video, which you can see below, of Corliss's preparations for the incredible stunt, in which he explains how he'll survive the feat.

This isnt' the first time Corliss has performed a wingsuit stunt in China. In 2011 he launched himself from a helicopter at 6,000ft and zoomed through the imposing Tianmen mountain in Hunan Province, China.

He was able to travelled for two-thirds of a mile - and through the 4,265ft mountain's natural archway - before releasing his parachute and descending gently to the ground. The arch measures less than 100ft across and left the daredevil with little margin for error.

Corliss was the first wingsuit stuntman to fly in China.
