Disgraced politician Eliot Spitzer sucked the toes of his topless mistress during a steamy hot tub session in front of young children, shocked witnesses have claimed.

The married ex-governor was allegedly spotted canoodling with Lis Smith, the former spokesman of newly-appointed New York mayor Bill de Blasio, near a family pool on holiday in Jamaica.

Guests were alerted when a 10-year-old boy reportedly ran back to his parents screaming: 'Mom, there's an old guy in the Jacuzzi with this girl and she's topless. He's sucking on her toes!'

Accusations: A spokeswoman for former governor Eliot Spitzer (left) has denied claims that he sucked the toes of his topless mistress Lis Smith (right) in the hot tub in front of children on holiday in Jamaica

Affair: Smith (second left) had worked as a spokeswoman during Spitzer's failed bid for New York comptroller in 2013 before their relationship became public

One witness told the New York Post that Smith 'would sit in his lap... then he'd put her feet in his mouth.' Another guest said 'it was gross'.

However, Mr Spitzer's spokesman, Lisa Linden, has denied the accounts, adding: 'These assertions are totally untrue.'

Friends of the pair also said claims were outrageous and wrong.

One told the New York Daily News: 'The couple both understand the scrutiny they’re under.

'That’s why they’re even more careful about their behavior. It makes [the rumor] even more ridiculous.'

Holiday: The alleged incident took place at the Half Moon family resort (above) in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where John and Jackie Kennedy stayed during his presidency

Happy: Lis Smith tweeted this message on the second day of their trip to Jamaica

 Half Moon family resort in Montego Bay, where John and Jackie Kennedy 
stayed during his presidency.

The couple checked out of the hotel on Sunday night after a five-day trip.

On the second day of the break, Mr Smith tweeted a picture of the resort with the message: 'Happy New Year. Here's to spending 2014 with the person (or ppl) you love.'

The witness accounts come days after it emerged that Ms Smith, 31, has not been asked to take up a position in Mr de Blasio’s new City Hall team in the wake of her affair with 54-year-old Mr Spitzer.

Bill de Blasio is sworn in as New York Mayor. Smith has not been asked to take up a position as his spokeswoman in the wake of her affair with 54-year-old Spitzer

Ms Smith had been a key spokesman during Mr de Blasio's campaign and transition until news of her relationship surfaced.

She hit the headlines last month after it emerged that she was in a relationship with ex-client Mr Spitzer, whom she’d previously worked for as a spokeswoman during his failed bid for New York comptroller in 2013.

Once their affair became headline news, Ms Smith was considered an unwelcome distraction by de Blasio’s team and she was effectively placed on leave.

On Christmas Day Ms Smith had taken Mr Spitzer to meet her parents at a party at their home in the Westchester village of Bronxville.

Just the day before, Mr Spitzer and his long-suffering wife Silda had announced the end of their marriage after photos had emerged of Mr Spitzer leaving his lover's Soho apartment.
