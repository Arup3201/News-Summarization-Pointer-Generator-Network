Veterans aren’t the only ones at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder - man’s best friend can suffer just as much as their human counterparts, experts say.

Veterinarians and service dog handlers at Lackland Air Force Base said that dogs - especially those who have been sent to Afghanistan and Iraq to keep U.S. troops safe - shut down after trauma.

They estimate that as many as 10 percent of dogs deployed overseas suffer from canine PTSD and need treatment for the condition, just like any human.

Cora, a Belgian Malinois who was used to sniff out bombs and other explosives in Iraq, was described by her trainers as a ‘very squared-away dog.’

She was trained to sniff out buried bombs in the terrain, then lie down once she detected an explosive.

Marine Staff Sgt Thomas Gehring, who handles Cora back at Lackland, said that her behavior began to change after a month of sniffing out bombs.

She hated being left alone, had become jumpy at loud noises, and would become excessively combative around other dogs.

‘Dogs experience combat just like humans,’ Sgt Gehring explained.

Though Cora looks healthy enough, and enjoys treats and belly scratches, her handlers have noticed her severe behavioral change.

They describe Cora’s case as a more mild instance of canine PTSD.

‘They’re essentially broken and can’t work,’ Lackland chief of behavioral medical and military working-dog studies, Walter Burghardt Jr. told the Los Angeles Times.

He added ‘This is something that does not get better without intervention.’

Burghardt added that because dogs cannot verbally express their anxieties, it is harder to treat.

The canines are treated much as a human PTSD sufferer would - with conditioning, training, and in some circumstances, medication.

The Times notes that dogs like Cora should be treated as a war hero and be allowed to live a life without stress, which would only aggravate her condition.

The dogs with more severe cases can often be taught to work in less demanding fields. If their PTSD is too great, they are given up for adoption and given to families.

As the Times reports, hundreds more service dogs have been utilized in the military since the September 11 terrorist attacks, with more than 2,500 dogs like Belgian Malinois and German shepherds patrolling.

Next month, the U.S. Working Dog Teams National Monument will be unveiled in Los Angeles to honor every dog who has served in combat since World War II.
