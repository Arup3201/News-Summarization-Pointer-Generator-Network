A crowd of thousands gathered yesterday for the memorial service of Melissa Jenkins, the teacher who went missing last weekend and was found murdered on Monday.

More than 2,000 people attended the memorial service at St.Johnsbury Academy, Vermont, the school where she taught, to remember the beloved teacher and single mother.

Allen and Patricia Prue were charged with her murder on Wednesday. The married couple allegedly lured Jenkins out of her home claiming their car had broken down before beating and strangling her to death. Jenkins' 2-year-old son was found unharmed in his mother's idling SUV the night she went missing.

'Extraordinary': Friends, family and former students paid tribute to Melissa Jenkins, who was found dead on Monday

The crowd of mourners wore pink, hundreds of pink balloons were put up and the whole community donned pink ribbons in tribute to the young mother who was described  as ‘extraordinary young woman’.

Earlier in the day, President Barack Obama sent his condolences to Jenkins’ family and friends during a campaign stop in Burlington.

Family, friends and Jenkins' former students remembered her warmth and expressed disbelief at her brutal murder.

‘The memory of her bright smile, her infectious personality and her warm heart will always be with us,' her cousin Eric Barry said.

'She was always just a bubbly person,' said former student Kimber Galdding. 'She would always be the one you could go to. You could talk to her about anything. It's just really a tragedy that this happened to such a great person.'

Students have written letters to Jenkins' two-year-old-son, Tyrell Javon 
Robertson, known as Ty, so he could eventually know how she had changed 
their lives, the school's headmaster Mr Lovett said.

Jenkins taught science and had served as the freshman girls basketball 
coach at the academy, a school of about 970 students.

'She just had such a good personality,' said former student Ashley Coburn. 'I don't know how anyone could do this.'

Victim: Students paid tribute to their former science teacher and have written letters to her 2-year-old son so he knows how much of a difference she made to them

Last weekend police began searching for the single mother when a friend found her unharmed two-year-old son abandoned in her idling SUV on a remote back road and raised the alarm.

She was found in the Connecticut River on Monday and Allen Prue, 30, and his wife Patricia Prue, 33, face 2nd degree murder charges and 
charges of improperly disposing of a body. They have pleaded not-guilty to the charges.

The couple allegedly called the 33-year-old mother out to help them on Sunday night before they strangled and beat her to death.

Having killed her, they allegedly doused her in bleach and dumped her naked body into the Connecticut river.

Allen Prue told police that he wanted to ‘get a girl’ on Sunday night and he had asked Jenkins out in the past, according to the court documents.

The only motive suggested in the court documents was that Allen Prue told police he wanted to 'get a girl' on Sunday night, although 'they didn't plan to get one forcefully.'

'They knew Miss Jenkins and had snow plowed her driveway a couple of years ago,' Vermont State Police Major Ed Ledo said.

Jenkins'
 former boyfriend told police she had told him she had gotten a call 
from a person who used to plow her driveway and she was going to help 
them, the documents say.

The ex-boyfriend told police Allen Prue had once asked Jenkins out on a date, and she felt uncomfortable around him.

Allen
 Prue later told police he and his wife were driving along the remote 
road when Patricia Prue called Jenkins and told her they had broken 
down.

Charged: Patricia Prue, 33, and her husband face charges of 2nd degree murder and of improperly disposing of a body

When 33-year-old 
Jenkins arrived to help, Allen Prue grabbed her and strangled her. They 
then put the body in the backseat of their car and drove to their home. 
At some point Patricia Prue strangled Jenkins as well, the documents 
said.

Back at their home, 
they put Jenkins' body on a tarp, removed all her clothes and poured 
bleach on her body. The Prues also removed their clothes and put them on
 the tarp.

They then drove 
to a boat access at the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from 
New Hampshire, and put Jenkins' body in the water, weighing it down with
 blocks and concealing it with brush.

They took the tarp and the clothes to New Hampshire where they burned it.

The
 Caledonian-Record reported that Allen Prue also worked for the 
newspaper as a deliveryman who turned up for work an hour late on the night of 
Jenkins’ death.

'Allen Prue 
completed his delivery route for the Caledonian Record on both Sunday 
and Monday nights. Route drivers reported, however, that the Prues 
arrived an hour late on Sunday night,' the newspaper said.

The accused couple pleaded not -guilty and were not granted bail.

Investigation: Vermont State Police investigate at Allen and Patricia Prue's home

Abandoned: Jenkins' two-year-old son was found inside the car with the engine running

Jenkins grew up in Danville, a tight-knit town west of St Johnsbury 
where she attended the Danville School, which has about 300 students.

'All the kids go through K-12 school together. They play basketball 
together. Most of them have worked at my store or here at The Creamery,'
 said Marty Beattie, Jenkins' uncle through his first wife, and the 
owner of Mary's Quick Stop a store on U.S. Route 2.

'They've laughed together, they've played together,' he said. 'So it's not all just genetic, but we're one big family.'
