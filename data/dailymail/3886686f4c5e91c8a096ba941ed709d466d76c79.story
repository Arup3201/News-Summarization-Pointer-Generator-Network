Tory peer Lord Ashcroft has tweeted a risqué picture of a naked woman - with only a bird protecting her modesty.

The image appeared on the 68-year-old's Twitter feed earlier today along with the caption, 'Those pesky pigeons...'.

The picture shows a woman sunbathing and lying on her front with what appears to be a seagull in the foreground facing the camera.

The picture sparked a number of responses, with some pointing out that the bird in the image was in fact a seagull rather than a pigeon.

Peter Rich wrote: '@LordAshcroft close examination shows it to be a seagull.'

When asked by another Twitter user whether his account had been hacked, he replied 'no...just lighthearted today...'.
