The track There Must Be More To Life Than This was recorded by Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury for the Queen album Hot Space in 1981

The song was eventually released as a solo effort by Mercury for his Mr Bad Guy album in 1985.

Now Queen’s guitarist Brian May, 67, and drummer Roger Taylor, 65, have announced it will feature on Queen Forever, a collection of the band’s love songs which will be released in November, together with two new Mercury tracks.

British music producer William Orbit said working on the material was like being handed ‘a trove of delights provided by the greatest of musicians’.

He said: ‘Hearing Michael Jackson’s vocals was stirring. So vivid, so cool, and poignant, it was like he was in the studio singing live.

‘With Freddie’s vocal solo on the mixing desk, my appreciation for his gift was taken to an even higher level.’

Mercury died in 1991 at the age of 45, while Jackson died in 2009 aged 50.
