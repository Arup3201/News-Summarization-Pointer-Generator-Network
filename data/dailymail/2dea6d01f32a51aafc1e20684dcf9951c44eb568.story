A jobseeker was shocked after he was branded as 'irritating', 'rude' and 'obnoxious' in a cutting email accidentally sent to him by a prospective employer.

James Allen was told he was an 'old, aesthetically challenged guy with no teeth' by the director of a window and conservatory firm, who sent the note after meeting with him about a job opening.

In the email, Sarah Haseler, from Right Price PVCu, also claimed Mr Allen was 'one of the most irritating, rude, obnoxious and arrogant people' she had ever had the 'misfortune' to meet.

Ms Haseler said the 'therapeutic rant' was sent by mistake and that she had written a second, more professionally-worded one that was intended for Mr Allen.

Mr Allen, a former serviceman, met with Ms Haseler for an informal conversation about an opening for a self-employed labourer at the company, based in Plymouth, Devon.

He claims he thought their initial meeting had gone well and that Ms Haseler had agreed to get in touch later that day.

When he heard nothing back, Mr Allen sent her an email saying: 'Just a quick email to say that you promised to phone me today.

'You did not. I rang your mobile but you did not answer. I sent a text you did not answer. When you promise something you carry it through.' 

He then received the e-mail, which contained several expletives.

One line in the message read: 'I only wish I'd have seen your CV beforehand, to save us both the time, as I would have probably noticed your main job role as professional p****.'  

The 48-year-old, from Princetown, Devon, said his confidence had been knocked by the personal attack.

He said: 'There's no way as a professional, and especially as a director of a company, that you would treat somebody that way. I really didn't expect something as nasty as that.' 

James,

Sincere apologies for not replying to you today, as it happens I actually have a job, and other things to do with my day other than reply to you, when I had already had the misfortune of wasting 30 very long minutes of my life speaking to; not only the most inappropriate person for this job role, but probably for any role, you will spend the next few years applying for, only to get rejected as soon as they meet you.

You are without doubt one of the most irritating, rude, obnoxious and arrogant people I have had the misfortune to meet, and your email just solidifies this.

Also, for an old aesthetically challenged guy with no teeth you have an unbelievable amount of confidence!

So you say, you didn't notice the word 'professional' on our website... belive me, if I had been anything other than 'professional', I would have told you what I was actually thinking which was 'this guy is an absolute ****, get the **** out'.

But no, alas, I stayed 'professional'. I only wish I'd have seen your CV beforehand, to save us both the time, as I would have probably noticed your main job role as 'professional p****'.

Good luck for the future

Sarah

Ms Haseler admitted she had sent the wrong email, but defended its message, saying she had been left 'genuinely shocked' by Mr Allen's behaviour, claiming he was 'belittling and offensive'. 

She said: 'Ironically, I had read something that day which said if you are angry or upset you should write it down and get it all out to move on.

'So that evening at home I did this. I then wrote another email reply to James.

'Unfortunately, I now realise that it was in fact the other email which was sent in error, which was never supposed to be seen by him. 

'I must stress this was my personal opinion, and not the opinion of the company, and the email written, although sent in error, was in retaliation to a person insulting me.'

Ms Haseler claims the meeting with James was not an official interview as they were looking for a self-employed labourer to help carry out basic tasks such as carrying materials and dig holes.

She added: 'James was so unbelievably rude, inappropriate and insulting, towards me personally and also the company.

'I actually thought it was a joke. I was waiting for the hidden camera crew to jump out and say "ha, got ya".

'I was genuinely shocked, hurt and angered by his behaviour and attitude, and the things he said.

'We have worked very hard to build this family business up and when someone is insulting the business it does feel like they are hurting a member of your family.

'He was derogatory, belittling and offensive and I felt extremely uncomfortable the entire time he was there. When he left I politely said 'Thanks, I'll give you a ring to let you know'.

'That evening, a few hours later on the same day he came in, he sent an email, which was also rude, insulting and harassing.

'James had therefore rejected the self-employed role in this email, so he was not looking for feedback. He said he was not interested.'
