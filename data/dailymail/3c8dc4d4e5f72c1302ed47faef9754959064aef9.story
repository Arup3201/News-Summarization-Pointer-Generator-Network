It may have been five years since the Pussycat Dolls went their separate ways, but with rumours of a reunion sparked by Nicole Scherzinger, it seems they're still as cool as when they burst onto the scene with Don't Cha back in 2003.

While lead singer Nicole may have had the most solo success since leaving, Kimberly Wyatt has worked as a DJ and a judge on Sky1's Got to Dance since her pop star days.

Clearly not content, she's now following in her former bandmate's footsteps by designing her own fashion range, too.

Kimberly, 32, has designed and modelled a new range of jumpsuits for Dancing Leopard, which, she says, are designed to flatter all figures with 'beautiful bohemian, feminine silhouettes'.

Singer turned designer: Kimberly Wyatt shot to fame as one sixth of Pussycat Dolls and her career is still going strong. Her latest project? Designing a range of jumpsuits and dresses for Dancing Leopard

The collection has apparently been designed with careful consideration of design, colours and fabrics - all of which have been chosen by Kimberly to reflect her taste and style. The designs can be dressed up or down, and, she says, are the epitome of transitional summer style.

Speaking about the collaboration, she said: 'I am a big fan of Dancing Leopard and was delighted to design a seven piece range for them - I have hand-picked all the fabrics and colours and am really pleased with the designs.

'The £44.50  jumpsuits are perfect for the coolest daytime festival or beach look and can be dressed up with heels for the evening for effortless glamour. I love the movement that these outfits allow, the fabrics are so cool and don’t restrict your body.

'They complement the female figure, especially the one size fits all genie jumpsuits.'

Dancing Leopard, which aims to create ideal designs for women who want freedom, functionality and fashion, are thrilled to have Kimberly on board.

'The Dancing Leopard team is so excited to be collaborating with Kimberly, we instantly loved the concept of her collection and it's been a really fun project for us.  

'Kimberly has a down to earth nature and a great sense of style and we feel that the beautiful movements philosophy fits with our brand perfectly,' they said.

The new range may come in handy after the star discovered she was pregnant while on honeymoon with husband Max Rogers, also 32, in New York in April. Their baby girl, is due in December.

Clearly the snaps were taken before conceiving and Kimberly showcases her athletic figure that she'll no doubt regain after her pregnancy.

The sporty star recently revealed that being a member of the Pussycat Dolls ignited her passion for fitness.

She told Health & Fitness magazine: 'There was a lot of pressure from the management label to stay in shape. I knew we were replaceable, so the pressure of wanting to stay in the group kept me in the gym.'

The Dolls would usually have a group gym session before starting dance practice and she and close friend and fellow bandmate Ashley Roberts would do circuit training together as well.

The 32-year-old does, however, admit that it's harder to stay in shape these days explaining that she's had to find a routine that fits her busy schedule.

Kimberly works out three to five times a week, incorporating hot yoga three times a week for an hour and a half, as well as dance and circuit training.

When she's over in Los Angeles, she loves to play volleyball outside and says she really enjoyed trying the winter sports she was challenged to on the TV show The Jump.

'Exercise absolutely has to work with my life and be something I can live with,' she said.

'It's a priority because it's a source of stress relief and fuels my determination. It's all about keeping my workouts mixed and having something to look forward to.'

As well as working on her toned physique, Kimberly has been focussing on her DJing and has been working with Maxinutrition, promoting the fit and healthy lifestyle that she loves.

She has also been filming for the next series of TV show Got To Dance, which airs in August, and her make-up company, Beautiful Movement Cosmetics, will be going into Holland & Barrett stores.
