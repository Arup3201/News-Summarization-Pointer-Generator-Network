Children in state primary and secondary schools could be trained in meditation to help them cope with stress.

Ministers are considering  introducing lessons in ‘mindfulness’ – a growing movement  based on ancient Eastern traditions of meditation.

Schools Minister David Laws  said evidence suggested the sessions could help boost pupils’ attitudes  and motivation.

Teaching children how to meditate and breathing techniques can help them cope with stress and pay attention, it is claimed

He said the Government was ‘very interested’ in promoting mindfulness, which teaches participants to relate directly to whatever is happening ‘in the moment’.

The revelation follows calls from a leading public school headmaster for schools to set aside time for quiet reflection every day.

Anthony Seldon said a ‘daily stillness period’ would help improve children’s concentration and reduce levels of anxiety and depression. He has championed the practice at his school, Wellington College, in Berkshire.

Now ministers have disclosed  they believe mindfulness techniques ‘certainly merit consideration’ and education minister Liz Truss has  been actively looking into the practice, it emerged.

Giving evidence at the Commons education select committee yesterday, Liberal Democrat Mr Laws was asked whether the Department  for Education planned to promote mindfulness courses to boost children’s wellbeing.

In reply, he said: ‘We are very 
interested in promoting this and we certainly think that it’s an area 
that merits consideration based on the evidence we’ve seen to date. My 
colleague Liz Truss actually has been looking at this recently.’

Asked
 to explain the concept of mindfulness, he said: ‘It’s about trying to 
impact on people’s motivations, their attitudes to life. It’s about 
trying to get at some of the things we don’t always get at through our 
crude technical interventions.

Education Minister David Laws said said he thought in 'mindfulness' should be taken seriously in helping to improve pupils' 'attitudes to life'

‘It’s an area that we should take seriously while making sure that there is proper evidence-based scrutiny of it.’ Rooted in ancient Buddhist practices, the modern mindfulness movement has been gathering momentum over the last 30 years.

Advocating the practice, Dr Seldon said the decline of religious assemblies had reduced opportunities for pupils to ‘reflect during the school day’, just as large numbers of children faced unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety.

Pupils’ concentration had also been eroded by the ‘incessant chatter’ of modern life, he said, with children spending a large amount of time on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

Wellington College has a mindfulness programme that involves two-minute ‘stillness’ periods each day. Pupils aged between 13 and 15 have a further 15-minute session each week.

Dr Seldon added:  ‘Mindfulness or meditation has been shown to be an invaluable tool to help bolster  young people’s resilience to psychological stress. It also boosts concentration, depth of thought, happiness and achievement.

‘It is the most simple and natural technique to learn … It is all about being yourself, making the most of yourself, and making the most of the opportunities that life presents to you. It promotes trusting relationships, healthy living and psychological and emotional security.’

He said schools had a duty to give pupils time to think, free of daily work, mobile telephones and the internet.

Dr Seldon has previously pioneered wellbeing lessons, because he had seen during his time as a teacher ‘far too many tortured and unhappy pupils who have achieved four or five A grades at A-level’.

Schools should teach such life  skills, he added, ‘while individuals are still having their characters and habits formed’.

Inspired by ancient Buddhist meditation, mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by US doctors to combat stress.

The therapies aim to help people live more ‘in the moment’ and spend less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems.

Techniques include moving  the focus of attention around  the body and observing sensations that arise – the so-called ‘body scan’.

Others involve concentrating on breathing or completing yoga-style movements and observing sensations in moments of movement and stillness.

Mindfulness is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures around them.

Although some regard it with scepticism, studies appear to show a clinical benefit for treating a range of mental health problems.

Thousands of mindfulness sessions are prescribed to NHS patients every year to help treat anxiety and depression.

Celebrity adherents of the now secular practice include Hollywood actresses Goldie Hawn and Meg Ryan.
