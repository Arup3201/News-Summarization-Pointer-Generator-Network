Twitter has launched a major new alerts service to allow the emergency services to tweet information in times of attack or crisis.

Police forces across the UK, the Foreign Office and the Environment Agency have all signed up to the scheme.

The new alerts, which launched in the U.S. earlier this year and have already been used in emergency situations such as the Capitol Hill shooting, send tweets with a special orange ‘alert’ bell.

users who sign up for an account’s Twitter Alerts will receive a 
notification directly to their phone via text message.

If you sign up to receive an account’s 
Twitter Alerts, you will receive a notification directly to your phone 
whenever that account marks a Tweet as an alert.

Alerts will be indicated with an orange bell in the bottom left-hand corner.

To subscribe to these notifications, you can go directly to an account’s setup page at twitter.com/[username]/alerts.

Additionally, on the web, users can see if an organisation is part of the program by visit its Twitter profile.

It is hoped the alerts could help during
terror attacks or other major events, and 57 organisations in the UK 
and Ireland will be part of the initiative.

'All of the organisations participating in today’s launch already use Twitter as a tool to communicate important information to their followers,' a spokesman for Twitter said. 

'The added functionality of Twitter Alerts will help them reach their followers with important and accurate information during emergencies, natural disasters or when other communications services aren’t accessible.

'Digital communications is enhancing the way we share warning information during an incident,' added John Curtin, head of incident management at the Environment Agency. 

'We know from our users how important it is to be able to receive reliable information during times of crisis,' Twitter continued.

In London, the Metropolitan Police, London Fire Brigade, and the Mayor of London’s office have all signed up to use the system.

'Getting fast and accurate information to the public in a major incident or terrorist attack really could make a life-saving difference,' said Commander David Martin, head of  emergency planning for the Metropolitan Police Service.

'Using social networking sites, including Twitter, gives us additional ways to talk directly to the public.  Twitter Alerts means that our messages will stand out when it most matters.'

The Fire Brigade hopes the new service will help address one of the major problems Twitter has faced during major crises - false information being spread online.

Even Twitter admits to the problem, saying: 'Unfortunately, as with any place where people talk, Twitter has its share of rumors. For the most part these are spread by people who are well-intentioned but misinformed. Regardless, in a crisis rumors can lead to panic.'

Rita Dexter, Deputy Commissioner for the London Fire Brigade, said: 'People act on information shared on social media. During a major incident accurate, verified and frequent updates are essential.'
