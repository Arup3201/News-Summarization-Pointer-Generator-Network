Taxing man: Quarry Bank School reports scolded John Lennon, centre, for 'fighting', 'shoving' and having 'no interest whatsoever'. This image of him in 1957 was itself auctioned in 2009

His rebellious nature would one day help to change modern music.

So it is unsurprising that John Lennon was not the most well-behaved schoolboy.

Detention sheets from when the Beatles legend was 14 and 15 revealed that he was punished for ‘fighting in the classroom’, being a ‘nuisance’, ‘shoving’ and showing ‘just no interest whatsoever’.

On two occasions he even managed to receive three detentions in one day, for behaviour including ‘silliness’ and ‘chewing’. Another time, he gave an ‘impudent answer to question’.

The documents, which are estimated to fetch between £2,000 and £3,000 at  auction, uncover Lennon’s antics at Quarry Bank High School for Boys, in Liverpool, where he was renowned as a ‘class clown’.

The sheets cover the periods when he was in Class 3B in May and June 1955, and in Class 4C from November 1955 to February 1956.

They were discovered in the late 1970s when a member of staff at the grammar school was asked to clear out a storage room and burn all of the books inside.

Fortunately, while burning several books, he spotted the name ‘Lennon’ at the top of some of the pages and realised who they related to.

A staff member saw 'Lennon' at the top of the sheets and tore them out, burning the rest of the book

According to auctioneers  TracksAuction.com, he tore the sheets out and kept them as a keepsake. They have been authenticated by Lennon’s close school friend, Pete Shotton, who wrote a book John Lennon: In My Life.

Peter Beech, Lennon’s general science teacher at the time, said: ‘The sheet is typical of John Lennon, he was an extremely cheeky boy. He did, however, know his  limits. In the classroom, if you  settled John down, you generally settled the class down.’

Mr Beech added: ‘His chemistry teacher, Eric Oldman, said that John could actually go far.’

The singer, who was murdered in 1980, said of his rebellious teenage years: ‘I was the one who all the other boys’ parents would say, “Keep away from him”.

‘The parents instinctively recognised I was a troublemaker.’

Online bidding at TracksAuction.com starts on November 22 and the auction concludes with a live online sale beginning at 5pm on December 1. Other items in the Beatles memorabilia sale are a signed White Album, expected to fetch between £60,000 and £80,000, handwritten lyrics to an  unpublished 60s song by Sir Paul McCartney and an unpublished Lennon sketch.
