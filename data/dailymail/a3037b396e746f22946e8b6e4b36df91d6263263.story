Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel: She agreed if Greece left the euro it wouldn't have a great impact on the remaining countries

Greece was warned last night it has one ‘last chance’ to avoid bankruptcy as allies of Angela Merkel made clear she does not care if the country drops out of the euro.

The ultimatum was delivered by eurozone boss Jean-Claude Juncker as a week of crunch talks over the fate of the single currency started.

The hard line from Germany came as Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras put out the begging bowl again.

He is demanding two more years to bring in austerity measures which were agreed in exchange for two multi-billion pound bailouts from Brussels.

But that will mean the cuts will not be in place until 2016, rather than the agreed deadline of 2014, leaving Greece needing more money.

A clear warning that the Greeks cannot expect more cash from Europe’s richest nation came from Dr Michael Fuchs, deputy chairman of Mrs Merkel’s CDU party.

He said a Greek exit from the single  currency would not have a ‘great impact’ because it is widely expected.

Mr Samaras held talks with Mr Juncker in Athens, pledging to do what is necessary to tackle his country’s debts.

Mr Juncker, leader of the eurozone finance ministers’ group, praised ‘tremendous efforts’ to cut the deficit but said ‘priority number one’ was to  get Greece’s public finances in order.

‘The ball is in the Greek court – in fact this is the last chance and Greek citizens have to know this,’ he said.

Earlier Mr Samaras launched a charm offensive with the German press.

In an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, he warned Greece will be on the verge of collapse unless it gets the next tranche of the agreed bailout in October. ‘If we don’t, Greece is broke,’ he said.

However, Mr Samaras also pledged: ‘The Germans will get their money back. I am guaranteeing that personally. We will fulfil our obligations fully.’

He told the tabloid Bild: ‘All we want is a bit of “air to breathe” to get the economy running and to increase state income. More time does not automatically mean more money.’

But Dr Fuchs made it clear that German patience is wearing thin. He warned: ‘I don’t believe there is a chance for a third bailout because our voters are not really too happy with it.

‘We gave them already much more time than was originally planned.’

He argued the departure of Greece from the eurozone would not have a ‘great impact’ on the remaining nations, and suggested Mrs Merkel held similar views.

‘If Greece is going to leave, I don’t think it’s going to have a very great impact anymore, because the countries are prepared.

‘There is enough money available to ring-fence these countries and make sure there is no domino effect.’

Asked if that was also Mrs Merkel’s view, he said: ‘I believe so, yes.’

Last night David Cameron held phone conversations with French President Francois Hollande and US President Barack Obama, partly about the eurozone.

The Prime Minister is keen to see the latest crisis resolved because of Treasury fears a Greek exit will hit Spain and Italy.

Mr Samaras goes to Berlin on Friday to meet Mrs Merkel and to Paris a day later for talks with Mr Hollande.
