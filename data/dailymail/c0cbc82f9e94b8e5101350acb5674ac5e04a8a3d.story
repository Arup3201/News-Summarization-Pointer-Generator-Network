The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tried to fly home from their Royal Tour Down Under incognito by using the aliases Mr and Mrs Jones.

The royal couple even named Prince George Baby Jones as they attempted a low-key departure from Australia on Qantas after the three-week trip.

However, their cover was blown this time
 around when they booked the entire first-class section of the Qantas 
jet at Sydney airport - and tried to check in 90 bags.

The luggage was heavier than when they arrived in New Zealand thanks to all the presents that had been given to Prince George throughout the trip.

And it's not the first time Prince William and Kate have tried to slip under the radar by using a common British name.

In 2009, they used the pseudonym Mr and Mrs Smith when booking into a holiday home in Cornwall for William's 27th birthday.

A source told The Sun: 'It was funny that they used such common British names. Even Prince George was Baby Jones.

'But it did seem a bit daft as everyone knew it was them.'

The royals are not the only high-profile people to travel using a fake name.

When checking into a hotel, singer Fergie reportedly uses the famous Beatles song title Penny Lane, while Kate Beckinsale does a play on words with Sigourney Beaver, and Lyndsay Lohan goes by Bella Lovelace.

Other stars have been known to use Disney characters with Kim Kardashian choosing Princess Jasmine, and Paris Hilton checking in as Tinkerbell.
