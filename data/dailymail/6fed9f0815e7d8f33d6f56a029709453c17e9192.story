Drunken driver: Thomas Cypress, 58, was ordered to pay a total of $35million in restitution stemming from the 2009 DUI crash that killed a retired couple in Florida

The family of an elderly Maryland couple who were killed in 2009 when a drunken driver slammed into their vehicle have been awarded a total of $35million in damages by a civil court in Florida.

Thomas Cypress, the driver of the truck that plowed into the car of Robert and Paulette Kirkpatrick on Tamiami Trail, killing them both, was ordered Monday to pay $5million in punitive damages in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the victims’ children.

The decision came just days after a jury decided that Cypress, 58, should pay $30million in compensatory damages to the Kirkpatrick family.

‘I think the jury honored our parents by sending a message to our community that drinking and driving is not something it is going to stand for,’ Steven Kirkpatrick, the couple’s eldest son, told the Miami Herald.

Mr Cypress, a former airboat driver, is currently serving 12 years in prison after being convicted in 2010 of two DUI manslaughter counts stemming from the deadly February 2009 crash.

The Kirkpatricks, both 63 years old, arrived in Florida to attend an art show in Naples and enjoy a winter vacation. The couple had retired from teaching just a few years earlier.

On February 19, Robert and Paulette were riding in a rented car along Tamiami Trail in Miami-Dade County when Thomas Cypress, the brother of a former Miccosukee tribal chairman, veered his truck the wrong way and smashed head on into the sedan.

At the time of the collision, Cypress' blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit, and he was driving on a suspended license after an earlier DUI charge.

Prior to the 2009 crash, Mr Cypress had been arrested for drunken driving on two separate occasions.

During a two-day civil trial last week, a jury heard from Jennifer and Steven Kirkpatrick, the victims' children, before awarding them $30million in compensatory damages following a 15-minute deliberation.

On Monday, the same jurors deliberated for two hours before reaching a decision to award additional $5million in punitive damages.

Cypress' attorney William Fink told jurors his client is destitute and has no means to pay the family restitution.

But the lawyer hired to represent the plaintiffs insisted that the defendant has the funds to pay the damages based on the fact that he retained the services of a well-known private law firm, CBS Miami reported.

The Kirkpatricks said in court that the tragic loss of their parents robbed them of countless memories, including weddings and births of grandchildren that the victims will never get to meet, the station WSVN reported.

Steven Kirkpatrick said that he hopes the high damages awarded in their case will help discourage other people from getting behind the wheel drunk and prevent such tragedies from happening.
