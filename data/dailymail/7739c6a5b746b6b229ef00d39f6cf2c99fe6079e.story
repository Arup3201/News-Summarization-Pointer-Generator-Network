LIFE OF A CHALK STREAM by Simon Cooper, (Collins £16.99)

As the poet pondered: ‘What is this life if full of care/We have no time to stand and stare . . .’ What indeed? So hats off to conservationist Simon Cooper who stands and stares for much of his working life, frequently up to his bits in bogs and marshes, as he marvels at the beauty abounding in England’s chalkstreams.

Cooper stares at the world of wetlands and swamps through the rose-tinted specs of a passionate Nature lover.

Simon Cooper writes about the joys of fishing, surrounded by Nature in the great British countryside

That irritating cloud of pesky midges hovering over the water that you or I swat away appear to Cooper as one of the world’s wonders. For him each midge is a creature of beauty with its impressive mandible and translucent veined wings. Those tussock clump thingies along the river bank that sprout thin razor-sharp blades that cut your ankles to shreds are, for Cooper, precious refuges for insects and tiny mammals. Shake a tussock and more than 60 species fall out.

Chalkstreams, found mostly in Southern England, are unique.

They flow through chalk land, their water springing from natural reservoirs thousands of feet below ground. Cooper is a leading chalkstream conservationist and much of his book describes such daunting chores such as scything, unblocking, replanting, de-clogging, grave-refreshing, oxygen checking and so forth.

Flowers and otters are two of many sources of inspiration for author and nature-lover Simon Cooper

And talk about hazardous! Stinging wasps, hissing swans, tussocks ripping his hands, nasty chest-high nettles... Cooper braves them all. He describes rescuing an angry bat — bats carry the rabies virus, remember — from a fishing hook.

The bat opens its snarling mouth, exposing a vicious jaw full of sharp incisors, and Cooper grasps the hook with forceps and deftly twists it out in one move.

Then there’s the oozing mud problem. Cooper has learnt that the worst thing to do when crossing a boggy bit is to adopt a bold stride. Do that and you’ll fall face down into the slime. His tip is to shuffle forward until reaching ‘firm bottom’ (Oh, give me firm bottom any day of the week . . .)

Simon Cooper enjoys fishing despite the pesky midges that hover over the water

Speaking of oozing mud, each step Cooper takes releases a terrible pong — part methane, part rotting vegetation. All that river-bank Nature, fermenting and decaying, is exceedingly whiffy, as are the hawthorn hedges which ‘emit the most awful stench like rotting corpses’.

The bane of chalkstream restorers are the invaders. There’s the dread Himalayan Balsam plant, whose rampant growth kills all native plants. He yanks it up by the root.

Another invader, the American mink, arrived in 1930 having escaped from fur farms. This furry killing-machine is wiping out all our dear little mice, voles and moorhens.

Cooper sees magic in every river crawler, creeper, clinger and digger.

As for eels, who knew that they make a weird slurping sound as they Hoover up insects?

Herons, otters, the mating rituals of sticklebacks, the Mayfly dance, the spawning habits of salmon, the skills of angling are all, for Cooper, a source of inspiration and wonder.

Nature might be red in tooth and claw and occasionally whiffy but Cooper’s enthusiasm is so infectious that by the time you finish his book you have put tussock-shaking, hawthorn fly-stroking and eel-spotting at the very top of your Bucket List.
