The husband of Ruby Wax's late sister-in-law has reached a ‘compromise deal’ with Network Rail over a High Court Action he brought over her death at a level crossing.

Mother-of-three Julia Canning, 55, died at a public crossing at Fairfield, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, in May 2009.

She was struck by an express train as she took her pet dogs Tigger and Jazz over the railway line.

Now Chartered surveyor The Honourable Spencer Canning, 61, yesterday revealed he has settled ‘out of court’ after a bitter two year battle for compensation.

He refused to say how much money he got - but said ‘it was considerably less’ than a £600,000 claim he entered.

'It is over. I have closed the book on that episode of my life.

'There was a compromise to be reached and that was finally agreed. Both sides have agreed.

'From our side we have had enough. We had been trying to get satisfaction out of them (Network Rail) for two years.'

 Rail was fined £356,250 with £19,485 costs at Southampton 
Crown Court for breaches of the health and safety law which led to her 
death after a prosecution by the Office of Rail Regulation.

In June 2010 a verdict of accidental death was recorded at her inquest. Network Rail confirmed it had come to an ‘out of court settlement’ with him.

But in a savage aside at Network Rail Mr Canning said: 'They were so combative through the whole process.’

'It
 felt on many occasions we were the guilty party not they. I have had to
 produce over 80 documents detailing the complete finances of myself and
 Julia and the family circumstances.

'I felt like a criminal -they have been obstructive right the way through the process. There is no recognition on behalf of Network Rail as to the devastation that follows this type of horrendous event.

He is so furious at his treatment that he is contacting his MP Claire Perry - who is also the RAIL MINISTER - to see if there is anything he can do to help other people who are victims of similar events.

'For many other victims the attitude of Network Rail remains a disgrace.'

He has moved from his house at Little Bedwyn where he lived for 22 years following the loss of his wife’s income which was essential to the upkeep of the home

 He has also hardly worked because of the trauma of the Accident - but now FIVE years later he is at last getting back to working again.

He now has another much cheaper house in Burbage.
