A small plane crash into a North Texas home left at least two people seriously injured.

FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford says a Beechcraft B35 aircraft smashed the house's roof Sunday afternoon, and then landed in the yard of a home in Gordonville, about 85 miles north of Dallas.

Trooper Mark Tackett of the Texas Department of Public Safety said the engine and propeller came off the plane, which struck another home before the plane landed in a backyard.

Lunsford says two adults and two children were injured.

One woman passenger was flown to hospital and another man was seriously injured after a Beechcraft B35 crashed into a backyard in Gordonville, Texas, near the border with Oklahoma. 

The family who live where the plane crash ended began rescuing the passengers from the flaming debris.

'I looked out the window as it hit right there in my backyard,' Rhonda Brogdon told KXII.

John Bratron, a relative of the homeowners, said that fuel was all over the plane and he feared that fire from the home that was hit could have reached the aircraft or nearby propane tanks.

He said that he thought the pilot was dead when he saw him hanging out of the side of the plane. 

The family helped tackle the fire at their neighbor's home after taking the passengers out of the plane. 

No one was inside the home that caught fire.

Tackett said the pilot and one passenger had serious injuries and the other two people were not seriously hurt.  

One of seriously injured, a woman, was flown to the Medical Center of Plano. 

No bystanders were injured. 

The plane had taken off around 12.30pm from Tyler, Texas and was heading to Cedar Mills Airport, near the Gordonville, shortly before crashing.

The aircraft was registered to Robert Gentry of Tyler, according to the Tyler Morning Telegraph.

It is not yet known what caused the crash.
