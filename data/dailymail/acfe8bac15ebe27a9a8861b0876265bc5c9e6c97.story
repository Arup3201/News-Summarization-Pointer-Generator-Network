Broadcasters are trained to keep a cool head in the case of any unscheduled interruptions.

Footage of the broadcast shows the little girl trying to hand her mother a smartphone, before sheepishly backing away after realising she is on the air.

The consummate professional maintained her composure throughout, the only signs that she'd even noticed the interruption a faintly raised eyebrow and a barely perceptible shake of the head.
