A dedicated dog owner had to be rescued from a muddy bog after he dived into a harbour to try and rescue his blind animal who had walked off the end of a pier. 

Simon O'Brien found himself stuck in thick silt and mud after he jumped in at Whitstable Harbour in Kent. 

His beloved pet Skippy, a 12-year-old border collie who is half blind, had accidentally walked off the harbour edge and plummeted 20ft into the thick mud.

Mr O'Brien climbed down a ladder and dived into the mud to save Skippy. He managed to get the dog onto the stern of a moored fishing boat but then realised he needed help himself.

Police officers helped pull him free from the harbour. 

The Coastguard Rescue Team then hoisted Skippy, who was caked in mud and silt, to safety. 

Tim Judge, a member of the rescue team, climbed down onto the boat before placing the dog in a bag and hauling him back to the top of the quay.

Skippy was covered in mud and was later tested for hypothermia but was found to be in good health 

Neither of the pair were injured or suffering from hypothermia after the incident.  

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency Spokesperson said: 'We're pleased that Skippy is now back safe with his owner and that this has a happy ending.

'We would like to remind the public not to attempt a rescue unless trained and equipped to do so to avoid getting in trouble yourself.'
