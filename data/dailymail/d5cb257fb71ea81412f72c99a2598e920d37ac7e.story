Glaciers in the Himalayas: The new survey, using data from Nasa satellites reveals that Himalayan glaciers are melting far more slowly than predicted

Himalayan glaciers are melting far more slowly than predicted, according to a new satellite study from the University of Colorado Boulder.

Previous estimates of 
ice loss in the high Asia mountains have ranged up to 50 billion tons a year, said the university's Professor John Wahr.

The actual figure is a mere four billion tonnes, according to a survey using data from Nasa satellites.

Previously, it had been claimed that Himalayan glaciers would have melted to a fifth of current levels by 2035, leading to sea level rises and drought.

Those predictions used ground-based measurements, whereas the new study measured the effect of gravity on twin Nasa satellites to give an accurate measure of the mass of ice being lost.

‘The results in this region really
 were a surprise,’ said Wahr.

‘One possible explanation is that previous
 estimates were based on measurements taken primarily from some of the 
lower, more accessible glaciers in Asia and were extrapolated to infer 
the behavior of higher glaciers.'

'But unlike the lower glaciers, many of 
the high glaciers would still be too cold to lose mass, even in the 
presence of atmospheric warming.’

‘What is still not clear is how these 
rates of melt may increase and how rapidly glaciers may shrink in the 
coming decades,’ said Professor Pfeffer. ‘That makes it 
hard to project into the future.’

Around the world, melting has been overestimated. Earth's glaciers and ice caps are 
shedding roughly 150 billion tons of ice annually - up to 30 per cent lower 
than predicted.

'It had been suggested by hard-green campaigners, and regrettably endorsed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the Himalayan glaciers might disappear by the year 2035, leading to imminent drought and starvation for billions, a claim since widely rubbished,' says Lewis Page of science site The Register.

'The new GRACE readings would seem to be further confirmation of that prediction's foolishness.'

The research effort is the first comprehensive satellite study of the contribution of the world's melting glaciers and ice caps to global sea level rise

Overall, it indicates that melting adding roughly 0.4 millimeters annually, said CU-Boulder physics Professor John Wahr, who helped lead the study.

The researchers used satellite 
measurements taken with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or 
GRACE,, to calculate that the world's
 glaciers and ice caps had lost about 148 billion tons, or about 39 
cubic miles of ice annually from 2003 to 2010.

Traditional estimates of Earth's ice 
caps and glaciers have been made using ground-based measurements from 
relatively few glaciers to infer what all of the unmonitored glaciers 
around the world were doing, he said.

Only a few hundred of the roughly 200,000 glaciers worldwide have been monitored for a decade or more.

‘The strength of GRACE is that it 
sees everything in the system,’ said Wahr. ‘Even though we don't have 
the resolution to look at individual glaciers, GRACE has proven to be an
 exceptional tool.’

The total does not count 
the mass from individual glacier and ice caps on the fringes of the 
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets -- roughly an additional 80 billion 
tons.

Nasa's twin Grace satellites measured ice loss far more accurately than previous studies, which used ground-based estimates

‘This is the first time anyone has 
looked at all of the mass loss from all of Earth's glaciers and ice caps
 with GRACE,’ said Wahr.

‘The Earth is losing an incredible amount of 
ice to the oceans annually, and these new results will help us answer 
important questions in terms of both sea rise and how the planet's cold 
regions are responding to global change.’

A paper on the subject is being published in the Feb. 9 online edition of the journal Nature.

Launched in 2002, two GRACE satellites whip around Earth in tandem 16 times a day at an altitude of about 300 miles, sensing subtle variations in Earth's mass and gravitational pull.

Separated by roughly 135 miles, the satellites measure changes in Earth's gravity field caused by regional changes in the planet's mass, including ice sheets, oceans and water stored in the soil and in underground aquifers.

A positive change in gravity during a satellite approach over Greenland, for example, tugs the lead GRACE satellite away from the trailing satellite, speeding it up and increasing the distance between the two.

A sensitive ranging system allows researchers to measure the distance of the two satellites down to as small as 1 micron- about 1/100 the width of a human hair - and to calculate ice and water amounts from particular regions of interest around the globe using their gravity fields. 

‘The total amount of ice lost to Earth's oceans from 2003 to 2010 would cover the entire United States in about 1 and one-half feet of water,’ said Wahr, also a fellow at the CU-headquartered Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences.

According to the GRACE data, total sea level rise from all land-based ice on Earth including Greenland and Antarctica was roughly 1.5 millimeters per year annually or about 12 millimeters, or one-half inch, from 2003 to 2010, said Wahr.

The sea rise amount does include the expansion of water due to warming, which is the second key sea-rise component and is roughly equal to melt totals, he said.

‘One big question is how sea level rise is going to change in this century,’ said Pfeffer. ‘If we could understand the physics more completely and perfect numerical models to simulate all of the processes controlling sea level -- especially glacier and ice sheet changes -- we would have a much better means to make predictions. But we are not quite there yet.’
