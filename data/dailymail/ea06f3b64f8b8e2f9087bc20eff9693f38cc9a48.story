Friday morning marks a special milestone for media personality and Gold Logie winner Karl Stefanovic, who celebrates a decade on the Today show since it began in 2005.

Co-host Lisa Wilkinson congratulated her 'TV husband' on Nine Network's breakfast show, saying she 'can't imagine doing this with anybody else'. Awww...

And the figures speak for themselves.

After doing the sums, Wilkinson concluded that her co-host had clocked up over 8,000 hours on breakfast television.

'That officially makes you the most watched person on Australian TV ever,' she said.

Stefanovic has had some infamous moments on the breakfast show, including the time he was intoxicated while hosting the post-Logies show in 2009.

Wilkinson said her time on the show with Stefanovic as 'been a complete joy'.

'Ten years is a very special anniversary to mark,' Wilkinson said on the show this morning.

'I've only spent eight of those years with you, but you are my TV husband, you know how much I love you.

The show looked back at some of Stefanovic's memorable moments including the 2009 post-Logies show when he still appeared drunk from the night before.

'The Logies will always have a special place in my heart,' Wilkinson said.

'Australia realised that, you know, he's about as real an Aussie bloke as you could possibly find.'

Richard Wilkins says Stefanovic has changed over the 10 years he's been on the show but is 'still the scallywag he's always been on the inside'. 

'He's an intoxicating mix of world's best broadcaster and naughty school boy,' Wilkins said.

The presenter also tried to tell the Dalai Lama a pizza joke in 2011

The 40-year-old is also notorious for his cringeworthy meeting with the Dalai Lama, where he tried to tell the pizza a joke but failed to impressed the spiritual leader.

'The Dalai Lama walks into a pizza shop,' Stefanovic said in 2011.

'And he says, "Can you make me one with everything?"'

After an uncomfortable silence, Stefanovic acknowledges: 'Oh, I knew it wouldn't work.'

Stefanovic paid tribute to his team, past and present, for 'making the 10 years fly by'.

'We started with Tracy [Grimshaw] 10 years ago - it feels like yesterday,' he said.

'Thanks guys and I look forward to the next ten... Do I? I really don't mean what I say,' he joked.

On a more serious note, the presenter further thanked the viewers of the show.

'Most importantly to everyone at home watching us, for being understanding of my weird personality quirks,' he said.
