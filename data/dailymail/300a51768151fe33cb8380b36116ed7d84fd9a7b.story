Roy Keane has slammed Sir Alex Ferguson for his dispute with John Magnier over the horse Rock of Gibraltar.

The legendary Manchester United boss was embroiled in a legal battle over the ownership of the champion racehorse with Magnier - who was part of the Cubic Expression investment group, United's biggest shareholders until the takeover by the Glazer family.

Now Keane, in his new autobiography Second Half, has criticised his former manager for his role in the scandal.

'He [Ferguson] was just a mascot for them - "look at me, how big I am" - and he didn't even own the bloody thing,' wrote Keane.

Ferguson and Magnier settled out of court, with the former manager accepting a £2.5million one-off payment.

Keane has also revealed he launched an expletive-laden rant at Ferguson which ultimately led to his departure from Old Trafford.

Keane spectacularly fell out with Fergie following the then captain's harsh words during an interview with MUTV - which earned the Irishman a £5,000 fine from the club.

Keane reveals that assistant Carlos Queiroz accused him of showing a lack of loyalty to his team-mates after his MUTV interview in which he tore into a number of the then United stars.

Ferguson stepped in to quell the row, saying: 'That’s enough. I’ve had enough of all this stuff.

Keane responded by saying: 'You as well gaffer. We need f****** more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We're slipping behind other teams.'

When goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar chipped in and suggested Keane could have used a 'different tone' the reply was robust.

'Edwin, why don’t you shut the f*** up? You’ve been at this club for two minutes and you’ve done more interviews than I’ve done in my 12 years. It was MUTV – I had to do it.'

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'
