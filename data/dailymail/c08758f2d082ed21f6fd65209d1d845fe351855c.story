Philadelphia sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior, and it was on display once again last night when they learned the Philadelphia Flyers Ice Girls, a swarm of scantily clad, pretty young things responsible for cleaning the ice between periods during home games, had been replaced with an all-male crew.

It all happened when the Flyers took on the Toronto Maple Leafs Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center in a pre-season game, and a group of men, and not women, hit the ice to do some cleaning. 

The boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen, who, unlike their predecessors, got to wear pants and a fleece, went to work on the ice.

Not fan favorites: The girls were ditched in favor of an all-male crew (above), who also get to enjoy clothing more suitable for the frigid temperature on the ice

There is still no word yet on just why the Ice Girls were replaced, but one of the group's former members, Erika Choi Smith, did break the news on her Twitter this August.

'No #FlyersIceGirls this year, but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @FlyersNation & to all #Flyers Fans for being AWESOME,' she wrote.

The girls would hit the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff-baring top, hot pants, leg warmers and their skates, not the best outfit for a place where the temperatures is around 50 degrees.

The Philadelphia Flyers also play an outdoor classic every year, where the temperature is about 20 degrees.

Poor treatment: According to a profile published earlier this year, the girls were underpaid, not allowed to speak to the athletes, and could not eat while in costume

Mother Jones wrote an article about the Ice Girls last year, and the all-female cleaning crew for another hockey team, the  Los Angeles Kings, highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too.

Among other things, the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes, being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in. 

This negative coverage could be why the Ice Girls were replaced by the new all-male cleaning crew.
