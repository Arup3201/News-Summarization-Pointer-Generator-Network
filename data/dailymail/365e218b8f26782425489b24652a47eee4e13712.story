Hillary Clinton is not the only political heavyweight who used her personal email to discuss government affairs while in office.

Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida who is considering a run for president, used his private account while he was in office to discuss a variety of topics.

These included 'security and military issues such as troop deployments to the Middle East and the protection of nuclear plants.'

The Washington Post reports that these emails also included 'two series of exchanges involving details of Florida National Guard troop deployments after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.'

Bush aides told the paper that none of the emails contained classified information and that most of the information was already public knowledge.

This comes just over a week after Bush publicly attacked Clinton for using her personal email while serving as Secretary of State.

'For security purposes, you need to be behind a firewall that recognizes the world for what it is, and it’s a dangerous world, and security would mean that you couldn’t have a private server,' said Bush in an interview with Radio Iowa. 

'It’s a little baffling, to be honest with you, that didn’t come up in Secretary Clinton’s thought process.'

Communications director Tim Miller said of this new report; 'This Democrat opposition research dump of a few innocuous e-mails that Gov. Bush voluntarily posted on a Web site only highlights how large the gap is between him and Clinton in the area of transparency.'

Johannes Ullrich, a cybersecurity expert, outlines the problem however with using a personal account, which is far easier to get in to for a hacker.

'The bigger issue here is, what else can an attacker do?' he said. 

'Now I may be able to penetrate a National Guard commander’s laptop by infecting it or by impersonating Jeb Bush’s account. . . . Now you may even be able to give the order to remove troops or change deployments.'

The Democratic National Committee said they still have questions for Bush, with spokeswoman Holly Shulman saying; 'The GOP presidential hopefuls’ attacks on this issue are completely disingenuous, and there are still a litany of questions Republicans need to answer, like what e-mails has Jeb Bush not turned over?'
