Real Madrid host Barcelona on Saturday in the first Clasico of the season. The two most successful sides in La Liga have played out many memorable games over the years and here, Sportsmail picks the top 10.

10. At No 10 it’s Real Madrid and Barcelona’s first ever Clasico Spanish Cup final all the way back in 1936 in a game that took place a month before Civil War broke out Spain. Madrid took a two-goal lead but Barcelona came back strongly and only an incredible late save from Ricardo Zamora prevented a last-minute Barca equaliser. For many years the most expensive goalkeeper in Spain, Zamora still gives his name to the annual award for the best stopper in La Liga.

9. Nothing summed up the never-ending conspiracy theories about the referee being either a Barca or a Madrid fan than the Clasico Cup final of 1968. It was won 1-0 by Barcelona thanks to a first-half own goal from Madrid’s Fernando Zunzunegui. The main protagonist, however, was referee Antonio Rigo. A suspected Barcelona fan, he turned down two clear penalty appeals in the second half provoking a shower of glass bottles to be thrown on the pitch. Madrid fans sarcastically sang the referee’s name when the trophy was awarded.

8. One of the most famous images from the history of the Clasico has to be Raul putting his finger to his lips and silencing the Nou Camp after equalising in a 1999 league fixture. Raul had scored the first goal but Barca had taken the lead through Rivaldo and Luis Figo. The Spain captain had the last word with the equaliser with just five minutes left of what was the last meeting in the 20th century.

7. Three years later Figo was the main attraction at the Nou Camp as he returned to his old club wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He had been back before but this was the first time he had been brave enough to take any corners. Missiles rained down on him – including the famous pig’s head – and the referee, Luis Medina, stopped the game for 16 minutes. Barca won 2-0 with current coach Luis Enrique scoring one of the goals.

6. In December 2003 David Beckam played his first Clasico at the Nou Camp for Real Madrid and helped them end a 20-year-run without a win at the home of their great rivals. Patrick Kluivert scored for Barcelona but Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo gave Real Madrid the points.

5. Ronaldinho worked a miracle in November 2005 when he brought the Santiago Bernabeu to its feet after one of his greatest individual performances. He scored twice and Samuel Eto’o once in a 3-0 win for Barcelona. Madrid were awful but their supporters showed their class with the appreciation of Ronaldinho’s brilliance.

4. He didn’t get the ovation but he did get a hat-trick at the Bernabeu in March 2007. Leo Messi took on Madrid single-handedly and came away with a point. Ruud van Nistelrooy scored twice and Sergio Ramos got the third for Madrid but Messi – yet to really explode as a striker under Pep Guardiola – managed to score all three on his full debut in the fixture.

3. In joint third place two recent cup finals. Jose Mourinho turned up to end Barcelona’s reign in Spain and in his first season he inflicted a telling blow with 1-0 win in the 2011 Spanish Cup final. He had to wait until the 103rd minute before the goal came but with Ronaldo heading in an Angel di Maria cross the white half of Valencia’s Mestalla stadium could celebrate a famous win. Back in the same stadium last year Madrid and Barca were heading for a draw when the Cardiff Express Gareth Bale ran from the halfway line – leaving the pitch at one point – to get a glorious winner.

2. Last March Barcelona’s season was falling off the edge of a cliff when they went to the Bernabeu and beat Real Madrid in a 4-3 thriller to put them back in the title race. Messi scored yet another hat-trick to make himself the all-time top scorer in the fixture, passing Alfredo Di Stefano’s record and taking his own haul to 21.

1. Top of the pile for sheer quality of performance has to be the 6-2 win for Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu in May 2009. In one of the single greatest team performances in this fixture, Barcelona destroyed Real Madrid. It was the first time Guardiola had opted to play Messi in a central position with Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto’o playing wide. It worked like a dream and Madrid were humbled.
