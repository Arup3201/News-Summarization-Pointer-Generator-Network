This is the moment a best man and the organiser of a sham wedding stopped at BHS to pick up a wedding 
dress and tiara for the fake bride on the way to the ceremony.

Nigerian-born Abiola Kumoye and Ayodeji Abbis have been jailed after admitting their part in the elaborate plot to keep fellow Nigerian and University of Hull masters student Jayeola Abiola in the country by holding a sham wedding held in Hull, East Yorkshire.

Law student Abbis agreed on the 
morning of the wedding to be best man for £1,000, yet had never met the 
groom until they arrived at the wedding venue.

The
27-year-old denied knowing it was a sham or that he was paid £1,000, 
claiming the money was owed to him by an associate of Abiola.

Prosecutor Edward Bindloss said: 'Was it a coincidence the money was paid in to his account on the same day of the wedding?

'This
was his reward for being a valued and important part of that sham 
marriage. He was the best man for a complete stranger and there to make 
money.'

Abiola faced being booted out of Britain because his visa was running out and had planned to pay others £5,000 for organising the wedding at Hull’s Guildhall.

He even picked Celine Dion’s The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face as the wedding song for the big day.

Father-of-two, Kumoye, 34, was paid £2,150 by Abiola for 'luring' the bride, Portuguese-born Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes and providing her with his ex-wife’s passport.

Kumoye and Pinheiro-Fernandes
then travelled in convoy with Abbis from Leeds to Hull on the day of 
the wedding, stopping off at British Home Stores to pick up her wedding 
dress and tiara.

Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes was jailed for eight months for being a fake bride. Officers of the UK Border Agency had been tipped off by the Hull Registrar that the couple seemed to barely know each other

Abbis said he only went because he was not working at the British Gas call centre that day and 'had nothing else to do'.

When the wedding party arrived UK Border 
Agency officers, who were tipped off by a suspicious Hull registrar 
after the couple seemed to barely know each other during their rehearsal
interview, were waiting.

Kumoye and Abbis were arrested and charged with conspiracy to breach immigration laws in January.

The bride and groom were jailed for eight and 12 months respectively in July.

Abbis was sentenced to eight months while Kumoye was jailed for 16 months.

Judge Singh said: 'If it wasn’t for the eagle-eyed registrar, it would have gone ahead, everything was planned.

'The groom had even chosen the rather apt song of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. This offence strikes at the heart of immigration and marriage itself.'
