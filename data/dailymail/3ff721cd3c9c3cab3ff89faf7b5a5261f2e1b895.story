It has not been the best of weeks for Angelina Jolie. First she was accused of being ‘a minimally talented spoiled brat’ in a leaked email – and now it has been revealed the Oscar winner has contracted chickenpox.

The 39-year-old star was covered in small red spots in a video released yesterday on the Universal Studios’ website in which she said she would miss the premiere of her new £70 million movie Unbroken in Los Angeles tomorrow. ‘I found out last night I have chickenpox,’ she said. ‘I will be home, itching, and missing everyone.’

It is unclear whether Jolie contracted the highly contagious disease from one of her six children.

The actress was one of dozens of high-profile names embroiled in the scandal engulfing Sony last week after hackers infiltrated the studio’s computer system and released more than 33,000 private emails and documents.

It was revealed that Hollywood film producer Scott Rudin – who made films such as The Social Network and The Queen – sent a message to studio head Amy Pascal in which he blasted Jolie as having ‘a rampaging ego’.

He added: ‘She is a minimally talented spoiled brat.’
