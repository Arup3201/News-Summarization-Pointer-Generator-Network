A stray kitten who lost her right front paw in a mousetrap while looking for food has been adopted by new owners.

The tiny black and white cat was almost killed by her curiosity when the trap slammed shut on her leg and left her facing an agonising and slow death.

But luckily a passer-by heard her faint cries coming from a garden in Lewknor, Oxfordshire, and took her to a local pet charity.

Staff named her Babybel after the small cheese and sent her to an animal hospital in London where vets performed the amputation.

Despite having only three legs, Babybel is fearless say her new owners and 'jumps around like a rabbit'

Cristina Bull, a veterinary surgeon at the charity, said that the trap had caused irreversible neurological damage which, along with an infection to the wound, had prompted the amputation.

She said: 'Babybel was very lucky she was found otherwise she wouldn't have survived much longer.' 

She was then taken in by the Blue Cross animal rescue charity who feared her injury would prevent her from finding a new home.

But Babybel can now look forward to a life of comfort after being adopted by animal lover Tasha Henderson who wanted a friend for her four-year-old cat George.

Tasha, 37, mother to three-year-old son Albie, said that the cat was 'fearless' despite her traumatic ordeal - and still loves to nibble on a piece of cheese.

Tasha, who lives with her husband Adrian, 40, in Thame, Oxon, said: 'We wanted to get a kitten and had been on the list at Blue Cross for three months.

'Then we saw the pictures of her and thought she was adorable.

'We've had her a couple of weeks now and she's absolutely mad. she jumps all over the place like a rabbit.

'She is totally fearless and after what happened she isn't scared of anything. She will even eat cheese.'

Blue Cross has cared for over 40,000 sick, injured and homeless pets every year since it opened the world's first animal hospital in 1906.
