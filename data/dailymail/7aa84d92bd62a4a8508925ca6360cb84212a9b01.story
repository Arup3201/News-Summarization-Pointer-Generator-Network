Customers could soon be able to pay cheques in to their bank account from the comfort of the armchairs under a new scheme being pushed by ministers.

Instead of having to queue up at a bank to deposit a cheque, they will be able simply to take a photo of it on the smartphone and send it to their bank.

It means the money will be in their account within two days rather than up to six as at present.

The Treasury will consult next year on whether to loosen the rules around cheques and enable hi-tech cheque clearing to be introduced in the UK.

It will be a boon to all those who receive cheques from grandma at Christmas but have to traipse to the bank and then wait ages for the money to come through.

And ministers promise that the older generation who may not have smartphones will still be able to deposit cheques in the traditional manner.

Sajid Javid, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘This government is determined to create a banking sector that works for consumers and serves businesses.

‘We want to see more innovation so that customers see the benefits of new technologies. That is why we’re creating a new payments regulator and why we are going to consult on speeding up the cheque clearing process.

‘We want to take the very best of the current system and make it better. We want to cheques to have a crucial role in the ongoing success of the UK.’

Despite the advent of internet banking, cheques are still a crucial part of the British payments landscape.

Nearly £840billion of cheques were processed last year, accounting for 10 per cent of all payments made by individuals.

Some 23million cheques were sent as gifts because they are still the most trusted method of sending money through the post.

Businesses too rely on cheques: in 2012 they accounted for more than 370million cheque transactions. A quarter of payments made by small businesses were by cheque.

The Treasury says however that it must take steps to secure their long term future.

Next year, the government will consult on introducing legislation to speed up cheque payments to reinforce its relevance and trustworthiness in 21st century Britain.

The cheque processing technology the Treasury wants to introduce here is already widely used in the US.

In Britain, Barclays is planning to introduce cheque deposit on mobile phones next year. Customers without smartphones will be able to use similar technology at cashpoints or branches or continue to pay in paper as they do now.

So-called ‘cheque imaging’ does not require a hard copy of the cheque to be present at every stage of the paying-in process. That means that time spent transferring it between different banks and central clearing depots is saved as well as reducing the overall costs.

John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Many of our members, and their customers, still rely on cheques so will be pleased with the investment and innovation to ensure their continued use.

‘Speeding up cheque payments into business accounts is to be welcomed as many find the current process frustratingly slow. Using smartphones is an interesting idea which should allow firms in areas, particularly where bank branches are closing, to be able to accept cheques as a method of payment.’

Steven Roberts, managing director of Barclays Bank, said: ‘We’re excited to be the first bank to pilot this new technology and always welcome legislation which enables the whole industry to work together to make customers lives easier.

‘These changes mean you will be able to pay cheques in instantly, not just in branch, but also using your smartphone or tablet computer. When you can download a book or a film in seconds, we believe you should be able to deposit a cheque in the same way.

‘We are planning to test the cheque imaging technology early in the New Year with a range of customers.’

Alan Smith, head of payments and banking services at the Post Office, said: ‘Post Office welcomes today’s announcement from government on next year’s consultation for cheque imaging.

‘This announcement is great news for our customers and will bring about a move for much needed improvements for clearing and processing cheques, including the move from paper to cheque imaging.’

Gillian Guy, chief execitive of Citizens Advice, said: ‘Cheques are an important, and sometimes vital, method of payment for many CAB clients.

‘It’s good to see plans to bring cheques into the modern age with digital imaging and faster payments being introduced, alongside continued use the more traditional paper cheques.  It’s important these developments don’t bring extra costs or barriers for consumers.’
