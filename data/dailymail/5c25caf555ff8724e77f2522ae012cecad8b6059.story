Most of us are guilty of tucking into the odd sandwich while hunched over our desks but while eating lunch at the office might seem harmless, experts say it is quite the opposite.

According to researchers, people who regularly eat at their desks or in the office canteen are not only more likely to be obese, they also tend to have lower levels of vitamins and sky high cholesterol as well.

The findings are the result of a new study that looked at the link between health and the number of meals eaten away from home.

Bad move: Those who ate at their desks six or more times a week were more likely to be obese or overweight

'We found participants who ate six or more meals a week away from home had a higher body mass index and lower concentrations of high-density lipoprotein - a molecule that removes excess cholesterol from the blood,' Ashima Kant, who led the study, told The Sunday Times.

'They also had lower concentrations of nutrients, including vitamins C and E, in their blood. This effect was found to be more pronounced in women and in adults over the age of 50.'

The study looked at 8,314 people over five years and focused on the relationship between participants' health and the number of meals eaten outside the home.

Although many did eat meals in fast food restaurants, the study was designed to look beyond traditionally unhealthy foods and at people who chose 'healthy' options from high street cafes such as Pret A Manger.

Unhealthy: 64 per cent of British adults are overweight or obese (left) and office lunches (right) don't help

Interestingly, the results held true for all meals eaten outside the home, regardless of whether workers made a healthy choice or not.

Obesity is becoming an increasingly weighty problem in the UK, with the most recent figures showing that 24.4 per cent of British men are obese and 25 per cent of women.

In total, 64 per cent of all British adults can be classed as overweight or obese, according to NHS figures.

As a result, public spending on obesity is set to rise to £50m a year, with sharp rises in heart-attacks, diabetes and strokes expected.
