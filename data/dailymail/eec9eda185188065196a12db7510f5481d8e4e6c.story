A woman was forced to deliver her nephew in a hospital car park and then give him the kiss of life after doctors sent his mother home prematurely.

First-time mother Kirsty Brook, 30, had been to 
hospital on November 13 fearing she was in labour, even though her baby wasn't due for another five weeks.

But staff told her she simply had a urine infection and sent her home at 2pm that day.

By 8pm it was clear Ms Brooke was indeed in  labour, so her sister, Michelle Brook-Lomas, drove her to hospital.

However baby Harry was in such a rush to enter the world that she was forced to deliver him outside the entrance of Calderdale Royal Hospital in Halifax, West Yorkshire.

And moments after delivering the little boy, she realised he wasn't breathing.

Quick-thinking Ms Brook-Lomas, a former childminder, wiped the mucus from her tiny nephew’s mouth and gave him the kiss of life. Seconds later he began to cry.

Medics rushed baby Harry into the hospital to check him over before reuniting him with his mother and father Mark.

Baby Harry, who weighed 6st 3lb, was kept in hospital for five days and spent the first 24 hours in an incubator with oxygen and a heat lamp.

Ms Brook, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, has now hit out at her treatment, saying the outcome could have been very different if it wasn’t for her sister.

She said: 'I feel disgruntled about 
it. I was a first-time mum, I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t 
know the difference between contractions and a water infection.

'It felt like they were trying to fob me off, as if they were saying ‘don’t be silly, you’re not in labour’.

'It was surreal, like it was happening to someone else. I just wanted to get to the hospital. 'Thankfully Michelle was there or else Harry may not have been here today. She was brilliant.'

'It wasn't the birth I was expecting,' said first-time mother Miss Brook

Full-time mother-of-three Ms Brook-Lomas, 34, who used her baby first-aid training from her former job as a childminder, said: 'I had asked Kirsty a few times if she wanted me to pull over as we drove to hospital but she said "‘just get me there".

'As we were approaching the hospital she said she wanted to push and when I saw the car park, I just did a handbrake turn across four spaces near the entrance, jumped out and Mark raced in to get the midwife.

'Kirsty was in the back seats and I talked her through it. It all happened within minutes.

'When the baby arrived he had mucus in his mouth so I wiped it out. He wasn’t breathing so I gave him the kiss of life, then he started crying and I gave him to Kirsty to do skin-to-skin.

'The medics came and the umbilical cord was cut before he was taken inside.'

Ms Brook said: 'I was overjoyed when Harry started to cry. We all were. It wasn’t the birth I was expecting.'

'I felt my waters break that morning, but the hospital put a baby monitor on me, checked me over and sent me home.

'The pains kept getting worse and by about 8pm I went to my sister’s home and she suggested I have a bath.

'When I got out we timed the contractions at three minutes and phoned the hospital and they said to come in. 

'I saw the doctor who sent us home 
the next day and he said to me "I’m so sorry, I haven’t got X-ray eyes. I
honestly believed you had a water infection".'

Baby Harry is now back at home with his parents. His mother added: 'He is wonderful. We are over the moon.'

A spokesperson for Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are sorry to learn of these concerns and we would urge Miss Brook to contact us so we can discuss them with her.'
