One man has given new meaning to the term 'porta potty.'

Union Hardware owner David Goldberg uploaded a video of his custom-built creation 'Loo-cy' to YouTube on Tuesday.

The clip reveals that 'Loo-cy' is in fact a motorized toilet, and has a plow in front. On its platform, a toilet paper stand and some reading material are included.

Long life: Before being used in a snowplow design, the toilet was called 'Loo-Cille,'  incorporated into a float and showcased at D.C. area events

'Taking something very private and making it a spectacle is a jolt to the system by itself. But having it plow snow... Over the top!' the video's description says.

The clip of Goldberg sitting on the throne as his machine plows a snowy sidewalk has already garnered over 57,000 YouTube views.

Goldberg told Bethesda Magazine that the video's popularity 'shocked the hell out of me.'

'I'm really surprised about it, but when you look back, all the news at the time was about the snow, so it makes sense,' he told the website.

Union Hardware's website says of the machine 'Introducing Loo-cy. Our Hybrid [sic] motorized Loo.. Loo-cy was first introduced in the DC Pride parade in 2014 as Loo-Cille. (white and pink) Next was a breakthough [sic] apearance [sic] at a car show in Potomac, Md, where Loo-Cille won 2nd place.'

Design: Goldberg's 'Loo-cy' features two pedals, lacking brakes and a steering wheel

It continues 'When Loo-Cille was enterend [sic] in the Back to Betehsda [sic] car show during the Taste of Betehsda [sic], Loo-Cille got a make-over and became the Loo-cy that you see today. After 2 car shows, Loo-cy entered an air show in Gaithersburg, Md, where it delighted the crowd around the runway. When the winter hit, Loo-cy was fitted with a snowplow. The a [sic] video was taken and the crowd went wild.' 

The Washington Post reported that before those events, Goldberg made a 'snow bathroom' one year ago outside Union Hardware.

Goldberg told the newspaper 'People are more attracted to toilets - this very private thing - out in public. I built an entire snow bathroom, but it's always the toilet people laugh at. ...They loved the toilet.' 

The newspaper reported that 'Loo-cy' was designed by Goldberg, and features two pedals, lacking brakes and a steering wheel.

Goldberg told the Washington Post that the same toilet style is available for purchase inside Union Hardware. 

Look out! Goldberg's 'Loo-cy' also has a warning signs which say 'Heads up!'
