Spider-Man may regularly swoop in to save Gwen Stacy from his foes, but this time he failed to catch the 'damsel in distress' during a stunt in Times Square ahead of New Year’s Eve celebrations.

The superhero dropped Good Morning America reporter Sara Haines as she pretended to faint in his presence, expecting him to catch her. Instead she fell flat on her back and burst into laughter.

The botched TV stunt comes as Times Square prepares to welcome one million revellers to watch the famous ball drop at midnight.

Nearby, restaurant Applebee’s - the chain best known for two-for-$20 dinner specials – is charging $375 for a New Year’s Eve ticket despite not being able to guarantee ball drop views.

The menu for the evening, billed as 'a night to remember,’ will begin at 8pm and end at midnight, at which time guests can 'make their way to the streets of Times Square'.

Laugh it off: Despite falling flat on her back thanks to the bumbling superhero, Ms Haines laughed it off, even giving Spider-Man a hug

Applebee’s website states that a viewing of the ball drop is 'subject to NYPD approval.' 

Ultimately, the NYPD has control over whether or not to allow partiers spilling out of bars and restaurants to move along in order to allow space for people who showed up earlier in the day. 

Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, said: ‘Security is much more tightly controlled and there are so many people.’

Tickets for chain TGI Friday's party range from $225 for general admission which includes trays of chicken fingers and potato skins, to $1,095 for the 'Couples Champagne VIP Package'. 

For guests who do not mind skipping dinner, Cipriani's New Year's Eve party starts at $150 per person and includes 'premium top-shelf alcohol' and a prosecco toast at midnight - but no food. 

As revellers start to queue to get the best spot to see the ball drop at midnight, the NYPD have ramped up security, which has increased each year since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Time for 2014: A living Statue of Liberty stands in Times Square, where police are making sure security is tight, searching people for explosives and directing revellers into pens along Broadway and Seventh Avenue

Queue for a view: Just like New Year's Eve in Times Square in 2008 (pictured), people began arriving in Times Square several hours before the celebrations are due to begin in a bid to get the best view

A night to remember: As the clock struck midnight on January 1 2013 hundreds of thousands of party-goers were sprinkled with confetti

According to the New York Daily News, the Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins said: ‘Times Square would be the biggest potential place for any kind of terorist action, kind of like the Boston bombing.’

Revellers will be searched for explosives and other dangerous contraptions as they are directed to pens along Broadway, Seventh Avenue and uptown from 43rd Street to Central Park.

Backpacks are prohibited and there are no trash cans on the streets. The roads will be closed to vehicles from 3pm today.

America is set to ring in a very chilly new year with meteorologists predicting bitterly cold weather around the country.

Two weather systems are expected to merge and bring a major snowstorm to New England as early as Thursday. It will also bring chilly temperatures and possibly single-digit temperatures to New York City. For revelers in Times Square, temperatures are forecast to plunge through the 20s in New York City on New Year's Eve.

'Some all-time record lows could be challenged in parts of southern Quebec, northern New England and northern upstate New York, when the core of the cold air settles in Wednesday night,' according to AccuWeather Canada Weather Expert Brett Anderson.
