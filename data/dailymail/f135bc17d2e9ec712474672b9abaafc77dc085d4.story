Happier times: Marilyn Dershowitz with her husband Nathan. Mrs Dershowitz died Saturday after being hit by a mail truck

Marilyn Dershowitz, 68, died Saturday after being hit by a mail truck in New York City during an afternoon bike ride with her husband.

Mrs Dershowitz was the sister-in-law of celebrity lawyer, author and long-time Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz.

Mrs Dershowitz was hit by a United States Postal Service truck on West 29th St. near Ninth Avenue in the Chelsea neighbourhood just 
after 12 p.m., sending her crashing to the pavement, the New York Daily News reported.

Bleeding badly from the head, the wounded bike rider was rushed to Bellevue Medical Center, where she died shortly after, reports the paper.

Nathan Dershowitz, 71, was riding his bike just paces ahead of his wife.

Mr Dershowitz told the Daily News: 'She stopped at a light and I went on ahead. A block later I stopped and turned around, and I saw the 
lights from the police cars'.

Mr Dershowitz raced back to the scene, where he saw his wife bleeding.

He later told the New York Post: 'Bellevue spent nearly an hour on her, with 20 physicians trying to resuscitate her'.

Investigators told the Daily News they believe Mrs Dershowitz was pedalling her silver mountain bike west with the traffic on 29th St. when she was hit by a mid-sized postal vehicle.

Mr Dershowitz told the paper: 'The cars behind me said two cars tried to make it through the light, and neither wanted to give, and she was caught between a car and a truck'.

The truck drove off immediately, but investigators said they didn't think the driver knew he had even struck the woman.

Police reportedly found the postal worker later and questioned him. They added that the accident was captured on surveillance video.

Mr Dershowitz said he and his wife were headed to the West Side bike path.

He said: 'We're rarely in the city on weekends, and we had all kinds of nice things planned.

'I bought tickets for a boat ride up the Hudson to see the 4th of July fireworks'.

It is not known if Mrs Dershowitz was wearing a helmet.

Mr and Mrs Dershowitz had two grown children and three grandchildren, and they lived in the Tudor City complex on the far east side of Manhattan. 

Mrs Dershowitz was a retired Manhattan Supreme Court Special Referee (a judge) and her husband is a criminal defence lawyer.

During her time in the Civil Branch of the New York State Supreme Court, Mrs Dershowitz oversaw a number of high-profile divorce trials, including the 2006 case of Dr. Nicholas Bartha, who blew up his upper East Side home rather than turn it over to his wife.

Mr Dershowitz told the Post: 'She retired just six months ago so that we could do some enjoying 
life'.

The couple were reportedly planning on spending a few weeks 
with their grandchildren, who live in the area.

'She was looking forward to that', said Mr Dershowitz.

Mrs Dershowitz's brother-in-law, Alan Dershowitz, has served as a high-profile lawyer for O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, and Jim Bakker.

In 1984, he convinced a court to overturn the sensational conviction of British socialite Claus von Bülow for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny.

Alan Dershowitz is also the author of several bestselling books about politics and law, including Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von Bülow Case (1985); Chutzpah (1991); Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O.J. Simpson Case (1996); The Case for Israel (2003); and Rights From Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights (2004).

A film was based on his 1985 book.
