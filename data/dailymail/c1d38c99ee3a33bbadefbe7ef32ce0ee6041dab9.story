Six of the children killed in the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook school were gunned down as they made a brave escape attempt, it emerged today.

The first-graders had been hidden in a closet by teacher Victoria Soto when the first gunshots rang out at the elementary School in Newtown on Friday morning.

When the gunman entered the classroom looking for the children, he came face-to-face with 27-year-old Miss Soto who tried to throw him off by saying the children were in the auditorium at the other end of the building.

However six of the children then tried to run from their hiding place and were shot dead by the gunman. Miss Soto and a teacher's aide were also killed.

The remaining seven petrified first-graders were later found in the closet by first responders at the Connecticut school.

Neil Heslin told the New York Post that his son Jesse Lewis was one of the children who tried to make a run for it.

Mr Heslin said: 'I wish my kid stayed put. But that’s Jesse. I can see him making that choice and just doing something. My boy died the way I would have died if I was in that position.'

He added: 'Jesse grew up on a farm. He’s tough. That would be my little guy to try to get out of there.'

Miss Soto had worked at Sandy Hook Elementary for five years. Soto was a highly regarded young teacher who was popular with her pupils.

One young student, Jacob
 Riley, told MailOnline that Soto was known for chewing gum in class - something not
 usually allowed for teachers. He said he had often teased her about her 
habit and she had playfully teased him back.

'She
 took her kids, put them in the closet and by doing so she lost her life
 protecting those little ones,' Soto's cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News.

'She was found huddled over her
 children, her students, doing instinctively what she knew was the right
 thing. I'm just proud that Vicki had the instincts to protect her kids from harm,' he continued.

'It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children and in our eyes she's a hero,' he added.

A deeply distraught 10-year-old boy who is a former student of Miss Soto described her as 'really nice and funny.'

Four teachers were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School 
trying to save their students from gunman Adam Lanza.

The other three teachers have been identified as principal 
Dawn Hochsprung, 47, school psychologist Mary Sherlach, 56, and Lauren Rousseau, 30. Devastated friends of Rousseau said she was having 'the best year of her life' after landing her first full-time teaching job only months ago.

Twenty-eight
 people died in the shooting rampage, including 20 young children, the gunman who took 
his own life and his mother Nancy Lanza, who was shot before the school massacre.

When
 Lanza started firing at the school in suburban Newtown, Connecticut, 
some teachers dove under tables - but Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach didn't hesitate.

They ran into the hallway to confront the danger and were murdered execution-style as a result.

Diane Day, a school therapist, told the Wall Street Journal that she and several other teachers were in a meeting with Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach when the shooting began.

'We were there for about five minutes chatting and we heard, "pop pop pop,"' she said. 'I went under the table.'

The
 principal and the school psychologist had other ideas. They jumped out 
of their seats and ran toward the sound of the gunfire.

'They didn’t think twice about confronting or seeing what was going on,' Ms Day added.

Rabbi Shaul Praver told MSNBC that Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach were killed execution-style.

Tributes for all educators poured in on Friday night. Former school superintendent John Reed told the Connecticut Post that Mrs Sherlach was warm and cared deeply for her students.

'If
 there ever was a person, by qualifications and personality, to work 
with children, to be a school psychologist, it was Mary,' he said.

She
 was married with two grown daughters in their 20s and enjoyed 
gardening, reading and the theater, according to her school biography.

Friends and neighbors said it was immediately clear to everyone she knew that she loved her students and her school.

'I don’t think you could find a more positive place to bring students to every day,' she had recently told a local newspaper.

Another tale of heroism came from an eight-year-old student who said a teacher pulled him from the hallway as bullets rang out.

'I saw some of the bullets going down the hall that I was right next to and then a teacher pulled me into her classroom,' the boy told CBS News.

'It sounded like someone was kicking a door,' he said of the piercing sound of the gunfire.

His relieved mother agreed, saying that the teacher saved her son's life.
