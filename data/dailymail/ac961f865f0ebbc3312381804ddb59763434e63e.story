Stock markets have endured another 
roller-coaster day as brokers digest details of a rescue plan for the Eurozone being drawn up by finance ministers - and there are signs that the markets are improving.

Reports
 from the weekend suggested a £2.6trillion plan was being drawn up to allow Greece to escape 
repayment on half of its towering debt and to quadruple the size of 
Europe's bailout fund.

The
 International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been co-ordinating talks with 
leaders in Washington and has reportedly drawn up a plan aimed at 
providing a way for Greece to manage a default on its debt, which now 
stand at 160 per cent of its GDP.

And Banks rallied on hopes that a deal may be near with Barclays the biggest FTSE 100 riser, up 7 per cent. 

The FTSE 100 index of leading shares opened down 2 per cent this morning but by the end of Monday there was a 22 point rise

It
 is thought the plan will include a 50 per cent write down to those debts, 
with private investors, notably eurozone banks, suffering huge losses on
 the Greek government debt they hold.

This morning the
 FTSE 100 Index opened below 5000, after a drop of more than 90 points, 
but later recovered to stand 52 points higher at 5118.7 - however by 
closing, the market was up 0.45 per cent or just 22.5 points.

European markets also moved forward 
with both the CAC-40 in Paris and Dax in Frankfurt posting gains of more
 than 2 per cent despite a closely watched survey of German business 
confidence sinking again in September.

Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC
 Partners, predicted a roller-coaster ride for markets while details of 
the plan are thrashed out.

She said: 'A sufficiently credible 
plan to solve the eurozone crisis will necessitate changes to treaties, 
laws, and not least the German constitution.

'There will be wobbles and 
uncertainty at every vote and stage of political implementation.'

According the BBC's Robert Peston, the deal could involve a write-down of half of Greece's massive government debt.

But Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos dismissed reports that he has discussed a scenario of an orderly default by Athens with International Monetary Fund Chief Christine Lagarde and European Central Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet.   

'We have reached a point where there are reports about what has been said in a closed door meeting with the participation of only Mrs Lagarde, Mr Trichet and myself,' he said in a statement.

'What is absolutely sure is that there hasn't been and couldn't have been any discussion about the so-called scenario of an orderly default.'    

However the International Monetary 
Fund last night issued an extraordinary warning that it might not have 
enough cash to stem the crisis engulfing the Eurozone, prompting fears 
that Britain could be forced to find billions more to bail out 
debt-stricken economies.

Chancellor George Osborne has refused to put British funds on the line for a new EU rescue scheme but he would be unable to resist a call from the IMF to do more.

The dramatic development came as 
France was forced to deny speculation that it is on the brink of having 
to bail out its banking system.

Emergency plans are being drawn up for a 
£2.6trillion deal aimed at saving the euro by allowing Greece to default
 on its massive debts.

The funds would be used to create a 
‘firewall’ around the most indebted Eurozone countries, allow for an 
‘orderly’ Greek default on its towering debts, and bail out those 
European banks most at risk.

Traders saw a further fall in the price of gold today as the traditional safe haven in times of economic turmoil continued its surprise descent.

The precious metal is down by more than 300 U.S. dollars per ounce in the last three weeks, from a record peak of 1921 U.S. dollars an ounce on September 6 to less than 1600 U.S. dollars today.

Experts are at odds as to why gold and silver prices have fallen, with some citing a drop in global price pressures and others saying the commodity has been overbought.

CME Group, the world's largest futures market, has also increased the minimum investment value to cover itself amid market uncertainty.

The recent dive in economic confidence should inspire a flight to gold - as the metal tends to outperform other commodities in times of crisis and also acts as a hedge against inflation.

Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said two of the pillars that supported investors' confidence in gold have been 'knocked away' - namely fears of a surge in inflation and a collapse in the U.S. dollar.

He said: 'The 300 US dollar fall in the price of gold has caught most commentators by surprise - including us.

'Demand for gold as an inflation hedge has fallen as the global economy has slowed and other commodity prices have tumbled.'

Former
 Chancellor Alistair Darling warned yesterday that the world is facing a
 bigger economic crisis than it did three years ago.

‘The Greek crisis has been allowed  to run on and on and on,’ Mr Darling said.

‘Only this weekend it appears the governments have realised it is only a matter of time before Greece defaults.

‘It is imperative the Eurozone 
countries take action now and not let it drag on for the next few weeks 
because the risk is it will bring down other countries with it.’

He added: ‘The situation today is more
 serious than it was three years ago. There are lessons to be learnt and
 they are not being learnt by those responsible at the moment.’

In
 a bid to head off a wave of selling when stock markets re-open today, 
France’s central bank insisted the country’s besieged lenders were  
strong enough to withstand a Greek debt default.

Bank of France governor
 Christian Noyer described as ‘preposterous’ claims that French lenders 
are facing a run on their deposits because of concerns over their 
£36billion  exposure to Greece.

And he rejected reports that the French government was planning to use taxpayers’ cash to shore up the beleaguered banks.

Mr
 Osborne has warned that Europe’s political elite have just six weeks to
 tame the debt storm engulfing the  17-nation single currency – or risk 
pitching the global economy back  into recession.

Following
 its meeting in Washington, the IMF warned that it could run out of cash
 if contagion spreads beyond the crippled periphery of the Eurozone.

Its
 £248billion bailout fund may not be big enough if the global economy 
plunges into the mire because of the debt crisis, according to IMF chief
 Christine Lagarde.

The 
watchdog’s current emergency fund ‘looks comfortable today but pales in 
comparison with the potential financing needs of vulnerable countries 
and crisis bystanders’, Mrs Lagarde warned.  

Global
 leaders are in a race against time to shore up  the Eurozone and 
prevent a Greek default from triggering a full-blown financial meltdown.
 ‘We need a big bazooka,’ said one senior official at the IMF.

World Bank chairman Bob Zoellick said: 
‘[There is] the looming danger that failure to take decisive action in 
Europe and the United States may shake the entire global economy, 
throwing developing countries off track – and they are today’s engine of
 global growth. The key message is that we are closer to the edge.’

The expected default by Greece on its £305billion of sovereign debt will be a huge blow to the credibility of the Eurozone and send shockwaves through the banking systems of Germany, France and Italy.

It will also add fuel to the debate about the viability of a single currency.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble was highly critical of rescuing those countries that had been foolish enough to build up mountains of sovereign debt, arguing they should not be rewarded for their profligacy, saying: ‘You cannot cure an alcoholic by giving him alcohol.’
