Action: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith

Feckless welfare claimants who spend their benefits on drugs and alcohol will be handed smart cards so they can only spend state handouts on food and essentials.

Plans being drawn up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith will see the 120,000 problem families targeted with Oyster-style cards which can only be used in certain shops.

That will mean those who waste their welfare money would only get the cash if it is used for certain items in chosen shops.

Items that could be bought include food, clothes and household essentials.

Mr Duncan Smith has ordered civil servants to draw up a scheme modelled on welfare reforms in Australia, where welfare credit cards have already been used with success.

The first welfare recipients to get the cards are expected to be drug addicts and alcoholics, or those who are problem gamblers, in order to ensure that taxpayers’ money is not used to fuel addiction and dependency.

That could pave the way for payment cards to be used more widely.

Mr Duncan Smith’s aides say he is also keen to use the restricted payouts to help turn around the problem families who are blamed for the epidemic of antisocial behaviour in Britain today.

A report published by Louise Casey, the tsar for troubled families, found that the families who cause the most problems are distinguished by drug and alcohol problems.

The plans would require a change in the law since it is currently illegal for ministers to decree what benefits cash is spent on.

But Mr Duncan Smith believes the proposals would achieve the double benefit of getting better value for taxpayers’ money and help turn round the lives of people who use welfare handouts to fuel their addictive lifestyles.

He revealed his intentions at a fringe meeting at the Tory conference this week.

‘I am looking at the moment at ways 
in which we could ensure that money we give [benefit claimants] to 
support their lives is not used to support a certain lifestyle,’ he 
said.

Asked about Australian use of smart 
cards, he added: ‘I am certainly looking at it - I am going through that
 in some detail. With the use of cards, we are looking at that to see if
 we can do something.

There
 would be some legislative issues that we would have to go through about
 allowing us to say “you cannot spend your money exactly where you like 
it”.’

Prevention: The cards should stop claimants spending their benefits on alcohol

The plans will be controversial since 
defenders of maintaining handouts will accuse the government of 
attempting social engineering.

But
 civil servants are now studying papers on the experience in Australia, 
where the scheme has just been rolled out nationwide after being 
pioneered in Queensland and the Northern Territories.

The Basics cards, as they are called, can only be used to purchase 'priority' items such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care.

The government puts the money electronically on the card once a fortnight, when people receive their benefit payments.

Between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of income is 'quarantined' for essential needs depending on the individual’s circumstances. The rest is available as cash.

Mr Duncan Smith believes the scheme is better than food stamps, which are issued in some American states since those can be swapped for drugs.

A senior official at the Department of Work and Pensions said: ‘Food tokens don’t work because they can be traded on the black market.

Credit cards would not be for everyone claiming benefits but they could be used for extreme cases where people are not good at managing their lives like drug users or those with children living in poverty where money needs to be spent on food and clothes not drugs and alcohol.

‘Iain has asked the civil servants to look into this quickly.’
