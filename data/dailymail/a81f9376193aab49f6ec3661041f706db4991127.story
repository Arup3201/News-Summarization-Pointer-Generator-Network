PC Duncan was carrying out speeding checks with a colleague when the incident happened.

Following the collision on the A217 Reigate Avenue at its junction with Rose Hill in Sutton, police found the vehicle abandoned nearby.

Metropolitan
Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe praised the courage of 
frontline officers this afternoon following the accident.

'An officer injured on duty is always upsetting for all of us in the
Met and our best wishes are with him at this time,' he said.

'We will of course 
ensure that he, his family and his colleagues are being fully supported 
and a thorough investigation into the incident has already begun.

'Whilst
serious injuries on duty are thankfully rare, it is a reminder of the 
courage of our front-line staff when carrying out their role to keep 
London safe.'

Commander Dave Martin said PC Duncan is a 'popular' frontline policeman.

'Andy
is a hard working and committed police officer. He is extremely popular
with everyone he comes into contact with,' he said.

'The
thoughts of the Metropolitan Police are with Andy and his family at 
this distressing time, we are all wishing for his recovery.'

Another officer, who was on patrol with the victim, called an ambulance and PC Duncan was rushed to a nearby hospital.

The road where the man was hit is closed this morning.

Anyone
