The musical climax of the evening was provided by Sir Paul McCartney, the most successful songwriter in British history, who had the crowd singing and swaying.

Smiling widely as he sat playing the piano, the British singer performed two songs: The End and Hey Jude.

Towards the end of the performance he stood up and clapped his hands in the air, encouraging the audience to sing-along.

He asked the men to join in - and then asked the women to get involved, before the whole stadium sang together.

He was watched by his daughter Stella McCartney who has played a key part in designing Team GB's costumes.

Broadcast to a television audience estimated at one billion, Universal Music said an album of the ceremony soundtrack would be on sale 'within moments' of the ceremony ending.

Singer-songwriter Billy Bragg tweeted: 'Impressive though (the opening ceremony) in Beijing was, they didn’t have any great pop music to play, did they?”

The ceremony began gently, with Edward Elgar, the hymn Jerusalem and Danny Boy - but soon started to rock.

Olympic ceremonies often play it safe. 
But Boyle, who brought in the electronic duo Underworld as musical 
directors, gave his show a cheeky edge.

The Sex Pistols, once the outrageous face of punk, were included with their song Pretty Vacant.

Boyle even slipped in a few bars of 
the Pistols’ snarling God Save the Queen (“the fascist regime”) early 
on - although he respectfully did it before Queen Elizabeth II 
had entered the stadium.

In parts, it was like a Union Jack 
jukebox - a medley of tracks from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, 
David Bowie and Queen, the Specials and the Jam, the Stone Roses and 
Eurythmics, and what seemed like dozens more.

The list spanned generations, from 
The Who’s My Generation right up to live performances from two of the 
hottest homegrown acts of the moment.

A dramatic section featuring 75 bikes 
representing the traditional doves which were released at Games from 
ancient times to signal peace, was accompanied by the music of the 
Arctic Monkeys, including their No. 1 hit I Bet You Look Good On The 
Dancefloor

Stand out: Bright neon colours on the dancers' costumes made an effective scene

Dancing feet: A montage of songs were played as brightly-coloured dancers took to the stage

As 
they played to thousands of people in the stadium and millions around 
the world, fireworks surrounding the East London arena lit up the sky.

In a reflection of British humour and the East End there was a version of I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles.

UK Grime MC Dizzee Rascal took to the stage singing his hit song Bonkers - he is a local boy brought up in the East End.

He said: 'It is exciting to be part of 
the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony. It is a good time for 
the UK and I am glad they asked me to perform one of my greatest tracks 
to represent the country.

'Huge respect to all the athletes who are taking part and let's get the party started.'

Emeli
 Sande who sang the hymn Abide With Me said: 'I am extremely proud and 
humbled to be part of the amazing ceremony which will allow the world to
 see some of the best up-and-coming and established talent the UK has 
produced.'

It was written by Henry Fancis Lyte in 1847 and he died three weeks after completing it.

The hymn has been sung at every FA Cup final since 1927.

It is also a regular tune heard at Rugby League internationals.

The musical melange continued during 
the athletes parade, with members of the 204 national teams circling the
 track to everything from West End Girls by the Pet Shop Boys and 
Rolling in the Deep by Adele.

The British squad entered to a roar 
of applause - and Bowie’s anthem-like Heroes, while Pink Floyd played 
during the fireworks display.

A thousand drummers beat out their 
rhythm across the stadium and 80 musicians, aged from seven to 17, 
captivated the crowd as they joined the London Symphony Orchestra for a 
performance of Nimrod by Edward Elgar.

A young male chorister moved the audience to tears last night with a stunning solo during his choir’s rendition of Jerusalem.

Despite a global audience of four 
billion, he kept his composure as he led the Dockhead Choir, from 
Southwark, South East London.

Dressed in yellow striped tops, the 
choir sang a note-perfect version of the song, often associated with 
patriotism and based on the short poem by William Blake.

Looking bored: The London Symphony Orchestra played Chariots of Fire as Mr Bean - actor Rowan Atkinson - took to a keyboard

The Bean way: Half-way through the performance Mr Bean took out his phone and then proceeded to sneeze, while playing one 
key repetitively

Musician Frank Turner took to the 
stage with a band before the opening ceremony.

The English singer folk 
singer played 'I Still Believe' as actors dressed in period clothing 
walked out on to the green scene.

He had previously practiced twice at the venue this week before he made his Olympic debut to the crowd. 

Another act during the night was funnyman Mr Bean.

The London Symphony Orchestra took 
centre stage playing Chariots of Fire as Mr Bean - British actor Rowan 
Atkinson - took to a keyboard.

The performance cut to a video of Mr Bean running down the beach made famous in the opening scene of the 1981 film.

British ceremony: God Saave The Queen was sang by the Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children

Singing out: The pyjama-clad choir ranged from young children to teenagers

Past bedtime: Artists perform on beds during the Opening Ceremony

Oscar winner Boyle, the man 
responsible for the the remarkable transformation of the stadium where 
the athletics will take place, said: 'Tonight's a warm-up act for the 
Games.

'That's one of the things you have to keep remembering.

'You
 big it up for different reasons, and you hear it bigged up or slammed 
or whatever it is and you've got to keep remembering we're the warm-up 
act.'
