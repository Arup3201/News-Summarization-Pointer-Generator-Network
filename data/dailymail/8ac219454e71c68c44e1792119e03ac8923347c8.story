Arsenal scouts will watch Dynamo Kiev centre-back Aleksandar Dragovic against Everton on Thursday.

The 24-year-old Austria international is being touted as one of the best defenders in Europe and is keen to leave Ukraine in the summer.

Kiev want around £15million for him but that has not deterred the likes of Borussia Dortmund who see him as a potential replacement for Mats Hummels.

Manchester United and West Ham have also watched Dragovic closely over recent months. United remain unconvinced about his consistency while any deal may prove too rich for West Ham.

Arsenal have just signed Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal but know they need greater strength in depth as they wrestle with continued injury problems and the inconsistent form of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny.

Manchester United's Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling have also been discussed at Arsenal as they weigh up more summer spending.

Arsene Wenger remains keen on adding another midfielder, full-back and striker to his squad.
