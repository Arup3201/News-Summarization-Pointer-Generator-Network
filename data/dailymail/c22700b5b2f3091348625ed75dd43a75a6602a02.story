The Islamic State has threatened a fresh wave of violence against the Yazidi religious minority in Iraq, saying they will execute 300 families whom they have surrounded in northern Iraq.

It came after the jihadist militant group took hostage hundreds of Yazidi women in their stronghold city of Mosul yesterday, amid warnings that they had 'vicious plans' for their captives.

Fighters for the Islamic State (IS), formerly known as ISIS, continue to lay siege to a mountain near the Turkish border, where as many as 50,000 of the minority - considered apostates and devil-worshippers by IS - have been holed up without food or water.

They today received aid from Kurdish and American forces, who have intervened to protect the embattled minority group after an international outcry.

Tearful: Some children were carried off to safety, but thousands of the religious minority remains stranded on the mountainside 

Under fire: The film crew, embedded with the Kurdish fighters, also saw a firefight between the helicopter gunner and IS forces with anti-aircraft weapons

Persecuted: Yazidi children (pictured) have taken to sheltering in the holy valley of Lalish, while others trapped in the Sinjar Mountains were flown renewed supplies by the U.S. today. The religious minority is not alone in being threatened by the militants, who also say Christians and Shia Muslims are heretics and should convert

Masses of desperate, crying Yazidis were filmed today by a crew from Rudaw news perched in a Kurdish helicopter as water and supplies were dropped, while the chopper came under fire from IS troops below. American plans also dropped supplies, and RAF helicopters were today dispatched to do the same.

The latest threat to the three hundred families - who live in the villages of Koja, Hatimiya and Qaboshi - came after the Sunni militant group surrounded them, according to a Yazidi politician. 

It came as U.S. President Barack Obama said more air strikes were likely around the Sinjar Mountains where the Yazidis are trapped - and refused to give a timetable for how long the offensive might take.

The U.S. and Iraqi governments have stepped up our military assistance to Kurds as they wage this fight,' he said. 'American aircraft are positioned to strike IS terrorists around the mountain to help forces in Iraq break the seige and rescue those who are trapped there.'

He insisted he was pursuing a 'broader strategy' aimed at 'preventing an act of genocide'. 'Ultimately only Iraqis can ensure the stability and security of Iraq', he said. 'The United States can't do it for them.'

But he added: 'We will protect our American citizens in Iraq whether they're diplomats, civilians or military. If these terrorists threaten our facilities or our personnel we will take action to protect our people. 

Threat: Islamic State fighters have continued their relentless sweep through Iraq, causing refugees to flee and carrying out brutal executions on their enemies

'Long-term project': President Barack Obama said today that American involvement, which began yesterday with targeted air strikes, could prove protracted

How events unfolded: Yesterday marked a landmark campaign by the U.S., its first incursion into Iraq by air since troops pulled out of the country in 2011

'We will continue to provide military assistance and advice to the Iraqi government as they battle these terrorists so they cannot establish a safe haven.

'This morning I spoke with Prime Minister Cameron of the UK and President Hollande of France and I'm pleased that both leaders agree with our strong support. Once again America is proud to act alongside our closest friends and allies.'

The haul on the C130 Hercules aircraft includes clean water, tents and tarpaulins for up to 75,000 people.

A second plane left this afternoon - but the Ministry of Defence has been keen to stress there are no desires to enter another war.

A spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We're talking about a humanitarian mission, not a military one'.

And Britain has Special Forces in the region working with US counterparts, identifying potential targets for further air strikes aimed at stopping the advances of Islamists towards Kurdish areas or Baghdad.

Many SAS men speak Arabic and know Iraq's mountains and cities well after a decade of missions. An MoD spokesman said: 'We do not comment on the movements of Special Forces'.

Smoke rising: There were two strikes launched less than two hours apart yesterday, which targeted mortar emplacements and a convoy

Yesterday extremists captured hundreds of Yazidi women in Mosul and held them in schools while thousands of other civilians fled in fear, according to officials.

Kami Amin, a spokesman for Iraq's human rights ministry, said: 'We think that the terrorists by now consider them slaves and they have vicious plans for them.

'We think that these women are going to be used in demeaning ways by those terrorists to satisfy their animalistic urges in a way that contradicts all the human and Islamic values.'

Escorted by two Navy fighter jets this morning, three planes dropped 72 bundles of supplies for the refugees trapped in the Sinjar Mountains in northern Iraq, where they are trying to escape to Turkey.

The extremists' 'campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide,' said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. 'For anyone who needed a wake-up call, this is it.'

London calling: Britain also joined in the aid efforts in Iraq - pictured above is an RAF Hercules being loaded with drinking water and tents for the beleagured Yazidis

Locked in: An aid worker piles the packages into the Hercules - they are due to be dropped from the skies above Iraq, where as many as 50,000 are stranded

The U.S. bombing yesterday was followed up by a second round of airstrikes near Irbil, the city where officials said the artillery would have been used.

According to the U.N., more than 500,000 people have been displaced by the violence in Iraq since June, bringing the total this year to well over a million.

Expanding from their stronghold of Mosul, Islamic State have captured a string of towns and Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam and reservoir in recent weeks.

The group captured Mosul in June then launched a blitz towards the south, sweeping over Sunni-majority towns almost to the capital, Baghdad.

It already holds large parts of western Iraq and neighboring Syria, and Iraqi government forces crumbled in the face of the assault but have since been able to prevent the militants from advancing into Shiite-majority areas.

In the north, Kurdish fighters have been the main line of defense against the radicals but they are over-stretched and under-resourced.

In contrast to Washington's decision to invade Iraq more than a decade ago, both the airdrop and the authorization of military action against the Islamic State group were widely welcomed by Iraqi and Kurdish officials fearful of the militants' advance.

'We thank Barack Obama,' said Khalid Jamal Alber, from the Religious Affairs Ministry in the Kurdish government.

The International Rescue Committee said it was providing emergency medical care for up to 4,000 dehydrated Yazidis, mostly women and children, who survived without food or water for up to six days hiding in the Sinjar mountains before fleeing to a refugee camp in Syria, where a civil war is raging.

Officials in Britain, Germany and elsewhere pledged financial aid to support humanitarian efforts in Iraq, and several top European officials supported Obama's decision to intervene with airstrikes.

Missile: The Kurdish fighters are seen as the last line of defence because they are poorly-resourced to deal with the invading horde of militants

Last line of defence: Kurdish fighters (pictured) say they are willing to fight to the death to defend their homeland in northern Iraq from the Islamic State fighters
