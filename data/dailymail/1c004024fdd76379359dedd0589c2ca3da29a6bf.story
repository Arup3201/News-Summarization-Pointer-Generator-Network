The mother of French president Francois Hollande's four children has reacted angrily after her face was used to advertise an adultery website.

Segolene Royal is pictured on billboards for the Victoria Milan infidelity website alongside the slogan: 'Give your passion free rein - have an affair'.

The 60-year-old former 2007 presidential candidate is shown smiling with her skirt blowing in the wind beside a French flag to promote the site for cheating couples.

'It's a violation of the law': Segolene Royal, the ex-partner of French President Francois Hollande, has reacted furiously to this advert which uses her face to promote a pro-adultery website

Ms Royal - the president's partner for 28 years - has demanded that the company withdraw the adverts which have appeared across Paris.

She told French daily Le Figaro: 'I find the use of my likeness or my name for financial ends unacceptable.

'It's a violation of the law, and I've taken steps to demand that they withdraw the campaign.'

But Victoria Milan has refused to remove her from the controversial ad campaign - instead praising her for her 'courage'.

Demanding site withdraws campaign: Ms Royal was Mr Hollande's partner for 28 years until he left her for the current first lady Valerie Trierweiler and is also the mother of his four children

Claims: Several biographies suggested Mr Hollande and his current partner Ms Trierweiler (right) had been having an affair for years while he was with Ms Royal

Spokeswoman Aishah Vassallo, of parent company Digisecmedia, told Le Figaro: 'Segolene Royal is a modern and avant-garde person who encourages others people and public personas to be courageous.

'We think the same way as her - that is, we want to liberate people, encourage them to realise their passions, and make their lives vibrant again.

'The free woman that Segolene Royal is, was the best person to embody our vision.'

Mr Hollande and Ms Royal lived 
together for 28 years before the president left her for Val√©rie 
Trierweiler, his current partner and France's first lady.

Several biographies suggested Mr Hollande and Ms Trierweiler had been having an affair for years.

The
 instense hatred between the two women boiled over yet again earlier 
this year when Ms Royal called Ms Trierweiler 'nasty and aggressive'.

Bitter rivalry: Ms Trierweiler (left) and Ms Royal (right) have been involved in a war of words in the media on several occasions over recent years

Ms
 Trierweiler, a 48-year-old divorced glossy magazine journalist, caused 
outrage last year when she tweeted support for a rival of Ms Royal in a 
parliamentary election - one which Ms Royal went on to lose.

When asked in a TV interview to plug a new book, Ms Royal was asked if she had forgiven Ms Trierweiler.

Ms
 Royal replied: 'In life, when you are betrayed, when someone hurts you -
 what is more, gratuitously - when it's ferocious, when it's violent, if
 you want to survive you have to forgive.'At the end of the day, they hurt themselves, you know, nasty and aggressive people.'

A year ago, rival adultery website Ashley Madison used the faces of Francois Hollande and former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy in a promotional campaign.

Under an image of the men with fake lipstick superimposed on them, a tagline read: 'What do they all have in common? They should have thought of Ashley Madison.'

The slogan was a clear reference to the three men's widely reported affairs and suggested they would have stayed secret with the use of the website.
