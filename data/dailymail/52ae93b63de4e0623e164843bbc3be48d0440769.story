Hassam Khan, 24, had his front teeth broken after an NYPD cop smashed his face into the roof of a car during a traffic stop last year in Staten Island 

A 24-year-old is suing the New York Police Department after a cop allegedly smashed his face into a car roof leaving pieces of his front teeth stuck in the metal.

Hassam Khan was driving home in his cousin's new Mercedes on December 26 last year, when the pair were pulled over by an unmarked police car in Staten Island.

The cops pulled the men over because they may have been speeding, Mr Khan's lawyer told MailOnline on Wednesday.

The officers then illegally searched the car but didn't find any drugs or contraband items that they appeared to be looking for, lawyer Harvey Greenberg said. 

It was then, according to Mr Greenberg, that the cops became 'upset' and slammed his client's face into the roof of the car.

The violence of the move caused portions of the 24-year-old's front teeth to snap off and become embedded in the metal.

The alleged assault occurred in front of Mr Khan's family home in Graniteville.  

He was left in 'excruciating pain' following the incident and had to have the broken parts of his front teeth pulled out and replaced with implants.

The procedure cost Mr Khan, who does not have insurance, $1,500. 

Mr Khan, a graduate student who is working for his father's business, was charged with reckless driving, resisting arrest and obstructing government administration. 

He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after being advised by a lawyer who is a friend of the family. 

Parts of the 24-year-old graduate's front teeth were left embedded in the metal on the car roof. He is now suing the NYPD in a civil lawsuit filed on Monday

Mr Greenberg said that a civil lawsuit had been filed in Brooklyn Federal Court on Monday.

The suit alleges that Officer Mark Scarlatelli was the cop who used excessive force and slammed Mr Khan's head into the car and accused him of being drunk.

According to the Daily News, the three cops involved could be facing disciplinary action.  

The Civilian Complaint Review Board examined the officers' actions and substantiated Khan’s allegations against Scarlatelli along with agreeing that an improper search of the car had taken place by Detective Steven Marshall. 

Officer John Ryan was cited for not telling NYPD Internal Affairs  about the injuries suffered by the suspect, Mr Greenberg said.

A city official confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that the Civilian Complaint Review Board looked into Mr Khan's claims
