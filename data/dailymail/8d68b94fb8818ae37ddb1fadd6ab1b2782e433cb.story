A three-year-old Toronto boy who wandered into the bitter-cold streets of his neighborhood on his own early this morning wearing only a T-shirt, diaper and boots has been found dead.

He was staying in his grandparents' apartment when he was seen on CCTV leaving the building at 4.20am.

The boy's family woke at about 7.30am to find he was missing. They had last seen him when they put him to bed wearing a T-shirt and diaper at about 9.30pm.

Three-year-old Elijah March, from Toronto, wandered into the bitter-cold streets of his neighborhood on his own last night wearing only a T-shirt, diaper and boots. He was found this morning without vital signs

Security footage from the building shows Elijiah pushing his way through the apartment building's front door at 4.05am. 

He was last seen on camera on the apartment's driveway at 4.20am before wandering off, according to CTV News. 

At 4.20 am, the temperature in the area was -2F, and with windchill it felt more like -18F.

The boy was found with no vital signs 'tucked away in the corner' in the backyard of a home at 10.20am, Police Inspector Frank Barredo told CBC News.

He was discovered by two volunteer searchers just a few hundred yards from where his family thought he was sleeping.

He was taken to North York General Hospital in life-threatening condition and later died. 

There is no indication as to why the boy left his apartment or where he was trying to go, police said.

Mother-of-three Rachel Eizentil, who lives at the address where Elijah was found, told CBS News that she was devastated and that she hadn't heard any noise during the night. 

Barredo said more than 100 officers took part in the search for Elijah and volunteers came from all over the city to help.

The police department also set up a comment post in the area. The search included police dogs and officers on horseback.

'Certainly the community stepped up and we are thankful for it,' he told CBC News.

Toronto Mayor John Tory offered support for Elijah's family. 

'As a father and as a grandfather, you just can't imagine what that family is going through dealing with this whole thing - from beginning to wherever it ends,' he said.
