Commons Speaker John Bercow is ‘pushing hard’ to recall MPs from their summer holidays if Nelson Mandela dies this August - at a cost to taxpayers of more than £40,000.

MPs, officials and government sources say Mr Bercow is ‘bursting’ to recall Parliament to pay tribute to the former ANC leader.

But his enthusiasm for a recall - which would be unprecedented for a foreign leader - has irritated some MPs.

Bursting: Speaker John Bercow is said to be 'pushing hard' for a recall of Parliament if Nelson Mandela should die while it is in recess. The move is said to have irritated some MPs

They believe Mr Bercow is seeking ‘penitence’ for his membership, in the 1980s, of the ultra-right wing Conservative Monday Club and the Federation of Conservative students which both disparaged Mr Mandela’s fight for freedom.

The Speaker has denied claims that he once wore a t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ‘Hang Nelson Mandela’ but the shirts, and stickers, were manufactured when he was a member of the FCS, which was shut down by Tory high command in 1986 when he was chairman.

Mr Bercow was also secretary of the Monday club’s Repatriation Committee, which called for immigrants to be sent back to their country of origin.

Derek Laud said in 2011 that the Monday Club, of whom Bercow was a member, said Mandela was a 'criminal' who 'deserved' his sentence

Black Tory Derek Laud, who was a member of both the FCS and the Monday Club told the Mail in 2011: ‘According to the Monday Club, Nelson Mandela was a “criminal” and “deserved” his prison sentence. I was alone in saying the opposite and John and his cohorts told me I only felt such a thing because I was black. He was robustly in support of the apartheid regime in South Africa.’

But since the 1980s the Speaker has been on a political journey that saw him elected almost entirely by Labour MPs in 2010 and has seen him embrace a series of fashionable left-wing causes.

A senior Tory MP told the Mail: ‘Bercow is pushing hard for Parliament to be recalled if Nelson Mandela passes away during the summer recess, even though there’s no precedent for a foreign leader to be honoured in this way.

‘Many MPs think he’s pushing so hard as an act of penitence for his previous involvement in the Monday Club and allegedly wearing a “Hang Nelson Mandela” t-shirt.

‘There’s a mixed view in Parliament. Some people think Mandela deserves to be recognised and others feel it would be wrong since we haven’t done it in the past for people like the Pope or Mother Theresa. Recalls cost a lot of money too.’ The recall of Parliament in August 2011 after the riots in London and other cities cost taxpayers nearly £44,000 - but that doesn’t include the travel allowances paid to MPs in order to get home for the debate.

A briefing note compiled by the House of Commons Library shows that not one of the 26 Parliamentary recalls since 1948 has concerned the death of a foreign leader. Most have concerned wars, international crises and terrorist attacks.

The decision over whether Parliament is recalled ultimately resides with the Speaker, but he is only supposed to act after a request from ministers.

Senior government sources say David Cameron and his ministers would not want to be seen standing in the way of a session to pay tribute to Mr Mandela.

David Cameron and other colleagues are said be surprised by the degree to which Mr Bercow and his staff have pushed the issue in discussions with government whips and officials

But officials say they have been surprised by the degree to which Mr Bercow and his staff have pushed the issue in discussions with government whips and officials in Whitehall.

‘It is clear that Bercow is determined to recall Parliament. He’s bursting to do it,’ one source familiar with the discussions said.

By contrast, Mr Bercow was reported to be irritated by David Cameron’s determination to recall Parliament after the death of Lady Thatcher On that occasion, his wife Sally, a Labour supporter, refused to attend the funeral saying she did not want to join in the ‘attempted canonisation’ of the late prime minister.

A spokesman for the Speaker confirmed that discussions about a recall of Parliament have taken place and that Mr Bercow is supportive of the idea but also claimed that view was shared by ministers.

Asked if the Speaker thinks it’s a good idea, the spokesman said: ‘Yes. Obviously he thinks it’s appropriate should the request come in.

He added: ‘There have been discussions, obviously. There’s a general consensus. I don’t really think it could be accurately said he is forcing people’s hands.’ No10 source said: ‘No decisions have been taken as the situation hasn’t arisen and it easily may not do.’
