A Florida sheriff's department have launched an investigation after a deputy shot and critically injured an unarmed black man - who some witnesses say had his hands up.

Cedric Bartee, 28, was rushed to an Orlando hospital in critical but stable condition following the shooting in Orange County early on Monday.

The officer, Sergeant Robert McCarthy, has been placed on administrative duty during the investigation, which comes amid weeks of protests across the country against police violence.

'I ask everyone to not rush to judgment and allow the investigation to be completed,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a news conference in Orlando, as he promised transparency.

Shots: Cedric Bartee, left, was shot once by a police officer on Monday after he and a friend, Henry Chaney, right, were seen in a stolen police car. Chaney surrendered but Bartee would not, police said

Scene: The deputy shot three times at Bartee after the man allegedly kept on moving around inside the vehicle, pictured, which left the officer 'fearful for his life', police said

Deputies had been looking for a stolen car late on Sunday when they saw the empty vehicle - a white Honda Accord - parked outside the Timber Sound Apartments, WESH reported.

The officers approached the car, but as they neared it, Bartee and another man, 28-year-old Henry Chaney, claimed in, according to authorities.

When police ordered the two men to surrender, Chaney did, but Bartee remained inside the car and moved around, police said.

McCarthy, who is white, said he was unable to see his hands and, fearing for his life, he fired three times, hitting the man once.

No weapons were found inside the car. 

Witnesses said that Bartee did have his hands raised.

'They kept telling the boy to put their hands up,' witness Ernest Miles Jr. told WESH. 'Their hands were already up. There was no tint on the car, so you could see in the car and the police just kept saying, "Put your hands up". Before you know it, they shot three times in the car.'

Questions: But one witness, Ernest Miles Jr., said the man in the car had his hands up when police shot

Probe: Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, pictured, said an investigation is underway and promised transparency in the case. It comes after racially-charged protests broke out across the country

The conflicting accounts are reminiscent of the case of Michael Brown, who was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in August. Some witnesses said the 18-year-old black man had his hands raised at the time, but police and other witnesses have disputed that.

Last month, a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, sparking massive protests across the Missouri city and the rest of the country.

After that decision, another grand jury in Staten Island, New York said that another cop, Daniel Pantaleo, would not be charged in the chokehold death of a black man, Eric Garner, in July.  

Bartee has been arrested on 45 charges since 1999 but the deputy was not aware of his background at the time of the shooting, Demings said. 

Chaney has also been arrested 'multiple' times, police said.

McCarthy has worked for the Orange County Sheriff's Office since 2007. He has never been involved in a shooting before, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
