A minister yesterday admitted that the plan to serve free hot meals to all young children in primary schools from September was going to fail.

David Laws, the Liberal Democrat second-in-command at the Department for Education, said some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot.

He admitted not everything would be ‘perfect on day one’ as schools battle to implement Nick Clegg’s flagship plan to offer four to seven-year-olds free lunches from September.

It suggests some schools will take weeks or months, if not longer, to offer all eligible pupils hot meals. 

Mr Laws also disclosed that extra funding to help small schools implement the policy may need to continue for ‘years’.

The Mail disclosed this week that tens of thousands of pupils will be served reheated meals or cold sandwiches from September because schools lack proper kitchens and cannot afford them.

More than 3,000 primaries – about one in five – will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens.

Dozens of others will offer only cold lunches, in some cases at pupils’ desks. But many of these are unlikely to meet rules on  nutritional content that schools must follow.

Mr Law’s comments, in a speech to school caterers in Birmingham yesterday, represented the first time that the Government had admitted the scale of the problem.

David Laws said that some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot

He said: ‘Some schools will provide a cold meal initially, until capital works are complete. In the medium term we expect all schools to be giving a hot food option – which is what is really necessary to meet the school food standards consistently.’

The Liberal Democrats insisted that ‘medium term’ meant weeks but research for the Mail suggests renovation works at some schools will take considerably longer. 

Mr Laws also said that many schools were ‘raising their sights’ above transporting in pre-prepared meals and wanted their  own kitchens.

He said the Government intended to consider what it could do to ‘support schools further in creating the right facilities and environment to maximise the quality of food’.

But he added: ‘It would be unrealistic to think that in just one year we could rebuild the entire school estate and reverse decades of neglect in some areas.’  

And he insisted: ‘I was not willing to allow the search for perfection to get in the way of delivering a step change in healthy eating which is needed right now.’  

Mr Clegg used his speech to last year’s Liberal Democrat conference to demand a ‘hot, healthy lunch’ for infant school pupils every day.

Following warnings from head teachers, references to ‘hot’ were quietly dropped from legislation published earlier this year, which simply requires that food  be ‘nutritious’.

The policy has provoked one of the fiercest bouts of in-fighting within the Coalition since power-sharing began in 2010.
