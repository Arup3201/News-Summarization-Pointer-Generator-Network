Bacary Sagna was clearly enjoying life as he took some time out on the beach in Rio after sealing his move to Manchester City and helping France through to the last 16 of the World Cup.

The full-back spent the afternoon with his wife, Ludivine, and their children as the French players were given some time off after Wednesday night's goalless draw with Ecuador.

Sagna turned down offers of a contract renewal at Arsenal, but hit back at the rumours he had been trying to simply hike up his wages, pointing out that he had been on the same deal at the Emirates for the past six years

Sagna is free to join City when his contract runs out on June 30 and he said: 'I am a City player.'

But he was keen to clarify why he turned down Arsene Wenger's offers to stay at Arsenal.

'I’m going to clear everything up because I keep reading that I did it for money and I’m greedy,' he said.

'What I want to say is I have stayed with Arsenal on the same contract since 2008 and I never asked for more money.

'For people who think it’s for money, it’s not. I just wanted to change. I needed a boost in my career and I think it was about time.

'It was not an easy time because we were still involved in the FA Cup and it was hard to stay focused. I stayed focused on my team because I have a lot of respect for Arsenal.

'It’s not easy to read every day things which are wrong most of the time. I told my family to keep away from speculation and I stayed focused.'

High note: The FA Cup victory was the only trophy Sagna won during his seven-year spell at Arsenal

And although he finally won his first trophy with Arsenal when they beat Hull in the FA Cup final last month, he admits going to join Manuel Pellegrini will give him the chance of Premier League and Champions League glory.

'It is an exciting time for me and my career. I think we have a good team with City and we can do great things.

'Arsenal made me grow up as a player and as a man as well. We finally won a trophy, but it’s not even about that because Arsenal have a quality.

'It’s just that, personally, I wanted a boost. I needed to start again.'
