Barcelona star Neymar might not have been involved in his side's match with Rayo Vallecano, but that didn't mean he was any less delighted when they scored. 

The 23-year-old Brazil captain, who is currently serving a suspension for picking up too many yellow cards in La Liga, took to Instagram to reveal a video of him celebrating after Luis Suarez had given Barca a 1-0 lead at the Nou Camp. 

Neymar himself has been in superb form for his club this season, scoring 26 goals in 34 appearances so far.
