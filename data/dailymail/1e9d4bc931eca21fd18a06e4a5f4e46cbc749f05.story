Ever wondered how condoms are made? Or, most of all, how they're tested? Well, wonder no more.

You shall soon be able to see for yourself, when one condom manufacturer opens its factory doors and becomes the world's first condom museum.

The only catch is that you'll have to travel all the way to Taiwan to see it, at Taiwan Fuji Latex, Taiwan's biggest condom manufacturer.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

One size fits all: The condom factory in Taipei is opening its doors to educate visitors about sexual health

Testing the product: Fuji Latex, which was founded by You Chi-cheng in 1972 in Taipei's Tamsui district, will open the world's first condom factory to tourists on 22 August

Fuji Latex, which was founded by You Chi-cheng in 1972 in Taipei's Tamsui district, will open the world's first condom factory to tourists on 22 August, allowing visitors to see how the contraceptive is made, tested and packaged.

Visitors to the new 'museum' - which is being enabled by the New Taipei city government - will also be able to play games, attend tutorials, blow up condoms like balloons and watch videos related to condoms, according to China Times' English language sister website Want China Times.

Visitors will be taught the 
history of prophylactic devices, learn 
about the latest safe sex tips, view various special exhibitions and even take part in an interactive DIY station for trying on a 
condom and 'other simulations', according to the Taipei Times.

You founded the factory in cooperation with Japan's Fuji Latex, initially supplying contraceptives to developing countries such as India and Africa through the World Health Organization and Red Cross.

Pop! A factory worker demonstrates how condom durability is tested by being blown to the size of a person to see when it explodes

But he was initially vague about what exactly he was producing, saying simply that he worked in 'the medical industry'.

Despite the number of people infected with HIV in the country rising rapidly - one person is now diagnosed every four hours - sex is still relatively taboo in Taiwan.

You and Fuji Latex vice president Chang 
Wen-chuan  feel the most effective way to combat this problem and encourage people to use contraception is to provide better sex education.
