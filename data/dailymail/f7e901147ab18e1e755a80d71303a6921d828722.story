The family of Oscar Pistorius has 
said it is 'deeply disturbed' by their son's Twitter support group attacking 
the memory of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp who he shot and killed on Valentine's Day.

The statement issued today said: 'The
disregard that is being shown by some - specifically those commenting 
via social media - for the profound pain that Reeva's family and friends
are going through is very troubling'

The statement came in response to the establishment of a group on 
Twitter who tweet their support for Oscar Pistorius and believe in his 
innocence under the hashtag #Pistorians.

The Pistorius support group is reportedly unofficially led by a UK woman called Laura Lambden, who tweets under the name Tyger-Lill. Pistorius's family has said group 'disregards' pain felt by Steenkamp's relatives

Members have vowed to stand by Pistorius throughout his trial and tweet support for the athlete under the hashtag #Pistorians

The group -  which is reportedly 
unofficially led by a woman from the UK called Laura Lambden  - includes
supporters in South Africa, Germany, and the island of Borneo.

One tweet read: 'If you want to label
me a #Pistorian because I say 'why are there so many tributes to Reeva 
when many women have died since her' so be it!'

Another, which was later removed, 
appeared to criticise Miss Steenkamp for posing in a bikini: 'Errr like 
she was a bikini model. 'Sex sells'!!! I would be really upset if my 
daughter posed like that.'

The group was mobilised just days after he was arrested and includes post of semi naked images of the athlete - who they refer to as OP - under the hashtag #OscarPorn.

The family statement went on to offer an indication 
that Pistorius is becoming more active while awaiting trial on a murder 
charge by saying that he had been spending time with people close to Steenkamp.

'Over the past few weeks, Oscar has 
found comfort in spending time and sharing memories with many of those 
whom she loved, in surroundings where shared memories were created,' the statement said.

The women, who all themselves the #Pistorians, aim to defend the reputation of their hero - who is currently charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (right)

It did not identify the people with whom 26-year-old Pistorius had met, nor the locations.

Anneliese
Burgess, a spokeswoman for the Pistorius family, said the athlete had 
been 'very isolated' but had begun a process of 'interacting with 
people.'

The double-amputee athlete has been 
staying at the Pretoria home of his uncle, Arnold, since he was released
on bail in late February, and he has largely remained out of public 
view amid intense international interest in his case.

The
family of Pistorius has stated that the runner was traumatised and in 
mourning over what he said was the mistaken shooting of girlfriend Reeva
Steenkamp, but relatives and associates have increasingly signaled that
Pistorius is emerging from what a spokeswoman described as isolation.

'There
is not a moment in the day that Oscar does not mourn for his girlfriend
and Reeva's family, and all those who were close to her are in his 
thoughts constantly,' the statement said.

Miss Steenkamp was 
shot after she locked herself in his bathroom in the early hours of 
Valentine’s Day. Pistorius claims he mistook her for an intruder.

Pistorius said
the killing of Steenkamp was an accident, and that he thought he was 
firing at an intruder through a bathroom door at his home. Prosecutors 
say he shot her after the couple had an argument.

The
runner's agent, Peet van Zyl, has said Pistorius was running on his 
blades again and his return to regular training was imminent. Last week,
a grainy cellphone photo of what appears to be Pistorius on the track 
at the University of Pretoria was published on the front page of the 
Afrikaans-language Beeld newspaper in South Africa.

Pistorius is scheduled to be back in court on June 4. He could face a life sentence if found guilty of murder.
