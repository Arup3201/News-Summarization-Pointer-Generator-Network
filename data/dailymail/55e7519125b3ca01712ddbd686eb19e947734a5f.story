Ghana’s plans for this evening’s decisive World Cup clash against Portugal have been catapulted into chaos after two players – Sulley Muntari and Kevin Prince Boateng – were suspended indefinitely and ordered home.

The Ghanaian FA claim that a team meeting descended into acrimony on Tuesday when Muntari launched ‘an unprovoked physical attack on Moses Armah, an Executive Committee member from the national association.

A statement released by the Ghana FA on Thursday afternoon read: ‘The Ghana Football Association (GFA) has suspended Sulley Ali Muntari indefinitely from the Black Stars with immediate effect.

The decision was taken in the wake of his unprovoked physical attack on an Executive Committee member of the GFA and a management member of the Black Stars, Mr. Moses Armah on Tuesday 24th June, 2014 during a meeting.

‘Muntari’s accreditation for the 2014 World Cup has been withdrawn with immediate effect.’

Ghana face Portugal in Brasilia this evening and they must win to stand a chance of progressing into the knockout stages, after earning only one point from the first two group games. Muntari was suspended already for the game after collecting a yellow card in both of Ghana’s first two games.

Meanwhile, former Spurs and Portsmouth attacking midfielder Boateng has been booted out of the squad after a furious showdown with coach Kwesi Appiah, in which it is alleged that the Schalke playmaker launched a ‘vulgar’ verbal tirade at his manager.

‘The Ghana Football Association (GFA) has approved coach Kwesi Appiah’s decision to suspend Kevin-Prince Boateng indefinitely from the Black Stars,’ added the governing body in a second statement.
