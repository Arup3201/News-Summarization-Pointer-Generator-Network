Julian Assange said that the ‘door is open’ for talks to break the deadlock over his campaign to avoid extradition to Sweden as he addressed supporters and media from a balcony last night.

The WikiLeaks founder made a rare public appearance at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to mark the six-month anniversary of his sudden arrival at the building in June

The Australian has since been granted political asylum in Ecuador but has remained inside the embassy as he will be arrested if he steps outside over breaking his bail conditions.

Rare appearance: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange addressing media and supporters on a balcony at the Ecuadorian Embassy last night

Last night, Mr Assange thanked his supporters, who stood in the street outside, some carrying lighted candles.

He said: ‘Six months ago I entered this building. It has become my home, my office and my refuge.

‘Thanks to the principled stance of the Ecuadorian government and the support of its people, I am safe in this embassy and safe to speak from this embassy.’

He said he had been sustained by the solidarity of his supporters and people around the world supporting WikiLeaks and freedom of the press.

‘While my freedom is limited, I am still able to work and communicate, unlike the 232 journalists who are in jail tonight.’

Mr Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over allegations of sexual assault, which he denies.

He fears being sent to the United States to be questioned over his whistle-blowing website.

He said tonight that the Pentagon claimed recently that the existence of WikiLeaks was an ‘ongoing crime’.

The Australian continued: 'While that remains the case and while my government will not defend the journalism and publishing of WikiLeaks, I must remain here.

‘However, the door is open, and the door has always been open, for anyone who wishes to use standard procedures to speak to me or guarantee my safe passage.'

There was an added police presence outside the embassy and TV crews from  across the world filmed his speech.

Wikileaks supporters outside the Ecuadorian Embassy last night were calling for Assange to be freed, believing his extradition to Sweden would lead to him being handed over to the U.S.

Some of Mr Assange’s friends and supporters listened to his speech from inside the embassy, which had a Christmas tree in the reception area and many cards dotted around.

Mr Assange made special mention of Bradley Manning, the American soldier arrested over the leaking of military information.

He said he wanted to salute reporters and publications which had covered arrests around the world of journalists and others.

‘It is from the revelation of the truth that all else follows. Our buildings can only be as tall as their bricks are strong.

‘And our civilisation is only as strong as its ideas are true. When our buildings are erected by the corrupt, when their cement is cut with dirt, when pristine steel is replaced by scrap, our buildings are not safe to live in.’

Mr Assange said WikiLeaks was under a continuing criminal investigation, but 2012 had been a 'huge year' for the organisation.
