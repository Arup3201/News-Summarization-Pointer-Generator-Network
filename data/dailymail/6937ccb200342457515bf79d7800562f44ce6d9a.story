A man whose wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer two days ago made a dramatic public protest against bosses at a scandal-hit  hospital yesterday.

Gary Brigden’s voice shook as he claimed that delays in treating his wife Lisa at Colchester Hospital may have condemned her to death.

He stood up at a public meeting at  the hospital to lambast executives for  not tackling problems with cancer waiting times sooner.

Mr Brigden told how his 46-year-old wife had been diagnosed with inoperable stomach cancer the previous day, after a catalogue of delays and misdiagnosis. He said later: ‘I am going to lose my childhood sweetheart. I wanted to grow old with my wife.’

Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust was placed in special measures yesterday by the health sector regulator Monitor following a damning report by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

The CQC found the records of 22 cancer patients, out of a sample of 61, had been altered to disguise the ‘extensive’ delays for treatment, which in some cases could have put their lives at risk. Police are now looking into claims that staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to alter the waiting times in a bid to meet national targets.

During a heated meeting with Trust board members yesterday, angry relatives shared deeply personal stories about their loved ones who had passed away or were still fighting cancer, who they said had endured unacceptable delays in diagnosis or treatment.

Mr Brigden said his wife had been 
diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2008, after it was initially 
dismissed by the hospital as ‘fatty tissue’. The grandmother of one was 
successfully treated, but she began to feel unwell again last November 
and – three months after her first consultation – was diagnosed with 
secondary breast cancer.

Construction
worker Mr Brigden, of Manningtree, Essex, said: ‘She had chemotherapy 
and it seemed to be working, but then she started to get acid reflux. 
She kept saying I know something is not right, but there were delays in 
their response and action was not taken.

‘We had to wait long periods between scans and appointments.

‘Yesterday
they finally confirmed she had stomach cancer. It is too late though, 
it is terminal. The delays in her treatment may have cost Lisa her 
life.’

He questioned why the Trust had failed fully to investigate claims that cancer waiting times were being altered when whistleblowers first alerted managers to the problem at the start of last year.

He said: ‘I want to know if this affected Lisa. I want to know why didn’t they finish their inquiry into it in 2012. One or two people may have already lost their lives since then. They were playing with people’s lives by ignoring it.’

Yesterday, the Trust’s chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts said it was ‘deeply regrettable’ that they did not act sooner. He added: ‘It did not seem to be as serious at the time as it was. That is a deep regret.’ Government standards state the first phase of cancer treatment should be completed within 62 days, but the CQC found some of the patients whose records had been changed had waited more than 100 days. One patient waited 126 days.

Occupational health therapist Anna Barnes said yesterday that doctors ‘wrote off’ her sister and delayed her chemotherapy until it was too late.

Care manager Irene Moules, 52, of Clacton-on-Sea, died from pancreatic cancer two months ago, leaving behind her husband, two children and year-old grandson Harry.

Speaking after the meeting, Mrs Barnes said: ‘My sister had a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer and when she was diagnosed she was told it was terminal.

‘She was offered chemotherapy to prolong her life. She just wanted to meet her second grandchild, and her daughter was expecting her first child. She is due in February.

‘The delays were terrible. Several weeks would pass and you wouldn’t hear anything. She was given a date for a CT scan for five weeks away but I had to argue with them and tell them she didn’t have that long.

‘By the time she was about to have her chemotherapy, she was too weak and they never gave it to her. She felt they didn’t care. The doctors knew she was terminal so they didn’t want to bother with the chemo.’

She added: ‘I believe there is a great deal of emphasis on meeting targets at the cost of patient experience.’

A woman, who gave her name as Anna at the meeting, told hospital bosses how her 73-year-old grandmother has only weeks to live because of delays to her treatment.

Her grandmother was diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in June and had been told she had a good prognosis if she received immediate radiotherapy. But Anna said it was delayed twice and when her grandmother finally started the radiotherapy, she was told the cancer had spread to her lungs and they could only give her palliative care. An independent review has now been launched.

Dr Sally Irvine, chairman of the Trust board, said: ‘On behalf of the board, we deeply regret and apologise for the distress and concern that the contents of the CQC report have caused for patients and their families.’

Under special measures an improvement director will be appointed by Monitor to ensure the trust turns itself around.
