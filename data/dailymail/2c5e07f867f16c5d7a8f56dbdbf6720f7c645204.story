The terrifying moment two hooded thugs tried to batter down the door of a retired software engineer as he clung to the door handle to stop them breaking in has been captured on CCTV.

Simon Barnsley, was awoken by a noise outside his Â£165,000 semi-detached home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire at 1am on a night last month.

The 58-year-old then went to check his CCTV monitor to see what was happening and was stunned to see two trespassers lurking outside his property, trying to break into the basement.

The two hooded men tried to batter down Simon Barnsley's front door by violently kicking and punching it

The two men tried to break down Mr Barnsley's front door as he held the handle to prevent them from getting in

He ran to the door completely naked and jingling his car keys, thinking the men would be scared off.

But the chilling footage shows the yobs then try to break down the front door as Mr Barnsley held on to the handle, as his shocked wife Julia, 58, looked on in horror.

He battled to keep the men out as they violently kicked and punched the front door causing it to splinter and glass to smash over their front hallway in an incident lasting nine minutes.

The couple pleaded with them to leave during the ordeal while at the same time dialling 999 and eventually the pair walk off.

West Mercia Police are now hunting the yobs who struck at the house, which sits by the bank of the River Severn in the Castlfields area of the picturesque town.

Yesterday Mr Barnsley, who retired from London for a quieter life in the countryside in 2007 said the incident was a prime of example of Broken Britain.

Mr Barnsley was first alerted to the trespassers outside his home when he was awoken by a noise

The retired software engineer went to check his CCTV cameras, which showed the two men attempting to break into his property

Describing the moment he fought to keep out the intruders, Mr Barnsley - who is the son of author Gabriel Fieldings and brother of famous mathematician Michael Barnsley - said: 'It was pretty brutal.

'I have never seen anything like this happen.

'This area has really deteriorated over the last year. I think people have tried to burgle us three or four times in the last year.

'About a year ago thieves broke in and stole a PlayStation and lots of gadgets and laptops and things, and that's when I decided to get the CCTV installed.

'It was quite terrifying and it all happened while I was completely naked.

'I was holding the handle and leaning on the door with my full weight but they were still breaking though.

'I told them I was recording them and you would think they would leave after that but they just got more irate.

Mr Barnsley, right and his wife Julia, pictured outside their home had to fight to keep out the intruders while they waited for the police to arrive

'We were so frightened and every time I moved away from the door a little bit it squeaked so I thought they were still there so I ended up hard against the door until the police arrived.

'At one point they left and then came back and picked up a little black canister which I think was pepper spray.

'I think they were wanting to break through the door, pepper spray my wife and I, then just rob the place anyway.

'I was OK because I'm quite fit for my age, but if it had just been my wife in it could have been so much worse.

'This area is nice during the day with mums and pushchairs, you hear a lot of laughing.

But it's a different place after dark. It's changed my view of humanity.'

The 58-year-old was forced to hold on the door handle of the front door, pictured, to stop the men from breaking in

The footage shows the men at first loitering outside the property and talking on their phones.

Several times they come to the house and then walk away again - clearly showing their faces to the camera.

After a while they return and open the gate at the basement of the house before repeatedly kicking the door.

In the footage, after his wife says 'call the police Si' defiant Mr Barnsley can be heard calmly saying: 'I'm recording it. I want to catch his voice as well as his face.

Before he adds: 'I'm recording you on a camera and I'm recording you doing what you're doing at the door and I'm going to report you to the police.'

The thug then replies: 'You f***ing, f***ing idiot.'

The force of which the men tried to batter down the front door caused the door to splinter and caused glass to smash all over their hallway

But Mrs Barnsley, who used to teach for the Open University, said the incident would not scare them away from the area.

She added: 'We were petrified. The whole incident was terrifying. But we will not allow them to drive us out of this house.

'We moved here from Croydon, when we semi-retired and it is paradise. The CCTV does reassure me and we love living here. They will not make us leave.'

A spokeswoman for West Mercia Police said that police were trying to identify the men, described as wearing light coloured jackets, one wearing trousers and trainers, the other wearing shorts.

She added: 'We are studying the CCTV images and want anyone with any information to get in touch.'
