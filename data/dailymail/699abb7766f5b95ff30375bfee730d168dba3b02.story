A teenager severely burned in a house fire which killed her father has said she has forgiven her stepmother who deliberately starting the blaze.

Josefina Vilela was lost both of her legs below the knee and part of her left arm after the fire at her home in Walsall, West Midlands in 2011.

The blaze - which left Josefina with 60 per cent burns and killed her father Carlos - was started by her stepmother, Georgina Vilela, who has since been jailed for murder.

Josefina, who was just 14 years old when the fire took place, spent 18 months in hospital and has since learned to walk again using two prosthetic legs.

But despite the horrific events which tore the teenager's life apart, she told this week how she has now forgiven her father's killer.

Josefina Vilela had both legs amputated at the knee and lost part of her left arm following an arson attack by her stepmother on her West Midlands home in 2011

Josefina, now 17, said: 'Although she took a very special person away from me, my dad, I don't want to lose a second's happiness by hating her.

'I feel sorry for her. She destroyed her own life, I've moved on with mine. I hold no grudge against her. She has claimed the life of a man who was dearest to me but I forgive her.

'She has lost everything including her freedom and her family but I have the love of my sisters and that is all that matters.

'I don't really think about the negative side of what has happened to me. I am so glad to be alive and I just channel everything into the positive.'

Stepmother Georgina is currently serving a minimum 23-year jail term for murder and arson with intent to endanger life.

She poured petrol over Carlos as he lay in bed and the resulting fire quickly engulfed the house where then-14-year-old Josefina and her three sisters were asleep.

Josefina told how of her forgiveness on the day she was reunited with the fire crew who saved her from the burning building.

The inspirational teenager wept as she was given a bouquet of flowers by firefighters at Walsall Fire Station earlier this week during a visit organised by sisters, Maise, 24, and Carina, 16.

She said: 'I've been wanting to meet these men ever since the night of the fire to tell them how amazing they are. They saved my life. They are my heroes.'

Firefighter 
Rob Hamer, who was one of the team who brought the teenager out of the 
house, said: 'It was one of the worst house fires I've been to.

'Josefina
 was wrapped in a duvet when we found her, you couldn't tell how bad her
 burns were at the time. Our main priority was to get her breathing 
again. She's made a fantastic recovery.'

His
 colleague Carl Warburton added: 'We never get people coming back to 
thank us so this has been a bit overwhelming for us too.'

Josefina says she now hopes to compete in the Paralympic Games in either swimming or track and field.

She said: 'I have become an ambassador for sports for young people and want to show people that, no matter what happens to you in life, you can go on and achieve things and live life to the full.'

In court two years ago, her HIV-positive stepmother, Georgina Vilela, was described as a wife with a terrible 'temper'.

The court heard she had suffered from depression and felt 'like an incomplete woman' as a result of not being able to bear her husband children.

Josefina's three sisters escaped the building with less serious injuries.
