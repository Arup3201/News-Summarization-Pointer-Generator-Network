It may be too soon to give up the day job, but Wayne Rooney took to the stage at Manchester United's Christmas party to give everyone a taste of his singing voice.

The England captain posted an Instagram picture of himself belting out a song with the house band while his teammates enjoyed a festive evening out at The Place in Manchester on Wednesday.

Rooney, a known fan of artists including Ed Sheeran and the Stereophonics, had a concentrated expression on his face while clicking his fingers by his side - and accompanied the picture with the caption: 'My turn to do a song at the @manchesterunited Christmas party!'

In another post from the evening, Rooney is pictured possibly enjoying another player's efforts from the dance floor as his wife Coleen and players including Darren Fletcher and Ashley Young laugh in the background.

After a dire start to their season under Louis van Gaal, few would have expected to see the United players smiling so brightly come December.

But here they are, after four consecutive Premier League wins, grinning from ear to ear with something to celebrate at their annual Christmas Party.

Striker Robin van Persie donned a big curly-haired wig, seemingly mocking his team-mate Marouane Fellaini, in a happy snap with the Belgium midfielder and back-up keeper Anders Lindegaard.

Lindegaard and Fellaini were 'looking after' 19-year-old Adnan Januzaj at the dinner

The Place is a Grade II listed building which was a former railway warehouse built back in 1867. 

In 1998 it was transformed into The Place Aparthotel but kept many of the key features.

The most expensive bottle of wine on the menu is Chateauneuf du Pape at £35.95 and a bottle of Champagne Pol Roger will set you back £165

'Great xmas dinner with the boys!' Van Persie posted on Instagram. 

The players and their partners enjoyed a night of live music, singing and a disco until the early hours of Thursday morning.

Lindegaard was also confident teen star Adnan Januzaj was in good hands with himself and Fellaini 'looking after' the 19-year-old as they celebrated their season's turnaround in form. 

Meanwhile, Radamel Falcao and his wife Lorelei Taron were beaming as they await the arrival of their first baby. Also at the party, among others, were Chris Smalling and his partner, ex-page three girl Sam Cooke, Daley Blind and girlfriend Candy-Rae Fleur and Phil Jones and girlfriend Kaya Hall.

As the players and their partners headed home from the night out, the women clutched goodie bags from cosmetic company Jo Malone.

United started the season with a home defeat against Burnley before draws against Sunderland and Burnley, either side of an embarrassing defeat by League One MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

But now, while not totally convincing, United have overcome Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Hull and  Stoke on Tuesday night in their last four games and are now fourth in the Premier League table. 

A Southampton side coming off the back off back-to-back defeats by Manchester City and Arsenal await United on Monday before games against Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham over the festive period.
