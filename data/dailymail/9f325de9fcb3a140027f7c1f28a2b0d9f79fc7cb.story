A security guard who carried out a 'bone crushing' tackle on a streaker during a rugby Test match in New Zealand on Saturday has been criticised for being overly aggressive.

The male streaker ran onto the pitch in the second half of the Test between the All Blacks and England at Dunedin's Forsyth Barr Stadium.

But he was quickly taken out by a security guard who lunged through the air and tackled him to the ground from behind.

The streaker's head snapped back as he was crash tackled, before he was placed in a headlock and dragged from the pitch with the help of two other security guards.

Footage of the tackle has since gone viral with more than 180,000 views on YouTube.

Sports website, fansided.com, described the crash tackle as 'bone crushing'.

'We're not talking some small hit here or even a grab around the neck in effort to send the nude fan to the ground. We're talking a full on, two-footed launch from three feet out that would make hard hitting NFL Pro Bowl talent blush.

'I mean seriously - look at (the) dude's neck jerk back. He's lucky it stayed attached to his head.'

Many online viewers have condemned the security guard for being too aggressive, with the crash tackle being described as 'unnecessary' and 'mental'.

But others suggested he should have been given a professional rugby contract.

It believed the security guard does play rugby but as part of a training squad in a national competition in Canterbury's ITM Cup, stuff.co.nz reports.

Head coach Scott Robertson was hesitant to answer when asked if the guard was part of his squad.

The All Black went on to win the match 28-27.
