The brand new Indian Super League begins next month - and bosses hope it will rival cricket's Indian Premier League for the public's attention.

They're calling it 'football on steroids' and the 10-week league is all but ready for kick-off on October 12.

Pires, who has not played professional football since leaving Aston Villa in 2011, will play for Goa in the competition.
