A missing 13-year-old girl from Pennsylvania has been found at a bus station in Washington D.C. with a 20-year-old man she met online.

Savanna Marie MacMullett was last seen by her parents at 4pm on Monday when she told them she was heading out for an after-school activity. They reported her missing on Tuesday.

Just hours later, she was tracked down in Washington D.C. with Ashley Ryan Hareford, 20, after her parents had told police she might have run off with him.

Authorities also received an anonymous tip that
the pair were seen boarding a Megabus to Washington D.C. and, when they
arrived at their destination at 7pm, U.S. Marshals were waiting.

The MacMulletts had discovered her friendship with Hareford, from Grottoes, Virginia, after they saw him lurking outside their home in Radnor, Pennsylvania on Sunday night.

After alerting police, who did not arrest Hareford, the concerned parents learned from their daughter that she knew the man and that he had hitchhiked 280 miles to see her, the Delco Times reported.

Hareford was arrested in D.C. without incident and is facing a charge of corruption of minors.

Detectives from Radnor headed to the city on Tuesday night to interview him and to bring MacMullett home. She is now being evaluated for 'any medical or mental issues'.

Relationship: Savanna had met Hareford, pictured, online and they shared public posts on Facebook

Grooming: Hareford had an 'interesting' history of looking for girls online, police said. In a photograph he uploaded to Facebook on December 1, right, he is seen kissing an unidentified girl

'Our top priority is to make sure she is
on good medical and psychological condition,' Radnor Police Lt. 
Christopher Flanagan said at a Tuesday night press conference.

Flanagan said that Hareford has a history of trying to pick up girls online, so he has 'significant concerns about his intentions'.

Authorities indicate more serious charges will be filed against Hareford, the Delco Times reported.

'I was so glad,' Savanna's great aunt Mary DeWees told WPVI after the girl was found. 'I couldn't believe it. 
It was just so scary knowing she was missing and it's just amazing that 
they found her.'

Her father, Thomas MacMullett, also expressed his relief. He had previously told reporters he was 'very scared' for his daughter's safety and found Harefordâ€™s interest in a 13-year-old girl 'disgusting'.

'Obsessed': Ashley Hareford dedicated numerous posts to Savanna MacMullett on his Facebook page

Outspoken: On another Facebook page apparently belonging to Hareford, he writes: 'I love you baby'

He added that he was shocked she had run off - as her sister, then 14, had done the same with a 28-year-old man in New Jersey. He later returned the girl.

'[Savanna] was so mad at her sister for doing it and I just can't believe she did the same,' he told reporters at a press conference earlier this week.

He said that Savanna and Hareford communicated publicly on a Facebook page he had set up.

'It seems like it's just him and her on 
that Facebook page,' he said. 'It's 
almost like a memorial dedicated specifically to the two of them. It's 
kind of creepy.'

The couple are vocal about their relationship on Facebook, with Hareford dedicating many posts to MacMullett on the page.

Anger: her father, Thomas MacMullett, called Hareford's interest in a 13-year-old girl 'disgusting'

One reads: 'I have 3 sides: 1.) The quiet, sweet side. 2. The fun and crazy side. 3. The side you never want to see', adding: 'So true!!! Savanna Marie u know this for a fact.'

He has used social media before to try
to meet girls; on DateHookup.com, Hareford said he's a guy 
looking for a 'bi emo girl or sexy straight country girl', the Philadelphia Daily News reported.

His social networking pages list his interests as raves and drugs, and claim he is 'married'. He also writes he attended the 'The Juggalo University of Murder' - a reference to the band, Insane Clown Posse, whose fans call themselves Juggalos.
