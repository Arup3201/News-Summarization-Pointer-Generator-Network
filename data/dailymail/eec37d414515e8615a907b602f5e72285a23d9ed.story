Now it’s not often that I can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend. But a few weeks ago I was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing — apparently, the must-have fabric this season, as we experience a Seventies revival.

As someone who remembers the Seventies all too clearly, and who boldly wore some of its more questionable offerings the first time round, I was interested to see how I felt about it now.

I didn’t know I was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided Britain’s women, who, it seems, all have an opinion on that skirt, as it is now known.

Jane Asher (pictured) was recently invited to a photoshoot to give her verdict on a new range of suede clothing, what she didn't realise was that the skirt she is pictured wearing would cause such a sensation

For the few who haven’t heard, I’m talking about the Marks & Spencer A-line suede skirt, which has been labelled: ‘The Skirt That Will Save M&S.’

Yet when I spotted it a few weeks ago, it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail, so I had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way. And . . . I didn’t much like it.

I found the suede stiff and heavy, and the colour and shape channelled the Seventies cowgirl look a little too closely for comfort. Some fashions are best left unrevisited and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them.

Soon after that, all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt.

It was photographed on the lithe and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me — first Alexa Chung, then socialite Olivia Palermo at New York Fashion Week, both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it.

Vogue heralded it ‘pure Ali MacGraw chic’ in reference to the star of the Seventies film Love Story, and suddenly it was the next big thing.

Well, I can be as easily influenced as anyone, and a horrible guilt crept over me that I hadn’t spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had. I wondered: should I rush out and grab one from M&S? Well, not much point, as it won’t be on sale to us ordinary punters until April 10. So, should I trust my first feeling that it wasn’t for me?

After a bit of thought, I came full circle back to my original decision: I’m still not a fan.

Yesterday, Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine was one of the first to shout ‘Emperor’s New Clothes!’ when she criticised M&S for its aggressive marketing of the skirt, which, she felt — correctly in my view — seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that doesn’t follow any trend.

‘Just because a couple of Voguettes have given it their stamp of approval, we loyal M&S customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one, too,’ she said. ‘Can’t M&S see how patronising this is?’

For this suede skirt didn’t work in the Seventies and it doesn’t really work now. When I was young, most suede skirts and jackets were stiff, unyielding garments produced in a gingery tan colour that didn’t flatter anyone — especially those of us with gingery, tan-coloured hair — and it often felt like wearing thick cardboard.

Sadly, this reincarnation gave me flashbacks. The unsuppleness and heavy feel of the suede may mean it will last for ages, but you’ll know about it while you’re wearing it: the waistband is far from forgiving and I can’t imagine it will give much across the hips when you sit down, making it stick out unattractively in front. I’m not crazy about the mid-calf length, either. Unless you have the endless legs of a model, it’s hard to carry off.

It would look better with boots, of course, but with spring already here I’m hoping those can be left in the wardrobe. And I can’t see how the white stitching on hips and tummy can be flattering.

Sorry, M&S, I’m giving it just three out of five: wearable for a few outings, after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe, never to be worn again.

A costly foray into a brief trend — something that, at my age, I have mostly learned to avoid.

UPDATED CLASSIC

Jane (pictured) loved this flattering suede dress from H&M, finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting, without the stiffness of some other suede garments

Bangle, £39, reiss.com

Button diamond ring, £210, monicavinader.com

My favourite: It’s an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour, which suits most skin tones. The suede is wonderfully supple and comfortable and fits well.

It certainly doesn’t have the stiffness that some other suede garments have, and the just-above-the-knee length is elegant and suits the shape of the dress.

Who would have thought I’d want to be back in a wrap dress again? I thought we were over those for some time. The fabric updates this classic look. I love it — especially the great price. 5/5

SHOULD YOU FAKE IT?

The suede culottes Jane is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5

No! No! No! Culottes tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they’re made in a fluid fabric. These certainly don’t suit me, and I’m proving that here beyond any reasonable doubt. They cut off my legs at the least flattering part, the calves, and look more Dickensian urchin than fashion-forward fabulous. The faux fabric does feel like the real thing, but I suspect that it might crease.

If I wanted some suede trousers I’d save up for a better design. 2/5

COMFY AND CHIC

Jane (pictured) says this suede top may be worth the £249 you'd have to shell out to buy it. She found the item 'extremely chic and wearable', saying it would work with tight jeans or a smart skirt

Deceptively simple, this little suede top just might be a really good investment as it’s extremely chic and wearable, whether teamed with tight Brand jeans or a smart skirt.

I love the boxy on-trend cut and the sleeve length makes it suitable for any occasion, as well as being long enough to keep the spring chill off and hide any imperfections. This suede is so thin and soft it feels like silk, and I like the tunic slit at the top. 4/5

MAKE A SPLASH

Another top scorer was this lilac suede dress. Jane (pictured) says it fits beautifully, skimming fluidly over the body, with the colour adding to the classy look

This fits so beautifully and skims fluidly over the body. Yes, it costs a lot, but it really does look expensive and the lilac is stunning and classy. The suede has an almost silky feel. I adored wearing this, but the danger of ruining it with smudges would make me wary of splashing out the serious cash.

Remember that suede needs a lot more care than leather, tending to show rain spots and stains easily, and the soft top layer can wear off after a lot of use. It may be worth protecting expensive suede garments with a special spray, and they will also need expert cleaning. 4/5
