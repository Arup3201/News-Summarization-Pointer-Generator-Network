A British shop manager has drowned in a desperate attempt to rescue his seven-year-old son from rough seas in Majorca.

George Selby, 27, leapt into the water despite being unable to swim after his son Louis was swept off a rocky outcrop by a huge wave.

Both died as the rest of their family watched from the shore of the Spanish island at about 11am on Saturday, during the first full day of their ‘dream’ first foreign holiday.

Louis was standing on a 55-step stone 
stairway cut into rocks overlooking a small deserted cove when he was 
hit by the large wave.

One report claimed that moments 
before, Mr Selby had been taking photographs of his son by the rocks, a 
popular spot for holidaymakers to take dramatic snapshots with waves 
crashing in the background.

After Mr Selby jumped in, Louis’s 
mother Abigail, 31, ran to a nearby hotel screaming for help. Lifeguards
from the hotel ran to the scene but were unable to save father or son.

Witnesses said they saw Mr Selby shouting for help and waving his arms in the air while in the sea.

Police officers and paramedics arrived minutes later but by then the pair, from Hornchurch, Essex, were already dead.

Manuel Gordini, 23, witnessed the drama from the beach, where he works as a chef in a bar.

He said: ‘It was horrific, the worst 
thing I’ve ever seen. The lifeguards managed to get the bodies on to the
beach but it was obvious they were already dead.

‘The mother was hysterical, crying. It was very upsetting. It was raining so there was almost nobody on the beach at the time.’

The sea conditions on the day at Cala 
Antena, a series of coves on Majorca’s south-east coast, had been poor, 
with a red flag flying on the beach warning bathers not to enter the 
sea.

Last night a police source on the 
island said: ‘It is a terrible tragedy. It appears the young boy was 
swept from the rocks by a large wave, and the dad naturally dived in to 
try to save him.

‘The sea was ferocious with very 
strong waves crashing on to the rocks. When it’s like that those stairs 
are extremely dangerous. The staircase really should be closed off when 
the weather is like that.’

Yesterday Mr Selby’s best friend, 
banker Graham Klerks, 31, said: ‘George going out into the sea to rescue
Louis is him down to a tee. The tragic thing is that George could not 
swim but I honestly can’t imagine him standing by the side and watching 
his son drown. For whatever reason he had never learned to swim. It’s so
tragic. You could not ask for a more decent guy than George.

‘He had been stressing about going abroad for the first time.

‘It was very much their dream holiday – they normally went away to Clacton-on-Sea. This was their holiday of a lifetime.’

Tragic: The Foreign Office confirmed the deaths of the two Britons

Mrs Selby’s older sons from a previous
relationship, Mitchell, 14, and Dylan, 12, were also on the family 
holiday, along with her niece Olivia, ten.

Mrs Selby, a barmaid, was yesterday being treated for shock, and family members have flown out to lend their support.

Mr Klerks added: ‘Abigail is holding it together for the kids as best she can but it must be incredibly hard right now.

‘George loved all three of his boys so much. He and Louis were alike in so many ways.

‘He was also very kind and generous. The family were working hard to make a better life for themselves.’

Last night Mrs Selby’s sister Melissa Silwood, 33, of Romford, said Mrs Selby had been left ‘feeling numb’ by the deaths.

She said: ‘My sister Abby is 
devastated, she can hardly talk. Louis was a mischievous little boy but 
he was always happy. He was always laughing and joking.’

Louis’s grandmother Christine Selby 
last night paid tribute to her ‘truly heroic’ son, and her grandson, 
whom she described as ‘our little bear’ in a statement released by the 
family.

Mr Selby met his wife eight years ago 
after she moved into the house next door. They soon became an item and 
went on to marry last year.

A Foreign Office spokesman said consular assistance was being provided to the family.

The tragedy comes less than a 
fortnight after British expat Brian O’Dwyer, 66, died as he tried in 
vain to rescue his five-year-old granddaughter Lara Lewis, who was swept
out to sea by a freak wave in Portugal.
