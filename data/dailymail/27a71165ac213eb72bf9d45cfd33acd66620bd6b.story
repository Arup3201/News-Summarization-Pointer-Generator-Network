Ron-Robert Zieler enhanced his reputation as one of Europe's top young goalkeepers with a clean sheet on Tuesday night as Germany defeated Spain.

Zieler, standing in for the injured Manuel Neuer, joined the likes of Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller in a star-studded line-up for the world champions.

But his professional career had a far more humble beginning.

In February 2009, Zieler made his senior debut at Northampton Town's Sixfields, of all places, in a team in which now-AFC Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa was the star man.

Zieler, now 25, could not keep out Walsall that day as he did the European champions in Vigo.

Northampton lost 2-0 in front of a crowd of 4,528, with former Arsenal midfielder Stephen Hughes and now-Oldham striker Jabo Ibehre getting the better of the man on loan from Manchester United.

Spain started with Juventus striker Alvaro Morata up front on Tuesday night, but five and a half years ago it was a strikeforce of an ageing Michael Ricketts and now-Watford captain Troy Deeney that proved too much for Northampton and Zieler.

That was one of only two senior appearances Zieler would make in a frustrating five-year spell in England, with the second coming just three days later in a 1-1 draw at Brighton and Hove Albion as now-Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick headed past him for the home side's equaliser.

Zieler moved to United as a 16-year-old from Cologne in July 2005 with a burgeoning reputation following some star performances for Germany's youth teams.

He left five years later with that reputation seemingly in tatters, having spent most of his last season at Old Trafford warming the bench for United's reserve side.

Four years on though and Zieler now has a World Cup winners' medal - although he did not play in Brazil he was in Joachim Low's squad, as he was for Euro 2012 - and four caps for his country.

Zieler joined Hannover on a free transfer in the summer of 2010, made his first-team debut in January 2011 and has not missed a Bundesliga game since, racking up 128 consecutive appearances and establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in Germany, if not Europe.

The 6ft 1in stopper has been heavily linked with a move to Borussia Dortmund to replace their ageing No 1 Roman Weidenfeller, who Zieler has now usurped as Neuer's deputy.

At 28, Neuer - undisputedly world's best goalkeeper - has plenty of years left in him but Zieler too looks set to be a part of the German set-up for a long time to come.

It is remarkable to think not only that he could not get a look-in at United, but that he played just twice for Stuart Gray's Northampton in a three-month loan spell with the League One club.

Northampton would be relegated at the end of the 2008-09 season and the man who kept Zieler out of the side, Chris Dunn, is now plying his trade with Cambridge United in League Two. Cambridge are 10th in the bottom tier while Northampton are 17th.

It looks like Zieler has had the last laugh.
