Kim Kardashian is the most well-known of the reality TV family

Sex tapes, scandals, selfies, screaming matches and diva-driven dramas both real and imagined … it is the heady mix which has helped turn the Kardashians into the most successful TV family ever.

The Klan, as they call themselves, at once the most reviled and loved dysfunctional family in the world, last week signed a record $100 million deal to keep their show Keeping Up With The Kardashians on the E! channel for another four years. 

In just seven years (it feels longer), the Kardashian girls – headed by ‘tiger mum’ Kris – have transformed themselves from, frankly, a rather tacky bunch of seemingly talentless nobodies into a global franchise reportedly valued at $1 BILLION. 

But while they have turned being ‘famous for being famous’ into a lucrative art form – using their name to flog everything from pillows to perfume – everyone has heard of them, even if they’re not sure what they do. 

Prime Minister David Cameron recently admitted he can’t fathom ‘why everyone is interested in Kim Kardashian’. 

A show insider said: ‘When the Kardashians started out, they were a laughing stock. But no one is laughing now. 

'They may have no discernible talents but they have ambition and drive in spades and they all work incredibly hard to build their brand. 

‘Underneath all the drama they are a family who truly love each other and that’s what fans relate to. The boobs and bottoms might be fake but the family drama is real and that is the secret of their success. 

They are also oddly aspirational. If the Kardashians can make a fortune, dress in designer couture and carry $10,000 handbags there’s hope for us all.’ 

The show now airs in more than 100 countries with Kim’s derriere so famous it has its own Twitter feed. So who ARE the women who have stormed reality TV – and how KAN they be the most famous family on the planet?

Khloe: The normal one

Who is she? Battling with her weight and insecure about her looks, sensible middle sister Khloe, 30, stars in her own spin-off reality shows Kourtney And Khloe Take Miami and The Hamptons. A disastrous marriage to drug-taking basketball player Lamar Odom only boosted her popularity. Reportedly worth $22 million thanks to property deals. Plagued by rumours she is OJ Simpson’s illegitimate child. Has fiercely denied all such claims. 

Kringe Factor: In a 2013 episode of Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, Khloe was the judge in a competition between Kim and Kourtney so vulgar it is unrepeatable in a family newspaper.

Khloe and Kim: Khloe is known as the sensible middle sister while Kim hit fame for her explicit 2007 sex tape

Kim: The queen of selfies

Who is she? Paris Hilton’s one-time assistant is famous for her explicit 2007 sex tape, ample derriere and being married to husband number three, rapper Kanye West. The second eldest daughter of Kris and Robert Kardashian, Kim is the star of the family reality TV series and worth $45 million, according to Forbes. 

Kringe Factor: In 2013, Kim surpassed herself when she straddled and simulated sex with then fiance Kanye West in music video Bound 2. It went viral and was much parodied. The ‘selfie’ queen also treats her 27 million fans on photo-sharing website Instagram to the occasional ‘belfie’ or bum selfie. Last year she balanced a champagne glass on her buttocks.

Kris: The mastermind

Who is she? Known as the ‘momager’, Kris masterminds her daughters’ every move. A former airline stewardess, Kris, 59, is creator, star and executive producer of the reality show, has her own collection on QVC and has just released a cookbook. Her late ex-husband and father to Kim, Khloe and Kourtney was lawyer Robert Kardashian, who represented OJ Simpson. She divorced second husband Bruce Jenner, father to Kendall and Kylie, last year and recently moved toyboy Corey Gamble, who at 33 is 26 years her junior, into her California mansion. 

Kringe Factor: Last year, Kris donned her tightest Lyrca catsuit and most vertiginous heels for a pole-dancing class. Is open about plastic surgery and her ‘amazing’ sex life

Mother and daughter: (L-R) Kris masterminds her daughters’ every move. Her eldest is Kourtney

Kourtney: The Earth mother 

Who is she? The oldest of the Kardashian girls at 35, Kourtney is considered by many as the ‘boring one’. Has several spin-off shows and is reportedly worth $20 million. Along with sisters Kim and Khloe, Kourtney owns upmarket US boutique Dash and clothing line Kardashian Kollection, sold though Dorothy Perkins in UK. 

Kringe Factor: Kourtney allowed the cameras to keep rolling for Penelope’s birth in 2012. Was even shown pulling the little girl out with her own hands.

Kendall: The supermodel

Who she is? Model of the moment, Kendall has managed to carve out a career away from her half-sisters’ TV antics. The 19-yearold was queen of New York Fashion Week last month. She is also the new $5 million ‘face’ of Estée Lauder and counts fellow model Cara Delevingne as a best friend. 

Kringe Factor: Surprisingly scandal free. Once dated Harry Styles but refuses to discuss it publicly. Has taken the mature decision not to bare all on the show. ‘Kendall is determined to have a proper career as a model,’ a friend says. ‘She’s the one to watch.’

Younger sisters: (L-R) Kendall, the model of the moment, and Kylie, the baby of the Klan

Kylie: The baby 

Who is she? The baby of the clan, but no shrinking violet, Kylie is reportedly worth $2 million. The 17-year-old will this year design a collection for Topshop and is already CEO of several businesses including Kylie Hair Kouture. Has her own collections with OPI Nail Polish and US shoe ‘king’ Steve Madden. 

Kringe Factor: Hangs with the Hollywood ‘brat pack’ headed by Justin Bieber. Has an on-off relationship with rapper Tyga, 25, who reportedly left the mother of his child for her. Reports of late-night partying have been swirling around of late. 

After divorcing Kris last year, 1976 US Olympic gold decathlete Bruce Jenner is focusing on ‘transitioning’ into a woman

P.S. Meet the man of the house (until he has a sex change)

Who is he? After divorcing Kris last year, the 1976 US Olympic gold decathlete is focusing on ‘transitioning’ into a woman. Once he has completed his gender reassignment, Bruce Jenner will reportedly be known as Belinda. He will be sharing his ‘journey’ into womanhood in a documentary but the series was recently put on hold while Bruce deals with the legal repercussions of a tragic car accident in which a woman died. 

Kringe Factor: In a 2013 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris admitted she and Bruce had once made a sex tape. Unlike his daughter, the former Olympian had the sense to erase it afterwards.
