Tragedy: Fisherman's Friend singer Trevor Grills has died in hospital after a metal door fell on top of him on Saturday

A singer with a shanty sea group has died in hospital after a metal door fell on him and killed the band's promoter in a freak accident at a concert venue.

Fisherman’s Friends singer Trevor Grills, 54, is believed to have been unloading gear 
for a gig with promoter Paul McMullen when the tragedy occurred at G Live in Guildford, Surrey, on 
Saturday morning.

Mr McMullen, 44, suffered serious leg injuries and was treated by paramedics but died at the scene.

Mr
Grills was rushed to St George’s Hospital, Tooting, South London, with serious head injuries but died in hospital last night.

In a statement, the band paid tribute to Mr Grills as 'a much-loved and valued friend'.

A spokesman added: 'We are all devastated'.

Saturday night’s concert by the
ten-piece Cornwall-based act, who sang When The Boat Comes In for a 
Young’s seafood advert on TV, was cancelled.

The Health and Safety Executive has been informed of the tragedy.

It is believed the nine singers not involved in the accident have returned home to north Cornwall.

In a statement today, the Port Isaac singers said: 'The Fisherman’s Friends announce with great sadness that their friend and fellow band member Trevor Grills passed away last night as a result of severe head injuries inflicted during an accident on Saturday February 9.

'Trevor was a much-loved and valued friend to all of us and was an integral part of the Port Isaac community. He will be sadly missed. Our thoughts are with Trevor’s family at this very difficult time.'

Darcus Beese, president of Island Records, the group’s label, added: 'We are all deeply saddened at losing Trevor. The Fisherman’s Friends are exactly that: life-long partners in all they do and our thoughts and prayers go out to them and Trevor’s family and friends.'

Tragic: Band promoter Paul McMullen was killed when a door fell on him at G Live venue in Guildford

Fans rocked by news of the tragedy today paid tribute to Mr Grills, one of the younger members of the Fisherman's Friends who often took the lead in some of the band's more melancholic numbers.

Writing on the group's Facebook page, Sarah Lee said: 'Words seem pointless, but apart from sending you all love there's not much else we can offer. Know that you are in our hearts at this terribly sad time.'

Fellow fan Charlie Mason added: 'Such sad news - we saw you all in Cheltenham on Thursday, and loved it - Trevor bought joy to people - a gift few of us have. We've lost someone special.'

Steph Woodhouse wrote: 'Oh such dreadful news, was hoping against hope he would pull through. Our thoughts are with his family, friends and all the village that has welcomed us so warmly over the years. Thinking of Port Isaac.'

The venue G Live in Guildford where the incident happened has since reopened but the loading bay remains off-bounds.

The 
venue’s main hall is home to the prestigious International Orchestral 
Concert Series, which features the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and 
London Symphony Orchestra among its concerts.

It
also holds children’s shows and community activities as well as 
conferences, business events and is home to a restaurant and cafe.

Venue director Alvin Hargreaves said: 'We are devastated to hear that Fisherman's Friends band member Trevor Grills died in hospital last night as a result of the head injuries suffered on Saturday.

'The tragic events of Saturday also 
claimed the life of the band's promoter. Both men were involved in an 
accident in the loading bay area of the G Live concert venue prior to 
their scheduled performance that evening.

'Surrey Police and the Health and 
Safety Executive investigations are ongoing with no further information 
being available at this time. Guildford Borough Council and HQ Theatres,
who own and manage the venue respectively, continue to fully assist 
with the investigation.

'The thoughts and prayers of the G 
Live staff are with the families and friends of all who have been 
affected by this tragic accident.'

All
of the Fisherman’s Friends, who have performed in Port Isaac for more 
than 15 years, are or were fishermen, coastguards or lifeboatmen.

Tributes
were paid to Mr McMullen, who is thought to have been 
married and a father. In a statement Darcus Beese, president of the 
group’s label, Island Records, said: ‘Everyone here is shocked by this 
tragic event, our hopes and prayers go out to the friends and families 
of those involved.’

A 
spokesman for a group, Said The Maiden, who had worked with the singers,
said: ‘We are deeply saddened by the news. Paul was an amazing man, who
gave us a fabulous opportunity to sing for the Fisherman’s Friends.

'We feel honoured and grateful to have been able to work with him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the guys.’

The Fisherman's Friends are shanty singers from Port Isaac on Cornwall's rugged, panoramic north coast

There
were more tributes on social media sites. Bekki Vousden said: ‘Was a 
pleasure knowing and working with such a lovely guy, my heart goes out 
to your family.’

Performer Davina Lines wrote: ‘Your family and friends will miss you very much. You were a top bloke.’

It is believed Mr McMullen, of Disley, Stockport, had been touring with the band for several months.

On Facebook, Mr McMullen's sister Sarah McMullen paid an emotional tribute to her brother.

She said: 'As a family we are in shock and devastated. Paul loved you and was very proud of the fact that he worked with you.

'Please keep singing, and sing one for him as soon as you are able.'

Friend
Jacqueline O’Connor said: 'As a neighbour and foremost a friend for 
seven years I can certainly say my life has been enriched for knowing 
Paul McMullen.

'Always a delight, nothing to dislike, a good person to the core...one of life’s treasures that will be sorely missed.'

The sea shanty group were given a £1m recording contract after being discovered by music industry bosses during a pub concert.

They have since performed at the Glastonbury Festival.

Ealing Studios has also been working on developing a film charting the rise of the a capella group.

It is believed the nine members of the group not involved in the accident have since returned to their homes in north Cornwall.

Surrey Police is investigating and the 
Health and Safety Executive - which investigates work-based accidents - 
has been notified.

The £26m G Live building was designed as a 'state-of-the-art' venue and hosts music, dance and comedy shows.

In
recent months it has played host to a number of well-known acts 
including the Russian State Ballet and indie band The Kaiser Chiefs.

Acts due to play at the venue include Jools Holland and The Stranglers.

The 1,700 capacity venue was hailed as a 'local landmark' by councillors when it opened in 2011.

Speaking
at its opening, Mayor of Guildford Councillor Terence Patrick said: 
'The state-of-the-art venue realises our vision for a vibrant, dynamic 
space for the community.

'It will give a boost to the local economy and is part of our strong commitment to the arts and leisure.'
