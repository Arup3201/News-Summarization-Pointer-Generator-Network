A bus driver died when his vehicle’s folding doors closed on his neck, an inquest heard. 

Darren Morley, 50, was killed as he tried to fix one of the two passenger doors after it got stuck when his last customer alighted.

His body was found in Wigan, Greater Manchester, by a dog walker.

Coroner Jennifer Leeming said on-board CCTV footage, not yet screened to the jury inquest, showed father-of-four Mr Morley getting out of his cab to investigate before the doors close on him.

Tragic: Bus driver Darren Morley, fro Wigan, Greater Manchester, who died when the folding doors of his vehicle closed on his neck

A pathologist told the hearing he died due to compression of the neck and that injuries to his body indicated his desperate struggle to get free.

It was at around 6.30pm on October 9 last year when passer-by Amanda Bowdler came across the Stagecoach bus and its collapsed driver not far from the company depot in Bryn.

She told Bolton Coroner’s Court: 'I saw a bus parked up in the lay-by. All the lights were on but the driver wasn’t sitting in his seat and I knew something was wrong. I have seen buses parked there before.

'I went past and doubled backed and that’s when I saw Mr Morley trapped in the doors of the bus.

'He showed 
no signs of life. I ran in the middle of the road and flagged a lorry 
driver down. He felt Mr Morley’s neck and thought he was dead.'

Consultant
 forensic pathologist Dr Naomi Carter gave the cause of his death as 
compression of the neck - explaining how this can result in 'compression
 of the air passage, stimulation of nerves and cuts off blood.'

Dr Carter said Mr Morley had grazes to his neck consistent with injuries obtained from the doors as

well as injuries to his forearms and bruising to his legs, indicating how he had tried to get free before he died.

Mr Morley’s partner, Angela Connor, paid tribute to him through a statement read out by the coroner, describing him as a devoted father.

She said he was 'family-orientated' and 'happy' and 'provided for all his family through hard work and did whatever needed to provide for them financially and emotionally'.

Mrs Connor told how he had gained employment with First buses, which later went on to become Stagecoach, in 2005 and 'thoroughly enjoyed his job and was highly regarded by his employers'.

She went on to describe how she spent the night before Mr Morley’s tragic death with him at their home watching television and last saw him at 6am the next day as she left for work.

She said: 'Unfortunately later that evening the police attended to inform me that Darren had passed away and I later became aware that he had become trapped in the doors in Bryn.

'Darren will be missed by all who came to know him, especially me, his children, his family and his friends.

'He was a wonderful person. I’m devastated by his death and wonder how I will cope.'

The inquest continues.
