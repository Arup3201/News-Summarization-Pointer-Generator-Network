A second cracked engine in a Boeing Dreamliner has been found just two months after a similar plane's engine cracked and failed during a test run that sparked a fire off its runway in South Carolina.

Adding further federal scrutiny to the jetliner, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board uncovered the latest cracks after a recommended review of all Boeing 787 and 747 engines by the Federal Aviation Administration earlier this month.

After the forward end of a fan midshaft (FMS) fractured and separated in a General Electric GEnx-1B turbofan engine on July 28 in Charleston, examination of other models revealed the second engine's crack.

That GEnx jet engine, while installed on a 787-8 airplane, had not been flown yet, according to aÂ release by the NTSB on Thursday.

In an urgent letter to the FAA earlier this month by the NTSB requesting the engines' inspection, the safety board worried of similar engine explosions that spewed hot metal onto the runway of Charleston International Airport creating a small brush fire.

The Boeing 787-8 was undergoing a low-speed taxi test during that incident, according to the NTSB with no passengers aboard or injuries reported.

The news comes just days after a similar Boeing 747-8F with a GEnx-1B turbofan lost power during takeoff in Shanghai, China.

The safety board said on Thursday that their investigation with the Civil Aviation Administration of China into the design and manufacture of the engine and aircraft is ongoing.

Currently there have been no indications of cracking in that jet engine with its FMS found intact.

All of the GEnx engines are manufactured at a GE facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, CNN reports, with GE being the largest maker of jet engines.

While the Dreamliner is currently only operating by carriers outside the U.S., United Airlines plans to be the first U.S. domestic carrier of the Boeing jets come November.

Earlier this month on September 8 India received their first Dreamliner at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in fanfare celebration making their first of 27 ordered by Air India.

The national carrier's 787s will be powered by the General Electric GEnx-1B engines.

'We have done the checks on all our GE engines,' Jack Jones, Boeing vice president and general manager, said earlier this month at an international trade conference near Charleston, South Carolina.

'GE has done a great job of figuring out quickly what we have to do to ensure the integrity of the engine. We know that and we've implemented it.'

Jones said the engine issue had not affected Boeing's schedule of delivering planes. 'It obviously didn't stop deliveries. That is absolutely critical,' he said.

Playing catch up after a long and rocky start, the American-manufactured airliner has experienced massive cost overruns and hundreds of backlogged orders due to assembly problems.

Previous problems and inspections have included concerns over the fuselage's structural stiffeners or shims along with software glitches that cancelled flights.
