A chocolate-mad mum has lost a staggering 10 stone after realising she looked just like a character from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.

Nicola Savory, was left red-faced when she saw a picture of herself looking exactly like the bloated blueberry character Violet Beauregarde, the greedy girl who swelled to the size of a giant blueberry after scoffing forbidden confectionery.

The 36-year-old, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, tipped the scales at 21st 10lbs but is now nearly half her size after ditching her diet of chocolate bars, sausage rolls and pasties for healthier options.

Feeling blue: Nicola Savory, 36, (right) thought she saw more than a passing resemblance to the character of Violet Beauregarde from the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

The new Nicola! After losing seven pounds in her first week of serious dieting, Nicola never looked back and lost 10 stones, going from a size 28 to a size 12

After two years of watching her weight, Nicola has dropped eight dress sizes going from a size 28 to a size 12 after attending Slimming World classes.

She said: 'I loved chocolate bars up until I saw a picture of myself and was horrified. I looked like the swollen blueberry girl from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and that's when I knew I had to lose weight.'

Nicola adds: 'Before, I'd tried every diet that you could think of including a soup diet and even one where you eat nothing but eggs.

'I would be eating scrambled eggs, egg and grapefruit, eggs on toast...but it really didn't work for me.

'With all the diets I tried, I always found myself hungry and would slip back into old habits and before I knew it I'd put on weight again.

Unearthing a new confidence: Nicola had begun to shun family parties for fear of people telling her how much weight she had gained (left) and (right) Nicola's new, slender look came after she finally found a diet that worked for her

The weight became such an issue that Nicola says she no longer felt 'comfortable in my own skin' and stopped going to family parties.

'When I missed my Nan's 80th birthday I felt dreadful, but I was sick of people saying I'd put on weight and that I looked like my mum, who was a big woman.

'It was a vicious cycle - the more depressed I was about my weight, the more food I ate.'

Nicola was nominated as Slimming World's Woman of the year for her local club in Buckinghamshire and was shortlisted in their finals of 55 women.

Before losing weight Nicola would often joke with friends about her size, especially for having to order 5XL t-shirts and shop at specialist stores for larger people.

But now, at half the woman she used to be, she's barely recognisable.

In her first week of dieting, Nicola lost seven pounds and seven days later had lost a stone after making her New Year's Resolution to lose weight.

Nikki cut back on her beloved chocolate and saw her weight plummet down to 11 stone

From then - January 2012 - she continued to battle the bulge and got down to her 11 stone target weight.

Doctors told Nicola that if she didn't lose weight she'd have to be put on blood pressure tablets at the age of 34.

Nicola said: 'I was really overweight, I'd eat a whole eight pack of sausages in one sitting.

'My ankles would swell when I walked, so would my knees and when I bent over I'd struggle to breathe.

'What stopped me before was the thought that I'd be the biggest person in the room but everyone's lovely and supportive, we all help each other lose weight.

'Now I feel so much happier in myself, I look great and nothing's holding me back.

The mum of one ditched processed food and now has an extensive selection of foods that she can cook as part of her weight loss range.

Nicola on holiday with her partner after losing the weight, she says the diet has left her feeling 'like a different woman' with a new lease of life

She said: 'The great thing is I can eat anything I just have to tweak recipes to make it leaner and cook it without fat.

'Before I'd use so much oil when cooking, I'd have sugars in my coffee it's no wonder I put all the weight on.

'Now I prefer a healthier option and feel so great for it, it tastes delicious and is good for me.

'Since losing weight I've been telling everyone - friends, family, anyone I could find that Slimming World truly helped me.

'I feel like a completely different woman now my BMI is now 26 which is great and I have so much energy.

'Although my husband's told me he'd love me whatever weight I was but personally I feel so much happier and I have much more energy.

'Now I'm not afraid to go to any family parties I'm now showing off my new figure.

'I'll never hide away from social occasions again, I feel good having my picture taken again now and we can start filling our family albums with pictures.'
