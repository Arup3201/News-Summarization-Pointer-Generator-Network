A Seattle hip-hop artist has apparently shot himself dead after writing a series of tragic Twitter messages detailing his misery and how he was going to kill himself.

Freddy E, 22, died on Saturday from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The King County medical examiner's office said an autopsy would be performed on Monday to confirm the cause.

Before his death, the performer, who was born Frederick Eugene Buhl, tweeted a long string of messages, beginning with: 'Annnd, my day is ruined.'

'If there's a God then He's calling me 
back home. This barrel never felt so good next to my dome. It's cold 
& I'd rather die than live alone,' he tweeted. 'It's... all... 
bad... y'all. *puts finger around trigger*'

Freddy E, who uploaded pictures to his Twitter account showing him partying on the day of his death, then told his family members that he loved them before posting his final tweet: 'I'm sorry.'

While investigations into his death continue, MTV reported that many fans were accusing Toronto rapper Honey Cocaine for causing the heartbreak that led Freddy E to take his life.

Cocaine, who herself was shot last year after a show in Nebraska, took to Twitter to argue that there was a connection between their relationship and his suicide.

'To say I caused what happened is ignorance,' she wrote. 'You know nothing about our
 friendship or the story, hate me if you feel. We loved each other. We 
were homies. We had a bond and a connection.

Final messages: Freddy E wrote a series of tragic tweets on Saturday before apparently taking his life

'For people to attack me 
acting like I made him do it is a shame. I said 
some foolish things cause I thought he was joking, he does shit like 
that to me all the time. This is crazy..'

Honey Cocaine, whose real name is Sochitla Sal, also tweeted a picture of text messages she exchanged with Freddy E on Saturday. 'I feel like everyone is out to get me. Is it true?' he wrote.

She 
responded: 'The devil is always out to get you in different forms...Anything revolving around money is intertwined with evil. Play your cards right and keep your soul pure cuz you can be a victim in a second.'

While the exact nature of their friendship is not known, he praised her on his Facebook page late last month and described how they were in constant contact.

'Love': Some fans said he took his life over a failed relationship with Toronto rapper Honey Cocaine, pictured, yet she called the claims 'ignorance' and maintained they were good friends

'I talk to Honey damn near every day,' 
he wrote. 'I text her. She calls me. We talk on the phone for hours. 
I've met some of her family and she's met some of mine. We call each 
other by our birth names. I'd take a bullet for her, as would she take 
one for me. I actually know her.'

On a video posted earlier this month, he added: 'Honey, you're one amazing individual. Someone doesn't have to be in your life very long for them to leave a huge impact, and she definitely did that.

'She's beautiful, ambitious, passionate about her craft. Seriously... I love that girl.'

As fans flocked to his Facebook page to pay their respects, Freddy E's family did the same.

Missed: Freddy E's father paid tribute to the 22-year-old a 'talented, sensitive, brilliant young man'

Troubled: Freddy E texted Honey Cocaine before his death to say 'I feel everyone is out to get me'

His father, Frederick Douglass Buhl, express the family's sorrow over the tragedy on his own page.

'Our family is saddened beyond words,' he wrote on Saturday. 'Our loss is great; this tragedy is
 enormous and unforeseen. Not only our family, but the world has lost a 
talented, sensitive, brilliant young man who lit up our existence with 
his.

'We love him a great deal, and he will be sorely missed. We pray that 
God will now watch over him, and we ask all of you to include Frederick 
and our entire family in your thoughts and prayers.'

Freddy E. was also known for his YouTube channel entitled 'Jerk TV' that was gaining popularity and boasted a large following.
