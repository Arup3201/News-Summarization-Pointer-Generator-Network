As England battle it out with Australia Down Under, two English cricket teams played a high stakes match of their own today - under a mountain.

The world's first underground cricket match has taken place in a slate mine in the Lake District, Cumbria.

Village cricket teams from Threlkeld and Caldbeck took to the crease at Honister Slate Mine, a network of 11 miles of underground tunnels inside Fleetwith Pike.

The match was arranged as a fundraiser after Threlkeld lost their pitch due to flooding.

Players included farmers, shopkeepers, caravan site owners, outdoor pursuit instructors and cafe owners, taking to the 'field' for the game, held in a floodlit cavern 2,000ft below ground.

The match saw six overs bowled per innings with each bowler limited to one over each, while batsmen were meant to retire on 25 runs.

There were no boundaries and batsmen had to run after every shot. It was won by Caldbeck after they scored 28 runs with one over and four balls to spare.

Threlkeld cricket team's previous 'Extreme Cricket' matches have included playing on a frozen wicket on a tarn, on a mountain and underwater in the River Derwent.
