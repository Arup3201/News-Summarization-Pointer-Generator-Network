In 1940, a naturalized American citizen of German birth set out in a patriotic exploit to work as the FBI's first double agent and bring to justice a varied cast of traitors who were stealing technological secrets to give German bombers an upper hand in their invasion of Europe.

Peter Duffy's new book 'Double Agent: The First Hero of World War II and how the FBI Outwitted and Destroyed a Nazi Spy Ring', details the work of William Sebold, an intensely patriotic man who worked with the FBI to infiltrate the Duquesne Spy Ring, a spy ring operating in New York City and one of the biggest in American history.

Duffy's book details the Nazi's attempt to recruit Sebold as their own spy in 1939, while Sebold was in the country to visit his mother. The Nazis accosted him, overly impressed with a low-level position Sebold once held in New York City, and placed him as a spy in New York City under the threat of death.

Col. Nikolaus Ritter, head of the Wehrmacht's head of military espionage, needed a man to pass information from their spies in the field to German hands, and conscripted Sebold into the position.

However, instead of bending to the threats of the Wehrmacht, Sebold covertly contacted the U.S. Consulate in Cologne, Germany, informing them of what he had been forced into. Sebold was brought back to the United States, where he met with FBI officials who devise a new plan for him.

Sebold told the FBI of spies already operating in America, and began to work with the FBI (who, at the time, had no counterespionage program in place) to set up shop in New York City, to build a case against the Americans working for the Nazis.

As he moved up the ranks of the German spy community in the United States, Sebold set up a dummy office in Times Square for German spies to hand over information to him. Among the spies that were complicit in the conspiracy were Frederick Duquesne, the leader, a war veteran, Nazi sympathizer, and overall eccentric character who wore a monocle and operated an office in Wall Street.

Duquesne was the master coordinator of the Nazi spy ring in the United States. He would reportedly call companies like Grumman Aircraft Engineering, and requesting photos and plans of their developing technology for made-up 'lectures' he was giving. Before working as a Nazi spy, Duquesne had a career as a journalist with the New York Herald. The companies often complied, and when he received the materials he would pass them to the Nazis.

Frederick 'Fritz' Duquesne, pictured left in his younger years, lead one of the largest espionage rings in American history. He was assisted by Lilly Stein (pictured right) who would often sleep with men in order to extract information from them

Sebold also came into contact with Lilly Stein, a 'femme fatale' that attempted to seduce him. Stein was a German spy who was described as a 'good-looking nymphomaniac' by one FBI agent, her specialty being luring men to bed, where they would pillow-talk about war developments or big deals taking place in industry or finance.

According to Duffy's book, Stein was effective at her job, once attempting to communicate to Germany that the British army was building 1,000 planes per day, information that would have been useful to German intelligence.

As Sebold's involvement with the Nazi spy ring got deeper, he was allowed to set up telegraph correspondence at a cottage in Long Island. The FBI was able to glean substantial evidence to build a case by monitoring the telegraph lines and the transmissions between Sebold and the Wehrmacht.

On June 28, 1941, the FBI acted, arresting 33 Nazi spies. Of the 33 charged, 16 were convicted, including Stein, who attempted to proposition an agent to get out of being arrested.

Duquesne received an 18-year sentence for his crimes. Stein received a 12-year sentence.

The timely arrests served to deprive Adolf Hitler of the help of spies at the time he would need it the most, the convictions coming down on December 12, 1941, one day after war had been formally declared against Germany and Italy by the United States.

After his service with the FBI, Sebold was placed in an early version of the Witness Protection Program by the FBI, and was relocated to California. There, his ill health plagued him, as well as his justifiable fear of reprisal by the remnants of the Nazis. In letters sent to him by his family, the Germans involved with the Wehrmacht still sought revenge against him.

Eventually, he was committed to Napa State Hospital, in Napa, California, where he arrived broke and losing his mind. He was diagnosed as having manic depression, and died of a heart attack five years later.

Duffy's book details the previously unsung tale of Sebold, and provides background on what J. Edgar Hoover called 'the most outstanding case in Bureau history.'

'Double Agent' is scheduled to hit bookshelves nationwide on July 22, 2014.
