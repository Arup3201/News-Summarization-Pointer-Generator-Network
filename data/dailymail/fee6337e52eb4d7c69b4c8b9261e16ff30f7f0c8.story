Simon Cox bundled home a late winner for Reading as they triumphed in a pulsating clash with Millwall.

The Lions had fought back from two goals down thanks to Ricardo Fuller and Mark Beevers but were left heart-broken when Cox turned in Jordan Obita's corner at the back post with just five minutes left.

It was a little harsh on Ian Holloway’s side, who once again demonstrated how far they have advanced since last season’s relegation struggles.

They refused to lie down after Reading’s lightning-fast start yielded two goals inside the opening quarter-hour and indeed looked favourites to snatch the win for long spells in the second-half.

Reading stormed out of the blocks and had the lead after six minutes. It was classic ‘route one’ as Simon Cox chested down Adam Federici’s enormous goal kick, used his body strength to get past Jimmy Abdou and Scott Malone and beat David Forde with a low 25-yard shot.

Reading were rampant and from their next assault, Glenn Murray missed a golden opportunity to double the advantage, heading wide from Jordan Obita’s cross with Forde flapping and the entire goal gaping.

It didn’t matter as on Reading’s next attack a minute later, Byron Webster tripped Nicky Blackman inside the area and referee Keith Hill pointed to the spot without hesitation. Blackman dusted himself down to send Forde the wrong way from the spot.

Millwall had not been without chances. Federici saved from Fuller’s looping header early on and then pulled off a superb double stop to deny Malone with his legs and Scott McDonald’s follow-up with a remarkable reflex action.

Millwall thought they had secured a hard-fought point when Beevers headed home the second half equaliser

Consequently, it was little surprise when Millwall halved the deficit on 39 minutes. Malone marauded down the left, cut inside and fed Fuller, who tucked the ball low past Federici to give the visitors hope before half-time.

And the scores could have been level before the break, with Federici stretching his fingertips to push Fuller’s 25-yard shot over the crossbar.

Equally, Reading could easily have restored their two-goal cushion when Murray found himself unmarked inside the box, albeit standing in an offside positions, but blazed over anyway.

The Millwall momentum continued into the second half and Millwall equalised when Mark Beevers headed in Martyn Woolford’s floated free-kick to the back post after Federici lost flight of the ball.

It was unfortunate for the Australian, who lost track of the deep cross in the floodlights, and rather negated all his excellent work in the first period.

The two sides had entered the match with identical records, so it was fitting they found themselves at level pegging. Something had to give and the match swung in the balance as both pressed and probed.

Millwall substitute Ed Upson stung the palms of Federici with a blast from 25 yards but it was Cox who had the final say as the Royals pocketed all three points.
