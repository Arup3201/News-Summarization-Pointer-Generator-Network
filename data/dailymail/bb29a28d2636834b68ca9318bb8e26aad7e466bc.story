A motorist was slapped with a parking ticket after fake yellow lines were painted in her street, which a traffic warden thought were real.

Tanya Blackman, 37, came home to find the markings had appeared in her road in Truro, Cornwall.

Miss Blackman said residents face fierce competition for a handful of parking spaces and she realised the 'wobbly' lines were a ruse.

But they looked good enough to fool a traffic warden, who duly issued her vehicle with a £50 ticket.

Cleaning company boss Tanya said: 'It just didn't look real and it was a bit wobbly.

'I parked on it and got yellow paint on my tyres.

'Then I got the ticket for parking and just went mad.'

Miss Blackman told thisiscornwall.co.uk that neighbours had previously placed traffic cones near to her car when she parked in the space.

She said she contacted Cornwall Council about the fake lines and challenged the ticket.

Her challenge was upheld and the council cancelled her ticket on April 26.

Another resident in the road, who did not want to identified, said parking was a problem on the street.

Cornwall Council has now confirmed the yellow lines which appeared in the road were fake. 

A spokesman said: 'We have cancelled the parking ticket which was originally issued to Miss Blackman and a highways crew will be removing the fake yellow lines. 

'Painting anything on the public highway is an offence under section 132 of the Highways Act 1980 which could lead to a £100 fine for the first offence and £200 for any second and subsequent offences.

'However, as there is no clear evidence as to who painted the fake lines, it is unlikely that it would be in the public interest to take this matter any further.' 

Inspector Mark Richards, from Truro police, said the matter had not been reported to officers.
