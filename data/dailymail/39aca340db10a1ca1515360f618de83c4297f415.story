They were once the preserve of teenagers happy to escape their parents for a cheap weekend.

But now the average festival-goer is in their mid-30s, according to a new study which has found younger audiences have been priced out of the market.

As many as 60 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds have vowed not to go to a festival this year because of a hike in ticket prices.

The average festival-goer is now in their mid-30s as younger audiences have been priced out of the market, meaning they cannot attend festivals like Glastonbury (pictured)

To attend a festival in the UK, music fans must now expect to pay £423.01 on average for tickets, transport, food and drink and camping gear.

And research revealed fans attending Scotland's T in the Park festival are the oldest at 37 years seven months old on average.

Those attending Glastonbury are the second oldest music fans at 36 years eight months, followed by the Isle of Wight at 36 years one month old.

The findings of the study, by publishing brand MSN, suggest that it is those with more disposable incomes who are able to go to festivals.

Younger music fans, like these at Glastonbury festival, claims that the soaring costs for a ticket means that they can no longer afford to see their favourite bands

The price of a Glastonbury ticket has almost doubled in the last decade, from £105 in 2003 to £205 this year.

What's more, there has been an increasing trend towards older and more established headline acts.

Nearly half of festival goers (43 per cent) say they are most excited to see acts that have been around for at least a decade.

Interestingly, of the headlining acts at 2013 UK festivals, only Mumford & Sons released their debut album within the last five years.

Of the older acts due to headline this year, Eminem is at Reading and Leeds, Rolling Stones are at Glastonbury, and the Stone Roses at Isle of Wight.

The average age of the musicians in the 10 most anticipated headliners in 2013 is 39 years eight months.

The research, which involved 2,000 UK adults, revealed a breakdown of the costs a festival entails.

On average, a festival-goer will spend just over £100 on their ticket, £80 on food and drink and £70 on camping gear.

Meanwhile, to get to and from a music event a fan will tend to fork out £60.

Of those fans who aren't attending a festival this year, 55 per cent say they will take a foreign holiday or go to an international music festival instead.

But, one in ten Brits are not fazed by the price increase and would even be prepared to spend £800 on attending a festival.

Graduate student Kirsty Archer, 21, from London, said: 'My friends and I were thinking of going to the Latitude festival in Suffolk this summer.

'But, unfortunately it's just out of our league price-wise - the costs really add up.

'We'll probably do a long weekend in Europe instead.

'I've worked out even with flights, accommodation and spending money, I'll still get change from the price of the ticket alone.'

James Hurley, MSN music editor, said: 'Festivals have always been seen as a key part of youth culture, but the study shows this is no longer the case.

'Not only are people in their 30s now dominating the UK's main festivals, the majority of headlining artists are long-established veterans.

'With a UK festival costing an average of £423.01, it's hardly surprising to see younger music fans are finding themselves priced out.'
