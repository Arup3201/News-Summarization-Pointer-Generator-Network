Questioned: Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, has been interviewed under caution by Operation Yewtree detectives in Stafford, Staffordshire

Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, has been interviewed under caution by Operation Yewtree detectives in connection with allegations of sexual offences, it has been reported. 

The Australian presenter was questioned this week at a police station in Stafford, Staffordshire, by officers investigating historic sex offences in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Harris was jailed for five years and nine months last July for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986.

His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed.  

A spokesman from the Metropolitan Police did not name Harris, but said an 84-year-old man had been questioned on Tuesday and Wednesday, the BBC reported.

He added that the man arrested has already been questioned under Operation Yewtree. Their inquiries continue.

Harris was reportedly transferred to Stafford prison in October from HMP Bullingdon, in Oxfordshire, after being repeatedly targeted by other inmates. 

Operation Yewtree is the police probe set up in the wake of disclosures that former BBC DJ Jimmy Savile was a prolific paedophile.

The investigation has three strands of inquiry. One relates to Savile's crimes and the second relates to allegations against Savile and others.

The third strand, under which Mr Harris was questioned, concentrates on accusations unconnected to the Savile investigations but which emerged as a result of the publicity surrounding the late DJ. 

So far more than a dozen people have been arrested as part of the investigation.

Five celebrities have been convicted for sex crimes under Operation Yewtree.

Former glam rock singer Gary Glitter was today found guilty of carrying out a string of sex attacks on young girls while at the height of his fame.

He was found guilty of of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13. 

Former PR guru Max Clifford, artist Rolf Harris, and former BBC radio presenter Chris Denning have all been jailed following trials brought under Operation Yewtree.

Former BBC Radio One host Dave Lee Travis was given a suspended sentence after being convicted for indecent assault.
