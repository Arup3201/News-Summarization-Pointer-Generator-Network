A Suncor employee has been mauled to death by a black bear at an oil sands site in Canada, as her helpless co-workers watched in horror.

Lorna Weafer, 36, was dragged from her seven colleagues and brutally attacked yesterday while she was doing electrical work at the remote Fort McMurray, Alberta site.

Her work mates, who weren't carrying bear spray, blasted air horns to scare the animal away, but couldn't save the instrument technician.

'People tried to stop it and do 
everything they could,' union spokesman Scott Doherty told CBC News. 'Obviously, they are fairly horrified 
at what they saw and witnessed.'

Responding police officers shot dead an aggressive bear prowling around the work site. CTV News reported tests are underway to determine whether it was the same bear that killed Weafer.

'There are a lot of people on these sites, so we had to take the safety of those people into account,' Ft. McMurray RCMP spokesman Cpl. George Cameron told Global News.

'That’s probably the main reason why the bear was shot. We didn’t want this unfortunate incident to happen again.'

A wildlife officer investigating the tragic incident said the attack was 'predatory' and there were no 'non-natural attractants' at the remote site.

Bear behavior expert Stephen Herrero said such attacks are 'exceedingly rare', with the last black bear attack in Alberta occurring about 13 years ago.

'Something in the bear says 'Maybe this is something I can capture kill and eat',' Herrero, from the University of Calgary, told Global News.

Meanwhile, Suncor has promised to investigate the incident and extended their condolences to Weafer's loved ones.

'This is an absolutely tragic event,' Suncor spokesperson Sneh Seetal said. 'We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families.'

Seetal said workers are regularly trained on how to interact with wildlife.

Union spokesman Scott Doherty said the union plans to conduct a full review into the incident, which is the third third work fatality in four months at the Suncor site.

'If there needs to be a revision or some additional procedures and policies in place to ensure the safety of workers from wildlife attacks, we are definitely going to do that,' he said.
