A woman in Florida who didn't like her neighbors has been arrested for allegedly having their mobile home demolished.

Ana Maria Moreta Folch of St. Augustine told a heavy equipment operator that she owned the trailer and wanted it and its septic tank destroyed.

That wasn't the case, however, as the real owners arrived at the scene when the demolition was underway on Monday.

The St. Johns County Sheriff's arrest report says Moreta Folch wanted the trailer bulldozed because she thought its occupants were unsavory and she suspected they had broken into her car.

For the construction crew's part, she was able to convince them that it was her trailer because she had a key to the trailer.

The trailer's owner, 34-year-old Maria Gottfried, told the deputy sheriff said she had owned the trailer since 2006.

The Florida Times-Union reports that she claimed to have never given Moreta Folch, 62, a key.

Ms Gottfried said she did not have a bad relationship with Moreta Folch.

All of the belongings had been removed so that it was completely empty and did not look like anyone was living inside.

The paper reports that the damage was estimated at about $25,000.

Moreta Folch was charged with criminal mischief, a third-degree felony.

She was released Wednesday on $10,000 bail.
