Harrowing audio and video footage has revealed the moment a drunk Texas student was shot dead by a police officer during a traffic stop.

Cameron Redus, a student at University of the Incarnate Wood, was killed by Corporal Christopher Carter outside his San Antonio, Texas, apartment on December 6, 2013.

The officer's microphone captures the 23-year-old accusing Carter of trying to sexually assault him and calling him pathetic. His last words are: 'You are going to shoot me?'

Carter told Redus to stop 29 times and asked him to put his hands behind his back 20 times.

He ignores repeated requests by Carter to stop and put his hands on the hood of the patrol car. 

Carter, who resigned from from the University of Incarnate Word police force after the shooting, has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing after a Bexar (BAYR) County grand jury decided not to indict him on Wednesday,KENS 5 reported.

Redus had a blood alcohol level of .155 when he was pulled over. His family contend that his son did make some mistakes that night, but they did not warrant the severity of the response. 

An autopsy conducted in March last year revealed all of the five shots fired by Carter were at close range.

In the build-up Carter is heard on the audio repeatedly telling Redus to 'stay right there'.

The front-facing camera in Carter's car was not working at the time, so all you can see is the back seats of his patrol car.  

Moments later Carter is heard telling Redus to step back before firing six bullets (scene pictured) 

You can hear Redus telling the officer he is scared and during the pat down says: 'Are you going to rape me right now?'

Carter then tells him to put his hands behind his back as he is under arrest.

The struggle then heats up as the pair fight for control. At one point Redus accuses the officer of choking him.

He then tells Carter: 'You are pathetic. Are you going to shoot me if I don't stop?'

'Is that what cops do? They shoot people.'

All the while Carter keeps telling Redus to stop, but he refuses to listen.

Redus then says: 'You piece of s***'. Carter then fires six shots at close range, killing Redus.

The student's family have said he was never aggressive or confrontational but, according to Corporal Carter, Cameron tried to beat him with his own baton after he was pulled over for driving erratically.

Redus' family contends that even though he made some mistakes that night, he did not deserve the aggressive response by Corporal Carter 

His parents, Mickey and Valerie Redus, and their other sons, released a statement last year saying they were 'devastated' by the autopsy findings.

'We are stunned to learn that Cameron was
 shot in the back from very close range. The report also shows that the 
shot to his eye was delivered at a downward angle, again from very close
 range,' they wrote.

'That knowledge, coupled with information from the earlier police 
report indicating that Cameron died on his back with his legs underneath
 him, has left us heartbroken and shaken to the core.'

The family added that they did not 
condone his decision to drive while under the influence, but said they 
were 'thankful' he arrived home safely without harming anyone else on 
the night in question.

They added: 'Cameron’s mistakes do not negate the 
amazing and productive life he lived nor the loving, encouraging and 
compassionate person that he was.

'While mistakes do bear consequences, 
the extreme and brutal results of Cameron’s encounter with Officer 
Carter far exceed the magnitude of his mistakes.'

The University of Incarnate Wood said they have fully supported the decision to release the audio tape of the confrontation. 

Following Carter's clearance by a grand jury, the school's management said in a release that they hope the recording will 'put to rest much of the misinformation disseminated by persons characterizing the recording.'

They reveal that during the recording, you will hear Carter say:

'Put your hands behind your back' – 20 times.

'Stop resisting' – 25 times

'Stop' or 'Stop it' – 29 times

'Stop or I will shoot you' – 5 times

'You are under arrest'/'being arrested'/'resisting arrest' – 3 times.

The last statements made by Cpl. Carter to Mr. Redus are: 'Stop, stop, stop, stop, get back, get back!'
