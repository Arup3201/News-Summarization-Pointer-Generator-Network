It has long been a much-loved staple of the British breakfast. 

But bacon has been given a healthy makeover – and for many, the results are… well, a little fishy.

Salmon bacon, which has proved a hit in Canada, Hong Kong and the home of traditional bacon, Denmark, is set to be launched in UK supermarkets and restaurants.

As well as being the perfect solution for non-meat eaters or those following a halal or kosher diet, its makers say it is also a healthier alternative, containing nearly 100 calories fewer per serving than traditional bacon.

Makers MacKnight claims it ‘eats and tastes better than traditional smoked bacon’.

However, a survey by The Mail on Sunday revealed some shoppers will be loath to give up their bacon sandwiches any time soon. 

None of the 12 who took part in a ‘blind’ test thought the rashers were real bacon.

A 6oz (170g) pack with six rashers will cost £3, making it the same price as supermarkets’ own brands, such as Sainsbury’s Taste The Difference 7.7oz (220g) pack of six Oak Smoked rashers, which costs £3.30.

However, the salmon contains 192 calories per 100g compared with 275 in the pork bacon.

None of the 12 people who took part in a survey said they would swap their bacon sandwich for the salmon alternative 

Sous chef Jerome Davidson, 34, from Wembley, North-West London, said: ‘You can taste the smoky flavour. It’s similar to bacon and there’s no fat, so it will catch on.’

However, Chris Newton, a retired teacher from Islington, North London, was scathing: ‘It looks horrible and tastes like anchovies. I’d never buy it.’

Others liked it – but said it could never replace real bacon. Alfie Grogan, 24, from Bermondsey, South-East London, added: ‘I’d eat salmon bacon, but for breakfast it must be real bacon.’

The Mail on Sunday’s food critic Tom Parker Bowles delivered a withering verdict: ‘The raw product isn’t bad. 

'Slightly above average smoked salmon, cut to look like a rasher – if bacon slices suddenly turned a light orange and smelled of fish.

‘But the moment I threw it into a pan, it tensed and dried up, and started to resemble overcooked farmed salmon. It’s bland and dreary, and miles removed from bacon. Why bother going to all this trouble to sell smoked salmon as something that it’s not?’

Tony Ingham, of MacKnight, said: ‘It crisps like bacon, is as versatile, and makes a great breakfast bun with brown sauce. We’re convinced it is going to be a healthy lifestyle option – it’s high in omega 3 fatty acids that are good for the heart.’
