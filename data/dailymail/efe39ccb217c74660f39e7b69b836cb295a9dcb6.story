Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday the United States is setting up a $5billion 'terrorism partnership fund' to help other countries push back against radical extremists.

Appearing on a host of network morning-show interviews, Kerry staunchly defended President Barack Obama's decision to terminate the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan by the end of the year.

Referring in a 'Today' show interview to a speech Obama was set to give later Wednesday at the U.S. Military Academy, Kerry said Obama is telling the Afghans 'by a specific time they have to take over management of their own security and military.'

Kerry said the message to Afghanistan is 'we're not going to give you all the time in the world. You have to push the envelope.'

'This is not an abandonment of Afghanistan,' Kerry said.

'This is an emboldenment. This is an empowerment of Afghanistan.'

Appearing on 'CBS This Morning,' he said the withdrawal plan of the U.S. will allow this country to divert resources to the anti-terrorism fight in other parts of the world. Kerry said U.S. foreign policy needs to reflect a 'rapidly changing, more complex world where terrorism is the principal challenge.'

Kerry called the Afghanistan troop withdrawal announcement 'a statement of transition' and said that 'if you tell the Afghans we'll be here as long as it takes, you can absolutely bet your bottom dollar they'll take as long as they want.'

The secretary also said 'it is exactly what the American people have always sought in Afghanistan' and said 'the Afghans want us to transition out.'

During his interview on ABC's 'Good Morning America,' Kerry was asked for an update on U.S. efforts to win the release of nearly 300 schoolgirls abducted by Islamic extremists in Nigeria.

'We have people on the ground and we're working hand in hand with Nigerians,' he replied.

Kerry also talked about National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden on Wednesday, calling him a fugitive who should 'man up and come back to the United States.'

Kerry was asked on the Today show about an interview Snowden recently gave in which he said he never intended to be holed up in Russia but was forced to go there because Washington decided to 'revoke my passport.'

Asked about Snowden's comments, Kerry replied: 'Well, for a supposedly smart guy, that's a pretty dumb answer, after all.'

'If Mr. Snowden wants to come back to the United States, we'll have him on a flight today.'

Kerry said Snowden should 'stand up in the United States and make his case to the American people.'

In his interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams, a portion of which was broadcast Tuesday, Snowden said he was 'trained as a spy' and argued that he had a much larger role in U.S. intelligence than the government has acknowledged.

'I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word, in that I lived and worked undercover overseas,' he said.

Kerry said, 'A patriot would not run away. ... He can come home but he's a fugitive from justice.'

'Let him come back and make his case,' the secretary added. 'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice.'

'I think he's confused,' Kerry added.

'I think it's very sad. But this is a man who has done great damage to his country.'
