A senior Korean Air executive is facing up to 10 years in prison over claims that she delayed a plane leaving JFK over the way she was served nuts.

Heather Cho, a senior vice-president at the airline, demanded the removal of a crew member from a flight on December 5 for failing to serve nuts on a plate.

Cho, who is also the eldest daughter of airline Chairman Cho Yang Ho, forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal to drop of the inept employee.

South Korea’s Transport Ministry announced on Monday that they are investigating if Cho violated the Aviation Safety Law, which states that passengers should not cause disturbances, including using violent language or yelling, for safety reasons.

Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12:50 a.m. departure from JFK when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class, reports the Korean Times.

The junior flight attendant's faux pas was to serve the nuts inside the bag that they came in rather than presenting them on a small dish - as is protocol. 

Cho screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines.

When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him to get off the flight.

'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times.

Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the pilots decided to give in to her demands and return to the airport to drop off the attendant.  

As their investigation gets underway, the Transport Ministry must try to figure out if Cho’s behavior warrants a prison sentence.

'We’ll see whether her behavior was against the law,' a ministry official told the Korean Times. 'It is an unprecedented case, so we need to see the related regulations.'

'Even though she is senior vice president at the company, she was a passenger at that time, so she had to behave and be treated as a passenger,' they added. 

'She could have taken other measures after coming back to Korea, such as strengthening service training.'
