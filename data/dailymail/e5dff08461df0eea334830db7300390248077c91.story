It was more a case of cat-napping than cat-burglar for one Florida man after deputies caught him fast asleep on a bed during a robbery - but not before they snapped a picture of the hapless felon and read him his rights.

The failed robber, Dion Davis, 29, was discovered passed out on the bed of a Sarasota County home by the cleaning lady, who then obviously dialed 911.

There was a plastic bag filled with jewelry from the home lying next to him on the bed.

When officers arrived they grabbed their phones and took some pics which apparently didn't even wake Davis from his deep slumber.

Davis, who describes himself as a 'Security Equipment Technician' on his Facebook page was taken into custody and charged with burglary of an unoccupied dwelling while unarmed.

The maid told police she arrived to clean the home and discovered the kitchen window open and Davis asleep on the bed.

Deputy J. Allen said officers found open drawers in the home and clear evidence of burglary.
