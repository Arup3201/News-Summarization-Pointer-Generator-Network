A 26-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly running over and killing his mother on the driveway of his Maine home, before fleeing the scene.

Shane Jones reportedly drove his red Chevy S-10 pick-up truck into 49-year-old Kimberly Jones as he left his house in Brackett Street, Biddeford, last Sunday afternoon.

He then sped off, leaving his mother lying dead on the ground, it is alleged. He was arrested by police on Friday afternoon in nearby Sanford following a five-day manhunt.

According to a post on Biddeford Police's Facebook page, 5ft 10in the suspect struck his mother with his pick-up truck 'while leaving his residence at 5.15pm'.

Following the incident, a massive manhunt was launched for Jones, who was believed to have left the state. It is unknown how police tracked him down to Sanford on Friday.

However, he was quickly recaptured and charged with escape and aggravate forgery. 

Jones is currently being held at the jail. It is unknown whether he has a lawyer.
