Luis Suarez says he can achieve his dreams at Liverpool, but thinks this season may just be a bit too soon to break the club's 23-year title drought.

The Uruguayan striker, 27, also said he owes the club and its fans after they helped him through some 'difficult times' last summer.

After being the subject of a £40,000,001 Arsenal bid in the Summer, Suarez has been in red hot form this season, scoring 23 Premier League goals for fourth-placed Liverpool.

Is this season too soon for a Liverpool title triumph?

'I know I can achieve my dreams here. The fans have helped me so much,' Suarez told the Liverpool Echo.

'Everyone knows that I had some difficult times last summer. But they have always supported me and always had confidence in me. I really feel that support in my heart.'

Suarez has combined to lethal effect with Daniel Sturridge - who is second in the league scoring charts with 16 - to put the Reds in a great position heading into the final third of the season.
