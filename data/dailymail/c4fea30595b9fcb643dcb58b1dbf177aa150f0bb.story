Littlewoods might have been a little 
disappointed that she didn't choose to wear the brand as she picked up 
her award for Entrepreneur of the year at Tuesday's Glamour Women of the
Year awards, instead choosing a pink neoprene dress by Rachel Gilbert.

The business women - whose CV includes musician, TV presenter, author, model, columnist, pop star, 
designer and DJ - was all smiles when presented the award by Claudia 
Winkelman, but earlier was said to have confronted pregnant pop Frankie 
Sanford of The Saturdays at the star-studded event, accusing her of 
taking her husband Quinn's side in their bitter divorce battle.
