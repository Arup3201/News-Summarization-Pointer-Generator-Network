That's it from Sportsmail's live El Clasico Q&A. Thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions. Until next time! 

Pete Jenson: A lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay. If a club bid £90million for Bale or £65m for Ronaldo (bearing in mind he is 30), I think Real Madrid would consider it.

Ronaldo because it would make economic sense and Bale because it would not be unpopular with Real supporters.

They definitely won’t sell both! And quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer, especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad.

Pete Jenson: The better players were in playing the Clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at Anfield from Juan Mata.

I enjoyed both games. There were away fans in the Liverpool vs Manchester United game – that is something that is always missing from a Clasico.

Pete Jenson: Fair assessment, yes. Ronaldo was as motivated as I’ve seen him recently.

Perhaps a week of talk about Messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that. He also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at Alves as soon as he got the ball.

He took his goal well and was one of those Madrid players who didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. Messi had a strange night.

He seemed to be staying out on Marcelo’s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space. But Madrid pressed so well he didn’t see a great deal of the ball.

He certainly didn’t run the game as he did against Manchester City. But I agree once Modric and Kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself.

Pete Jenson: It was the 42nd Clasico he’d played some part in – no Barcelona player has played in more.

What he always contributed was calm. By Spanish football standards Barça vs Madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space. He’ll come back to this fixture as Barcelona manager one day, you can count on it.

Pete Jenson: The most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying.

So to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable. I don’t mind the roll-over-ten-times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value, but the hand over the face when actually you’ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome.

Pete Jenson: He was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before Ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest.

He improved in the second half but I think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch.

You have to give him some credit for that double-breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though.

I don’t think he’s very happy for several reasons.

Firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club’s supporters – he gets whistled in at the Bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so-called ‘fans’ have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground (it happened again in the early hours of this morning).

He is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out-and-out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year.

Pete Jenson: He wants to come back to England, no doubt about it. Arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first Chelsea and now Madrid.

Paul Clement would I’m sure go with him back to his home city and Arsenal – who seem terrified that if they move Wenger on they will stop qualifying for the Champions League – would have a coach who has won the competition three times.

It all sounds perfect, I don’t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion!

Pete Jenson: In one sense he doesn’t have to adapt that much because this Barca does not play like the old Pep Guardiola, Barca.

We saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play. He has also come through the Ajax school, and Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool don’t exactly play like Harry Basset’s Wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him.

It’s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping, and not ignoring his pal Messi when he is in a better position than him.

Pete Jenson: Immense. Pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season.

The greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like Carles Puyol. He will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader’s performance.

Pete Jenson: No one stays in the job very long. They had 25 managers in the 25 years that Sir Alex Ferguson was at Old Trafford and old habits die hard.

It’s incredible to think that Ancelotti hasn’t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning ‘La Decima’ but he hasn’t and unless they win the league or the Champions League this season there will be a change.

Zidane will almost definitely manage Real Madrid one day. It could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge.

Pete Jenson: Bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward.

Last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four-man midfield as opposed to up-top in the three of a 4-3-3.

He put a decent shift in but if he’s working back he can’t also be on Jordi Alba’s shoulder waiting to pull away.

This is why I still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities.

He also faded last night because the team did – Modric and Kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered.

Pete Jenson: It’s been a long time since I can remember seeing him dive. I think the Premier League cured him of that. And he is also alongside Messi now, and Messi very rarely dives.

But he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down I agree. Look at it from his perspective though, he is up against Ramos and Pepe, both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes; and Pepe enjoys the dramatics too.

So if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game.

Pete Jenson: It was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single-minded as he was at Liverpool.

In the Premier League he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal.

At Barcelona he’s got Neymar on one side, Messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish. But Barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when Alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind.

I’m not sure he’ll score as many goals as he did at Liverpool in one season – but he will score more important ones.
