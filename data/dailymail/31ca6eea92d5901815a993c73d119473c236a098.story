A US Airways flight was forced to make an emergency landing after a dog relieved itself at least twice in the plane's aisle - causing travelers to become sick when they were overwhelmed by the stench.

Flight 598 took off from Los Angeles for Philadelphia on Wednesday - and it seems that the pet, a service dog reportedly named Truffles, couldn't quite wait to reach their destination.

'The full sized dog that's on my 
flight, well it did what dogs do & went to the bathroom when it felt
 like it,' one passenger, Chris Law, tweeted. 'Smack dab in middle of aisle.'

Doggy don't: Truffles, the cause of an emergency landing and much hilarity

Guilty: One passenger snapped this picture of the large dog that relieved itself on a US Airways flight

Another passenger, Steve McCall, told Inside Edition: 'About an hour into the flight, I started
 smelling this terrible smell. I thought it was the family in front of 
me - I have a little eight-month-old and I was like, "That is the worst 
blowout I have ever smelled".

'I look up the aisle way and there's a dog
 pooping right in the middle of the aisle. It's a big dog, three or four
 feet tall or long, and he was just going."

He added: ''It 
wasn't little pieces, it was fully-fledged 
dog-diarrhea.'

Staff desperately tried to clean up the mess, using paper towels, disinfectant and then laying towels on top so that passengers could get by.

But just as the mess was cleaned up, the dog had to go again, passengers said.Â 

Clean up: The plane was forced to stop and a passenger snapped a photo of a crew cleaning inside

'The second time after the dog pooped 
they ran out of paper towels, they didn't have anything else,' McCall said. 'The pilot 
comes on the radio, "Hey, we have a situation in the back, we're going 
to have to emergency land".'

The stink 
was so bad that passengers nearby started 'dry heaving' and vomiting and
 the plane was forced to divert to Kansas City, Missouri, where a 
cleaning crew cleaned up the mess, McCall said.

The plane then took off again and finally arrived in its destination, but some passengers missed their flight connections. One family missed their cruise to Greece, McCall said.

His fellow passenger, Chris Law, snapped images of the dog and updated followers throughout the ordeal on his Twitter page.

'Can't make this up,' he wrote. 'The dog has now s*** 
twice. Plane is emergency landing cuz ppl are getting sick. Hazmat team 
needs to board @USAirways.'

Shock: Another passenger, Steve McCall said the dog's stink was so bad that people were vomiting

The company later responded to him on Twitter, saying: 'Our apologies for your discomfort, Chris.'

There were also apologies from the dog's owner, McCall said.

'She said,"Hey, so sorry, I want to get
 all your addresses so I can give you a Starbucks gift card".' he told Inside Edition, adding: 'This is the most unique flight experience I've ever had.'

MailOnline has contacted US Airways for comment. US Airways told Inside Edition that the animal was a service dog.
