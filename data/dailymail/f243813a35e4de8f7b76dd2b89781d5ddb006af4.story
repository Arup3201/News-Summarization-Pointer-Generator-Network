Click here to read Nasser Hussain's thoughts on the tragic death of Phillip Hughes and cricket's reaction 

We’re all shocked by the news of Phillip Hughes’s death. Sport can be dangerous, but it’s not supposed to end like this. You just can’t make any sense out of it. I’m just desperately sad for Hughes’s family and friends, and for the whole of Australian cricket.

I hope the feelings of the lad who bowled the ball, Sean Abbott, aren’t forgotten. I’m sure he won’t be – there’s a good support network around players these days. But it will be a hard thing for him to come back from.

I remember the incident with Peter Lever and Ewen Chatfield during a Test in Auckland in 1975.

Phillip Hughes's death was shocking and tragic, after he was hit on the head by a bouncer this week

It was at the end of an Ashes series in which me and the other England batsmen had taken a terrible pounding at the hands of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, and I’d gone home before the New Zealand leg of the tour.

But Peter, who was a team-mate of mine at Lancashire, had hit Chatfield on the head in the days before helmets. Chatfield collapsed and swallowed his tongue.

He had to be resuscitated by the England physio Bernie Thomas, who said his heart had briefly stopped beating. Technically, I suppose you could say he was dead for a few moments.

Mercifully for everyone, Ewen pulled through, but I always felt Peter was never the same bowler after that. He was a thoughtful chap, and the fact that Chatfield came so close to dying was tough for him to deal with.

The Australian Cricketers' Association said they were monitoring Abbott and would offer support

Next summer during a county match, we were playing on an uncovered pitch – and Peter just didn’t want to bowl. No one blamed him.

He was really suffering, and he still gets asked about it today. He’s still uncomfortable about it now – and Chatfield didn’t even pay the ultimate price.

So just imagine how young Abbott must be feeling. You just hope he doesn’t blame himself.

Batsmen have better protection these days, and I don’t see this as being an issue about the safety of helmets. It was just a freakish accident.

But how, as a bowler, do you deal with something like this? How can you ever love the game again? My heart goes out to Sean Abbott.
