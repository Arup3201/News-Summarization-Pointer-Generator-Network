Playing on public paranoia ignited by movies like The Exorcist, British military intelligence agents spread rumours of demonic possessions, black masses and witchcraft to scare emerging armed groups in the Troubles in the 1970s, it has been revealed.

The head of the army's 'black operations', in Northern Ireland, Captain Colin Wallace, was said to have stoked satanic panic between 1972-1974, going so far as to place black candles and upside down crucifixes in abandoned buildings in Belfast war zones.

The move was all part of a propaganda spreading plan to link the true-to-life horrors happening at the hands of  paramilitary groups with supernatural evil depicted in horror films.

Professor Richard Jenkins, of Sheffield University, has revealed the use of the dark arts as part of a physiological war in his book, Black Magic and Bogeyman: fear, Rumour and Popular Belief in the North of Ireland 1972-1974.

He wrote that intelligence agents leaked stories to newspapers about black masses and satanic rituals taking place from the north of Belfast to the east.

The agents stoked public fears, ignited by films like The Exorcist and The Devil Rides Out. 

Mr Wallace told Mr Jenkins by fanning devil-worshipping paranoia among the public, agents made people believe emerging forces and their murderous campaigns were fueled by evil forces, and were possibly interlinked.  

Mr Wallace said promoting the idea that the devil was at play was a good way to discredit paramilitary organisations. It also helped keep children inside at night, and away from buildings they were using to conduct surveillance. 

The bloodiest years of the Troubles were between 1972-1974, when Northern Ireland almost erupted into civil war  and when Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups began ritualistic-style torture killings

He told The Guardian: 'It was quite clear that the church, both the Roman Catholic church and the Protestant church, even for the paramilitaries, held a fair degree of influence.

 'So we were looking for something that would be regarded with abhorrence really by the two communities, and at the same time would be something that paramilitaries couldn't justify, and also would be in many ways seen as a reason why some of the outrages were taking place.

'That sort of degree of activity was lowering the value of human life. And so eventually it came to the point where we looked at witchcraft … Ireland was very superstitious and all we had to do was bring it up to date.' 

Jenkins, a professor of sociology, said Mr Wallace's own religious upbringing and cultural background were behind the ideas.

The bloodiest years of the Troubles were between 1972-1974, when Northern Ireland almost erupted into civil war. And when Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups began ritualistic-style torture killings of Catholics and political opponents.

The best known of these gruesome murders, was the killing of Paddy Wilson and his friend Irene Andrews in 1973.
