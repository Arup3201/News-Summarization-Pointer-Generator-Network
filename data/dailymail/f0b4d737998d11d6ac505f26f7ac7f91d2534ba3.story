You might think that predicting the weather correctly is a fairly basic requirement for a forecaster.

But at the Met Office, getting it right is apparently such a shock that its staff have had to be rewarded – with almost £1million in bonuses.

Figures released today show forecasters have shared a huge windfall after they met accuracy targets for public forecasts and weather warnings last year.

Met Office staff have been handed £1million in bonuses for meeting accuracy targets for public forecasts

The weathermen and women have, however, been accused of a series of high profile blunders in the past, leaving critics to question whether they really deserve a bonus for just doing their job.

In total last year the Met Office handed staff £2.7million, with £942,000 of this given for meeting accuracy targets.

This is the highest amount paid to staff in bonuses for correctly predicting the weather compared with each of the past five years.

Forecasters achieved this with the aid of a new ‘supercomputer’, which costs £8million a year to help with predictions.

The Met Office’s chief executive John Hirst was last year paid a total of £185,000, which included a bonus payment of £20,000 – although he took a voluntary pay cut in April last year when his contract was extended.

Almost 2,000 staff at the organisation were also given a £346 bonus in their wages as a congratulations for hitting their weather forecast accuracy targets.

Critics are unhappy that the Met Office (based in Exeter, above) is rewarding staff despite them not providing the public with long-range forecasts any more

Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Given the amount of times that the Met Office has been left with egg on its face it is time it stopped worrying about bonuses and focused on getting its forecasts right.’

Critics are also unhappy that the Met Office is rewarding staff despite them not providing the public with long-range forecasts any more.

The 90-day forecasts were shortened to 30 days after the 2009 ‘barbecue summer’ fiasco.

Jonathan Powell, of independent forecaster Positive Weather Solutions, said it was ‘totally irresponsible of the Met Office not to offer the public long-range forecasts in order not to be seen as getting it wrong’.

The Met Office said it discontinued long range forecasts following research showing the public find shorter forecasts of more use.

A Met Office spokesman added: ‘For the last financial year the Met Office met all of its forecast accuracy targets as our public forecasts and weather warnings helped the UK prepare for everything from London 2012, to the wettest year in a century, to widespread snowfall in January.

‘We are consistently ranked in the top two most accurate forecasters in the world by the World Meteorological Organisation and our forecast targets each year help us build on that world leading capability.’
