Aston Villa defender Chris Herd is set to go on loan to Championship side Wigan for the rest of the season.

Malky Mackay wants to add the Australian international to his squad and is close to completing a deal.

Herd, 25, a Villa academy graduate, has not played for Paul Lambert since December 2013 and his contract expires this summer.

Malky Mackay is keen on bolstering his side's defence before the end of the January transfer window

He can play right back, centre back and in midfield, and spent a short spell on loan at Bolton earlier this season, playing three games.

Mackay is struggling at Wigan, winning only one of his 11 games in charge. 

The Latics lost at home to Huddersfield on Saturday and are 23rd in the Championship, five points from safety. 

Herd was forced into returning home from the Asian Cup earlier than expected after damaging his achilles.
