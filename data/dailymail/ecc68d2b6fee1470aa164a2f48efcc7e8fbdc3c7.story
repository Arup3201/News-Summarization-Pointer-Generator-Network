A mother has slammed her son's Texas middle school for including a question about infidelity in his homework.

Patricia Galvan, who helps her 12-year-old son with his school work every night, said she was shocked when she looked over the seventh-grader's science assignment.

On a worksheet about genetics, one question read:

'One of Opal's children is born with shocking red hair. Is Orville the father of this child? But wait, Opal swear she has been faithful and claims that the hospital goofed and got her baby mixed with another. Is this a plausible explanation?'

Not happy: Patricia Galvan said she was shocked when her son's seventh-grade science homework included a question about infidelity. Another assignment asked him to set up a fake Match.com profile, she said

'Inappropriate': The genetics question suggested that the mother of a newborn child had had an affair

The question left her 'appalled', Galvan told WTVR.

'I was very bothered by it,' she said. 'I'm now having to explain to my child about being unfaithful - why do I have to explain that to my 12-year-old?'

The boy, who attends Harry F. Byrd Middle School in Henrico, was also given a Social Studies assignment in which he had to study a character from the 1920s and then go 'speed dating' with other class members.

As part of the assignment, he also needed to create a Match.com page for the person.

'To even research what is Match.com, that opens up a whole other thing,' his mother complained.  

Apology: A spokesperson for Harry F. Byrd Middle School agreed the assignment should be changed

A spokesman from Henrico County Public Schools told WTVR that they 'agreed that some of the wording was not appropriate for the classroom'.

'We are thankful that the parent brought the issue to our attention, and we will be working to provide additional reminders that ensure all instructional materials are age-appropriate,' they said.
