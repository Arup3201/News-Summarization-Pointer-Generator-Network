Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey handed Arsenal a 2-0 win away in Monaco, but it wasn't enough as Arsene Wenger's side crashed out of the Champions League.

French striker Giroud struck in the first half to give travelling Arsenal fans a glimmer of hope at the Stade Louis II before Ramsey grabbed a second.

However, a resilient Monaco defence refused to let in another and the French side progressed to the next round on the away goals rule.

Sportsmail's Rob Draper was at the game to give the lowdown in France...

Arsenal

David Ospina 6

So little to do, the Colombian effectively took the evening off for much of the game.

Hector Bellerin 5.5

Loves to get forward, can’t be faulted in his running. But still partial to panicky moments in his own penalty area.

Per Mertesacker 6

In control, assured. A different player altogether to the man who fell apart in the first leg. 

Laurent Koscielny 6.5

Almost opened the scoring with a prod on to the bat from very close range. Had less to do at the back.

Nacho Monreal 5.5

Pushed on, got forward, but his delivery on the cross lets him down at times and was exposed at times.

Francis Coquelin 6.5

Taking his enforcer role to heart. Twice he crunched Joao Moutinho in half in the first half but avoided a yellow card.

Santi Cazorla 6.5

Adequate but not quite the little magician that you were expecting given that he has been Arsenal’s best player of late.

Alexis Sanchez 5.5

Strangely lackadaisical in his passing which almost let in Monaco in the eighth minute. Booked – harshly – for a dive. His energy was impressive as ever.

Mesut Ozil 7

Never stopped trying to create, always looking for the killer pass – had an extremely organised Monaco midfield with which he had to contend.

Danny Welbeck 7

A veritable bundle of energy, driving into the Monaco penalty area. His pass set up Giroud’s goal. Came off on 71 minutes as influence faded. 

Olivier Giroud 7.5

Really excellent finish to open the scoring. His reaction and poise once the ball bounced off his head was superb. Redemptive after the first game.

Subs

Aaron Ramsey (for Coquelin 62) 7 - Fine reaction and finish when Kurzawa inexplicably gave the ball to him on 79 minutes.

Walcott (for Welbeck 72) 6

Gibbs (for Monreal 82) 6

Manager

Arsene Wenger 7

Game plan was assured, defence was solid and they gave themselves the chance. It did beg the question why they couldn’t have done that in the first leg? 

Monaco

Danijel Subasic 8

Solid taking crosses and produced good saves, notably from Ozil’s second half free-kick. Unfortunate for Giroud’s goal.

Fabinho 5

Struggled to maintain composure at times as Arsenal poured forward. A difficult night.

Aymen Abdennour 6.5

Was the leader at the back, forever cajoling and generally anticipating much of Arsenal’s attacking intent. 

Wallace 6

Preferred to the much more experienced Ricardo Carvalho and didn’t let his side down.

Layvin Kurzawa 4

Looked vulnerable, especially when Welbeck switched to the right. Dreadful error giving the ball away for the second goal.

Geoffrey Kondogbia 7.5

Fought, tackled and ran. Did as much anyone to secure Monaco’s passage to the quarters. 

Jeremy Toulalon 7

Composed, robust, provided leadership, especially in those tricky final few minutes.

Nabil Dirar 7.5

Remained a threat even with Monaco camped in their own half. Terrific speed and desire.

Joao Moutinho 6.5

Not as influential as the first leg but still fulfilled his duties and brought composure when necessary.

Anthony Martial 5

Strugled to make an impact and taken of on 59 minutes.

Dimitar Berbatov 7

The touches were just as exquisite as always; did what he does and then departed after 76 minutes to make way for younger, fitter men.

Subs

Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco (for Martial 59) 7

Bernado Silva (For Berbatov 76) 6

Nabil Dirar (for Edelson 85) 6

Manager

Leonardo Jardim 7.5

So they lost 2-0 – but over two legs Jardim has been masterful. Even last night his team were superbly set up.

Ref

Svein Oddvar Moen 6

Perhaps harsh on booking Alexis Sanchez for diving; otherwise avoided major controversy for the most part and refereed sensibly.
