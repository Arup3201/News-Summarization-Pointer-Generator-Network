'Scaremongering': Ed Miliband has been accused of misleading voters with 'NHS letter'

Ed Miliband has been accused of misleading voters after Labour sent out letters made to look like they were from a hospital or GP surgery.

Many were left upset by the mail, which could easily be mistaken for test results or notification of changes in local NHS provision.

The letters come in envelopes saying that they contain important information about the NHS. It is only when people read the contents that they realise it is a message from the Labour leader.

Mr Miliband has been condemned as ‘cruel’ and ‘insensitive’ after sending the letters to people including hospital patients, the elderly and families of the recently deceased.

Opponents have accused him of scare tactics and claim it is further evidence of his campaign to ‘weaponise’ the NHS ahead of the general election.

Across the top of the envelope is the message: ‘Important information about the future of local NHS services.’ 

The only clue as to its real contents is small print on the reverse that says it should be returned to ‘Labour Central’ at an address in Newcastle if undelivered.

In the letter, Mr Miliband writes about the ‘challenges facing your local hospital’ and warns that ‘services here are struggling’. 

Despite the claim that it concerns the future of ‘local NHS services’, exactly the same message is being sent to homes across the country.

One was addressed to a woman in Southampton who died from cancer six months ago, aged 72.

Her husband, 76, had asked for her name to be taken off the electoral roll – which is commonly used by political parties and companies for mailshots – so he assumed it was from the hospital that treated her. The man, a lifelong Labour voter and former docker, was left in tears when he realised his mistake.

His daughter Kerry Haynes, 51, branded Mr Miliband ‘cruel’ for the ‘deliberate deception’ and added: ‘I go round every day, and when I arrived Dad was crying. 

'The poor man had to read the letter four or five times to work out that all it was asking for was his vote. 

'If he’d thought it was junk mail he would not have opened it, but as it was addressed to my mum and made to look like it was from the hospital he was really upset.’

Misleading: Across the top of the envelope is the message: ‘Important information about the future of local NHS services,' and recipients only find out the letter's true message once they have opened it

Another the recipients was Sylvia Knight, 39, from Cambridge, who mistook the letter for information about a hospital appointment she is waiting for.

Her partner Sarah Brown said: ‘Sylvia is an outpatient with the local health service. The letter came and it looked like it was something official from the hospital. She did not realise it was something political until she opened it.

‘It’s a bit freaky. They don’t know who they are sending these letters to and what these people are going through. If someone was having treatment for cancer, it could be quite unnerving.’

Another recipient, in Middlesex, said: ‘I’m sure there will be people desperate for test results or appointments who will be opening the letter thinking they’ve got the information they’ve been waiting for.’

Tory MP Robert Jenrick, who is on the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Ed Miliband has said he wants to weaponise the NHS and now we can see how far Labour will sink in their attempt to spread fear.

‘Desperate moves like this show what little regard Labour have for the public and why Ed Miliband isn’t up to the job of being Prime Minister.’

Mary Macleod, Tory MP for Brentford and Isleworth, said the Labour leader was ‘scaremongering’.

She added: ‘I was shocked to see my constituents receiving this misleading political rubbish from Ed Miliband. Not only can the letter be mistaken for important information from the NHS but inside is just a missive of pure inaccuracy.’

Mr Miliband’s spokesman said: ‘The letter makes clear it’s from the Labour Party. The future of our NHS is incredibly important.'
