Parents have complained after Detroit eighth graders were asked to write an essay about whether they would prefer to be a slave or a factory worker during the Industrial Revolution.

Kaya James, an eighth grade student at Novi Middle School, said she was offended at the question posed during her history class.

She was also concerned that most of her classmates said they'd rather be slaves than factory workers.

Offended: Kaya James, 13, was upset when asked in class to write an essay about whether she'd prefer to be a slave or a factory worker

'I was disappointed because what slaves went through is really humongous and for them to say they would rather be a slave is really disappointing' Kaya told ABC7.

Kaya came home upset, offended and nearly in tears, her mother Tina James told CBS Detroit.

James said she doesn't think students are being taught enough about the true history of slavery if they're willing to make such a choice.

'I just don't think they are being taught slavery in its entirety,' Tina James told ABC7.

Seeking change: Tina James has met with the school district superintendent and the school principal to discuss the way Novi Middle School teaches history to its students

'If you fully understood the psychological aspects of being a slave you would never choose it.'

Tina James called her daughter's school after speaking with other parents who shared her concerns about the controversial essay question.

The Novi Community Schools superintendent Steve Matthews said the question was based on on a Michigan Content Expection, in which eighth grade studets are asked to explain the differences between the lives of free black people, free white people and enslaved people but has now been removed from the curriculum.

'What it suggests to me as a district, we need to do a better job of helping our students understand the devastating impacts of slavery back in the 1800s,' said Matthews.

Change: Novi Middle School has removed the question from its curriculum and is seeking to restructure the way slavery is taught

Keen student: Kaya James says history is her favorite subject

He added that the school is looking at changing the way the history of slavery in the U.S. is being taught at the school.

Kaya James, who hopes to be an attorney when she's older, said she's glad that she raised the issue and hopes her input will help change the way history is taught at her school.

'I don't want anything to be centered around my teacher because I really like him and I think he's a great teacher,' she told ABC7.Â  'The school is a great school... it's just that question is really offensive and it's disappointing what the responses were.'

Superintendent Matthews says he plans to include Tina James in discussions about how to change the school's history curriculum.

'We have children that have impressionable minds and I want to make sure that the impressions that we leave on them are accurate and truthful and honest,' James said.
