Just when we thought Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart were tearing it up in Las Vegas, we’ve unearthed the picture which suggests it may be a little more sedate affair.

For keeping watch over his England team-mates and their pool-party antics is none other than James Milner.

Yes, the man who has a Twitter parody account – Boring James Milner – is on holiday in Sin City with Arsenal midfielder Wilshere and Manchester City pal Hart.

But while that pair appear to drink alcohol and Wilshere smokes and Hart performs an ‘elbow drop’ into the pool, Milner looks on with relative indifference.

Indeed, the 28-year-old Yorkshireman is long gone by the time his Three Lions comrades are snapped surrounded by bikini-clad girls and pose for pictures with other revellers.

The three are due back in training with their club sides later this month having been part of the England squad which crashed out at the group stage in Brazil.

But this is the second time in a year that Wilshere has been pictured with a cigarette.

After being caught in October a few days ahead of an Arsenal match, he insisted: ‘I am not a smoker.’

But manager Arsene Wenger gave Wilshere, 22, a public dressing down, saying: ‘I disagree completely with that behaviour. When you are a football player you are a role model and you don’t do what damages your health.

‘You can damage your health at home, you can drink at home, you can smoke at home and nobody sees it. But when you go out socially, you can damage your reputation as an example.’

Wilshere’s representatives had originally claimed the midfielder was dared to hold the cigarette as a joke.

But he later admitted: ‘Players make mistakes. I am not a smoker. I spoke with the boss and he asked me what happened, I explained to him and we sorted it out. It is not an issue I expect to come back. As I said, I am not a smoker so I think that will be my last one.’
