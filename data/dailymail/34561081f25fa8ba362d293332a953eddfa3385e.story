More than 160 people were forced to exit a plane using its emergency slides after the cabin filled with smoke.

Six crew members and 158 passengers were rescued from the American Airlines flight at Denver International Airport around midday yesterday.  

They had flown on Flight 445 from Charlotte, North Carolina, and had been taxiing to the gate for less than a minute when the captain ordered that the chutes be activated.

More than 160 people were forced to exit American Airlines Flight 445 using its emergency slides after the cabin filled with smoke at Denver International Airport around midday on Wednesday

A bus took the passengers to the terminal, where they waited for two hours for their baggage. 

One minor injury was reported. It is thought the person slipped on ice. 

Passenger Andy Long said he noticed a smell like an emergency brake being left on in a running car and then saw the cabin fill with a light haze. 

He said: 'That's when they said "Everybody get out, get out, get out. Don't take your stuff."' 

'There was probably an appropriate amount of people being generally frustrated because their days got rained on.' 

He wrote on Instagram after the incident that he can now tick using an emergency plane exit off his bucket list. 

Another passenger, Lindsay Geisler, said that passengers waited for 20 minutes for a bus.

She added: 'It's been great to see how people rally together and help out one another when you get put into a situation like this.'

Greg Pixley, spokesman for the Denver Fire Department, said the smoke had been contained.

'There was smoke coming out of the wall. What caused it was contained to that one area,' he told the Denver Post.   

A spokesman for the airport said there was no sign of a fire inside the plane.

A spokesman for American Airlines said: 'While taxiing to the gate, the pilot was alerted to possible smoke in the cabin. The passengers and crew deplaned via the slides and are all in the terminal.

'We are in contact with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration.'
