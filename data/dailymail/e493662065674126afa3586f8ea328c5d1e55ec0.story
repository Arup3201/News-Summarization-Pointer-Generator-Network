Busted: Kelli Knutson, left, and Logan Jackson, right, were arrested on Sunday after they were caught having sex in a car right near a jail 

Lewis wrote that 'Officers responded to the front of the jail and found the couple still actively engaged.'

Eugene residents Kelli Knutson and Logan Jackson were stopped by police and face Indecent Exposure and Disorderly Conduct II charges, Lewis wrote.

Police took the 33-year-old Jackson to the nearby Springfield Municipal Jail. 24-year-old Knutson went to Lane County Jail, he said.

Before they were arrested, they went to a nearby strip club called The Brick House, Sgt. Rich Charboneau told KVAL.

He told the news outlet the couple exited the strip club and went to their car on the other side of the street to have sex.

Too convenient: Jackson was arrested and taken to the Springfield Municipal Jail ... which was immediately near where he and Knutson had sex in the parked vehicle 

Charboneau told KVAL 'Apparently it ended soon after they knocked on the window. They were very cooperative, yes.'

'The main thing is to make sure that the woman is not being taken advantage of for the male the I guess,' he told the affiliate station.

Charboneau also told KVAL 'We'd normally tell them to go someplace that's safer than a parking lot, or wherever we might find them. In this case, we had traffic being slowed down, we had someone complaining about it, and so we had to take action.'
