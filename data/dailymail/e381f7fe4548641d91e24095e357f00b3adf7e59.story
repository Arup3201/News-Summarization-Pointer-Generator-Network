Thousands of Australians scored illegal drugs from a website run like eBay, where they could check out reviews on dope, meth, ecstasy and cocaine and order their highs through the post at a quarter of the street price.

A 30-year-old Texan man named Ross Ulbricht is alleged by the FBI to have created the website and to have run it from a Bondi apartment in Sydney for the first six months, but he has plead not guilty to the charges against him.

Lawyer turned journalist Eileen Ormsby, from Melbourne, began investigating online drug supermarket Silk Road in 2011 after a woman she met at a party told her how easy it was to buy drugs from it.

Despite it being a global website, reportedly founded in the US, ‘Australian users were definitely over represented because there were higher quality drugs on there,’ Ms Ormsby told Daily Mail Australia.

‘The drugs were also much, much cheaper than in Australia,’ she explained. 'The most popular drug was MDMA. A gram is $300 on the street but only $80 online.' 

Silk Road, which has since been shut down by the FBI, was an online black market and part of the Deep Web that it operated as a Tor hidden service, meaning online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without being detected by authorities.

The journalist began hanging out on the site’s online forums, which you could access by downloading tor software to your computer and by trading in the online currency Bitcoin, and spoke with many users of the site.

‘The online forums were very busy and there were a lot of Australians. I was gobsmacked that it existed or that it worked,’ she said.

Ms Ormsby was also shocked at the type of people she met on the website. ‘They came across as quite intelligent and engaged, then I got interested in the whole business model and how it was so openly advertised on forums like Reddit,’ she explained.

Mr Ulbricht was arrested by the FBI in 2013 and will go on trial on January 5 in New York

As well as people looking to buy drugs, Ms Ormsby also spoke with the in-house doctor for the website that was there to provide advice.

‘He’s just interested in harm reduction and giving realistic advice about drugs. There is no point in just saying “don’t do it” to people who are already using,’ she reasoned.

Ms Ormsby had correspondence with a person who created the website who goes by the pseudonym of Dread Pirate Roberts.

Mr Ulbricht allegedly wanted to create a Utopian market place and during the site’s early stages he lived in Bondi.

The 30-year-old will go on trial on January 5 charged with conspiracy to narcotics trafficking; computer hacking; money laundering; engaging in a criminal enterprise; and conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent IDs. He was taken into custody by federal agents at a San Francisco public library in 2013.

But his family and friends believe he is falsely accused and innocent of the charges. He has also pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Ms Ormsby spoke to Dread Pirate Roberts by private direct messages online.

‘We had lots of private messages. He tended to be fairly guarded but he was always polite and he really believed in what he was doing.

‘By all accounts he lived very simply considering he allegedly had nearly one hundred million dollars in Bitcoin,’ Ms Ormsby said.

Silk Road had over a million registered users by the time it was shut down and Ms Ormsby believes it provided a safer alternative for people to buy drugs than on the streets.

‘Obviously it’s impossible to have any form of violence taking part online. There is also quality control because people get rated out of five just like on eBay,’ she explained.

‘There were people doing independent testing of all the drugs so you know what you are getting, not like the so called legal highs that are mimicking the real drugs and getting sold in nightclubs.’

Although people did still get ripped off on the site, it was run in an organised way were people would sign up and advertise their wares for sale.

Despite Silk Road being shut down on 6 November 2013 Silk Road 2.0 came online soon after

Users would come online and search for what they wanted, for example ecstasy pills, and pop it in their online baskets.

‘The money would go into the site until the user had received their drugs in the post,’ Ms Ormsby said.

Despite Silk Road being shut down on 6 November 2013 Silk Road 2.0 came online, said to be run by former administrators of Silk Road.

It was also closed on 6 November 2014 but at least 20 more similar sites are available for drug users.

Ms Ormsby doesn’t believe authorities will ever really be able to control them.

‘There is a whole move to decentralise the markets and purely online currency is being used more and more,’ she said.
