Stepping down: Evelynn Hammonds (pictured) has resigned from her role as dean at Harvard University

A top Harvard University dean has resigned from her post after facing backlash for authorizing email searches during a college cheating scandal.

Evelynn Hammonds was widely criticized for authorizing two email accounts of a resident dean to be searched during an investigation of a leak to the media about the scandal.

Hammonds was accused of breaking campus privacy rules and Harvard President Drew Faust said 'different choices should have been made' while handing the matter, The Boston Globe reported.

In her defense, 
Hammonds said at a faculty meeting that she undertook the email search 
to protect the names of the students suspected of cheating last August.

She wanted to find the leak to the media within the faculty so the students' names would not be made public.

The top 
administrator, who had been a dean at Harvard for five years, will 
return to a teaching role at the university after stepping down from her
leadership role.

She
will teach and research History of Science and African and African 
American Studies department, and will take over a new study of race and 
gender in science and medicine at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for 
African and African American Research.

When
the university announced her departure from her leadership post, which 
will take affect on July 1 after a sabbatical, it praised her 
achievements and leadership.

President
Fraust said in a statement: 'She has fully invested herself in 
improving the experience of our undergraduates both inside and outside 
the classroom, and in promoting a culture of inclusion and community 
across the College.

'I'm
grateful to her for all she has done to help our undergraduates thrive 
and we will be fortunate to continue benefiting from her talents and 
wisdom.'

Hammonds
said in her statement: 'Being dean of Harvard College has been an 
immensely rewarding experience for me, but I miss engaging deeply with 
my scholarship and teaching.

'I
am looking forward to redesigning my classes in light of new 
technologies and modes of teaching and I'm eager to return to my 
teaching ad research on race, genomics and gender in science and 
medicine.'

During the cheating scandal last fall, Harvard University administrators secretly searched the 
emails of 16 deans, looking for a mole who leaked information about a cheating scandal that rocked the Ivy League college.

Cheats: The Spring 2012 'Introduction to Congress' had an enrollment of 279 and nearly half those students faced some kind of investigation in the case

Deans
on the Administrative Board of the college in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
who were tasked with investigating the cheating claims, were all 
secretly targeted.

Last
year news leaked to the media that up to 125 students of politics had 
been involved in widespread cheating at the respected school.

They were discovered when a 
teaching assistant detected issues with a take-home test on the subject 
of Congress.

It appeared 
students had shared answers - something expressly forbidden on take home
tests at America's oldest higher education institution.

In February, Harvard 
said it had dealt with the issue by taking academic sanctions against 60
students - some of whom were temporarily suspended.

Administrative accounts of all the deans on the board were searched without any prior warning.

IT
officials were told to only search subject headers and not read the 
content of emails but the secretive process still came under fire among 
academic staff at the school.

Harvard spokesman 
Jeff Neal said: 'Any assertion that Harvard routinely monitors emails - 
for any reason - is patently false,' he said in an email.

Michael
Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said the college
would always take ' necessary and appropriate action' if the Administrative 
Board process was believed to be compromised.

'If circumstances were to arise that gave reason to 
believe that the Administrative Board process might have been 
compromised, then Harvard College would take all necessary and 
appropriate actions under our procedures to safeguard the integrity of 
that process, which is designed to protect the rights of our students to
privacy and due process.'

Sharon
Howell, Harvard's senior resident dean, said they owed the deans an apology.

Congressional oversight: The students were said to have conferred on answers to the take home test. Something expressly forbidden at the school

'They don't seem to think they've done anything wrong,' she told the Globe.

The cheating first came up last August.

Students had 
apparently conversed via email and through other channels about how to 
answer questions on the exam in
violation of the school's no-collaboration policy.

The class was widely considered an 
easy one, however Harvard's rules state that unless specifically told 
they can collaborate, no student may confer with another on take-home 
exams.

At the 
time Smith said the case that attracted negative publicity to the 
venerated research institution reflected on it as a whole.

'[The
investigation] never was, as some have mistakenly assumed, to shine a 
bright light on any student or other member of our community,' he wrote.
'Let me be crystal clear: we all can do better.'

The Globe said in March that the dean who had leaked the information had been discovered in the email search but was not punished.

It is believed they forwarded a memo on the cheating scandal to a student rather than directly to the media.
