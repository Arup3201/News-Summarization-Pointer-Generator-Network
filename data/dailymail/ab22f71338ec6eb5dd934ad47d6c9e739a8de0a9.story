Call centre staff working for Lloyds Banking Group were told to 'play the system' and mislead customers who contacted them with complaints about being mis-sold payment protection insurance.

An undercover investigation at the group's largest PPI complaint handling centre at Royal Mint Court in London discovered that staff were told to ignore fraud and assume that PPI was never mis-sold.

Workers were also allegedly coached on how to forge information onto customers' loan agreements and some were advised that customers would drop their complaint after being rejected.

The latest scandal to hit the bank was unveiled after an undercover reporter from the Times newspaper went through the recruitment and training system.

Call centre staff working for Lloyds were found to be forging information relating to customers' PPI complaints

A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group conceded that there were 'issues' with the way it dealt with the scandal and said that it terminated its contract with Deloitte which operated the complaint handling centre on its behalf.

'Earlier this year we became aware of 
issues at a PPI complaints handling centre called Royal Mint Court in 
central London, ' the spokesman said.

'This
 site was operated for us by a third party supplier, Deloitte. Following
 further investigations, we took immediate action, and in May concluded 
our contract with Deloitte and moved to a new supplier.

Lloyds said the comments of trainers to an undercover reporter 'do not reflect' the banks standards or policies

'Some of the comments made by trainers to The Times reporter are not endorsed by Lloyds Banking Group and we believe they do not reflect our high training standards or our policies.

'We believe the comments to be isolated and they are now being addressed.

'Following the discovery of these 
issues, and under the guidance of a new supplier, the employees are 
currently undergoing re-training in line with our policies and 
procedures.'

A spokesman for Deloitte said: 'Deloitte’s role was to process PPI mis-selling complaints from Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) customers who were sold policies by the bank, in accordance with the bank’s policies and procedures.

'We cannot, however, comment upon the specifics of this matter due to reasons of client confidentiality.'

City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it is aware of the issues raised by The Times and it has been working with Lloyds since earlier this year to ensure they are resolved and customers' interests are properly considered.

The FCA has previously said that it was looking into PPI firms' complaint-handling procedures and it plans to publish its findings later this summer.

A statement from the FCA said: 'We expect all firms to comply with our rules and treat their customers fairly.

'Firms know that PPI complaints must be thoroughly investigated and that appropriate action, where required, is taken promptly.

'Our rules are very clear that firms are expected to learn from previous complaints. So if there are significant numbers of complaints coming in about the same thing, that is a clear warning sign that something isn't right.'

PPI is the most complained-about 
product the Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes between
 consumers and financial firms, has ever seen.

It has criticised banks and insurers 
for subjecting customers to 'delays and inconvenience' and has had to 
deal with record numbers of complaints over the last year, which have 
mainly been driven by the PPI scandal.

People paid 
PPI on loans they received from many high street banks including Lloyds.

The payment was optional but it was found that it may have been 
mis-sold because customers may never have wanted it, they were 
ineligible because they were self-employed or they simply could not 
afford it.

Customers complained to Lloyds for compensation but were dealt with by Royal Court Mint.

The latest issue is that staff were allegedly told to ignore risk of fraud, reject 
complaints because 90 per cent of customers did not appeal, or to deal with complaint 
even if documents are missing.

Of those who did go on to appeal, 84 per cent of complaints were upheld while just 16 per cent were rejected.

Lloyds said that it had terminated its contract with Deloitte which operated the complaint handling centre on its behalf

PPI
 covers repayments on credit cards and loans if the holder loses his or 
her job or is unable to work due to an accident or illness.

To
 date Lloyds Banking Group has set aside a total of £6.7 billion for PPI
 redress and paid out more than £4.3 billion to 1.3 million customers.

Earlier
 this year disgraced former Lloyds boss Eric Daniels launched an 
astonishing attack on the bank's customers, blaming bogus PPI claims for
 pushing up the compensation bill.

Daniels – who is widely blamed for 
steering Lloyds to the brink of collapse in 2008 – said up to half of 
claims on payment protection insurance policies were 'completely 
illegitimate'.

In a rare public appearance since retiring from the bailed-out bank almost two years ago, the American also insisted that the bank carried out 'good due diligence' on its disastrous takeover of HBOS during the financial crisis.

He told the banking commission of MPs and peers he was 'deeply regretful' about customers  who were genuine victims of mis-selling, but blamed dishonest claimants for pushing up the compensation bill.

And he offered no apology for the debacle, claiming PPI was 'good value for money'. He said: 'In the great majority of cases customers received a good sales process, and received a product that suited them.'

However, his predecessor Antonio Horta-Osario went on to describe PPI mis-selling as 'unacceptable' becoming the first bank chief executive to apologise.

The bank was fined £4.3million in February after the Financial Services Authority found it was not paying victims swiftly enough.

There was one complaint every six seconds about PPI mis-selling by high street banks last year

Two million customers fed up at poor treatment from banks and insurers took their cases to the Financial Ombudsman in the past year –  a rate of one every six seconds.

The service went on to investigate a record 500,000 complaints and ordered payouts to nearly 250,000 consumers.

Of those complaints taken up by the Ombudsman in the financial year to April, 378,699 were about payment protection insurance. This figure was double that of the previous 12 months, according to its annual review.

Chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said dissatisfaction had hit 'record levels'.

'People are becoming more aware of their rights and less willing to put up with poor customer service,' she said.

'Too many financial businesses still seem unable to sort out problems themselves, without the Ombudsman  having to get involved.'

The high volume of complaints about PPI suggests banks are failing to clear a backlog which has built up over several years.

They are struggling to process refunds for millions of consumers mis-sold policies they did not need alongside loans and credit cards.

The scandal has led to an estimated bill of £15billion for lenders after they were ordered in 2010 to pay back premiums.

The Ombudsman settles disputes between firms and customers, and a complaint would reach officials only after being rejected by a bank.

Its annual report is another setback for banks, which have been mired in scandal since the 2008 credit crunch.

Justin Modray, founder of financial advice website Candid Money, said: 'Financial giants prove time and again they're little more than shady salesmen masquerading as  pillars of society, who routinely reject complaints they're subsequently forced to settle.

'Continued financial mis-selling, coupled with an increasing willingness to complain, means the latest Ombudsman figures are sadly no surprise.

'The regulator needs to get far tougher by nipping bad practices in the bud, rather than relying on the Ombudsman to sort out the mess  further down the line.'

Chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said dissatisfaction with banks had hit 'record levels'

The report also showed a huge rise in the number of pensioners turning to the Ombudsman as a last resort.

The over-65s accounted for a quarter of cases investigated – double the figure for 2011-12.

However, more consumers are side-stepping claims management firms, which typically grab around 25 per cent of any compensation won.

Miss Ceeney said growing numbers were 'realising they don't need to pay someone to make a complaint on  their behalf'.

The Big Four banking groups still dominate complaints. RBS/NatWest, Lloyds Banking Group (including HBOS),  Barclays and HSBC accounted for 62 per cent of  complaints to the service, up from 52 per cent in the previous period.

Leading institutions are still trying to recover from a string of high-profile scandals over the last year.

RBS/NatWest suffered an IT system meltdown which left customers without access to their cash for weeks.

Bankers at Barclays and its rivals were strongly implicated in the interest-rate rigging furore while HSBC was reprimanded for links to money laundering by Mexican drug barons.

A spokesman for the British Bankers Association said: 'All banks have hired more staff to deal with complaints.'

He criticised some 'unscrupulous' claims management firms for referring 'large  numbers of claims to the Ombudsman, whether there are grounds to or not'.

This 'clogs up the system, meaning that people with genuine complaints don't always get the service they deserve'.

If
you are thinking about ditching your bank there are plenty of incentives to move.

This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are.

Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promises new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit.

First Direct pays
 £100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, 
the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a
 further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 
months.

Santander's 123 current account, on the other hand, pays interest on in-credit balances
- 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between 
£2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000.

Nationwide BS FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers free travel insurance.
