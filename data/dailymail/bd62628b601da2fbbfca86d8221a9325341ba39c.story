A new range of underwear has true green credentials - it's made from recycled pine trees. 

It might sound uncomfortable but it doesn't mean the lingerie feels prickly to touch, in fact the makers claim it's 'as soft as silk'.

The collection of knickers comes from Midlands firm Liv.co.uk, who are based near Redditch and describe themselves as an 'ethical' online department store.

Green is the new black: The briefs are made from crushed pine needles but are far from prickly

The 'organic' briefs are made in France and Tunisia by the French lingerie designer Sophie Young. 

As Christmas trees go up this month, the company hope people will think about what happens to them when they come down again and invest in their recycled products.

The glamorous French panties which cost £15 each and are described as 'sexy, seductive underwear, soft as silk with the feel of cashmere and the coolness of linen.'

Tree-mendous: The pine needle fabric is a vicose and the material is described 'structurally similar to cotton'

Fruits of the forest: Despite its origins, the underwear is said to be as 'soft as silk with the feel of cashmere and the coolness of linen'

A spokesman for the company said: 'These are the pinnacle of French technology, delivered right where it matters. They won't leave you pining for the old bloomers.'

Describing the product in more detail, she said: 'The pine needle fabric is a vicose. Like viscose rayon which is a fibre made from regenerated wood cellulose, this fabric is regenerated pine needles.

'Structurally it is similar to cotton, which is almost pure cellulose.'

As well as lingerie, the website also sells other ethically sourced products including homeware and men's and women's clothing.
