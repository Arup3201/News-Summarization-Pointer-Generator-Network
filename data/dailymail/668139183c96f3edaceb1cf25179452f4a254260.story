Overjoyed: Joseph Balku smiles as his 80-foot tall Norway Spruce is cut and raised off the ground, destined for Midtown Manhattan

The Christmas tree that will dominate New York's Rockefeller Center survived the winds of Superstorm Sandy that left a path of destruction in a New Jersey town and even its donor without electricity for weeks.

Joe Balku, 76, learned that the 80-foot Norway spruce had been chosen for the honor four weeks ago. Sandy hit two weeks later

The Mount Olive, New Jersey resident watched the tree, which weighs 10 tons and is 50 feet in diameter, as it swayed in the backyard.

'I kept going outside during the night. I lost two trees, an oak and an evergreen, but the big tree was tied up for its protection,' Balku told the Associated Press.

His electricity went out, but on the morning after the storm, the tree was still standing and his home did not sustain any damage.

The tree was about 22-feet tall when Balku purchased the home in 1973.

Balku had two generators running to power his home in the rural community about an hour from Manhattan. He didn't have cable TV or Internet service.

Electricity was restored on Saturday following the Nor’easter that struck days after Sandy.

The tree will be loaded on a 115-foot-long flatbed truck and erected at Rockefeller Center on Wednesday.

Workers will then string 45,000 lights on the branches.

'It's
a thrill of a lifetime to have the chance to donate the tree to 
Rockefeller Center and for millions of people to see it all over the 
world,' he said.

The
80th Christmas tree lighting will take place on November 28. The 
massive tree has been a popular holiday destination for tourists and New
Yorkers alike. 

The last New Jersey-grown tree was used in 2009, according to The Star-Ledger. That particular tree was a 72-foot tall Norway spruce.
