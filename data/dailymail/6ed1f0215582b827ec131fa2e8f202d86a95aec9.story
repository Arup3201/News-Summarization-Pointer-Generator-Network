The parents of a seven-year-old boy who has already beaten cancer once, are trying to raise £250,000 for further life-saving treatment because the disease has returned.

Jamie Inglis has such an aggressive form of cancer that treatment available in the UK will only keep him alive for a matter of months.

But a specialist has offered his parents John and Vicky a lifeline – a place on a clinical trial in Germany which would improve Jamie’s chance of survival by 75 per cent.

'Incredibly brave': Jamie has already battled neuroblastoma once

The couple has just 33 days to find the cash to take their son abroad or he will lose his place.Mr Inglis, 40, said: 'As a parent, you will jump through every hoop and do absolutely anything for your child.

'Jamie is an incredibly brave boy and he keeps us all strong. He is a happy, bright, energetic kid who is loving, caring and incredible in every way. He deserves a shot at life.'

Mr Inglis, who was an environmental health technician with the Royal Medical Corps for 22 years, quit the Army last year to spend more time with his children - Jamie and sister Poppy, three.

He said: 'I want to spend every moment I have with them. I can’t contemplate life without them.'

A fundraising drive has now been launched to help Jamie get to Germany by August 20. It is being supported by his namesake chef Jamie Oliver who has asked his two million Twitter followers to dig deep.

He said: 'You just look at his parents in admiration and wish them all the very best. Little Jamie is gorgeous beyond belief.'

Mr Inglis said he was hopeful that they would get the money in time but added: 'The demoralising thing about the mission is that this is the second time we have been down this road. It is the second time we have had to ask for money because we can’t get the medical care we need from the NHS.'

Jamie was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when he was four. A hospital ultrasound revealed he had a large tumour in his abdomen and his devastated parents were told he had just a 30 per cent chance of surviving.

But the couple refused to give up and after researching the condition, discovered they could get pioneering treatment in the US which would dramatically improve the odds. But again, it came at a price.

They spent a year fundraising and managed to scrape together the £400,000 they needed to begin the antibody procedure in Philadelphia.

'We never thought it was going to be possible to get that sort of money together,' said Mrs Inglis, 37, at the family home in York.

'What happened was that we received donations from people worldwide and it was truly humbling.'

The treatment in 2010 started with eight courses of chemotherapy, an operation to remove the tumour and a kidney and a ninth high-dose course of chemotherapy designed to kill any remaining cancer cells and wipe out his white blood cells, which fight disease.

Stem cells that had been harvested from his body months earlier were then transplanted back into his body to rejuvenate his immune system before he could begin the actual antibody treatment in the US.

Incredibly the treatment was successful.

Jamie’s hair started to grow back, his smile returned and he even enrolled as a pupil at The Lord Deramore’s Primary School, in Kelfield at the start of 2011.

Mr Inglis, said: 'We were optimistic and with every month that he stayed cancer-free we felt more confident that we had beaten it.'

But four months ago Jamie started to complain about back pain and collapsed at the family home, unable to walk. He was rushed back to hospital and a scan revealed the cancer had returned.

He had emergency surgery to remove a tumour from his spine but after discussions with North Yorkshire and York NHS, the family were told that there was no treatment available in this country to tackle this type of relapse effectively and that they were not eligible for funds to get the treatment abroad.

Mr Inglis said: 'We begged them to help us get the £250,000 we needed to take Jamie to Germany and had the full support of our doctor. It was heartbreaking when we were turned down.

'Unfortunately it means we are having to beg and borrow again. We took a year to get the money we needed when Jamie got sick the first time but this time round we have just four weeks. It is particularly difficult to ask for help a second time round after people have already been so generous but we honestly believe this is our son’s last hope.'

Dr David Geddes, Medical Director for NHS North Yorkshire and York said: 'Our Individual Funding Panel makes decisions about whether to fund treatments that we do not routinely commission.

'The panel, which consists of a range of professionals including doctors, takes into account the clinical and cost effectiveness of such treatments. The panel may decide to fund treatments under exceptional circumstances, depending on the evidence provided in support of the case.

'We have a responsibility to ensure that we provide the best possible healthcare for the largest number of patients within the limited resources available. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able to fund some specialist treatments for which there is limited clinical evidence to support their clinical effectiveness.'

Around 120 children a year in the UK are diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a cancer that forms in nerve tissue.

Jo Dempster-Fowle for Neuroblastoma Alliance UK said: 'We know high-risk neuroblastoma is an incredibly difficult cancer to treat successfully, and no amount of money can secure a successful outcome.

'At present, however, parents see a system that gives up on their children too soon, whilst there should still be hope. Elsewhere such hope is supported by a system that continues to treat children long after the UK has nothing to offer but palliative care.'
