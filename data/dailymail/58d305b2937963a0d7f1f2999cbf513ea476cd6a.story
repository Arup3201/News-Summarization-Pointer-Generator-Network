Early morning in a Manhattan apartment, and a camera shot lingers on discarded underwear on the floor before panning to a sleeping couple in bed, two half-drunk glasses of wine on the table beside them. 

The man rises, dresses, and tiptoes out before pitching up at a photo shoot where he explains to his model friend that he ‘done a little sneak out this morning’. Yes, while the backdrop may be pure Sex And The City, the language in this particular show is rather more The Only Way Is Essex. 

But then that’s not a huge surprise, given that it’s made in exactly the same mould. Following in the sky-high heels of Towie and Made in Chelsea, Taking New York is the latest in ‘constructed reality’ series, this time following a group of twenty-something Brits as they forge new lives amid the skyscrapers of the Big Apple.

And while the architecture might be new – think achingly hip rooftop bars and loft apartments - the content is all too familiar, with squabbles, snogs and slightly contrived friendship dramas the order of the day.

And of course, the cast are universally easy on the eye, not in the least because two of them are models: Jamie, a 23-year-old model from Essex (and the culprit who abandons his date in the first shot of the opening episode), and Sumner, 24, who has previously featured in Britain and Ireland’s Next Top Model. 

Moreover the producers have even managed to nab a couple of achingly pretty blonde identical twins, Amy and Megan Purssey, 26, although in fairness they are also both rather clever too. 

Both speak fluent French and Amy has a History of Art degree under her belt, while her twin studied Mandarin at London’s SOAS. Little wonder, then, that both are anxious to emphasise that in their view, Taking New York is a cut above the average reality show. 

Amy said: ‘Yes it’s a reality show but I hope people will think there’s a little bit more to it as well. The young people in this city are so inspirational and everyone works so hard. You can’t drop the ball. You have to be focused and I think that comes across.’ 

In fact, moving to New York was always Megan’s dream – Amy just got there first after Megan fixed up an internship at a contemporary Chinese art gallery downtown. Two years later, it has turned into a full-time curator role complete with apartment in a fashionable area of Brooklyn with a view of Manhattan’s skyline.

She left her back in Brighton trying to work out how she could join her twin – although we see plenty of her in the show as she visits so often. Amy was the one with the history of art degree, so it was the right thing for her to get that job,’ she said.

‘And us two being twins there’s not a jealous side – I mean as long as one of us wins or comes second that’s what matters.’

Neither had reservations about submitting to the glare of the cameras.

‘To be honest I just thought it sounded like a really good platform for us both,’ said Megan. 

‘Initially it did feel a bit strange being followed around by a film crew but you quickly get used to it and by the end we barely even noticed them.’ 

What, though, about the cringe-worthy prospect of their parents watching their fledgling romances and - whisper it – one night stands unfolding on the small screen. ‘You’ve got to go with it – you can’t be half-hearted when you agree to do a show like this, so it’s warts and all,’ said Megan. 

‘I’m okay with it. My parents were totally ‘‘go for it’’. The only thing that will make them cringe will be if they see their daughters kissing a guy – we’re still their little girls and no parent likes that.’ 

In any event, Amy insists that despite being one half of beautiful British twins they are not overwhelmed with offers. ‘People actually seem to find us a bit intimidating. We are very confident with each other and I think that puts people off so we don’t get approached as much as you might think’.

Self-confessed 'posh' cast member Sophie Pape runs her own events business in New York

Their friend and fellow cast member Sophie Pape, meanwhile, admits she did have reservations about taking part in the show – although she is also similarly defensive. 

Boarding school educated, the 28-year-old self-confessed ‘posh one’ arrived in New York via a few years on women’s magazines in London and now runs her own events business, something she puts down to ‘sheer hard work.’ 

She said: ‘I came with a couple of hundred of dollars and a bag and the offer of a room for a couple of days in the apartment of a friend’s brother. Three years later I’m still there. 

'I’ve worked massively hard to get where I am so obviously I wondered if a reality show would damage that - but then the way I saw it is that like it or not the reality genre is a huge part of our cultural landscape, so why not embrace it? 

'I hope people will see that we put a lot into our lives here. We’re not just flitting from cocktail to cocktail.’ 

In any event, her main dismay having seen an early edit of the first episode is about her appearance. ‘I’ve got the opposite of body dysmorphia in that I’m one of these people who thinks I look pretty great most of the time – you know, I do yoga, I eat kale, how bad can it be?’ she laughed. 

‘Then I watched it and thought "where the hell did I get double chin". And the humidity didn’t do me any favours hair-wise.’

Sophie is the first to admit that adjustments had to be made: while Taking New York features a whirl of rooftop cocktail bars and openings she says the reality of her life is much harder work. ‘It’s part of the culture here. If someone sends you an email at 11pm not answering it is not an option.’ 

Then there are the different dating rules. ‘My penchant for American men is my downfall as they tend to date numerous people at the same time. So you’ve been dating someone for two months and you think maybe you are properly going out and they look at you like you’re a psycho. So there’s a degree of hopelessness with boys and my personal life is often in disarray,’ she admitted. 

All the better, of course, for the series producers, who for whom romantic trauma is a ratings boost.

Gagan Chadha, 27, has been in New York since 2010 and is one of the show's many lotharios

Step forward Gagan Chadha, 27, one of the (many) lotharios of the series - a suggestion he appears to be in no hurry to deny. ‘It’s inevitable. I’m surrounded constantly by models so it’s hard not to be,’ he shrugged. 

‘Being British definitely helps – the accent and even the way we dress is completely different. They can spot you a mile off.’

In fact, Manchester-born Gagan actually ended up in New York by accident, after attending a wedding there in 2010 and liking the city so much he never came back. 

‘I thought if I went home and tried to make a plan to move it would never happen so instead I thought I would just stay. The worst that was going to happen was that I would just have to come back.’ 

He didn’t have to – within six months he had returned to England, but only to pack up his things for good. After an internship for a hedge fund and a marketing firm he got paid work with an events firm, working his way up before setting up his own printing business and latterly running a bar and club. 

It helped that he had dual citizenship, courtesy of his family, who for a time were going to move to the US, meaning he had none of the visa trouble that plagues other ambitious young Brits. Still, he insists it wasn’t easy.

'At first I was like a headless chicken – I didn’t know where to go or what to do. I’d get on the subway and end up in the Bronx. It was hard to make friends too - the banter is completely different put here. So it took a while to adjust but I loved the lifestyle,’ he said.

It all certainly seems to have turned out rosily enough - these days Gagan rents an apartment in the West Village and counts Sarah Jessica Parker as his neighbour. ‘I see her most mornings when she takes her kids to school but it’s really not a big deal.’

It all feels insanely glamorous, what with the fashion parties and gallery openings. Still, Sophie insists there is a lot she misses about life back home.

‘Marks and Spencer, the sense of humour and self-deprecation, which doesn’t exist over here – over here if you do yourself down they assume you need therapy,’ she said. ‘I even miss drizzle.’ 

Not enough to come back though. Because as Amy puts it, New York is a seductive mistress. ‘It’s like an amazing lover,’ she said. ‘Sometimes it doesn’t treat you well and you know you deserve better - but you can’t deny there’s a chemistry and you always end up going back for more.’ 

The key question, of course, is whether the viewers will do the same.
