Bond: Paul O'Grady with Olga, who was given 18 months to live but has survived after a series of treatments

He was devastated when his beloved dog Buster died of cancer.

So when vets told Paul O’Grady his pet Olga was suffering the same condition and had only 18 months to live, he decided to do all he could to save her.

Ignoring advice to have her put down, the chat show host and Lily Savage star is paying £8,000 for the cairn terrier to undergo intense chemotherapy and surgery.

Olga has made guest appearances on his Channel 4 tea-time show since 2006 and is so close to his heart that he named his production firm Olga TV after her.

O’Grady, 58, who had 12 stents inserted into his arteries after two heart attacks, said the cost of the expensive treatments was not an issue.

‘She has had her kidney out and is now on chemo,’ he said.

‘Her operation cost twice as much as it did to give me a stent – it was £8,000. But I don’t care what it costs as I would sell my house to pay for it.’

The treatment seems to have been successful so far as the star revealed the nine-year-old dog was ‘flying around at the moment like a puppy’.

O’Grady was described as ‘absolutely gutted’ when Buster, his 14-year-old shihtzu-bichon frise cross, was put down in 2009.

The comedian developed a strong bond with the dog after rescuing him from a motorway and gave the full name of Buster Elvis Savage.

He later dedicated the second volume of his autobiography to his loyal companion, describing him as ‘the greatest canine star since Lassie’.

Namesake: The comedian has even named his production firm - Olga TV - after his beloved pet

Buster had appeared with O’Grady’s alter ego Lily Savage on the Big Breakfast and was replaced by Olga on his chat show.

The host told viewers the ageing pet was ‘in retirement’.

A memorial statue was made of Buster for Battersea Dogs Home, where O’Grady presents ITV show For The Love Of Dogs and is also a celebrity ambassador.

Paula Boyden, of the Dogs Trust, said it 
can be a ‘challenge’ to detect cancer in animals, but that treatments 
had improved following research into the human form of the illness.

An MRI scan - £2,000

Chemotherapy - up to £5,000

Overnight stay at vet's surgery - up to £55

A dog's arthritis tablets for one year - £120

Blood test for a dog - £128

Castrating a cat - £52

Parasite treatment for a rabbit - £50

Dental surgery for a cat - £233

A dog's X-ray - £232

Surgery on a cat's cataracts - £1,600 for one eye or £2,400 for operations on both

‘Some cancers are quite obvious to diagnose, but for example, blood cancer, can be quite difficult,’ she said.

‘There are three ways to treat the cancer: surgically remove it, radiotherapy under general anaesthetic as the dog has to remain very still or chemotherapy.

'Using chemotherapy on dogs does not produce the awful side-effects as in humans like losing hair because you are trying to prolong life for up to a couple of years – which is a lot for a dog – not completely cure it.

‘The £8,000 bill is not eyebrow-raising as it involves surgery. It probably costs around £4,000 for chemotherapy at a specialist centre and that’s why people take out pet insurance.’

O’Grady has had recent problems with his own health and was hospitalised after suffering an angina attack in November amid fears he was overworking.

He was revived in an ambulance after a heart attack in 2003 and admitted to intensive care following another in 2006. The former 40-a-day cigarette smoker told The Sun he has quit them for e-cigarettes.

‘When I get the urge I now suck on this new cigarette, although I’d sell the grandkids for 20 Lambert & Butler,’ he said.

O’Grady has three other dogs – Bullseye, Louis and Eddie – as well as pigs, sheep and chickens.
