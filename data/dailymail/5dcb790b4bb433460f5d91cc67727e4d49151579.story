A four-year-old girl was brought back to life on the side of the road by a passerby after being submerged in an upturned car in a ditch of water for ten minutes.

The accident happened  near Brandon in Mississippi on Sunday afternoon.

Helena White's mother crashed into the water after turning around to look at a drawing her daughter had done, according to Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey.

'By the time she turned back around to the front, she had lost control of the vehicle, overcorrected and flipped,' Bailey said, reports The Clarion Ledger.

Helena White is currently in a critical condition in hospital - she was given CPR by a passerby

Sherry Jackson told The Clarion Ledger the car was submerged in a ditch which had about 15-foot of water.

She said after hearing the mother's screams, she jumped into the water and found unconscious Helena in the back seat of the car - but she was trapped.

She said that her and a group of five other people could not pull her out and they had difficulty cutting her free from the car seat.

Finally the group managed to roll the car high enough out the water to move the objects in their way and cut Helena out of the seat.

'The little girl was blue,' Jackson said. 'We weren't sure if she was going to make it.'

They took her up the bank and placed her by the side of the road - Jackson did mouth-to-mouth.

A police dash cam shows them drawing up to the crowd where the little girl was and a deputy running out and taking over chest compressions.

Helena and her mother were transported to University of Mississippi Medical Center - the child is in a critical condition.

Jackson told The Clarion Ledger that she instinctively jumped in to the water.

'You don't think, you just do,' Jackson said. 

'God definitely put all of the right people there at the right time. 

'If it was my child, I know someone would have done the same thing for me.'

A witness Sherry Parker told MSNewsNow that Helena was underwater for nearly 10 minutes.
