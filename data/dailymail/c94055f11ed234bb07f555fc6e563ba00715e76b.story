A cancer patient who searched online for support about his disease was left horrified when Facebook began placing advertisement for funeral directors on his Facebook feed.

Daniel Kapp, 46, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last month. Shortly after he used the web to learn more about the illness.

When he opened Facebook the following day he said he was 'bombarded' with 'insensitive' promotions that he couldn't remove.

Daniel Kapp, 46, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last month and used the web to learn more about the illness. But when he opened Facebook the following day he said he was 'bombarded' with 'insensitive and tasteless' adverts for funeral directors. The consultant also tweeted about his surprise (shown) 

The adverts included promotions for funeral directors, including one called Bestattung Himmelblau Wien - which translates to Funeral Vienna Sky Blue. 

It showed an elderly couple with the tagline: 'Wir helfen Ihnen gerne!' or 'We're here to help.' 

Mr Kapp (pictured) is a strategic consultant in Austria. He described the Facebook adverts as 'scandalous'

'I was just knocked off my feet to see that there on the screen,' said Mr Kapp, who works as a strategic consultant in Austria. 

'It is just completely insensitive. And every time I tried to delete it, it appeared again.' 

He blamed Facebook for monitoring the data about the searches he had done and then using it in order to sell it on to potential advertisers.

The consultant also tweeted about his surprise: 'After going public on having cancer via FB I've started getting sponsored ads for funeral parlours #wtf #epicfail [sic]'

'I think it's just tasteless and scandalous,' Mr Kapp continued. 

'But it seems that anyone who is looking for information under the string search 'life expectancy ' or 'cancer' on Google can then expect to get inappropriate adverts on social networks.'  

When contacted by local media, the directors of the funeral companies said they were shocked their adverts were being used to target people in this way. One said: 'I can confirm that this should never have happened.'

Today Facebook added a new tool called Topic Data that now additionally scans what people are 'saying about events, brands, subjects and activities.'

The site stressed that no personal information is revealed because topic data is anonymised, and it is used to provide 'guidance for marketers' and not used target ads directly.

Facebook explained: 'We use cookies so we, or our affiliates and partners, can serve you ads that may be interesting to you on Facebook Services or other websites and mobile applications. 

'We also may use cookies to provide advertisers with insights about the people who see and interact with their ads, visit their websites, and use their apps.'
