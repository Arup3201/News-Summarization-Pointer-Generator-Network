Tory backbenchers criticised Planning Minister Nick Boles over plans to build thousands of homes on the Green Belt

Tory MPs staged a revolt yesterday against plans to build thousands  of homes on the Green Belt, saying  it would lead to ‘planning anarchy’ and lose them votes at the next election.

Angry backbenchers criticised Planning Minister Nick Boles for forcing a major building programme on councils to meet a chronic housing shortage.

But he said they had to respond to a housing crisis caused by an ageing population and uncontrolled immigration under the last Labour government.

Backbenchers said ministers had promised that they could decide where to build homes and draw up local plans.

But they claimed developers were 
being allowed to ride roughshod over the wishes of local planners and 
foist housing developments on unsuitable areas.

Former planning minister Sir Tony 
Baldry said four developments proposed in his Banbury constituency were 
refused by the council, only to be given the green light by Local 
Government Secretary Eric Pickles.

Sir Tony said the decisions ‘rode a 
coach and horses though protection for the Green Belt’, adding: ‘This is
not a sensible planning policy, this is planning anarchy.’

Under threat: Mr Boles has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis

Laurence Robertson, MP for 
Tewkesbury, said there was no shortage of homes in his constituency, but
developers planned to build 50 per cent more within 20 years.

He added: ‘I question the 
Government’s assertion that they must built so very many houses that 
local authorities have to designate green-belt land to meet these 
arbitrary and as yet undefined housing targets.

Former Home Office minister Nick Herbert warned of a 'free-for-all on our countryside'

Our policies on planning
are losing us many votes.’

Former Home Office minister Nick 
Herbert insisted that despite government rhetoric about empowering 
councils, home-building was ‘developer-led and effectively amounts to a 
free-for-all on our countryside’.

Last year, Mr Boles told councils to find the land to build 270,000 homes by 2018.

He has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis.

Yesterday he told MPs it was better to  build on former industrial land, but this could only be used for 70 per cent of the homes needed, adding: ‘Our population has grown, and we have not built enough houses to keep pace.

‘That growth has two main sources. One is immigration, but the majority – about two thirds – is a result of ageing.

'It used to be rare that there was a great grandparent in the family, now it is common. People are living longer and don’t want to live in the same house.’
