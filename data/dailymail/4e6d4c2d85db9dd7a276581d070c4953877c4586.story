One of Jamaica's bobsled Olympians has come to the defense of the San Diego football coaches who were suspended after they blacked up for Halloween.

Devon Harris, whose exploits during the 1988 winter Olympics inspired the film Cool Runnings, said he was flattered the high school coaches had dressed as the team.

The Olympian turned motivational speaker 
even contacted Serra High head football coach Brian Basteyns to tell him
the team had not been offended by his costume.

'I said to him "Listen, I think the only 
people you need to be worried about offending are the guys on the sled 
and at least three of us, cause I didn’t speak to Michael White about 
this, but certainly three of us are by no means offended",' Harris said.

Basteyns had been suspended for two days without pay, along with assistant coach Harold Seeley and a teacher after a civil rights groups complained about their costume, according to Fox 5.

The coaches had blacked up and wore Jamaican bobsled outfits in a picture that was posted to Basteyns' Facebook page.

Harris, who went on to compete in the 1992 and 1998 Winter Olympics, said he and two of his fellow teammates had not been offended, and complained that people were 'hyper sensitive' when it came to racism.

He added: 'People are simply hyper sensitive when it comes down to race and racism ... every time we brush up on anything race or ethnic, people just go off the deep end.'

Coach Basteyns confirmed he had spoken to Harris but declined to speak further about it.

The image was posted on Bastenys’ Facebook page over the weekend, but has since been removed.

On his account, Mr Seeley posted Monday: 
‘I am absolutely mind boggled right now. He who is without sin shall 
cast the first stone.’ The message was accompanied by a sad-face 
emoticon and the hashtag ‘feeling disappointed.’

Parent Sally Smith, who was among the first to spot the offending picture online, has called for Bastenys to be fired.

‘This is just the tip of the iceberg,’ she told Fox5 San Diego. ‘This behavior of dressing in blackface shows disrespect and poor judgment.’

Witnesses had told 10News they saw the coaches in blackface, Jamaican-flag leotards and yellow helmets during a game on Saturday last week.

San
Diego Unified School Board trustee John Lee Evans said on Tuesday that he 
has not seen the photo, but had been informed about the incident, which 
is currently under investigation. 

‘If
there is inappropriate behavior, that needs to be dealt with by the 
superintendent and her staff,’ Mr Evans said. ‘We take these situations 
very seriously because we hold our employees to a very high standard.’

Official response: San Diego Unified School Board is investigating the actions of the two Serra High School coaches

Parents and students in the district were divided in their response to the costumes.

Some
members of the Serra High School community decried the coaches’ alleged
lapse in judgment, while others came to their defense, saying they were
clearly just having fun.

Al Dave, who worked with the coaches for several years as a volunteer, insisted to CBS8 that they are not racist, and that the whole episode has been blown out of proportion.
