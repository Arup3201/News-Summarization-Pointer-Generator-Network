Troubled oil giant BP was today forced to deny that it was seeking help from David Cameron as it fights for its future in the wake of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago.

The company says it is facing a flood of false claims relating to the spill, and commentators have said it may have to pay out so much compensation it could be taken over by a competitor.

Reports even suggested that the firm had appealed directly to the Prime Minister, asking him to raise the issue with the U.S. government in an attempt to limit BP's losses.

However, Government officials today insisted that Mr Cameron had not been approached by BP, adding that the firm's troubles did not come up at a recent meeting with Barack Obama.

SOS: Reports have claimed that BP is seeking the help of David Cameron to avoid a slew of compensation claims

BP has sought an injunction to stop payouts to companies which are allegedly claiming fraudulent or inflated losses from its $8.2billion (£5.4billion) pot of compensation for the disaster.

An appeal document recently filed by BP in the U.S. courts claims that businesses from the Gulf coast have been handed millions of dollars for 'non-existent, artificially calculated losses'.

The blow-out of the Deepwater Horizon well off the Louisiana coast in 2010 claimed 11 lives and damaged fishing and tourism industries as well as marine and wildlife habitats, forcing BP to agree a multi-billion-dollar compensation deal in April 2012.

But BP warned that it would be 'irreparably harmed' unless the compensation system is reformed.

The oil giant has said the cash drain could put its dividend at risk, and some experts feel this will make it vulnerable to a takeover.

BP said it has 'been ordered to pay 
hundreds of millions of dollars - soon likely to be billions - for 
fictitious and inflated losses'.

The
claim adds: 'If this travesty is allowed to continue, BP will be 
irreparably harmed and future defendants will be reluctant to settle 
because they cannot be confident that settlement agreements will be 
construed textually and fairly.'

In its first-quarter results published last month, BP warned that compensation may be 'significantly higher' than the $8.2billion it has set aside, because it had underestimated the number of claims it would receive.

BP also emphasised that the compensation settlement is 'uncapped except for economic loss claims related to the Gulf seafood industry'.

The complaint centres on the claim that businesses are allowed to compare earnings before and after the spill in ways which appear to inflate their losses.

It mentions a $9.7million US dollar (£6.4million) payout to a construction company based 200 miles off the coast of Alabama, even though 2010 was in fact its best year on record.

The company has already sold $38billion (£25billion) of assets to cover the known costs of the disaster.

BP and fellow oil giant Shell also face a European Commission investigation into price-rigging claims, after investigators raided several companies in the sector.
