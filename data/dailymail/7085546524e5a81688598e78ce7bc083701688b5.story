Gary Cahill will be taking Italy’s winner in Saturday’s World Cup opener personally. When you’re a top defender, that is how you feel.

To be fair to the Chelsea defender, he was taken out of the game by Antonio Candreva’s pinpoint cross. The ball was played into the most difficult area for Cahill to deal with it — the back post.

If Candreva had played the ball anywhere else in the penalty area, Cahill would have dealt with it.

Unfortunately, Cahill got caught under the ball and Mario Balotelli scored with an easy header.

As a defender, I know how hard it is to deal with that sort of ball, but by the same token you have to find a way of stopping crosses like Candreva’s.

In international football, particularly as a defender, you have to be in a state of total concentration. One lapse, just for a split-second, can cost you.

In the lead-up to Italy’s winner Balotelli was pulling off Cahill’s shoulder, sensing where his team-mate was going to put the ball. As a defender, you need to sense that run really early and get the necessary steps in to ensure you are in the best position to deal with the cross.

If you don’t, you are left just flinging yourself in the air because the striker can see you, but you can’t see him and you are just hoping you can get yourself in the way.

If you sense the danger early, you will be better prepared to drop off quicker and get those important steps in to help you deal with the situation.

It is important to stress that Cahill is playing in a World Cup against the planet’s most dangerous strikers. Even if you do drop off and get yourself into a good position, moments like Balotelli’s goal can happen.

Cahill and England’s defence must now forget about the Italy game and focus on Uruguay — and possibly Luis Suarez  — on Thursday.

We all know Suarez is a match-winner, as is Edinson Cavani, and Diego Forlan can be. Defensively,  Uruguay didn’t look particularly good against Costa Rica on Saturday, so England certainly have enough going forward to come away with the result needed.

But what is important is that England are harder to break down. It could help if Steven Gerrard plays in a deeper role. He played that deep-lying central midfield role for Liverpool last season and it could help England get the result they need.

England’s centre-halves will need all the help they can get against  Uruguay, and Gerrard can be the one to provide that protection — particularly if Suarez plays.
