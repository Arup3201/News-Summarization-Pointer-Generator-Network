A couple are facing neglect charges after their nine-year-old son was found with a cockroach buried in his ear.

A school nurse noticed the insect while checking over the boy following a previous incident when cockroaches crawled out of his backpack.

Authorities said the boy often smelled of urine, wore the same clothes and was fed by teachers who helped clean him up.

Neglect charges: Christina and Robert Forbes are facing neglect charges after their son was found with cockroaches crawling over his body in Beverly Hills, Florida

Police went to the boy's home in Beverly Hills, Florida, where they found appalling living conditions with cockroaches crawling over the house.

Robert and Christina Forbes were arrested on suspected child neglect. A spokesman for Citrus County Sheriff's office said conditions in the home were 'deplorable'.

Neighbors said there were signs that something was wrong because the boy was never allowed outside the house to play with other children.

'We would open the door and you would see him in the window pounding... literally pounding [on the window],' said neighbor Angelica Perez.

Christina and Robert were taken to the Citrus County jail and held on $5,000 bond, while the child was placed in alternative care.
