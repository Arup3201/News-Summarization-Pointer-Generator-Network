Just as Arthur Sulzberger Jr. comes out swinging against accusations former executive editor Jill Abramson was paid less than her male predecessor, Abramson is using her free time to throw punches of her own, with a new hobby: boxing.

The axed editor's daughter Cornelia posted an Instagram photo Thursday afternoon showing her mom wearing gloves and smirking at a boxing bag with the message, 'Mom's badass new hobby.'

With the message were the hashtags '#girls' and '#pushy,' presumably in reference to rumors Abramson was fired for demanding more money after learning the previous, and male, editor made far more.

#pushy: Recently canned New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson is using her newly discovered free time to take up boxing...and to fuel rumors she was fired for being #pushy with this Instagram photo posted by her daughter

Pushback: NYT publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. has already swung back with a Thursday memo to employees that said not only was Abramson not paid less than her male predecessor, but was compensated more

Meanwhile, Sulzberger said in a Thursday staff memo that those reports are completely untrue.

'It is simply not true that Jill’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors,' he wrote in the memo, obtained by Politico. 'Her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors.'

Sulzberger attributed Abramson's termination in his Wednesday announcement to the New York Times newsroom to 'an issue with management in the newsroom.'

The publisher said in his memo that he wanted to 'set the record straight' about 'misinformation' regarding Abramson's salary.

In fact, Sulzberger claims she made even more than the man she replaced.

'In 2013, her last full year in the role, her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than that of her predecessor, Bill Keller, in his last full year as Executive Editor, which was 2010,' he wrote. 'It was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year.'

The Times announced the abrupt management change on Wednesday, but didn't give a reason, which prompted a flurry of speculation in media circles.

In a blog post, New Yorker staff writer Ken Auletta quoted an anonymous 'close associate' who said Abramson confronted the Times' 'top brass' about her pay after discovering that both her pay and her pension benefits were less than that of her male predecessor, Bill Keller.

The confrontation, Auletta wrote, 'may have fed into the management's narrative that she was "pushy."'

In Thursday's memo, Sulzberger said that the only reason behind his decision to dismiss Abrams was 'concerns I had about some aspects of Jill's management of our newsroom, which I had previously made clear to her, both face-to-face and in my annual assessment.'

Abramson, 60, was the paper's first female executive editor. She joined the newspaper in 1997 after working for nearly a decade at The Wall Street Journal. She was the Times' Washington editor and bureau chief before being named managing editor in 2003.

Memo from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. obtained by POLITICO

Dear Colleagues,

I am writing to you because I am concerned about the misinformation that has been widely circulating in the media since I announced Jill Abramson’s departure yesterday.  I particularly want to set the record straight about Jill’s pay as Executive Editor of The Times.

It is simply not true that Jill’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors.  Her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors.  In fact, in 2013, her last full year in the role, her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than that of her predecessor, Bill Keller, in his last full year as Executive Editor, which was 2010.  It was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year.

Comparisons between the pensions of different executive editors are difficult for several reasons.  Pensions are based upon years of service with the Company.  Jill’s years of service were significantly fewer than those of many of her predecessors.  Secondly, as you may know, pension plans for all managers at The New York Times were frozen in 2009.  But this and all other pension changes at the Company have been applied without any gender bias and Jill was not singled out or differentially disadvantaged in any way.

Compensation played no part whatsoever in my decision that Jill could not remain as executive editor. Nor did any discussion about compensation.  The reason — the only reason — for that decision was concerns I had about some aspects of Jill’s management of our newsroom, which I had previously made clear to her, both face-to-face and in my annual assessment.

This Company is fully committed to equal treatment of all its employees, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or any other characteristic. We are working hard to live up to that principle in every part of our organization.  I am satisfied that we fully lived up to that commitment with regard to Jill.

Arthur
