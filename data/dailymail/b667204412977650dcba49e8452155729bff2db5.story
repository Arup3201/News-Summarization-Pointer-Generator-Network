Predator: Cristian Pereira, 31, was jailed for 13-and-a-half years by a judge after being convicted of rape

A wanted Brazilian rapist fled to the UK and attacked a student after posing as a female au pair, a court heard.

Cristian Pereira tricked his 19-year-old victim into believing he was a woman after befriending her on the internet.

The predator took the teenager to a remote field where he raped her and was only caught after his van got stuck in the mud.

After he was arrested it emerged that the 31-year-old was wanted by the Brazilian authorities for a similar sex attack.

He had fled South America in 2012, where he had been convicted of rape and handed a 13-and-half-year prison sentence in his absence.

Oxford Crown Court heard Pereira contacted his teenage victim through a fake Facebook profile in which he posed as a female au pair called Tais Bottecchia.

After getting to know each other, the victim accepted an offer from Pereira for a lift to Heathrow airport on April 29.

When he turned up at the meeting point, he claimed the 'au pair' had asked him to collect her.

Once she got in the van, the young woman was driven to remote farmland and raped. 

'The victim was terrified and feared for her life,' said Adrian Foster, the Thames Valley and Chiltern Chief Crown Prosecutor. 

'She tried to escape on two occasions, but Pereira was stronger and faster than her.

'After her ordeal she had little option but to get back into his van, which became stuck in heavy mud enabling her to make her escape.

'She was found by a farmer, who contacted the police and Pereira was arrested nearby.' 

It also emerged that Pereira was on bail at the time of the rape after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at the exact same location. 

Police found possessions including an Italian ID card, a passport, £3,000 in cash and clothes in his van.

Pereira's home in Samphire Road, Oxford, was virtually empty, leading detectives to believe he was planning to flee the area or the country after the attack.

He initially claimed the victim had consented to the sexual activity, but admitted the offence when presented with damning evidence.

It was also claimed that while living in England he hacked the accounts of up to 180 Brazilian women before blackmailing them by demanding they perform virtual sex acts in order to get their profiles back.

Mr Foster said: 'As a result of further inquiries made by Thames Valley Police and the CPS, it has been established that Pereira is currently wanted by the Brazilian Authorities for an offence of rape, for which he has been convicted and sentenced in his absence in Brazil.'

Sentencing, Judge Ian Pringle told Pereira: 'Your behaviour that day was utterly unspeakable and would fill the vast majority of people in this country with horror.

'I have no doubt in finding you to be a dangerous individual.

'It is difficult to imagine a worse case than this. You have no remorse for what you did.'

He was jailed for 13-and-a-half years for two counts of rape and four years for sexual assault, to be served concurrently.

He will be deported to serve his sentence in Brazil once he has served his time in England.

His victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, thanked Thames Valley Police for their support.

'All the officers I have met gave me the impression that they didn't judge me, that they believed me and that they were trying to help me while always remaining professional,' she said.

'My special thanks go out to Pc Maria Gilio, whose support played the most important role in the early days of my recovery.

'I would also like to encourage anyone - not only victims of rape - but everyone who has faced or is facing a difficult time in life to keep fighting.

'Stay strong, don't give up, it will get better again. Life is worth living.' 

Detective Inspector Louise Roddy said: 'I am pleased with the sentence result which prevents an extremely dangerous man being able to commit any more horrendous crimes.

'My absolute admiration goes to the victim, who has managed to start rebuilding her life due to her strength of character and determination.'
