 

The West Australian police commissioner's son has maintained his innocence during a brief court appearance.

Allegations against Russell O'Callaghan include threatening to kill, deprivation of liberty and aggravated indecent assault after an alleged two-day incident in August involving his partner.

He stands accused of holding his ex-partner hostage during which he threatened to kill her.

The 34-year-old appeared in Fremantle Magistrates Court on today where his lawyer Mark Andrews requested the matter move forward to a committal mention date.

O'Callaghan remained silent throughout the proceedings, and must continue the court-granted home detention enforced last month under strict instructions. 

He must remain at home unless attending court-approved meetings, is under electronic surveillance and is prohibited from taking illicit drugs. 

Magistrate Pamela Hogan referred the matter to the Perth Magistrates Court for Friday, November 28.

The 34-year-old stands accused of seven charges, including threatening to kill, deprivation of liberty and aggravated indecent assault of his ex-partner in August

Mr. O'Callaghan's legal representation had previously indicated that he would plead not guilty to all seven charges against him. 

 O'Callaghan tried to dodge the waiting media outside court by leaving from a different door and did not answer questions.

Police commissioner Karl O'Callaghan has previously refused to comment on the case while it is before the courts but has said he is staying out of the police investigation.

O'Callaghan will appear in Perth Magistrates Court on November 28.
