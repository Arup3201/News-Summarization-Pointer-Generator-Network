Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner said the team are devastated after more than 60 trophies were stolen from their factory on Saturday morning.

A group of around six men used a silver 4x4 to smash through the front entrance to the factory in Milton Keynes.

No Red Bull staff were hurt during the robbery but the burglars – believed to be men wearing dark clothing – caused ‘significant damage’.

A second vechicle – a dark coloured Mercedes estate car- was used by the burglars. Both cars are believed to have foreign number plates.

'We are obviously devastated by this serious factory break in, which saw offenders drive a vehicle through our front entrance and steal more than 60 trophies which took years and hard work to accumulate' said Horner.

'The break-in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time. The offenders took items that not only did not belong to them, but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated, hard-working individuals.

'Beyond the aggressive nature of this break-in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one.

'But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas.

'The actions of these men mean it's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future, which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our Formula One car.'
