High speed 4G mobile phone networks are finally coming to Britain - but consumers will not be able to use them until the end of next year at the earliest, regulator Ofcom admitted today.

The telecoms regulator unveiled plans for the auction of fourth generation (4G) bandwidth for mobile phone services, but has said bidding will not start until early 2013.

The high speed technology promises to allow smartphone owners to watch high definition TV on the move.

High speed delays: Ofcom today announced plans to set up high speed 4G phone networks in the UK - but customers will have to wait until the end of 2013 to use them

Last year, the watchdog said it hoped to run the sale towards the end of 2012, after it was initially scheduled to take place early in 2012.

The auction will sell chunks of radio spectrum to support future 4G mobile services, providing superfast broadband to mobile devices.

The move will give access to the fourth 
generation, or 4G, network, to at least 98% of people across the UK, 
which will allow users to download data - such as music and 
high-definition films - at much faster speeds, Ofcom said.

Eddie Murphy, telecoms analyst and founder of Priory Consulting, told the BBC that there would be a feeling of deflation in the industry, given the new delay.

'There was a general expectation that there would be a date for the auction this morning,' he said.'But it's probably very important from Ofcom's point of view to get it right.'

The auction will offer the equivalent of three-quarters of the mobile spectrum currently in use - some 80% more than released in the 3G auction which took place in 2000.

The proposed reserve prices for the 4G auction lots add up to £805.1 million - but they are thought to raise much more after the 3G sale pulled in a staggering £22.5 billion from mobile companies.

Ofcom said it expects the auction process to start before the end of this year, with prospective bidders required formally to apply to take part.

Those applications will then be assessed by Ofcom before the bidding phase starts, likely to be in early 2013.

Mobile operators are expected to start rolling out 4G networks using the auctioned spectrum from the middle of 2013, and to start offering 4G services to consumers later that year, Ofcom added.

Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards said: 'The 4G auction has been designed to deliver the maximum possible benefit to consumers and citizens across the UK.

'As a direct result of the measures Ofcom is introducing, consumers will be able to surf the web, stream videos and download email attachments on their mobile device from almost every home in the UK.'

Ofcom decided to reserve a minimum amount of spectrum in the auction for a fourth operator on top of the three biggest mobile companies - Vodafone, 02 owner Telefonica, and Orange and T-Mobile firm Everything Everywhere.

The new auction will offer at least two spectrum bands - 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz.

The lower frequency 800 MHz band is ideal for widespread mobile coverage, while the higher frequency is ideal for delivering the capacity needed to deliver faster speeds.

The combination of low and high frequency spectrum creates the potential for 4G mobile broadband services to be widely available across the UK, while offering capacity to cope with significant demand in urban areas.
