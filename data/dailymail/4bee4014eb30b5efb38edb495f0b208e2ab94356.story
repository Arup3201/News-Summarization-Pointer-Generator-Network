An Australian TV network has broadcast an interview with a man who claims to know where the body of murdered British man Peter Falconio was dumped in the Australian outback.

The mystery of where the Yorkshire man's remains lie after he went missing in a remote part of Australia has endured for almost 13 years.

Seven Network's Today Tonight programme claims a witness to the aftermath of 28-year-old Falconio's July 2001 murder has only just come forward.

Body found? Nearly 13 years after murdered British tourist, Peter Falconio and girlfriend Joanne Lees were attacked in the Australian outback, his remains may soon be located

The man, who lives in an isolated region of Australia, had not closely followed the case of Falconio and his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape their attacker and hide in the freezing desert before making it to safety.

It was only when Bradley John Murdoch was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2006, that the man made the connection with what he had witnessed.

Acting on a tip-off, Today Tonight reporter Frank Pangallo and a team travelled to the alleged location.

The location was named last night as Neutral Junction Station in the Northern Territory,  just over a mile from where Falconio disappeared.

Footage of their journey to the site, was screened on Australian television. One of the team was a woman who is an expert in locating hidden burial sites.

In a world exclusive story, Paul Jackson told the Seven Network's Today Tonight that an unnamed man had seen a vehicle closely resembling that of Falconio's convicted murderer, Bradley Murdoch, on the station 80 minutes after the assault on Falconio and Joanne Lees.

Mr Jackson said he believed Falconio's remains - now a skeleton - lay at the bottom of a well on the Neutral Junction property.

Torrential downpours prevented the Today Tonight team from completing their search for Falconio, but the investigation to find him will continue next week when the outback rains have cleared.

Mr Pangallo said the location was probably overlooked by the Northern Territory police searching for Peter Falconio's body because it was 'so obvious'.

Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees, both from Yorkshire, were touring Australia in an orange Kombi van in July 2001, when a man flagged them down on a lonely stretch of the Stuart Highway, around 180 miles north of Alice Springs.

After Falconio got out of the car to speak with the man, Lees heard a shot and then a person later identified as Bradley Murdoch handcuffed her before she managed to escape into the bush.

She never saw her boyfriend again.

Police later found a pool of blood on the road, but were never able to locate Falconio's remains.

Murdoch was later convicted of Mr Falconio’s murder, largely on DNA evidence which included a spot of Joanne Lees's blood on his T-shirt.

Murdoch is serving a life prison sentence in the Northern Territory and has always protested his innocence, saying he cannot reveal where Falconio’s body is because he wasn't there.

He lodged an appeal against his conviction last December, claiming crown prosecutors coached Lees in giving her evidence at his trial.
