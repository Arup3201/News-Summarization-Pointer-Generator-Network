A source close to Tory Burch has denied rumors that she is dating Google billionaire Eric Schmidt.

According to the New York Post, the pair are nothing more than business associates.

The 
'malicious rumor' surrounding the pair is reportedly '1,000per cent not true,' says the insider. 'Tory 
and Eric admire each other strictly on a business level.'

The paper went on to report
that 'Burch has only seen the billionaire twice in the past six months,
at her holiday party and at a lunch at the Four Seasons.'

Apparently, the Executive Chairman of Google is solely a mentor figure for the fashion designer.

Moving on? Tory Burch has apparently split from Lyor Cohen

'Eric is an investor in her company and a business adviser, and speaks to her board,' said the source.

The New York Post reported on Friday that the mother-of-three had split from her boyfriend of five years, Warner Music head Lyor Cohen.

Mr Schmidt, 57, is still married to reportedly estranged wife Wendy, who lives in their Nantucket home while he resides in Silicon Valley, California.

A rep for the Google executive declined to comment on rumors of a relationship with Ms Burch.

Last year, Forbes ranked Mr Schmidt the 138th richest person in the world, with an estimated wealth of $7.5billion.

Ms Burch, 46, is believed to be a 
billionaire herself now, since her former husband Chris Burch sold 
nearly half of his 28.3per cent stake in Tory Burch LLC.

After receiving more than $70million 
from equity sales and dividends, the fashion designer, who also owns 
28.3per cent of her company - worth about $935million - saw her net 
worth push past the $1billion mark for the first time last month.

Mr Burch - who co-founded the brand in 
2003 when he and Ms Burch were still married - began the legal 
proceedings last October, when he sued her 'for breach of contract and 
interference with the sale of his shares of the company.'

Ms Burch filed a counterclaim that 
her ex-husband was selling products closely resembling her 
upmarket-bohemian aesthetic in his newly launched solo line of stores, 
C. Wonder.

A source told the New York Post that the designer - who showed her fall 2013 collection at New York Fashion Week earlier this month - had an amicable breakup with Lyor Cohen, and that the pair have spent time together since the separation.

The designer has three sons from her former marriage to Chris Burch.
