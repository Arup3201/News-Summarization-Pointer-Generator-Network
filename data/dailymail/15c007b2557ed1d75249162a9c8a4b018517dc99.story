Hodan Abby fled to Syria with her friend Hafsa Mohamed (pictured) last month

The parents of a young Sydney woman who fled to Syria to offer herself as a jihadi bride to Islamic State militants, have travelled to the Middle East to search for their daughter and attempt to bring her back to Australia.

It comes after Hodan Abby, 18, and her friend Hafsa Mohamed, 20, slipped out of the country last month after the pair had reportedly told their parents they were going on a holiday.

After discovering that their daughter had crossed the Turkish border and made her way into Syria, the news left her parents feeling 'devastated'.

It is believed that Ms Abby's father is still on a desperate search in Middle East while her mother has returned to their Western Sydney home, the Daily Telegraph reports.

While her friend Ms Mohamed, who was a childcare worker took to the internet to look for a husband, who were heading to the Middle East before she disappeared, adding that she longed to be a martyr 'for the sake of Allah'.

'If any mature guy wanting to go to Syria or Palestine would propose I would accept without a thought though he should be on his dean and must have a beard,' Hafsa wrote, according to News Corp.

'Pray that my dream of going to Syria is fulfilled. I want to bring it up with my mum but I'm afraid to do so … Australia is nice but I would rather be in Syria.

'… How great to be martyred for the sake of Allah and going into a transaction with him by giving him your life and he will repay you with Jannah.'

She and her friend could face up to 10 years in jail if they try to return to Australia.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop admitted last month, that the reports of young Australians travelling overseas to join the Islamic State is a 'deeply disturbing phenomenon', the Sunday Telegraph wrote.

'We are now seeing examples of young women being radicalised and travelling to Syria and Iraq to take part in fighting for listed terrorists organisations,' she said.

It came just a day after the father of  Australian jihadist Amira Karroum, who was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in  Syria, said he planned to sue the Australian government for his 'angel's' death.

Educated at an Anglican private school in Queensland, Amira Karroum became a devout Muslim, donning the hijab, after moving to Sydney with her sister in 2011

During an explosive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, Mohamed Karroum said he blames Australian authorities for his daughter's death because they allowed radical Islamic recruiters into the country and they 'allowed her to leave'.

In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum told journalist Lisa Goddard: 'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.'

'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair. 

'I want to take the federal government to court; they are responsible for the death of my daughter.'

Amira, 22, described by her father as a 'beautiful girl' who loved barbecues and dancing with her friends, was in war-torn Syria with her new  husband Tyler Perry, also known as Yusef Ali.

The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. 

Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia.

Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death.

'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. 

He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter.

Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities.

'I believe she was sacrificed because they were trying to take somebody to court, and they knew she would lead them to him,' he said.  

'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO are not doing their job, this is the fact.'

He is now looking for a lawyer to help him take the federal government to court.

'I want an apology, that's number one, for killing my daughter.'
