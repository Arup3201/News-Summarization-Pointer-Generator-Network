Don't look down!

A new video takes viewers on a stomach-churning ride aboard Tatsu - the world's most extreme flying roller coaster which cost an estimated $21million to build at the Six Flags theme park in California.

Filmed on a GoPro camera from the front seat, footage cuts from blue skies to green ground as the carriage twists and turns at 62mph.

At the beginning, passengers reach 17-stories-high before plummeting down. They are then treated to various high-speed loop-de-loops and corkscrews.

People can be heard screaming and laughing as the g-force kicks in.

Tatsu is a flying roller coaster with an utterly unique way to ride - face down.

It is one of the tallest, longest, and fastest flying coasters in the world. 

The steel structure, which opened in 2006, is 170ft tall and includes 3,602ft of track twisted into scream-inducing heights and dips. 

The ride's name comes from Japanese mythology and means 'flying beast' in Japanese. The recent rider video was shot by YouTube user GoPro Ozzy.
