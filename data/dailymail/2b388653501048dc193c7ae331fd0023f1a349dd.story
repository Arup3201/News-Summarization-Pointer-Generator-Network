The traditional two-week annual holiday could become a thing of the past within ten years as families increasingly opt for several 'mini-breaks' instead, according to new research.

A study of Britons' changing holiday habits also predicted that by 2023 the majority of the British people will travel with multiple generations of their family including parents, grandparents and children.

And rather than head abroad to the sunshine, twice as many will have 'staycations' in the UK, taking an average of two or three trips each year for four days.

The traditional family vacation of two weeks abroad, is often now unpractical for busy modern families

Accommodation preferences are also set to transform, with many Brits choosing to stay in unusual locations such as lighthouses and windmills.

The report, which examined the holiday habits of over 10,000 people, also showed that staycations have jumped by more than 61 per cent this summer, compared to 2012.

A separate study from Mintel has shown that overseas holidays have continued to fall since 2010, dropping an estimated five per cent in the last year.

Recent figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) also show that travel to long-haul destinations fell by five per cent in 2012.

The cost of overseas trips, and environmental issues concerned with flying, are the leading cause of the fall in Brits travelling abroad.

The report also revealed that 
savvy Brits are searching for better value breaks, and there is a 
growing demand for interesting destinations closer to home.

Charles Millward, chief executive of 
luxury cottage rental firm Rural Retreats which produced the report, 
said: 'More and more of us 
are enjoying holidays with our extended family.

The good weather this summer has seen people taking advantage of England's natural beauty spots such as The Durdle Door at Jurassic Coast, near West Lulworth in Dorset

'Our
 hectic lifestyles also mean the typical two-week trip is no longer 
practical for most families, and as a result it is being phased out in 
favour of the four day mini-break.

'Many families, because of university or work commitments, also find that increasingly they live apart.

'Mini-breaks
 provide an opportunity for relatives to get together at short notice, 
and it seems that this trend will become even more of a popular option 
for holiday-goers over the next decade.'

Charles added:'With the economy still fluctuating and money tight, UK travellers are increasingly swapping long-haul flights and trips aboard to favourite destinations in the UK.

'The trend for staycations has been increasing year on year, and the great weather this summer has been a watershed.

'The weather has caused Brits to flock back to UK's beaches, attractions and heritage; some of the finest in all of Europe.

'This year in particular has shown that the UK can be a fantastic holiday choice, and may provide a boost to the UK tourism industry which will see many more Brits choosing to explore UK shores over the next decade rather than holiday abroad.'

Charles explains: 'There has been a large increase in people holidaying in unconventional accommodation, from railway carriages, to windmills and even lighthouses.

'We've witnessed a 40 per cent increase in people staying in our lighthouse properties in the last year, with Cornwall in particular proving popular.

'The next ten years for the UK travel and tourism industry is looking increasingly healthy, with the holiday habits of Brits suggesting that in a decade's time many more of us will be content to holiday at home.'
