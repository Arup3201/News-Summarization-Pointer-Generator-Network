Vets have found a novel way of treating an albino alligator who suffers from back and leg problems.

Bino was born eight years ago with the apparently incurable ailments of hunchback and scoliosis - but he is now receiving acupuncture at the Sao Paulo Aquarium, where he has lived since 2007.

Once a week, several needles are inserted into Bino's back - and the treatment is working. He is already able to twitch his tail again and move his back legs, which until recently he was unable to do.

Scoliosis sufferer: Bino, the albino alligator, receives acupuncture treatment. Veterinarians at the Sao Paulo Aquarium in Brazil decided on the novel treatment for Bino, who suffers from hunchback and scoliosis

In early 2011 veterinarians at the aquarium in Brazil decided to see if acupuncture might help Bino, as it has with other animals living at the aquarium.

‘The
acupuncture will ... alleviate his pain and keep all his vital 
functions going,’ said Rafael Gutierrez, a biologist at the aquarium of 
Sao Paulo.

He added that the 30-minute weekly treatments would continue indefinitely, as long as they kept showing solid results.

Acupuncture
on animals is becoming increasingly common around the globe, the 
biologists at the Sao Paulo aquarium said, especially with pets such as 
cats, dogs and horses.

The use of acupuncture on animals began thousands of years ago in China.

In
the US, the number of veterinarians who hold membership in the American
Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture has jumped 50 per cent in the last 
few years to 900 doctors, said Simon Flynn, the executive director of 
the academy that is based in Glastonbury, Connecticut.

What is acupuncture?

An ancient treatment first practised in China around 1,000 years ago. It arrived in Europe in the 17th century, but there has only been strong public interest in it since the 1970s.

How does it work?

The traditional Chinese view is that energy - or 'Qi' - flows directly through 12 main channels, called meridians, in the body and if the flow is interrupted it can cause ill-health.

Inserting tiny needles and manipulating them at 'trigger points' restores the flow of energy.

It is believed the needles stimulate skin and muscle nerves, releasing the body's natural painkillers - endorphins and serotonin - into the pain pathways of the spinal cord and the brain to modify the way pain signals are received.What is it used to treat?

Some people have acupuncture to 'strengthen' their constitution.

But it is commonly used for anxiety, asthma, arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, infertility, menstrual problems, migraines, rheumatism, skin conditions and ulcers.

‘There
are many zoo veterinarians who use acupuncture, a number of equine 
practitioners who treat race horses with acupuncture, it's proven to be a
useful treatment,’ Mr Flynn said.

‘It's
common with dogs and it's becoming increasingly common with cats. More 
veterinarians are seeing the worth of the treatment.’

Typical
ailments treated by acupuncture include neck and back issues, skin 
problems and pain in general, among other complaints, he added.

Bino
requires a few precautions not needed with your average house cat.

Inserting the needles into Bino's back requires the important first step
of taping shut his lock-tight jaws full of sharp teeth.

Bino
wrestles around a bit as the tape is applied, but soon calms down. Vet
Daniela Cervaletti then slides behind Bino, firmly pressing the needles
into his leathery white and yellow hide.

The needles are inserted along his spine and around the area where the animal developed a hunchback.

Bino
does not move at all as nearly a dozen needles go in. Ms Cervaletti 
gently strokes the side of Bino's neck after she applies them all, then 
waits several minutes before removing them.

The
treatment complete, handlers help Bino back into a display pool, his 
white skin stark against brown fake rocks painted with foliage.

He
moves easily and swishes his tail, gliding along the water as a group of schoolchildren in matching uniforms squeal in 
delight, faces pressed up against the glass separating them from Bino.
