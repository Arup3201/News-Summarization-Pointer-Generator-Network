Tragic: Robert Sebbage was stabbed to death on the last night of his holiday on the Greek island of Zante

The mother of a British teenager stabbed to death on his first foreign holiday today expressed her disappointment at the 11-year sentence handed to his killer.

Robert Sebbage, 18, was stabbed to death by taxi driver Stelios Morfis in a melee during a rite of passage boys' trip to the Greek island of Zante.

Four of his friends were also stabbed, with two suffering serious injuries.

Today Robert's family insisted the attack was senseless and they expressed their fury that the killer was cleared of murder but convicted of 'unintentional manslaughter'.

Morfis also got separate two-year sentences for inflicting life-threatening bodily harm on Jordan Manson, Steven Granston, Calum Lane and Sam Champion.

He was given a further two year sentence for carrying an offensive weapon and an extra year's jail for using a blade.

But his overall 16-year sentence was reduced to 11 years, to include some concurrent sentences.

After hearing the jury's verdict today on the Greek mainland, Robert's devastated mother Rhian told he she felt the sentence did not match the enormity of Morfis's crime.

'Nothing will bring him back but we 
strongly believe that the sentence passed does not reflect the horrific 
and senseless killing of our son,' Mrs Sebbage said.

'We take solace from the fact that Morfis was found guilty of taking our son's life and attacking four of his friends.

'We
are also comforted that Robert's good character and reputation was 
acknowledged in court and that the other boys who were attacked were 
accurately represented as the victims of this violent assault.

'We
are grateful to all those people and organisations in the UK and Greece
who have helped us during this horrible time - in particular, our 
families, friends and local people.

'It is their wholehearted support that has allowed us to be here to fight for justice for Robert and his friends.'

Holiday of a lifetime: The last picture of Robert alive taken in Zante before he was stabbed to death by a taxi driver

Mrs Sebbage, speaking on behalf of the 21 Britons who travelled to Greece for the two-week trial, asked for privacy to be able to move on with their grief.

All five families, from the Tadley, 
Hampshire, area, had insisted their sons respected the Greek culture 
during their stay on the holiday island.

However,
Morfis turned on them with a baseball bat and then a knife after they 
had helped a drunken stranger out of the back of his taxi in the resort 
last summer.

Knifeman: Morfis, left, from Zante, launched a flurry of blows as he held a pocket knife in his fist after getting into an altercation with the group of boys

In court it was revealed that the taxi driver held a pocket-knife in his fist as he launched a flurry of blows at the group during the altercation.

Several of the teenagers were unaware they had been stabbed until they began bleeding. At least one of the youths was knifed as he tried to run away.

Football-mad Robert, who as a youngster was once a mascot for the then-England captain David Beckham, died in the street on the final night of his week-long trip.
