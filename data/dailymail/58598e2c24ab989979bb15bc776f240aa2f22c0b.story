They say a dog is a man's best friend and it appears these two are getting an early start.

An adorable video has captured the moment an eight-month-old girl, Ella, plays with a two-month-old Golden Retriever puppy after they met in a hotel lobby.

The little girl giggles with glee as the puppy bounds around her, running in circles, nuzzling up against her and licking her face.

Love at first sight: Ella and the two-month-old puppy, who met in a hotel lobby, get along famously

So cute: The dog is gentle with its new eight-month-old friend - making her giggle with glee

She can do nothing but squeal with delight as the energetic pup showers her with affection.

'That's the cutest thing I've ever seen!' a man behind the camera can be heard saying.

The dog keeps urging Ella to play as he wags his tail and licks her hands and head.

At one point, she rolls around with the puppy, resting her head on his belly and hugging him while they lay on the floor of their outdoor deck.

The video, which was uploaded to YouTube in April, has had more than 810,000 views - and while some viewers expressed concern about the boisterous puppy being so close to the baby girl, others said the video had brightened their day.

'I cannot tell you how, after a very 
depressing day how awesome it was to come across these absolutely 
beautiful videos of your beautiful little angel,' one viewer wrote.

Another added: 'Wow! It only took 49 seconds to make this old man cry. What a beautiful video!'

But while Ella and the pup 
seemed to have cemented a close bond, her parents wrote on YouTube that 
the little girl had not seen the animal since, as they met in a hotel 
lobby,

But on Friday, the
girl's mother, Mine Kasapoglu, told the Huffington Post that Ella, who is now two, is still very much an animal lover and enjoys spending time with the family's own dog.
