A Kentucky woman has pleaded guilty to killing an expectant mother and ripping her unborn baby 
from the womb.

Kathy
Coy of Morgantown entered the plea on grounds of mental illness on Friday morning at Warren Circuit Court.

Family and 
friends of the victim, 21-year-old Jamie Stice, appeared in court wearing pink 
ribbons in support of the mother-to-be who was left for dead by the side of a road last April.

Ms Stice's baby boy, Isaiah, survived the attack although he was born five weeks premature. He's now learning to walk, beginning to talk and bears a bittersweet resemblance to the slain woman.

Guilty: Kathy Michelle Coy, seen here last April, pleaded guilty while mentally ill Friday to murdering Jamie Stice in a horrific plot to cut out her unborn baby from her body to claim as her own

Prosecutors say Miss Stice was shocked with a stun gun before having her wrists and throat cut.

Coy faces life in prison without parole at her sentencing on March 1st.

Before Friday's hearing, the boy's grandmother proudly showed off a photo of her chubby, smiling grandson on top of his father's shoulders.

The pictures were the first released of the child who can now say 'mama', causing anguish to the Stice family.

'He looks a whole lot like Jamie when she was a baby,' Mrs Stice said.

Growing up: Jamie Stice's mother posted this photo to a Facebook memorial showing her daughter, seen as an angel, with her baby Isaiah who is now a year old

Touching: Isaiah is seen visiting his mother's grave with his father James Reynolds who he now lives with

Remembered: Stice's baby was five weeks premature

Coy, who had shown little emotion in previous hearings, cried and shook her head on Friday as a prosecutor read the evidence against her.

Her slight, high-pitched voice shook with emotion as she entered her plea to murder, capital kidnapping and kidnapping. She wore an orange jail jumpsuit and leg irons.

'The brutality of it is like nothing any of us have ever seen,' Warren County Commonwealth's Attorney Chris Cohron said.

Mr Cohron said he would have sought the death penalty if Coy had been convicted at trial.

Police had said Coy and Ms Stice were Facebook friends. The victim's mutilated body was found off a dirt road in southern Kentucky on April 14, a day after she had been seen leaving her home with Coy.

Police arrested Coy at a local hospital after she arrived with the infant but showed no signs of having given birth.

Psychologist Eric Drogin testified 
briefly before the plea was entered. Mr Drogin said he met with the 
33-year-old Coy as recently as this week and that she suffers from a 
mental illness.

During a 
hearing in April, Kentucky State Police detective Chad Winn testified 
that Coy had lured the expectant mother out of her home by telling her they were going 
shopping for baby supplies.

After
killing Stice and stealing the baby boy, Coy drove to the home of a 
friend and said she had given birth to the baby, Mr Winn said.

The
friend told troopers that Coy was in a car, wearing no pants and 
sitting on the placenta while holding the baby, who had grass on him.

Left for dead: Jamie Stice, 21, was eight months
pregnant when she was attacked and her mutilated body was found in woodland.  James Reynolds, right, and Stice were no longer together when she was murdered

Growing up: The victim's brother said his nephew, pictured here with father James, 
will grow up knowing about his mother and her hopes for him. She wrote 
letters to her son during her pregnancy that Isaiah will be given

The friend called for an ambulance 
after helping to clean the baby and taking a picture of the newborn. At 
the hospital on April 13, Coy brought in a uterus, ovaries and placenta 
with umbilical cord still attached, along with the baby, Mr Winn said.

Coy initially insisted she gave birth to the boy, then told police she bought the baby for $550, Mr Winn said.

Police searched Coy's home and 
computer, finding links to two pregnant women on her Facebook page. 
Investigators found one of the women unharmed, but couldn't find Stice.

Heartbreak: Jamie's tearful sister Angie, left, and mother Jeannie, right, being hugged by their ttorney, are pictured at court on Friday. They were among the 35 supporters who attended wearing pink ribbons

Police would later find a stun gun and two knives believed to be used in the attack.

'I then asked Ms Coy if that baby was Jamie Stice's,' Mr Winn testified. 'She answered "I don't know," I was alarmed by this.'

Coy was arrested shortly after she arrived at a friend's home with the baby still attached to the placenta and uterus

Coy eventually led detectives to a wooded area off a dirt road, where the victim's remains were located.

Jamie Stice's body was found face down on the ground, disembowelled with her hands tied behind her back the next day.

Her family ran from the courtroom when this part of the detective's testimony was read out last April.

Mr Winn told reporters on Friday that Coy had faked pregnancies and was obsessed with the thought of having a baby.

Coy has two children of her own but they didn't live with her, Mr Winn said.

In
further testimony heard last spring, the detective said that Coy had asked her 
teenage son to help her commit murder but when he refused she said she 
was just joking.

She had told people she was pregnant and had been hatching a plan for months, it was alleged.

She even stole a sonogram photo to help back her claim.

‘She was desperate to prove to everybody that she was pregnant, and I
guess nobody believed her,’ said Ms Stice's friend, Ashley Reeder.

Miss Stice had posted this photo of her bump on her Facebook page, with the caption 'Mommy's Baby Boy'

‘So I think she did this to show everybody that she was going to have the baby when it really wasn't her baby,’ she told NBC.

Her neighbours in Bowling Green were all taken in by Coy’s baby scam.

‘She has been telling everyone that she was pregnant and we had no reason not to believe otherwise,’ said Darla Mueller.

'The miracle in the whole thing is that the baby made it,' Winn said of Jamie Stice's baby.

Jamie Stice's 29-year-old brother Eric marvels at how his nephew has overcome his violent entry into the world.

'He's a miracle,' he said after the hearing. 'He's never had a doctor visit where he weighed in too light.'

Mentally ill: The killer was previously married to Shannon Coy, pictured. She was already a mother of two when she killed Ms Stice, having a daughter and a son from previous relationships

At home, Jeannie Stice 
memorialises her daughter with a wall of photos that recount happy 
times. There are photos of her pregnant daughter and ultrasound pictures
of Isaiah.

Jeannie and Eric Stice were among 35 
relatives and friends of Jamie Stice who came to Warren County Circuit 
Court to witness Coy's plea. They wore pink ribbons.

'There's no justice that can be 
served,' Eric Stice said afterward, calling his sister's killer a 
monster. 'The worst possible thing that they could do to her would not 
suffice the actions she committed. She took a beautiful, innocent young 
lady from a world of people who loved her, including an infant son.'

Stice's brother, Eric, said his nephew will grow up knowing about his mother and her hopes for him. She wrote letters to her son during her pregnancy that he'll be given.

Relatives visit her grave regularly, sometimes taking Isaiah along.

'I'd say it will probably be a tradition to fill him in how much his mom loved him and how much she wanted to be there,' he said.
