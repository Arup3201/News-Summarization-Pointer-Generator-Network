A father-of-two has spoken about the devastating loss of his wife after she developed breast cancer while pregnant.

Mair Wallroth, 41, died just two months after giving birth to her son Merlin, after the cancer in her breast spread to her brain.

Her widower Pete, 33, has now set up a charity to commemorate his late wife and help other parents who find themselves in a similarly desperate situation when expecting a child.

‘Mair was an inspiration to me,’ said Pete, who met his late wife in 2002. ‘The first time I met her I was blown away by her gorgeous smile and positive, fun-loving nature.’

Five years later they married and had their first child, Martha, now three. 

‘In January 2012 we were thrilled when we discovered Mair was pregnant again with a baby boy.’

The pregnancy was going smoothly until 22 weeks when Mair, from Hadfield, Manchester, found a lump in her left breast.

At first, she thought it could possibly be a blocked milk duct, and part of the pregnancy.

But in the middle of June, she received the devastating news that the lump was actually a 6.5cm cancerous tumour in her left breast.

‘I knew something was wrong because she rang me within 20 minutes of her appointment beginning,’ recalls Pete.

‘She already had an indication it was serious. Her mother and father had suffered from breast cancer, as had her two sisters.

‘Terminating the baby wasn’t an option so two weeks later, Mair began chemotherapy – we were told that there is no evidence that a child will be harmed late into pregnancy.’

Mair had four sessions before Merlin was born on 24th September. ‘Doctors would hook her up to the baby monitor so she could listen to the baby’s heartbeat while having chemo.

During chemotherapy, Mair decided to shave off her hair. Pete said: 'Every morning, Martha pretended to be a scarf shop lady, helping Mair choose what to wear on her bald head'

In the middle of June, Mair received the devastating news that the lump was actually a 6.5cm cancerous tumour in her left breast. Two weeks later, she began chemotherapy while pregnant

‘Mair decided to shave off her glossy
 brown hair and we told Martha that she was poorly and as her hair 
would’ve fallen out she didn’t want to make a mess.

‘Every morning, Martha pretended to be a scarf shop lady, helping Mair choose what to wear on her bald head.'

Yet despite being sick and tired from the chemotherapy, Mair was upbeat, smiling just hours before delivering their son, Merlin, weighing a healthy 7lb 1oz three weeks early in September last year.

This time, unlike with Martha, Mair couldn’t breastfeed because she had to start chemotherapy just a week after the birth.

Instead, Merlin was given donated milk from a milk bank.

Mair had a family history of cancer, with several members suffering from the disease which claimed her life at just 41

‘Our main concern was getting back to normal,’ says Pete. ‘Our Macmillan nurse was also like a fairy godmother.

‘But it was hard for Mair. She had post-pregnancy blues, the worry of cancer and she was flattened for a week each time had chemo. Despite this, she never went back to catastrophising – she just got on with it.’

Then, just weeks later, her health began to deteriorate again. 'One minute she was teasing me about all the lists I made, the next she was disorientated,’ recalls Pete.

‘She started getting headaches and blurred vision and went into hospital for scans. But things got worse and worse.'

Following her seventh chemotherapy session, she became very unwell and was admitted to hospital in November with severe migraines, dehydration, sickness and blurred vision.

Doctors feared she was suffering from meningitis, but there was worse to come.

To the family’s horror, tests revealed the cancer had spread to her brain. Given the speed it was growing and Mair’s already poor state of health, doctors broke the heartbreaking news to Pete that the cancer was terminal and Mair had just six weeks to live.

‘It was one of the loneliest things I have ever faced. Once again, our Macmillan nurse came to the rescue, breaking the awful news to Mair when I just didn’t have the strength.

‘I knew that when she heard the word hospice she would know she was dying.

‘The nurse said to her “are you aware what is going on” and Mair replied “will I die”. It was horrendous.’

Pete struggled to hide his grief in the weeks that followed. 

‘I tried to stay strong but moments like watching Merlin sleeping on her chest made me break down.

‘But Mair told me off and to stop crying, saying she’d had two wonderful kids – her purpose in life.

She was very compassionate and gave all her time to everyone else. Even up to her death, her attitude was always ‘never mind’ me.

Mair died aged 41 on 6th December last year. Merlin was just two months old and Martha was just three

Pete said: ‘I took Martha to see her the day she died. Mair held her hand, and told her she loved her.

‘Mair’s sister Louise and I were in floods of tears.’

‘At her funeral we wore rugby tops and party frocks like she would’ve wanted. ‘We still celebrated Christmas that year – I wanted the kids to have some normality.’

Ten months on and Merlin is now one. ‘He points to photos of Mair and tries to say “Mummy”,’ says Pete.

‘I’ve kept a special box for him with the scarf and necklace Mair wore when he was born.  I told Martha that Mair had turned into fairydust and was a star that followed her around.

'Sometimes she says: ‘Why can’t I click my fingers and Mummy will reappear?’ It’s heartbreaking.’

Determined for some good to come of his wife's death, Pete has set up a charity charity in her memory to support other women who get cancer while pregnant

Determined for some good to come of his wife’s death, Pete has set up a charity charity in her memory to support other women who get cancer while pregnant.

He said: ‘Even in the darkest hours, it always struck me how fortunate we were. The housing association where I work let me take time off, we were given donor milk and our friends and family rallied round.

‘I thought about other families going through what we were – what if they hadn’t had what we had?

The charity, called Mummy’s Star, offers advice on dealing with the practicalities of life for women who are pregnant and suffering from cancer, those treated for cancer within of year of a birth and people who in the first year after pregnancy lose a spouse.

Pete said: 'Mair told me I needed a project to focus on - and I don’t want her to have died in vain.'

Pete is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s campaign to ensure no-one faces cancer alone. For more information or to donate visit www.macmillan.org.uk or call 0808 808 00 00. For information on Mummy’s Star visit www.mummystar.org
