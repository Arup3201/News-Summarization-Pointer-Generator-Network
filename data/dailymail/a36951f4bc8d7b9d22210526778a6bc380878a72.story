Two teens who survived a horrific car crash that took the lives of six friends on Sunday escaped danger when they kicked out a window swam to safety after they plunged into a lake.

The eight teens were driving in Warren, Ohio, when the Honda Passport suddenly struck a guardrail, leaving the road and falling into the lake below.

When the SUV turned upside down in the water, Brian Henry, 18, and Asher Lewis, 15, made their way to the back of the vehicle, kicked out the back window and made it out alive.

Henry and Lewis then ran a quarter-mile to the nearest home to call for help.

Brian
said that the impact caused his head to slam against the dashboard, 
knocking him out at first, but he was awakened when the cold water began
rushing into the SUV.

He got out of his seat and tried to kick out the back window, but it wouldn't break at first.

Brian told WYTV:
'First thing I thought was that I just wanted to give up. I was like, I
can't go out like that. It took me six or seven times to bust the 
window.'

'I wasn’t thinking
about myself,' he said. 'I was thinking about the other lives that were
left behind to get them help. I didn’t care if I was busted up. I just 
had to get help there first.'

Victims: The SUV's driver, Alexis Cayson, 17, and Andrique Bennett, 14, were among the six teenagers killed in the car crash

Grand theft auto: The SUV that left the road and crashed into the pond, killing the six teens, was reported stolen on Monday

It was revealed on Monday that the owner of the SUV was stolen, and that the teen behind the wheel was speeding and may have been drinking.

On Monday, the SUV's owner, Marquis Stephenson, met with police and filed a stolen-car report; police said none of the teens were related to the owner or had asked to use the vehicle.

Brian backed up the speeding claim, saying that he had asked the driver, Alexis Cayson, 19, to slow down moments before the crash.

He told WYTV: 'I'd 
been telling her to slow down. Before I turned around and looked at her,
the car had jerked out of control. I don’t know if she did it on 
purpose or how fast she was going.'

None of the teens were wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash.

Five of the victims, aged 14-19-years, were found trapped inside the vehicle, which came to rest upside down in a swamp and sank after the shocking one-car crash 60 miles east of Cleveland.

A sixth teen was thrown from the SUV during the crash and was discovered under it when the car was pulled from the water.

Investigators said they believe excessive speed was a key factor in the crash, which took place in a 35 mph zone alongside a steel mill near what's known in the neighborhood as 'Dead Man's Curve.'

Authorities did not say how fast the SUV was going. They were also awaiting the results of drug and alcohol tests.

Ohio authorities on Sunday identified
the six teenagers killed, along with the two boys who were able to 
escape from the overturned sport utility vehicle after it landed in the 
pond.

The Ohio State Highway Patrol do not believe the eight people inside the vehicle were closely related.

Killed
were 19-year-old Alexis Cayson; 14-year-old Andrique Bennett; 
14-year-old Brandon Murray; and Kirkland Behner, Daylan Ray and Ramone 
White, all 15. All six were from Warren, in northeast Ohio.

While the father of one of the dead 
said the teenagers were coming home from a sleepover at a friend's 
house, the mother of another boy killed said that her son and his best 
friend had lied about staying over at each other's homes that evening.

She said she thinks they went to a party.

'If only he had listened,' said Lisa 
Williamson, mother of 14-year-old Brandon Murray. 'I told him, `Don't 
you go nowhere.' But they're kids.'

She said that her son called late Saturday night and said he was staying at the home of his best friend Ramone White.

She said it wasn't until after the accident that she found out that wasn't true.

'It's what we did when we were growing up, too,' said Williamson, who was wearing a rubbery 'Jesus Loves You' bracelet that she took off her dead son's wrist.

Andre Bennett Sr., whose son Andrique was among those killed, said that his son and the others had all stayed over at a friend's house and that a girl offered them a ride home.

Chris Jones, 16, said he used to see most of the victims every day at school and in their neighborhood. He knew all but two in the crash.

'They're not always the best kids. They're not out there looking for straight A's,' he said. 'But none of these kids should be where they are today. This should have never had happened.

'All I know is my baby is gone,' Derrick Ray told CBS at the crash site after viewing his 15-year-old son Daylan's body at the county morgue.

Major crash: The SUV they were in struck a guardrail, turned over and went into the pond

Two of the teens were brought to a hospital in full cardiac arrest and were treated for hypothermic drowning trauma, indicating they had been submerged in cold water

He said he knew his son was out with friends but didn't know they would be traveling.

Daylan was a star football player who was looking forward to playing in high school, he told the news station.

A
makeshift memorial was piling up yesterday at the stretch of road where
the teens were killed. Family and friends were leaving teddy bears and 
notes after the tragic wreck.

Daylan's half sister Mariah Bryant, who only learned he was her brother last year, was particularly distraught.

'It hurts, it really does, because they are so young and, like, they could have had so much more to life,' she said. 'We just really started getting close, and it's hard to believe he's gone.'

Rickie Bowling, 18, a friend of Kirklan Behner, broke down at the scene as she recalled her pal.

'He was one of a kind,' she told CBS. 'Everyone knew him in the neighborhood. In school, he always made everyone laugh. Basically, enjoy every second in life. Enjoy life while you've got it and while you're here and enjoy people that you love.'

The
Honda Passport vehicle carrying the eight teenagers crashed into a 
guardrail Sunday morning, overturned and landed in the pond in northeast
Ohio, Lieutenant Anne Ralston of the Ohio State Highway Patrol said.

What remains: Both airbags were deployed in the crash, but it did little to help the teens, who were not wearing seatbelts

Early morning emergency: The highway patrol received the first call on the crash at 7:15 a.m.

Warren Fire Department Capt Bill Monrean said a cold water rescue team was deployed to the scene and got five teens out of the sunken vehicle.

'Being a cold water rescue situation, cold water extends life,' Monrean said. 'We knew we had a chance; even being in there a while.'

Two of the teens were brought to a 
hospital 'in full cardiac arrest,' St. Joseph Health Center nursing 
supervisor Julie Gill said, and were pronounced dead there.

She said they were treated for hypothermic drowning trauma, indicating they had been submerged in cold water.

The two teen boys who survived were treated for bruising and other injuries and released, she said.

The
highway patrol received the first call on the crash at 7:15am, 
Ralston said. Divers helped the patrol, and local police referred calls 
seeking information to the patrol.

Officials the victims' school to offer counseling for their families and friends on Sunday night.

Superintendent Michael Notar told CBS the crowded closed-door session was heartbreaking.
