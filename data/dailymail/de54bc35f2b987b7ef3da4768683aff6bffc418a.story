Sometimes the most ambitiously creative projects can deliver the most awe-inspiring results.

Ukrainian indie band Brunettes Shoot Blondes said they wanted to produce an animation to compliment their simple track Knock Knock and they produced an innovative video to achieve this.

The group produced a simple animation across at least 16 Apple devices which was anything but simple to complete.

Protagonists: The two protagonists in the unique animation video are a man with a rabbit head and a woman

Focusing on two characters, the spectacular video shows them crossing between a multitude of Apple devices to tell a love story. 

Speaking about the number of required takes to capture the footage Brunettes Shoot Blondes said it 'took dozens and then add 50'. 

They have produced a mesmeric animation which features a man with a rabbits head chasing the woman of his dreams through an array of Apple devices. 

Chase: The man runs after the female continuously throughout the amusing video

The talented group used eight iPhones, five iPads, some iPod shuffles and two Macs to produce and bring the compelling animation to life.

The humorous and highly original video was shot on an iPhone. 

'We had an idea of graphic elements that would interplay between the gadgets,' band member Andrew Kovaliov told Dezeen. 

'So then we created the characters and started to work on synchronisation of the video fragments downloaded on different devices.' 

Animation through devices: The characters move through a myriad of Apple devices during the animation 

Stairs: The female character runs down a set of stairs while the man-rabbit character chases her

Following the story of a man chasing his lover through a series of different scenes to try and catch up with her, the animation sees the two characters start off on separate iPhones.

They then progress onto iPads, passing through an iShuffle on the way and move on to the two Macs.

As the song reaches its conclusion, the two lovers finally meet on the same screen. 

Car: The unfortunate man-rabbit finds it extremely difficult to keep up with the female character

Happy conclusion: At the end of the video the female character drops into the man's arms 

This was created as a music video for a song by Ukrainian band Brunettes Shoot Blondes. You can see more of their work on Soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/brunettesshootblondes
