On a clear day, it is said that visitors to the Shard can see France.

But despite the panoramic views offered by scaling Europe's highest building, it is poor value for money in comparison to other skyscrapers across the world.

A 'height to price' ratio, balancing adult admission price against the height of the buildings, reveals why some visitors to the tower of steel and glass have felt aggrieved at the weighty admission costs.

Poor value: The Shard, Europe's highest building, is the worst value for money for those looking to experience views from some of the world's most well-known skyscrapers. The graph measured the cost of admittance on the door for one adult against the height of the buildings

Pricey: Adults visiting the Shard, which opened to the public earlier this month, can expect to fork out £29.95 ($47) on the door

Having opened to the general public earlier this month, adults visiting the £500m building can expect to fork out £29.95 ($47) on the door.

A family of four will be charged more than £87 for the 30-second elevator trip to the building's 68th floor viewing platform.

But standing at only 800ft (244m), the Shard's viewing platform compares poorly against other global skyscrapers offering the chance to gaze at stunning vistas.

The best value can be found at Taiwan's Taipei 101 building, with a viewing platform at 1285ft (392m), costing an adult only £9.70 ($15.25).

Huge: The building, standing at an impressive 1,016ft, has 72 occupiable floors,

Other buildings providing significant Empire State Building in New York and the Willis Tower in Chicago with a viewing platform at 1,353ft (412 metres) costing £11.45 ($18) for an adult on the door.

Toronto's CN Tower boasts an observation deck at 1,122ft (342 metres) costing £20.45 ($32).

Despite criticisms of the Shard's entrance fees, and indeed its design, its views across London - said to stretch 40 miles with good visibility - have been described as the most sought-after views in the UK.

The building has 72 occupiable floors, but with further floors narrowing to a point, and it stands as high as an
87-storey building, scraping the sky at an impressive 1,016ft.

First look: The first visitors to the top of the Shard enjoy the view over a wet and rainy London February 1

Alternatives: Among the buildings offering better value than the Shard, are the Taipei 101 building in Taiwan, left, and New York's Empire State Building

It is comfortably six times 
taller than Nelson’s column, but still 438ft short of the Empire State 
Building; and it is dwarfed by the 2,717ft Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the 
world’s tallest building.

The skyscraper is part of a 2m sq ft development in Southwark called London Bridge Quarter.

The Shard and its sister development The Place are linked with London 
Bridge Station through a new central plaza, public realm, bus station 
and train station concourse.

The Shard’s tenure at the top of the European height chart is likely to 
be short-lived, as the 1,089ft Mercury City Tower in Russia is set to be
completed by the end of the year.

A spokesman from The View from The Shard said: 'It is a premium visitor attraction, providing a unique, queue and crowd free experience of one of the world’s greatest cities. Its prices are in line with fast-track ticket prices for many other visitor attractions in London and around the world.

'As the highest vantage point from any building in Western Europe, and almost twice as high as any other vantage point in the city, it is the only place where you can see the entire city of London at once.'
