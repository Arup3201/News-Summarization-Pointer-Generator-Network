Britain's largest supplier of caviar is being investigated after one of its most desired products was apparently mislabelled as top-grade caviar when it contained a cheaper quality type. 

King's Fine Foods, which supplied the incorrectly packaged caviar to Harrods and to Fortnum & Mason, which is the grocer to the Queen, is now under investigation by Richmond Council after a DNA sample taken during a routine inspection of their premises revealed the product had been mislabelled.

Among other high profile customers are Buckingham and Kensington palaces, the Ritz, the Groucho Club and Claridge's, although it is not thought that they were sold any of the batch.

The practice of mislabelling caviar could be widespread, as even the most discerning palates appeared to have failed to identify the lesser sturgeon roe, experts warned yesterday.

One of the two DNA samples taken from the supplier’s premises in October was from King's sevruga caviar, priced at £1,280 per kg.

An analysis revealed that a tin marked as sevruga, the name for roe from the acipenser stellatus breed of sturgeon, contained roe from acipenser ruthenus - a cheaper breed whose eggs are considered inferior.

King's has removed the product and sent all its other caviar products for DNA testing, according to the Times.

Laura King, the founder and co-owner of King's, said the company had bought the batch in good faith and had asked her supplier for DNA evidence that the sturgeon farmed was stellatus, but she had not received any.

She said she contacted Harrods and Fortnum & Mason to say that 'there might be a problem with the Sevruga'.

She added: 'Ms King said: 'As a result of this incident, we have written to all our other suppliers, asking for DNA tests to support our purchasing. 

'With the exception of a farm in Canada, all the suppliers who have responded to us have informed us that they consider DNA testing unnecessary as they are experts in the farming of the fish concerned. 'Although we value and take very seriously these assurances, we have already taken the decision to implement our own DNA testing programme, to ensure that our customers can be certain of both the nature and quality of caviar that they buy from us. 

'The results of our testing programme will be regularly published on our website and sent to all our trade customers.  I am sure that all the other caviar dealers in the UK will now want to follow suit in this regard. '

The caviar trade is now putting pressure on the BBC to re-edit a scene in a forthcoming episode of The Apprentice, in which the winners are given a King's caviar tasting.

The tasting features the mislabelled sevruga and.

Lucia Fortucci of the BBC's complaints department wrote: 'If you feel that the BBC is endorsing a company which is engaged in an illegal activity it is up to you to bring your complaint to us following the broadcast.'

Fortnum & Mason, Harrods, and King's Fine Foods did not return calls from MailOnline requesting a comment.
