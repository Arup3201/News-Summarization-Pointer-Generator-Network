Brave: The photograph of John Tulloch's bloodied and bandaged face became one of the defining images of the 2005 London bombings

A survivor of the July 7 terror attacks whose courage was praised by Prince Charles faces deportation from Britain.

The photograph of John Tulloch’s bloodied and bandaged face became one of the defining images of the 2005 London bombings.

After visiting him in hospital, the Prince of Wales said he exemplified the ‘resilience of the British people’.

But the academic is now facing expulsion from this country – despite being born to British parents in a British colony, marrying a British woman and having two British sons.

The 70-year-old university lecturer has had his passport confiscated and fears he will be forced to leave the country where he has lived and worked for most of his life.

Describing the situation as an ‘insult’ to his forebears, he said: ‘This is harder than 7/7 and it hurts me far more than that day has ever done. I am about to be thrown out of the country.

‘There I was, hailed as an example of British courage, British pluck and British spirit, an iconic image of British resistance ... then I get kicked out.’

Professor Tulloch was sitting opposite July 7 ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan when the suicide bomber detonated his explosives on a Tube train.

The image of the dazed lecturer emerging from Edgware Road station, his face burned and his clothes shredded from the force of the explosion, was beamed around the world. 

He suffered serious injuries to his ear drums and still has post-traumatic stress disorder from his experiences.

The
 academic was born to a British Army officer and his wife in India and 
can trace his British ancestry back to the 14th century.

He
 was raised and educated in Britain from the age of three, has held a 
series of posts at British universities and owns the flat where he lives
 in Penarth, near Cardiff.

But unknown to him, his birth in colonial India meant he was classed as a ‘British subject without citizenship’. 

He was issued with a British passport and said he was never told he did not have citizenship.

After a degree at Cambridge he embarked on an academic career in Britain.

He later accepted a job in Australia and was granted Australian citizenship.

Professor
 Tulloch said his British passport stated he could take out dual 
nationality without putting his British nationality in jeopardy.

But
 when he applied to renew his British passport it was confiscated and he
 was told his right to live in Britain was cancelled when he was granted
 Australian citizenship.

He was able to return to the UK under a work permit and went on to hold a professorship in communications at Brunel University and was head of the School of Journalism at Cardiff University.

But as he approached semi-retirement, he said he was told he cannot live here permanently, and can only visit as a tourist.

The Home Office told him he could not apply for naturalisation as a British citizen, he said, even though his older brother has full citizenship.

Professor Tulloch said he considered their actions an insult to the years of service given by his family to Britain.

His father was a major in the Gurkha Rifles and was fighting in Burma at the time of his birth and his grandfather and great-grandfather both worked for the British government in India.

He said: ‘I am totally gobsmacked by this. My family served Britain for three generations. I’ve been banging my head against a wall trying to get this sorted out. It’s like Kafka. I look back now, on the verge of being thrown out of residence in the UK, at something like 120 years of my family’s distinguished service to Britain in India. This isn’t simply an insult to me, but to generations of my family.’

Professor Tulloch’s case  compares with those of at  least 11 foreign-born terrorists who have been excused deportation after serving prison sentences on the grounds that their human rights would be at risk.

AUK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘It is the responsibility of an individual to check that they will not lose a previously acquired nationality or citizenship on acquiring an additional one.’
