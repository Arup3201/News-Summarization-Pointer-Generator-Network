When Lee Garrels rushed to hospital to help after hearing a young man from her close-knit community had been electrocuted on a building site, she had no idea of the horror that was awaiting her.

Ms Garrels, a nurse educator from the small town of Clermont, in Central Queensland, was heartbroken to discover the critically injured patient was her son, Jason. 

It was just weeks before his 21st birthday.

Childhood: Jason Garrels, pictured left, as a youngster.

Her husband, Michael, also rushed to the hospital - and they watched their son, a trainee electrician, die.

Clermont is a small, tight-knit community, and the people who were working to save young Jason's life knew him well.

'Everyone that worked on Jason knew him,' Mr Garrels said. 

'It was terrible.' 

Jason was electrocuted at a local building site. 

But two years and many months since the incident, the family still does not have the full picture of what happened because there has not been a coronial inquest to confirm the facts of his death.

'Not in a million years,' Mr Garrels said, would they have thought it would take this long.  

Younger days: Jason Garrels. 

Under Queensland law, an inquest cannot be held until outstanding court matters have been resolved.

In Jason's case, one cannot go ahead until a case involving his employer, Daytona Trading, is resolved.

Mr Garrels has described Jason as a polite young man who 'couldn't do enough for people'. 

He was a 'larrikin' who would taking delight in 'putting s*** on dad'. 

'He was what you would describe as a typical young Australian,' Mr Garrels told Daily Mail Australia.  

He believes an inquest could make findings that could save the life of someone like Jason. 

And he has amassed a huge amount of support in his campaign to have the Coroners Act changed. 

He said: 'It (Section 29 of the Coroners Act) is a bastard of a law. 

'It's no longer relevant.'

A petition on Change.org had garnered nearly 70,000 signatures at time of publication. 

'This family needs to be given the opportunity to start to heal and that won't happen until they get answers to why their beautiful son was lost in such tragic circumstances,' wrote one signatory. 

Another added: 'Every parent should know the details of the death of their child.' 

Mr Garrels recently met Queensland's top legal officer, Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie. 

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Bleijie said Garrels' death was a tragedy.

'We do not tolerate unsafe workplaces and, following an investigation by my department into the incident, nearly $100,000 worth of fines have been issued, contractor licenses have been suspended and one matter is still before the court,' he said.

While he would not comment on any matters before a court, Mr Bleijie said he was currently considering advice from the Coroner, including reviewing the appropriate section of the act. 

Mr Garrels is hopeful the law will be changed. 

'We have already tabled a petition from the Clermont community about Section 29,' he said. 'I think the Newman Government has stated they feel they need to listen to people more.'

'They've changed a lot of legislation with a lot less backing than what I have now on Change.org,' he said
