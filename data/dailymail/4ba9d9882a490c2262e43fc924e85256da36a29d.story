A teenager has been suspended from school after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager.

Nikita Morrison, 13, was in a French lesson when she put the bottle of Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy on her desk while unpacking her school books.

But teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days.

Controversy: Nikita Morrison, 13, who has been suspended from Gloucester Academy for bringing in the drink

She claims staff at Gloucester Academy considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product’s website stating it is suitable for children.

The alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops.

Ms Morrison, who has never been excluded before, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it.

‘You see kids at school drinking it all the time, even the Year 7s, there is nothing wrong with it.

‘The teachers told me I wasn’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager. I told them it was pop but they just wouldn’t listen.’

Anger: Nikita's mother, Amanda (right), has described her suspension as 'absurd' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons

Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops.

No ID is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the UK Food Standards Agency.

Her mother Amanda, 38, said the incident on Wednesday was ‘absolutely ludicrous’.

‘It is absurd, the staff were saying it was alcohol.

‘She has missed quite a few lessons now, it is ridiculous. She is special needs so she is dropping behind even more.

Safe: The shandy that Ms Morrison brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops

‘It find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop.

‘Despite the fact we have explained, and proven, that it is not alcohol the school won’t listen at all.’

The stay-at-home mum-of-nine added: ‘There is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all.

‘I tried to explain that it was my mistake and I bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough.’

Alan Armstrong, interim headteacher at Gloucester Academy, defended the exclusion.

He said: ‘This school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons. Schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe.’

A Ben Shaw’s spokesman said: ‘Shandies with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption.

‘All products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling.’
