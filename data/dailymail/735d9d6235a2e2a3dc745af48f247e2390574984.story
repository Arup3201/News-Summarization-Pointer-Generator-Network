Britain's militant postal union yesterday warned of ‘inevitable’ strikes as the dispute over plans to privatise Royal Mail becomes increasingly bitter.

The Communication Workers Union said a strike is ‘inevitable’ unless a deal is agreed between its members and the Royal Mail.

Despite the union’s upcoming ballot, the Government said it will not alter its decision to sell shares in Royal Mail in this financial year.

Strike threat: The Communication Workers Union will be voting on potential industrial action this month, with its leaders saying a strike is 'inevitable'

The Royal Mail said industrial action, or the possibility of disruption, was damaging to the business, especially in the run-up to Christmas, which is the busiest time for the company.

The ballot will take place on this month and will see 125,000 of CWU members balloted over pay, jobs, pensions and the impact of any sell-off of the Royal Mail, with industrial action possible from October 10.

The Department for Business today expressed its disappointment that the CWU are set to ballot for strike, adding that industrial action ‘isn’t necessary.’

‘The CWU leadership are standing between their members and a generous pay offer of 8.6 per cent over three years, which is more than teachers, nurses and our armed forces, who have had pay increases capped at 1 per cent,’ a Department for Business spokesman said.

Going for the vote: Dave Ward, Deputy general secretary of the CWU, says his members are at a breaking point

‘Action taken by the CWU will not alter the Government's decision to sell shares in Royal Mail in this financial year.

‘Parliament decided over two years ago that selling shares in Royal Mail was the right thing to do to secure Royal Mail's future and protect the six-day-a-week universal postal service.

‘A successful, financially sustainable Royal Mail with access to private capital is in the best interests of the workforce and all users of the universal service.’

Dave Ward, CWU deputy general secretary, said his union members had teached a ‘breaking point’ and accused Royal Mail of ‘relishing’ in the prospect of privatisation.

‘Royal Mail continues to prepare for privatisation with relentless rounds of budget cuts in offices across the UK.

'There is no understanding that the pace of change can really only be led by how hard people can work, and CWU members are being driven to absorb absences, carry increasing amounts of mail and work harder than is possible in many cases.

‘We have reached breaking point, particularly in delivery offices, and the culture has to change.’

It will be the first national postal ballot since a pay and conditions dispute in 2009.

The union said it had rejected a below-inflation pay offer linked to accepting major changes to working conditions and pensions.

A number of local disputes have broken out, with the union warning that budget cuts are stretching workers ‘to the limit’ and 96 per cent of its members recently voted against privatisation.

A similar percentage even said they would be prepared to boycott delivering competitors' mail.

Royal Mail managers in the Unite union have also voted strongly against the planned sell-off.

CWU members working in Post Offices will not be involved in the ballot, although they have been taking strike action in a separate row over closures, jobs and pay.

A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘Royal Mail is very disappointed that the CWU has issued a timeline for a national ballot for industrial action, if an agreement is not reached in on-going talks.

Crippling action: Royal Mail said a strike in the weeks before Christmas, its busiest time of the year, would significantly damage the company

‘Discussions over a new three-year agreement between Royal Mail and the CWU are continuing. We are committed to reaching an agreement with the CWU as soon as possible to give our customers and employees continued stability. We believe that focusing on the possibility of industrial action is inappropriate.

‘A ballot for strike action does not mean there will be a strike; currently it is business as usual for Royal Mail. Any industrial action, or the possibility of disruption, is damaging to our customers, and our business, especially in the run up to our busiest time, Christmas.

‘Royal Mail operates in a very competitive market, especially in the parcels market. We recognise that customers have a choice and can move their business quickly.

‘Royal Mail will do all that we can to protect our business and our customers' mail. We will work hard to minimise the impact of any industrial action on our customers.’

Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Strike action would be unjustified, highly irresponsible and would hit businesses hard. It would serve only to undermine the reputation of the Royal Mail at a time when the focus should be on making the most of the privatisation process.’

All Royal Mail and Parcelforce workers in the CWU will be balloted from September 20, with the result due on October 3.

If there is a yes vote, the union would have to give seven days' notice for strike action.
