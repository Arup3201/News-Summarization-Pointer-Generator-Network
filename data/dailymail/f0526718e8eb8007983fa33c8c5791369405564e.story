Argentina's president Cristina Kirchner has caused outrage by saying that diabetes afflicts the rich because 'they eat a lot and live sedentary lives'.

She revealed her ignorance of the illness on Tuesday during a presentation on the country's science technology and innovation programme, called 'Innovative Argentina 2020', which took place in her Buenos Aires presidential home La Casa Rosada.

After explaining that an Argentine laboratory was exploring and developing new treatments for diabetes that she hoped would help create jobs , she said: 'There are 80 million diabetics in the world and they also have high purchasing power', reported Argentine newspaper.

She added: 'Diabetes is an affluent person's disease because they are sedentary and eat a lot.'

Diabetes is a group of metabolic 
diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the 
pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not 
respond to the insulin that is produced.

As the news of the comments filtered out, people took to Twitter to express their disbelief and embarrassment, reported La Nacion.

One tweet read: 'This 
causes me so much shame' while another sarcastically said that while 
Venezuela's interim president Nicolás Maduro is talking about the 
importance of finding a cure for cancer, Kirchner is talking about 
diabetes and the upper class.'

It comes as President Kirchner welcomed the new Argentine Pope, Francis I, via a televised address in which she appeared to be gearing up to use his powerful new status to Argentina's advantage with regards the Falklands Islands.

In the address Ms Kirchner 
said she hoped the new Pope would 'take a message to the major world 
powers that they need to participate in dialogue.'

It
is feared that if Argentinians interpret the latest development as an 
intervention by God on their side, it could be a catalyst for 
nationalism.

Tensions between Argentine and 
British governments grew last year as the 30th anniversary of the war 
for control of the South Atlantic islands approached.

Meanwhile
military chiefs have drawn up plans for a 'show of force' to warn off 
any Buenos Aires sanctioned-aggression after Falkland Islanders voted to
remain under UK sovereignty in a referendum this week.

After wishing her compatriot luck, 
Kirchner said: '(We hope) that (his mission) takes the message to the 
major powers in the world to participate in dialogue ... that the great 
powers in the world, who have arms and financial power, can be convinced
to finally heed the emerging countries and that they commit to a 
dialogue of civilisations where things are resolved by diplomatic 
channels rather than by force.'

She
added pointedly: 'We ask God that he help make it possible that just 
causes also sometimes triumph in this blessed land we call Earth, 
because I am sure that God and the Virgin also wish it so.'

President
Kirchner's relationship with the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires has 
until now been thorny, the two having engaged in open battle over gay 
marriage.

Despite their 
apparent differences, the two share a hostile rhetoric when it comes to 
the islands. As recently as 2010 Bergoglio declared: ‘The Malvinas are 
ours.’

Kirchner has already said that she hopes the new Pope will take a message to the world's powers telling them they can't ignore the emerging countries
