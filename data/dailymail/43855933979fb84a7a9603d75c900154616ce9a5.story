After the US rugby team failed to match New Zealand in Chicago on Saturday, the American press then failed to identify the legendary All Blacks correctly in the press.

The 74-6 win at Soldier Field must have shocked the hosts, with the Chicago Sun Times newspaper referring to them as the 'legendary Aussie team' in a report.

The mishap was reportedly the talk of New Zealand's flight over from the States to England ahead of this weekend's international at Twickenham.

The All Blacks warmed up for that Test by running in 12 tries in a crushing victory at the weekend.

The tries - through Nathan Harris, Cory Jane, Patrick Tuipulotu, Williams (two), Charles Piutau, Julian Savea (two), Joe Moody, Aaron Cruden, Israel Dagg and Sam Cane - show Steve Hansen's side are on devastating form ahead of the Autumn Tests against England, Scotland and Wales.

Elsewhere, Joe Launchbury has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a neck injury, plunging England’s preparations for the autumn Tests at Twickenham into turmoil.

The 23-year-old Wasps lock has been suffering from a persistent neck problem, caused by a nerve irritation, and his country have reluctantly had to accept that he will miss the four-match series against the Kiwis, South Africa, Australia and Samoa.
