Proud moment: Reeva Steenkamp poses with her friend Angus Hayes on her graduation day at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in 2005

The girlfriend of Blade Runner Oscar Pistorius was due to make a heartfelt Valentine's Day speech to schoolchildren just hours after she was gunned down at the Paralympian's home.

FHM cover girl Reeva Steenkamp, 29, was expected to tell pupils that she had previously been in an abusive relationship.

She was due to reveal that it had been this relationship - and the resultant 'loss of self worth' - which prompted her to move to Johannesburg to rebuild her life.

But the law graduate never made it to the school.

Instead, she was found riddled with bullets at Pistorius's luxury home after allegedly being shot dead by the double amputee in the early hours of that morning.

In a somewhat cryptic message, she was due to warn the secondary school pupils in Johannesburg: 'No matter how many people say that they "love" you, if you do not love your person then you will never step outside of the physical you.

'The physical you can only do so much if your mental you is lost inside of all the confusion.'

In her notes for the speech, which can be seen in full below, she said it 'took some serious soul searching to remind myself of my value in this world.'

She said she enjoyed a 'blessed and privileged' upbringing on a small farm outside Cape Town, but later met a man who was abusive, which she suggests was caused because his 'mother was abusive to him'.

However, she does not reveal any further details.

She intended to finish her talk by telling them: 'Go home and tell your parents, siblings, neighbours that they are appreciated.

'You will go to bed with a happy heart and open mind for the future.'

The speech was set to take place the day after she excitedly tweeted about her own plans for Valentine's Day.

The model asked her followers on Twitter: ‘What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow??? #getexcited.’

She added: 'It should be a day of love for everyone. May it be blessed!'

Tragic twist: Miss Steenkamp was due to make a heartfelt Valentine's Day speech to schoolchildren just hours after she was gunned down at boyfriend Oscar Pistorius's luxury home

Diverse career: Having graduated with a law degree, Miss Steenkamp went on to become an FHM cover girl

Earlier today, Pistorius broke down in tears in court as he was formally charged with Miss Steenkamp's murder.

The star held his head in his hands as one count of murder was read out to him in Pretoria Magistrates' Court.

He did not enter a plea, but his family and management company later said he disputed the allegation 'in the strongest terms'.

According to media reports in South Africa this morning, security guards at the complex found Pistorius by Steenkamp's body in the bathroom after she had been shot four times through the door.

It came as a new picture emerged of the Miss Steenkamp beaming with pride after graduating with a law degree in 2005 from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University.

She is pictured in robes with Angus Hayes, one of her friends who also graduated from the Faculty of Law that year.

Happy: Reeva went on Twitter the day before she was killed to say how excited she was about Valentine's Day

He described her today as 'genuine with a loving nature'.

'You were always kind and gentle and perfectly mannered, a true lady without question,' he said.

'I
 never met your father Barry, of whom you spoke with so much affection 
and pride, but I am fortunate enough to know your dear mom June and I 
can only thank her for her gift to the world.

'She gave you such strength and love that you never ran out of energy to shine for us.

'Thank you for everything you did for me and for all the lessons.'

He added: 'You were so busy after university fretting about becoming a success that you never stopped to see that that you already are one.

'Forget riches and post-grads and titles. What better mark of success can there be than to add as much love to the world as you did? You were so special.

'My dear Reeva, you lived your life as you appeared to the world.

'You lived it beautifully. Our memories of you, this invisible light that you always gave to us so selflessly, will help us navigate our lives forever.'

Too much to bear: Blade Runner Oscar Pistorius weeps in the dock as he is formally charged with the murder of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at Pretoria Magistrates' Court

Worldwide attention: The hearing came after a two-hour delay while Oscar Pistorius's lawyers objected to the scrum of reporters that packed into the courtroom

Miss Steenkamp was about to embark on 
the next stage of her dynamic and varied career, this time as a TV star,
 when she was killed.

Born
 in Cape Town on August 19, 1983, she later moved to Port Elizabeth as a
 child where she grew up with her mother June and father Barry, a 
racehorse trainer.

After graduating, she made a dynamic career change after being scouted and named the first face of cosmetics giant Avon South Africa.

She became a keen horse rider but broke her back in an horrific fall six years ago, suffering injuries so severe that she had to learn to walk again.

Her rehabilitation may have brought her into Pistorius's path, and friends said she had admired his single-minded determination to race.

She moved to Johannesburg six years ago and since then has travelled between the city and Cape Town to film and shoot some of South Africa's leading campaigns and commercials.

Toyota, FHM, Clover and Italian brand Zui are some of the more prestigious clients she has worked for.

Speaking in an interview in 2012, she said: 'At the end of last year I made an application to the Bar.

'It was a nerve-wracking experience. As I walked out I got the call for the FHM shoot as well as two others. I made a decision to take the modelling shoots. I believe in destiny and faith.'

This weekend, Steenkamp was set to star in South African reality television series Tropika Island Of Treasure, in which celebrities and ordinary people compete in remote, exotic locations in a variety of daily challenges.

Below are the rough notes Miss Steenkamp made for the speech at Sandown High School, a co-educational government school in Johannesburg.

They are reproduced exactly as she wrote them.

'PE' stands for Port Elizabeth, the town on South Africa's south coast where Miss Steenkamp grew up, while 'Jozi' is South Africa's commercial capital Johannesburg.Who received flowers/chocolates/cards/messages/tweets/etc today (February 14) for Valentine's Day?

Tell them what I received, make a small joke about this. And then tell them that receiving those things is very special but not receiving anything doesn't define you as a person or make you less valued!!!

1. I was raised on a small farm just outside of Cape Town. In a way I was blessed and privileged to be away from the pressures of city life and I grew up to appreciate the simpler things above the superficial.

2. I will chat about life on the farm, having no money but being blessed with amazing parents who never allowed me to be aware of my circumstances. Some 'looking back now' points somewhere after this would fit in.

3. After moving to PE and deciding to study Law despite our financial situation, I worked hard to be acknowledged as one of the top 15 per cent academics at university so that my studies could be 80% covered by bursaries and I worked to pay off the rest.

4. I broke my back towards the end of varsity. Learnt mobility again and made a massive life decision with regards to my career. I will elaborate on this part of my journey.

5. I was in an abusive relationship at the same time (his mother used to abuse him) and all together these factors encouraged my move to Jozi.

6. Despite my height disadvantage and the difficulty in general of breaking into the modeling industry, I put my head down and worked hard towards my dream.

7. I lost a lot of self worth during my last year in PE before I moved to Jozi and it took some serious soul searching to remind myself of my value in this world.

8. Being loved by others, although an amazing feeling to have the appreciation of others, does not define your place in the world.

9. Accept who you are. Acknowledge your absolute 'CAN DOS' in life and work on your 'MAYBES' so that you can be a better person for the ultimate upliftment of those around you.

10. No matter how many people say that they 'love' you, if you do not love your person then you will never step outside of the physical you. The physical you can only do so much if your mental you is lost inside of all the confusion.

11. Be brave. Always see the positive. Make your voice heard. Your physical seen. And the presence of your mental you felt. Its that culmination of your person that will leave a legacy and uplift.

12. I hope that you have the most amazing VD and that you are spoilt with love and roses and chocolates. Go home and tell your parents, siblings, neighbours that they are appreciated. You will go to bed with a happy heart and open mind for the future
