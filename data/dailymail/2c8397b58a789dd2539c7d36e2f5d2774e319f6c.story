Members of the United Nations' aviation agency are holding high-level safety talks for only the second time in 70 years after hundreds of air passengers and crew were killed in a series of high-profile tragedies in 2014.

The disastrous year has prompted government and aviation officials from dozens of countries to gather in Montreal this week for an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) assembly to discuss the risks of flying over conflict zones and how to prevent planes from vanishing.  

Malaysia is leading a push for sweeping changes after its state-owned flag carrier, Malaysia Airlines, suffered two air disasters within five months last year.

Malaysia wants mandatory reporting of conflict zone risks after a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down

The Southeast Asian country is pushing for real-time aircraft tracking and calling on the UN to force its member states to warn airlines about the risks of flying over conflict zones.

One of Malaysia Airlines' planes disappeared and has not been located, and another was shot down over eastern Ukraine, where the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian rebels are still involved in a heavy battle for territory.  

All 298 passengers and crew were killed when flight MH17 was shot down while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur last July. 

Since that incident the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has faced pressure to develop new systems to share intelligence and warn airlines about new threats associated with conflict zones.

Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director general of Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, said a proposal to create a central website where states and agencies could voluntarily publish warnings does not go far enough.

Speaking at the ICAO assembly, he was quoted by Reuters as saying that reports from ICAO member states should be ‘mandatory and timely’.

He added: ‘We cannot delay implementing changes in the way global commercial aviation operates.’

The ICAO’s proposal is backed by the US and Netherlands, which lost 196 citizens when flight MH17 went down.

The Netherlands also wants airlines to tell passengers before take-off whether their flight will cross a conflict zone.

The US said MH17 was hit with a ground-to-air missile fired by rebels, but Russia insists that the aircraft was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet.

It was flying at about 33,000ft after Ukraine had warned airlines to remain above 32,000ft.

Malaysia is also pushing for real-time aircraft tracking to become an industry standard, despite the costs.

Search teams have found no trace of flight MH370 despite scouring 25,000 square miles of ocean

It follows the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which was carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Despite extensive search efforts in the Indian Ocean teams have been unable to find any debris or the plane’s black boxes. 

In a working paper presented to the assembly, Malaysia said: ‘We believe, based on our unfortunate experience, (it) will be offset by the benefits of enhancing the effectiveness of the alerting and search and rescue services.

‘The disappearance of MH370 demonstrates the crucial need to improve aircraft tracking systems for the sake of safety and security.

The ICAO assembly is likely to endorse a plane tracking system that sends signals every 15 minutes

‘In this day and age, the fact that an aeroplane could go missing and that the flight recorders could be so difficult to recover is unacceptable.’

Despite Malaysia’s demands the ICAO conference is likely to back a less-costly system that sends tracking signals every 15 minutes, but would increase the intervals to every minute in an emergency or if a plane deviates from its route.

Current standards require long-haul flights over water to report their position about every 45 minutes.

Delegates are also studying how ejectable and buoyant black boxes would assist rescuers and investigators when a plane crashes.
