Louis van Gaal has revealed that the Manchester United team chef has been helping his side prepare for their Premier League clash against Liverpool on Sunday. 

Van Gaal will be taking charge of a team at Anfield for the first time in his career and it will also be a new experience for several of his players, like Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao.

They have not been short of advice, however, with Ryan Giggs and the team chef preparing them for what to expect.

The occasion is set to be even more highly-charged than usual with both teams competing for a Champions League place and just two points separating them in the Premier League table.

Van Gaal said: ‘I have always my assistant manager to say that to me. And he said that also to the players in his presentation of the analysis of Liverpool but I also have the cook, Mike, and he is saying that every day to the players and to me.

‘I like that because that shows that it is a very particular match especially for the fans of Manchester United and it helps also to focus and concentrate on this match.

‘Liverpool is not the ground that Manchester United has won a lot (at) so when we show it again in Liverpool then we are a little bit further, I believe.’

United have had Chris Smalling and Angel di Maria sent off in big games against Manchester City and Arsenal this season, and Van Gaal warned that they have to keep their cool at Anfield.

He hinted that he has deliberately been winding them up in training to test their temperaments.

‘I am the referee in the games that we have had on the training pitch and I have whistled in the way that they have to control their aggression, for example,’ he added.

 ‘To prepare them already the atmosphere. And I have mentioned that to them after lunch. Control of emotion is also a talent.’
