Jason Dufner was sitting in a classroom with children for a charity 
event when he leaned against a wall and zoned out for a minute.

That's all it took for one photo that went viral and made Dufner a Twitter sensation.

Dufner, dressed in a red golf shirt, is shown slouched against the 
wall at J. Erik Jonsson Community School in Dallas, next to two children
who are listening intently to the teacher.

In the image that launched the meme, Jason Dufner leans against a wall during an appearance at J. Erik Jonsson Community School

A good sport, Dufner retweeted several pictures of people mimicking him

Even Dufner's fellow golfers got in on the act

His legs are erect, his arms
stiff at his side, and he has a vacant look on his face. Dufner is 
known for showing little emotion, even with a major championship at 
stake. He looks even more lifeless in this photo.

'Just caught me at a perfect time,' Dufner said Friday from Auburn, 
Ala. 'The funny thing about it is the photo taken represents how I act 
all the time. It was a sheer moment of 'Jason Dufner' by whoever 
captured the moment for the 30 seconds I checked out.'

That would be Christine Lee of KXAS-TV, a video journalist for the 
NBC affiliate in Dallas who was covering Dufner's appearance at the 
school.

Dufner won the Byron Nelson Championship last year. The Salesmanship 
Club of Dallas, which runs the tournament, directs some of its 
charitable proceeds to the school for disadvantaged children.

To drum up
publicity as the defending champion, Dufner made an appearance at the 
school Thursday.

Not everyone who dufners does it on purpose

People from all walks of life were amused by Dufner's slouch

He never imagined where it would lead.

Lee took a photo of Dufner in that perfect moment and gave it to sports anchor David Watkins, who posted it to Twitter.

Among those who saw it was Keegan Bradley, who beat Dufner in a 
playoff for the 2011 PGA Championship and has been engaged in friendly 
banter over the last month. And it took off from there.

Dufner's name became a verb. It's call 'dufnering.'

Luke Donald tweeted a photo of a pillow under his shirt as he 
slouched against the wall in his home.

Rory McIlroy was dufnering in his
hotel room, and he couldn't stop talking about it Friday at the Houston
Open.

Dufner is known for his stoic expressions on tour

At one point in his round, he walked behind the 13th green, saw a
reporter and said, 'Did you see the Dufner photo? How good is that? 
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen!'

Bubba Watson was dufnering against his General Lee 01 car.

Dufner 
even got in on the act Friday, dufnering in the weight room at Auburn.

Those who think it's an example of a professional golfer who couldn't
be bothered spending time in a classroom with children were missing the
point. Dufner always looks that way. Even in the PGA playoff at Atlanta
Athletic Club, he didn't appear to have a pulse.

In an era when players don't always return to the cities where they 
won, Dufner participated in two media days in one week. He was in New 
Orleans on Wednesday (the Zurich Open was his first PGA Tour win), and 
then headed to Dallas for the classroom.

The subject?

'They were talking about focusing and relaxation,' Dufner said, a 
master at the latter. 'They have some big test coming up for the class 
on ways to relax and concentrate. And I guess I took it to another 
level.'

Since the image went viral, a siege of imitators posted photos of themselves 'dufnering'

After all the Twitter photos of people 'dufnering,' the man himself finally replied.

'What can I say, I was tired, my back hurt from sitting on the floor,
and we were talking about relaxation and focusing. (hash)dufnering' he 
tweeted.

By then, it was all the rage.

Dufner thought nothing of the charity event until he arrived at the 
airport and noticed the photo had been posted on Deadspin. Bradley took 
over from there.

'Every time I looked at it, I laughed harder than the first time,' 
Bradley said from the Houston Open. 'Dufner is so funny with some of the
things he does. That's him.'

Bradley said he has never seen his Twitter account fill up with 
thousands of pictures and responses, and he was stunned to wake up 
Friday morning to see that 'dufnering' was trending on Twitter, 
especially during the NCAA basketball tournament and American idol.

When he arrived at Redstone on Friday morning, he got together with 
Dustin Johnson and Brandt Snedeker for a 'dufnering' pose by the putting
green.

'I saw a basketball player doing it in the locker room,' Snedeker 
said. 'I never knew Dufner had such a wide range of appeal. His 
personality is not a welcoming personality. But once you get to know 
him, he's actually one of the funniest guys you'll ever meet. He just 
doesn't give you anything on the golf course.'

Dufner said he slouched down because he'd been sitting for hours and his back hurt

Snedeker's impression of the photo?

'It looks like someone put him in timeout,' he said.

Dufner, however, figures he's getting the last laugh. Hardly anyone 
knew who he was two years ago. Then, he lost a four-shot lead with three
holes to play in the PGA Championship and wound up losing to Bradley in
a playoff.

He handled the loss with dignity and — as always — no 
emotion. A year later, he won in New Orleans and Dallas in the span of a
month, and played on his first Ryder Cup team, winning three of four 
matches.

'I think Keegan tried to use it against me but it blew up in his face with all the publicity,' Dufner said with a chuckle.

So what's next? Dufnering at Augusta National during the Masters?

'Oh, for sure,' McIlroy said. 'I would 'Dufner' on the lawn. No. On the tree out back by the clubhouse.'

About the only person not caught up in all the hype is Dufner's wife, Amanda.

'She gets to see me 'dufnering' the most,' Dufner said.
