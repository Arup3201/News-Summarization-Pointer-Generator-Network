Dogs dressed as screen stars and sirens from classic science fiction movies and TV shows were unleashed on an unsuspecting London yesterday.

The costume-loving canines were in fancy dress as part of Sci-Fi London, a week-long annual convention that takes place at Stratford Picturehouse in east London.

Owners dressed up their pets as their favourite characters and paraded them around Theatre Square, to the delight of other science fiction and superhero buffs.

One of the dogs was Harvey, a long-haired Chihuahua, who was dressed as the iconic Darth Vader from the original Star Wars trilogy.

Meanwhile Missy, a Chorkie, was dressed as Doctor Who's robotic companion K-9 by owner Ross Myhill.

On the superhero theme there was Ty, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier dressed up as Superman, and Betty, a Teacup Chihuahua, was literally a Hound Dog when she appeared as Elvis Presley.

Betty also thrilled sci-fi fans when 
she donned the famous bun haircut sported by Princess Leia, who was
played by actress Carrie Fisher in the original Star Wars trilogy.

Some of the costumes were a little more esoteric, such as Harry the Pug who was dressed as Leeloo, portrayed by Ukrainian actress Milla Jovovich in the Luc Besson film The Fifth Element.

The
best dressed dogs won a bag of goodies and a framed print of their 
photo. Festival organisers urged owners that the animal's welfare is their foremost concern.
