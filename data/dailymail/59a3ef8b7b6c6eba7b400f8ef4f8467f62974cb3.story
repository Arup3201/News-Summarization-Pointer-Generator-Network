A 20-year-old New York college student is facing heaps of Internet scorn after she published an essay demanding that poor people stop making her feel bad because she's so rich.

Rachael Sacks describes how a cashier at her local grocery store in the affluent West Village neighborhood was unfriendly and frowned at her because she was carrying a large shopping bag from the high-end handbag designer Mulberry.

'I am sorry that I was born into great financial circumstances and my father likes to provide for me. I am sorry I don’t have to go to a state school to save my parents money. What do you want from me?' she writes in an essay, published on Thursday, for Thought Catalog.

'People shouldn’t make others feel bad about their own personal finances. How people spend their money is their own choice.'

She continues: 'It just seems really petty and makes you look bitter and unhappy with your own life if you are casting nasty glares at college girls in Gristedes because you’re a cashier.'

The 20-year-old then argues: 'I’m not one of those people who try to be poor to relate to people.

'I think that’s honestly really disgusting behavior, it’s as if you’re saying that you have to make yourself into something you think is beneath you to get others to like you.'

She later claims she had no idea that she was rich while growing up because her family went to McDonalds and she wore clothes from Old Navy.

She added: 'I went to private school when I was younger and there would always be someone so much richer than me.

'There were kids who owned their own horses and whose parents were billionaires, so I had no idea that I had any money until I was about 14 and people called me ''Rachael Sacks of Cash''.

The student has penned other articles entitled '13 Things That Should Exist For New York Women In Their 20s' and 'Confession: I'm a chronic female masturbator'.

On her blog, her ambition is stated as: 'Working on my goal of being a rich eccentric old person by writing a lot of things.'

Calls to a cell phone number for Miss Sacks went to answerphone when contacted by MailOnline today.

Her
 younger sister Caroline told MailOnline today that her sister is 
currently in New York and going to school. She said that she was unaware
 if her sister had any part-time work or internships.

Within hours, Miss Sacks was flooded with deriding, mocking comments from people who didn't appreciate her take on wealth.

'Yes, let's all pity and feel bad for poor, judged, not smiled at,' one twitter user commented sarcastically.

A commenter on her story wrote: 'What a spoiled brat. Your parents did a horrible job of raising you. The level of entitlement in this article is mind blowing. No one is born spoiled, entitled and snobby.' 

'That is a learned behavior. And it's 
repugnant. I hope that you can modify your behavior before you pass your
 horrible and selfish attitude down to your children,' another commenter
 adds.

Miss Sacks responded in fury at the negative responses her personal essay had drawn on Thursday.

She posted on Twitter: 'I've been dealing with b****** since the third grade I've always been ready for haterz.'

She adds: 'I'm just an obnoxiously loud voice of idiocy amongst billions.'

Gossip site Gawker piled on with a post headlined 'Rich Girl Not Going to Pretend She's Not Rich Just to Make Poors Happy.'

Miss Sacks attends the private Eugene Lang Liberal Arts College at the New School in Manhattan.

With tuition and fees totaling nearly 
$40,000 a year and annual cost of attendance estimated at more than 
$61,000, it has been ranked as one of the most expensive college in the 
country.

Her father is Dr Preston Sacks, a prominent fertility doctor in Bethesda, Maryland. The family lives in a $700,000 home in Bethesda, Maryland.

Despite the massive influx of online criticism, Miss Sacks doesn't appear to have changed her mind.

She tweeted: 'I'm rolling my eyes because I definitely don't deserve this much attention.'

Adding later: 'La la la everybody hates me guess ill eat some worrrrmmmsss. Suck it.'

Sacks was unrepentant in the face of criticism, telling her 'haters' to 'suck it'
