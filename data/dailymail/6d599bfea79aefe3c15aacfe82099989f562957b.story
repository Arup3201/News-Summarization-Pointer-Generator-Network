Australia's top-rating AFL commentator Dennis Cometti has announced he will hang up the boots at the end of the 2016  season.

The man many regard as the 'soothing voice' of AFL said he will not look to extend his time as a caller beyond 2016, because of age, and because he believes television networks won't be interested in offering him a new contract. 

Cometti, 65, said that the AFL and its broadcasters will look to take a new direction in 2017 when the new television rights deal is signed.

'I'm 65 now and I can't imagine doing it beyond the current agreement. That'll be the end for me, I'd say,' he told The Herald Sun.

In a career spanning almost 40 years, Cometti  mastered the art of commentating down to a tee.

Unlike some of his colleagues who raise their voice for affect, Cometti has a softer, smoother tone which is much easier to distinguish from other commentators in the game. 

It's even been said he has the soothing manner of a dentist when speaking behind the microphone.

The former player-turned-commentator played for West Perth in the WAFL and Footscray in the then-VFL, and coached briefly before he turned to a career in sports media.

Dennis Cometti was regarded in various public polls as the game's best AFL commentator

He started calling for the Seven Network In 1986 and shortly after became one of the highest profile commentators in the game.

In an interview on his impending retirement with The Herald Sun, the 65-year-old said he has never borrowed from other commentators and has never been drawn in to using cliche sporting phrases.

'I try to avoid other people's cliches. If I can think of a few of my own, I just use those.' 

Various public polls have pitted him against other callers to decide the game's best, and more often than not Cometti comes out on top. 

He said he never borrowed lines from other commentators and did not use cliches

When asked about a public poll which revealed he was the sport's most popular commentator during the 2014 season, Commetti replied: 'It's certainly better than the alternative.'

'When people (in the street) approach me they are fantastic.' 

'There have been only one or two bad experiences over the years.'  

But none of those he has shared with long-time friend and legendary AFL commentator Bruce McAvaney, who he has called alongside for years.

'There has never been a harsh word between us. We are good friends.'

When Channel Seven regained the rights to broadcast AFL games starting from 2007,  it was announced a year earlier that Cometti had re-signed on the basis that he was to commentate alongside McAvaney. 

As a player Commetti played in the WAFL and VFL for West Perth and Footscray. 

He said the toll of travelling interstate most weekends and staying in hotel rooms was the biggest factor in influencing his decision to quit.

'It's not the football, it's the travel,' the Perth resident said.

'I've worked out that I've spent five years of my life in a hotel. Age does come into it.'
