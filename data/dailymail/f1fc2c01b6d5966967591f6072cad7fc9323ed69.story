Rihanna's NFL performance was canceled at the Baltimore Ravens game on Thursday following the  release of a video showing ex-player Ray Rice knocking his fiancée unconscious.

The singer was herself the victim of a high-profile 
domestic violence incident back in 2009 when she was assaulted by her 
then boyfriend Chris Brown.

CBS' Thursday Night Football, featuring the debut game of Pittsburgh Steelers at 
Baltimore, eliminated a track of Jay-Z's, Run This Town, featuring 
Rihanna and Kanye West - along with other 'high energy' elements and a comedic stint, NFL officials said.

Rihanna stepped out in New York on Thursday for Fashion Week after her song was cut from the opening of NFL Thursday Night Football following the Ray Rice domestic violence incident

Former Ravens star Ray Rice is shown in May with his wife Janay at a New Jersey courthouse to face charges of domestic violence. He was let go from the Baltimore team this week after the full video emerged from the incident showing Rice punching his then-fiancée unconscious

CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus said that the changes were made to give the game coverage a more 'subdued' tone and journalistic approach.

The broadcast was to open with a report by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell 
about Rice, who was cut by the Baltimore Ravens after TMZ released the 
surveillance video on Monday.

The footage has called into question how the NFL disciplines players 
involved in domestic violence. Earlier, Rice had been suspended from two 
games for the assault.

Asked if Rihanna's own history as a victim of domestic violence was a
 reason the song was cut, McManus said it was among several factors 
considered but was not the overriding one.

Rihanna, who was pictured on Thursday attending New York Fashion week, was attacked by 
then-boyfriend Chris Brown before the 2009 Grammy Awards and was forced to cancel her appearance. 

A leaked photograph obtained by TMZ showed visible injuries to Rihanna and Brown, 25, later pleaded guilty to felony assault.

How the network will approach next week's broadcast has yet to be determined, McManus said.

CBS Sports had previously announced that Run This Town with added 
narration by Don Cheadle, was to accompany each of the 2014 broadcasts 
as part of an opening sequence that would be customized for each week's 
game.

TMZ claimed in a 
Thursday report, that 'CBS didn't want to feature another celebrity who 
was involved in a high-profile domestic violence incident'.

CBS
 planned to open its broadcast on Thursday of the NFL game between the 
Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens with a segment featuring 
Rihanna singing the Jay-Z tune Run This Town.

The NFL pre-game segment was scrapped after video obtained by TMZ emerged earlier this week of Ravens star running back Rice, 27, punching his now-wife in an elevator in February and knocking her unconscious.

The Ravens terminated Rice's contract after the video emerged and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended the player indefinitely.

CBS acquired the rights to broadcast eight games on Thursday night this season in a partnership with the NFL Network.

CBS shelved a pre-game segment that featured Rihanna following the controversy over the Ray Rice domestic violence video - partly due to the singer also being a victim of abuse at the hands of Chris Brown
