Child rapist: Mohammed Hussain, 28, pleaded guilty and has been jailed for six years and eight months

A takeaway worker faces deportation after he was jailed for raping a 12-year-old girl who was out past her bedtime.

Mohammed Hussain, 28, was driving home from work with two colleagues in the early hours in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when they spotted the group of four girls in a park.

Afraid to go home because they had broken their parents' curfew, the girls were enticed back to the home of one of the men.

There they were offered cannabis and played pornographic films before two of the girls, both 12, were taken upstairs.

Hussain raped one of the 12-year-old girls while she asked him to stop, Leeds Crown Court heard.

One of his two colleagues, 30-year-old Harris Uddin, tried to remove the trousers of the other girl but stopped when she asked him not to.

The four girls - two aged 12, one aged 11 and one aged 13 - were at the home of the third takeaway worker, 28-year-old Shah Miah.

Although he did not assault the girls himself, he was jailed for helping arrange the attack after he struck up conversation with them.

He is also now serving a four-and-a-half year sentence for sex offences against three other children.

The court heard all three men, who were arrested later the same day, groomed vulnerable youngsters for their own sexual gratification.

Hussain pleaded guilty to rape and was jailed for six years and eight months.

Uddin pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was jailed for 12 months.

Attack: The four girls were out past their curfew in the area of this park in Leeds, West Yorkshire

Miah pleaded guilty to facilitating the commission of a sexual offence against a child and was jailed for 18 months.

The attack happened in the Leeds suburb of Beeston last March.

Hussain and Uddin, from India, were already in the country illegally because they had outstayed the length of their visa, the court heard.

Det Supt Pat Twiggs, Leeds head of crime for West Yorkshire Police, said: 'These men preyed on these vulnerable young girls in a premeditated way to sexually exploit them.

'The circumstances of the offences included grooming behaviour leading to the appalling sexual abuse of victims that were clearly underage.'
