Dozens of hirsute men have descended on Bath for the annual general meeting of a club that celebrates moustaches.

The Handlebar Club, founded in 1947, includes about 100 members from Britain, as well as dozens of international moustache aficionados.

About 40 men have gathered for the weekend away at the Lansdown Grove hotel.

The club was founded in 1947 and all you need to join is a real moustache - no beards allowed

The club has members from around the world, including Dan Sedererowsky, who flew in from Sweden for the weekend

Secretary Steve Parsons said: 'The qualification for membership is "a hirsute appendage of the upper lip, with graspable extremities" and in addition, we specify that beards are not allowed.'

Barry Copson, a 44-year-old carpenter from Leicester, said: 'When I joined in a pub in London, the secretary reached over, took both ends and gave it a good, hard tug.

'They have known gentlemen who try to join with moustache extensions, like those hair weaves that ladies have, so they have to check.

Club member Gary McCann showed off his neatly-kept moustache

'I'm a reasonably young man and I'm a carpenter, so during the week I don't wax it out and I'm just a guy with a floppy moustache.

'But if I'm going out, I may well wax it up and always notice people do a double take.

'I expect a reaction because with a ridiculous moustache you do stand out.'

To qualify for membership, the moustache must have 'graspable extremities', as Conrad Amis shows

Members also wear the maroon club tie, emblazoned with white printed moustaches, to every club meeting, as seen on Allan Robinson

The club was founded 63 years ago at the Windmill Theatre in London's Soho

Members pay £20 a year to join and wear the maroon club tie, emblazoned with white moustaches, to every meeting.

The club, which also raises money for charity, was founded in the dressing room of actor Jimmy Edwards at the Windmill Theatre in London's Soho.

Beards are banned in the Handlebar Club - it's strictly moustaches only, as shown by Tom Cutler from Brighton

Membership is £20 a year as long as the moustache passes the grabbing test
