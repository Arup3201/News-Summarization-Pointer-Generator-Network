A police officer was so determined to get justice for an elderly war veteran robbed in his own home that he studied law in his spare time to force reluctant prosecutors to act.

Detective Constable Stephen Hopkins was appalled when the Crown Prosecution Service refused to take action against a woman suspected of stealing £600 from 85-year-old Edwin Stout.

But instead of accepting its decision, he researched the law and consulted a Cambridge professor to prove it was possible to charge the alleged thief, even though the only witness – Mr Stout – had died.

Impressive: Detective Constable Stephen Hopkins, left, from Warrington, was honoured for his determined out of hours work to secure a conviction for World War II hero Edwin Stout who died after an attack in his own home

DC Hopkins’ perseverance paid off when a woman of 21 was jailed more than two years after the crime.

His hard work and dedication was 
recognised last night when he was named runner-up in the UK’s first-ever
Police Federation National Detective Awards.

The 38-year-old, who serves with the 
Cheshire Constabulary, said: ‘I wanted to get justice for the victim and
his family – I couldn’t let the attacker get away with it.’

Mr Stout, who served in the RAF during
the Second World War, and was battling cancer, was targeted in a 
distraction burglary in Warrington in November 2007.

A woman, claiming to be from the 
council, conned her way into his home before letting in her male 
accomplice. The pair then assaulted Mr Stout and fled with £600 in cash.

Fingerprints were discovered in the 
house but no immediate match was found and, in the days after the 
incident, Mr Stout asked for the case to be dropped because he was too 
ill to pursue it.

High level advice: DC Hopkins contacted Cambridge University law experts in his drive for justice for war veteran Edwin Stout

He was battling both lung and prostate cancer.  He 
moved in to a residential home and died five months later.

In May 2009, a young woman was 
arrested following a violent dispute and her fingerprints matched those 
taken from Mr Stout’s home.

She was interviewed but denied 
involvement, claiming instead that Mr Stout had attempted to sexually 
assault her. She later admitted lying and confessed she was present 
during the robbery but denied taking part in the violence.

However, the CPS refused to charge her
because of human rights laws which state that a defendant’s lawyer 
should be allowed to cross-examine the only witness.

But once Mr Stout died, police had 
only hearsay evidence in statements from his daughter and granddaughter,
whom he phoned immediately after the robbery, and the first police 
officer at the scene.

DC Hopkins said: ‘I started studying 
the law on hearsay. I looked into English case law, European judgments 
and the principles of the Criminal Justice Act, in relation to when a 
witness has died.’

DC Hopkins also contacted Cambridge professor John Spencer, an expert on hearsay evidence.

Prosecutors relented and in early 2010
the woman admitted robbery and was jailed for four years. Her 
accomplice is still being sought.

The case is now used as an aide in the training of prosecutors.

Mr Stout’s granddaughter Julie 
Drabble, 36, said her family were extremely grateful to the detective. 
‘He went above and beyond his duties,’ she said.

Mr Hopkins’ boss, Chief Superintendent
Richard Strachan, said: ‘This is an excellent detective case, it is a 
little bit like an episode of Morse, but this is reality.’

DC Hopkins won a commendation by 
Cheshire police authority – its highest accolade – before being 
nominated for the national award.
