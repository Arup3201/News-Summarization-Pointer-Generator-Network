Three-time champion Ryan Moore underlined his status as one of the world's best jockeys with a four-length win in Tuesday's Melbourne Cup on German-trained Protectionist.

Second was Ed Dunlop's Red Cadeaux, remarkably filling the runners-up spot in Australia's greatest race for a third time in four years.

But the race was marred by the death of two runners. Japanese-trained favourite Admire Rakti collapsed after finishing last while seventh-placed Araldo was spooked by a flag-waving spectator and sustained a irreparable leg fracture when kicking out and striking a fence.

Moore finished ahead of Ed Dunlop's Red Cadeaux to claim victory in Australia's premier racing event 

The incidents provoked a backlash by animal rights groups in the country who have campaigned against the Cup using the slogan 'Is the party really worth it?'

The near last-to-first success for Moore on the Andreas Wohler-trained Protectionist was the rider's 14th at Group One level this year. They have been achieved in six different countries.

Moore, who won Australia's Cox Plate on Aidan O'Brien's Adelaide last month, said: 'I've got to thank (my wife) Michelle at home because I've been away a lot. You need to win these races for it to be worthwhile. It's very special.'

Meanwhile, back in Britain ante-post prices for God's Own winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase were flying around after his victory in the Haldon Gold Cup but trainer Tom George has warned he might pursue a novice chase route with his Exeter winner.

The six-year-old retains his novice status because his only previous win over fences in the Grade One Ryanair Novices' Chase at the Punchestown Festival on May 1 fell on the first day of the British 2014/5 jumps season.

After God's Own's five-length win from Balder Succes, George said: 'I am not saying he won't be given entries in the big two-mile races but we have options.'

The Henry VIII Novices' Chase at Sandown on December 6, the same day two-mile chasing's big guns Sire De Grugy and Sprinter Sacre are due to clash on the card in the Tingle Creek Chase, could be God's Own's next race.

Haldon fourth Cue Card tired after a 313 day absence. He will now try to win Haydock's Betfair Chase for a second year running.
