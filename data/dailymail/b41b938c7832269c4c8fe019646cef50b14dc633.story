Are you desperate to lose weight but constantly hungry when dieting?

Does the thought of going to the gym fill you with dread?

A new diet promises to avoid all of this – while allowing you to eat foods traditionally banned on weight loss plans.

Called The High Fat Diet, it claims to facilitate up to 10lb of weight loss in just 14 days.

Developed by nutritionist and personal trainer Zana Morris, the diet is a combination of high-fat nutrition and high-intensity training.

The premise is that rather than fat being demonised, it actually makes you thinner.

In a nutshell, you need to eat fat to get rid of fat.

The High Fat diet promises up to 10lb of weight loss in 2 weeks - because fat stabilises insulin levels 

Over 12 years, Ms Morris has seen thousands of people lose an average of 6-8 lb (2.7-3.6 kg) and 1-3 inches (2.5-7.5 cm) from around their middle, in as little as two weeks.

‘Some lose as much as 12lb (5.4 kg)’, she says.

And, as the plan is designed to help reset the hormonal balance of the body, she claims it’s also easy to keep the weight off.

In a new book about the plan, Ms Morris says: 'It literally turns every­thing you thought you knew about weight loss on its head.

'Forget counting calories, feeling hungry, hours of exercise or months of watching the scales slowly shift downwards, and forget bran or anything else that tastes like cardboard.'

Instead, those on the plan eat plenty of high-fat foods - like nuts, avocado, butter and even cream cheese.

They also do a maximum of 12 minutes of exercise a day - none of which is on a running machine or exercise bike.

Here, in an extract from the book, The High Fat Diet, the authors explain the science...

HOW EATING FAT MAKES YOU THINNER

The reason the diet works is the impact fat has on a hormone called insulin.

Released when you eat, insulin's job is to shuttle glucose, the sugar our body normally uses for energy, into cells where it can be used as fuel.

How much insulin you produce depends on which foods you consume.

Sugar and carbohydrates (which your body converts quickly into glucose) produce the highest level.

Protein, which takes a bit more effort to turn into glucose, creates a smaller rise.

• You lose weight: On average 6-8 lb (2.7-3.6 kg) in two weeks.

• You lose inches: Usually 1-3 inches (2.5-7.5cm) off the tummy and waist and more elsewhere.

• Your skin looks amazing: Fat plumps up skin and by the end of the plan you could find your skin is glowing and fine lines and wrinkles have virtually disappeared.

Dietary fat, however, takes a few complicated steps to convert to glucose and therefore doesn't trigger any direct rise in insulin at all.

Swap to a diet that consists of a lot of high-fat foods and very few carbohydrates and you create a situation where insulin is low and you remove your body's normal source of fuel.

At this point it has to do something to get the energy it needs, and that something is to switch to using fat instead (a state scientists call ketosis).

Every time a little bit of fat leaves the cells to be used as energy the fat cells get smaller and lighter - and so do you.

THE FILL-UP FACTOR

Hunger is a common reason people find diets hard to stick to, but it's very hard to be hungry eating just fat and protein.

One reason is that ketones released as you start to burn fat suppress appetite.

The combination also avoids sudden peaks and troughs in blood sugar that cause food cravings.

Finally, fat digests slowly, keeping you fuller longer.

Can you imagine what difference that would make to eradicating 3pm sugar cravings?

Fat is also mentally satisfying. 

We enjoy eating it and many people on low-fat diets miss the creamy sensation it offers.

Fat is also mentally satisfying, claim the experts behind the diet. 'Humans are programmed to enjoy eating it and many people on low-fat diets miss the creamy sensation it offers,' they say

Combining the physical effects on blood sugar - and the psychological boost of being able to eat a food most of us enjoy- can make diets containing fat more satisfying and easier to stick to than low-fat regimes.

But is it OK to eat all this fat?

Well, much of the fat you're eating on the plan comes from sources of unsaturated fat that no expert is going to argue are bad for you - avocados, walnuts, oily fish and olive oil

However, you are also adding in foods like butter, cream cheese, red meat and full-fat cheese, which contain saturated fat.

For the last 65 years, intake of saturated fat has been blamed for high cholesterol, heart disease, obesity and more. 

However, a number of scientists and cardiologists are now disputing this.

Last year, for example, University of Cambridge scientists analysed a group of 72 studies looking into the risk of saturated fat and heart disease.

This revealed no difference in heart-disease risk between those consuming the highest and lowest intakes of saturated fat.

This led the researchers to suggest more trials are needed to confirm officially whether saturated fat is good or bad.

ALL CALORIES ARE NOT EQUAL

A strange thing happens when you eat lots of fat that seems to boost weight-loss results.

On our high-fat plan you could be eating 1,500 to 2,500 calories a day and still lose about 1/2 lb a day (often far more) – that’s more than should be theoretically possible.

Experts call this 'the metabolic advantage'.

This describes the anomaly that when you eat a high percentage of calories from fat in a diet, you seem to increase the number of calories you can consume yet still lose weight.

AND THE EXERCISE?

High-intensity workouts, lasting 10-15 minutes, have been validated by numerous studies as one of the most effective ways of not only decreasing body fat - but also increasing muscle mass, strength, performance and endurance.

This type of training helps stimulate muscle fibres, increases metabolism post workout and activates release of a muscle-building and fat-burning hormone called human growth hormone (hGh). 

When it comes to body sculpting, hGh is vital.

To produce the highest hGh levels though, scientists say there are three key things you need to do:

1. Train using large muscle groups

2. Train at a high intensity- that means with heavy weights or at speed

3. Train with the shortest rest intervals between sets

So that's the type of plan you're going to be doing.

No wonder you only need 12 minutes daily to get results - you're working hard and working effectively. 

But don't be fooled: just because it's short, doesn't mean it's easy.
