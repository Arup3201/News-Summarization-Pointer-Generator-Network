Excavation: Guido Lewandowski, a member of VBGO, digs out the remains of a German soldier at a former army headquarter in Klessin, Germany

The remains of a German soldier killed during the Second World War have been unearthed during an excavation by volunteers dedicated to giving dignified burials to the war dead.

Bones and personal belongings were dug up during the excavation near the eastern German town of Klessin, which lies about 50 miles east of Berlin.

The area around the small town which lies close to the Polish border was the place of a
 battle between German and Soviet forces between February and March 
1945 - part of the final push into Germany known as the Battle of Berlin.

As many as 200 of the soldiers who were part of the conflict are still missing 
today - instigating the dig.

The excavation was carried out by members of The Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe who have been carrying out digs to help identify those killed in both the First and Second World Wars.

Known in Germany as Vereins zur 
Bergung Gefallener in Osteuropa or VBGO, the group is made up entirely 
of volunteers, many of whom are from Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Ukraine and the US.

Since they were founded in 1992 the group has recovered more than 7,000 sets of remains all over Europe.

But due to the level of decomposition they are only able to identify around 25 per cent of those discovered.

Findings: Personal belongings including glasses were also discovered during the groups most recent dig

The group have dug up the remains of a number of nationalities and they state: 'We are not looking for soldiers of the Wehrmacht, not for U.S. GI's, 
Marines, soldiers of the red army or Polish Military- not for infantry 
soldiers, sailors or airmen- not for good or bad.

'We are looking for people - sons, fathers, brothers.'

The not-for-profit association has now carried out 100 searches since they were formed 20 years ago and now has more than 200 members. 

The dig in Klessin,
 which belonged to a defence line during the Battle of Seelöw Heights,
 was the seventh carried out this year, following excavations in Poland 
and Russia.

The area was defended by 800 German soldiers, against three Soviet-divisions during the war.

The overall offensive saw the Germans outnumbers by almost ten to one, as a million soviet soldiers took part in the final push that hastened the end of the Second World War.

The Battle of the Seelöw Heights (fought over three days, from April 16 to 19, 1945) was a part of the one of the last assaults on large entrenched defensive positions of the Second World War,

Known as  Seelow-Berlin Offensive Operation (which lasted until May 2, 1945), this battle is often incorporated into 
the Battle of the Oder-Neisse - only the 
opening phase of the Battle of Berlin, which was the name given to the final push of the Soviet forces into the German capital at the end of the war.

Seelow Heights was where the most bitter 
fighting in the overall battle took place, but it was only one of 
several crossing points along the Oder and Neisse rivers where the 
Soviets attacked.

Close to one million Soviet soldiers, commanded by Marshal Georgi Zhukov, attacked the position known as the 'Gates of Berlin'. They were opposed by about 110,000 soldiers of the German 9th Army, commanded by General Theodor Busse.

By the end of 19 April, the German Eastern Front line had ceased to exist. All that remained were pockets of resistance, and the road to Berlin was wide open for the final assault.

Four days later the capital Berlin was encircled and the Battle of Berlin entered its last stage. Within two weeks, Adolf Hitler was dead and the war in Europe was effectively over.
