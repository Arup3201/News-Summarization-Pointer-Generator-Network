Cameraman Huw Walters allegedly forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts. He denies three counts of fraud at Cardiff Crown Court

An award-winning cameraman forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts, before divorcing her, a court heard. 

Huw Talfryn Walters, 50, allegedly spent the money on buying expensive camera and photographic equipment.

But the court heard the freelance cameraman kept his spiralling money problems secret from his wife, Helen Bowen.  

The case was brought before a new jury after the original jury failed to reach a majority verdict in March this year. 

Cardiff Crown Court heard yesterday how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff.

During one application, he wrote: 'We need these funds urgently, so your speed in these matters would be welcome.'  

He then ended their 14-year marriage after telling his wife he needed to put their house up for sale.

Walters allegedly told Miss Bowers: 'I'm divorcing you because if I don't I'm going to go bankrupt.' 

Prosecutor John Davies said: 'Miss Bowen made a career change around 2005 and after that left the mortgage and bills to her husband who she trusted.

'They separated in December 2011 and not long after that she became aware the mortgage had increased without her agreement.

'She contacted the bank to obtain copies of the three withdrawals which increased the size of the mortgage by £59,000.

'She realised the signatures on them didn't belong to her - they were written by her husband without her knowledge while they still lived together.'

Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including the BBC Proms, Doctor Who and Channel 4's history show Time Team.

He has won two Welsh Baftas for his cinematography and camera work in recent years. 

The court heard Walters spent thousands of pounds on expensive camera equipment.

Mr
 Davies told the jury: 'A total of £59,000 was acquired using the fake 
signature of his then wife. He entered each signature having not 
consulted her or asked to consent.'

The court heard from a forensic handwriting expert, who proved Helen Bowen's signature had not been written by her - and was most likely written by her husband. 

Miss Bowers, a professional reflexologist, said she only discovered her husband had forged her signature a few months after their separation - when she was contacted by her mortgage provider.

When asked if she agreed to the mortgage withdrawals, she replied: 'No, not at all. If I had been asked I would not have agreed to them.'

Walters, now of Maesteg, in Bridgend, denies three charges of fraud.

The trial continues.
