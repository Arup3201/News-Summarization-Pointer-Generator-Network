When you're thinking about where to do your shopping for the perfect summer wardrobe your local supermarket probably won't pop into your head.

But Eliza Scarborough has found that this summer you can forget your usual ports of call on the High Street and head down to Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda for some stylish - and cheaper - alternatives.

You might instantly head to Debenhams or Monsoon if you need a frock for a wedding or special occasion. But since Sainsbury’s doubled its design team on own-label Tu last year, and invested heavily in fabrics and workmanship, they’ve become a real alternative to the High Street. Fresh designs, such as this floral frock, are perfect for summer weddings or formal events. The hour-glass style flatters curves, while the tailored pleat gives you a neat silhouette.

Shoes, £25, and dress, £25, www.F-F.com

Forget more expensive shoes at old reliables such as Russell & Bromley or LK Bennett; Tesco is giving them a run for their money.

At the last count, the supermarket’s F&F range had more than 350 shoe styles available to buy online, though the choice in store is understandably smaller. Shoes come in sizes 3 to 8 and they are always comfortable, often with padded soles and ankle straps.

They also have a choice of brands other than their own, including Dunlop and Dolcis.

This pair costs £25, but the zip detail and chain trim makes them look far more expensive.

Topshop and Zara are renowned for interpreting high fashion. But did you know Asda, too, has become adept at churning out catwalk copies at the drop of a hat? It has even had its own catwalk show in one of its North London stores.

Among the clothes was this drop-waist dress that’s not dissimilar to Victoria Beckham’s ‘blanket dress’. Hers costs £855, but this can be yours for £16. Better yet, it’s far easier to wear than the billowing original, thanks to the clever cut.

Coat, £28, shirt, £6, skirt, £10 and shoes, £16, asda.com

When you have to buy  an outfit for the office workwear, take a minute before rushing out to give your credit card a bashing at Hobbs or Jigsaw — Asda has a great line which is unbelievably cheap. Its best-selling £6 white shirt is crisp and well-tailored and it does wonderfully tapered trousers, also £6. This white coat is a useful summer cover-up and looks like it means business. A stretchy midi-length skirt is another great option. The perfect length, so you don’t scare your boss, and comfy enough to sit in all day at your desk, it comes in a variety of prints and flatters curves.

Sweater, £55, skirt, £20, and shoes, £19.50, www.F-F.com

If
 you’re hunting for knitwear, head to F&F, rather than your usual 
ports of call such as John Lewis or M&S. It’s the only supermarket 
that stocks cashmere all year round.

This coral V-neck is 100 per cent 
cashmere and is fantastic value.

A similar jumper at  M&S will set 
you back £99. It’s soft and fluffy, isn’t prone to sagging or bobbling 
and can be washed on a delicate machine cycle.

Petite dress, £35, and shoes, £20, www.F-F.com

Have
 a figure outside the norm and think you’ll never get a supermarket to 
tailor for you? You’d be wrong. F&F is your new best friend, as it 
caters comprehensively for all figures with dedicated tall, plus-size 
and petite ranges. It ensures its key pieces — like this monochrome tea 
dress — are manufactured in all three categories, as well as the 
standard size. This ‘petite’ dress has a higher waistband and shorter 
hem. Curvy options have a more generous cut, and tall makes sure there’s
 enough fabric to cover those long legs.

FIGURE FIXING AT SAINSBURY'S

Women
 desperate to nip in their figures might head to Reiss or Karen Millen 
for some chic tailoring. But try Sainsbury’s instead — it has the best 
figure-fixing clothing. The secret is in the super-sharp designs. Take 
this dress, which has a robust integral control slip to smooth the 
stomach and streamline thighs. It’s reminiscent of designer Roland 
Mouret’s hourglass frocks — but it’s only £40.

And don’t stop at the 
dresses. A pair of Sainsbury’s skinny jeans, £14, are sold every second.

Bra, £8, briefs, £4, asda.com

if
 you instinctively head to M&S for everyday undies — and a mid-range
 designer  like Elle Macpherson for something a little more special — 
you now have a supermarket alternative: Asda.

One of the hidden gems of 
the lingerie world, its underwear costs peanuts. The pieces fit well, 
but still look feminine with lace edges and detailing. It also has a 
T-shirt bra — one of their bestsellers — that costs just £4. And the 
detail on these pleated chiffon briefs makes them a dead ringer for one 
of Elle Macpherson’s designs.
