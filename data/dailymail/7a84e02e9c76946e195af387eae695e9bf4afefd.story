Social media is buzzing with ways to flood a politician's office with bogus job advertisements after the federal government revealed those on the dole would be forced to apply for 40 jobs a month if they want to receive benefits.

Unemployed Australians under 30 years of age will need to send a number of job applications to potential employers every month to avoid their Newstart payments being cut off under the government's proposed employment and welfare changes.

Businesses have raised concerns they could be flooded with fake resumes from people just trying to fill their quota, but the government has warned penalties could be dished out to those not making genuine efforts to find work, The Australian reports.

Employment Minister Eric Abetz and Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced proposed welfare changes, which means unemployed people will have to apply for 40 jobs a month to receive benefits

Parody job sites and tips on how to apply for jobs at members of parliament offices are currently doing the rounds on social media, including opposition members who have offered to accept resumes.

Tasmanian Labor state MP, Madeleine Ogilvie, told her Facebook followers she wasn't looking to hire but she was happy to take job applications as proof a person had applied for a job.

The Greens party are also offering to help by providing the contact details for every Coalition office.

'TheÂ  Macarthur Greens are dedicated to helping you. There are 90 Lower House Coalition MPs. There are 33 Upper House Coalition Senators. Each of these 123 Members of Parliament operate an electoral office that hires staffers,' the post read.

'We're sure these proud members of the august legislature of Australia will be thrilled by the initiative and energy being shown as you apply for a job at their electoral office.'

But a spokesman for Assistant Minister for Employment, Luke Hartsuyker, said jobseekers who don't use a range of ways to search for work or approach a range of potential employers may face financial penalties or payment suspensions.

Employment Minister Eric Abetz has said it could be a fair criticism that there's a risk of 'box-ticking' from jobseekers forced to apply for the 40 jobs, which is set to come into effect next July.

GetUp created their own job application to send Senator Abetz for the 'job of fixing his broken policy'

'We as a government do not want box-ticking to place place,' he told Lateline.

'We don't want red tap and inconvenience to employers, but what we do want is a genuine attempt by the job seekers to obtain employment.'

Business is concerned about the efficacy of the job search arrangements, saying it would be better if people concentrated on jobs they had the best chance of obtaining.

But Senator Abetz says the unemployed shouldn't be choosy about the type of jobs available and any work experience is beneficial.

'There are clearly some job snobs around,' he said.

'We do need to encourage them, for their own sake, for their own benefit - to get them off welfare, into employment.'
