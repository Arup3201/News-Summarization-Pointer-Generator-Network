Stefan Johansen wants Celtic to show how good a team they are by bouncing back against Ross County on Saturday.

The Scottish Premiership leaders lost the chance to increase their lead at the top of the table to seven points when they lost 2-1 to Dundee United at Tannadice on Sunday.

The defeat brought an end to Celtic's eight-game winning run in the league and left them four points ahead of United and Aberdeen.

The Norwegian midfielder wants to make amends against the struggling Staggies - although he highlighted the need to take their chances.

'It was a game we wanted to win but couldn't do it,' Johansen told Celtic's official website.

'They scored two easy goals but we had enough chances to win the game so it's disappointing.

'Their early goal didn't unsettle us. We knew what they were going to do - sit back and counter-attack - and we were confident we would get our goals but it was just one of those days.

'We needed to keep a high tempo and we created some chances but didn't take them.

'Good teams bounce back right away so we will just focus on training well and focus on that game because we want to get back on the winning run.

'Ross County always try to defend and then counter-attack but if we do our own things well enough, then we should beat them and that's what we have to focus on.'

Johansen apologised to those Hoops fans who made the trip to Tayside and hopes home advantage will make the difference against County.

He said: 'The fans were fantastic at Tannadice and it was a joy to play in front of them so I'd like to say sorry that we couldn't win.

'It's a bit easier at home. It's a big pitch and you have the fans with you. Hopefully we can win.'
