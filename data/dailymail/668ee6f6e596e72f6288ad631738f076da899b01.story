AZ Alkmaar coach Marco van Basten is taking a break from football until mid-September to recover from a health problem.

The former Ajax and AC Milan striker is being given 'more time to rest' said AZ in a statement on Wednesday.

AZ's director of football Earnest Stewart revealed the club doctor has advised that 'rest will speed up the recovery' of 49-year-old Van Basten, who was absent from his team's 3-1 win at Dordrecht on Saturday.
